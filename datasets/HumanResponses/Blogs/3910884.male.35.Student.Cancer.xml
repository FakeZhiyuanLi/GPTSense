       Leadership/COOP Seminar     For 2-days of the seminar, the costs are about PHP 3000 which feeds around 20-30 people per day.    Blessing in disguise that only Sitio Pilien showed up. Would sugges that other workshops be about this size as well. Quality not quantity.    Also suggested that workshops for youth leaders and possibly kalakalan be encouraged.    Interesting idea would be to set up a school in Sitio Bacolod which is the first sitio you reach on the way to Pilien (Bacolod is roughly the half-way point).  For the children who live farther, a small dormitory could be built and to keep the teacher in the community perhaps a small staff house could also be built.

       Political Levels in the Philippines      National   President  Vice-President  Deaprtment of Justice  Speaker of the House  Senate President     Provincial   Governor (3-year term)  Vice-Governor  Board Member (6-year term)  Congressman (3-year term)     Town Level   Mayor (3-year term)  Vice-Mayor  Municipal/City Council     Barangay   Barangay Captain  Sangguniang Kabataan (Barangay Council)     Government Warnings:     Government warings are in English.  However not everyone in the Philippines speaks English let alone reads English. As a matter of fact, many of the remote populations don't even read their local dialect.     Government Borrowing:     Philippines borrowed almost $80 billion from the World Bank. 40% of the current Philippine budget goes to paying off what is owed on the loan. It's no wonder that very little in terms of resources are funnelled to social services in the Philippines since most of the budget goes to the military and road infrastructure.

      I was informed that there's a commission examing indigenous issues however I'm unaware of any 'Office of Indigenous Affairs' so I need to look that up. Also, I need to find out if there is an 'Office of Rural Affairs' since these two 'offices' would definitely be stakeholders for the Aeta community.

      If the microloan program works in Pilien, PIlien can be used as a model community for building social capital and increasing community capacity. However there are two main issues that the Aeta in Pilien want to address:    1) Livelihood projects that not only ensure a steady income but also offers increased income over time.    2) Education for their children. Usually there are no educational opportunities for Aetas in Pilien unless they move to Santa Juliana or Maruglo. I was informed that there was once a school in Pilien and that a good road existed however after Mt. Pinatubo's eruption, the school was destroyed and the road was demolished.     Possible ideas    1) Follow-up with local and provincial government units to find out what the status is for building a new school,  2) Recruit local Aeta who would be interested in being teachers and educate them.

      The PHP 27,000 was split between the 10 tribal council members. They in turn took the PHP 2,700 each and split it up among friends and family members they knew they could trust in regards to paying back the microloans.    The responsibility is shared among the 10 tribal council members and reduces the chances that one person (or group) would monopolize the funds usage and allows self-monitoring of the tribal council. Most of the money went to farmers who grow rice and have already developed a long-term (6-month goal) by either:  1) selling ready-to-cook rice which takes some time but fetches a higher price,  2) selling the rice seeds to other farmers.    Those who borrowed PHP 1,000 are expecting to make PHP 400 at the end of the 6-month project.

      Of special interest is an increase of Ilocanos that are moving into Aeta communities. Most of these Ilocanos I was told would be homeless if they didn't move into the community however in the Aeta community they have the opportunity to own their own home and land.

      Sitio Pilien is an Aeta community remotely located about 10-miles from Barangay Maruglo, Capas, Tarlac. The only non-natural looking structure in the community is the deep well situated in the middle of the village which was installed a few years ago.    The children here are playful although I noticed some possible protein malnourishment atypical with hair light-brown hair coloration of children who would normally have dark brown or black hair. They are inquisitive and active. There is no school here and I doubt the parents would want them to walk the 10-miles to the nearest barangay.     There are no medical facilities here so pretty much they are on their own should an emergency arise.    Pilien has been around since WWII. The residents remember fighting the Japanese in the mountains before finally settling at Pilien. Previous to this there are no records since the Aetas tended to be nomadic prior to their need for permanent settlements.    How they make a 'living.' Many people (adults and children) collect lahar stones that are used in denim 'stone washing' techniques. Each bag which weighs maybe 20 kgs fetches a price of PHP 4. Illegal logging is also a source of income with many households collecting around PHP 300 per tree they chop down. There is also some farming however I think for most of the people it's for personal sustenance rather than an income source.    Recently this community received PHP 27,000 for livelihood projects. This microloan will be paid back with interest (6% annually). I'm curious to see how this ends up.    In 1995, the local Aeta communities were involved in a PHP 2 million project funded by the U.N. which completley failed due to mismanagement issues:    1) Goats that were supposed to go to community members were instead given to only a few poeple.  2) Casavas that were planted and supposedly that were promised to be bought weren't.

      Aetan community at Sitio Calapi, meeting with some home study participants. Angelicum volunteer hasn't been around since October. Volunteer was supposed to help tutor them.    They have problems with math, science, and english.    They are looking for tutors to assist them with their questions.    Limited resources for tutoring. Possible primary school teachers as a tutor source. Volunteers would probably come from a different location.

      Went to Sitio Calapi (Barnagay Marcos Village in Mabalacat) and met with the tribal council. Noticed a few things and were told a few things.    1) No centralized human waste. They just go 'where ever.' Possible human waste contamination due to bare-foot traffic through those same areas.  2) No centralized area for garbage. Again garbage is strewn 'where ever.'  3) Village states that well water is causing diarhea. Possible contamination of well due to watershed location (the well is located on a hill however the watershed may lie underneath a contaminated stream bed).  Suggested water be tested by Department of Health.  4) Noticed that chemical contamination in stream leading from village to lahar.  5) Villagers also complained of asthma and other respiratory problems. The village is very near Clark Airbase and probably has a history of pollutants being dropped on them. Garbage is also burned in the community creating toxic smoke. Smoking also prevalent with adults smoking around young children.  6) Educational services have declined in the sitio. Committment by the Department of Education has waned and support of the Calapi Elementary School is mininal (the teachers are there 3 times a week for 4 hours at a time and the parents are complaining the children aren't learning). Grade level maximum is grade 4.

      Interview with kids:    The program started in May 2003.    Why home study?  * Regular public school is still expensive for some families that need to buy supplies, transportation, and food for the kids who are attending school.  * Relatively no supplies (just a work book) so costs are minimal.  * Parents as well as children work in some families so there's no time for children to attend traditional schooling.    Suggestion by the kids:  * Review more often to go over questions and answers in the work book.  * Have optional times for reviews so the students can maximize their review sessions.  * Most problems are with science and english with less concern in math and reading.    The modules are handed to the kids. The kids fill out the modules and the modules are sent to Angelican college for grading. If the kids pass the module, they can take a test to rise to the next grade level.

      The Aetas are definitely a marginalized society with little to no resources available to them. In 1995 almost PHP 2 million were given to the Aetas in Capas by the United Nations for livelihood development.  Unfortunately the money went to only a few government and tribal officials with a majority of the Aetas not seeing a single centavo due to mismanagement by government officials and Aeta tribal leaders.    M.O.A. went off without a hitch. Leadership classes are scheduled for later this month to go over responsibilities of loan agreement.    Guerilla activity in the location I'm going to. There are several factions of the NPA. The most active being the New People's Army and the the break off faction the Prolitariat Revolutionary Army.    The older and more stable is the NPA and in the process of winning 'hearts and minds' in that instead of robbing people, they ask for donations, ie. revolutionary taxes. The PRA is rumored to be funded by the government and that they extort money from the local population. Because of their mixed ideologies it's not uncommon for both groups to clash.    A few months ago about 100 NPA were in the Aeta village we're travelling to. For the most part the encounter was peaceful (the NPA were in the village looking for potable water). The tribal chief requested that the NPA leave which they did.    The military came looking for them 2-days later. 20 people died along with 5 civilians.    Also in the area are bandit groups that extort money from the local barangays. The military was dispatched and drove the bandits away but were unable to catch any of the bandits.

      Aetas are seen as a 'lazy people' by other Filipinos. I asked what they did for fun and they mentioned that they wonder what they will eat the next day. Actually the Aeta I've met have been very industrious so I'm sure this popular misconception is unfounded.    Arnel explained that the Aetas live for the present and do not generally have any long term goals. However the leadership and organization courses that are scheduled later this month will be the first steps towards the Aetas having a substantial community plan and direction, self-management and hopefully empowerment.    The Aetas eat like there's no tomorrow. I was told that it was because they usually don't eat too much when they are back home (just kasavas) and we were providing food for the tribal councils so they seriously grubbed.

      Aetas usually stop education after elementary school for financial reasons since access to high school is limited and costly.    Of the 8,000 Aetas in the Pampanga region, very few if any have an education higher than elementary.     My concerns in regards to my clothing was confirmed when Arnel explained that the Aetas mistrust the military because of being caught in the cross-fire of NPA and military. They are also targeted by the military on raids for weapons and confiscating weapons the Aeta use for hunting.

      Refuse in the provinces are usually burned. Kind of toxic if you think about it with all that plastic being burned as well.    There will be 3 sitios (tribal villages). Each village will receive PHP 27,000  for their livelihood projects which will be paid back at 6% interest annually.    The Microloan Aggreement:    1-year at 6% interest. Half paid off by the first 6-months. Fully paid off within 1-year. Enough in microloans to give each family in the sitios about PHP 1,000 for farming, garden needs, etc.

      Local Aeta villages are actively engaged in watershed protection through a grant by the Department of Ecology. The grant is renewable every 25-years. The Aeta plant fruit bearing and indigenous trees to fight erosion, deforrestation, and to protect watershed and well locations.    Most deforrestaion occurs illegally with local government units (LGU's) turning a blind-eye.    About 1,100 saplings can be planted in a single hectare.    MOA set for PHP 27,000 per sitio.    Zambaleno (Zambales) is the language spoken by the Aeta in Tarlac.    Additional fruits that are harvested are sold for extra income.    Useful phrases:    Saan ako makakabibili ng ..... ? = Where can I buy ..... ?  Magkano ang ..... ? = How much is ..... ?  Meron ba ang ..... dito? = Is there ..... here?  Ano naman po ang ginagawa mo kapag nasa bahay ka lang? = What do you do when you stay at home?    Wala pa po akong asawa?  May nobyo na ba kayo?  Puede ba kitang halikan?    Puede ba ako kumuha ang literato? = May I take your picture?  Gusto ko hong bumili ..... = I want to buy .....    What do Aetas do for 'fun?' Adult Aetas think about what they will eat tomorrow.    Fortune hunters still hunt for Yamashite's Gold in the mountains around the Aeta communities.    Aetas usually know several dialects in order to participate in different communities, for example, Tagalog, Pampangan, Ilocano, Zambalese, etc...    I can understand why the Aetas feel uncomfortable around the military since there is a log-standing distrust of them when many Aetas would simply 'disappear' during the Marcos regime.

      Orientation for MOA signing Location: Barangay Maruglo, Sta. Juliana, Tarlac Departure: 7/9/04, 0900hrs, Angeles City, Pampanga Arrive: 7/9/04, 1100hrs, Baranga Maruglo, Sta. Juliana, Tarlac Actual Signature Date: 7/10/04 by 3 Aeta sitios located near Barangay Maruglo.  MOA was desgined by Aeta tribal councils in association with AWECA Foundation. Money from the micro-loan will be decided on by each seperate tribal council via vote.  Other concerns are possible deep and shallow well projects for the Aeta communities.  ***** HAZARDS *****  Military activity in the area (low level). Aeta communities are located near military reserve. Bandit activity is also present (Barangay Maruglo was recently the target of an exhtortion attempt in June by about 20 bandits wanted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) which prompted an increase in the military presence in the local region - the bandits are still at large). New People's Army (NPA) and Proliteriat Revolutionary Army (PRA) has also been spotted in the vacinity (armed conflict occured with the NPA and Philippine Army as recently as March with 20 killed, 5 of them being civilian non-combatants caught in the crossfire).   Thought for the day: Discretion is the better part of valor.  Aeta Overview: Over 8,000 rural Aeta in the area. Education level for these Aeta's rarely exceeds primary school level (if educated at all). The Aeta community has become marginalized and displaced by non-Aeta communities encroaching into their habitat and because the land they live on are not government enforced or regulated reserves (ie. no indigenous population reservations exist in the vicinity of Barangay Maruglo).  AWECA Foundation conuducts census information on Aeta communities that they work with.

      Potable Water Access * Target Population - Aeta tribal populations located in remote areas of Pampanga (mostly near Tarlac) and that do not have access ti potable water due to location living areas (remote areas in the mountains). Many have access to non-potable river water that is currently being used maybe be contaminated with chemicals and/or bacteria. Therefore, the AWECA Foundation has coordintated the drilling of several wells to support rural Aeta villages who have currently compromised water sources. Clean sources of water are important for increasing community capacity because it reduces issues concerning poor health. Stakeholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (coordinate the drilling) 2) Government participation (as needed however I believe the current deep wells were created through private donors) 3) Private Donors (source for supplies and money for the deep well) 4) Aeta Villagers (the recipients of the deep wells).  Would be interesting to conduct a before and after health survey to see if the deep wells made any health impacts on the lives of the Aeta villagers.

      Environmental (Re-forestation of de-nuded areas): * Community where planting takes place and usually where de-forestation threatens the community. Planting also occurs in areas where the water table is threatened due to run-off caused by de-forestation. Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (primary source of project funds) 2) Government divisions that support and fund projects (unfortunately none if any have offered to participate) 3) Aeta Communities (primary recipients of the projects) 4) Private Donors (majority of fund source funds comes from private donors)  Education (Out-of-School Youth and the Home Study Program) * Target population are those youth who have dropped out of school. Most reasons are for financial purposes. Many don't continue their schooling (primary or secondary) because they can't afford the cost of education (eg. school books, supplies, and transportation, are several factors affecting access to education). In addition the Home Study Program affects AWECA employees who have none or limited education (4th grade maximum is the average) as well as Aeta villagers who have various barriers and limited resources needed for an education (eg. lack of income to pay for school supplies and books, lack of transportation to a school, and lack of sustenance during schooling). Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (Primary source of project funds) 2) Government divisions that support and fund projects (again, very little government involvement) 3) Private Donors (majority of funding of projects come from this source) 4) Angelicum College in Manila (creates the curriculum for the Home Study Program) 5) Children (the recipients of the Home Study Program course work) 6) Parents (the parents of the children who themselves may not be educated) 7) Schools and Teachers (as a resource to assist in the Home Study Program) 8) AWECA Employees (adult education recipients) 9) Aeta Villages (aduly and children eduction recipients)  Capacity Building Program (Micro-Loan Project) * Target Population - Small business entrepeneuers who wish to borrow money in order to start a small business that is self-supporting and sustainable with loan amounts averaging a little under $400 U.S. and which is repaid over 1-year at 6% interest. This was created so that the recipients would understand that the micro-loan was not a donation or gift but rather that they would need to work on getting the loan paid off so that they could qualify for future loans when they needed it (eg. cacelation of the 'doling out' mentality). Shareholders- 1) AWECA Foundation (micro-loan coordinators) 2) Peace and Equity Foundation (lenders, total is PHP 27,000.00 to be divided as the Aeta tribal councils see fit) 3) Aeta Villagers (the micro-loan recipients, however in order reduce any type of nepotism or corruption, the tribal council agrees to who gets what in regards to the micro-loan such that no one person has complete control of fund distribution)

      Had the opportunity to do two site visits with primary (grades 1-6) and secondary (high school grades 1st through 4th year) and college students.  Many parents and participants stated that without the scholarships offered, many of the students would not have the opportunity to attend school because of the poverty level that many of the families are living in.  Most (if not all) live in small houses on private owned or government owned land and face the posibility of eviction. Many homes are ramshackle conglomerations of lahar-created bricks, rusted tin roofs, and plastic sindings with no window covers.  Most of the families are large with some having as many as 8 children and being in a single-parent home with a spouse that has succumbed to either an illness or tragic accident.  The main concern of the parents as well as the children are those of income:  1) An increase in their allowance from the foundation. Currently the allowance is 20 pesos a day however this often supplemented by the parents since the students need roughly 30 pesos a day and when the single bread winner only makes PHP 250 or so a day to feed the family, you can see the obvious financial strain this produces on the family when the allowance is supplemented out of pocket by the family.  2) One parent asked if there was a chance for the children to participate in livelihood projects that would allow the children themselves to supplement their allowance. Some of the children work on the weekends and after school already which threatens the amount of quality studying time needed for their courses.  The foundation as well as the students and parents realize that to break the circle of poverty that they are subjected to is to become educated. With education comes opportunity and with opportunity comes the ability to make choices and to feel in control of ones life and with control comes empowerment and an improvement in one's quality of life.  The public school system in the RP is also stressed. Although public, tuition and books must still be paid by the students. Classes of 50 or so students with 5 or so students sharing a book is not unheard of.  Many of the public school students are motivated to be in school but because of financial reasons, must work to support their families. They mention that if they received an allowance, this would allow them more time to study. They also wish for more technical skills like being familiar with computers. They also hope to continue their education to high school and even into college.  All in all, small steps are being taken to reduce education gaps in the Philippines but the educational system is overworked and underfunded. Interventions are needed to supplement the struggling education system so that these motivated students can achieve their dreams and so that the chain of poverty is broken.

      I just thought about treating social justice issues using disaster response as a template. I think it's possible to treat social justice issues in the Philippines as a disaster such that recipients receive aid that increases their level of human dignity based on the Humanitarian Charter of the U.N.    http://www.sphereproject.org    Must also remember to get a book by Sionil Jose recommended by Chiara. There's a National Bookstore at the Nepo Mall but I was told that there's a larger one over at SM Mall in San Fernando.

Buffalo Boarding and Rice Surfing     Not in the sense you're boarding a buffalo like a pirate (ahoy mateys! thar be a buffalo! avast ye and board her! aaargh!) but in the sense you're using a board to 'ski' behind the water buffalo or 'surf the rice' as the case may be.    So the premise is this, a boarder, using a snowboard or a smallish surfboard (a boogie board might be better) is pulled by a water buffalo across the rice paddy. The hard part is having the water buffalo maintain momentum such that the boarder maintains movement so he can do some totally gnarly moves bra!  (you have to say the last 4 words with a Keanu Reeves accent).    Speaking of Keanu, did you know that my Hawaiian name is Keoni? It was given to me by one of the staff at the hospital I worked at in Hawaii. According to her, you can only be given a Hawaiian name by someone with Hawaiian ancestry (she's 3/4 Hawaiian, nice lady, good with drawing blood and IV sticks, teaches hula). So after she named me Keoni (which is just John in Hawaiian), the rest of the kama aina staff (Hawaii born locals)  started calling me Keoni. I got used to it that I almost never responded to John. :)

       Last day of the 'Pilien' leadership workshop. Was meant to be for all the other Aeta sitios but only Pilien showed up because of the bad weather we've been having here. Blessing in disguise really since it's easier to train smaller groups.    Have to get a song called 'the APL song.' Rap song about Filipino 'ghettos.'    Here's a sort of retraction.    Seems that Pampangans  DO  yell when they speak. Usually happens between the older generations especially in the country however some older people in the city do so as well.    As it was explained to me, it's because they're showing off and want people to know they're there. They used to dress very flashy as well, wearing lots of American goods and clothes but the flashy dress doesn't happen so much since the bases are gone.    Seeing the Pilien tribal council leave is like seeing a good depart. I wish them the best of luck!

       Those with more must sacrifice more. Those with less are already living a life of self-sacrifice...     They keep playing GMA's SONA over and over on the radio. I'm curious how she'll get the rich to pay more taxes when so many of the rich are prominent senators, congressmen, governors, mayors, etc...    Unfortunately it's usually the other way around when the poor will always have to sacrifice more than the rich.    Funny that politicians (much like in the U.S.) will spend millions of pesos for their campaigns, money that could be spent on social services like sending kids to school, feeding the poor, creating affordable housing, indentifying and addressing social injustices, etc...    LOL! GMA should have said 'will' instead of 'must' because 'must' sounds like a request but at least 'will' sounds like a command.    Who's to say thise rich fat-cats are going to sacrifice more based on their conscious or good-nature? Doubt it...    Japanayuki's in Maruglo! I ws told they're pinay 'entertainers' that travel to Japan every 6-months (every 6-months they need a new visa with a new name since I guess you can't work in Japan for more than 6-months ever). Anyways, I was told they make pretty good money and that they remit a lot back to the Philippines. They're just one type of the 1.4 million overseas Filipino workers (OFW's).    There was a leadership exercise on drawing our successes and dreams. Many people from Pilien (the Aeta sitio) drew houses and homes as accomplishments and drew larger houses and more land as dreams.

      Ok, back in Maruglo. Special guests today are Denise and Tito from Ayala Foundation, 'Aggie' Aguilar a leadership instructor, and of course the Aeta tribal councils from the neighboring sitios and the COOP members living in Maruglo.    The next 3-days will be spent on leadership courses, management training, and program accountability. I think someone had mentioned out of school youth but I'm not sure about that. All in all it should be pretty cool, especially if it stops raining...    [ Later that day... ]    Participated in a leadership meeting with the local barangay cooperative that specializes in loaning money. Capital interest for this group was started through the Aweca Agro business to start the COOP. Aweca kind of reminds me of a local Angeles City Ayala.     Word of the Day:      Bayanihan : helping each other out without compensation.    Woah, flash back time (this is when my vision gets all wiggly as I reminisce).    Just flashing back. I think my first real kiss, I mean real passionate kiss was a stage kiss.    LOL! I had to rehearse the kiss and I was so nervous during rehearsals because I had never kissed a girl that way before...    But when it happened on stage, it seemed so right. It happened smoothly. I totally forgot about the audience and was enthralled by the feelings both physically and emotionally...    I have to smile because the first real kiss, passionate kiss, was shared on stage with an actress and an audience, and the stage crew...    The way my lips touched hers, then slowly our tongues touched and ewtwined. The moment seemed to last forever and at the same time only for an instant...     I didn't realize I was holding my breath and I let out a sight when our lips parted. My friends in the audience, being the dorks they are, started 'ooohhhing' and 'aaaahhhing' and giggling. But actually I didn't care. I had this big smile on my face and the experience was beautiful and I was just enjoying the after effects...    Not sure what brought about this memory but it was a happy memory and is one of many that I will cherish as long as I exist...    [ Even later that day... ]    Wow, the leadership course/class was pretty cool. Understood some of it but it was mostly in Kampampangan so I wasn't too familiar with everything but atleast some of the words looked familiar and some of the aspects looked similar to what I learned, read, and experienced myself.    It's been raining on and off all day so I'm not totally surprised that some of the Aetas show up around 5:00 PM. They'll spend the night for the class tomorrow. They're motivated to take the class and have been probably walking in the rain the whole day, the whole way...     Side note:     Funny that the government warnings here to safeguard your health (eg. the warning labels on packs of cigarettes) are in English. Not sure how many Aetas can read English (or other people in the Philippines for that matter). Warning labels here should be in Pilipino so everyone could read them (if everyone knew how to read).

      Okay, first off,  I AM NOT BOLERO!!!  What a naughty rumor! ;)  Was invited to a wedding yesterday about 10 minutes before it started. Yup, it was like the Filipino weddings in the U.S. with a dozen pair of sponsors, etc... One thing about FilAms is that many of the customs that are parents are familiar with are shared with us wether or not we want them shared. :)  For example, things I won't share (as in I'll kindly not participate in):  * eating balut * eating bitter melon  Saw the art exhibit in Angeles also (it's a block down from the Holy Rosary church). Was very cool. Very nice art. I wrote a hay(na)ku for the curator.  Speaking of hay(na)ku's, I started another blog page for them. You can find them at:   urlLink http://johnaku.blogspot.com   Read an article today about the 'Let's Pretend Campaign.' Was a very good article and very inspiring to say the least. The gist was that let's pretent that we (Filipinos) do live in a first world/developed country, and for one day, pretend that we can achieve what others think we can't. I'll have to keep the article with me and share it with my kababayan when I meet up with them again...

      Wow,  Filipinos here love aircon. There's an aircon store on every block in seems. Michelle was right, I should have brought a ski jacket with me (maybe I'll bring my sweatshirt with me where ever I go...). :)  You don't even see that many in the Bay Area but then again it's usually freezing/foggy in SF 24-7, 365 anyways.     Well, had camerones today. Not as in shrimp as you Spanish speakers might think but BUGS! I was told it was a delicacy in Pampamga. Not so bad, yup crunchy, like shrimp if you didn't peel them. Kinda looks like grasshoppers or something (I was told it was like miniature locusts or something). Well, if Moses could eat them, I reckon they couldn't all that bad (it was actually quite yummy and I know bugs are nutritious, for example, cockaroaches are 90% protein!).    Yup it's raining today. If the aircon of everyone in the Philippines was turned outwards we'd be in 4 feet of snow by now across all the islands. No joke lang!    Oh yeah, it's hay(na)ku (not how I spelled it the other day.

      I wish I brought a pillow. Sleeping on wood planks suck but I bet my back is better for it.    We take so much for granted in the U.S. where the middle class is so large and that we're able to or have the opportunity to live with so many amenities.    In the Philippines there is a huge poor population (maybe up to 70%) with a small middle class and an even smaller upper class (as usual, it's the relative few that dictates the direction of the masses).    I was curious how much my companions earn. One makes about PHP 7,500 (about $150) a month while the other makes PHP 10,000 (about $200) a month. I figured they would be making about $500 U.S. a month. I felt awkward when they asked me how much I made which is about PHP 180,000 (as a student). But then the cost of livining in the U.S. is so expensive. You can rent a nice house in the Philippines for about PHP 9,000 where in the U.S. my shared rent for the house is about PHP 35,000.     I need to go CD shopping. One good way to learn about a culture is through it's music...

      What a stark contrast I've had during this experience in regards  to sleeping arrangements. In Angeles I sleep in a very well to do home in a large bed with aircon. Here in Pilien it's a wooden board with aircon provided by mother nature. A dog licked my toes and jumped on the bed while I was sleeping. Scared the bejeebus out of me because I thought the aswang were after me!    The similarities between both situations are that both families are honest, hard-working families who also volunteer what little time they have to become community leaders and to lend a hand in their own communities.    Just a quick note:    When visiting an Aeta community, for your comfort, it's better to treat the experience as a 'camping trip.' Keeping this in mind worked quite well for me.    On the way back down the THREE MOUNTAINS AND FOUR RIVERS:    OMG! I was resigned to walking down the 3 mountains and 4 rivers on treacherous mud paths looking over precarious gorges and thought it couldn't get any worse. Surprise surprise! It rained for about 2-hours while we were making it down the mountain (which is about half-way through the trip). Walking for 10-miles in wet underwear is very uncomfortable, so here are my suggestions.    For those of you who are lacking tsinelas finese and mountain goat skills, I would suggest wearing calve-length boots (hiking or old military boots should do). During the rainy season for you fellas out there, I would suggest free-balling it. Probably not so big a deal during the summer.     Anyways, the remoteness of the village outlines the stark reality of marginalized culture. Being in the bundoks, or mountains, illustrates how people can be forgotten and ignored despite their cries for opportunity (I'll elaborate more in my field notes).

      Have to pick up a song by Jay-R called  Bakit Pa Ba  or something like that and  Forever's Not Enough  by Sarah Geronimo. Okay, so the hike should be 3-hours long. Should be fun!    So some things to remember for FilAms. There isn't toilet paper (generally) in the Philippines. Of course there are always exceptions like businesses, posh hotels, and museums. So start practicing using that tabo or water hose to wash your puet!     Some notes on fractionalization:    Even the insurgent groups are fractionalized such that they fight each other as well as the government troops. Also there are redundant offices such that some offices don't know who is in charge of what since they have similar responsibilities.    I wonder what miracles could be accomplished if Filipinos worked together for a united nation more often, EDSA, People Power, beheadings of oversea Filipino workers.    Thought for the day:    The whole is greater than the sum of all its parts...    Filipinos are so soulfull, listen to our music. :)     Later That Day:    Sweet Jesus!      Okay so the hike to Pilien makes the hike to Calapi look like a walk in the park. Walked (literally!) up-hill for 10-miles in the mud and when I mean mud, it's the kind you step in and lose your tsinelas (about calve-deep to me). Then we had to cross this river 4 times before reaching Pilien. Took a total of 4 1/2 hours. I was thoroughly exhausted. Tomorrow we'll walk back to Maruglo but despite the mud I'm looking forward to it since it's down hill.    Nice in Pilien in that there's relatively no pollution (the occasional cigarette butt and candy wrapper).     People keep staring at me because i'm putik. I feel like I'm on dispaly. ;)    Okay, so here's a chance for me to demystify some concepts that were told to me prior to leaving the U.S.:    1) Kampampangans DO NOT sound like birds chirping when talking...  2) Kampampangans DO NOT yell when talking...    See what happens when regional stereotypes are mentioned but unfounded. I think we all need to visit another part of the Philippines just to get some cultural experience from our own countrymen.    For example, red necks are in bred but how should I know? I hate Texas (except for San Antonio!) sucks, lol! Even in the U.S. we have our own regional biases.    However I have to agree that Angeles City is where it's at. Didn't see much happening in San Fernando. I was told there was a huge robot in San Fernando but it eluded me. :(    Oh yeah, I need to remind Mrs. Palo that the field officers need motorcycles for Pilien.      A note on critical consciousness:     In the U.S. we take critical consciousness for granted in that a majority of the people don't exercise their rights to question authority. In the Philippines you have to be careful of what you say otherwise the Philippine National Police or military intelligence might pick you up for 'questioning' since you're acting like a 'subversive.'    Okay so some more thinking at Pilien. There's not much to do here after we've met with the tribal chief and his council (more in my field notes).     On the travel advisory to the Philippines... Just because GMA doesn't want to play Bush's bullshit game, his administration slaps the travel warning advisory on the Philippines. Bush's advisory is so transparent, his actions so visible, his reasons so apparent that it really laughable! The Philippines was safe while the troops were in Iraq and now the Philippines are unsafe because GMA recalls them a month ahead of schedule?    What is Bush afraid of? Seeing a country that isn't listening to his bullshit and kow-towing like some of the other servant-states (Britain, Australia, Japan, ie. Coalition of the Bossed Around) to the Bush administration? Is Bush afraid that the U.S. is seen as an uncaring company and the Philippines as a compassionate one? Too late, the whole world fears or hates the U.S. administration (take your pick!). To hell with Bush! What a jackass! It's no wonder that over half the U.S. citizens 'dislike' Bush. I just wish we'd have the balls in the U.S. to take back our hijacked country from the terrorists living in the White House. I can only hope that the November elections pushes Bush out of the Oval Office.    It's so nice to be happy!  Everyone should be happy!    Sex Bomb girls are the bomb! LOL!     Empowerment from a social epidemiology point of view begins with the opportunity of self-rule and choice.

      If I had a peso for every guy I saw peeing on a wall... No shame, it could be rush hour and some guy is peeing on a wall... :)    If forever isn't long enough to love you,   I'd spend another  life time to love you too.    I was feeling a little melancholy today.     Okay so I think this was brought about by a bunch of Filipino R&B songs being played. The Filipinos have a very romantic culture (sometimes in a fatalistic way!).     Seeing her walk away,  Is like a sad song being sung.    My dad taught me to be old fashioned and to remember the old romantic ways and my mom taught me the importance of being independent and to understand another's need for independence.    Okay so we're in Maruglo. Going to meet with the out-of-school youth this afternoon and then hike up the mountains to meet with the Aetas in Pilien.     Like a Love Song   Her going away,  Like a love song being sung,  My heart weeps inside.     Back in Your Arms   If I can believe,  I'm back in your arms again,  Then that's where I'll end.     Good-Byes   Good-byes are so sad,  No promises between us,  That we'll meet again.     Washed Away   Rain falls from the sky,  The skies display my feelings,  My pain washed away.

      Not much to add about this day. Spent the morning at mass at the Holy Rosary Church in Angeles and then had lunch with Mrs. Palo and her daughters and mostly answered questions about life in the U.S.    After lunch I was dropped back off at Mr. Feliciano's house and just contemplated/meditated (medicated? lol!) about nothing in general. Sounds very zen I think since I was contemplating 'nothingness' lol.  I suppose it shouldn't be so odd since I consider myself a Taoist by philosophy and a Roman Catholic by religion although I think my views on religion are very progressive and would probably raise a few eyes at the least.    Anyways, a nice quiet day for self reflection and contemplation. Tomorrow is the big hike to Pilien.

      Spent the day travelling through Porac and Bacalor to examine the devastation wrought by the lahar. Lahar is a mixture of volcanic ash and water which forms a thick, viscous mud. Yearly rainy seasons since the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo have been devastating to the Pampangan region with several towns being totally immersed and buried in lahar.    Despite the devastation created by the lahar, the Kampampangans have overcome their misfortunes and have rebuilt their lives sometimes literally above their burried homes. Again their attitude to overcome obstacles and tradgedies is apparent in their daily struggle to overcome adversity.     Also visited several beautiful churches (some affected tremendously and some unscathed), made some wishes and said some prayers.

      So there were a few things that popped out at me:    1) Pangasinan cholera out-break  2) Pullout of Filipino troops  3) Resignation of Secretary Dinky    So, what's the big deal about pulling the troops out early? They were only leaving a month early anyways. Feel sorry for the U.S. troops who will be there for the net 10-years (Good morning Viet Nam!). Besides, why should Filipino blood be spilled over the terrible mistake made by the U.S. president by initiating an illegal war? So anyways, here are the facts (as seen by me!):    1) 51 Filipino troops won't make much of a difference when they leave compared to the 140,000 (and growing!) U.S. contingent already there.  2) The Filipino troops were going to leave in 30-days anyways.  3) U.S., Australia, Japan, etc... cry shame on the Philippines? Why? Beacuse the Philippines decides to not become even further implicit in this diabolical scheme concocted by the Bush administration? Kudos to GMA for standing up against them and not being bullied by the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' or should it be 'Coalition of the Spineless lackey's of the Bush Administration? Funny that the U.S. administration should disagree with GMA when over half of the U.S. citizens disagree with the Bush administration.  4) If we ever do find weapons of mass destruction, it'll be the ones we sold them back during the Regean era if the first place when the Iraq-Iran war was in full-swing (thanks Don Rumsfeld for making the sale back then!).   5) No links to Al Quaida and Saddam Hussein based on a U.S. congressional fact-finding report. Interesting huh Dubya? I'm not surprised really since Osama and Saddam are mortal enemies since Osama is a Islamic fundametalist and Saddam is Socialist (in the loosest terms) dictator. However since the U.S. is in Iraq, 'the enemy of my enemy is now my friend...' Thanks Bush for destabilizing the world and making a far more dangerous place!  6) If it's not about the oil, how come we don't know how many barrels of oil have been taken out of the country? Where is all the money from the oil that's supposed to rebuild the Iraqi infrastructure? How come the only building lfet standing and the first building to be secured was the Oil Ministry and not the Iraqi museum where priceless antiquities dating back several thousand years were looted?  7) Morale is quite different than what the Bush administration says. Less people are joining the military, soldiers are upset that they are receiving paycuts and are forced to stay longer in the military despite their official contracts ending and having to stay longer in the Middle East because there are less troops that can be stationed there (was a 6-month tour, now it's up to almost 15-months). What soldiers would be happy about that? Particularly part-time Reservists and National Guardsmen? More chances to die for a stupid cause of getting Bush and Cheney rich wouldn't make me happy.

Cultural attitudes:      Filipinos tend to be very group oriented compared to Americans who tend to be individualistic and who are often rewarded for their individualism.    Advantages of being mestizo raised in the U.S. = I feel hella tall when in the mall.    Stop signs do not exist in the Philippines. They are a figment of your imagination.    Went to the Center for Kampampangan Studies at Holy Angel University in Angeles City. The Kampampangans have a rich background that dating back a few thousand years. I have the book, you can read it if you want. ;)

      Grabe! Another slow day for me. Spent most of my day entering in my field notes and checking email.     Cost of living here is pretty cheap. A litter of Coke in the U.S. costs about PHP 110 ($2 US) while here in Barangay Maruglo it's PHP 19 ($0.035 US).  Almost finished the  Da Vinci Code . That's a really good book! If all the facts in the book are correct, it has some very important implications on religious belief and thought.    Okay, so I'll write up some haikus tomorrow when I get to the NGO.    Houses here for a 4-bedroom 2 bath house in Angeles City in a nice barangay or sub-division is about PHP 3 million (~ $60,000 US). Time to start saving up and getting that dual citizenship!

      I'm creating a seperate blog for field notes. It'll be all jumbled (is that a word!?) so you'll (ie. the reader) have to sort through it which is fine with me since my brilliance is not so easily defined (LOL!).  Oh yeah, this Friday 7/16 is the art exhibit, not today 7/15.  Ingat!  John

      On the way back from Sitio Calapi we stopped by an art gallery that belonged to a friend of Arnel's and is located down the street from the Holy Rosary church in Angeles City. I spoke with the curator and one of the artists at length and discussed the visual arts program he is running. We had a few beers and we discussed Filipino politics and discussed my views about what being Filipino is about from a FilAm point of view (ie. the fractured culture, resilient culture, and search for cultural identity being difficult when Filipinos in the Philippines can't define it themselves). It was very entertaining to say the least.   I mentioned the importance of art and applauded them on their effort since for me, art is a tool and/or method for describing issues of social justice such as identification, feelings, and possibly answers. People tend to be visual and like the saying goes, 'a picture paints a thousand words.' So I'm very excited to see the exhibit on 7/15 particularly since the art will be by local Kampapangan artists. Also included in the exhibit will be music and poetry reading by local artists and of course food will be served (what Filipino celebration would be complete without food!?). I was even asked to participate by including my own artwork. I scoffed at the idea since I'm not really an artis (Mylene is the artista, not me, I wish she could go, she would have enjoyed this immensely!). Anyways, I promised to write some haiku's on Filipino life and scenes so let's see how that turns out. I'll post the haiku's at a later date.

      Okay so I'm gonna change around the format naman so it's easier to read. Anyways, this next entry is about the b-day extravaganza I had in Angeles City...  Well the beginning of the day was mostly uneventful as I spent most of the time transcribing my journal into blog-format. However from 10:00 AM till 3:00 AM the next day (7/14) my day was filled with birthday wishes, cakes, and of course food, food, and yes, more food (so much for losing wait in the Philippines!).  I learned in order to have a long life, you need to eat pancit which is important to me since I plan to be immortal. Also went to church on my b-day which I also found out is part of Filipino tradition. There wasn't many people in church which was ok (just myself as my guide had dropped me off and a few dozen other people so I took the time to pray and self-reflect and to conduct some pre-Pennance).  Well, suffice to say the night was filled with San Miguel and Red Horse as well as several different kinds of Pampangan appetizers. Every bar we went to (well, only 2 really), an amateur Filipino kareoke singer was present at one point or another which was cool. The first club was okay and reminded me of Asia SF (the tranvestite night club/show in SF) and the second was a bar called R&B located outside Clark Airbase (I liked this one more because the live bands were really good and because there was actual space to dance around, plus the female singers were really cute). ANYWAYS, was a great time, so what did I learn:  1) Comedy: Filipinos love to laugh (even if it's at my expense!).  2) Singing: Filipinos love to sing (even if it's really bad since for some being the center of attention makes up for it).

      Here are some supplemenatl journal entries. Unfortunately I don't have a specific date for these entries. Some are serious and some are tongue-in-cheek... Anyways, enjoy!  So I learned some useful phrases:  May nobyo na ba kayo? Pwede ba kitang halikan? LOL! I'm going to get in trouble I think! ;)  Why the Aetas distrust people wearing military clothes:  I can understand now why the Aetas feel uncomfortable around the military because during the Marcos regime, many Aeta tribal leaders simply 'disappeared.' Also, three-way skirmishes between the Philippine Army, the Prolitariat Revolutionary Army, and of course the New People's Army with the Aeta caught in the middle (innocent by-standers to be sure that are caught in the crossfire). I was told back in March, 100 NPA patrolled by the village where I will be going. Although the NPA didn't cause any trouble, they were asked to leave by the village chief and the NPA agreed to. Two days later the military was in force in the area searching for the NPA. Two days after that, the military and NPA forces fought. The outcome; 20 dead (5 of them innocent civilians). Also the Aeta are constantly raided with their weapons being taken away. These rifles that are confiscated are used for hunting which leaves them very little in terms of tools that can be used to feed their families with.  So here's a concise list of hostilities in the region:  Bandits NPA PRA Military  I'll add some 'psychological information' on the Aetas later...

       7/10/04 "What it comes down to..."  (Choice as a tool for empowerment and increasing one's sense of quality of life.)  What it comes down to is a matter of choice, wether you have it or not, wether the options are good or bad...  - Do I stay purely Filipino or adapt and mix it up?  Somewtimes we don't have those options and we're forced into a path we can't escape...  - Convert or die?  - Steal or starve?  When we're allowed a choice then we become empowered because we become directly involved in the decision making process. We no longer feel trapped because we have a choice, because we have control.  And it is this aspect of control in our lives that improves our opportunity and perceptions of our sense of 'quality of life.'   7/11/04 "Back to Angeles City..."  (Just some quick thoughts on the trip back.)  So I just remembered this, but why the heck is it important for Filipinos to learn English so that U.S. companies will feel comfortable coming to the Philippines? I'm sure I'm reading too much into this (the conspiracy theory nut that I am) when the assistant U.S. Amabassador gave a speech about how the U.S. hopes Filipinos keep learning how to speak English so U.S. companies will interested in working with the Filipinos (LOL, what type of corporate imperial dogma is that?). Anyways, found it ironic since I'm trying to learn about Filipino cultural identity and heritage and none of the speakers talked about that and mentioned that Filipinos should learn English.  Some quick addendums: * There is actually a location in BRGY. Maruglo for cell phone service. It's located near the front entrance, just before you get to the water buffalo.  * Bummed that Secretary Dinky is no longer the Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare (she had to resign in order for the Vice-President of the Philippines to take that position ~ something about the position being traditionally held by the V-P). So much for having someone qualified for the position and instead being replaced by political nepotism.  The ride back was uneventful...  1) Stopped by a 4x4 competition which seemed odd since I usually view that as a very 'red neck' thing and very American...  2) Stopped by Nepo Mall. Again, Filipinos love their malls, gives them a chance to socialize and this (like the ones in Makati) was packed.  3) I get asked two questions over and over... Am I single and am I married? LOL! ;)  7/12/04 "The situation in Sitio Calapi..." (Very depressing situation here, tons of environmental issues, where's Ruby when I need her, this is her field of expertise...) ;)  Very depressed village with numerous public health dilemnas. Most problems are enviromenentally related due to internal and external factors:  1) Located near Clark Airbase (BRGY. Marcos Village), a source of a lot of air pollution from jets as well as the former U.S. military presence,  2) Waste management of both human feces/urine as well as standard garbage (tin, plastic, etc...) and not having a centralized location and as a result, the waste being spread all over the place,  3) Questionable water sources such that the deep water well's water integrity has been compromised by a possibly contaminated stream and that the current water source is a sediment filled stream higher up the mountain,  3) Increasing respiratory problems in the form of asthma from 3 known sources; a) air pollution from Clark Airbase, b) air pollution from burning refuse in the village, and c) prevalent smoking of adults among youth and infants.  Education is also a matter that's needs to be addressed as the educational committment at Sitio Calapi has been dwindling over time with the parents of the children complaining that their children aren't learning anything (the teachers are there intermittently and then only for a few hours). Currently the school supports up to grade 4 education.

      Hi all,  Well, hmmm... Sorry for the delay in sharing my exploits but my connection to internet has been intermittent until recently. Unfortunately this means that this first blog posting will be huge (naman!) and will be in digest format (actually most of them will be in digest format!).  In regards to specific NGO notes (collected scientific data and observations on target communities and populations in regards to strengths and limitations, assessments on current health status and suggested methods for interventions) those notes may be placed on a separate BLOG since I'm trying to keep that log specifically for that reason and as of now has become quite filled with notes on the plight of indigenous Filipinos.  The format is 'date' and then 'title' followed by a brief description when applicable and then the meat of the story. So without further adieu, here's the scoop...   7/5/04 "A Night Out..."  (This was actually a writing assignment so I wrote about our first night out on the town in Makati and it was storming outside as I wrote this thus the symbolism...)  The first thing I noticed was the smell, or more exactly the scent. The scent was like the beginning of a monsoon; thunder rolling in the background, the crescendo of noice increasing as she approached, the air thick and heady and difficult to breathe like tropical humidity. I found myself gasping...  Lightning flashed as she passed by. I could feel the electricity from her body. A carona of energy so brilliant and mystifying, so dangerous and unpredictable, yet I was unable to move, transfixed by her subtle movements, the she walked, the curves of her body...  Lightning flashed again as she turned my way, her dark sable eyes revealing a spirit that was intense yet at the same time soothing, eyes that could burn away your soul or lift you t places never dreamed of...  I was frozen in place. There was no chance of leaving even if I wanted to. A downpour was starting that would either cleanse my soul or sweep me away...   7/8/04 "Musings..."  (This is an attempt for me to consolidate the Filipino courses we had in Makati)  Much has happened over the past few days since our initial Philippine culture and identity classes started and only a day since it's end on 7/7/04.  I think I have a basic understanding about Filipino culture that can be described with two definitions:  1) Fractured Culture: Simply, because there is no set cultural identity. How Can Filipino-Americans (FilAms) look for their cultural identity when Filipinos (living in the Philippines) themselves can't define what it is to be Filipino.  2) Cultural Resiliency: The Filipino(a) is a resilient person, capable of incredible things simply because of his or her determination to do so and with the attitude of  BAHALA NA  (not in the fatalistic sense of what ever happens happens, but in the sense of being able to overcome obstacles).  I think for most Filipinos (and for FilAms as well), we need to understand and accept one another. Filipinos are Filipinos not matter what part of the Philippines they are from. We are all  KABABAYANS  despite our regional differences.  In synthesis, Filipinos are  HALO-HALO .  Okay, machismo-time (or MACHO as the pinoys call it). There are some really cute women in both the Foundations and Fellows. Okay, there I said it and now I can go to bed... ;)  Some quick notes on the AWECA Foundation: AWECA is pretty massive in that it is a comglomerate of several companies owned by the same family that produce raw materials, own production facilities, as well as shipping facilities) and provides over 3,000 jobs to people in Angeles City. It is also important to note that AWECA is very community oriented and believes in community self-empowerment and and increasing social capital.  Tomorrow we head to Barangay Maruglo in Tarlac to meet with Aetan tribal leaders therefor I shall let Sleep's sweet emrbace envelope me... (I'm inspired by Rizal's poetic nature!!!). ;)   7/9/04 "Early morning relfections..."  (Well, sleep was short so I decided to read my Anels and Demons book by Dan Brown and ended up finishing the book which got me to thinking...)  3:00AM - How can God be omnipotent and benevolent if He loves us and knows all, wouldn't He protect us?  God does love us and does protect us in one way or another, however He allows us to make our own decisions.  These decisions although painful are how we learn about life. It's a part of growing up and in a sense, is how we protect ourselves.   7/9/04 "The trip to Barangay Maruglo..."  (Not much here, just a descrption of the trip to Barangay Maruglo, located in Capas, Tarlac. Of special note is that BRGY. Maruglo is the last 'civilied' settlement before the 3-4 hour hike to the sitios where the Aeta live.)   There was some major concern about the way I dressed this morning. I was looking forward to wearing my fatigues from the military because I had specifically brought them for the sole purpose of 'getting dirty.'  My host NGO was shocked by my attire and requested strongly that I change since I would stand out with them. I find that ironic since I stand out no matter where I go in the Philippines. Also, this brings about why the Aetas would react so poorly if I had worn my fatigues. Perhaps they were abused by the military here?  Anyways, I can see my other options as explained by the NGO also, such that civilians normally don't wear fatigues so the military would be wondering why I was wearing them. I suppose in this case discretion is the better part of valor and I should place my pride to the side...  Well, the trip to BRGY. Maruglo was pretty uneventful. The scenery was nice in the distance however driving through the various barangays I could see how economically depressed the area was. Never the less there was a hustle and bustle of Filipino life, carefree as ever.  By the way, Anajay at Ayala Foundation was so true, Filipino drivers are insane... ;)  Later in the day, I met a few tribal leaders and was told I would meet more tomorrow to discuss the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) in regards to their livelihood microloan they are receiving which is PHP 27,000.00 each (3 sitios).  ... Bummer, no cell signal in Barangay Maruglo...  Well, I knew I was in the Philippines when someone asked if I needed a  TABO  for the  COMFORT ROOM  (CR) and I knew I was in the province when we started eating all our meals with our  KAMAY . ;)

      Well, not really, it's good to be back around familiar surroundings. The temperature is a mild 66 degrees F. I would have thought I'd find it hella cold here but with all the air-con going on in the Philippines, it all seems the same. :P  Anyways, it was nice to see my co-workers. They were all asking me about my trip and I think I told the story to each person separately. :( My voice is hoarse so I wish they would have asked me all at once in the same room.  So, I talked with the gf last night. And we both agreed a relationship is about committment and self-sacrifice. I told her I would travel to Georgia if she got accepted there and she agreed she would go to the Philippines if I got accepted to a doctoral program in public health. I really hate Georgia, so I hope she knows how much I'm sacrificing here. As fo her going to the Philippines, would she really stay with me if she knew I'd be there for maybe 5 years studying?  Uggh. Long distance relationships really suck... Been there done that didn't like it... Now I'm back in one. Boohoo!  Anyways, uploading pics of the trip from the digital camera. The 35mm shots won't be on Snapfish for a week or so... If you're interested, let me know...  Ok, off to play some video games and lounge (I'm sore from working out at the gym). :(

      Wow, I even have them here...  Anyways, my house is thrashed. Fore the record my roommate is a slob. He's a cool guy, but damn he's a slob. Spent most of my time so far doing my own laundry and cleaning the common areas of the house. Not that I'm a neat freak or anything, I just believe in being tidy and organized (which is ironic since my room is a mess, which is okay with me since it's, hopefully, not a common area in the house).  Finally talked with Karen my gf. We both miss each other and that's good. I haven't spoken with her for almost 2-months and have text'ed each other a few times during my absence. Anyways, she mentioned that she was going to apply to the CDC (no not the Clark Development Committee for those Kampampangas but the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia... Or HOT-lanta depending if y'alls is from da dirty south... which I agree sometimes with that it's all about chicken and beer... sarup!).  Anyways, if she gets the position, it's another 2-years apart from each other (3 total). LOL! Oh man. I sure know how to pick relationships. Anyways, I brought up that maybe we should seprate since I don't really mind long distance relationships but it seems our paths are going in different directions... Her's to the east coast and mine to the Pacific.  I'm not the kind of person that would be selfish and tell her for my sake not to follow her dreams, it's important that she does this because this is what she wants to do. I've always supported her and her goals, so hoepfully she'll support mine and my interests of returning to the Philippines and helping the people and country there... (I'm considering pursuing my doctoral program there...)  Ah well... I told her we'd talk more about it later... I hate breaking up, it's not fun... :P

      Wow, back home. Leaving the Philippines I felt that same melacholy 'homesick' feeling when I moved from Hawaii back to California. What I miss most about the Philippines are the friendships I've made and the ambience of simply being in the Philippines. *sigh* And all that food... Well at least I didn't eat any balut although to be a polite guest I ate some bitter melon... :P  Hmmm... Well Nikki and I had a good flight back. We were separatedwhen the flight began because of the seating arrangements but we talked to a few of the people who were sitting in the same row as us and asked them if they would be interested in switching seats so we managed to sit together for the whole flight back which I enjoyed and made the trip more bearable having one of my kapatid with me.  One question that came up was when we both knew we were Filipino. For me it happened when I was in grade school (maybe 2nd grade). As most everyone who knows me knows I don't really look Filipino. I'm mestizo but I could really pass for a full-blooded latino. Anyways, when I was in grade school, one of the teachers volunteered me to dance some Mexican fiesta dances. I had told her that 'ma'am, I'm not Mexican I'm Filipino.'  She simply replied, 'don't worry you look Mexican to me.'  My earliest memory was when I was 2 years old and ironically was of me leaving the Philippines. I thought about this same memory when I was leaving the Philippines this time around. Anyways, I remember sitting and that the chair tray was down and my mom had poured some plastic toys on the tray for me to play with during the flight.

      I can't believe it! The volcano was barely visible because of the mist and the rain (boohoo!). :P It appears that my volcano viewing bad luck has followed me to the Philippines from Costa Rica where the exact same thing happened.  The only site (or is that sight as in for sore eyes) worth seeing was Mylene's buddy. :) Well, Mylene was worth seeing too but she's my kapatid and I hadn't seen her in a while, LOL!). The director of NKTI was quite hillarious and quite the character to boot. What a very socially responsible person he is. It was a pleasure to meet Mylene's host NGO and her buddy. :)  So in regards to the volcano pics, you'll just have to imagine what it was like. As Gura said to me, 'a volcano on a lake on an island on an ocean...' or something to that effect... ;)  Oh yeah, so about this 'no romance' policy, I figure I can get around it by saying 'this kiss' or 'this hug' or what ever, 'means abosultely nothing to me as I have no romantic intentions towards you...' I'm not sure if this will work since I have a feeling it'll cause more pain (as in physical) than pleasure and I'm too nervous to try. ;)

      Just some catching up here on things I may have missed over the past week...  Over the weekend (Saturday) I had the opportunity to go to a massage parlor. I know what you're thinking (bastos!) but just because the massage parlor is in Angeles City (know for its prostitution) it was clean and wholesome fun and was conducted at Indulgence Spa which actually is a spa and the staff was is very professional there.  The next day I went to the Robinson Mall which located next to the SM Mall. The malls are the same size as the ones in the U.S. but have about 3 times as many consumers. Didn't buy much, just some CK1 and some souvenirs and ended seeing a movie (I-Robot) since there was a typhoon outside. Don't worry Jeff and Shak, I'm still looking for a life-sized barrel man for y'all but you'll have to watchout because that boner will knock you out (mama said knock you out!).  The next couple of days were typical office days.  However I did get the chance to have dinner and visit the Red Light district with my classmate Ruby Asuncion Turalba (she's like the Lara Croft of environmental activism except shorter) and Christina Leano (saavy and sultry executive director for Ayala Foundation, USA). Both young women along with their entourage of eco-crusaders were charming companyto say the least. I think what caught me off guard was a) the Red Horse Stallion, and b) the non-accented English. However, I have to thank my host NGO and host family for putting up with my accented Tagalog (or lack there of) and having the patience to speak with me in the first place... ;)  On Thursday I went down to Manila to visit an NGO called the Shinning Light Foundation (the title reminds me of the Shinning Path guerillas that were once lead by Che Guevara or maybe the Shinning...). This NGO is a religious (Born-Again) organization that concentrates mainly on helping other Born-Again organizations and individuals, missionaries, etc. and had graciously sponsored the AWECA Foundation's scholarship program (SLF sponsors 3 high school and 1 college student out of the total 100 scholars that AWECA coordinates) since SLF and AWECA have the similar goals of education and religion as part of their service to their community. Anyways, the SLF executive director is very fiesty and not your typical pinay (she contributes this behavior to her living in Chicago for 1-year, which I'm sure would make anyone edgy). All in all it was a good experience and I learned a great deal, for example, that being open (for example one's religious views) is paramount to form lasting and positive partnerships. In the U.S. I don't work so much with religious organizations because I want to maintain a non-partisan view that religion can sometimes bias. When I do consider a religious partner, it's important to consider several religious partners so non-bias can be maintained.  Well, I'll probably have another update on Monday. This weekend we're supposed to have a staff retreat on Saturday and on Sunday it's off to the Taal Volcano.

      What is at stake in the Philippines when we become involved in the communities that we have been participating in?  Social justice, human dignity, quality of life, empowerment, opportunity.  All these terms are so connected and intertwined. It seems like you can't have one without the other.  But how can these discrepancies be acknowledged when those with so little in all these qualities are ignored? How can they be given voices so that they become acknowledged?  It's heartening to see indivuals and organizations who have not given up on their kabayans, their kapatid, to lend them the strength of their voices, of their spirit, so that our brothers and sisters who are lacking are heard and recognized.  Much has to be done until we are all equal, until we all share the same human dignity, till we are all empowered and have the opportunities as human beings. It's hard to start the walk towards freedom when the end of the road is so far off but the journey must be started even with just a simple footstep forward.  Sometimes when I feel overwhelmed, it helps to read the quotes of Cesar Chavez. His words are so honest and simple, yet so strong and dignified that you can't help but feel inspired to carry on.

      Education overcomes poverty.  Education provides opportunity.  Education enables empowerment.  Education increases quality of life.  But what happens when even the basic necessities needed for education are unavailable? What happens when resources are so limited that rarely do children have the opportunity to attend school?  In the Philippines, poverty plays a major role in the opportunity for students to attend school. Those families who can afford to spend the PHP 15,000 or so pesos to send their children to school (public or private) will do so. However, many families can not. And because of this, many children grow up with limited opportunities of breaking the chains of poverty that restrict them, forcing them to repeat the same circle of poverty, generation after generation after generation.  In the Lord of the Rings,  J.R. Tolkien has a line...  One ring to rule them, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them, And in the darkness, bind them.  One could think of the One Ring as poverty when applied to each verse...
