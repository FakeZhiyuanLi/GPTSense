      i think its kinda ironic how when you call someone to thank them for something they did and they turn around and slap you in the face to remind you that you're still wrong. I actually kinda felt like i was crawling back to you and asking for forgivness when i called to thank you, but after i hung up the phone you only made me more proud of  "the oh so horrible thing saturday night brought." --so you say. But you make me feel like THE most disgusting person in the world when you talk to me about this, like i couldnt have done anything worse. I felt bad for doing it just because i knew i let you down, but since 10 minutes ago im proud as hell and i wish i coulda done what we did in your face. you said you want me to feel remorse.. well sweety im 14 years old and i pretty much asked for what he gave me so that pretty much screws any chances of me feeling remorse. The only thing i wish wouldnt have happend is getting caught. and one last thing, you dont want me to tell anyone cause YOU'LL feel embarassed, well just for that if i could, id scream it to the world.    dad came in my room @ 4.. saw that i wasnt sleeping, he asked why. i just said i wasnt tired. he kissed me goodbye and left to get on a plane to houston. A.M HOMEROOM: didnt really stay in there we had an assembly ASSEMBLY: 2 hours, stu. co. induction and junior ring tying 1-3: Science Lab- I GOT IN MY FIRST FIGHT AT BLENK!! :o) YAY! not gonna tell the whole story but just to let you know me and jess came out on top w/props from the entire class!!  4-6: Spanish- board work 7-9: PE- badmitton.. we lost twice oh well i didnt really care its just pe anyways 10-12: History- took a test, made a 100 on it. and then talked 13-14: Lunch- just talked about ppl we used to know. it got really sad... 15-17: English- went over a study guide 18-20: skipped, lisa picked me up early.  so here i am at the moment, today was a day that felt like i still had you. but i dont see any progression. but thats just me.. who knows. im gonna go pack cause im leaving for houston tomorrow.   i love you sonny.

      woke up 5 minutes late.. searched my room and all of downstairs for my skirt, couldnt find it..  found it, put it on. brushed my teeth, ate oreo o's and teared up while doing it cause i know you love oreos. took my medicine and left 10 minutes late.  A.M HOMEROOM- channel one ..i fell asleep 1-3: Health- we did a skit, they thought it was cute, i hated it. i was the "ticket lady" ..how lame 4-6: Science- Notes, wrote sonny a letter which was pointless cause its soaked w/tears now.  7-8: Religion- forgot my book so i just sat there and thought 9: ate an early lunch w/cassie.. we talked about her stalker boyfriend that shows up at her house at 8 at night and i told her id rather have a stalker boyfriend who shows up at my house at 8 at night then have no boyfriend at all.  10-12: Algebra- quiz, worksheet? ..i dun really remember 13-14: Lunch- i didnt eat cause i ate at 9 but i got an icecream and we all thot of things to name robs dog.. and then i went into this like.. "out of it" mood where ppl tried to talk to me and i just stared at them and didnt say anything. 15-16: English Lab- spelling bee i won 2nd place.. mis-spelled the word calendar.. i spelled it er instead of ar.  17: i was off but i just stayed in my eng. class w/some ppl and my teacher asked what i wanted to be when i got older.. i told her psychologist and she said that she thinks that id make a very good psychologist.. that made me a lil happy... then this girl told me i looked like a dancer.. that made me really happy for all of 5 minutes then i went back into my depressiveness.. 18-20:Spanish- worksheet   you know how if someone hits you really hard your reflex is to say 'ouch'. well every single time your name suddenly popped into my head my reflex was 3 words followed along behind it and if i keep saying these 3 words it will either send me even deeper into depression or do as you say and "move on." incase you're wondering what those 3 words were they are 'he's not mine.' and i dont think that they were of much help today bc everytime the reflex happend i wanted to crawl into a cold corner and cry for a lifetime. one of the things that scares me is that you'll talk to one of your certain friends and take his advice, which will make you change your views and then i would have truly lost all of you and by the looks of last night i think hes been lecturing you on what to do. No matter what direction life takes you and no matter whats thrown at you i'm still goin to be here for you. i miss you so incredibly much than i ever have and i think its because i know those words "HES NOT MINE" are true and i dont want to face that bc its way to soon. i love you so much. and that will   never    change.

      words of advice..  if you dont know someone like your brother or sister.. DONT TRUST THEM. they'll only screw you over in the end and make things worse then they already are. i figured since i confided in this person so many other times before, and since shes confided in me i could trust her. but i guess i was wrong and i really feel like shes stabbed me in the back even when i asked her please not to tell a specific person what i had told her. Its amazing what some people will do. I dont know why you did it, cause she already knew but you made it 10times worse bc now she knows what has happend almost a year ago, those "incidents" belong in the past.. so KEEP THEM THERE. Theres no use in digging up old dirt when im putting a pile of FRESH NEW DIRT in my garden. I dont hate you but i most certainly WILL NOT run to you with another problem thinkin you'll keep it to ureself.   -anyways ...about my day-  woke up.. put my uniform on, went to the bathroom, absent mindedly put my toothbrush in my mouth and started to brush... i broke down, couldnt stand the sound of it anymore when all i used to do was laugh everytime i brushed my teeth.... (only you will know why)  went to my locker ..got my books went to the library, wrote sonny a letter.. cried A.M HOMEROOM:: told jess the whole story.. cried again 1-6: OFF- me and jess and z talked about sonny the whole time, i tried to study but my mind was filled with old inside jokes and memories of him i couldnt shake. 7-9: PE- spirit ball, i didnt participate. but what else is new 10-12: HISTORY- study guide 13-14: LUNCH- didnt eat.. i kinda just stared and picked at it.. then we went outside w/jess and nate and brie and cassie and me and rob listened to 'concrete angel' and 'shes my kinda rain' ...and i cried again 15-17: ENGLISH- cried 18-20: Algebra- worksheet  got in the truck w/dad, found out he knows more about my "experiences"  did homework went to the store.. even though my world is upside down.. walmart shoppers havent changed a bit, they're still evil and they show NO MERCY on the broken hearted now im here, thinkin about what i had. i miss you baby, and you'll always be the one that got away, im sorry for everything, if i ever hurt you, or made you worry about what i was doing, or even questioning your trust for me, im sorry for it all i just want you to know that i'll always love you and you'll always be my first love, no one can change what you mean to me, no distance, no words, and no amount of pain. i love you baby. December 11th- April 24th, you gave me the best 4 months and 2 weeks of my life.

       -SATURDAY-   god i dont know where to start..  you know whats kinda crazy? when you love somebody, like, REALLY love somebody and they love you back you get a feeling or like a sense that you're inseperable. Like nothing can come between you and youd strive to be with each other and sacrifice more than half of your time dedicating it to the person that you're in love with. Nothing in the world could have torn you apart. Its funny how you think something that feels so good can tear you to pieces, rip your heart out and spit on it like it was nothing to begin with. Never in a million years did i ever think we'd end this way. The relationship didnt even die by its own hand and THAT is whats going to keep me holding on. The fact that  I  didnt do anything to you and  YOU  didnt do anything to me. But theres no one to blame for our seperation but ourselves. As much as im hating to say this, they're only doing it because they care. And i know you hate them but you have to try and understand that they only want me to be ok. Im not proud of what we did anymore and i see so much more wrong with it then right. As much as i loved it, it WAS wrong. Im so sorry that it ends this way. Im so sorry that it ends.. and baby i know, every tear i cry you'll feel and everytime i lay out at night and talk to the stars, you'll hear me, and everytime i say i love you, you'll feel it. I just wish that there was a way around this but sweety there's not. i'll say what i've said all along. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU, ALWAYS. and i'll ALWAYS CARE FOR YOU AS I DO NOW. They'll seperate us baby, but they cant make me not love you. I'll never EVER forget you, the way you made me feel, the things you've done for me, or how much i love you. Baby you're one in a god damn million, you're perfect and i wouldnt have you any other way. But they're making me let go and theres not a thing i can do about it. I love you so much and i never wanted to have to say this, bye...    From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem Of our dying day  For a second I wish the tide Would swallow every inch of this city As you gasp for air tonight I'd scream this song right in your face If you were here I swear I won't miss a beat Cause I never Never have before

      i didn't think anything intresting would happend, but i lied. but nothing intresting DID happen im just extremely bored and im gonna keep writing until i get out what i need to get out what im hating, and missing.   i hate the way my brain tells me that im ok but my heart breaks everytime i think about you. i hate the way that i tell everyone im ok but its only a lie cause im really not ok. Is it my fault that i dont like open discussions about whats bothering me? *shrugs* oh well. i miss last summer and everything that happend and everything that should've happend that didn't. It bothers me to flirt with people who i cant stand but do it anyways cause im dumb. I miss the way you used to look at me and push back my hair when it was in my eyes and tell me you love me and kiss me on my forehead and it made me feel like a princess. I really hate how everyone is leaving and i feel like im never going to see anyone of my friends ever again. I miss not wondering what i was goin to do on a weekend because i knew one of my friends was goin to come kidnap me and we'd go do something and i wouldnt have to worry about what i said and if i said something and sounded stupid. I missed when i could get together with everyone in one place and just laugh my ass off at stupid little things like matt and renny and stephen makin fun of me tahj mahal *winks*.  and i just miss my old life where everything made sense.

      mk, yeah my DAY since i know you're waiting on baited breath to hear about it...  we didnt really have school today.. well we had SCHOOL but it was freshman retreat so heres how it went  got to school and kinda just sat around and talked until ppl until they all called us into the cafe to "check roll" and eat donuts. yummy, but i didnt have any cause i already had breakfeast.   then we went in the gym and sat together and mrs.linda talked  then we got in groups of 10 and blew balloons up, got in a straight line and put them in between our stomach and the person in front of us's back and then we had to walk forward, hop on one foot and pick up a pen. it was fun. OUR GROUP DIDNT DROP ANY BALLOONS!! YAY!!  then we layed down on our backs in a line head to head w/our arms in the air and then they put a girl on top of our hands and we had to get her to the end of the line w/using just our hands.  then these girls told us really sad stories about gettin pregnant, their abusive boyfriends, parents and guys and stuff that girls talk about.   then we broke up into small groups and "talked" --not really.  then we went back in and ATE PIZZA! it wasnt dominoes or anything but it was ok i guess. then we had these "magic card" thingys where you write someone a nice note and put it in their envelope on the wall. so we all wrote ea. other nice notes and put them in ea. others envelopes  then we listened to more girls talk about parents, guys, and stuff like that. and then we MEDITATED!!! and we had SOMEONE who kept stinking up our lil area i swear it stunk SOOO bad. but then the smell went away and we layed back down and meditated more. then we were dismissed so we went and got our "magic cards". and me and michele and julie and gwen and lexi and about 7 other ppl went outside to wait for our rides and read our magic cards! YAY! i got alot, i didnt know that many ppl liked me they made me happy.   :o)  now im here bout to take out all my pictures and put them up and be decorative for my last 2 weeks here. im excited about the move but i just found ppl that i like hangin with and its gonna be sad to leave them cause they're really sweet. even though i havent like known them all my life im gonna miss them alot. but yeah lets not get sad cause today must be a happy day cause i  FINALLY  have plans to do something tonite! i think shrr is gonna be proud!!!

      well i DID NOT want to get up this morning. and ive learned that going to sleep earlier really helps out when you wake up. ..i unfortunately woke up this morning.. ..turned on my tv to mtv and mtv2 to watch videos..  ..washed my face.. ..went downstair to eat.. ..ate oreo o's.. YAY ..came back upstairs, got my schoolbag, id, and purse... then we left ..got to school and went in the office cause they announced yesterday there was a lost cell phone turned in and i didnt realize until this morning that missing cell phone was MINE. so i went to get it. then i saw kristen and told her bout my phone. she thot i said i lost my baby instead of phone.. phone, baby.. i dont hear how she coulda gotten that but OK.  ..me and kristen went to my locker and i got my books we talked then she left.. BELL RANG   A.M HOMEROOM: talked to ppl and ignored mr.a when he told me to shut up. 1-3: HEALTH- we talked about relationships and EVERYONE fell asleep.. but i didnt i like that class 4-6: SCIENCE- Tested all hour 7-9: RELIGION- Highlighted 10-12: ALGEBRA- quiz and went over homework 13-14: LUNCH- i got my salad, sat down, and left. i dont enjoy lunch anymore.  OK ...GOT OUTSIDE and my schoolbag was missing. and i knew who did it.. so i was like OK LETS BE A LIL IMMATURE AND TAKE MY SCHOOLBAG AND HIDE IT FROM ME. i mean.. are we still in 4th grade? didnt think so.   GROW UP.    and ACT YOUR AGE. its RIDICULOUS. 15-17: OFF. i went to the lib. to look stuff up then went back out in the breeze way.. GUESS WHAT WAS THERE.. *GASPS DRAMATICALLY AND PUTS HANDS TO CHEEKS* WHO COULD HAVE PUT MY SCHOOLBAG BACK? hmmmm..... so i inspected it ...nothing missing. these ppl are weird, if they're gonna steal a schoolbag but nothing out of it. but im sure they wouldve if there was something of value in there. but theres not. just letters to sonny. 18-20: SPANISH- dont remember PM HOMEROOM: talked to gwen and steph and melodie about the "DANCE". EEK! then me and steph started talken bout drivers ed.   socially, i KNOW im better i just need to take advantage of the oppourtunities that i've been given. bc i know that if i keep running down the road im on i'll get to a dead end then have to turn around and go back to where i started.. so im just gonna take a SMALL DETOUR on my "road" although im looking forward to my "detour" im excited about the "whole new road" i'll be running on in 3 weeks and 1 day.   that was my day.. it was pretty bad cause of the whole schoolbag thing but i just have to get over my astonishment of other ppls immaturity. then i'll be good.   love you sonny

      I WOKE UP HAPPY TODAY.. i think its cause i went to sleep like an hour and a half early.. i should try this more often...  went downstairs and ate breakfast w/dad.. WE SAW A RABBIT IN THE BACK YARD!  got dressed DADDY BROUGHT ME TO SCHOOL TODAY..  AM HOMEROOM- talked to ppl 1-3: Science Lab- worksheets.. my teacher got an attitude w/me.. i put her in her place tho.  4-6: Spanish- Read in our workbooks 7-9: PE- badmitton and talked to ppl 10-12: History- movie 13-14: lunch ...wasnt really hungry so i went outsided and did my homework.. alone. *TEARS*. and i missed ..him @ lunch so i was sad 15-17: English- quiz 18-20: algebra- bookwork   got home.. did homework. KIRBIE CALLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YAYAYAYAYAY! we talked for EVER! and i LOVED IT!!!!!!!! god i miss her SOOOOOOOO DAMN MUCH. then did algebra and NICK CALLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EEEEEEEk!!!!!!!! we didnt talk forever but i still loved it!!! I MISS HIM TO MUCH!!!  then algebra.. no one called this time and thats the only reason i finished it.   now... im here... and heres what ON MY MIND..  i learned its easier not to care. but just because i  SAY  i dont care doesnt  MEAN  i dont care and you of all people should know that what i say isnt always what im feeeling. not that i've told you that i dont care, not that ive had the CHANCE to. i dont think about it as much.. it being us. but wondering how you are and what you're doing is ALWAYS in the back of my thoughts even when you're the farthest from the front of my thoughts as can be. I always told you that you didnt know how much i loved you. Now when i think about when i used to say that, i know i didnt realize THEN how much i REALLY DID LOVE YOU and how much i still do. I dont want to need you anymore because i cant. I dont wanna try anymore im so tired of it. The sad thing being i dont even know what im trying to do, or fix, or want. I guess i should just avoid the situtation of seeing i have an oppourtunity to talk to you and i've been doing a good job of it lately but it hurts and i havent cried or thought about you in  DAYS but i dont know why today is different. It just felt so right and thats what i cant let go of. I was wrong when i said that since we werent together i still didnt want us to say bye. We have to walk out or it'll never heal. bye... i love you

THURSDAY. -school -changed after school and i never realized how much ppl will stare at you if ure not wearing your uniform, not that it mattered cause everyone told me i looked cute anyways. -airport -PLAAANE -airport -HOTEL -out to eat  that was thurs. in a nutshell  --FRIDAY-- woke up early and went to the "LOBBY" to eat breakfast.. VERY NICE.  got dressed to go meet the realters at their office we got there and dad signed some papers then we went HOUSE HUNTING HOUSE 1:: not very cute.. wasnt big AT ALL HOUSE 2:: OMG had THE CUTEST DOG. it was a big house and it was reaaaalllly nice but it was like 17 years old so my dad was kinda iffy on it but it was REALLY nice so we liked it HOUSE 3:: i dun remember this house HOUSE 4:: we liked it but it was kinda not what we were looking for HOUSE 5:: MEXXXXICAN dude lived there. we didnt like the house. HOUSE 6:: *MOUTH DROPS* WOOOOW... HUGE. i fell in love. but the room that i would have didnt have a door on it so.. yeah we'd have to put one HOUSE 7:: after house 6 there was just no competition. they were kinda the same though.   after this we went back to the hotel, talked about which ones we liked and kinda chilled until like 7 then went to eat at this seafood place it was good, nice atmosphere. i had a PINA COLADA!! mmm gotta love those.  --SATURDAY--  we went back to the realters office.. iT WAS POURRRRING RAINING AND FREEZING COLD. we decided to make an offer on house 6 but wanted to take one last look at it. so we went back to the house, looked and then went back to their office. made an offer on the house and dad and lisa signed papers like ALL morning while i played black jack on my phone. which cheated btw. the realters took us out to lunch we went back to the hotel and i took a 3 hour nap cause dad was on call w/"an imp. executive" or w/e then we went to look for a resturaunt.found one the wait was 20 min. and we were starving so we just left. then went to another one the wait was 90-100 min. so we left... it must've been prom cause i saw alot of girls and guys walken around in formals which saddend me. but we ended up at a chinese rest. which was the first chinese rest. i have been to that had mexican waiters and waitresses.  went to look at the house again ....got lost..... went back to the hotel, put on my bathing suit, and went and sat in the spa which was a really stupid thing to do bc ....yeah, it just was it made me cry. cause the STARS were out. and i talked to them. then i went in and watched snl and slept  --SUNDAY-- woke up at like 630 and went back to sleep then my dad came and jumped on me and i scared him away w/the "OH SO GREAT MORNING BREATH". hehe.  got dressed went to the lobby to eat/ i think old ppl have staring problems went back to the room to get our bags checked out went to the airport.. can you say CHAOS? mk dad and lisa LEFT ME at the security checkpoints cause they like... made me STRIP. i had to take off my belt.. turn my pockets inside out.. TAKE OFF MY SHIRT.. i just told them i had a metal wire in my bra.. cause im sure they woulda made me take that off if i wouldnt have said so. thank god i wore a tank top under my shirt. then since i think they thot i was a "suspect" they made me run my bags thru the laser thingy again. after that i called my dad, he didnt even realize i wasnt w/him. caught up w/them. got on the plane. sat staring out of the window for what seems like 2 hours and we havent even taken off. so i ask dad whats wrong.. he told me.. then i went back to listening to story of the year. FINALLY tOOK OFF.  i slept like, the whole way. got off car ride HOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMME   we're moving THE DAY i get outta school... like bell rings, get in car...
