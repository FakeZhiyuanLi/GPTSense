      as you probably know, i am in virginia beach at my grandparents' house.  anyway, we are driving back to ohio tomorrow, and we're leaving at 8 in the morning.  as it is about 10-11 hrs, i wont be able to post the hitter update in time for all of the games, so you will have to do without me.  this probably means you now have no chance whatsoever, but thats life i guess.  i might talk about the 7:05 and later games if i get home in time, probably not. have a good one regardless.

      happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the "evil ventilation system".  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my "out on a limb" pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!

      here is my 1st hitter update, for yesterdays games.  just one correction from yesterdays pitcher update: the mil/ana game went 17 not 15 innings.  ty to captainfurby for bringing that to my attention.  on w/ the hitter update.  enjoy!  e. renteria StL: 1-4 GS HR, 2 R, 4 BI, 1 BB.  Decent numbers on the yr, only 4 HR. 9 consecutive 1-hit games, .261 avg.  this seems to have been an anomaly.  He is probably the best SS in the NL, but the AL has much better options c. guillen Det: 3-4 HR, 2 R, 1 BI, SB.  Quietly having a very good year for the relatively speaking, rejuvenated tigers.  Batting .326 on the yr w/ 5 3B, 9 HR, 15 2B.  OBP is hovering around .400.  he strikes out a bit too much, but that has always been his case.  Easily his best yr as a pro m. tejada Bal: 2-4 HR, 3 BI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K.  broke out of a bit of a slump (2-14, 2 BI since 6/3) in a big way.  Has had a consistent yr for the o’s, batting .312 on the season.  He has established himself as one of the top SS in the league. b. abreu Phi: 2-4, 2 HR, 3 R, 3 BI, 1 BB, 1 K.  has had incredible last 5 games (8-18, 9 R, 7 BI, 6 BB, 3 K, 2 SB, 3 HR, 2 2B).  batting .299 w/ 14 HR on season, he has been very solid for the majority of the season.  I would pick him up now if you still can. Aaron rowand Chisox: 3-5 HR, 2B, 2 R, 3 BI, 1 K.  he has been the team’s 4th OF all season, but w/ maggs out for an expected 4-7 weeks, it is his chance to shine.  He got off to a great start yesterday.  If you are looking for a cheap player who will start, look no further. d. miller Oak: 2-4 GS HR, 4 BI, 2 R, 1 K.  on a 3-game tear (6-13, 2 HR, 12 BI-yes 12, 4 R, 4 2B).  batting .291 for the season.  He has not been especially good all year, and IMO is somewhat overpriced.  However, if he can keep this up, that will no longer be the case.  This recent tear may have some correlation to reds’ pitching however.  Wait a game or 2, this could be a fluke.  Other players that had notable games last night include: k. greene SD, t. hafner Cle, j. cruz TB, j. dye Oak (another very hot player), and a. dunn Cin (see last parenthetical statement).  There are some obscure players I have adopted as my favorites that I will update you on periodically.  Here are 2: k. youkilis Bos: mentioned profusely in Moneyball by Michael lewis (a fascinating book if youre into these things), his nickname is “the greek god of walks”.  He has had a productive rookie season, and last night was 1-3 with a walk.  Batting .286 w/ OBP of .400, look for great things next year and maybe even late this season from him so taguchi StL: 1-4 3B, 1 BB, 2 R last night.  He is also a rookie this yr, and is used primarily as a PH or PR.  Batting .258 on the season, he also has a 1.000 base stealing % (1-1).  He has shown improvement lately, and I think that he could start in a year or 2.  I follow him b/c I like his name. Its going to be the new phrase in StL soon.  People will be like “that was so taguchi”, meaning “that was so clutch”.  Mark these words, he will be big, baby!  That’s it for the hitter wrapup today.  Some games that should have good hitting numbers today are:  Col (j. Jennings) @ NYY (j. Contreras), Mil (w. obermuller) @ Ana (a. sele), and Phi (b. myers) @ ChW (s. schoeneweis).  The last one is just b/c the last 2 games in the series have been 13-11 and 14-10, not b/c of poor pitching.  Any comments you have are welcome.  Hope this is helpful.  Have a good one!

      last night saw quite a few outstanding performances by pitchers.  i will go over a few of them as well as give my thoughts on some pitching matchups today.  my family drove to my grandparents' house in virginia beach last night and today, so i will be there for the week.  the 11-hour drive wears on you a bit, but i am recovering now.  so here you are: last night: ben sheets Mil: he turned in the performance of the night and left w/ a ND.  9 innings of 1-hit scoreless ball, but the game went to 15 i believe.  no walks and 5 K as well.  he seems to have fully recovered from the dizziness that made him miss his last start pedro martinez Bos: a great outing in an inconsistent year, he got a W for 8 innings of scoreless 2-hit pitching.  walked 2 and 8 Ks as well. this is in stark contrast to last outing where he gave up 7 ER and 11 hits in 5 IP. i am of the opinion that his ship has been righted for this season (yes i am reversing field from yesterday, i can do that) zack greinke KC: got the win after 7 innings of scoreless 3-hit ball w/ 5 K and no walks. although pitching v. the expos didnt hurt his stats, he has quietly put together a solid year.  he is 1-1 in 4 starts, w/ an ERA of 1.73 over 26 innings (6.5 per start).  a good option for AL only leagues or if youre low on $.  3-1 K-BB ratio looks pretty good also. kelvim escobar Tor: if you want to talk about hot, heres your man.  last 2 outings, he has been 1-0 with 1 ER over 16 innings.  last night he got a ND after 8 innings of scoreless 4-hit ball, including 11 K. 4-2 on the season, 3.34 ERA, and 54-20 K-BB, another good AL-only pickup. he seems to be settling in as a starter after being a reliever 2 yrs ago. randy johnson Ari: big unit rebounded from an average performance last outing, notching a W on 1 run, 3 hits in 7 IP.  only 4 K, but he has been 5-0 beginning w/ the perfect game. 8-4, 2.75 on the season, and is averaging nearly 7 IP per start. other notable performances came from Roger Clemens (0 ER, 3 H, 6.2 IP, 6 BB, 7 K, W), Javier Vazquez (1 ER, 5 H, 7 IP, 0 BB, 6 K, W), Matt Clement (3 ER, 5 H, 8 IP, 1 BB, 9 K, W), as well as Jerome Williams and Ted Lilly. today's games: since i just now have gotten access to a computer, i already know what happened to mark prior today.  after a solid 1st outing, he struggled against st louis.  he went 3.2 innings and gave up 5 ER on 5 hits and 5 BB.  he struck out 1.  he threw 83 pitches, 49 for strikes.  edgar renteria hit a GS in the 4th to knock him out.  as i said yesterday, i would give him another start or 2 to make sure he has recovered (i have to emphasize it when i get something right). other pitchers to look for today would be: b. lawrence SD: although he is pitching against a solid boston lineup, the padres have given him plenty of run support.  last start was solid (1 ER, 5 H, 7.1 IP), and i would look for a performance slightly below that today (this is definitely a limb i am going out on, but he doesnt usually walk many) k. brown NYY: he has been concerned w/ hes control lately, but his walk numbers are very low (17 BB in 78.2 IP). his last start was mediocre, but he is 7-1 on the season.  i would look for another 7 IP, 3 ER and a win from him. j. schmidt SF: after 2 opening losses, 7-0 with a 1-hitter.  last 2 starts have been 2-0 with 14 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, 20 K, and 5 BB.  pitching at TB shouldnt bring him any problems. this is as close to a lock as you can get, i would think. e. milton Phi: another relative unknown i am fond of.  7-1, 3.78 season. last 2 starts, he is 2-0 w/ 14 IP, 2 ER, 8 H, 8 K, and 5 BB.  the white sox offense has been solid this yr, but maggs is out, so milton should have a good start and i believe he should get a W.  that is your wednesday pitcher update. tomorrow we will cover hitters.  feel free to post any feedback whatsoever.  i hope you can find this helpful and enjoyable. have a good one!

      this post is my take on who is "hot" and who is "cooling off", based on performance over the last week or so.  in the fantasy game i play, players' prices fluctuate pretty closely with their performance, however, some do not (eg Roger Clemens' plummeting (sp?) price).  this is therefore not a barometer of who will make more $, just who has been playing above or below what they have done this season.  that said, here are my picks and their stats last week:  HOT: hitters:  J. Estrada C Atlanta: 8/17, 4 runs, 4 RBI, 4 2B, 1 HR, 4 BB, 2K   injured lineup not hurting Estrada, he has had a career  season  S. Casey 1B Cincinnati: 6/22, 4 runs, 3 RBI, 1 2B, 2 HR, 3K   NL avg. leader on a roll along with his team  JD Drew OF Atlanta: 7/17, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 2 HR, 6 BB, 2 K, 1 SB   injury-free season shows how good he can really be  K. Griffey OF Cincinnati: 8/19, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 4 HR, 6 BB, 3 K   see JD Drew  J. Dye OF Oakland: 7/25, 6 runs, 6 RBI 3 HR, 3 BB, 7 K, 1 SB   trying to prove that hot hot start was no fluke pitchers:  C. Carpenter SP StL: 6/2 7 IP, W, 9 K, 7 H, 3 ER                       6/7 8.1 IP, W, 6 K, 9 H, 3ER   7-1, 3.42 on the season, next start 6/12 at Texas. Cards have   had good run support all season.  low ERA and walk ratios; too   many hits may come back to haunt him though.  Danny Graves RP Cin: blown save 6/5 can't discount 26 saves   already.  the 3.27 ERA for a closer is a bit frightening.   he has 3 games v. Cle this week, and should be good for a save   or 2 in that series  E. Milton SP Phi: 5/30 7 IP, W, 8 K, 3 BB, 1 ER, 3 H                    6/4 7 IP, W, 5 K, 2 BB, 1 ER, 5 H   7-1, 3.78 season, next start 6/9 at ChiSox. only drawback is   that he only averages about 5.2 IP per start.  good control.  M. Prior SP ChC: 6/4 6 IP, ND, 8 K, 2 H, 0 ER   1st game back from rehab was stellar, wait until 6/9 start v.   StL to see if hes back for good.  F. Cordero RP Tex: 2-0, 18 S, 1.90 on season.  has 2 games v. Pit   coming up, then 3 v. StL.  he is ready for a breakthrough IMO.  A. Benitez RP Fla: 1-0, 22 S, .56 season.  has been the best RP   in baseball this season.  very consistent, gives up very few   walks and ER.  should be good for 50+ saves this year.  COOLING OFF: hitters:  Pittsburgh in general- 2-8 last 10 games, Mackowiak, Ward, and   Jack Wilson went a combined 15/81 last week, and 3 games v. Oak   this week don't look promising either.  P. Burrell Phi: 43 RBI on the season, only 1 in the last week as   he went 3/20 with 1 run and 5 K.  L. Overbay 1B Mil: avg is OK (6/16) but earlier power numbers are   way down (1 RBI, 0 HR last week).  3 games each v. Ana and Hou   w/ their pitching is not promising.  V. Guerrero OF Ana: 3 games does not make a slump, but beware.   after his 9 RBI game, he has gone 0-12 w/ 3 K in last 3 games. i   would still hold on to him for now, but keep an eye out. 3   games v. Mil should help.  J. Pierre OF Fla: now has 10 CS on the yr, 3 last wk.  avg. has   also dipped about 15 pts last wk.  moved to 2nd in order has not   helped him produce so far. pitchers:  J. Kennedy SP Col: 4-3 3.64 season, last game only 3 IP before   knocked out.  the hot start is over.  dump him while you can.   next start is 6/9 v. NYY at Coors.  P. Martinez SP Bos: 6/2 ND, 5 IP, 4 K, 2 BB, 11 H, 7 ER   lucky not to get a loss last game.  has been very inconsistent   all year.  maybe if he got a deal signed...  injured pitchers:    J. Beckett Fla: 15 day, 5/31, blister   R. Halladay Tor: 15 day 6/4 (retroactive 5/28) shoulder   J. Peavy SD: 15 day 5/27 (r.a. 5/20) forearm sleeper:  Kevin Youkilis 3B Bos: the star of Moneyball by Michael Lewis is   having a consistent rookie season.  over the last week, he is   4/20 w/ 2 runs, 4 RBI, 1 2B, 1 HR, 2 BB, 4 K.  i wouldn't take   him now unless i was nearly out of money, but i will update you    on him periodically.  this ends the first weekly wrap-up.  please comment on anything you disagree with or feel i omitted.  also feel free to comment on the general feedback.  as few people are reading this right now, you have a chance to shape this site significantly for the future.  also, since few people read this, i have no choice but to listen to you, so send whatever you want and tell everybody you know about this.  hope you enjoy and find this helpful. p.s. i took the joke thing off, so you can no longer be offended.

      for all of you millions of people who are already fastidiously reading everything i write and have waited all night for a new post, here you go.  i have decided to dedicate the bulk of this site to analyzing fantasy baseball.  when the season is over, i will probably shift the focus to something else, maybe politics or something.  regardless, i hope to dedicate sundays, wednesdays, and fridays to pitchers, thursdays, saturdays, and mondays to hitters, and tuesday to a weekly wrap-up (it fits my schedule).  today is tuesday, so you get a weekly wrap-up, i guess.  that will be my next post. p.s.  this is a disclaimer on the jokes on the bottom right.  i just signed up for the service.  i realize some are kind of tasteless, but the majority are good enough.  sorry if you are offended.

      sorry about that last link, it definitely does not work.  even if you are logged in to smallworld.com (where this link will take you) it will only tell you your team center not mine.  so i will encourage you to make your own fantasy baseball team anyway (it is free).  if you read this and want to join a league, there is a league you can join.  the league is called "Mrowo" and the password is "facejr" (I did not make this up).  register at smallworld.com and join basic fantasy baseball season 1.  the season is over halfway over, so you probably cant catch up, but it is still fun, and you can do season 2 after all-star game.  my team is tickle me hinrich.  if you have trouble email me at zmattyb@yahoo.com.

      here is a link to see my fantasy baseball scores every day.  im not sure if these will work or not, and i think you have to be a member of smallworld.com (sporting news fantasy games) for it to work.  that probably narrows down the field quite a bit actually now that i think about it.  regardless, i will post this anyway and hope it works.

      sorry that i have not been updating this site very faithfully lately.  if i do this, i have to do it in the morning, and i am either golfing, caddying, or sleeping pretty much every morning. so i am afraid this is not going to be a daily update thing unless somebody can think of a more effective format (eg not talking about the results from last nights games).  if anybody has any good ideas regarding the future of this page, they are more than welcome (actually they dont even have to be good).  i can figure something out, but your input helps.  thank you.

      sorry im a day late i know.&nbsp; i was out late last night, if i posted when i got home it would have been monday anyway.&nbsp; this weeks top 5 is: vegetables (for inspiration read my other blog).&nbsp; actually it is 'vegitables'.&nbsp; anyway, here we go:  5. rudabega- as mentioned before, i do these in reverse order, so this is the last one and i am out of ideas.&nbsp; i have never had this, the word just sounds cool.&nbsp; its my list, i can do what i want with it...  4. peas- cooked only, the pods taste weird.&nbsp; like corn, you can mix them with a lot of foods and they taste good.  3. carrots- only in carrot stick form though.&nbsp; i dip them in butter when no one is looking.&nbsp; cooked carrots lose the texture which is the main attraction for me.&nbsp; 20 million bunny rabbits cant be wrong :)  2. broccoli- i developed an attachment to this at a young age when everyone else hated it and i didnt.&nbsp; only good cooked however, as i was traumatized when i saw wormy type things in uncooked broccoli once (still makes me 'ick', right now i am paranoid-ically scratching my head).&nbsp; very good with melted cheese  1. corn-off the cob, i can mix this 'vegitable' with the rest of the food on my plate and it will taste good.&nbsp; on the cob it is just soooo fun to eat...i dont know why i ever leave the house except to buy it...it is good with butter and a slight peppering  so there are my top 5 'vegitables'.&nbsp; if you think this is a dumb topic, IM headoflettuce43 and give him a piece of your mind.&nbsp; otherwise, feel free to chime in with your sentimental 'vegitable' stories.&nbsp; until next sundayish time period, this has been your top 5.&nbsp; actually it will be after that period too...

      wow i almost forgot about this...but dont fear.&nbsp; hmm this list will be spontaneous...thinking.&nbsp; here we go.&nbsp; this kind of sucks, but its all i can come up with at this time.&nbsp; this weeks top 5 category is: &nbsp; places i would most like to live post-college: &nbsp; 5.&nbsp;hmm...i do these in reverse order, so this is tough...ha, heres an interesting one.&nbsp; london.&nbsp; i think it would be interesting to see how different life is over there.&nbsp; that is the one foreign country i would most like to visit, and my friend said the ladies enjoy american accents :) . i would definitely have to visit there before i decided to live there though.&nbsp; its intriguing nonetheless. &nbsp; 4. boston- i am running out of ideas, but i liked the city.&nbsp; this would probably mean that i ended up going to mit or harvard, which is fine (although im not too big on harvard).&nbsp; i enjoy snow&nbsp;and cold, so i would be at home there.&nbsp; the negatives are that the natives dont seem particularly friendly, and nobody cares about college football there (ooh, boston college...ha!) i guess #1 has a similar dilemma though...boston is a nice enough city &nbsp; 3. columbus oh- although its kind of boring, there are much worse.&nbsp; i am quite used to it, and its a pretty affordable place to live.&nbsp; then you have the buckeyes and the central location of the vaunted buckeye nation (it seems like every other car has a bumper sticker or vanity plate or flag for osu...its awesome!).&nbsp; i would like to have some space from my family though. &nbsp; 2. chicago- i almost liked this as much as #1 (see that shortly), but i didnt get to see much of it, so im not positive.&nbsp; the area on lake shore drive was gorgeous though.&nbsp; plus a great sports town (always a plus :) ) &nbsp; 1. nyc (manhattan preferably)- i went there this spring break, and my visit only made me more enamored of the city than what i had been before.&nbsp; in addition to being the "financial capital of the world" which is kind of my desired career area right now (yes its not terribly exciting, but i find it interesting) its like the citys generators could cut out and the city would still run bc there is so much energy there, if that makes sense.&nbsp; it was awesome, and i would love to live there (although not cheap i would guess).&nbsp; sidenote: i was there the day before the NIT final which michigan was in.&nbsp; when i was walking around times sq i saw 3 tall guys in michigan warmups, so im guessing they were on the basketball team.&nbsp; i wanted to get a pic of the 4 of us holding up our arms like "O-H-I-O", but i kind of wussed out.&nbsp; but i did see them (i think one was courtney sims, very good soph center/forward/not sure).&nbsp; so you can see famousish people there too :) &nbsp; as you can probably see, i would like to live in a big city.&nbsp; i just find small towns kind of depressing bc there seems to be no variety in the life there.&nbsp; it strikes me as a lack of progress, which is something that scares me, in any form.&nbsp; i know that every place has its own advantages, and i have nothing against small towns, they just dont seem to be for me (watch as i end up living in one for the rest of my life).&nbsp; to each his (or her for those that are politically correctly? inclined) own, right?

      (actually from 7.11.04) yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5. this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this. about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite "department" of the blog. without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: "things i heard the most at camp"  5) "hows it going, hoppy?" according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg. to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm. since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly. it could be worse i guess.  4) "hows the ankle?" pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) "i have to pee" to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys. we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed. my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'. peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) "my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)" as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else. some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true. another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents. these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff...  1) "what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?" imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground. i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that. humility is a good thing...  there you have it. i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces! (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay) some of the designers on the other hand...

      (actually from 7.4.04) i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings. this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one. with that in mind, the first category is...music albums! these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums. as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence. without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about. the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me. who says the london club scene is weak? i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground another incredible techno/trance album. this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing. the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods "God bless the usa") anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks. the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k this is the most diverse album up here. they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you). i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well. the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway). 3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album. the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old. karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place). kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5. if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).

      this weeks edition (on time might i add) is inspired by last weeks espn/usa today coaches poll for college football.  it is: top 5 most overrated teams not named ohio state in the top 25.  5. clemson (16)-a 'hot pick' bc of a qb and a win over fsu last yr...and a coachs last name (bowden).  very difficult schedule, and i dont think they are very good on d either way.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25 (on record projections, im not sure exactly how many games each team will play, which could make some records impossible.  im just lazy i guess).  4. k state (13)-without roberson, teams can stack the box easily and at least slow sproles down.  not a very tough schedule, they might end up top 10, but i still wont think theyre that good.  projection: 10-3, #13  3. miami (5)-sorry to knock on them so much here...not really.  they lost a lot of talent, and they play a real schedule this yr.  projection: 10-3, #11  2. virginia (19)-overrated last yr, only difference is that they lost a qb (schaub) hmm...sounds like a top 25 team...only thing they have is solid lb play.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25  1. auburn (18)-remember last years 'sleeper' team?  the one that slept pretty soundly offensively vs. usc in opener (23-0 i believe)?  they came on in the middle of the season, but i dont think theyre anything special.  projection: 8-5, outside top 25  i could obviously be completely wrong on all of these, its mainly just my gut...at least i had the balls to pick them.  we shall see what happens.  i cannot wait for college football season!!!!!

      just got back from driving my neighbor back from the airport (i run a taxi company in my spare time...).  there was a bad accident on 270 east just west of 71.  there was a semi overturned on the side, and there was a pickup w/ a boat on back in the road w/ its front end completely smashed.  they had to block off 2 or 3 lanes of 270 which just left 3 open.  it was pretty congested.  i think i cut about 5 or 6 people off to get through all of the traffic, but i had to get to the airport in time (i ended up having about 15 minutes to spare).  so im kind of wondering if everybody involved is ok or not.  there were a bunch of cops plus a crane there, but i didnt see an ambulance, which either means it had already come or nobody was hurt.  i can probably update you on this tomorrow.  it was kind of sobering to see after i was getting very frustrated with traffic before i knew what happened.  i guess tomorrow is never guaranteed.  now im getting philosophical here...there now im over it :) .  im going to go watch last comic standing now.  that show is kind of dumb, but i am somewhat addicted (what else are you going to do on a tuesday night other than sit at home and watch tv?...rhetorical question alert).  peace out my children

      i just got finished cleaning my bathroom!  it was the first time i ever did the whole thing by myself.  i scrubbed the toilet and bathtub, and the counter, and then i mopped the floor.  now i am kind of sticky.  nonetheless i am quite proud of myself.  today i decided to stay home to do stuff around the house.  i am being forced to make a filing system for the whole college application thing, so i spent a couple of hours this morning setting that up.  after that i cut the grass, which is when i found out that it is really quite a nice day out.  this afternoon i will probably go play with my neighbors cat (as a job, not just because i have nothing better to do) then go hit balls at the range. another exciting thing today...i got my sat II subject test scores back in the mail.  i got 800 on math IIC, 740 chemistry and 740 writing.  i was quite shocked, especially about the chemistry which i thought i got about 550 on, and especially since i was almost dead the day i took it (sick, i slept the entire day after i got back.  very very sick, not to mention miserable.  my theory is that in every test room there is a sick kid who is sniffling and coughing constantly.  i just happened to be that person that day.)  the thing that surprised me is that the 800 (perfect score) is only the 90 percentile, which means 10% of the people get a perfect.  i guess its not that incredibly hard or something.  anyway, i am just excited about that whole thing.  :))))))  (not sure how to make excited smiley, he is smiling a lot though, as you can see. hopefully its good enough)

      yes, this means that i am back home again.  actually we got back saturday night, but i have been pretty busy.  the trip was awesome.  the only other times i have been to chicago (twice) were just connector flights through o'hare, so this was the first time i had seen the city.  we stayed downtown, so we walked around the lake shore park area, which was beautiful.  unfortunately, the traffic was terrible (worse than nyc, imo, i have heard that la traffic is worse...i really pity them if it is), so everything like the museums and shedd aquarium was closed.  the next day (friday) we went to visit campus.  i loved u chicago.  it just felt like they had the same sort of priorities that i would want (they also seemed proud that theyre the only school undefeated vs. notre dame in football...yeah, 1-0 or something).  the campus was beautiful too.  i think it is probably in my top 3 schools now (yale, william and mary), plus its a little easier to get into.  i was surprised at how seriously chicago took its baseball.  the city series (cubs/sox) was starting up the day we left, so that probably contributed, but the obsession was nearing the ohio state football level in columbus (an inascertainable level, the benchmark of all irrational obsessions i would say...although not a bad one by any means).  i think i could live in a city like that. after the visit, we drove to st louis friday night.  our hotel room was upgraded to a vip suite...we were the "customer of the day"...not sure what that is all about, but the room was cool.  we ate at j bucks in clayton (suburb), where i realized that st louis was probably as into sports as chicago.  i guess that there isnt much else in the midwest that we are so narrow-minded.  anyway, saturday morning we visited wustl, which i liked, not as much as uc, but it seemed to be a place i wouldnt mind going to.  i think i will apply there too. we got back saturday night so i would have time to go to a meeting sunday morning for camp counselors for a camp i am helping with at my church.  i get to be with 3rd grade boys for a week (july 6-10 i think).  it will be interesting to say the least.  i am looking forward to it. this morning i had my first tournament of the yr.  i was gang-raped by mosquitoes early on, so i am trying to move as little as possible now.  i overcame them to an extent, and i ended up shooting 89.  while that sounds terrible, i actually played very well, i just had 3 bad holes (2 triple-bogeys and a quad).  if you take those away it was a decent round, plus the course was tough and i hadnt played it before.  i tied for 2nd in the tournament (that should give you an idea of how 'strong' the league is-86 won it).  the group i played in was pretty bad.  on one whole we lost 8 balls (as a foursome).  the other kids kept having to go back and re-hit from the tee.  i just sat on the ground and waited, then i started cracking up...kind of like the judges on american idol during auditions.  i felt mean, but i couldnt help it.  the kids behind us were getting pretty mad, which was probably the funniest part.  they hit into us a couple of times...you have to find humor in these things i guess.  there were scores of 12 and 10 on that hole (and they both kind of cheated, but i felt bad for them).  in case youre wondering, i lost a ball but still made bogey-6 (it would have been a birdie if i hadnt lost a ball) so ha. i believe i am going to go see spiderman 2 wednesday night.  brad picked up a bunch of tickets, so hopefully everyone will be early so i dont have to sit in the aisle again (see dodgeball post).  i should probably rent the 1st spiderman since i still havent seen it.  i think thats all i have to say...this is a pretty long post, congrats if you made it all the way here:) the end.

      i am not going to be posting on this for a couple of days, as i am going on a couple of college visits with the parents.  we are driving (grr) to chicago tomorrow and visiting u chicago, then to st louis to visit washington u in stl.  i am looking forward to both, even though i have been bombarded with mail from wustl (i dont care about a postcard with alumni giving rates or percentage of graduates getting into medical school 4 times a week).  somebody needs to tell them this.  it actually decreases my interest. i caddied for the first time this year.  got a double bag at 12:40, just in time for the sun to be baking on me the entire day (who would want to caddy when its not 90 degrees with no clouds or wind).  this would have been a perfect day to golf.  complaining aside, i made 130, so it was more than worth it.  my shoulder might differ with me on that.  i couldnt hold the steering wheel driving back home after the loop bc my shoulder was so weak (unlike the rest of my body...) on a side note, i saw the "soup nazi" episode on tbs tonight.  all of my friends have told me about it and quoted it, so i was expecting a lot.  it was nothing special though.  i guess my hopes were too high.  i thought the gay thugs that stole elaines armoire from kramer were funnier.  that has to be the most brilliant show EVER. yes, EVER. anyway, i have an early departure time tomorrow, so i should get to bed soon.  i should be back by sunday.

      i am sick of getting up at 5:44 every morning!  even if i can get to bed by 11:30 or 12 i still only get 6 hours of sleep...i cant live like this! i 'accidentally' broke my 8-iron shaft on saturday, so i took it in yesterday to get a new one.  i didnt throw it hard or anything, so im guessing it was pretty weak already.  thats $25 down the drain. i went to a party last night at chales'.  we played crap (a billiards game, not the casino thing), and i kept getting stuck behind cody who is really gay and kept giving me letters, so i only won once.  it was embarassing since i am incredible at that game...maybe ;)

      its been a while (2 whole days) since the last post, so this might be a bit long, we shall see.  yesterday, i played 27 holes of golf.  i sucked up the first 9, but then i came back w/ a 39 on the back, so i went an extra 9 holes to try to break 80 (an elusive goal that has consumed my golfing life since i broke 90).  i started off fine, but i had 2 straight 3-putts and a lost ball, which killed me, so i ended up with 39-44 83, which is my best for this season as of yet.  i was happy enough, but i know i blew it.  that just gives me something to push for this summer i guess. last night i saw dodgeball with a bunch of friends.  i got there late, so we had to sit in the aisle.  then some usher kicked us out bc it was a 'fire hazard'.  we got back in, but we had to split up.  i ended up next to some guy in the 2nd row.  there were some interesting parts, i will say that (the pizza thing, ick), but it was funny for the most part.  it could have been better, but it fulfilled its purpose of mindless entertainment imo.  we went out for sushi after that.  i dont really like sushi, but it was fun. this morning i played golf w/ my dad, my pastor, and another guy from church.  they wouldnt play for money (6-6-6 $5 nassau), which is unfortunate bc i won every 6 w/ my partner (we played for 'bragging rights', which last time i checked wont help pay for tuition).  nobody, including myself, played particularly well, but we had a good time.  after that, i went to gregs grad party at 'the barn' in westerville.  its a pretty cool place, i wouldnt mind having mine there. so there is my activity list of the last couple days.  after the party i sat at home and watched the us open.  did anybody else see the 7 green?  i have only played 1 green like that, and it is completely unfair (i 5-putted it in a tournament, it kept rolling backwards 20+ feet).  that shouldnt happen in a professional tournament.  however, everyone played the same unfair green, so in a roundabout way it was fairish.  i am pulling for phil, but i dont have anything against anybody near the top.  it should be fun to watch.

      hmm, i think todays theme would be rain, which causes things to become wet when exposed to it, including people such as myself.  i played golf today, but i had to call it a round after 16 holes bc of this natural phenomenon.  not too much of a loss, as it was not a particularly good round.  i think i was rushing things out there today.  i went to the range around noon, and the only part that was open were the mats (no chipping/putting or grass tees).  i hate hitting off mats, but its better than not hitting. also contributing to todays theme is the us open, which is currently delayed bc of rain. not like i would be able to watch it since we dont get espn anymore...grr.  the course doesnt seem to be playing that difficile. on a side note, i do believe that detroit won the nba title, and for that they are offerred (sp?) my most sincere congrats.  as for the lakers, there is always next yr (oh wait, no there isnt).  hahaha they are going to get disbanded i hope.  they were the closest thing this age in sports will get to a dynasty imo.  its the circle of life applied to sport.  if you think about it, you can apply most of lifes themes to sport...  its growing on you isnt it?

      i hate it when i prove myself wrong.  the class today was so awesome. it had nothing to do with going the speed limit or not cutting people off.  we did a skid car, drag racing, and cone maneuverability.  we also did this thing where you floor it through water then slam on the brakes and control your skid so you dont run over "kenny" (aka a bunch of cones).  needless to say i killed kenny quite a few times (where have i seen this before?).  it was still fun, and i met a lot of new people (john, richard, erica, amanda, feel free to comment now).  it rained a lot too, which made the skid car even skiddier.  i guess that this was in fact not a wasted day.  another bonus, i drove through amish country to get there, and i got to pass a real horse and buggy thing on the road!  i figured it was an urban legend (or rural legend is more like it...boo, not funny), but its not.  so all in all a good day. im probably going to the class party at dans tonight, that might go a bit late.  wow, it just kind of hit me that im a senior now.  how empowering...

      another day, another 85 on the links.  this one i was not happy with.  i was +2 thru 7 holes then i fell apart.  i only hit 4 greens, so i guess it could have been much worse.  the heat got to me again, i couldnt make 36 holes.  ill probably go hit at the driving range this afternoon or something.  i just remembered, tomorrow my mom is making me take an all-day "defensive driving" class.  grr.  i dont need help driving, since i havent had any accidents or tickets in over a year.  i am viewing tomorrow as a wasted day. maybe i will end up enjoying it (smirks knowingly).

      i slept in some this morning, so i only got 18 holes in today.  i think the weather could best be described as sweltering...i was dying.  anyway, i played so much better than yesterday, i shot 85 on a much harder course.  i could have done better, but my irons apparently all decided to go about 15 yards farther than normal today.  that took me about 8 holes to figure out...i flew the green of a 155 yard par 3 with a 7-iron by about 20 yards.  that is a complete anomaly, quite frustrating.  however, it was encouraging.  i finally got to see day after tomorrow w/ cody and chad.  it was pretty good.  some of the effects were a bit weak, but they would be hard to do.  we got our popcorn ($5.50!) from seth gemperline.  i hadnt realized he worked there.  if it doesnt rain too hard tonight im going to go play another 18 or 36 tomorrow, depending on how early i feel like getting up.  i ran out of water for about 6 holes today, and i am still feeling a bit sick (hence the post name).  i should be able to overcome this however.

      after church today, i played 9 holes with my dad.  this is only my 3rd time out this yr since i have been so busy w/ school and stuff.  i hit the ball like complete trash.  seriously, i was so mad.  i shot a 46, and thats only b/c i made 4 15+ foot putts.  i have a lot of work to do this summer if i want to be worth anything on the team this fall.  i just got a membership at a local club for the summer, so im going to go play 36 holes tomorrow if i can.  talked to dan, he just got back from mexico.  we might go play tomorrow if he doesnt have to work all day.  im getting excited for the pistons tonight...i still hope they kill LA.  speaking of that  urlLink i read this great article on espn.com.  they even make fun of devean george.  there is a link on here, but if you dont want to read the whole thing, heres the best part...         Six days ago, most people outside of Detroit thought there was     no way they could contain Devean and the Hall of Famers. Now     it seems impossible that the Lakers will be able to stand up     to the soul tide rolling through this series.  ha.  what do you have to say now, devean?  nothing? thats what i thought.

      after getting up around 7 (ack) the drive to ohio was only about 9 1/2 hrs, not bad.  then i got to go mow the lawn before it rains again, bad.  i made it though.  i just downloaded this awesome song by some scandinavian techno guy (tiesto or something like that).  i think all techno should be illegal unless its scandinavian.  this is incredible stuff. -- i spent a lot of time this week watching the reagan funeral.  i dont think there is any more touching song than amazing grace.  when they get to the last stanza, i get chills.  then during the burial ceremony, they had a guy play it on bagpipes.  that is even better than scandinavian techno-my favorite song on my favorite instrument!  i guess the bagpipe is a love/hate thing, i find it eerily beautiful.  i find european music better than american for the most part i guess. i want bagpipes at my funeral! this whole funeral thing has put me in somewhat of a reflective mood.  its kind of like 'what will i do that people will talk about at my funeral'.  its a motivating thought to me.  anybody with me on that? -- during the drive i read a book called the chosen by chaim potok.  it starts out like any enjoyable fiction story, then it gets really deep into things like hardcore friendship and philosophy and that kind of stuff. it reminded me of another book, a separate peace by john knowles. it was quite engrossing.  i would recommend it to anyone who considers themself introspective.  so that in conjunction with the whole funeral bit has put me in a bit of a reflective, morbid, and rambling mood. -- i think i will go update my other blog and go catch some SNL or something.  take the care!

      i was at my grandparents' house this week in virginia beach. it has been scorching lately, but its raining right now.  not a thunderstorm or anything, just rain.  honestly, my favorite weather is a summer thunderstorm at dusk.  it is so awesome to listen to.  i always sleep with my window open those days.  anyway, we are driving back to ohio tomorrow, and we are supposed to leave at 8.  this is not what i had in mind for summer vacation.  such is life i guess.

      this is my second blog. i started doing a blog of fantasy baseball update type stuff (i will make a link soon in case you care), so this is a more personal blog.  feel free to comment or share your thoughts (a form of commenting if you think about it) whereever you want to. i was watching the nba finals game 3.  i am sooo incredibly glad the pistons won.  i hate the lakers, seriously hate them.  especially devean george annoys me.  he is like a leech that just hangs onto kobe and shaq, and then when he needs to contribute, he cant step it up.  when detroit went on a run in the 3rd, rip was running a break after a board, and george was trying to guard him, but he is too slow, so he just flopped.  thankfully he didnt get the call, but i cant stand players like that (see vlade divac).  anyway, the only laker i really respect is kobe.  at least he tries all the time, unlike his team for the most part.  he really is a great player.  now that i think about it, i dont have much against shaq.  i just hope the pistons can pull this off.  on a side note, has anyone seen that viagra commercial with the fat and old guys jumping around with queen "we are the champions" playing in the background?  if you think about it, there are some disgusting implications there.  i get so sick whenever i think about it.  therefore, i will try to make you sick as well. sorry, its too late to change anything.  i believe i will go get some sleep now.  have a great friday, now that it is officially friday.

      it has been awhile since i got up as early as 5:19.&nbsp; it wasnt that bad actually.&nbsp; i got to the course before it was open, so i ended up teeing off around 6:35.&nbsp; i ran into this guy from the grounds crew that absolutely hates me 4 times this round.&nbsp; i hit into him once while he was mowing the green, and&nbsp;i thought he had seen me.&nbsp; now he interrogates me every time, like 'did you check in with the starter', then 'who was there', and 'you shouldnt be starting this early, give us a chance to mow these'.&nbsp; its very frustrating, especially when i see him yukking it up (yes i just said that.&nbsp; its a cool phrase...) w/ other golfers.&nbsp; of course, he might just hate me bc i am young or something.&nbsp; who knows...the round went ok.&nbsp; i have a lot to work on, so i struggled at least in the scoring category, but i hit the ball pretty well.&nbsp; i only had 1 birdie though.&nbsp; need to work on that... when i went to the parking lot to leave, i found that there was a beer delivery truck right in front of my car with no possible escape, so i was stuck there for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; i just thought i would share that, since it was a minor annoyance.&nbsp; i made it throught that though. in other news, the saturn is working again.&nbsp; the battery was indeed dead, so my mom took it to the shop for me, and its all better (hopefully).&nbsp; now i dont have to give my dad a ride to work again which means getting up 20 minutes earlier.&nbsp; (yay)

      i was driving to my golf lesson today, and i saw a hitchiker on the entrance ramp from 23 north onto 270 east.&nbsp; for those not acquainted with i-270, it is basically a circle around columbus (i guess there is one in st louis as well, and then i-70 runs through both cities too...creepy).&nbsp; anyway, i found this a humorous spot to try to catch a ride.&nbsp; she wasnt going to get any farther than 25 miles from where she started (yes i know people can take exit ramps onto other highways, it was just funny).&nbsp; i am considering starting a new blog for stuff i see on the road.&nbsp; i probably wont, but its a consideration.&nbsp; now if i was a trucker or something i would definitely do this, and i would love to read something like that.&nbsp; many interesting sights out there... the dispute thingy from AIM has been cleared up thank goodness. now&nbsp;i can sleep, which is great since i am leaving at 5:40 tomorrow (leaving, not waking up).&nbsp; this is bc the saturn wouldnt start.&nbsp; i think it is the battery, so its getting towed tomorrow.&nbsp; meanwhile, i will drive my dad to work then go play golf after that.&nbsp; i think im going to bed within a half-hour. i started reading jane eyre tonight, and i fell asleep about 30 pages into it.&nbsp; i think it was me being tired as opposed to it being boring, which was the case with 'texas' by james michener which put me to sleep 4 times.&nbsp; that book took me so long, probably twice as long as any other book i have ever read. &nbsp;literally (maybe not the Bible, but thats it).&nbsp; jane eyre is actually fairly interesting, even in the beginning.&nbsp; i have high expectations for it now... one other thing: i was on  urlLink espn.com &nbsp;today and i was reading about bad athlete-turned-musicians, and they had audio clips.&nbsp; one was pro wrestlers or something.&nbsp;  urlLink here is a link to some 30 second clips , the worst one in my opinion is track 10.&nbsp; its like elmer fudd meets a 3-year old banging on a pot or something.&nbsp; definitely a must hear.&nbsp; if that doesnt keep you up all night, nothing will :)

      well, yesterday i was talking to various people on AIM and i think i managed to get 5 or 6 people mad in some way or another.&nbsp; all bc of a misstatement.&nbsp; this is why i dont like talking on AIM, bc you cant clarify things and they can get out of hand.&nbsp; grr...hopefully things will work out, i think they will.&nbsp; like i said earlier, i hate having people mad at me.&nbsp; i cant sleep and i get all stressed out.&nbsp; i think thats bc of my analytical mind which makes me constantly thinking about the whole situation. i did talk to ryan (my friend from florida, now kentucky) yesterday, and he is probably coming up this weekend.&nbsp; if he does, i think he might stay with me.&nbsp; i havent seen him in so long, i am kind of worried that he has changed.&nbsp; people tend to do that... i golfed this morning.&nbsp; i was just teeing off on #1 w/ nobody in sight when a guy came up behind me and asked if i wanted to play alone or not, of course i said 'you can join, sure, blah blah blah' even though i didnt really want to.&nbsp; it was and older guy named john, hes been a member there for about 20 years.&nbsp; he was nice enough, but he kept complaining about how bad he was playing.&nbsp; that gets kind of annoying.&nbsp; then on #10 we were joined by another older guy named joe from alabama.&nbsp; the good thing about those 2 is that they were pretty fast, but we ended up being stuck behind a group the entire time, so my round took about 3 1/2 hrs.&nbsp; i almost holed out for eagle on #12, a par 5.&nbsp; i laid up to about 100 yards, then i took a half-pitching wedge, and stuck it about 4 inches from the hole.&nbsp; that was easily the highlight of my day as i did not play very well (yes i am a hypocrite for complaining about golf, but this is why i have this blog, to complain and so forth).&nbsp; at the beginning of the round, every time i stepped over the ball, i KNEW i was going to hit a bad shot.&nbsp; it has been a few years since that happened.&nbsp; i did par all 4 par 3s though, kind of.&nbsp; they kept giving me putts whenever i hit it within 3 feet or so and hitting them back to me.&nbsp; oh well, its probably for the better that i didnt have an 'official score'.&nbsp; such is life

      my senior picture photo shoot went well as far as i could tell.&nbsp; i felt a little awkward with some of the poses, like when i was lying on the floor and he was like 'roll towards me a little bit'.&nbsp; i felt like a bikini model or something (since i obviously know exactly what that feels like).&nbsp; that withstanding, i think everything should turn out well.&nbsp; when i first talked to him today, he said 'if i remember correctly, you tend to blink a lot.'&nbsp; grr...this was bc he took the golf team pictures outside last fall and i was staring into the sun...all bc i wanted to have the girls soccer team in the background :)&nbsp; i think it was worth it.&nbsp; i only blinked during one picture today though.&nbsp; i have no idea when i will get the pictures back or at least see them.&nbsp; hopefully soon. i finished the hunchback of notre dame today (finally!).&nbsp; i honestly have no idea how they made a wishbone episode out of that book.&nbsp; 75% of it is not suitable for little kids.&nbsp; that is on the conservative end, too.&nbsp; it was quite a depressing ending, and the entire book was kind of scattered as well as morbid.&nbsp; i have mixed feelings on it...next up is jane eyre, which i think is the ultimate chick book.&nbsp; my mom reads it pretty much every year.&nbsp; i am looking forward to this less than i was rebecca.&nbsp; i think its the longest book i have to read, too.&nbsp; i guess i will have to suck it up at get it over with, right?&nbsp; (yes)

      last night i was at a party at chads, and brad told me he knew a kid named john corkendorfer in michigan.&nbsp; i found this quite enlightening.&nbsp; this has got to be one of the coolest names ever.&nbsp; seriously, say it out loud, and you instantly feel cool.&nbsp; when you get mad, say 'john corkendorfer' and you will have no choice but to be happy.&nbsp; i got to see some people i hadnt seen all summer last night, which was nice.&nbsp; now i kind of want school to start so i can see some of my friends again.&nbsp; kind of.&nbsp; we just hung out all night really.&nbsp; we played catchphrase too.&nbsp; one word i got was 'chain', so i said ___ of fools, which nobody got, so then i started singing __, ___, ___, ___ of fools.&nbsp; i think everybody on the other team knew it, but nobody on my team did.&nbsp; heather seemed to enjoy my performance at least.&nbsp; if im going to make a fool of myself, somebody should at least get it right.&nbsp; another phrase i got was 'jake and the fat man'.&nbsp; i was like what the heck is this?&nbsp; i still have no idea.&nbsp; anyway, i got home late and still forced myself up early today&nbsp;to go golf.&nbsp; i got to the course around 7:30 and found that there was a tournament, so i had to go back home.&nbsp; i slept for a few hours after that.&nbsp; i woke up and my mom told me to go scrub the trash barrel.&nbsp; not sure when this became my job, but it smelled terrible.&nbsp; it was not a pleasant experience.&nbsp; such is life.&nbsp; after this i went with some people to see i robot (i had been delaying this movie for awhile since i thought it looked dumb).&nbsp; it actually wasnt bad at all.&nbsp; i was pleasantly surprised once again.&nbsp; then we went to chipotle. when we were outside eating we witnessed some road rage:&nbsp; 2 kids in a beat up crown vic were following some lady, and when she parked, they pulled up next to her.&nbsp; when she got out, they got out and started yelling and swearing at her.&nbsp; she was like 50 years old.&nbsp; i can understand yelling at a peer or something, but if you want to act tough, dont yell at an old lady.&nbsp; kids these days, they have no respect :)&nbsp; after this we went to codys and hung out.&nbsp; i played him in pingpong and i lost 21-10, 20-22 (1), 22-20 (1).&nbsp; it was a good match once i warmed up.&nbsp; he is the only person who ever beats me with any frequency, probably bc he plays tennis all the time and also bc he knows to hit to my backhand.&nbsp; so close. and thats my little update on my life over the past 2ish days.&nbsp; pictures are tomorrow at 10 am, so no golf in the morning.&nbsp; all the outfits are ready to go!&nbsp; i will let you know how it all turns out, and maybe post them if i can figure out how, at least once i get them back.&nbsp; until then...

      i am sorry for the redundancy (ironic given the title...ha!) of writing about the 'cant live a day' remix of avalon by dj tiesto.&nbsp; i forgot i wrote about it the 1st time.&nbsp; anyway, i guess this means i like it a lot.&nbsp; i probably didnt even need to post this as nobody else would have noticed.&nbsp; oh well, i have satisfied myself and my oc (if you dont know what oc means, read this months archives).&nbsp; good night this time, for real!

      there is so much good music out there that nobody knows about.&nbsp; today i stumbled upon andy hunter (actually i had heard of him, but i hadnt listened to him), who i guess is considered the #1 Christian dj, at least in the trance realm.&nbsp; good stuff...another song i found is a remix by none other than dj tiesto on the song 'cant live a day' by avalon.&nbsp; this is all on radiou's (Christian rock station in columbus) electrik cirkus (i think thats the spelling) playlist.&nbsp; theres a link to the radiou homepage in the sidebar (my favorite radio station),  urlLink here is one right here to the electrik thingy page .&nbsp; apparently they spell it electric circus...i could have sworn they did something weird w/ it...oh well.  i was thinking about what to do tomorrows top 5 on, so i turned to chad for help.&nbsp; since the topic will suck, you have him to blame.&nbsp; this is the 'eye' of the brainstorm...i just thought of that...that was pretty good, huh?  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; whats a good topic to do a top 5 type thing on?&nbsp;&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; movies?  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; i dont really like movies that much, remember?  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; oh yeha  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; um bands  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; something more interesting, w/ some oomph.&nbsp; as in oomph  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; k&nbsp;&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; strippers  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; shut up&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp;i'm thinking. that was just to get the juices flowing  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; not very well  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol oh ty  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; something random other than strippers&nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; lol &nbsp;  headoflettuce43:&nbsp; vegitable&nbsp;  Rogerclam73:&nbsp; k  so there you have it, i am doing my top 5 on "vegitable(s)" tomorrow.&nbsp; goodnight!

      this title has no significance to the post that i know of, i just wrote it.&nbsp; i feel obligated to title these things.&nbsp; anyway...yesterday we did not end up seeing the bourne supremacy bc they were out of tickets.&nbsp; so we went to codys and rented the bourne identity instead.&nbsp; i had forgotten how much i liked that movie.&nbsp; i heard the new one isnt quite as good, but its still pretty good.&nbsp; they went to see it today, but i couldnt bc i was golfing with my dad.&nbsp; i didnt play very well, but we had fun even though it took about 5 hours.&nbsp; i hate golfing weekends and afternoons bc it takes forever.&nbsp; a 5-hour round takes up the entire afternoon, but if you can sacrifice some sleep and tee off at 6:30, it takes 3 hours max, and nobody else is even awake, so you have the rest of the day free.&nbsp; i guess that in europe everybody plays 3 hour rounds, even foursomes.&nbsp; if i ever go to england, i will have to go play some golf there.&nbsp; it seems too good to be true. i went shopping yesterday for senior picture outfits as well as general wardrobe maintainance.&nbsp; i got a polo at j crew, its kind of cobalt blue with narrow white horizontal stripes, then a kelly green polo at gap, and a navy long sleeve button up shirt from ralph lauren.&nbsp; i think the last one is the only one im wearing for pictures, the other ones are just for some variety on the course.&nbsp; next up is a red or pink polo shirt, hopefully in time for tryouts.&nbsp; also i need a new hat to go with the kelly green shirt.&nbsp; i am thinking maybe a white visor w/ green accent, if i can find one.&nbsp; if you want to think of what you should do in this situation, i would be wearing very light khaki shorts with a brown leather belt, and black/brown alligator skin golf shoes w/ short black socks.&nbsp; in case you were wondering.&nbsp; actually i would greatly appreciate input on this.&nbsp; if i cant play well i should at least look good :) another great song i found really quick: cant live a day remix feat. dj tiesto- avalon.&nbsp; great great beat, get the song or album (o2: avalon remixed).&nbsp; later!

      yesterday, i wasted about 6 hours of my day working on tech stuff at church.&nbsp; i was helping with a vbs followup service, and my responsibilities amounted to hitting play and stop on a dvd player.&nbsp; they could have had a kindergartner do it.&nbsp; then i helped "tear down" aka winding up some cords.&nbsp; i did get to see some of my kids from camp though.&nbsp; one kid kept jumping off the stage onto me at the end, then he pretended that he hurt his ankle. little monster...i said if you keep doing that, your ankle is really going to hurt.&nbsp; all in good fun of course. i played 9 holes again today, and i feel fine, anklewise at least.&nbsp; i played so well, but i putted like...(trying to think of something that is bad at putting)...something bad at putting.&nbsp; have you ever had 4 3-putt bogeys in 9 holes? i did.&nbsp; another interesting fact:&nbsp;(follow closely, a bit confusing)&nbsp; i was as many over par on the holes where i hit the green in regulation as i was on the holes where i didnt hit the green in regulation (all you nongolfer types ignore that).&nbsp; anyway, i hit 6 out of 9 greens, had 20 putts (yes 20) and shot 42.&nbsp; very frustrating, but encouraging as far as ball striking was concerned. i think i am going to go see the bourne supremacy tonight, not sure when.&nbsp; i dont really like seeing non-comedy movies that much, but this looks pretty good.&nbsp; i will rate it tomorrow probably for you, since you respect my opinion so much. i got the u chicago "uncommon" application (they are quite proud of this title) yesterday.&nbsp; i looked at the essays, and they are much better than the common app.&nbsp; not sure which one i am going to do.&nbsp; i can post them here, if you have any suggestions as far as which one i should do, feel free to drop a comment.&nbsp; here you go: i just looked at them again, they are too long to type, i will summarize. here we go again: 1) write an essay somehow inspired by super-huge mustard (like at sams club) 2) talk about how language sets people apart, covering peculiarities of your own personal language, how does it make you unique, etc. 3) "any law that uplifts human personality in just, any law that degrades human personality is unjust" wrote mlk jr in 'letter from birm. jail'. give your thoughts on justice as it relates to 'human personality'. 4) i have already decided this is too confusing and not that interesting, so im not doing it.&nbsp; plus its about twice as long as any other essay, so i will not write it.&nbsp; apply to u chicago yourself if youre that desperate to see it 5) write your own essay question, like applicants did for # 1 and #2.  thats it.&nbsp; i am leaning towards 1 or 2.&nbsp; i think they can learn a lot more about an applicant this way than by saying 'how did you respond to an ethical dilemma' or 'who has had an impact on your life', so this application might actually be enjoyable. i downloaded a new song last night, called 'amazing' by george michael.&nbsp; its good, but nothing special.&nbsp; the preview only lets you hear the first 30 sec of the song, which were good, but the rest was kind of repetitive.&nbsp; i guess its a dance/pop mix, with very few vocals.&nbsp; its not a 'listen to on repeat' song for me though.

      yes, this is my secret identity, i have been hiding it from you this whole time...just kidding! ha.&nbsp; not even tiger would have teed off when i did this morning.&nbsp; it was raining so hard.&nbsp; when i got there at 7:30 this morning (yes i cheated and set my alarm an hour later last night, i need to ease into this 5:44 stuff) everybody was hiding in the clubhouse from the rain or something.&nbsp; i was like to the manager 'can i go out?' and he was like 'i think its unplayable, but you can try if you want' and i was like 'whoa' and he was like 'woot'.&nbsp; after this dialog, i teed off in the rain, and since i didnt warm up and my hands were already wet, i kind of duffed the tee shot and the rest of the shots on that hole and i got an 8.&nbsp; it didnt help that there was a creek where there wasnt supposed to be 100 yards out with more tributaries than the nile river delta (i thought of that one when i was on the course.&nbsp; not bad, eh?)&nbsp; then the green was kind of flooded too.&nbsp; i got used to the rain after that, and i ended up shooting 45, which would have been decent to poor before injury, so i was quite encouraged.&nbsp; i didnt play that well, but i didnt play poorly either, so it was a successful round.&nbsp; i didnt get hurt at all, except on 9 i jumped up to see if i was on the green and i kind of forgot about my ankle.&nbsp; then i remembered it.&nbsp; its fine now though. so a good experience all in all. apparently i have to go do some technical stuff at church tonight for some kids service.&nbsp; i didnt learn about this until today, so i am a bit irritated, but its ok.&nbsp; later!

      actually you would be better off reading one of the other post, not a whole lot to say.&nbsp; i am not relishing the thought of getting up at 5:44 tomorrow morning after about 3 weeks of sleeping in every morning.&nbsp; plus there are supposed to be thunderstorms, which according to my dad are incredibly deadly.&nbsp; if i get struck by lightning i would rather it be on a golf course.&nbsp; anyway, i like playing in the rain.&nbsp; i guess it makes me feel tougher than most other golfers (shut up, golfers are among the toughest people out there...sometimes we go 5 or 6 holes w/out a cart girl :) .&nbsp; seriously, though, i get a sense of pride and dedication when i play in a downpour, plus it is a change from the usual scorchiness.)  urlLink i have a link to a website i found today that i guess is sweeping the nation here. &nbsp; its jibjab.com or something.&nbsp; its basically making fun of kerry and bush, which gives it a wider&nbsp;appeal.&nbsp; quite funny imo, although its already gotten a little old.&nbsp; i would limit viewings to 5 or fewer personally.&nbsp; it has a little profanity, but that never killed anyone (i hope not at least). one other thing: is it even debatable that seinfeld is the best show ever on tv? it is the only show where i can still crack up even if ive seen it 3 or 4 times before (yes i just watched it on tbs: bless you ted turner...wow i never thought i would say that...please keep the reruns on forever!) i have to go to bed so early tonight its not funny.&nbsp; goodnight!

      i dont have much time for this post (dinner) but since i might not be able to get back on tonight, here is my post in a nutshell...hit a jumbo bucket at the range today, and my ankle held up ok, so i am going to play at least 9 holes tomorrow (trembling w/ excitement) this means that you will once again be subject to me describing my rounds, but im sure you missed reading that as much as i missed writing it :) (sidenote:&nbsp; ironically when i was typing 'writing' i accidentally wrote 'writhing'...maybe its a subconcious impulse or something).&nbsp; so i am excited about that.&nbsp; i got my yale application in the mail today.&nbsp; i looked over it, i guess theyre part of the common app, which i kind of hate.&nbsp; the essay questions are so ridiculously stupid and broad that i have no idea what to write.&nbsp; these essays are everywhere, and i hate them.&nbsp; for my sat II writing test, i ended up writing about my friend sliding across my car hood in the rain like 'dukes of hazard' and denting it...come on, who wants to read this.&nbsp; then in 9th grade proficiency testing, i wrote about arthur (yes the tv show on pbs...whats wrong with that?).&nbsp; to summarize this, i hate non-specific essays.&nbsp; something should be done, like say 'write about an animal the same color as your favorite color and starts w/ the same letter as your first name and their experience at the fair' or something like that (shut up, you try and think of something specific and relevant)...this parenthetical statement kind of justifies the broad essay...ack. one more thing, it has been an incredible last 2 days being a fantasy baseball owner w/ travis hafner on the squad...5 hr and 11 rbi last 2 games means i am moving up in my division w/out having my pitchers play (2 starters pitch tomorrow)...this last section is not b/c anybody cares about my fantasy baseball (trust me...i have never found anybody that cares about this other than my 10th grade english teacher...), i am just excited that a 1B is outproducing most pitchers.&nbsp; so yes, thats about it, and im going to go eat.&nbsp; until the next post...

      today was much more relaxing than yesterday, except not being able to get to sleep until 4:30 (i think i talked about that last post).&nbsp; i hit a large bucket today at the range, and i felt fine.&nbsp; i think thursday is still a realistic target for playing at least 9 holes.&nbsp; i got home and got on AIM, and i guess chee is staying at her sisters boss house, so i got to talk to the boss' daughter, naomi.&nbsp; we talked for about 3 hrs straight, she is one of the most fascinating people i have ever talked to...plus she is a huge college football fan (i am in heaven!).&nbsp; after dinner i decided to rearrange my room according to the plan i drew up in my mind last night while trying to get to sleep.&nbsp; moving the stuff is kind of hard by yourself, but i managed.&nbsp; it didnt turn out quite like i was hoping, but it looks pretty good imo.&nbsp; i just needed a change.&nbsp; that took about 2 hrs, so now i am at the computadora again.&nbsp; i just discovered paul van dyk, another trance artist kind of like dj tiesto.&nbsp; this genre is pretty new to me, but if all trance is like this, wow is all i can say.&nbsp; incredible stuff.&nbsp; where would music be w/out scandinavians?&nbsp; (i am swedish-ish so i can say this w/out being racist)&nbsp; i need to go out and continue our tradition or something.&nbsp; i actually talked to chad about bringing back our band (retalliation of the lamp...i guess its more or less trance now that i think about it), so im going to call lucarse when he gets back from soccer camp.&nbsp; yes, and then we can tour the world while were at it :) 'thank you, goodnight' -all star united, as well as probably a lot of other people

      last night i went to bed around midnight but didnt end up sleeping until 4:20.&nbsp; so i got some thinking done.&nbsp; i was looking around my room for paper, and i came across a notebook that i wrote in last time this happened.&nbsp; i enjoyed reading it, so i decided to post them.&nbsp; keep in mind that i had just finished reading a 1000 page book about the last 500 years of society and civilization and how we are at the end of an age (called 'from dawn to decadence' by jacques barzun, very slow read, but fascinating), so these might reflect on that.&nbsp; its basically just observations. machiavelli's 'might makes right' (this might have actually been nietzche, not sure) makes truth arbitrary. as long as God is the standard of truth, i see no problem with this.&nbsp; although truth is within God, i see no problem with saying God defines truth by defining Himself. &nbsp; tradition is undervalued in society.&nbsp; people want only to preserve themselves, not themselves in relationship to others, which is what tradition is. &nbsp; spending a half-hour a day smiling when you dont feel like it will do you more good than all the money in the world. (not sure about that one) &nbsp; if people say that shorthand caused the death of penmanship, i would argue that it creates a written language all its own. &nbsp; neatness is not necessarily having an appearance of utter cleanliness, but more a knowledge as to the whereabouts of any involved object at any given time. &nbsp; randomness is never really random at all, at least pertaining to humans.&nbsp; rather it is spawned from a desire to be separate from the expected, and, more importantly, an all-encompassing view of the expected. &nbsp; an understanding of the entire self is impossible.&nbsp; when you search for&nbsp;a cretain facet of yourself, you rarely find it, but instead learn many unexpected things. &nbsp; there are more, but they arent&nbsp;that interesting to me.&nbsp; im not sure how i feel about all of these now, but i thought that they were at least worth posting.

      I CAN HIT A GOLF BALL AGAIN!&nbsp; yes!!! according to the calendar it has only been 13 days since i could last do this, but it seems like months.&nbsp; i cant tell you how ecstatic i was.&nbsp; i was in the backyard working on my backswing with my dad and he said, 'why dont you try a slow weight shift and see how it feels', so i did, and it felt fine.&nbsp; i then worked up to a full hard swing, and that didnt hurt either, so i went to the range immediately and hit a bucket of balls.&nbsp; i was a little rusty, but that was to be expected.&nbsp; my goal is to hit every day this week and hopefully i can play a full round by thursday.&nbsp; this feels like my whole summer has been reborn.&nbsp; plus i found out tryouts are a week later than i thought they were, so optimism is permeating my being (not usually the case). that was in the evening.&nbsp; the rest of my day sucked.&nbsp; i slept in and when i got up, i read some more hunchback of ND.&nbsp; then i went to the library to see if some cds i wanted to burn were in yet.&nbsp; however, when i got there, i felt extremely nauseous.&nbsp; i left and flew home just in time to throw up in my own toilet.&nbsp; i went through 3 series of this, which was accompanied by a throbbing headache.&nbsp; it was one of those situations where, although you know you will get better pretty soon, you are so miserable that you wish you were dead. at chads yesterday, we ordered out some indian food, which looked nasty, but i figured it was ok to eat.&nbsp; i am blaming this for my illness.&nbsp; after being sick, i took a nap for a couple of hours, and i feel pretty good now, but i am taking it easy, and im going to go to bed early tonight. another good thing about today (this was actually like 2 AM this morning, which i guess counts as today) is that i downloaded a couple more sweet songs.&nbsp; my new 'repeat for a week until i get sick of it' song is 'last train home' by lostprophets.&nbsp; i heard this on the radio like a month ago, so&nbsp;i decided to get it, and it is sweet.&nbsp; the other song i got is 'ocean avenue' by yellowcard.&nbsp; my friends are obsessed with the band, so i checked them out.&nbsp; not a particularly original sound, but i like the sound anyway, so it was another good find/whatever you call it.

      i enjoyed watching todd hamilton win the british open, its hard not to be happy for someone like him.&nbsp; i would have liked to have seen phil win (i am not a bandwagon fan, he has been my favorite ever since when i was 6, my 1st visit to the memorial tournament, when i found out he was a lefty (like me)-just for the record), but anyway, hamilton held up very very well.&nbsp;i cant imagine how nervous he was when els was birdieing everything at the end.&nbsp; but how does this major record look:masters: 1stus open: 2ndbritish o: 3rdat the beginning of the yr, would you have said that belongs to phil mickelson?&nbsp; any guesses on what he will get at the pga?&nbsp; i will say 4th, just for patterns sake :)after watching the playoff, i went to get my suit for senior pics.&nbsp; no armani, but it is nice enough.&nbsp; i can pick it up tuesday after alterations.&nbsp; im not overly excited for the pics, but it has to be done.&nbsp; i think they will turn out ok (hopefully).after this i went over to chads and helped him hook up a new computer and install stuff on it.&nbsp; aim wont work though, bc of some stupid popup blocker.&nbsp; we didnt really do anything, just messed around and talked (mainly about his vacation).&nbsp; it was nice to see him again (not like i ever go more than a week w/out seeing him).&nbsp; i was going to go to youth group at heritage with the youngs, but they didnt have it this week.&nbsp; pity...i wanted to play in the tournament tomorrow, but my parents wont let me.&nbsp; its probably for the best, as i would embarass myself, but i really want to start again!&nbsp; i should stop posting these gripes, but its what is currently going on in my mind, so i guess i wont :)&nbsp; i believe thats all ive got for now!"follow the day and reach for the sun!"-the polyphonic spree (light and day) seriously, this is the coolest song ever! at least for the next week until i get sick of it.&nbsp;

      people are finally coming back from vacation!  chad got back last night from the carribean, and cody and phil just got back from nc.  keith is done with his fair (i guess he is the #4 western rider in the country!  did not know that...).  and then, a big surprise, my friend from elementary school that left in 6th grade to florida has moved to louisville, so we are going to do something soon.  maybe a reds game b/c thats kind of in between.  this is quite exciting, i havent seen him in about 4 yrs :) so now i can stop sitting around moping about the ankle (its getting better i think, but i still cant do a full swing).  i got invited to the final "championship" tournament for the league that im in on monday.  i guess its only for the top people in the league, so im not sure why i was invited (oh wait, the league kind of sucks), but i cant go anyway.  what a pity... :) last nights thing at church went well enough.  austin was there, and he remembered me.  there was a little drama between he and a girl there who was listening to hilary duff on headphones and let out random shrieks a lot (very high on the unintentional comedy scale).  the tension was eventually diffused, so the night was altogether enjoyable. i forced myself out of bed this morning so i could watch some of the british open.  it honestly wasnt that interesting to watch.  i was glad to see phil and tiger making moves.  i used to hate tiger, but i feel kind of bad for him now (plus he signed 2 autographs for me at the memorial tournament).  sidenote: todd hamilton (the leader after 3 rounds) i actually picked him for fantasy golf during the us open.  grr...wrong tournament.  that really isnt that relevant... i have read about the first 100 pgs of hunchback of notre dame.  talk about a slow starting story...after the first 30 pages it picks up, but i was worried.  another annoying thing is that there are about 5 other languages interjected into the book, and i only remotely know one of them (french).  but it is getting more interesting as the story progresses. well, i am going to early church tomorrow so i can see more of the open, so goodnight!

      (that means obligatory/compulsory) (which means it seems to be what youre supposed to do)  as i blog surf at times, i notice a lot of "100 facts about me" posts, so i figured i would go for it.  enjoy  1. i am already intimidated by this 2. i am pretty shy unless i feel comfortable 3. i despise small talk 4. i can honestly say that i like all music (except country, which imo doesnt qualify as music) 5. i actually do believe that track is a sport (sorry cody) 6. i think going to the movies w/ friends and doing nothing else is a waste of time 7. i think that college football and nfl are 2 completely different sports (w/ college vastly superior) 8. there is not 1 team in ncaa football that i do not hate other than ohio state.  honestly, i have gone over this many different ways. 9. i get bit by mosquitoes more than anyone i know 10. i have difficulty saying no to other peoples requests 11. i have noticed that by saying yes, good things happen (usually) 12. i am a bigger tipper than either of my parents 13. this is b/c i know what it is like to have a job that depends on tips 14. this is also b/c i dont have a mortgage to pay 15. i absolutely love going to rock concerts 16. my first time crowd surfing was the most exhilarating experience i have ever had (until i got dropped) 17. i believe everything happens for a reason 18. if you keep an open mind and have perspective, you can usually get an idea of this reason pretty easily 19. this saves you time by cutting self-pity significantly 20. i should listen to my own medicine 21. i cannot live with myself when someone is mad at me 22. i have only had one person in my life absolutely abhor me 23. it was a middle school teacher 24. one day in class, i was kidding around with my friends and quoted some Bible verse about humility.  she walked up behind me, and said "why dont you practice what you preach, mr. nordman?" 25. i still have no idea why she hated me 26. i have difficulty accepting complements 27. i feel that by accepting complements (about my intelligence mainly) i am taking credit for that which i did not do b/c God made me this way 28. then when i say "its a gift from God" or something like that, i feel corny and kind of rude as well 29. i guess there are worse dilemmas in the world 30. i am getting a little stressed about college applications starting soon 31. i have not yet been motivated to start this stuff 32. once i get motivated i should be fine 33. except for the interviews 34. i hope that the interviews are not phone, b/c i hate talking on the phone other than w/ friends 35. i already did a phone interview w/ an MIT guy, and i spent an hour listening to him talk about cryogenic freezing research. 36. i felt like an idiot after i hung up, b/c i was not impressive, i am sure 37. i dont think i will have to worry about going to MIT now 38. my mom saw my senior schedule and told me what she could remember 39. it appears quite difficult 40. my 1st semester is govt/econ, h. calculus, Bible, study hall, internship 41. that will be my 1st study hall ever 42. semester 2 is h. physics, french 4, h. english 12, Bible, and something else 43. i am glad i am a fast reader 44. i am proud of myself i made it so far w/out mentioning golf 45. oops, i just did 46. (this was obviously pre-planned, since i could have deleted that) 47. most people dont get my sense of humor until they know me for about 3 months 48. it is very dry and fairly sarcastic 49. i like it, but the drawback is that people never believe you when youre actually serious 50. i wish that i could vote this year 51. i missed out by less than 2 months 52. this means i wont be able to vote for a president until i am 21. 53. i guess 1 vote probably doesnt matter 54. that is just a fact, not some unpatriotic statement deserving of execution on a basis of treason 55. my number 1 pet peeve is apostrophe misuse 56. this is ironic as i never use apostrophes on this blog 57. i guess it is the ignorance as related to the misuse, like putting an apostrophe in "visit one of our store's" (actually seen at sportmart at sawmill) 58. another annoyance is people finishing my sentences constantly 59. the people that do this actually do not know what i want to say 60. actually this is more or less one person that does this 61. obviously it is not less than one person 62. i like to find humor in little things and ironies 63. i often wonder why gangsta rap has any appeal to suburban white kids, but it does 64. my friend went to maine, and apparently most of the teenagers there are kind of like b-rad in malibus most wanted 65. they call themselves "maineacs" 66. i can bluff really well when it comes to whether or not i have seen something like a tv show/movie 67. all you have to do is pick up little details/scenes from previews/commercials and throw them into a conversation, and nobody will suspect that you havent seen it 68. this is what i did w/ malibus most wanted 69. it works, doesnt it? 70. my dream career would be an investment banker on wall st 71. this is not what i had in mind in kindergarten 72. back then i wanted to be a carpenter, a pga pro, and somebody who goes around in a mickey costume at disneyworld 73. i dont think any of those dreams will come to fruition 74. i am completely fine with that 75. i am glad that i was more or less oblivious to pop culture during the 80s 76. everything about that decade seems hideous 77. that is another music "style" i dont like, i guess (80s stuff, like journey...shudder) 78. i do however like livin' on a prayer by bon jovi ('86) 79. that is it though. 80. i think that the "best of the 80s, 90s, and today" radio stations might as well be "best of classical, rap, and heavy metal" stations for all the similarities in the 3 genres. 81. i consider myself to be very introspective 82. i would be willing to bet that this is a common sentiment among teenagers 83. this is b/c introspection is part of "finding your identity" which is what all teenagers have to do 84. i like to think of "introspection" as an "introduction to inspection" which means its the first time you have seriously thought about anything of consequence 85. there are obviously exceptions to this, but its a general rule 86. another thing that i dislike immensly is the whole feminist movement 87. i am all for equal rights/pay/etc, but the rest of the movement is such a joke. they have such a chip on their shoulders, its annoying.  the "us v. the world" attitude is not going to win much support imo 88. they believe that they are better than men, which kind of discredits their whole position, that of gender equality 89. i just thought of that last one :) 90. i had another good one, but i forgot it 91. i always sing along with my radio when i am driving alone 92. i also sing when my friends are in the car with me 93. this seems to annoy them 94. i cannot wait to get away from ohio and go to college 95. my life here is fine, i just want to go live on my own and kind of start over 96. this is why i swear to myself that i wont go to ohio state (that plus the fact that its huge) 97. i will not however stay away from ohio stadium for the rest of my life (or the rest of columbus for that matter) 98. whenever i pass it on the freeway (315) i salute it (completely serious) 99. i can give you 100 reasons why OSU-michigan is the #1 rivalry in sports (if i remember, this will be my top 5 blog for michigan week) 100. i did this whole thing in 1 sitting! ha 101. not all of these were actually about me...youve been scammed! :)  that is it, hopefully you know a little more about me (other than "this is an awkward subject") :) a quick golf clap for paul casey and thomas levet who share the british open lead (probably not the case by the time you read this).  believe it or not, levet was in that playoff in the open 2 yrs ago when ernie els won.  so he can play. casey might have been ryder cup for the brits, not sure on that (i dont care that much, so i wont look it up...for now) tomorrow i am helping out with the disabled kids at church.  hopefully austin is there :) unfortunately, we always play kickball or soccer over there, and i cant do that.  we can figure something out.  goodnight!

      actually its just me.  i am an army of one...sorry. ironically i just got another solicitation from the army today.  i guess they havent noticed that i have never responded to them.  i can think of a good way for bush to cut military spending a little...stop sending this stuff out! i finished rebecca today...over 200 pages.  when i get going, i dont stop.  it got so much better over the last half of the book.  the first half is kind of dull b/c it is all setup, but i think that its all necessary.  very very riveting finish, although the ending (last page only) is disappointing.  i will now recommend it to the majority of the populace.  next up is the hunchback of notre dame.  i think i saw a wishbone about this before (actually i know i did).  it shouldnt take very long. just got a new job today.  once my ankle heals, i am going to go pass out fliers/flyers (not sure on spelling, at least i can be half right)  for my neighbors computer something or other business (once i get more info, i can solicit customers for him on my blog :))  $10 an hr, plus good exercise (sounds kind of like single bag caddying, except i know that i will be working every time i try). not much else to say, except that i have once again dug out relient ks sophomore release (the anatomy of the tongue in cheek) and it is still incredible (for more on this subject, please see my top 5 blog.) thundercats, whoah!

      i am not really in a posting mood tonight.  i am very tired, which makes me grumpy/irritable, which i have been tonight.  i did in fact get ncaa football 2005 today (a dumb purchase since i will have to get 2006 next year in preparation for college), and it is a very incredible game.  the sound is so much better, there is no comparison.  there are other new things, like actual sports illustrated covers for dynasty, plus "greatest game" scenarios ('97 rose bowl, '03 fiesta bowl, who won both of them?  thats what i thought :)  the only dumb thing is that both of those you are supposed to beat ohio state.  the anti-buckeye sentiment pops up again (this is a theme among the buckeye faithful that will be mentioned a lot more as football season approaches...wow, less than 2 months, that just hit me (trembling with anticipation)).  the one annoying thing (this will turn into more than 1, trust me) is that the playbook changed, and i was so used to 2003, so it is a bit confusing.  also it is always kind of hard to learn a new game, so it can be frustrating.  all of this paragraph to say that i like the game very much.  if you like college football (who couldnt?) get it. i did in fact get to go chip at the driving range today.  i got a small bucket and went through it a few times until my ankle started to hurt a little, and then i left the balls there (biggest waste of $4.50 ever).  also contributing to my early departure was an old guy that was chipping from a pot bunker directly across from me.  very disconcerting.  i did however develop a new shot, a low spinner that you bank into a hill of rough just in front of the green.  this is a pretty common shot, but i have never tried it before.  i got it to become somewhat effective, just need to practice more... i had a big scare today.  my dad noticed that fluffy jr. (one of my goldfish) was belly up in my fishbowl, but when he tapped it, he came to.  he seems to be fine now (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc), but that scared me to death, and put me in a worse mood.  my fish are almost 3, which is pretty old i believe.  i know death is inevitable, but i have grown quite attached to them.  every time a pet dies, i swear i wont get another one, but i always do. speaking of the british open, i guess it starts in about 2 hrs.   urlLink here is a convenient link to the leaderboard. . i dont think i have any more post in me.  i have to go rest up so i can go do nothing tomorrow.  stupid ankle...

      not sure why i am even posting anything now, probably just out of habit i guess.  the allstar game kind of sucked, as it was never really a game.  it was cool to see the AL hit for the cycle in the 1st inning, thats about it.  since it wasnt really worth watching, i watched outback jack (speaking of not really worth watching).  it was at least better than other "love" reality shows like the bachelor crap.  they use the hanging suspense stuff way too much though.  it doesnt work as well when its that blatantly obvious (another good example: the davinci code-of course i would say that book sold ok-i still find it insulting to my intelligence). other than my fascinating tv watching, nothing much happened today, so thats about all i have to post.  no great insights either, and most importantly: no obsessive compulsive thing i have to talk about here!  except listening to my new 'repeat' song-"light and day" by none other than the polyphonic spree.  their new album just came out (together were heavy), trust me it is incredible.  listening to a song on repeat is not obsessive compulsive (henceforth OC, i am sick of typing that)...right?  yeah... sidenote: i love whoever invented ace bandages!  the most comfortable form of support i can find, and a lot cheaper too.  that about covers it...goodnight!

       urlLink here is a link to my new top 5 blog.  (there is also a link on the sidebar). i did basically nothing today other than get my haircut.  i read about 100 pages of rebecca, which is becoming, to my horror, actually enjoyable.  i am borderline recommending it.  life is kind of boring when i cant golf, plus most of my friends are on vacation this week (this always happens, they go different places, but all at the same time...its a conspiracy).  i played ncaa football 2003 for the first time in almost a year i think.  i realized it was set on "jv" (very easy) when i ran the opening kickoff back for a td. i think 2005 comes out this week, and i am somewhat inclined to go get it.  i should sleep on it. i think i am going to head out to the range tomorrow to chip if nothing else.  i might try a few swings if i feel up to it. thats about all i have to post for today.  i am going to go watch the allstar game in a bit (go AL! since the tigers are going to make good use of home field advantage when they make the world series...a little baseball humor there).  i might post again later tonight, just wait and see!

      just an update on my basic blog format: i have created a separate blog for my top 5.  i will still update it every sunday, and i can put a link to it on this page.  i did this so it would be easier to access all of the archives of top 5 posts so you can be enlightened faster :)  if this completely angers you and would cause you to boycott this blog, feel free to comment, but i probably wont listen anyway. -later

      in case you hadnt noticed i updated my profile to include this among my interests.  anyway, i decided to check out my last question (find a word from A G O S) in the handy dictionary and i answered my own question again!  wow, who needs other people when you have yourself...everybody.  so...the word is:  SAGO \'sa-(,)go\ n: a dry granulated or powdered starch prepared from the pith of a sago palm ad used in foods and as testuile stiffening (with thanks to our friends at webster)  how on earth am i supposed to know that this is a word?  just thought i would update you on this so you arent kept up all night fretting about this. p.s. the british open (apparently now "the open championship" starts thursday! :')  let us hope for a successful title defense by the local boy ben curtis!  sidenote:  i play at his familys course all the time, and i got to hold and kiss the claret jug last year!  quite the experience...i have pics but they arent digital.  in case you were wondering.  now that i have peace of mind, off for some more physical therapy...this post was longer than i meant it to be.  anyhow, good night!

      yes this is the title of the song i was looking for last post.  once i posted i thought 'why dont i just look for myself?', and lo and behold, i found it in about 1 minute (google search for "hp commercial" + pictures).  it is called "pictures of you" by none other than the cure (i knew it sounded familiar).  i actually found it on some message board about commercials...did not know of such things...no further comment.  anyway, its a pretty old song, but it is very catchy...hp gets great songs for its commercials, there is another one that i like, i am not going to search for it bc there arent any words to search for, but someone in the marketing dept deserves a raise (no my dad does not work there). went to the doctor today, he confirmed that it is a severe sprain, and that the earliest i could hit balls is in about a week, which would leave me with about 2 weeks to get into peak form for the beginning of the season...i wish this wasnt going to be my senior year bc i dont want to go out on a negative.  who knows, maybe it wont be, but 2 weeks without golfing is not helpful at all.  if i had to be injured, i would almost rather it be right before season so i would have a tangible excuse for the inevitable regression of my game that will occur (sorry about the bout of verbosity, i have to warm up for school coming up fairly soon...ack).  anyway, i would like to go chip and putt at the driving range maybe starting weds or thurs, who knows.  this is really making my summer more difficult than what i had planned.  my game seemed to be coming around, too...yes, i am quite despondent here.  its just that i have done the exact same thing every summer since after 8th grade (golf/caddy more or less every day and get about 100 rounds in each yr), and i really enjoyed that whole routine, especially now that i can drive.  now i have to otherwise entertain myself, and the only big positive is that i can sleep in.  i really hope that some higher purpose for this incident manifests itself soon, bc i am kind of annoyed about my situation. tomorrow i go to get my pre-senior pictures haircut.  thankfully i got my mom to schedule it about 2 weeks (a common time period for this post) before pics, bc i absolutely hate how i look for about a week after my haircut.  i guess that is pretty common actually.  speaking of senior pics, i have to go get a suit soon...i am plugging for armani! (what do you mean, $400 could be better spent on college?...) in addition to finding that song by the cure, another band i stumbled upon today (w/ a new release) was the polyphonic spree.  its kind of a rock group with a 20ish person choir.  very unique sound.  i had heard one song "light and day" before, but i didnt know who it was.  i absolutely love them... urlLink check them out, you can listen to most of their songs on their website . i read a good chunk of "rebecca" today (summer reading requirement) and it has gotten more interesting than the beginning.  its obviously written by a woman (not meant as degradation, i just noticed quite a few details/sentiments/other fantasies that no man i know would think of let alone write.  i will let you know how it progresses. one more thing:  if anybody can tell me a word made up of the letters A G O S, i would be grateful.  i cannot come up with the word at all, i even wrote down all 24 possible combinations, and none of them seem like words to me.  i am obviously missing something, and this will bother me until i figure it out.  help?? until tomorrow...

      what to post, what to post?  i wont bore you with all of my ankle information like health updates/rehab endeavors/etc, as that seems to be an oft mocked activity of the older set.  i am going to go see a doctor tomorrow to see what i should be doing to help it as well as to find out when i can start golfing again (within a week, please!).  if i am able to caddy anytime soon, i would assume that it would just be single bagging, which is hardly worth it, honestly.  this would make for a very down year financially for me.  i think i need to get a job with set hours instead of spending 3 hrs a day wishing i could do something to get paid.  on the other hand, $120 for 4.5 hrs work is very good money for a 17-year old.  on the first hand, i can only caddy about 3 months out of the year...quite the dilemma.  i will get back to you on this as soon as i get back to myself first. as i watched the trading spaces special tonight (quite interesting, especially finding out frank is married...to a woman) i found myself wondering what happened to vern.  he was my favorite designer on the show, but they didnt profile him, and i havent seen him on any new shows in quite a while.  does anybody know if he quit or left or anything?  that would disappoint me quite a bit. another thing that was brought to my attention at camp had to do with movies.  an 8-year old kid spent half the camp talking to me about dodgeball and all the disgusting stuff like the pizza and the pump thing that ben stiller used (in addition to michael jacksons escapades).  i asked him when he saw it, and he said he went to it with his dad.  honestly people, there is a reason these movies have ratings on them!  an 8-year old should not be seeing this stuff and getting their minds screwed up by this (although its completely fine for a 17-year old...hmm, this will probably be my "lying in bed, cant get to sleep thought of the night" as i turn it over in my mind, which is something i do a lot).  anyway, i just wonder why some people dont take this stuff into consideration when they are shocked that little 15-year old junior gets an std or something.  they are getting this stuff fed to them from early childhood.  just a preachy opinion of mine to mull over if you wish.  actually, i havent fully considered this topic, so i am still open to changing my stance. one more thing:  a couple of months ago, there was a commercial for hp where there were kind of action photos and then photos were added to parts of them but they still fit (not much of a description, i know).  anyway, there was a song that had something to do with pictures, something like "the picture was all that i knew", along those lines.  that was an awesome song, but i cant find it, and i want to get that song or cd.  if anybody knows what it was, please please tell me.  i will be forever indebted to you as well, so you will have got that going for you.  i am off to do more therapy...ever try writing the alphabet in capital letters with your big toe 10 times a day?  i hope not, bc it definitely sucks.  goodnight!

      yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5.  this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this.  about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite "department" of the blog.  without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: "things i heard the most at camp"  5) "hows it going, hoppy?"    according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg.  to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm.  since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly.  it could be worse i guess.  4) "hows the ankle?"    pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) "i have to pee"    to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys.  we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed.  my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'.  peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) "my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)"    as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else.  some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true.  another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents.  these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff... 1) "what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?"    imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground.  i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that.  humility is a good thing...  there you have it.  i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces!  (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay)  some of the designers on the other hand...

      yes, i am now back from my counseloring?  experience at summer camp, and it was good for the most part.  however, it was a lot different than i had envisioned it being.  about 3 hrs into the camp i sprained my ankle (and, even though about 200 people already asked me how, i will tell you anyway...we were on a playground, and i was going down a slide with some of the kids.  it wasnt very slippery, so i got stuck at the bottom.  this was not a big problem, so i hopped off the slide from about 1 foot off the ground, but i rolled my ankle when i landed, and i heard a really loud pop.  i tried to walk it off for a few seconds, but it hurt too much, so i just flopped on the ground and had somebody get the nurse.  i tried hopping back, but it was kind of far, so i ended up piggybacking on jordan (another counselor type) to the nurses office(yes, i owe you one, shut up :) ).  anyway, i went to the ER and i got crutches and an air cast, and i felt good enough to stay (even though i couldnt put any pressure on it, i didnt want to disappoint my kids).  let me tell you, a summer camp in the woods with a bunch of hills and steps is not the place to have to use crutches.  they are fun to play with, but they suck when you need to use them.  i saw myself in a mirror for the first time since tuesday, and i have all of these bruise marks around my armpits from them.  stupid crutches...  i think my injury could have been a lot worse, especially with the pop i heard.  i thought it was a ligament, which would require surgery, and since i could not move my foot at all, it was quite possible.  personally, and you dont have to agree, but i believe that God healed me enough that i would be able to stay.  i figured that there would be a reason that it had happened to me, and it turns out that there was.  one girl was homesick, so the director had me talk to her, and she ended up staying and having a good time. other than that, camp was awesome.  i was worried that the kids wouldnt warm up to me immediately, but they loved me (always a good feeling :) ), and they listened to me for the most part.  i was planning on messing around with them and running around a lot, but i obviously couldnt very well, but that opened some doors for more personal interaction.  i taught some of them how to play euchre (kind of...they still dont get following suit...thats like the easiest concept in the game...they got the whole bauer thing).  they all helped me with my crutches and held doors and whatnot, and when i got back from ER late at night, austin (the autistic one that i was supposed to help) had put a pillow and sheet on a spare bunk as a bed for my crutches.  i was quite touched. the kids got along pretty well.  they were kind of annoyed with austin bc he made a lot of noises and so forth at night which kept them awake, but they didnt really understand him that well, which is to be expected.  if you can understand him, he is just the sweetest kid...as you can imagine with 3rd grade boys, the expulsion of gas is quite the hilarity.  one night somebody did this when we were at a campfire, and everyone started falling over themselves laughing.  then austin said "i bet Jesus is up there laughing in heaven!"  it kind of made me wish i was a dad in a way.  there was only one other major conflict in the cabin, sort of an alpha-male thing that was never really resolved, only dissuaded, but i guess that can be expected as well.  i just cant explain how much i loved interacting with the kids and how they accepted you unconditionally and how i was kind of like their hero.  it felt really good.  i guess they are still at the age when authorities in their lives are still figures to be looked up to.  i was surprised how often they were bragging about dads/grandpas/whoever being incredible in some form.  i guarantee that in 4 or 5 years they will be complaining about how annoying/stupid they are...such is life. my body is kind of beat up (not just my ankle).  my armpits are bruised, my shoulders are sunburnt, i have a million (give or take) mosquito bites, and my back is quite itchy.  throw in 2 brief showers and no shampoo over 5 days and a bath becomes quite appealling (sp?...i am tired).  sorry, i had to complain about this...anyway, it was more than worth it though.  i made some new friends among the counselors (even though i already knew them), and they were all really nice even though my injury was a bit of an inconvenience.  so yes, i thoroughly enjoyed camp.  at the end, my counselor asked me if i would do this all over again, and i said without a doubt. the one negative now is that i am going to be kind of bored until the ankle heals somewhat, as i cant golf or caddy right now.  i had to cancel mondays tournament.  the golf season starts in about 3 weeks, so i have to get better in about a week if i want to have any chance to get in good form...this kind of sucks.  at least i can finish some summer reading.  i will probably be posting more jewels about camp over the next week or so, as this is quite the long post and i forgot a lot of the stuff i wanted to write.  i will close with another "austin one-liner". somebody else was making up a story or something, so he said,   "liar, liar, plants for hire!"  kids say the darnedest things!

      actually that is tomorrow.  false alarm... the tournament today went ok.  the course was pretty short (cumberland trail, not cumberland like i said last post), but it was tough.  a lot of of fairway bunkers (trust me, i would know) and the greens were annoyingly fast (i believe 12 on the stimp or so...very very fast to the casual golfer such as myself).  so i limped home to an 88, which was good enough for 4th place.  the field was a bit stronger this week, and 77 won it.  it was very hot and not cloudy AT ALL during the round (this will come into play soon). after this round i wanted to go see if i could get rid of my golfers tan (very abrupt lines just above elbows and knees, around feet, right wrist (golf glove and matching rubber band line), neck, sunglasses, and a less noticable one across the forehead from my hat) at the pool, so i went over to chads house to go to the pool at medallion.  of course it was a perfect day for tanning as the sun was nothing if not stifling and generally hot during golf.  however, during the 4 or 5 minute drive to the pool, the weather went from sprinkling to torrential downpour with sheets of rain and no visibility at 30 mph.  so we turned around and just hung out for a while.  about an hour later it was clear again...stupid ohio weather...so we got to go to the pool for a couple of hours.  thankfully i didnt see anyone i knew.  i am still going to be quite pale at camp (2-3 hrs of pool time every day...ack). not much else to say, i will not be able to post probably until saturday or sunday...aha!  i just watched william hungs video for 'we are the champions'!  good stuff...i think he has gotten a little bit better, but he kind of sucks...i feel really bad for him.  i am all for some patronizing, but people usually know when i am messing with them.  to be so naive is quite remarkable.  he sure isnt going broke though...only in america i guess.  have a wonderful week, and develop some coping methods to deal with my absence early in the week as opposed to late...sorry :)

      i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings.  this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one.  with that in mind, the first category is...music albums!  these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums.  as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence.  without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay    i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto    this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about.  the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me.  who says the london club scene is weak?  i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground    another incredible techno/trance album.  this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing.  the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods "God bless the usa")  anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks.  the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k    this is the most diverse album up here.  they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you).  i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well.  the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead    how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway).  3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album.  the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old.  karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place).  kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5.  if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).

      228 years...thats getting up there i say.  i wonder how many more years we have in us, i mean every great nation eventually collapses.  i would think that this wont come anytime soon, but in 150 or 200 years, will we still be as dominant as we are today?  i think outsourcing is going to hurt us a lot more than most people realize.  i hope that the tax incentives (if there are any) for keeping business in the country will be increased, bc this could really get out of hand.  i think labor in india is something like 5 or 10 times cheaper than in america.  why would any businessman keep his factory in america in those circumstances?  i think the government needs to do something about this.  anyway, there is my cheery, hopeful birthday wish to america.  honestly, i love this country and there is no way i would want to live anywhere else.  darn it, i am proud to be an american! i caught the last halfish of legend of bagger vance on abc last night.  i had heard it wasnt good so i never saw it, but i actually liked it.  one quote that really hit home was "golf is a game that cannot be won, only played".  i think thats why i like golf so much, and also why i am sick of competitive golf (about 3 more months!)  i think that, at least for me, the competition brought into golf by tournaments and high school matches kind of defeats the purpose of golf by making the competition with other people instead of yourself.  i am surprised at how excited i am for next summers golfing just bc i know i will be able to golf without any pressure and i will be able to just have fun.  the reasons i am not leaving the team in the first place are 1) my teammates are awesome 2) we have a great shot to win states, and 3) i guess i would feel like i was quitting on myself and everyone else as well.  so i will drag myself to tryouts in about a month and see where things go from there...speaking of competitive golf, i have another tournament tomorrow...at cumberland gc.  i have no idea where that is, so i am going to go mapquest it.  enjoy grilling/fireworks/whatever tonight!

      yes, i am pretty sure those are actually fireworks outside thomas, but it sounds like gunfire (or maybe thunder).  red white and boom was pretty cool.  i went with cody chad and brad.  we ran into robby and his "ladies".  we also met some girls who kept asking us for cigarettes.  i guess it turned out that brad knew one of them so we hung out with them for awhile.  interesting people...we also watched a parade, where i found out that they only give candy to little kids.  even the political candidates in the parade do this, which doesnt make sense since the little kids cant vote.  i still got a "stress relief ball" from dominion homes (the best of everything), so i am happy :)  the actual fireworks were pretty good, and we beat most of the traffic out.  then we went to codys house where we stayed up playing halo and watching tape delayed wimbledon matches until about 5.  quite happy to see sharapova win (no, not bc she is incredibly hot...i just dont really like serena).  on a side note brad was telling me about his girlfriend from quebec that he is going to hang out with in florida next week.  i told him to tell her "tais toi", which is french for shut up, but i told him it meant i love you.  dont tell him (he will forget anyway).  i will be so proud of myself if it works :)  messing with people can be fun (to an extent). i am going against one of my principles right now and listening to a britney spears song on repeat (everytime).  i am definitely not a fan, but this song is really incredible.  it has a slight resemblance to evanessence at times.  i think they are one of the groups that will change the face of popular music (groups like genesis, creed, boy bands, duran duran as far as the last 20 yrs).  they created a unique sound; whenever i hear a new song of theirs on the radio i can always tell who it is.  more and more bands seem to be imitating them.  personally, i like this movement, there is more of a rock sound with more edge to it, while it doesnt diminish the vocals at all.  theres my musical analysis for the month (more like my whole life). ps those "fireworks" on the last post looked a lot better in the create post box than they do on the actual site.  sorry :)

      hmm...blogger is not being particularly prompt in the area of posting stuff.  i posted like 3 hrs ago and it hasnt come up yet on the site.  unlike last time i will wait and not repost which could make me feel stupid...just got back from shopping for camp stuff.  nothing terribly exciting happened, except i saw a guy with about 4 teeth total.  it was kind of disgusting, but i felt really bad from him.  i had thought columbus was kind of through with the hick image, but i guess were not done yet.  maybe he just chews tobacco a lot...very unhealthy habit might i add (plus those spit cups are completely repulsing).  just downloaded a new song called "Jesus walks" by kanye west.  it has been on power 107.5 ("columbus' hottest hiphop and r&b"), now i have probably listened to it about 10 straight times.  i try not to do that bc it makes me get sick of it, but its really good, it confronts some issues that i have kind of wondered about for a while.   urlLink heres a link to his website.  anyway, im heading downtown probably in an hour or 2.  have a great holiday weekend :)  here are some early fireworks for you:     \|/         \|/     * |/  -*-    *    -*-   * *-  /|\         /|\    * God bless america!  happy 4th

      apparently my 1st post did work, it just didnt come up when i checked it.  now you know i wasnt making it up though.  you also know that i tried to make them similar ("cup o tea").  oh well. golfed the same 9 holes twice this morning, shot 43-41.  i started off w/ 2 double bogeys bc some old guy was right behind me so i rushed.  i pride myself on being a fast golfer, so i picked it up, and i beat him to the turn by about 2 holes.  played the 1st nine in 58 minutes, which is top 5 for me.  the second time around i was even through 6 holes, then i finished bogey triple bogey.  i got stuck behind a twosome in a cart.  i waited for them on every tee from 13 to 17, but they wouldnt let me through.  of course, when i got to 18 they were like, "want to play with us?".  grr... another annoyance on golf courses is people who honk when they drive by.  its not like youre the first person to ever think about this, its not that funny.  somebody did that today when i was walking up to my ball.  what purpose does honking have then?  am i going to screw up my walking?  i guess i can see how it would be funny actually.  i still find it annoying tho. i am going to go shopping now :'( for camp.  wish me luck...

      ack! cursed blogger erased my rather lengthy post.  now i have to write it all over, and it will never be as good as it was.  here we go anyway.  today was another day consumed by golf.  i played 18 holes this morning, where i shot 83 and played fairly well, and then i had a lesson this evening which also went well.  i also finished a book called "mafia cop".  its about some guy who grew up with his family in the mafia, but he became a cop.  for someone like me who is fascinated by organized crime, it was an interesting book.  it wasnt incredibly well-written or organized, but there was a lot of 'good stuff' as i like to call it in there.  its by bob drury and louie eppolito (can you guess which one was the mafia guy?) if you want to check it out.  next on my list, unfortunately, is a book for school called "rebecca".  it looks like some sort of romance novel, which is not really my cup o tea.  i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it...not sure why it was assigned. saw spiderman 2 last night with some people from school and youth group.  it was pretty good, it had more depth than what i expected.  a little corny, and some graphics (web swinging from building stuff) were kind of weak, but overall i would give it 3.5 out of 4 stars (yes movies are out of 4 stars, not 5 like a lot of my friends think...its not a restaurant or a hotel!  very annoying...yes i am easily annoyed, sorry.  it makes me more interesting as a person...maybe...) tomorrow i am going down to red white and boom ("largest fireworks display in the midwest") with cody.  i have actually never been before.  i know there will be a squidgetload of people down there.  i am predicting i will get mugged.  who knows.  i will carry minimal cash.  thats about all ive got for now. ps: the post title is the name of an article i read somewhere.  its by a harvard professor, so its obviously not conservatively biased.  its an interesting objective view.  im not taking sides on this,  urlLink but here is a link if you want to read it.   have a great friday :) and be safe this holiday weekend as an excessive amount of coppage is expected to be present (aka the po-po).  there you have it, i can use ebonics as well as the next guy.  there, now i am really done.

      another day consumed by golf is under the belt...i got up early this morning and played 18 (shot 83, so i was happy enough), then i had a lesson this evening which went pretty well).  i also spent a few hours reading a book called "mafia cop", about some guy who grows up with his family in the mafia, but he becomes a cop, yada yada yada.  for someone like me who is really fascinated by organized crime, it was an interesting book, but it wasnt especially well-written or anything.  i liked it though.  now i am going to have to read "rebecca" for summer reading for school.  it looks like some romance novel which really isnt my cup o tea...not sure why my teacher picked this book.  i guess i will just have to suck it up and read it...or i could just use sparknotes.  actually i dont think the book is popular enough to be listed.  stupid book.  :( yesterday i went to see spiderman 2 with some people from my school and youth group.  it was pretty good, although some parts (esp the ending) were a bit corny, and the special effects when spidey was swinging around were kind of weak.  it had a surprising amount of depth to it though.  i will give it 3.5 out of 4 stars (so many people i know think movies are rated out of 5 stars! ack! its not a freaking restaurant or hotel, its a movie, out of 4 stars!  this is one of my fairly irrational pet peeves, bear with me). i am going to red white and boom ("the largest fireworks show in the midwest") with cody tomorrow, so i wont be able to work.  i guess there are about 1 million people there every year, which is about as many people as there are in columbus.  where do they come from? (west virginia)...no comment on that one.  anyway thats about all ive got for the time being. ps: post title is the name of an article i read.   urlLink here is a link to it .  its by a harvard guy, so its obviously not conservatively biased.  im not taking sides on this, its just an interesting and objective article.  so there.  have a wonderful friday.

      sorry...i have a semi-interesting story to tell you.  wednesday i went golfing at medallion cc with chad (they bought a guest package for me...buy 2 rounds get 1 free...or something like that)  anyway, when we teed off, it was perfect weather, and i played ok.  i made about a 60-footer for double bogey on the 1st hole, and i ended up with a 42 with 2 birdies on the first 9 (rookery...tipped out baby!).  then we went on to preserve, where i was playing ok.  after 4 holes, chad pointed at the sky and said 'that sucks' (it was menacing, he wasnt just anti-sky or something...just to clarify). i said 'that wont hit us until the end of the 9.  so we played on.  on 5 tee, the lightning siren thing went off, but i was like 'just pretend you didnt hear it' (i am a negative influence).  so as we walk to the green, he gets out his umbrella, and i made fun of him for being a woman (obviously umbrellas arent for men), banter, etc.  then, a gust of wind blew it inside out, and i said 'see, God doesnt approve of transgenderedness' (it was funny, just go with me on this).  but wait, thats not all...he set the umbrella down to hit a chip, and it started to blow away.  then he started cracking up and fell on the ground, so i had to run it down.  it actually jumped over a fence and went onto a fairly busy road (sunbury rd for those columbus readers).  a couple of cars had to go on the opposite side of the road to avoid it before i could get to it.  needless to say, we went in after that.  unfortunately, we were literally as far away from the clubhouse as possible, so we enjoyed a 2ish mile walk in a torrential downpour.  this red crap kept squishing up through my shoe.  i still have no idea what it was, but chad thinks it was gum.  whatever it was, when i took my shoe off, my sock was covered in redness.  my mom thinks it was dye from the brown part of my shoe...who knows.  i honestly have never been that wet before other than when swimming.  i literally could not take my shirt off until it dried for about 20 minutes.  so there you have it.  if you didnt find this at least somewhat amusing, you might as well not read the rest of this blog as it is the quintessential example of my sense of humor (either that or i didnt tell the story very well).  that was more humor than you can shake a stick at.

      notice a theme with these titles?  dont worry, i wont keep doing that.  anyway, i just found out one of the most annoying things you can do (other than not tipping your caddy...cough cough).  next time you buy something cheap with cash, like mcdonalds or something, give the cashier more money than you need to.  for instance, if you get 2 double cheeseburgers and a small coke (my usual order), the total is $2.97.  so i give them a $5 and two $1, which makes absolutely no sense.  they kind of stare at the money and then go 'you gave me too much', then you say 'can i have my change then?'.  it is one of the funniest things ever (if you have a somewhat malicious sense of humor as i do. (stressing the somewhat)).  i stumbled upon this by accident, but now whenever im in a bad mood or something, this helps me out.  no i am not a complete jerk, and if you feel like condemning me (all of you people who read this), let (s)he who is without sin cast the first stone...something like that.  i honestly dont think this would offend anyone though.  now that i have made this post unfunny with my political correctness that i cant stand in other people, i shall leave.

       i have found the secret to shooting much lower scores in golf:  play the womens tees!  dont laugh...today i tipped it out on the front 9.  i hit the ball pretty well, but my wedges were going everywhere except where they were supposed to.  so i said, if i play the womens tees on the back 9, i will have a wedge into every green (at least par 4s).  so i sucked up my pride and did that.  i spent the majority of the time trying to think up tough comebacks for people who might make fun of me.  unfortunately nobody did.  actually that was probably fortunate as i couldnt think of anything other than explaining all of this, which would take way too long.  anyway, i was bogey-free on the back, and i shot a 1 under 35.  i hit a par 5 in 2 with a couple of 5-woods (3-putt par...ack!), and i had some sort of wedge into every other hole (except 11, a par 3 that i hit 9 iron on).  i figured that if people laughed at me they werent secure in their manliness, unlike me.  yeah...

      since i have not been blogging for very long, you have not realized everything that has gone into my efforts to break 80 on 18 holes over the past 2+ years since i broke 90.  today all of those struggles finally came to fruition as i made about a 5 footer for a 78 on the last hole.  i had to go 27 holes to get it, and it was HOT out today.  i think 92ish, with more or less no wind.  so i am quite happy right now.  honestly, i think i will be satisfied with my golf 'career' from now on, as i hold no expectations of breaking 70 or anything.  i am kind of busy right now, so this is a short post, but i just had to get this out there and spread the good news!

      yes, it has been awhile since i posted, as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan (my friend, who as he puts it, is from florida but happens to live in kentucky) around town...there might be something to this social stuff...i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor, or not.  i definitely wont use that phrase for awhile again. i dont think that he had changed that much, which was a huge worry i had.  i really felt sick when i was waiting for him to come.  i think he has changed somewhat, which is obviously natural, and i have also changed, even though i dont really perceive it.  so we got along pretty well, not as naturally as in elementary school or anything.  it was more like somebody from church i see 2 or 3 times a month, chemistry wise.  the thing that disappointed me was that pretty much none of his friends from 'back in the day' were available.  they were all on vacation, either that or they had some vague 'plans'...no comment.  so we ended up seeing a movie friday and saturday nights, and just hanging out.  we saw bourne supremacy friday with philip, dan, and andrew.  then ryan wanted to go to walmart for no real reason.  i dont know where any are (although i know there are some), so we settled for meijer.  he showed me how to do a 720 in a shopping cart.  i was kind of thinking 'you lived 5 minutes from the beach in florida, and this is what you did?'.  on saturday, we drove around for a couple of hours (literally) looking for his old house, which we eventually found.  then we played tennis and saw manchurian candidate with cody.  very confusing movie, but im almost positive i had seen it before, and no, it wasnt the original version...ha, it came to me...i saw a preview.  no im not completely stupid.  anyway...then we watched a street something or other, like a magician who didnt do much until the very end.  i didnt know they had those in ohio.  oh, but they do...then we hung around easton for awhile...i had no idea how ghetto it got.  i kept making stupid comments, like 'oh, theres ray allen' (i do that to people wearing jerseys...cant help it), and ryan said 'one of these days, youre going to get shot'.  it would be my honor to get shot for being dumb like that, and it might just cure me.  we went to church this morning, and after lunch at panera, he left.  i think goodbyes are so much harder when its not somebody youre going to see the next day or week.  maybe we can get together again when more people are in town...theres a lot more to tell, but this is probably kind of boring and long already. i did get a few new cds:  just be-tiesto; this is trance, vol 2-various; and ocean avenue-yellowcard.  all 3 are incredible.  the various one is like 80 minutes of continuous dance/trance mix.  i love it dearly, so much so that it will replace a rush of blood to the head (coldplay) as my new 'pre-golf' cd.  i may go over requirements for this later...ironically, one of the songs is a mix of clocks by coldplay.  i guess this genre is not for everybody, im not sure how thats possible not to like, but ryan could only take about 20 minutes of it, as it was 'driving him crazy'.  the brilliance would be lost on someone who listens to country music...ick.  anyway, i like other music too, so im not incredibly strange (at least as far as music is concerned).  but honestly, i dont see how one cant appreciate this music.  you can just immerse yourself in the driving beat and bask in the intermittent glow that is the synthesizer...(yes i am listening to that cd right now).  i picture somebody gliding through a pool and then coming up with eyes closed and smoothing their hair back in carribbean crystal blue water at dawn with a sun and sky gradually lightening during the moment of transition from night to dawn to morning to day.  but thats just me.  it makes great reading music too.  once you get into the book and the music at the same time, your reading speed is driven solely by the beats.  so when the drum and bass kicks in, i probably read double time and i still know exactly what i read.  its quite enjoyable.  of course, country people could ridicule me for not recognizing their whatnot for the masterpiece that they hold it to be...beauty is in the eye of the beholder...i hate it when i use cliches...i also hate it when i cant put accents over french words.  it defeats the purpose of using it. one other thing.  the espn/usa today coaches poll (college football) was released last week, and ohio state is #9.  i guess si said we were overrated, and candidly, i think we might be.  i mean, we lost 75% of the dline, and our punter (jts favorite play is in fact the punt), as well as qb, 3 recievers (not that the passing game was anything special).  also, aj trapasso, our only punting recruit seems to have the most legal problems this side of willie williams (ooh, how does that feel, canes fans?  oh wait there arent any real one.  ooh! im on fire!).  so i would put osu #14 or so.  bob hunter, a columbus sports columnist, wrote an article about the counterproductivity of preseason polls, and i agreed with it 100%.  so tonights top 5 will be my most overrated college football teams (no i will not put osu in there just for loyaltys sake...yes i can do that).  this post is already incredibly and annoyingly long, so i wont make it much longer.  feels good to be back!
