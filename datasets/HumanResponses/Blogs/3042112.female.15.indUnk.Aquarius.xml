      The United Live concert on Saturday night was pretty cool.  They were selling stuff there, and i bought a wristband!  Now I'm SO cool.      The Church world-wide is getting a revelation that there is a new song to sing. It's bringing the Church together, bringing unity among denominations, life and relevance to churches. People are turning their hearts to God, their focus is being renewed and they are realizing that we were created to worship God."â€”Reuben Morgan of United      There's a picture I took of it, not very good quality though, it was kinda dark in there.  And I took it with my cell phone.

      Well...today was just another boring day of my spring break.  I woke up at 1:00!!!  WOOHOO!  And I've mostly just been sitting around, cleaning my room, watching TV, doing laundry, on the computer, etc.

      So I did get another book...Stephen King -- The Shining.  It's pretty famous I think, and it looked like a good book.  Its a horror book or whatever, so it's probably gonna totally freak me out since i usally read downstairs in my room...at night...in the dark...all alone...and since my room doesn't have doors, there's the dark room next to it...and that's creepy... :-(

      Well since I hadn't read any books (other than history books and whatnot for school) for over a year, I finally decided to go to the library and get something to read.  So I got a Stephen King book, and it's really interesting.  It's called  From a Buick 8  I've only read one other book by him, but now I think I'll read some more.  I'm almost done with the book already and I just got it yesterday.  Yeah so anyways...I'm gonna get another book from the library today I think.

And I got to drive.  :oD  I went to church tonite, and that was pretty fun...took my friend Sarah home afterwards.  Well ummmm I don't really have anything else to say...it was a pretty boring day.

      Ok, I had to put this on here, I found it on a message board... it's a review of Hilary Duff's song 'come clean' I thought it was the funniest thing ever.  ok here it is.   Topic: Hilary Duff's song, "Come Clean" is POETRY. It's more poetic than The Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby"      It's true. There is so much symbolism and metaphors in Hilary's song, it's not even funny.   Here, I'll break it down for you.   It's obvious that the song is about sex, and Hilary Duff "coming" is her orgasming.     Cause perfect  Didn't feel so perfect  Trying to fit a square into a circle was no life  I defy   In this line, "trying to fit a square into a circle" is obviously buttsekz. The square is a metaphor for a penis, and the circle is a metaphor for a the anal region. A guy wants to give Hilary buttsekz, but, like the last line "I defy", she doesn't like buttsekz.     Let the rain fall down  And wake my dreams  Let it wash away  My sanity  Cause I wanna feel the thunder  I wanna scream  Let the rain fall down  I'm coming clean  I'm coming clean    "Let the rain fall down"... TRANSLATION: Ah, SKEET SKEET SKEET!!   "And wake my dreams, let it wash away, my sanity"... she likes to be awaken with sex.   "Cause I wanna feel the thunder"... well, she wants to orgasm. And she's obviously a screamer during sex, which is indicated in the line "I wanna scream"   With the line, "I'm coming clean".. she's obviously now in an orgasmic state and she wants to be cleansed with the SKEET SKEET SKEET that was noted earlier in the chorus in the line "Let the rain fall down"     Lets go back...  Back to the beginning   For some weird reason, she wants to be a virgin again... well, Hilary... don't think that will be happening again!

       Paper Mario 2    Mario Story 2 (JPN)    GameCube sequel to the unique 2.5D roleplaying game for N64. Known as Mario Story 2 in Japan, Paper Mario 2 combines turn-based battles with action elements. You select commands from a command ring atop your characters' heads, such as jumping or swinging a hammer, then have to time yourself just right to defend or pull off maximum damage. Throughout their adventure, Mario and friends find help in a few items and places. You can heal your party at an inn and purchase items at a shop, collect coins by defeating enemies, and buy new special abilities in a badge shop. Paper Mario 2 also features a lot of different mini games, such as a quiz show or the ability to control Bowser in a sidescrolling action sequence.

      So last night I babysat my little cousin...he is 3.  He's such a little cutie!  I took a couple pictures of him in his old halloween costume, he's a power ranger!          Yeah, he went to bed at 8, then i read part of my book, it scared the crap outta me.  So I watched Johnny English, talked on the phone, and played on the computer for a while.  Today we're going over to some people's house to have a passover dinner or something....hopefully there will be some good food there.

      Something just isn't right I can feel it inside The truth isn't far behind me You can't deny  When I turn the lights out When I close my eyes Reality overcomes me I'm living a lie  When I'm alone I  Feel so much better And when Im around you I don't feel  [Chorus:] Together It doesn't feel right at all Together  Together we've built a wall Together Holding hands we'll fall Hands we'll fall  This has gone on so long I realize that i need Something good to rely on Something for me  When I'm alone I  Feel so much better And when Im around you I don't feel  [Chorus]  My heart is broken I'm lying here My thoughts are choking on you my dear On you my dear On you my dear  When I'm alone I  Feel so much better And when Im around you I don't feel  [Chorus x2]  When I'm around you When I'm around you I don't feel together I don't feel together When I'm around you When I'm around you I don't feel together  I don't feel together
