      Last week (Wed 21st April 2004) we held a friendly 5-a-side mixed football tournament at work, for staff, PhD students and friends of the School of Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEGS), Newcastle University.    urlLink    Stuuuudents.   Ten teams turned up, and in total 60 people were there to play and support.  All players and supporters made a contribution to the cause, and are now official members of the Bellavista Social Club (BSC).  A total of £117 was raised.    CONGRATULATIONS to the overall winners, Young Ones (Matt, Kate, Rory, Oliver & Simon D), who were presented with the winners trophy, certificates and mystery prizes.    COMMISERATIONS to the overall losers, Hero (Lesley, Jon, Karen, Michelle and Adam), who received the coveted losers medal, certificates and mystery prizes.    THANKS to all the teams (Hero, Tripoli, No Name, Water A, Water 1, Young Ones, Toxic, Molecular Maestros, Geomatics, and Leftovers) and supporters.  Particular thanks to those who’ve hardly ever played football before.  Hope you enjoyed it.  Remarkably, there was only one serious injury and a few aching legs.    SPECIAL THANKS also to the staff at Claremont Sports Hall, David Parker for agreeing to pay for the hire (enabling money collected to go to Bellavista Juventud FC), Heather McGrath for her excellent firstaiding, Rob, Paul, Sean and Russell for being refs at short notice, and Lesley Batty for arranging the CEGS night out afterwards.    Charlotte Weatherell, 26th April 2004.

       The Bellavista Social Club   In Peru, on the banks of the Amazon, is a city called Iquitos.  In Iquitos is a small parish called Bellavista which has a local under-21 football team called Bellavista Juventud.  Presiding over the team is Father Joe Plumb, an Englishman, formerly of Ashington, Northumberland.  The side competes with other nearby teams and Father Joe is rightly proud of Juventud.  He believes that the football team isn’t just great entertainment for players and spectators alike but it also helps teach qualities as diverse as self-esteem, pride and responsibility.   In 2003, Father Joe was joined by Doug Paterson and Charlotte Weatherell who also settled quickly in the town and fell in love with the area and its people.    Their common link with Joe is Bedlington’s Benet Bicop school in Northumberland, where Joe was a regular visitor and Doug a history teacher.   During their time in Peru, Doug and Charlie put their own skills to good use.  This included putting on special classes for local  children to help them with rudimentary English.   urlLink    Charlie and Doug's students get their certificates.&nbsp; urlLink     They were made very welcome, by Joe, their pupils and the towns’ people.  And although Doug was keen to teach the children all he could.  There was nothing he could teach the football team.   That will come as no surprise to anyone who has seen Doug play.   urlLink    Doug sets off on a run down the wing and is sensibly ignored by the midfield ball winner.&nbsp; urlLink      Anyway, before too long it was time for Doug and Charlie to leave.  But not before they had handed out certificates to their pupils and made a promise that they would return.  There was also one final promise.  That they would look for sponsors for Bellavista Juventud back in their home city of Newcastle.  So it was decided that in order to help support the football team and to buy the shirts, shorts, socks and boots they needed,  a new club would be formed – the Bellavista Social Club.    Everyone brings their own special gifts to the table.  While the young men of Bellavista are tackling, dribbling and shooting, the less fit, older crowd, back in the Toon can do their bit by drinking, smoking, dancing and putting their hands in their pockets.  The first meeting of the club, including will take place at the Egypt Cottage, in Newcastle on Saturday April 17th from 7pm to midnight.  Tickets cost £5 with all profits going to the football team.

      The following inspiring message from Father Joe Plumb, President of Bellavista Juventud FC in Iquitos, was passed on by his father Bernard Plumb to Bellavista Social Club in Newcastle, at the BSC’s first event at the Egypt Cottage on 17th April 2004.    urlLink    Speech from Father of Father Joe    Things look good for the lads of Bellavista this season.  The mood is positive, the camaraderie is tangible and having a new kit and 16 pairs of boots helps us feel ready for the new season.  The team have recently won three training matches, ALL against First Division teams from the League of Iquitos.  All of the 22 players are from Bellavista itself.  We hope to wean down the team to 18 players who will make up the final squad for the 2004/5 season.  Two of the lads are ‘moto-carro’ (Iquitos-style motorbike taxi) drivers, several are still at school or studying at technology colleges or to get into the University but the majority and unemployed or rely on occasional jobs carrying cargo in the port or working as fare-collectors on buses.  About ten of the lads haven’t finished secondary education and therefore have little possibility of gaining any permanent work.    Playing football for their ‘barrio’ gives them pride in their abilities, loyalty to one another and the contributions and efforts that YOU are making show them that SOMEONE believes and shows a concern for them.    We started training in March, running each morning at 5AM and meeting at 7pm to have a knock-around at the local school’s 5-a-side pitch.  In April we’ve had three friendlies, and the good this is to see the understanding and good communication and real TEAM SPIRIT between the players when they’re on the pitch.  Mario, the physical fitness coach, is happy with the lads’ commitment and progress.  Juan Vargas, or ‘Pata Larga’ (big foot) the technical coach, is getting good results from the new players.  The ‘stars’ are Jackson and Ravi (although both are highly-strung and need to learn to control their tempers with the ref).  ‘Yucca’ in defence is a good captain and organises his team-mates well.  Our wingers Beto and Gustavo need a bit more pace and all the players could do with growing a few feet and filling out more – our main expense pre-season could be multi-vitamins and calcium supplements.  Your donations have helped us buy: •	22 shirts, shorts and socks •	22 bibs for training •	8 pairs of boots (we had 8 pairs from last season still in good condition) •	3 footballs •	2 kit bags •	inscriptions for 15 players •	photo passes for 8 members of the directive for entry to the Max Agustin Stadium in Iquitos on match days •	bandages, rub (‘ralgex’ and ‘??’)  The season starts in July and there are 12 dates … we’ll keep you posted.  Thanks for ALL your support and please, if you pray, pray that the lads give up the booze and the women, at least before match days, as at present that’s the only thing between us and promotion this season!  Enjoy the party!

        urlLink    President Doug.   Well, thanks to all those who bought raffle tickets for such quality prizes as a rubber glove! A nice £47.90 was raised for the Club at the Sixth Form A Level Drama Exam Performance (hope they all pass). A night of top quality acting with added social conscience.   Now time for some musing from me, the Club President.  The Bellavista Social Club is taking off in a way I never thought possible. We plan to have the best supported team in Iquitos Peru, although we admit there is limited competition. The lads are looking very smart in their strips and are set to  dazzle the opposition with both their footwork and their cool gear.  As for events there will be another meeting of the Club soon, keep checking in.  Think of it this way - the more we drink, dance and smoke tabs the more the lads benefit.  And the more the benefit, the better they do on the pitch.  Doug 'El Presidente' Bellavista Social Club

      Thanks to the nice people at Natwest we now have a bank account, cheques payable to The Bellavista Social Club, lots of forms later, we have a treasurer in the form of Charlotte so all enquiries to her.   Plans for the Club to hold its Christmas party are forming, suggestions from members welcome.  Had a visit from Peru, not only are the boys the best kited out team in the league but money raised means that seven are now in college or getting job training!
