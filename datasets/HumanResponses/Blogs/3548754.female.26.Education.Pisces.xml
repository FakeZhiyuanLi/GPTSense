      Went to the dentist this morning so, passed by my parish to get my baptismal certificate needed for my confirmation on July 31. Myk texted he cant make it to the meeting tonight with my "coord". He'll join next time...  I think I ate too much today. Hahahahaha! o yeah, bad news, my titA is having a threatened miscarriage. My friend just had one two. Hers was the second miscarriage. Gosh!  Got to Glorietta earlier than expected. Went around but finally got tired. Went ahead to Bon Appetit. We were actually the last ones to leave literally. Sinasabuyan na nila ng sabon yung floor, we were still there. Hehehehe. Meeting was productive. At least now I know that someone will be there para damayan ako.

      Hay! Que horror! Sobrang toxic this morning. I miss my cookie. He's still in Batangas. Later pa siya go home.  Had lunch with Kuya Chinoat Friday's in Glorietta Then he went back to the office while I ran errands for GSB. I had to buy gifts for the conference. Passed by Powerplant to but wrapper and ribbons before going to Ateneo Rockwell. Started wrapping the trivia gifts in Rockwell. Jingle asked if I could wrap the jackets as well.... oh well...was finally done at 7:30pm.   Mike called, on their way home na. They still have an 8pm dinner meeting with a client at Off the Grill in QC. I was so tired I just watched TV and slept early.

      It's my lolo's birthday!!!! Kaya lang, he's been dead since 1994. Miss him so much na....  Toxic at work but was able to squeeze in my task of calling my church to ask if there's a wedding before mine. Was able to print out also some stuff for my meeting on Tuesday with Mimoy and Apple, my newfound coordinators. Heheh.  Watched Apple's wedding last night. It was featured in Pipol in channel 2. Myk and I rushed home from 2 hours f playing badminton to catch it. Worth it. She was so happy :p  Myk's leaving for Batangas today... makikifiesta in Balayan, Batangas. i was supposed to go with them but since alangin, sila nalang ni Joey.   Time to go home now...I'm pooped...

Myk and I played baminton again Saturday night. Not as tiring that the first time...improving na. Kaya lang, nagyaya naman mag-eat si Myk after. Nyek!  Slept in late yesterday..Sunday naman eh. I've been tired the whole week. Ate and Jelu came at 2pm. By 3pm, we were pigging out on isaw, manggang hilaw with bagoong, bread and liverwurst spread. Yummy! Afterwhich, Ate ad I fell asleep with Jelu in the middle. Hehehehe. Batugan.  Good morning Monday to CCE!!! TOXIC!! Buti nalang I had to leave before lunch and buy stuff for the staff conference. I got back shortly before 3pm. Hehehhe. Got the gift tags from Kuya Chino!!!! Yey! we can start decorating the giveaways this weekend!!!! Hay, slowly, we're getting by. Kuya Chin will be printing the big tags soon.  Mimoy and Apple, my voluntary coordinators, were also asking wen to meet. Oh goody! Set meeting next week in Glorietta. Alright! help is on the way.

      Finally!!! Saturday! But would you believe, we were toxic this morning. So many materials, nameplates, directionals, etc to do in time for Monday.   Called Myk to see if he's awake na for his 12nn meeting. Maid said he's taking a bath (that's good to hear - heheheh).  My officemate's here to pick me up. I have to accompany him to pay something. I hope when we're done, Myk's done with his meeting too.

      AAAAAARRRRRGGGGG!!! Whatta day!!! I've bee alone here in the office since before lunch. They're all out on offsite. Gosh, no one to talk to... Kuya chino is sick pa...haaay.  Still no final paper for Infote. Emailed and called Charles that I'm swamped with work and I'm all alone. Gosh! It's 10 to 7pm and I'm still in the office.OT until 9pm. I'm now running a fever. Even if I wanted to go home I cant. Had 3 more walk in students so had to photocopy more manuals.  Oh men...  Called Mike this afternoon. Might go the printers to discuss the invites after getting the ring on Saturday. In the meantime, i printed a draft. Also called Ate. Told her to scout for the technical rider of my band already.  Played badminton the other day for the first time in my entire life. I can say I learned pretty fast. Have a sore arm to show it.Hehehe. I agree it's good exercise. I was sweating like a pig...and pigs dont sweat!! Hahahaha. Myk said we'd play again this Saturday.Am I gonna get addicted like I did when I learned playing billiards??? We'll see.  i gotta update this blog more often...

      Kainis! Layout in the office took longer..about a week. Finally got my internet connection this morning...sayang, just when I was getting the hang of this blogspot.I miss putting an entry..half a month din pala I didnt put anything.  It's 7:20pm, I'm still in the office. I'm still waiting for myk. Supposed to teach him how to do a website for our finals on Friday. para lang may ma-submit. Heheheeh. Aarg!!! May final paper pa pala. I wonder if our groupmates found a topic na? I emailed them this morning...  Guess what? We found THE ring yesterday. Actually, we're having it made pa. We'll be getting it on Saturday, June 19. Myk and I had to attend a wedding last Saturday so we couldn't do our weding stuff. Yesterday, he picked me up and as per other wawies' advices, we went to megamall. 3 and a half hours later, we still havent found the ring we wanted. He finally said, "Let's go to Greenhills" ---- first thing that crossed my mind : TIANGGE!!! But no, that had to wait. The ring first. 3 shops and about 2 hours later, we stumbled upon LORENZO. It's near the entrance in the mall near the cinema. I let Myk do all the talk. Quoted us at 38k. (Gosh!) Gave us a 10k discount (Darn, still way too high). Then we told them that our budget was at 20k and we'd pay right there and then if they gave it to us. We had to call the owner. Guess what, he gave it to us at 20k. Myk and I were sooo happy. Super naka hinga ng maluwag. Such a big accomplishment.

      Happy birthday to us! Happy birthday to us! ----It's our 8th year anniv today!!! Quite long... :p.   Where's Myk? It's almost 5pm.He's not late. He said we'll visit his dad first in the hospital. He's been confined for about 2 weeks now... gallstones and an inflamed pacreas. Was transfered from medical City, Pasig to Makati Med the other day. Doctor says he's okay.   I'm getting hungry... Myk said we'll leave when the food for his parents arrives...finally. Off to Mandarin Oriental for dinner.  Thanks to Myk's sister, we have 2 thousand worth of gift certificate. Hmmm...which restaurant? Ah..The Tivoli. Fine Dining. Myk ordered the Ostrich, I ordered pasta (my favorite)..3 hours later,we're really full and sleepy. Hehehhe.  It's been a busy day. Tired yet happy... 8 years is no joke.

      It's already 1pm...I'm still here in the office!!! Waaaah! 5 more hours...or more maybe, until Myk actually arrives. It's his last seminar day for the Continuing Legal Education thingy.  I'm starting to have a headache. It's so gloomy outside. I wanna go home and sleep. Was checking my email when I saw Nyree's(co - w@wie)post. Clicked the link to her blog..hmm...a begginer also. Lemme try..hehehe. Might as well post something for June 1st since it was our anniv. Hmm..I think i'll get addicted to this. Hehehehe.  Showed Myk the PALakbayan packages last night in class (between reporting). He picked a package (that was fast). Told me to book it already, I said I'd do it today.  Class ended early, thank God.Went back to Pateros, it's his cousin's, Enny's 22nd birthday dinner. Good food! Mark, Myk's other cousin, came back from the US 3 days ago. By 11pm, I'm getting really sleepy. Time to go home.

      Aaarg!!! The sister of my friend caled this morning. His brother was my friend since elementary..and he's also getting married this September. Hay naku, I'm thinking of adding her and her parents in my guestlist..close naman ako sa kanla. Kaya lang, my guestlist is starting to balloon na... oh no!!!  Went to SnR at the Fort to eat lunch. Pizza!!! Saw Reema Changco (just had to text Polgas) with Ryan Eigenmann. Then we went to Megamall to change credit card payment option in Family First. Then finally bought grocery for Joey's baked mussels.  As soon as we got to Joey's, we wet straight to their unit to prepare the mussels. Then we brought it to the office. Alang oven dun so microwave nalang. Hahahaha.  Okay na din. Masarap pa rin...Met Jeng, wife of Brian. Andun din si Ming. Dumating si tei, with her police bf, Joshue and his friend, and Bobby.  Umiral na naman yung 3rd eye ko sa party ni Joey. At 2am, we were in the sala near the balcony. Myk and his friends were talking about their Bicol trip xxx years ago. It was about the white lady they saw that gave them a warning about a truck stopped in front. Then suddenly, this Joey shout towards me. The moment I shouted because of the shock, I saw a woman standing behind him in the balcony. I swear my heartbeat stopped. Myk tried to hug me but I ran to the washroom. I think I stayed for like 20 minutes in the washroom. I couldn't stop crying. Finally let Myk in. he gave me a hug and then I told him. when we went out, I went straight to Myk's office to get my things. He  was the one who told them that I saw someone. That was the same "person" I saw beside Myk in his office months earlier. Haaay.. aside from the fact na I wanted to stranggle Joey for doing that, I really got scared. I think it was the first time Myk saw me like that. Namutla daw ako and he literally saw fear in my eyes daw.
