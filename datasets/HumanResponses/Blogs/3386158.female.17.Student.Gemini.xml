      well so manisha's mum's the one with all the contacts. lets see if that works. and if it dosnt then what the heck? maybe losing a year wont seem that bad as it sounds.... i mean it is but then we'll all be in the same class.gah! its too complicated. but im gonna make sure that we're all gonna be in the same class. but thats if manisha's mum cant help out.  so i went to dhruv(ims) today. lets see how they can help. im kinda prepared to lose a year anyhow. lets see. me, manav, kartik anand, and i forgot the names of the others who flunked. damn i seem to be taking my failure a bit too casually i think. i mean when niddhi got an 82% in the 10th, she was crying like as though she'd just been raped or sumthin... she was crying soooooo badly man. eventually she landed up doin commerce.   well so much for her. heck im the one whose supposed to be crying....!!!

      so i went to nationals today. i attended the Bsc.It orientation. i also found out that they do grant provisional admission too for the people giving the compartment. at least thats what the head of the B.Sc It department told me when i asked her. so maybe then i wont lose a year.  so i reached home and told my mother about it. and she went like "you know it was destined that you would fail" and i was like huh? what the heck are you saying? and what the heck anyway? and she went on about how she spoke to some astrologer when i was a kid and he told her that i would fail. well he didnt exactly mention anything about losing a year so lucky for me. i guess that provisional admission thing is gonna come in handy now.... heck astrologer where are you....? i need some help here!!

      well it would be stupid to start cursing anyone (or even God) when you know yr damned board results. ok so i flunked in math. so i shouldnt curse God. in fact i should be greatful coz i dont hav to repeat a year like some others who flunked in 2 subjects. maybe it was their fate? maybe it was my fate too? but their fate was just a little more twisted. anyway i hope that everything goes well for them. and for everyone else too. i got an 84% in english, 50% in chem, 53% in phy and 55% in bio, and a 25% in math. and thats pretty swell (all exepting the math) coz the way i studied for my boards (last minute).. it was all so..damn fast!!! like i always say, i was born intellegent but education runied me! screwed me rather

      Dear God, if yr there, please hear me out. this is me talking to you  well actually this post is meant only for God to read. so God if your there please hear me out. i just wanna say thankyou for all that you've done for me. i dunno what all you've done coz you've probably done a lot anyway (ie if you really exist... or whoever you really are, whatever you really are) actually i wanted to ask you why you like being "closed" up. it kinda confuses us humans about who or what you really are. but then i suppose you like making things complicating and un-understandable to us. you know i had this friend who claimed he could see the dead and their spirits. he said he could communicate with them and gain a lot of knowledge from them. so one day i asked him about you. he told me that when he asked the spirits about you, they showed him a "rock" in his vision. he said that he never really understood why they showed him that rock. and he dosnt know if that rock was you. you know people pray to you in many forms. i dunno why but sometimes i have this feeling that yr actually human. just like us, but 9000 years ahead. probably just my fictionary imagination again. so then im back to square one. i dont really know who are or what you are or where yr from and what you do.

      Dear God, if yr there, please hear me out. this is me talking to you  well God, i dont know if your really there or not. i dont know if your real or just fiction. i dont know where you exist if you exist. but many people believ in you. i dont know why they believe in you. i dont know why i believe in you when i always have this feeling that you dont exist "here". its kind of complicating to explain by typing. ive never really felt that you were "there". but people tole me that if i believe in you, then you'll believe in me and make my every wish come true. ive never believed in miracles. probably because ive never seen or experienced one. but i dunno why i keep preaching about the same. ok there i go complicating things again. but yr "God", so you'll understand.... right? ive seen so many things since 7th. they've been good and bad. but then again at that time i had only seen thigns. in 11th, you just made me feel those things. and experience was a lot. i learned a lot.  you know God, if your really there, i just wanna say thanks. ive learned a lot. i learned to love, to care, to share... and to do so many more things. most of all ive learned to live and not just merely exist. but then theres still so much more to go thru right? and deep down i knwo that ill live by and thru it. gnite !!

      hell why did God create rain anyway? rain sucks... it makes me bloody well wet and stinky and smelly(yuck) and spoils my hair and spoils my bag and spoils my pants and spoils my shoes(my first love) and most of all SPOILS MY WIND CHEATER! and eventually spoils my mood. being drenched is like probably one of the worst things that can happen to anyone. especially if someone of that "anyone" happens to like be me. yesterday was the third bloody time i got bloody well drenched for no bloody reason. hmph someone really does hate me.... waaaahh! im never getting outta my place till the bloody monsoons end...!! damn it... bah...!

      And i finally saw potter part 3 yesterday (globus). ooooooooooooooooou groovy as it was, the book was still better. again there was no "bastard" sitting behind me. shit man. mals gets all the luck. so thats how it got kinda boring too.  and afterwards we went into globus. and my friend wanted to try on this tee. so he went into the changing room and wore the tee and came back out (leaving his own tee inside the changing room) and was checking himself out in the mirror long enough for someone else to go into the same changing room. the dog who went into the changing room bloody well refused to come out for like a whole half hour man. WTF was that person doing in there? so my friend was stuck wearing the globus tee. and i was mad enough to ask him to try out the swimming trunks as well. shamless rather???. yeah ok im shamless all right. more than all the other girls too. but what the heck? i love being shamless anyhow. lol. yeah so i was fuming coz i wanted to go home and that dog or whatever in the changing room was refusing to get "his" ass outta there. ask me how i know that the person in the changing room was a "he"? well coz after i knocked (and later banged)the door for the idiot inside to get his bloody ass out and got no reply... i shamlessly bent down and looked under the door...!! i looked under to see if there was someone really inside or if the door was just plain stuck!!  and GUESS WHAT I SAW.....!!! there was someone inside. and he was trying on the same trunks i asked my friend to try on. now obviously a girl wont try on trunks right?

WHAT THE HECK?  and to top it all on ym wa home today i see these 2 beggars on the road making out. oh heck whats the world coming too? and it just wasnt a pretty sight. hell so now i do believe the fact that these guys get inspired from movies.

      woah..! talk about growing older when it dosnt seem so. everyone still says that i look like a lil kid. yea maybe thats why i still wanna go paddle boating. i dont care if you dont like it but i do... and many other people do too. so now basically all i gotta do is hope and pray that the club gets electrified back normally and the pool's gonna be clean. the shallow end of the pool ie. i cant afford to drown on my bday. or maybe not on my bday but the day i celebrate my bday... which probably isn't gonna be today anyhow. maybe i should've taken those swimming classs in muscat seriously. and here nikhil thinks im thinking in air. well then ballz to him. hey... theres gonna be a carnival at the club too...! but thats gonna be in sept. talk about my luck..... hmph. anyway... time for me to screw outta my place...!! laterzzzzz!

      dats the movie i saw last night. and funny enough i didnt ask anyone to translate it for me. jeez sometimes i wonder how i watched it anyhow. unlike mals's case there was no "bastard" (read stupid mal's yet again dated on the 5th of june) sitting behing me. damn and i was getting bored. coz at least if there was a "bastard" sitting behind me i could have done some tp. probably asked for his #. but then damn my luck. lol!!! ive lost it again! anyhow and the movie went on with the usual "the almost (not-at-all)desperate guy in his efforts to woo d babes" guess its another pic thats inspired me apart from city of angels(suggested by that ****) and a few songs.... well not a few, a lot. and apparently one of the tum's has an accent now. reported by whizkid. gawd talk about people changing now. been wonderin whats been up with ryan and his "tum"............

      i dont get these guys man. one day they say that they like you. and the next day they say that they love you. and yet again the next day they say that they dont have time to meet you. whose gonna understand them? they just zap us into that stupid trance of theirs and then woo us like this and then woo us like that... probably expecting that we'll fall in love with them more that we aldredy are(if we are... not unless we really are) and one day they'll finally decide that we suck (the BASTARDS). gawd who needs guys anyway? why did god create them anyhow? to confuse the insane ones like me even more than we aldredy are? i think i need prayers and here god's thinkin of screwing me emotionally? what the heck? bahhh...!!! wont suceed this time...!! gakkkkk!!

      i think i should have actually changed my title name. it should be rather something like "BECCY THE BAD BOY SLAPPER" coz i anyway cant slay guys. but i got an amazing record of slapping them. we can start of with mr k.surapaneni who i slapped twice in cirs and i forgot why. and i slapped dat ass oneek and that chut hursh. pretty neat huh? i got crazy guts i suppose. and im only 16 years old! lol! im so proud of me.  i wanna round off my slapping list to 5 by adding bunny to it too. he broke my sharky keychain. and hes so shameless enough to blame the maid for it. hmph. but then i cant slap him man.... hes not a bad guy. hes chooooooo chweet...!! that maid of his only must have broken it. lol! chowwie bunn..

      met bunn today after gap's left. hadto ditch alok and vinay for a while when i went to meet him but they didnt seem to mind anyhow.  so we (bunn and me) spun around for a while and came to mac again. bunn wanted fries so i decided to play waitress for a while. luckily those bloody kids who grab food (and probably even yr boobs if they're different) wern't there to screw my mood up. (parcelled it).   im so proud of the indian beggars. they seem to have learned some manners finally. thank god! god really answered my prayers and changed those ill mannered things overnight

      well then the hsc results caome out today. ashish got a 67% anuj got a 71% bunny got a 68% chirag kinda screwed up totally in 3 subjects(38%) his babe divya got a 62% (i dont exacly remember) his cousin nikhil did pretty well though (forgot his marks) and nikhils babe malvika (ex-icse student) got a 65% and then i banged into neeta when she was going to get her marks. and then i havnt heard from bharti and sagar about thier marks. asif's also totally screwed up. at least he thought he did but i dont know his marks then. arshad told me amrita's marks but i kinda forgot them. and yeah! today is arshad's b'day. its also ankit maroo's b'day and what all did i do today? wake up at 8 and sit down to do math for 2hrs and then got ready and ran outta the house. went straight to bandra. collectd the bmm forms for rajni and then accompanied gurpanna and nikhil and alok to mitibai... then alok and gurpanna ran home and nikhil and me went back to bandra. nikhil went off to pi and i was waitin @ subway to meet chirag when he told me his disastourous news. and then we went to jatc where we met nikhil(his cousin) and malvika and divya. it was my 2nd time meeting both the girls. and then was supposed to meet bunny too but i decided that it would be "healthy" if i didnt. so i told him that i wasnt in bandra and that i was at the andheri mac. oh man talk about lying. thats like the first time ive lied to him. but i think its for the better in a way

      ok so this it what mals writes about me in her blog. i mean how childish can she get (i know yr reading this mals but yr childish anyhow)  Tuesday, June 01, 2004 stupid rebecca...  I was having a conversation with my friend (enemy???) rebecca (msn messenger) and thanks to her, I've started to (temporarily) think and remember stuff....drain bramage!!...brain damage...whatever.....(I usually don't think so much)....she thinks I'm going to do whatever she says ....perhaps she hasn't realised that I'm not her paid slave or anyone's slave for that matter....I'm not going to, in any way do "B.Sc.it." or whatever she wants me to do (to give her company)....I've made a decision to do either: 1) nothing at all 2) become a mass murderer  3) somehow morph into a vampire or werewolf 4) aid lucifer (bless the devil!)  5) destroy the world 6) if none of the above are possible (or if I'm bored) I shall be an artist,author or both. These vocations are chosen on the basis of what I am capable of doing (which is..ummm...very insignificant)...I'd prefer the first and the last one but since I believe in destiny, life shall take its own course. But whatever the case, I am most certainly going to watch the Harry Potter movie... and if possible, Van Helsing too.  P.S.: Rebecca, I still stand by what I had said earlier about  that sms.It really is very "mommy-ish"....   so thats whats mals wrote about me. i put my heart and soul into figuring out what kinda msg i was gonna msg *** about on his birthday.... it took me like 1 whole week to figure out what to send him and stupid mals thinks its "mommy-ish" mals yr an idiot! lol!

      shameless enough and yet i did it once again. bunked my tuts and ran off to watch laws of attraction. and i also learned a few "laws" myself. i ill start yapping of by describin these two "bastards". well so i was on my usual boy-watching spree and there was this one feller, with a blue tee with yellow checks, and this other feller with a blue tee which had black sleeves. and it so happened that the feller(blue tee with yellow checks) happened to kick butt and the other sucked! so while i was busy yapping about the blue hunk to my pals (unfortunatly forgot to specify which blue "hunk", the yummy or the yucky)it so happened that the yucky happned to overhear me yapping about some blue "hunk" and the dog thought i was yapping aout him and well all bloody red in face and oooohhhh forget it. ill rest my case.   BOTTOM LINE: ALL BOYS ARE BASTARDS!!!!

      Don't be aroused by my confession unless you don't give a good goddamn about redemption. I know Christ is coming and so am I. You would too if the sexy devil caught your eye, he'll suck you dry...Soon you'll cry to be back in his bosom to do it again. He'll make you weep and moan and cry to be back in his bosom to do it again...   Pray? Shall I go blind? Pray? Cos nobody ever survives!  Praying to stay in your arms just until I can die a little longer  Saviors and saints, devils and demons alike. He'll eat you alive!   Jesus is risen it's no surprise even he would martyr his momma to ride to hell between those thighs... The pressure is building at the base of my spine. If I gotta sin to see him again then I'm gonna lie and lie and lie. He'll make you cry! I'll sell my soul to be back in your bosom and gladly help. Please suck me dry and still you'll cry to be back in&nbsp;his bosom! Do it again!   My pulse has been rising, my temples are burning, the pressure is so overwhelming and building. So steady and heavy I'm ready to blow. He waits, what is He waiting for?
