       urlLink Narnia  I have the boxed set of the tales of Narnia, having bought it not long after my son was born, telling my wife that it was to read to him when he got older.  That was a lie: I had had an earlier boxed set, a paperback version, and the books had given out, the pages fell out. That was when I was about 19, and after I had read the Chronicles fully through at least four times between the ages of seven and 19. This time I bought a nice boxed set that were hardcovered, and would last longer than 11 years.  I don't remember how many times I have read this particular set, but I think it was previously two times. This is my third time around, and they are still fresh! (I don't think it is the paper of the new set, so perhaps because of memory loss!?) The Christian imagery of the garden of Eden, creation, and the way the inhabitants of Narnia refer to the children as 'The sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve,' is interesting rather than dogmatic.   Aslan the lion is a combination of the fearsome god of the old testament, slaying those who do evil with a vengance, while possessing Jesus' penchant for taking man's sin as his own, as demonstrated in his agreeing to let the White Witch kill him in place of Edmund, who was a traitor.  The stories are stories of good versus evil, light versus darkness, warmth versus cold. And they are stories of forgiveness and sacrafice.  They are timeless, and I always feel like I have benefitted by reading them again. I just finished the Lion the Witch and The Wardrobe coming home on the train this evening.  After an absolutely horrible two days, where I worried about my future in my company, was wounded by the disrespect shown me by one of my co-workers, as well as the temptation offered in a severance package, reading LWW was pure.  Despite it's clarity of good and bad, it also offers a nuanced view of things, where good people could do bad, and repent, and forgiveness is important. Reading these books is helping me get through a stretch that is really challenging me.  I want to be able to read Narnia to my son: It may have been a lie that I bought them for him, but I have always wanted to read them to him. And when I think this, I am confronted with my failure to teach him English.  I am not disappointed in him, but in myself.  I am spending time now every weekend teaching him, but it is probably too little too late for us to enjoy Narnia together, as I did for the first time when my mom read it to us on our front porch in Oakville Washington when I was six.

       urlLink     urlLink The Green Mile  I saw this movie tonight on satellite, years after it came out, and I whatever my own troubles are at work, in my marriage, and the rest of life's curve balls, I forgot them all for a moment, and felt empathy with the characters. Real empathy.  It was, apparently, a mainstream movie, so that fact that it was able to affect me in this way is doubly impressive.   Though Stephen King is regarded as the horr(ible)or king, look at the movies of his that have made the biggest impact: Stand By Me (in which, by the way, high school  urlLink classmates  of mine, Ken and  urlLink John Hodges , appeared as extras in the barfing contest), The Shawshank Redemption, and now this movie, The Green Mile.  Wow! &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink Forbes.com: Vodafone to cut 600 Japan jobs via retirement plan  This story actually came out about 15 minutes before the president sent an e-mail to all of the employees of my  urlLink company.  I knew it was coming.  There have been rumours, and references in the last month or so, and they were hard to completely discount.   Though the story says that it is an 'early retirement' plan, it is hard to imagine 18% of our work force actually choosing to 'retire', so we shall see what happens after we have all had a talk with our superiors, and there are fewer than 600 people who want to lie on a beach (hah!) in their retirement. I guess it depends on how long the company offers people to lie on the beach vis a vis the settlements they offer.  Our workforce is actually, on a per subscriber basis, smaller than any of our sister companies.  Hmm...not good news for me and mine in terms of future security, though I am not that worried about it, since I am doing my job, getting reasonable results, and involved in reasonably important projects.  I should probably finalise the loan arrangements soon for my house...  I am a project manager, and a couple of the projects I have been involved in have begun to wrap up recently.  So, this, along with downsizing, is a bit of a concern.  Even three months ago, in the middle of a project, where a lot of my energy was spent pushing people to do things differently, to change, I would have felt absolutely no insecurity at this point. And, in fact, the president of the company said last month, and in his announcement today that one of the points was to encourage people who have a hard time changing to go on to employment elsewhere. This is all great, but there is that niggling little feeling that I have been like the elephant in the china shop, breaking lots of dishes for the last year, but also getting very good results. So, I have been upsetting people who are pretty well entrenched in the way they do things, which has come back and bit me during my evalution. And right at the point where I am set to buy my home, there is that not insubstantial feeling of insecurity that comes with an abrasive manner and a restructuring. That is not to say I don't think we needed this: We do.  I guess I just worry about payback. Ironically, I worry about payback from precisely the people this restructuring was meant to focus on: The bureaucrats; the guys that put up roadblocks and say 'that is difficult' at every step; the guys that refuse to take responsibility for anything, and then say that they couldn't do anything because they had not been told to; the not insubstantial coterie with a real antipathy for anything from Europe, because it was inferior to whatever we are doing here in Japan; the whole host of people who take no initiative and seem dispirited.  That their positions are in jepordy is probably good, but they have already shown that they are capable of wounding me as well, and that bugs me, and the timing concerns me. C'est la vie. I will just need to get into another project to take my mind away from this.

       urlLink    This is the foundation of our new house as of today: The stairs and other parts have been filled. You will notice that the are cutouts at the top left, and lefthand part, as well, if you look closely, behind the stair on the right. These are to be able to crawl around under the house once it is done, and find termites. The housing company we are buying from has a 20-year guarantee, so they need to be able to do periodic checks.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is the foundation of our new home, as of last Saturday. You will notice the sheets of blue: These are to prevent termites. Also, the stairs are not filled yet. The house you can see to the left is that of our new neighbours, the Satos. We are splitting the cost of a small fence with them. Very nice people. Their house, which you can't see that well in this shot, is actually a three-generation dealy: The older grandma and grandpa are on the first floor, and the child and their kids are on the second and third floors.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink Hauppauge Media MVP  I am building a house. I have asked the builder to install ethernet in all of the rooms, and am planning to have a home server installed in my 'server room' upstairs. This device looks ideal for this purpose! And relatively cheap,to boot. It is only about $99. At first I was thinking of the  urlLink Firefly  remote control product and an RF converter which turned my computer's output to channel three throughout the house. This has the elegance of not requiring much from the TV, like proximity to an Ethernet port. It also means that the quality is pretty low, but perhaps that is acceptable...The main drawback to that option would be that a user would have to deal with a computer interface via a remote control, on a TV.  One guy's  urlLink website  also mentions that the MediaMVP can be customized, since it uses HTML pages to display content. Since my family are roughly bilingual, and because my son doesn't read English yet, this might be good: I could probably whip something up that was very graphically oriented, and something that had simple Japanese for my son. I think that the WinTV product by Hauppauge also is sold in Japan, which means that it should support the channel scheme here, which is slightly different than the U.S.: There is a channel 1 and no channel 13, and the SAP function here seems to use a different signal scheme.  So many choices, and so little time...

       urlLink    They started building on Tuesday this week, and have made pretty good progress for five days of work.  I am impressed! After they finish putting the roof tiles on, which will not be too much longer, the outside will be pretty much done, and what will be left will be the inside. That is about one month's worth of work at the present schedule.&nbsp; urlLink

      Yahoo!, which was previously hosting my family's domain name (frengle.org) e-mail and web page, has decided that they no longer like yen.  Previously, they had a sign-up page which did not ask you for which country you live in. I cancelled my  urlLink Shitty Bank (Japanese pronunciation)  card and needed to change my billing information. They now do ask me to list my country, which I was happy to do, but then don't actually allow anyone outside of the U.S. to sign up. How to put this nicely? Yahoo! sucks!  I don't have anything particular against them, but against all companies whose complete lack of foresight leads them to do stupid things like refusing all non-U.S. credit cards.  urlLink amazon.com  not only allows non-U.S. credit cards, but they have gone out of their way to develop some really viable shipping options for those of us that live outside of the U.S. Yahoo! doesn't even need to do that: They are selling a service.  I had to tell the Yahoo! service rep, who was quite professional in defending the stupid practises of her company, that I hoped they suffered as a result. I am not sure about this new company  urlLink RegisterFly.com : $4.99 a year for domain-hosted e-mail with 5 megabytes of service is not bad. But already they have managed to get on my bad side: They sent me an e-mail telling me how to set the nameserver setting, which I promptly did with the registrar of my domain name.  It turns out that the e-mail was incorrect, so all of my mails for the last three or four days (depending on where you live--it takes a while for DNS addresses to propagate) have been coming back as undeliverable, probably, depending on how many days the mail server tries.  C'est la vie.  I am kind of pissed, but it still beats paying $10 a month for basically the same thing. Below is the conversation I had with the support agent using their online chat system: Client Service Representative: Hello, Welcome to Registerfly LIVE CHAT, This is Client Support Representative Tamarah, How may I Help you? nfrengle: Hello, I signed up for a new mail account four days ago, but the domain is still not in the nameserver, or is not being resolved for some reason.  Client Service Representative: May I have your domain name please ? nfrengle: frengle.org Client Service Representative: Is there anything else I can help you with? Client Service Representative: Let me check the settings for your domain. nfrengle: Please do that. Client Service Representative: Sir, ] Client Service Representative: You will have to set the DNS - ns6.hostingfly.com & ns7.hostingfly.com Client Service Representative: You need to set these settings to use the hosting services nfrengle: What do you mean? In the e-mail I was sent, it said to set the nameserver at the NIC to ns1-ns5. So, what is with ns6 and ns7? Client Service Representative: Sir, these 2 domains will start the services faster nfrengle: Huh? If I go and reset my nameserver setting at the registrar, it takes another 24-48 hours at least to propagate. What is faster about that? Client Service Representative: It will take 24 hours only nfrengle: So why did the e-mail sent to me specify ns1-ns5? nfrengle: (which I correctly set?) Client Service Representative: There must be an error in the welcome email nfrengle: Yep. One more happy customer. (not!) I will open a trouble ticket. Client Service Representative: No that is not needed Client Service Representative: You just have to set the dns - ns6.hostingfly.com & ns7.hostingfly.com nfrengle: There was an error in the e-mail. You said it. That is a problem that needs to be resolved.  Client Service Representative: But everything else in the welcome e mail has the correct info Client Service Representative: Except the DNS info nfrengle: How do I know that? I still haven't gotten anything working yet, and because of this error, at this very moment mails are bouncing.  The Chat session was unexpectedly disconnected.

      I mentioned previously about my  urlLink company  and it's early retirement plan.  I admitted skepticism concerning how many people would take the package. My skepticism was sorely mis-placed: Within two hours of applications being accepted, 18% of our workforce had resigned.  Another 5-10% were probably just a little too late.  Why? One reason is money: They offered a sliding scale based on age and salary: For a 22 year-old, 3 months of salary would be forthcoming. My 36 years qualified me for 12 months of salary. A 52 year-old would have received 30 months worth. Even 12 months is not an insubstantial amount. That, by the way, was in addition to normal severance pay. At my level, I accumulate about 800,000 yen (roughly $7,500) per year in severance pay that can be drawn when my work there ends, for whatever reason. So, someone who was, say, 52, a general manager, and had been with the company awhile, could conceivably be bringing in 35-40 million ($320,000-370,000). If you were that age, the package might truly be an early 'retirement', since that amount of money could actually tide you over until you were really ready to retire.   The people who I know who quit, though, are other gaijin like me, young, and dog-tired of fighting with an entrenched bureaucracy and bureaucratic attitude that makes achieving anything difficult.  In two of the cases, the company is losing a lot by these people quitting.  We had an orientation to this program that all employees were asked to attend. In that, it was stated that the company was offering the program to people who had a hard time working for a global company, who did not want to change their ways and adapt to working in such a company.  The people who I know who took it had just gotten tired of having to work with such people, had been worn down.  Why didn't I? Very good question. My lump-sum amount would have come to about 8 million yen. That is not a small amount. I guess the real reason is twofold: I needed to sign my loan papers for my house while I still had a job. The starting rate becomes available from the morgtage lender on the first day of every month. This program's application date was from June 28 to July 2. I would have been guilty of fraud if I had first put in my request for early retirement and then signed loan documents that listed my employer as my current one.  The other reason is that I don't have anything else, and with a two-week trip to Europe, didn't have much time to line up anything else.  The thing I promised myself was that I would have something else lined up first, or not take the package.  It is an interesting thing to watch this play out, but also makes me sad: People who I care about, who the company needs, have given up on this company, and saying goodbye is sad. And people who really need to have taken the package remain. One team consists entirely of people who 1.) don't like English; 2.) refuse to take responsibility for anything with a global element; 3.) are so stuck in their ways, which are not good, that they proudly speak of never having changed something. That team has managed to make my work difficult and my position precarious. None quit. So, everything is hunky dory...

       urlLink    This is a close-up of my actual new neighborhood. The red square, as you can probably guess, is where my house is being built. I think this picture was taken in May, so there is nothing there yet.

       urlLink    My son's school had a helicopter or airplane or something take some pictures from the sky. They also got the location of our new house and much of the section of the city of Utsunomiya we have chosen to live. It is cool, so I am sharing it. There are many more to share...  Our house is the white square on the bottom rightand side of the picture. My son's school is roughly in the middle, with a red square surrounding it, and in the upper lefthand corner is Utsunomiya station.  The scale of the picture is about 3 kilometres tall by 4 kilometres wide (that is my own very rough estimate).

       urlLink    At a time when I am totally stressed out, I also happened to have just bought my first digital camera, and playing with it has helped me forget about the not insubstantial source of my stress, and do something that feels creative. It helps.&nbsp I used to read the book Goodnight Moon to my son every night before he went to bed. It is interesting, but the reading of it, which I can actually do without looking at the words, having read it so many times, relaxes me, too... In a great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon And a picture of  The cow jumping over the moon And three little bears sitting on chairs And two little kittens and a pair of mittens And a little toy house and a young mouse And a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush And a quiet old lady who was whispering 'hush'... Goodnight room Goodnight moon Goodnight cow jumping over the moon Goodnight light and the red balloon Goodnight bears, goodnight chairs Goodnight kittens And goodnight mittens Goodnight clocks And goodnight socks Goodnight little house And goodnight mouse Goodnight comb  And goodnight brush Goodnight nobody, and goodnight mush And goodnight to the old lady whispering 'hush' Good night stars, goodnight air Goodnight noises everywhere
