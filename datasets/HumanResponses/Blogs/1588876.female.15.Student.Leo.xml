      chris (nye) said that he would be getting gigs this summer playing songs off his album (oh so sway!). he also said that he wants me to come. i can't wait till he's done burning the cd's (he said he's had a little trouble with that) so that he can start playing at gigs. he said that the Delta Cafe is one place he's going to play. he says they have live music now. it used to be pretty small, but i saw that they expanded into the next room on that little strip of shops and a pub, so now it's twice the size. that's good. if i go, that would be so incredibly boday. i haven't seen chris for so long and he says that mel was invited to come too. so if i go and mel goes, then we can all hang out and have one helluva pow wow. man, i haven't seen mel in years, and i haven't seen chris in a year or so. it's all the same though, i love them both. i love all my friends. they're like my family away from family, except with peer drama and more laughs.

      ok, where shall i begin? ew ew ew! ok, my mom reads my email and freaks about everything she reads. everyone gets inappropriate stuff like penis enlargement! i don't even have a penis, mother! you don't have to worry! anyway, recently, i had emailed one of my old teachers that i had this past year...his email addy is on the school website...and he wrote back and my mom read the email. she said it was inappropriate and wrong. "there are sexual predators out there!" she was twisting everyting he said into an innuendo! oh my god! i was so pissed! she watches too much Law and Order SVU. so from now on, im not using that email address anymore. she started comparing me to my oh so perfect sister again...nothing new.  next topic: dirty baby no more? the mom recently asked me for my social security number so she could write off checks and she wouldn't have to pay more taxes. i had a bad feeling when she asked me for that. good thing i don't  know it. so anyway, i told my mom when i got home and se said that was really unnecessary. if she got my ss#, then i would have to start paying taxes! im only 15 and babysitting for 12 bucks a day. i agree with my mom for once. that was really weird. and like i said before, that mother is a total head-case. i mean, can you really trust that someone who uses cloth diapers in this day and age is really sane? this isn't a career for me- it's just a summer thing so i can have the money to buy some fantasmic new clothes for school. so yeah, someone's definitely off their rocker... and it's not anyone on my side of the street.

      i love spinach, fudgsicles, and saltines! not at the same time of course. i ate a whole bag of fresh, uncooked spinach the other day- simply delish. we got a bag of fudgsicles too- yum. and i have already eaten two bags of saltines- simple divinity! i also love my vocabulary. i like to boggle my enemies' minds with words like expound, or even words i make up- mantasmagorical! well, actually, brandon boyd made that up, but i use it almost everyday. i figure if i say it enough and pass it on to friends and they say it enough, then  it might become a word and end up in the dictionary. like the word "jiggy" that became a word after Will Smith's song, 'gettin'jiggy with it', became a total hit. it's in any updated dictionary now. funny how over the years we've added all these slang terms to our everyday vocabulary. "Hooked on Ebonics worked for me!" i made that up a while ago. hahahaha! i made a funny.

      well, im at the cool baby's house. shes really smart...and cute...unlike the bitter-beer face baby who uses cloth freakin' diapers! oh my gosh- the bb face baby's mom says if the diaper is just pee, hang it up to dry! eeecchhhh!!!it's so disgusting! it smells so strong of urine in their house i swear to god im going to pass out one of these days. i never hang it up to dry though. i always throw it into the "diaper" pail. it is so sick how she hates disposable diapers and wipies. oh yes, god forbid you throw away something drenched in human waste!!!the diapers are just underwear so the kid and its clothes are soaked in piss! the mom has to be a total head-case. the kid is possessed too. she doesn't smile or laugh. and it frowns and stares at you from under those ugly little eyebrows. the big brother, nick, is starting to get on my nerves as well. he makes this sick slurping noise as he tickles her. he doesn't get how the kid just doesn't laugh and that he needs to stop being perverted. i think one day, they're going to have oneof those sick redneck romances. their only excuse would be, "me and charlotte love each other! we don't have the same daddy, so it's ok!" (say that in a hick accent). i feel bad for the cats. the dad, keith,charlottes dad, scares the crap outta me. he never smiles either. man, i hate that family. im seriously considering quitting. i need the money though. im not going to babysit as much next month though...i get to babysit the cool baby more! yay! next week, i might call peter and the rest of our little league of losers and bring the kid down to the park- nick wants to go- and show them the golem- from- lord- of- the- rings-look-alike. they wanted a picture but i dont want to spend money on a camera that's just going to break....if you catch my drift.

      catholic icons such as priests, bishops, the pope and who ever else we call "father" or "your majesty" or who ever else we worship are discriminatory bastards. we were taught that the word "catholic" meant "universal". obviously, these people haven't been acting very universal or accepting. they have a problem with homosexuality and married preists, and god knows what else. i don't see the problem with either issue. i think teyare quite egotistical and way too self-loving. they say their god is the true god and idlizing anything or anyone is a sin. i have come to realize this after i myself had experienced strong hatred and discrimination by a preist, an ex-nun, 2 teachers who claim to be women of god, and a millionaire family.  tragic foreshadowing.   i was accused of awful, unthinkable things by the daughter of the millionaire family and the priest. coincidentally, the priest has family ties to the millionaires. he assumed everything was the truth and was telling me this has to stop. my sister and i were unfairly kicked out  of that school. mothers i babysit for have claimed that Holy Family has gotten more political and are planning to take their children out of that institution if it continues to go to hell. that small, 254 (and decreasing) student, catholic school has the most expesive tuition in the state and parents are not getting their moneys' worth.  yes, this is the disturbing truth even though i have left out details...many many details which are circling in my head. to many to put down into typing. i feel deep shame being catholic. by the time i am 18 i will have the freedom to officially convert to unitarian universalism. unitarians have no official beliefs- they are a open-minded, accepting people as am i. i am not bashing people who believe in god, i am bashing the people who are close-minded and discriminatory bastards who claim to be children of god. well someone should call jenny-jones to send these children to boot camp with Raymond Moses.  burn in hell... Father Robert Barricks (Holy Family Church Priest. has criticized MANY families of not being christian) Holy Family Catholic School Principal, Ms. Lockie (i never really cared what the fuck her first name was) Ms. Sandy Jacobs (7th grade teacher) Ms. Anne McCarty (8th grade teacher. lives too close to me for comfort) and finally, Kelsey Giachinno (accuser. liar. bitch. demon seed. sock puppet look-alike) -all of the preceeding may burn in hell for what they have done to many families  kudos and cheers to all of my friends who supported me through the hard times i had to overcome during the lies and cruelty. also, to the victims of kelsey's lies and Fr. Bob's accusations and condemning.

      doug (step-dad) came thursday night and we were put to work early friday morning. that day was the luau- which was a "surprise" party for me. i already knew, biut i didnt tell anyone but the guests who brought gifts and were confused when they saw me. i had to tell them i knew so they weren't freaked out that they may have ruined te "surprise." don't worry- my mom already had that part taken care of. so anyway, we set up and i had to wear a dress. it was a short, low-cut, halter dress. i felt... NAKED. well, i practically was! it's not like me to wear such provocative clothing, but my mom thought it was luau appropriate so i had to wear it. and then doug had on his grass skirt and hawaiian shirt- very nice by the way. i think it takes a very secure man to wear a skirt of any kind. i guess thats why im attracted to that hot luau guy i saw in hawaii. oh my god, i think, im going to melt just thinking about him. i have a picture of him and i somewhere. i should take it to that kodak kiosk thingy and blow up the part with just him. let me just say, i didn't photograph well when i had my short hair. well, i've gotten besides the point. the next day (saturday) was the friggin' bake sale. goddammit! we have so much left over! i gained 5 lbs. ! and now im on my period, which will make me bloated. by the way, i've decided to go anorexic for about a week to quickly lose those unattractive pounds. personally, i don't see anything wrong with it as long as it doesn't become a habit and you exercise regularly. today is the first day, and i expect to report back soon about how it's going.

      it simply infuriates me when people...  give their kids the most retarded names. the poor child will never be taken seriously in life, so stop naming your daughters after strippers and your sons after military positions and cartoon characters. *gives 'the rock eyebrow' to celebrities*  ask you a question they already know the answer to. why are asking? you know already!!!  when jerks steal your jokes or quotes and claims them as their own and basking in the glory you're supposed to have. you didn't make that up! i said that!   when guys talk about "eating pussy" when a girl (me for example) is right there in their presence. may we please change the subject?  who have a reputation for being totally bitchy, then correct you for (supposedly) being mean. you know, you really shouldn't be talking...beotch!!!  underestimate your intelligence extremely and treat you like a special-needs B-kid... mom!!!! im pretty confident that, after 15 years, i would know how to do certain everyday things. yes, i have heard of that little ditty called common sense- i've got some, maybe you woud like a taste. and maybe a little shutup juice for a chaser.  when the "hot" girls stand around in P.E. doing nothing and then crying if the puck "accidentally" hits them in their bitchy little faces. (monotone-)oh. whoops. i guess my stick slipped, causing the puck to hit you square in the forehead leaving the biggest, hardest-to-cover-up-with-makeup bruise the world will ever see. yeah that's right i did it on purpose. im not sorry either!  when the girls who wear way too much make-up claim they're models when they obviously get their pictures done at se ears.  and when they think they're in the entertainment business when they've only been in one commercial for gen-x. that store is just a hyped-up, cheap-ass goodwill. haven't you seen familiar clothes like that on the the jenny-jones-show guests who are teens gone wild? it's all just whore clothes and cheap knockoffs of already cheap pay-less/wal-mart brands.  when people try to force they're beliefs on you even if theyre pointless, immoral, illegal, or fattening.

      i was looking at these pics on the classic hottie- brandon boyd. he is looking delicious! i hate estee lauder face model, carolyn murphy. i think she is using brandon. i just hope she doesnt make him any wafey-er than he already is. i think she has a thing for surfers. she used to be married to one, and now it's brandon. i bet she will be the next Yoko Ono. things were fine until she came along. dirk left, brandon looks wafey, and... she's just ugly. i have to get their album! it's due out in february of 2004- it's seems so far away! i am counting the days! when it comes out, promise me y'all will buy it! if you don't, i won't be your friend anymore! (nice motive, eh?)  besides my beloved "boarding house- north shore". i have to watch that "smash" show tonight...oh, pardon me, it's "PEPSI PRESENTS- Smash" it looks kinda cool. i think it's like a concert of all these bands and artists. im just watching it for the rock acts- a horse is a horse, of course of course. the ataris, foo fighters, evanescence, and a few other rock bands will be playing. and you know foo-fighters are gonna kick some serious kung-foo-grip ass!   later fellow kelsey hater!

      i thought i only had to babysit dina and liam (who, by the way, are really good kids), but as it turned out, i had to babysit their two cousins as well. i could tell they were going to be a challenge from the get-go beacause out of nowhere, they would come up to you and scream in your face. so here's how it went south- we were playing outside with the chalk when the neighbors dog (a sweetheart of course) barely brushes up against Carrie (that girl is so aptly named. if you've seen the horror film, you would know what I'm talking about) and she barely brushes the sidewalk. she immediatly starts screaming her lungs out, so i try to take her inside to get it cleaned up. she pushes me away, so i pick her up kicking and screaming and took her into the house. the minute i put her down, she ran upstairs and slammed the door to the room she was sharing with dina. i got a warm cloth with a bit of soap so her (oh so light) scrapes could get cleaned. i tried to open the door, but she was curled up, screaming "gooooo aaaaaaaway!!!!!!" i pushed the door open slowly so as to not hurt her (but you know i wanted to). i just barely squeezed in and she was kicking and screaming. i kept saying, "no! im not going to go away. it's going to hurt more if you don't stop crying. we need to get it clean!"  so anyway, i had to pin her down (gently of course) and i managed to just dab the owies (yes, owies). then i tried to get a band-aid on at least one but she plumb wouldn't have it! she kicked me, almost in my face, but i blocked it with my arm and she gave me a bruise (which is fortunately gone now). at that point, i just couldn't take it anymore. and then jack, the other cousin, and liam come running in saying they tripped and hurt themselves. i didn't see a thing, but they were crying too. we got them some ice to calm them down and put them in front of the TV- that worked like magic. meanwhile, carrie was still screaming. Dina got her the phone so se could talk to her mom. she had the phone even after it was hung up, so the off-hook tone was sounding. i grabbed the phone from her to give to dina (at this point, carrie was under the bed).  the parents had to come home early because i just couldn't take it and i was trying real hard not to cry anymore. the parents weren't upset at all at me. in fact, they were so understanding. they think carrie has ADHD. according to them, she does this all the time. i went home and got yelled at by my mom (yet again. nothing new) about not being tough enough. for awhile, i felt as if i had pulled a "Ms. Rose" (Kellogg clasmates know what I'm talking about), until i got yelled at. it just pisses me off how insensitive that bitch can be. she wasn't there. she doesn't know! it was the same old routine- scold, compare me to caroline, send me to bed (at 8:30- whatever!), then bad mouth me to doug and make me look like a mentally retarded B-kid. i can't wait until i move out!!!!!!!!!! my cousin and i have made apct to go on a road trip after we get our own places.   we are the shiznit.

      every night now, i vow to do 100 to 200 crunches every night, and jog every other night if not every night. i will eat healthier and show some freakin' self-control.  i could sure go for some baguette with butter...or margarine. hey, is "i can't believe it's not butter" margarine? i could never tell the diff between butter, margarine, or substitutes. they have subs made of just veggie oils. i can't believe it's not butter or margarine!

      last christmas (2002) i got a penguin from build-a-bear. my sister got it for me. he's the shiznit. he came with a white shirt and a red one. recently, i bought these really boday shirts. one is an orange tie-dye smiley face one and the other is just a simple ray one. i layered the orange on top of the gray and it looks totally sway. pengoo (that's his name) wears my studded cuff on his right ankle and this hemp beaded bracelet i made for myself a long time ago, but it's kind of about to fall apart at the hooks, on his neck as a necklace. i wore it as a bracelet all doubled up because it was too big for my wrist. i must say, i make a pretty kick-ass hemp accessory. i make a pretty kung-foo smoothie/milkshake too.  *thanks to chris for the words "sway" and "boday"*  im holding him right now (the penguin, you silly goose!)  speaking of words, my friends and i use the word obese in place of "an outrage" or "sucky". we say, "that is so obese! omigod!". and i say kung-foo in place of kick-ass...i say kick-ass too. peter, chaz and i always say "yee-yee." as our way to say "hey" or "right on". so there you go, just another little tid-bit of my extensive, retarded vocabulary.

      I've been dorkin' it up at enjoyincubus.com sending questions to the guys and being an incu-nerd. i want a drum kit real bad. i saw a killer set on The Price is Right. this dude passed up this kick-ass showcase for this one with furniture. You could tell when he won that one instead. I bet he was wishin' he hadn't passed up his first option with the Peace drum kit and Volcom surfboards and a trip. goddamnit! i was pissed at him. that was one of the best showcases they've ever had! He was with this stupid christian group. They "go around lovin' on people". so yeah, i have no idea how he thought he would've gotten a better showcase than a trip, drumkit, and surfboards. oh well.

      sup suppy? well, im at the cool baby's house and we're having so much fun- as always! we went down to the park and played on the swings and the jungle gym and such. it's really irritating how these little cliques of suburban moms talk and gossip as if they were in high school again and give me these disapproving looks just because im a teenager with a child. she's not my child, and i feel paranoid that people think that! ok...about the dirty baby- i have to still babysit her and the mom was trying to make me take care of their cats while they were away. she is a crazy, medicated woman. she reminds me vividly of senorita adams- fatty be damned. my mom is still ranting about how these ppl are really odd. you know what it took to get her attention so my mom could talk to her about the social security number thing? ok, my mom called the number on the checks she wrote and there was no answer. we put post-its on their door and there was no response when they saw them. my mom went over there and asked keith if she could talk to psycho (not exactly her words), and all she got was keith sticking his head in the door and asking she was busy and she said yes, so that didint work either. then to finally get her attention, my mom kept me home until psycho sent her son over (i dont think she ever enters the land of the living) to ask if i was coming over. i told him why i was home and gave him my moms work # to give to that woman he calls "mom". so they had a long talk and i had to go over there after all and be miserable. can you believe it took all that  over the course of 6 days to get those wackos' attention?! and can you believe that when i finally went over there around 10:00, they hadn't even fed or changed that kid?!?!?!?! she wakes up at 7:30!!!! that kid went for 2 1/2 hours marinading in her shit!!!!!!! i hate that woman and the dad- he's just plain creepy. you know, i think it it hilarious how psycho woman has a sister who looks like an actress and then you look at her and scream, "no no! take it away! take it away!". there's this picture of the two side by side- it's like something out of a movie. you see the pretty one, then you look a little to the right and see the ugly one! it is freakin' brilliant!

      christopher walken is my favorite actor/writer. and for a good reason too. he plays such colorful characters- he plays them well b/c he's basically just being himself. i find him interesting, intelligent, lively, and humorous. he has regular columns in Rolling Stone and Variety. recently (i think), he wrote a column in The Onion about his all-consuming passion for hot dogs. i loved it so much, i printed it and i plan to put it in the clear plastic cover of my binder when we go back to school next wednesday.  -the three things i love most besides money (not in any particular order):  *christopher walken *jell-o *the muppets

The mark line is actually really cool. i wanted to order some stuff for myself, but i have to say no- it's for the customers...or should i say, "clientelle". i get this make-over kit to take to mark parties and other mark events. i never thought i would get into this, but this actually pretty awesome! im so excited! they gave me this cool tote to carry around mark stuff, and i get prizes for points. Mark is open to girls in highschool and college, but im sure older ladies can do it too. it's so fun! for more info, go to www.meetmark.com

      being a soon-to-be freshman, we had to go to registration and get all these things done- lockers assigned, schedules (in many cases including mine, schedule corrections), student ID's, school pictures, books assigned, mandatory fees, and optional fees. my feet are so goddamn tired. its so easy to get lost at that school! jiminy christmas! but hey, at least we got all that shit done and out of the way.  after we were done, we went straight to the dentist's office to get my tooth fixed. my front, top right tooth had a chip on the corner, so they filed it down and filled it in. why do dentists ask you questions when it's obvious you can't move your mouth? they should at least give you a pen and a pad of paper to write on so they don't have to guess what two grunts and a drool means. but Dr. Otteson is a pretty cool guy. he had an assistant with him. she was really pretty and the type who could easily be your "cool aunt".  why do some girls automatically think it's ok to come up and hug you instead of a simple "hey" ? i hate that! today, i saw a girl i talked to once or twice before (i dont even know her name. how she knows mine, i have no idea) and i went up to ask her where we check our books in. she comes up and, yes, hugs me- or at least makes an attempt to. i put my arms in front of me (obvious body language that says, "keep your distance- i dont even know your name." and she showed us where she thought it would be. we passed it and i was all "there it is fools!" well, minus the "fools" part. we were guided through the 'getting the appropriate books' process. then we had to wait in line carrying 5 text books that really showed off my muscle tone. im just glad mom and caroline got to sit down, otherwise, mom might have thrown up and caroline would have pouted and done that heavy breathing drama thing that pisses me off.   there were some unnecessarily loud and obnoxious people there. you know, the kind of people who see one another and squeal and run around like escaped mental patients trying to act all cool b/c they're in a high-school building and just the air and the environment makes them go completely insane and causes them to go into involuntary giggle-attacks while over-using the word "retard" and "omigod!". you know, that kind.  if i had to sum up my day in 3 words i would have to say without a shadow of doubt: long, hectic, and tedious.

      oh. my. goodness.  i am such a damn good driver! it was like a really fun amusement park ride. my mom was actually calm through the whole thing- which was a shock to us all. today, as my first lesson, i learned how to turn, brake, park,  and put it into the different gears. i think im pretty good at all of those except parking. i need to work on getting parked straight...i tend to leave too much room on the driver's side.  i was going pretty slow. eventually, i started giving it some gas. mom was actually encouraging me to give some speed. we were trying it out in the parking lot of her office building, then my mom drove down the block to another parking lot of another building. she was just curious to see what is was like over there. i mean, what better tour guide than your own daughter learning how to drive while making rounds and exploring the concrete jungle of a parking lot, right? it was really fun. i was pretty calm as well- also a shock to those whom i have expressed my fear to. anyway, i turn 15 officially on the 21st of august, so i have about 2 weeks left or so until i get my permit. my mom was so cool about the whole thing. i was asking her if i could go here, if i could go there, and she just kept saying, "you're the driver. just don't exit the parking lot."  damn. that was an experience. i get to go again next weekend. im such a speed demon- 5 miles per hour...wow.

      well, today we ended up going to fred meyer's to get some stuff and put off the driving until tomorrow. it's weird..my mom is happy for me (i think we've witnessed a miracle today, folks) and im so scared, i could shit my pants right here, right now.  according to doug, "it's easier than you think, and harder than it looks." well, i guess we'll just have to see how it goes...  since we went to freddy's today, we got some cement to put up this arbor in the backyard and it was actually kind of cool...bonding with my mom for once. i think with the whole driving thing, she's gotten kind of cooler and started treating me like a 15 yr. old for once.  so anyway...thats the story for now.   later gators.

      today, i ate 3 boxes of jell-o.  they were the small ones that are like not even a dollar each. for breakfast, i had lemon. for lunch, i had grape. and when dinner came rollin' around, i had apricot. it was a good day for jell-o. dude! it was sooooo good! jell-o is my favorite food!  you know, i could probably live on jell-o.

      tomorrow, im going to work with mom (along with some money, my scrapbook, and a book to read), and since it's a saturday, the parking lot will be pretty desolate. not that it usually matters what the parking lot looks like, but tomorrow, it matters. my mom is going to let me try to drive a bit!i am so excited! and nervous. with her in the car, it adds so much more pressure.  y'all can be sure i'll be going slower than a senior citizen on sleeping pills. im pretty excited, but at the same time, nervous about my performance in front of my mom and in general.  ooh ooh ooh! i forgot to mention these dudes that always go to the parking lot on the weekends to skate. i tell my mom that im gonna go for a walk around the building, but i neglect to mention that i'll actually be sneaking around bushes and spying on them when im not walking nonchalantly by the skaters with the hot bodies, hair, and the way they look at me...whoo whee! ever since i lost weight, i've gotten more looks from guys. i haven't dressed differently, and luckily for me it's only guys in my age range. when i see a potential 40-something perv, i keep walking looking like an angsty teen looking at the ground while i walk. anyway, im really anxious for tomorrow. don't cross your fingers for me- it's bad luck.

      im getting kinda skinny...and i havent been eating three times a day- once a day has been working for me, then drink liquids (duh- what else) to fill me up. i actually think its for the best. i finally have reached a healthy weight almost... i need to lose 5 more pounds to actually be at the average weight. but i do have alot of muscle and mmuscle is heavier than fat. so yeah..i guess 130 is okay. the other day, my sister was like, "eww! i ccan see your ribs and your pelvis bones!" i was lying down so of course you could see some bones. i am far from a walking skeleton similar to the one i saw on the video screen at the incubus concert during one of the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. songs (im pretty sure it was 'a certain shade of green'). my mom thinks im anorexic--i would concur madam! im just going vegetarian and eating once a day. its not like i dont eat at all. i would say im looking pretty okay i guess.

      i think it's next week that we go to the beach. we have to bring caroline's little friend molly. i guess that'll be something to keep caroline out of my hair, and they can actually be somewhat funny when they're together. silly 4th graders.  im still debating which beach i would like to visit. Cannon Beach or Seaside? Cannon is where all my fellow incubus friends are and where the kitchy little boutiques are. Seaside is more touristy- outlet shops (gap, nike, etc.), and other fun stuff. im leaning more towards Cannon- i could probably get some cool stuff at LuLu's. but, on the other hand, i need some pants for school...and i can get them inexpensive at the outlet stores...hmmm...  *ponder ponder ponder*

      this morning when when mom turned down the street to get to the cool-baby's house, this woman was walking in the middle of the road (she looked kinda balck-magic, witch-like) and when my mom turned into Shaver St., the woman made claws with her hands (like when you play like a cat and and make your fingers look like claws) and went, "RRAAWWRR!!!" Now, i have no idea why, but i think she did it because she thought my mom was aiming to run her down. hmm, imagine that- getting hit while walking in the middle of the street...it's unheard of, i tell you! simply out of the ordinary (that was sarcasm).  People like that aren't uncommon here in Portand. the Portland community are a very eclectic people. sometimes i think we're a Seattle Jr.  If Portland was a little more festive and flamboyantly gay, we would be San Francisco.  When they aren't drunk, the delirious hobos are uproarious- simply hilarious!

      i got a kick-ass new shirt this weekend. it's one of those vintage looking shirts with the Junior Mints logo/candy box picture on it. it's green and it looks cool (for lack of a better description). im gonna wear it this thursday when i go to the cool baby's house to babysit. she absolutely loves them. one time when her mom came home early, she brought home a box of, none other than, Junior mints. now, livvy's first reaction was not, "mommy!", but rather, "Juna Mintz!" she was so excited! it was hilarious! she hopped and quickly skedaddled to the choco-covered mint cream candy. she didnt even bother to hug her mom or even show an inkling of surprise that her mom was home early for her lunch-break. all she cared about was the mint chocolate buttons of joy.   understandably so...she's two (almost three). give her a break.  im watching the series premiere of The OC, and let me just say- shit is good. i like it already.  later bitches...im gonna watch the rest.

      ok, so it starts at my "surprise" party after people are starting to go home and i changed back into normal clothes. i was walking Suda and Henry and this dude, who's probably like 13, says "nice dogs."  and tosses me this smile that's supposed to be hot but is actually creepy as hell. and then last night i saw him when i was helping mom in the yard and he smiles...again! and finally, i saw him tonight when i was walking henry and he was on his bike and his body moves forward but his neck and ugly face stays on me...smiling again!!! this time he had some ugly-ass blue contacts in. you know, the kind asians wear so they think they look cool. im not assian bashing now, im 1/4 vietnamese (although you would never suspect) and have all viet cousins. now, i know you're saying to yourself, "don't be such a cold-hearted, snobby bitch, addie! he thinks you're pretty."  but my reply to that is this: the smile is cocky and creepy with a stalker-esque style to it. with the haed tilted slightly downward so it gives a little Hannibal Lecter spice to it.  so there you go.

      i miss my friends. i never get called. why is that? maybe it was that violent outburst i had at lunch that one day... who knew throwing chairs and knocking people unconscious turned people off. hmm... boggles the mind, i tell ya. boggles the mind.  *note: none of the preceeding was true...except the part about me missing my friends. blap!

      this CD came in the mail with the BMG music stuff. this dude, damien rice...pretty good. it's a recording of him live at the union chapel. i listen to it when i sleep. it's mellow. it's delicious. this song sung by felllow vocalist, lisa hannigan, is called "be my husband". it has some tight tribal drums and vocals. she's really good. i was thinking of playing at my wedding someday. lol. the whole Cd is pretty tight (i wouldn't consider it an album b/c it's not the album, it's a recording of him live...a sampler with full length songs.)

      checking in-----  i have made a shitload of new friends. some other people are on my list to try and talk to...problem is...im actually really shy. well how have i made a shitload of friends you ask? i don't know. i guess i bond with folks over a joke, or more commonly, bands.   this dude, ahmed, is really starting to get on my nerves. yeah he can be ok, but that's enough guy. just stop. you're not funny. and stop staring at me for god sake. jesus.  i love cleveland a lot. it really suits me. my mom called liberal the other day b/c she says i dress like one. in the wise words of mel, "um...yeah...thanks."  there's this guy, danny, who is in my biology and comp. lit. class who is in a band called chloroform. i havent heard them, but i will soon. danny says he's gonna bring me the album on monday (in exchange for 4 bucks of course. pretty good). My friend, who's ID i will keep secret for fear of my life, told me about this other dude, ross, who's in her comp lit class and today i found out that he was vocals/guitar for chloroform. i've spoken to a different Ross (Ross Herring- never met him personally) once online, but that was short lived. then i was formally introduced to this Ross (Ross McLeron) at the library during my comp lit period. tall guy.  i spoke with adam today and pretty much caught up on the current events in our life. talked about chris and such.  speaking of chris, i spoke with him on the phone twice (when i told adam this his eyebrow went up and gave me an, "oooh" b/c i had this stupid little infatuation with him in 7th grade), and we're planning on seeing school of rock together with mel.   and speaking of mel, mum is finally speaking with the family again and now we dont have to intricately plan when and where we're going to meet up to avoid conffrontation b/t the sisters (my mom and hers). oh frabjous day!  by the end of each week, i am so tired. i am as spent as a billion dollars in michael jackson's pocket.  you know, i am so flattered...yet have an awkward feeling. i have had 3 guys already tell me im cute. im flattered b/c they think im pretty, and i feel awkward b/c i never used to appeal to any guys before and i guess im not used to it. all my friends are so pretty and i always felt like i was always in their shadow while they were exchanging  screen names with some hot guy. i guess im "blossoming". but not in the sense of you know, boobs. got those a long time ago. im blossoming in the sense of attractiveness. not just physical, but personality-wise. im more happy i guess. i feel a lot happier in high school.

      i ate lunch alone today. i couldn't find anyone i knew at lunch today, so i planted my sad self on the stairs outside and ate my apple and 3 cookies all by my lonesome. i felt kinda sad, b/c it's harder to find friends in high-school where you don't know anyone and you have a hard enough time swimming through the crowds of people just to get to a classroom that's two doors away. i have made some new friends, but i still feel like a little girl lost. it's only the second day- why am i rushing things? i guess it's b/c it's been feeling like an eternity. everyone has either come from sellwood, hosford, EMS, or DiVinci. everyone knows eachother and laughs together in the halls and has someone to sit with at lunch. i hated lunch today. im usually surrounded by friends, but this is high-school now- get over your contagious laugh, sparkiling smile, and constant group of friends. this is new...quite an experience may i say. oddly enough, im kinda happy at cleveland. sure, freshman year is rough, but hey, that's just the way it goes.  p.s. im in love with a Quinn  Allman look-alike! he looks just like him. absolute craziness. insane hotness. this heat is making me crazy. im more of a jacket-weather person myself.

      i am not ready to go out with anyone yet.  you will know when im ready- believe me. i have a hard time being subtle about my moods.  4 guys already. please stop. god damn.  im not even that cool. im weird and i act like a boy. i hope im discouraging certain ppl (you know who you are) from hitting on me at the moment.   yes, im flattered...extremely. but i get embarrassed about this easily and i just dont want to have to freeze up, turn red, have my heart beat fast, literally go speechless, and feel put on the spot for a 5th time.  thanks. addie

      god..mom is such a puss when it come to shopping with me. we went to 23rd, and then to hawthorne, b/c caroline had a friend over and i suggested shopping. it was taken as a good idea- despite the rain.  all day the mum complains about how liberal i've become and how i have to stop shopping with the "bleeding hearts".  listening to political talk radio with Michael Savage a bit much are we?  on the bright side, i got to go to urban outfitter and get some kick-ass gear. i got a scarf, a hat, knee-socks (yay!), and a shirt (and a very pretty one might i add). next time we go back, im going to get Chris his b-day present. i was originally going to get him a guitar pick, but then i saw this t-shirt at urban outfitters today and i thought.."oh my god... how perfect is this for chris?!"  now, i havent gotten it yet, but next time i go...i have to remember to bring at least $30. now i know you're probably wondering, "what, pray tell, does this shirt look like addie?" well, i cant tell b/c i have given chris my blog address, and i fear i will give the whole damn thing away if i reveal the details of this tell-tale shirt if he reads this.  *if you're reading this, chris--- sorry. you're gonna have to wait. be happy you know its a shirt. you wear a medium in men's right? i'll just get one that looks like it fits you. i hope you dont have the same shirt already ::crosses fingers:: but if you do, then you can always use mine as a back-up. back-ups always rock.

      this dude who gets on my bus  every  morning is certainly a shady and suspicious man. i thinkhe's on speed or something...he has twitches and it looks like his jaw is about to fly right off his face. every fucking day he gets on the same bus im on. i try to take an earlier or later bus, but still low and behold- there he is. it's like he checks if im on the bus- no matter how packed it is or how crammed into the back i am, he always manages to find a spot or some kind and caring bastard lets him have their seat...right next to me. so of course, i get up and stand.  you know that feeling of eyes watching you? how you can feel someone staring you down? i feel that every morning...i look to the corner of my eyes and he smiling this perverted smile. i look away and try to hide my disgust- but by my facial expression, you can tell i am not sucessful at hiding my feelings. even on thursdays when we start like 2 hours later, he gets on that bus- that goddamn 9.  maybe he has the same schedule but i seriously doubt it. yes, some of you may think its hilarious...until it happens to you!!!  im just glad its in the morning..not after school- who wants a perv following you home? not me.

      there's this coffee-house thing that really really really wanted to attend at jesuit, but dammit- i can't go! i was going to go see chris and his band (thereafter- mentioned earlier) and chill out with mel and chris and make some new friends- b/c god knows i can never have enough!  anyway....  i can go see chloroform though- deal is...its not certain that they're playing for sure yet. if they do play, it'll be at The Solid State. never been there, but anticipate it to be an ass load of fun.  im not going to the meow meow with sadie- i had to choose b/t the meow meow or hanging out with mel and the rest of PLT. obviously, i chose the latter.  i wish i had the talent to write songs and sing. but no, i can only drum.   "it's ok, baby- we'll always have drums"

      ok..i haven't checked in a long long while, so here goes---  i got chloroform's album...well, sampler album really. this sample really takes me back to costco *cue wavy screen and chimey music* you know when you try a smaple at costco and then you go back for more, and then finally, the lady goes, "this ain't no buffet liltte girl!" and then makes you leave? well thats how this is. it is so amazing. im such a freak...im in a 'im gonna make t-shirts!' mode right now. but yeah...why don't we just keep it at "it's pretty damn good."  another band i am currently raving about is thereafter. chris is lead vocals and rhythm acoustic guitar. his vocals have definitely matured. they sound so smooth and creamy. quite nice. i went on their site to listen to tid-bits of their songs 'elevator', 'blue doors', and 'feelings teach'.  let us also keep this at "it's pretty damn good."  it's obvious that i am without words for these two incredible bands. if y'all want to check them out here are the sites: thereafter- www.thereafter.moonfruit.com chloroform- www.chloroformusic.com  cheers!

      alrighty...i havent written in here forever so here's an update on my social, academic, and sex/love life-->  im grounded until the end of this year b/c i got 2 C's on my report card. that means no school functions like games or dances, and no going online (im babysitting right now, so mom dont know).  socially, i feel fine. im still making tons of new friends and life is going smoothly.  ok...time for the much anticipated sex/love life update. last week i briefly went out with someone.8th guy this year to ask me out. it lasted for literally 1 day. it only lasted that long b/c i was gone all day that day on a field trip. why did i even go out with him at all? wel, i'll tell you. it was all a big mistake. i said yes on accident. i dont know why i said yes when in my mind i was screaming no. i feel like garbage already, but im moving on...unlike kelly (the dude). he says im such a tease and that i "teased his heart." whatever. you sure know how to make everyone laugh [at you], kelly.  i hope i dont get  a reputation for being a one-day wonder. after all...this was the first guy i've gone out with, so the name really cant stick. its fun to make fun of myself for that though.  and then there's this dude....im not sure if i want to say his name for the world to know, so let's just call him "jay". i like him alot and we hang out at school. we had 2 half days this week and tuesday we went to sellwood and hung out there for awhile with his little brother. i think everyone thought we were going out. girls would say, "whos this?" and he would say, "this is my girlfriend! haha just joking." made me kind of wish we were, but im sort of embarrassed to tell anyone who i like. speaking of telling ppl who i like.... wednesday, after school before i went to go see Elf with a couple friends, my awesome friend ian motions me to come talk to him. he asks me, "do you like jay?" and i said, "yeah...does he like me?" and then ian goes "mmhmm" and im all, "did he ask you to ask me?" and he said, "mmhmm." i was really excited and of course, being me, i wasnt successful at hiding my emotions.  i hope "jay" asks me out...if he does, i might stop calling him "jay"  im such a dork.  "fo sho!"

      mood:pissed and anticipation music:"hit that"- offspring  ok, so its day 3 of snow, ice and no school and i have already officially gone insane.  examples: 1) today i was bored and i decide to just go outside and shovel the driveway. sane? i think not. 2) afterwards, i go inside and finish altering a t-shirt for my dog. yes folks... i sewed a shirt for my dog. hey, would you want your dog to be naked in weather like this? 3) i watch a little Jerry Springer and find myself saying, "oh, i've already seen this one before." 4) my health is failing. last night, i had to get rushed to the hospital b/c i woke up in the middle of the nght and my heart is violently pounding against the inside of my chest and i cant breathe. i seriously thought i was haveing a heart-attack.  my mom gets me into the ambulance ive got that awesome mask and everything and all of a sudden, i start cracking up. yeah- thats just classic addie right there. laughing at the most inappropriate moment. the guys in the ambualnce start laughing and im going, "o my god! i cant help it! why am i laughing! hahahahaha! *gasp* gasp*"  so anyhoo, once we get to the hospital, the doctor comes in and goes through a whole routine of questions and poking and finally says, "maybe you should just lay off caffeine. you kids at this age need to just get enough sleep and eat well." "ok. hahaha." "why are you laughing?" "i have no idea. hahaha"  needless to say, mom was pissed and i got lectured on how i need to "save the giggling for later, addie!"  meanwhile, i have to keep pounding my chest to make it feel better and its NOT funny when i look like a wigger doing it.     hahahahahaha. just kidding. i laugh everytime i do it.

      yesterday was our first day back to school and today im back at home b/c school was closed due to the fucking snow!!!!! of course, days like this call for yet another one of my moms culinary rampages. shes made soup and feeels obligated to feed the whole neaighborhood. "its a good thing to do for your neighbors" she says. how do the neighbors receive the "good thing" you ask? well let me just tell you...mom doesnt do it. caroline doesnt do it, henry doesnt do it. the neighbor5s dont come over themselves and get it. i have to trek in the snow/hail/ 5 mph, -3* wind all over the neighborhood. let me just say that i am not shocked to see the confused look on ppl's faces when they see the abominable snowkid show up at their door. more than half the neighborhood has no clue who we are. i dont even explain who we are b/c fortunately ppl act gracious enough to just go with the flow. do i care whether or not ppl eat this stupid soup given to them by complete strangers? no. my face feels so raw right now. my corneas feel so scratched, im surprised im not blind. thanks to the russians, my blood pressure is so high right now. im trying to walk through and they just stand there kicking up snow like they dont even see me coming through and yelling, "get out of the way and go home like normal ppl!!!!"  no. they just stand there kicking the dry snow up into the wind and into my face and eyes.  my heart is hurting so badly right now. im shaking like crazy and my heart is beating so fast i have to keep beating my chest and taking deep breaths to ease the pain. i hope my heart is ok. damn.   the only thing i will admit to liking about this snow day is no geometry test. we were supposed to have one today, but obviously its going to be postponed unitl we get back....if we get back at all if this insanity ceases. im the only person who hates staying home....only b/c my home is a crazy house and i highly doubt anyone else's parents makes them go out into the snow with a possible heart problem.  pardon me if i sound coldhearted (no pun intended), but im just pissed at the world right now. i want to be with friends...not home going around the neighborhood feeding strangers and getting an icy exfoliating facial. not exactly the ideal spa treatment.

      mood:self-pity music:"holy ghost"- La Guardia  wow. i am really stupid.  alright, so being my stupid self, i tend to do the most retarded things when i goof-off with friends. Today, my stupid-tendencies caught up with me.  it started yesterday when i was walking to my bus stop with Ruby after school. she said, "hey, bobby got your little message." "uh..what?!" "yeah. he wrote back 'haha addy. i know its you. i know the addinator.' "  i asked her how he found out it was me.  "he tricked me. he just asked who calls him the bobbinator and i said Addie."  i guess she didnt know he was reading his desk. it turns out he saw what i wrote on his desk on tuesday. i had written "i (heart) the bobbinator" Madeline and i were just writing random things on desks like "i (heart) money" and "i own you". i thought it would be funny if i wrote "i (heart) the bobbinator on his desk. i changed my writing and everything. i knew he had Shapiro 3rd period- right before me b/c i have it 4th. so anyhoo, i was talking to rubes and i was like, "oh crap!!!" and i was freaking out. but hten i thought to myself, "wait, he knows my name, but can he place aface? no way- ruby would never point me out." so sarah, madeline, ceilidh, and i decided that around bobby, will, and wills friends, and at school, i would take on the alias: "Gretchen" ruby suggested that if a last name is in question, i take on the alias "Gretchen Ross" Yes. like the girl in Donny Darko. well it turned out i was right-   ruby   wouldnt point me out.  so then it was today. i went into geometry and went to his desk and saw where he had written back. i wrote back "dammit, i tried to change my writing and everything." and only a few minutes later when class was just about to start, sarah- who sits in front of me- says, "um...theres someone at the door for you....?" and she points to the door. i look over and to my utter surprise, i see wesley merritt (ceilidh's bro's friend), a few other guys, and- oh yes...a real shocker- bobby. they were yelling and laughing and pointing and screaming. i see wesely above the rest pointing me out to everyone going "thats her!! right there!! thats her!! thats her!!!!" my face got all red and i felt like i was about to explode. i was laughing out of my sheer embarrassment but was saying, "holy shit! oh my god! oh my god!"  how did he know who i was? he only saw me once when he and i spent the night and the nichols' place (he with will, and i with ceilidh and sarah). we dont know eachother! how did he know who i was? maybe this was payback for the harrassment that took place when he fell asleep on the recliner that night. that was funny.  but anyway...yeah- they were all laughing at me and madeline who sits next to me was cracking up saying "hahahahahahaha! i cant believe they did that! hahahahaha!" i think they may freaked out mr. shapiro too. i'd be confused too if a gang of kids were at my door poiting and yelling at one of my students for no reason i know of. god that was so embarrassing. i actually started shaking. im such a dumbass. i thik i'll just avoid those guys on monday. too bad bobby cant even spell my name right. oh well. common mistake.  drama drama drama.

      mood:tired music: "talk shows on mute"-incubus  its friday the 13th. take a shot. drink it down.  we had the day off today due to teacher development day. i stayed home, did chores, played with make-up (purple eye make-up rox my sox), and then nursed caroline back to health. mom brought her home mid-day b/c she was complaining of a friggin' fever. i gave her her meds and then she slept a bit while i popped in a couple DVD's.  yeah. thats right. we gots a DVD player now, homes!  anyhoo, im babysitting Livvy now. on the way over Caroline puked. and yes, kudos to me for smart thinking- i put three bags into one in case she tossed cookies. well she did and only caroline thanked me. i think mom needs to stop trashing me and take a look at everything i do for this family. when caroline started throwing up, she blamed me for giving her the bug just b/c earlier this week, i wasnt feeling so hot. alright...i dont want to get into this. long story short- mom wants me to be more like caroline, likes to trash me, and i cant go to winter semi-formal at the zoo b/c of that fart-ass i call mother. resentment is in the air and it smells like shit.  im spending the night at Ceilidh's house sunday night with her and Sarah. then monday there's no school due to president's day so we're going to 23rd to shop our asses off. i do need less of an ass, so i plan to shop it off. yes.  im gonna go now. later gators!

"hello addie- i have been watching  you from afar and am interested in you. -your secret admirer w.s."  wow. i totally knew who that was when i read it.

      mood: chilled (and ready to serve. lol. im dumb) music: "powder"-yellowcard  im at ceilidh's house. its fun.  we dyed my hair and of course it looks awesome. its like bright reddish orange and, again, its awesome.  when i got here, we went to Walgreens and got my pictures developed. i first noticed something was fishy when i was chrged $11. 74 or something like that for my pictures. i thought i was going to be paying 7.99. and then something else was wrong. i knew it. i let ceilidh and sarah and have the honor of the first look at the pics and they were saying, "um, addie, all your pictures are of your dog...more pictures of your dog..." so took a look and noticed that the stack a was a bit heavy. so i went through and then came to grips with the harsh idiocy of mind.  IT WAS THE WRONG FUCKIN' ROLL!!!   i asked for double exposures and i thought it wa only 24 exposures. nevermind me thinking i had the right roll of film. i could not be more pissed. i wasted my fucking money on stupid pictures from christmas!  stupid motherfucking god! i hate you! again, why do you hate me so much?!?!?!?! first, you make me fat, and then you make me grab the wrong roll of film!!!  goddammit. i fuckin gypped myself.  god i am ever so pissed!!!!  AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!! i hate you jesus! you fuckin shitface!!!!  damn. let it out. let it all out.  i blame the rain. the rain and jesus. fuckin hippie. think you're so cool with your robe and birkenstocks (no offense to birks), and your stupid wannabe Eric Clapton facial hair. nobody likes you. you suck.  YOU ARE NOT MY HOMEBOY.  no matter what the t-shirt says.  im gonna go have fun now.   i saw The Ring for the first time tonight and it scared me something bad. after the movie was over, we went up and hung out in ceilidh's room and called ppl and said, "7 days..." just like the movie. and then when we were done, her TV buzzed like it was about to turn on. it was off...or so we thought. it was so scary. we ran out into the hall screaming and then we all collapsed on top of one another laughing and practically wet ourselves. then will walks in and just looks at us then keeps walking. yeah. we deserved that. it was pretty creepy though.  if you've seen the ring, you would understand how scary it is when TV's just turn on by themsleves.  or even buzz like they're about to. yeah.  damn that was scary    i smell hella good.

I AM NO ONE'S BITCH! ...except when it comes to a certain hot male celebrity. but thats only b/c i have no other train of thought or sense when that hot body's around. thats just a given, folks. c'mon.

THAT'S 7 FUCKIN' HOURS!!! no way. besides, i have some personal business to attend to. i gotta get the stink outta my sweatshirt. good thing i didnt lean on anything last night. i would have left looking like Yetti or something.  anyhoo...about the hair coloring. i want it to really set in- not like how my mom only let me set for 10 minutes. there was barely any change there. so yeah. i want my whole head just really fuckin' saturated in it. its this light auburn-blonde-ish color. its fuckin awesome. cant wait to try it.  i just realized how much i like to use the f-word. i also just realized how lame it sounds to say "f-word" instead of just saying the f-word plain and simple.  i write more later, no? you pretty like-a your ma  ma!

"we eat Quakers for breakfast" (Quakers are our rival school's mascot) "those are some some kick-ass pants!"

(tennis team was throwing money filled balls into the crowds) "someones going to break their neck!!!" (ppl were lunging for the $ balls in the bleachers)  i said so many things i cant even remeber all of them. but i do know i was the loudest one there. ask my [annoyed] friends.  "shut up!" -madeline, sarah, and a few unspirited strangers.  i've got some fucking school spirit. i love chs warriors ok?   yeah today was a good day. i heard a funny story about wesley yesterday, but i dont i i'll post it b/c im just a damn considerate person like that.  so yeah...today was fun. and this morning josh and i reconciled and we're good now. for awhile we hated eachother...long story. but now we're gravy.  pep assemblies are so damn cool.   announcement: ladies and gentlemen of the germy- i have decided that next year im going to be a cheerleader...if i make it. yes, ok. you can say all you want about the cheerleaders, but i can guarantee that i will never be a mean, bitchy, clique-obsessed, overly tanned barbie.  i will be cool. i am cool.  later

How can I describe how I feel everytime I hear "The Immigrant Song"? Hmmm...I'll try my damndest. Whenever I hear any song by the Zeppelin, I feel all tingly inside...i get a warm, tingly feeling. I feel the music running through my veins and I just want to go dance naked in the streets and give some bum a couple dollars...or maybe just 0.50 cents if im feeling only a little generous.  Goddammit. Who can compare to Led Zeppelin? Yeah, that's right bitch... NO ONE. I feel overwhelmed (but in a good way) with a feeling of happiness when I hear even the faintest whisper of Robert Plant's sweet sweet vocals.  My heart beats to the rythmic rhythms of John Bonham's glorious drumming.   Who can compare?  NO ONE......     BITCH.

Jake gave me a ride back to ceilidh's house. i won't go into detail, but let's just say no one was in a hurry to leave the car.  it was nice. very nice.  ceilidh and sarah made up an insanely elaborate, yet believable, lie about where i was and why i wasn't with them when c's parents came to pick us up. it was ruined when they came into their driveway and they saw me get out of jake's car. ceilidh and sarah yelled out, "holy shit! what the hell?"   oops.  oh well, it was worth it.

(just kidding...the only hoe-ing i do is in the garden. lol). i dont know... all i know is that i like him and i think we might have a lot in common. plus, i go to school with his sister and she updates me on him and tells me what he says about me...like something about a kiss...  i'll save that for later.

Mullet lived in a trailer park (or as the p.c. assholes call it, a "mobile community") and one day he thought, "Hey, my cousin, Pete, is a landscaper. maybe he can take a weed-wacker to my head." Joe couldn't decide how he wanted his hair styled, long or short? it was the question of the day. he simply could not come to a conclusion, so he decided that he wanted both long and short hair. he had a semi-conservative look in the front and then a party in the back, with which he could braid, perm, and style. he of course named it after his classy self; therefore, calling it the "mullet".

      mood:fine music:"They"- Gem  we had a multi-cultural assembly today and it was pretty good. all the minority groups were put in the spotlight and each group had stuff to say, perform, and a slide show to boot.  anyhoo, after the assembly, we had a 15 minute passing time so i went around to shit the time. we were on our way to global studies, when we see Will, Wesley, Bobby and a few other dudes walk in just when the bell was about to ring. they were all holding a Slurpee from 7-11.   thats a fucking good idea. why go to a fuckin assembly when you can just skip and go to a quikie mart? i want to do that next time.   i want a fuckin' slurpee, dammit.

THEY'RE HYPNOTIZING HER!!!!!!!!!    HOLY FUCK, DUDES. THIS IS THE CRAZIEST SHIT I HAVE EVER SEEN. MAYBE THEY  ARE  ON 'SHROOMS....

Lacey, you are one foxy, mothafuckin' babushka.  love, ninjabitch  tomorrow im going to bake a cake.

      mood: stuffed like a thanksgiving tofurkey (tofu-turkey) music:"life in a glasshouse"- Radiohead  why do people care about what others do with their own lives? if someone makes a decision that affects them and them only, then why do others make it so that that the matter affects them? i think it's b/c they have no life of their own or their own matters with which to keep themselves occupied. why must you try to live in my world?   GET OUT. NOW. INTRUDERS UNWELCOME.  if something i decide to do doesnt affect you, then dont make it as if it does. what's the point? if it doesnt have any impact on your life whatsoever, then butt out, butt first. it makes no sense to me. what is wrong with people?  but, if you simply  must  involve yourself in other people's lives, maybe you should tell that person, instead of going around telling everyone else  but   that person. that accomplishes nothing. nothing but drama. stop the drama. for the love of god, be chill.  stop your terrorist attacks on my world's trade centers. stop your drama. stop your intrusions. just stop.

      mood:worn out from a stupid week and stupid people music:"under pressure"-Queen   so yeah. this week was a roughish week. i get news wednesday night that a certain someone with a livejournal posted some awful things about me (some things i told her in confidence) and disgusting assumptions about a person she doesnt even know. im not going into detail about what was said, but it was hurtful to me and the other person. it disturbs me how unaware of others' feelings some people can be. how can people grow to be that cold and hard? anyhoo. i was so cut up inside that i just could not bring myself to go to school the next day. i simply did not want anything to do with this person. jake, being the caring person he is, picked me up the next morning and brought me a treat....HOMEMADE RICE KRISPIES, BIATCH!!!  how awesome can you get?! well, in jake's case, even more awesome. he really made my day on thursday. i was pretty down yesterday, so we went around aimlessly looking for trouble to cheer me up. we went to Trader Joe's (again) and got more mochi. Ahhh..the breakfast of champions *cue the infamous Queen song they play at burgerville 24/7*. so then i suggested seeing Envy b/c it looks like a good-ass movie. we drove around and spotted a portland tribune. i run out, snatch one, then run- baywatch style- back to the car. i opened it in hopes of finding movie listings..but no. what do i find? a picture of fat chicks in cheerleading outfits waving their poms poms hig and proud. god, that was hot. not really though. it totally killed my horny...for a couple minutes. well, we couldnt find movie listings, so we went to 2 different theatres. we found that no mainstream theatre is open before 2 'o'clock. yeah...it was like 10:30 at the time.  ok, i know it sounds boring, but i was totally entertained the whole time. we made a run to Fred Meyers and used jake's gift cards. he bought me candy and Cosmo. "aaaaaww...no..." he said. but he bought it anyway *whip cracks* just kidding....or am i? lol  jake bought a kick-ass Queen DVD and we watched that. i must say, it was kick ass.   freddy mercury w/ moustache vs. freddy sans moustache with the 'stache. all the way.

      mood: in hysterics music: "toxic"-britney spears  i gotta say...jake and lucas singing toxic by britney spears is the hottest thing i have ever heard. it sounded insanely righteous. they should record that along with a couple other covers of the same genre...or even just britney covers....and sell them.  that's some big money right there, bitch  today was an exceptionally good day. i was having lunch with lacey and laura, and we stood in line waiting to get some bento (Mmmm...sodium...), when we see Bobby and Wesley standing in line too. they had some "assassin" game going on and i had no idea what the hell it was. i stole Lacey's weapon (a microscopic squirt gun) and shot Wesley right in the noggin. i laughed and then he mocked me. we went to the CHS mall to sit and eat. Bobby and Wesley come over and sit and we chat. i got shot a few times by bobby and i shot him back...i missed, but i shot his chair so he had to wipe it off. im hard core. Why was Wesley wearing a G-Unit shirt? yeah...i thought it was kinda gay, but it was just  soooo  becoming on Wes.  "we should hang out some time"-bobby the following quote made me happy.  jake and i went to trader joes again and got some more MOCHI!!!!! this time we got mango. next time...we get some fuckin' chocolate. i ate my share of the mochi (3 balls i ate 3 balls )  before we even got back to his house. damn. what? they were really really good! hey, at least i had the grace to leave him the last two...and enough grace to say "excuse me" after my tiny belch.  jake- you ain't heard nothin' yet, bitch.  ; o P

      mood: ready to burst music:"rush of blood to the head"- coldplay  i wonder what it would be like if i had freedom.  freedom from my mother would be grand. i would actually have a life.  i feel so caged in. like im locked in my tower away from the world.  people always say that they wish they could just have more alone time. why? i have too much. i wish i had less time by myself and more time with friends. do you know how much this is going to fuck me up later on in life? i'll be in my 30's talking to my shrink about how much my mom screwed me up. now, i know mothers are easy targets, but i can totally understand where these people are coming from. mothers can fuck you up something bad by the time you're born. i know  my  mama did.  i want to go party... i want freedom.

      mood: wishing i was partying music: "here in my room"- incubus  It's so unfortunate that im babysitting right now.  i spent some time over at jake's the other day and then i lost track of time. Darren was so kind and drove this little piggy home. they said something about a party last night and/or tonight.  i fuckin' hate it when my mother volunteers me for babysitting. this is why i have no life. i mean, i thoroughly enjoy the money, but when i would  rather go party, get drunk, and possibly get laid ...then i would like to seize the opportunity.  i want to party. damn i'm horny.

      mood:nervous. my world is so dark. music:the thumping of my own heart beating heavily against my chest.  i got caught. i didnt tell my mom that my job was cancelled on monday, and then when gigi tried to get a hold of me, she called my house after trying my cell. me, being a stupid idiot, didnt bring my purse the one time. it was only for about 5 minutes, and when i got back, i found that she had called and also that my mother had left a message. she sounded pissed. i called her back and she asked where i am...  me: hi, mom. im coming home right now. her: where are you?! me: um, i'm at gigi's. her: no you're not! she just called asking for you! where are you?! me: i'm at ceilidh's... her: let me talk to ceilidh's mom! me: im coming home right now. her: let me talk to ceilidh's mom!!! me: ok! im not at ceilidh's! im at my friend, jake spears' house! her:let me talk to his parents!  i go inside and hand the phone to his mom. she talks to my mother as jake and i stand there. i was shaking so hard. i still am. shes contemplating seending me back to new orleans. if not, then i'll be leaving cleveland. thats not the answer. she has pulled me in and out of so many fucking schools, its ridiculous. chs is the first school i've ever been really happy attending. i cant stand this. she says leaving the situation doesnt make things better, so how does that make sending me away a good idea?  i guess she thinks that shes so genius that whatever she does is right, but if i make the same decision, is wrong in every way.  she accused me of endangering my sisters life, my dogs life, and my own life. "what if jakes friends raped you?!!! whatif jake raped you?!!!" she always assumes the worst of the world and is irrational about everything. she doesnt know people, yet she's just so sure that theyre the worst human beings. she needs to be killed.

"i had sex in a space cauldron full of automic sewage sluts. it was hot from the radiation and my ass is green and slimy. Glow butts are the new trend in Ptown. Go jump in a vat of slime. Everyone will like you. im cool...your not. I rock...you roll. good day addie" -jake  i got 4 new shirts. each one was 99 cents. its the shit. enjoy yours, ceilidh!  fuck my ass..... what else.... oh yeah. my mom doesnt know that my babysitting job was cancelled today, so im hanging with jake and maybe a few of his funny-faced friends. i miss paulrus. he's in the midwest. why? my stepdad lives in iowa. who would want to drown in a sea of plaid and fields of corn? i hate corn now. thank you, midwesterners.

      mood:pissed...yet happy to be with someone other than the bitch. music:the sound of jake playing his guitar in the next room  wow. no update in a long time. damn. ok, so to sum up what has happened since my last update......  -got caught having sex in someone's driveway (in a car). -alomost left home to live with ceilidh. mother wanted me to, but everytime i called her bluff, she would say, "you're not leaving. i couldn't be more serious."  i want to kill that bitch so bad. i dont regret punching her and telling her to fuck off. i hate her guilt trips and how she always wants to talk about bad things. she must enjoy contributing to the world's crazy factor. she IS the world's crazy factor. i hate her more than ever. i want out of that house. if i leave, she'll report me and i'll be sent to juvie. i hate her. i hate her. i hate her. i hate her.  did i mention i hate her?  someone, anyone, should break in at night, shoot her dead, leave, shoot my father dead, wherever he is, and then take me to ceilidh's to live. that person will be my best friend.

      mood:pent up rage about to burst out of my chest like that alien thingy in Alien. music:"make yourself"- incubus  the other day- i think it was monday- my mom had the day off so my plans to have friends over to smoke a bowl was aborted. my mother- being the fat bitch that she is- wanted to vegetate all day and stay inside watching TV. i hate staying indoors. im a creature of the wild and i can't help who i am. so i go downstairs and here's what went down...  me: (tap moms shoulder to wake her up) mom? bitch: what?! me: can i go for a bike ride? bitch: no. youre grounded. you've misbehaved this summer.  i then went back upstairs and cried myself to sleep. i slept for an accumulated 15 hours that day. i had nothing to do. i couldnt even ride my bike? so, what... am i grounded from exercise and fresh air too? we just watched dr. phil tell some fat chicks to exercise more.  i guess im grounded from friends, the world outside the house, and my sanity. im going insane. please. somebody. anybody...kill her!!!
