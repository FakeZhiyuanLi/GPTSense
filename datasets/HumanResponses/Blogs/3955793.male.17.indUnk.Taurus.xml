         No, that's not it. That's the one I currently have. Hey, if it was free when I got it  2 years ago , then anything would be an upgrade. But here's the phone that I'm talking about. It's "supposably" comming out real soon now. I hate that. Gimme a freakin' release date already. Q3 is not a release date. It's not even a release month. It's a release three-months. So I'm supposed to plan my phone contract around possibly July, August, or even September. Please.   Anyway. back to the phone itself. It's so cool. It has my favorite iPod shaped rounded-rectangle form. It has a camera. An outer LCD. And inner color screen. A QWERTY keyboard, after you open it up like a book (not a clamshell). So cool. WML mini web browser. And some other stuff. Just look at the pictures.        I love this phone. It would be great to get a much needed update on this phone. I do a google search for this thing and come up with the same sites day after day. Some sites still claim that it runs WindowsMobile, or that it has a SD media slot, or whatever. It doesn't. Jeez. Oh, if you want to see more of it, other than the three pics currently out on the web, it makes a cameo in the Black Eyed Peas video for "Let's Get It Started" somwhere in the middle of the song.  I love you, Motorola a630.

       Later, or maybe it was before. Whenever. Sacramento's wife and daughter came out of the building. When they passed, I gave a polite smile and looked back toward the plants. Then what's-her-name, "Yatzee" said "Bye Jaysin" to me as if we were best friends or something. I was kinda caught off guard and I was just like "Bye, [whatever your name is]". It was kinda weird. Who told her my name?  Then at lunch, I was just minding my own business up at the pool when these two guys who were installing some stuff in the fitness room came up there. They walked around, looked over the edge of the building, and turned around. The mexican-immigrant looking dude said something to me in spanish.  I looked up [not really] at him and said "What?" clearly in english. Then the retard just repeated whatever he said (in spanish) with that mexican heavy, mumbly, through-the-teeth accent. he pointed at the pool as he said it so I figured he made some comment about it. I was like "Yeah", answering a possibly non-question. He said something else to the other guy as they reached the door. I think they started laughing. But whatever; they left, which was all I cared about. Idiot guys.   After work, we went to Dominick's to buy some stuff for the empty fridge. We walked up the icecream aisle and I picked up a gallon of chocolate. There was this lady there, next to me, with like three kids. As I reached to put it in the cart, she looked at me and said "Is that for me?" I was so confused. I was like "who the hell are you, lady?" But she looked familiar. It took me a while to figure out that it was one of the lunch ladies from sophomore year. We all laughed and got over it. Afterwards, we had some KFC. The coleslaw spilled into the other compartments of the tray. it was kinda nasty-looking. We proceeded to have a nice evening.  It was fun having to go record two hours of Last Comic Standing, while watching yesterday's recorded Summerland, followed by today's new episode. Besides the complex system of VCRs and VHS tapes, with the combination of 3 TVs and impecable timing, it was nice and quiet without my sisters around. Nice quality time with mom.

       Let's talk about my day. Yeah. A lot of stuff happened and the sad part is that I probably won't remember most of it even to just write it down now. So like at 10:00 this morning, I started watering in front as usual. But of course, something had to come up. That idiot guy that sells Streetwise newspaper was there with his stupid little backpack standing in front of Peet's coffee. He was in my way the whole time. And he kept on standing on the hose. I felt like drenching him. That'll show him to stand on stuff. So it was all hot and sunny, being July and all, so I'm being real careful about giving sufficient amounts of water to all the little plants. Everything was fine until the idiot guy came up to me and was like, "Are you gonna water those again?" I had already reached the farthest group of plants to water. So I turned to look at him and did one of those faces that Q does. Like, "Duh, of course I am, idiot." And I said "When I go back. [duh, idiot.]" because of course, I had to go back to the hose wagon thing and roll up the hose anyway. Why wouldn't I water the plants on my way back. Idiot. Anyway....  So I was all done with that side of the street, watering-wise. So, I rolled up the hose and started back. The guy was still watching me all creepily and stuff. Then it happened -- all of a sudden. The old hose busted. I started shooting water everywhere, in every direction. I tried to stop it by grabbing it but the water sprayed through my fingers. I even tried bending the hose to stop the water flow, but apparently that wasn't enough to stop the leak. So I wheeled the stupid leaky [to say the least] hose in front of the building (with the idiot guy watching me, of course) and just gave up. I let the damn thing spray all over the place and just called the office. I was like "can you send someone out here. I have a bit of a problem." So Yuri and Michael came out and whatever. Tried to fix it (and failed). So they just shut off the water and replaced the old hose. It actually went alright. After the whole fiasco, I just continued watering like nothing happened. The idiot guy was still down the street. I think he put a curse on me or something for that to have happened. I  was  giving him dirty looks like crazy. But he deserved it! He kept standing on the hose. Idiot.

       So many points to make today. First off, the thing at the frontmost of my thought processes -- the new 4th generation iPod. It looks so cool and sleek and cool. I always imagined that they would integrate that strange buttonwheel thing into a new non-mini iPod. The thing that caught me by surprise was that it came out today. For some reason my 3rd gen iPod still seems new to me, even tho I got it at Christmas. Yup 7 months old already. I got kinda mad at it 'cause it fell out of its case and onto the pavement. Twice. It got a little scratched up around the front edges. No biggie. So anyway, while I was reading about the new cool sleek iPod, I read this rumor about a 60GB iPod. Hmm. Sometime in September (which means Christmastime in Apple terms). I was thinking about giving mom my current one and I'll just buy the new one in September [aka December]. She agreed as long as she didn't have to pay anything. Typical mom. Always on a budget.

       Today was kind of an up and down day. It started off okay I guess, for a Monday. The weekend just went by too fast. I didn't feel like going to work today. But I tried to make the best of it and it was fine. But it was so hot. Who wants to stand outside for 2 hours in the middle of July? Everyday? For the whole summer? Apparently I do.  At around 10:30, as I was basking in the heat, I saw this Sherwin-Williams truck pull up in front of the building. Then it happened -- I saw the cutest guy in the world. He's the hottest paint delivery guy I have ever seen. This time, he only had to deliver one thing of paint, not 10 like last time. But it was better this time around.  He let himself into the building without seeing me stare at him. So I continued to water the plants and specifically positioned myself facing the door. I looked at his white smile and he said something like "Hey buddy, how's it going?" And I think I said something to the likes of "Good. How you doin'?" with 75% Joey Tribiani pronunciation. I felt so stupid after I said it but I was still shocked that he talked to me. He started the conversation. Did he actually say "buddy"? Probably not. I don't remember 'cause I was lost in his eyes. Those big beautiful blue eyes. Anyway... He is so damn hot. He looks just a couple years older than me. Maybe like 19 or so. He is so polite. He said thank you like 5 times for holding the door open for him before. I'd be extremely surprised if he didn't have like 50 girlfriends. I'd be extremely intrigued if he had 50 boyfriends.  He is so hot. I feel like ordering some more paint everyday just to see his cute little tush. That made me love my job.  But of course, as all moments are eventually spoiled... the Monday just got to me. My muscles were all ache-y, and I was all yawn-y. I didn't feel like doing anything at all. But in the end, it all turned out okay. I still have the memories of mystery-name paint delivery boy, and luckily not too many of the Whole Foods idiots.  Things like this -- people like him -- these are what inspire my blog. I have to jot these memories down before I forget them (and I will). Sometimes I love like. Other times I hate it. But as always, you have to take the good with the bad.
