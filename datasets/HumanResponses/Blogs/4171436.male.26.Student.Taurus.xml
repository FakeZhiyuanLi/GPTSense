       I haven't been able to find the translation to Prieto's article, nor the two excerpts from de Saussure's "General Course in Linguistics" that go here. Benveniste's part did appear in Google, but only as a quote in a paid article. So, bad luck.   Here's my scheme:

       .    Question ...question...       Sol,   Did you mean that we will talk about all the three theorists you have mentioned on Saturday itself? I think more than that we need to talk about some general things on saturday ....and really 'start' with the texts (which will be smooth and swift once we have this intro. session) from next week .   What do you think?    And oh ya...I've commented a lot on other posts , please go through them          And yet another thing...the title 'semiology' showing in two lines does not look good to me can you make it appear in one single line or change it to signs or something like that( a shorter name I mean)

         Day 1 in 15 ideas      Note: This was done before reading the English translation of the texts, and definitely before reading anything but my compulsory textbook. It's simply my memorisation guide and I am posting it as a skeleton to build from :) .  [ ***  marks the subjects I don't see so clearly, and therefore might be good places to start discussing from]   de Saussure:      Language is a sign system and therefore comparable to writing and deaf-signing, etc. However, it is  the most important of sign systems    Therefore we can conceive a  science that would study the sign inside social life, Semiology . Such science would be a branch of social Psychology.    Linguistics  would be a  branch  of this science, and Semiology's laws would apply to it and therefore define its  domain as that of human acts .     Prieto      The term Semiology went back to light in  1943  when  Buyssens  decides to go on with the saussurian project . Until hen other linguistics had established laws that not only governed languages, but also other sign systems (and this would be the base).   Buyssens decides that the  limits  of Semiology would be those defined by him as the  "communicative act" . Every act of language is a communicative act but not the other way around. Semiology is, then, an  extended Linguistics     From here there are  two branches  or movements. One of them is centripetal, starts  from Semiology  and uses it  to  better understand  language . It's the  Semiology of communication . The  second one  is centrifugal (was born in the sixties) and starts  from language  to understand, through Semiology,  other acts . This is the Semiology of Signification, or even better,  Semiology of Connotation .     Barthes      ***  We can't say that there are other  systems of signs  that have enough amplitude. As soon as we try to find any with  enough psychological depth , we go back to  language . Objects, images and behaviours do signify, but never by themselves.   *** For example, the  visual substance  uses language to reinforce its signifiers, and at least part of it is in a  relationship of "relevo" (relay)   with the language. Also,  objects  become  systems through language , for it defines its significants and separates its signifiers.  We're a civilization of the written word, so it's difficult to imagine any other system of images or objects whose meaning is outside language. Sooner or later  through Semiology we find language again , not only as a model, but as a component, "relevo" (relay) and meaning. But this is not the same language of the linguist.  Its units are the longer fragments of speech , and therefore they signify "under" language but never without it.   Therefore,  Semiology  might be destined to be  absorbed into Trans-Linguistics , whose object would be the signifying groups made of articulate language. Ergo, we might be able to  turn around de Saussure's proposition : it's not Linguistics a part of Semiology, but  Semiology a part of Linguistics , the part that studies the bigger signifying units of discourse.   From here there are  two branches  of study, the  Syntagmatic  one, which deals with the  analysis of the structure of the message , and the  Paradigmatic  one which takes care of the  classification of the units of connotation.  They come together in the "message", their intersection point.     Jakobson      According to him any communicative act has six elements:  Destinador  ( addresser , the one who sends the message),  Mensaje  ( Message ),  Destinatario  ( addressee , the one who receives it),  Contexto  ( Context , the referent, should be able to be understood by the addressee, and verbal or able to be verbalized),  Contacto  ( Contact , a physical channel and a psychological connection) and  CÃ³digo  ( Code , common at least partly to addresser and addressee).     Prieto     Something becomes an  Index  (indicator?) when from proving that it belongs to a certain class we can derive that another event belongs to another class.  There are three categories:  Spontaneous  (they give indications without having been meant to, such as in nature or involuntary acts),  Falsely Spontaneous  (give indications and were meant to, but must not show that, like an actor faking an accent), and  Intentional  (give indications having been meant to AND show they were meant to do so).   An  autonomous intentional index  is a  signal . The  use of signals defines communication . An  act of communication is when a sender, when producing a signal, tries to give an indication to the receiver . The study of that indication of the base of Semiology of Communication.

        Will, I have found several of the excerpts of my textbook online and in English, so I am pasting them here, along with their URLs for added depth. This is one day of studying for me (even though the two longest articles are missing from here), and I plan to do one of this 4 times a week, for 14 weeks. I will post 10 to 20 important points of each "reading group", and will read the URL info. I hope to maintain two or three day readings ahead so that you have time to read yourself and we can discuss. I was thinking of leaving this one for Saturday, and in the meantime I'll try to get things started and rolling. Sol. PS: Blogger is eating my posts so I will probably not post much more right now       urlLink De Saussure    Language is a system of signs that express ideas and is thus comparable to the system of writing, to the alphabet of deaf-mutes, to symbolic rituals, to forms of etiquette, to military signals, etc. It is but the most important of these systems.   We can therefore imagine a science which would study the life of signs within society ... We call it semiology, from the Greek semeion ('sign'). It would teach us what signs consist of, what laws govern them. Since it does not yet exist we cannot say what it will be; but it has a right to existence; its place is assured in advance. Linguistics is only part of this general science; and the laws which semiology discovers will be applicable to linguistics, which will thus find itself attached to a well-defined domain of human phenomena. (Course in General Linguistics, p. 16)    ***Prieto Missing Here***     urlLink Barthes    Now it is far from certain that in the social life of today there are to be found any extensive systems of signs outside human language. Semiology has so far concerned itself with codes of no more than slight interest, such as the Highway Code; the moment we go on to systems where the sociological significance is more than superficial, we are once more confronted with language. It is true that objects, images and patterns of behaviour can signify, and do so on a large scale, but never autonomously; every semiological system has its linguistic admixture. Where there is a visual substance, for example, the meaning is confirmed by being duplicated in a linguistic message (which happens in the case of the cinema, advertising, comic strips, press photography, etc.) so that at least a part of the iconic message is, in terms of structural relationship, either redundant or taken up by the linguistic system. As for collections of objects (clothes, food), they enjoy the status of systems only in so far as they pass through the relay of language, which extracts their signifiers (in the form of nomenclature) and names their signifieds (in the forms of usages or reasons): we are, much more than in former times, and despite the spread of pictorial illustration, a civilisation of the written word. Finally, and in more general terms, it appears increasingly more difficult to conceive a system of images and objects whose signifieds can exist independently of language: to perceive what a substance signifies is inevitably to fall back on the individuation of a language: there is no meaning which is not designated, and the world of signifieds is none other than that of language.  Thus, though working at the outset on nonlinguistic substances, semiology is required, sooner or later, to find language (in the ordinary sense of the term) in its path, not only as a model, but also as component, relay or signified. Even so, such language is not quite that of the linguist: it is a second-order language, with its unities no longer monemes or phonemes, but larger fragments of discourse referring to objects or episodes whose meaning underlies language, but can never exist independently of it. Semiology is therefore perhaps destined to be absorbed into a trans-linguistics, the materials of which may be myth, narrative, journalism, or on the other hand objects of our civilisation, in so far as they are spoken (through press, prospectus, interview, conversation and perhaps even the inner language, which is ruled by the laws of imagination). In fact, we must now face the possibility of inverting Saussure's declaration: linguistics is not a part of the general science of signs, even a privileged part, it is semiology which is a part of linguistics: to be precise, it is that part covering the great signifying unities of discourse. By this inversion we may expect to bring to light the unity of the research at present being done in anthropology, sociology, psychoanalysis and stylistics round the concept of signification.   ***Missing Paragraph***     urlLink  Jakobson   six 'constitutive factors... In any act of verbal communication' thus:  The addresser sends a message to the addressee. To be operative the message requires a context referred to ('referent' in another, somewhat ambivalent, nomenclature), seizable by the addressee, and either verbal or capable of being verbalized, a code fully, or at least partially, common to the addresser and addressee (or in other words, to the encoder and decoder of the message); and finally, a contact, a physical channel and psychological connection between the addresser and the addressee, enabling both of them to stay in communication   ***Scheme here***    Prieto
