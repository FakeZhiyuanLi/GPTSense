      I've revised my topic for my first qualitative research study. I'll be working a paper that looks to explore the longevity of the DVD format. The simple way of how DVD technology isn't just a transitional format from VHS to the next new medium, such as direct download or something else even flashier. Considering I've only got 28 days left to come up with something nothing less than stellar, I've got to get my ass in gear. Along with this paper, I'm working on several projects at Media Services as well as undertaking a free lance job here and there. I'm hoping I haven't filled my plate up too much.

      Sounds like a fun thing huh... Apparantly it defines the connections between various texts be it film, television, or standard print. Many levels to it, which I'm only soaking up a little at a time. I have however finally (I think) found a suitable hypothesis and topic for my fairly large research project that I now have a little over a month to complete. Time to hit the media service archives, library, and hosts of other online knowledge sites. Good luck me.

      I've read one of two articles for class on Wednesday. The article I read was confusing as hell, I can't lie. Reading works written for academia is going to become vary tiresome in a short time. This particular article looked at semiotics as it relates to filmtext. What does that mean? Good question, I'm not sure myself yet. I guess I'll have some good questions in class on Wednesday.   Tomorrow, I'll be spending 10 hours at work. Working as a G.A. in media services is about the only thing I look forward to right now. Yeah it's work, but I love editing and when I actually have projects I'm working on, time moves at a faster pace. Sitting in an edit suite is relaxing I guess.

      Greetings and Salutations. I'm not new to the blog, but this blog is new to me. In celebration, recognition, etc, to my new life as a graduate student, I've decided to create a new blog. This blog will be a record of my journey as I attempt to make it through my program at Northern Illinois University. If all goes to plan, I'll have my M.A. within two years. Along the way, I'll be sharing my thoughts and feelings regarding school and what goes along with it. For those of you who are interested in my other blog, feel free to check it out at www.christophermcpherson.com. I plan on creating a new look to this standard design in the next few weeks whenever time permits.
