      Well I'm back, SP2 for windows decided that it didn't like the fact that my PC was functional and swiftly took steps to correct the matter. Long story short, I stumped myself and Microsoft tech support, I couldn't even get past the loading screen, and safe mode wouldn't load. So I had to take it into the shop to get the HDD wiped. I also passed my aptitude and physical test for the Canadian Armed Forces, I'm glad it's over, the physical wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I'm on vacation for the next two weeks, nice to have sometime off.

      If you live in Canada you've probably heard that a Wal-Mart in Quebec has unionized, I won't get into the details or anything, I'll just say that while I have no real desire to have my store unionized I am hoping that this will scare the hirer ups and maybe start paying their employees a decent salary, I mean it's pretty sad when your full timers don't make enough to live on their own.

      13 more days until my vacation, not like I'll be going anywhere but It'll be nice to have the two weeks off. I'm downloading the beta for the new Warhammer 40k game, should be interesting, last time I beta tested a game it was Everquest for the PS2, I didn't like it, it was my first experience with a MMORPG and it really do anything for me. I do enjoy FFXI, but I think it's in part due to the fact it's based on a series I already know and enjoy. I remember a few years ago Bandai said the they were going to release a Gundam MMO, when I heard that I quickly and promptly  urlLink pissed  myself. Honestly the only thing I would have enjoyed more would've been a Macross MMO, unfortunately Bandai canned it, should have know it was too good to be true. Well talk to ya later.

      Well this is my first, my first step on the highway known as blogging. Not going to write much right now put. Anything you want to learn about me is in my profile. However I will say this, if you work in retail you have to watch the program Airline, those people deal with the same crap we do and it's pretty damn funny.
