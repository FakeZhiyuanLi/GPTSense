       Online gaming, don't you just love it?    Me, I am still waiting for a certain football game to be online... wonder what that could be?    Anyways, my experience of online gaming has been mostly the useless 56Kbps user. This is has since been rectified and I am now a member of the elite ( L337 ), playing games on broadband.   Has this new high speed connection improved my gaming experience, nope, nada, nien, not a thing! I am still as good now, as I was on a 56K connection, I now getting beaten quicker... and more often!    The current game that gives me this joy is Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow on Xbox Live! Some of you will know, and some will not, the finer details and issues this multiplayer experience brings and I won't bore you with the details. Currently this is my experience, when I play as a Spy I am in total fear of getting caught that I spend most of my time skulking around, trying not to get shot at, instead of actually doing the mission. Conversely, when I am a Merc, my time is spent looking for cannon fodder... unsuccessfully.    Am I rubbish, I don't think so, I believe my problem is that I'm trying to 'run' before I can 'walk' although having said that, I really believe I should learn to 'crawl' first...

       Games! I play them, I play them a lot! In fact too much!    I've decided its time to share my experiences and opinions on this very subject. I'm going to rant, rave, complain, praise about games. I am not of the disposition that people must read this lonely meandering but it makes me happy to know I've said my part.  May the force be with you... always.

      I love my football games, well one series in particular,Winning Eleven / Pro Evolution Soccer from Konami.  KCEJ, the creators of this series, not to be confused with the inferior ISS creators KCET, know football, infact they love football. I reckon they sit in the office all day making the game, then after work playing football, and at the weekend (or whenever the J-League plays) watching football. Football flows through their life. I want to work with these guys, I want to be a part of this fascinating footballing empire.  Winning Eleven 8 is closer to the football I know. The basic game model is passing, WE7 and PES 2 & PES 3 were about dribbling and tricks, more so in PES 3. As in real football good passing teams can play other teams of the park, and this is more the case in WE8. Teams that pass the ball make the opportunities to score goals.  This plays into my hands, ISS PES 2 was the last time there was such an emphasis on passing, I was renowned for my thru-balls from my own half splitting the defence in an instant. My Jedi like ability to thread the ball thru or over a defence made me one of the top players to play with. I loved to supply other players with goal scoring opportunities. WE 8 is already proving my Jedi Thru-Ball is back and in devastating form! WE8 features so many gameplay improvements in a yearly title; flicks, more tricks, slicker passing, use of the outside of the foot, improved ball control, referee advantage, and more I know I haven't experienced.  The graphics engine has been overhauled, players look more slight and agile, more animations have been added, the goal keepers acrobatics have been more than complimented.  Giving that there are more animations it stands to reason that there are more tricks, this is soooo true! Standing step-overs, spot turns, lofted outside-of-the-boot chips, pushing, shoulder dips, more shot variety, free kick set pieces. So much has been added.  Although it sounds like WE 8 is perfect, this is unfortunately not the case, sslloowwddoowwnn! Why do the Japanese put up with slowdown? I have no idea! Anyways the slowdown occurs in places where most of the players congruate, corners! For such a place slowdown has to occur, a corner situation is not it. Lets just hope that PES 4 does not suffer such slowdown. (My fingers are well and truly crossed)  Once I get my copy I will procede to review it and post it to compliment this short post :)  Later  (and play football)
