      It's Leap Day! I am a bit sad that this weekend has come to an end. Yesterday, we went to the  urlLink Virginia Marine Science Museum  ...and had a great time. Sabrina spent the night at her friend's house, there were a bunch of kids there, it was like they had a party (thanks Jeff!).   I went out last night to the Beir Garden in Portsmouth. I even tried two new beers! What's more amazing is that I liked them.   Today, we went to the zoo, here are some pics.   urlLink     urlLink

       urlLink    This is a journal of sorts, showing what I did, where I went, etc. It has been created thanks to a suggestion from Lindsay. We shall see how it goes. And what did I do today? Well, I am deeply addicted to my current book of choice,  urlLink The DaVinci Code   by Dan Brown. So I read that for the first part of the day. Wow! What a great book! Sabrina and I made gingerbread cookies tonight. Aren't they cute?

      This is the last day of Spring Break. It was nice... I put in time at  urlLink TDP  and it was a pleasure to be there all week.  Sabrina spent time with her friends. She stayed with her best friend across the street and today she played with Jacob. She had a great time. We have a project on Sea Turtles to do tomorrow, it should be fun.   As for me, I went out for dinner on Friday to be followed with karaoke with Kathy. Here is a pic of her singing; I was busted trying to sneak the picture and you can see her reaction. She would hate to know that I put that pic on the web, so I have included another one of her to be fair- from The Tap House later that night.   urlLink    urlLink    This pic is just too funny, that's drunk Kerri and Eric :-) Lastly, you can see Sabrina sleeping peacefully..that is right now. Aww...   urlLink    urlLink

      Another week has passed. There are tornadoes outside at the moment though I have yet to see them. But my TV viewing is interrupted with weather reports.   This weekend proved itself to be interesting, to say the least.  urlLink Sully's   was fun on Friday night and I was able to talk to Kate on Saturday. Hooray.  Today was a pretty lazy day, we spent the day at Kerri's and all the kids were able to play. Here are pics of Jamela's son, Ben, and the sweet baby Kora.   urlLink    urlLink     Spring break is this week, so I am hapy to be able to relax a bit. It allows me to put in a bunch of time at  urlLink The Dwelling Place . 'The Practice' is over so it's time to grade papers. Caio.

       urlLink    It's Friday! They cut the water off this morning so I have to wait to shower therefore I just had to take dumb pictures. The weather is absolutely gorgeous. However, this is the last day of April, then May comes, then we get the hot and humid summer. Can't it just stay like it is now? BTW- This is the view from the front of my apartment building.   UPDATE: The water was turned back on so now I am clean. I washed my hair with Herbal Essences and it did NOT make me do funny things in the shower.

       urlLink    The Hello Kitty birthday party was a hit! Sabrina had such a wonderful time. We drove to  urlLink Chincoteague  in the morning. The drive went well; the four of us (Sabrina and her friend Miranda and Lindsay and myself)were excited.   The party started at one at the restaurant.  We did cake, and presents, and all that fun. After that, we visited Poppop and more Hello Kitty presents were received. Man, Sabrina got a lot of Hello Kitty stuff! Along with a RC Barbie car, a Harmony Care Bear and clothes and books galore (that was me).   After the party, the kids were able to pet several ponies (it is Chincoteague, you know) which excited Miranda (it was her first trip to the island). We had a fabulous dinner of all-you-can-eat crab legs and such before being on our way back home to Norfolk. Miranda was passed out the whole drive home, but Sabrina refused to give in. Once we were back, I dropped everyone off and put the birthday girl to bed. Then, I watched  urlLink Bowling for Columbine  with Lindsay and Jason....   [see all pics  urlLink here .]

       urlLink    urlLink     We did go to the beach on Sunday! Even days later, the weather is still gorgeous. We are counting down to the big day - Saturday is Sabrina's birthday.   But even more exciting....today was report card day! And who is the smartest little girl in the world? You guessed it. Sabrina got all As for the second time in a row.

       urlLink    La la la...The SOC presentations are very interesting, a bit graphic at times, but interesting nonetheless. There are a bunch of pics around from our weekend. Friday there was dinner at Sully's, then Gabe, Lindsay and I went out for drinks and ~fun~.  urlLink    Saturday was consumed with frisbee golf, you can see how much fun Sabrina had. We are off to the beach now, this weather is beautiful!    urlLink     urlLink

      Well, another Sunday, another weekend passed.   Friday night we went out in celebration of Gabe's birthday. The night started with dinner at Jack Quinns, followed by pool at Red Dog, and more drinks at Sully's  . I forgot the camera, of course, so here are two pics taken with Lindsay's cell phone. It was a mucho fun night...  urlLink    urlLink    On Saturday, my parents came for a visit. Mom is going to Aruba, but she hates flying. She wanted to visit before the plane crashes... Silly Mom, we will see them next at Sabrina's birthday party at the restaurant, happy and healthy.   urlLink    urlLink

      What a wonderful holiday weekend. I don't know when I have enjoyed Memorial Day so much. I had set out to do absolutely nothing and I succeeded. Well, nothing productive anyway. Sabrina and I have spent our weekend with Jason, Lindsay, and Gabe. The party began, of course, with our 'Friday at Five.' That night Sabrina stayed with Miranda and the four of us had dinner and pool in a new setting. Saturday night we had a slumber party at Jason and Lindsay's. The cat and the flashlight is funny stuff. Sabrina enjoyed staying. I am not too sure Jason, did, however. :-)   We never made it to the beach this weekend since the weather was not conducive to doing so. We did, instead, drink a lot of beer and watch a bunch of movies. The cook-out is left, and then it is back to work and school tomorrow. Boo.   urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink

      So I spent two hours in the back of a police car last night. No no, I wasn't in trouble. There was a fight...Kerri had to pick me up from Granby Street at 3 in the morning. Insane. But I met a very nice officer named Warren (last name). We made kinda-sorta plans for him to speak to my Intro to Crim class in the fall. I got his number.   Before all that trouble, though, the  urlLink concert  was alright. They told us (in VA) that we were way better than Pittsburgh.    urlLink    this is a picture of the painting that is in my office at work.  it was a donation from a long time ago, but the boss didn't want it in the shelter because it is not blue.  i, of course, loved it since it has my favorite colors.  it has been sitting in my office for months, but has yet to be hung.

      Thursday night turned out to be a bust. No Friends. No ER. What else to do? Well, I took pictures (see below). I was able to get quite a burn on my back Friday at the beach (lucky me!). Did that stop me from going to the beach Saturday? Of course not. I did not, however, beach it today. We suffered in the heat at home. Sabrina and I watched movies. She liked  urlLink Speed , but I am not sure about  urlLink John Q .    urlLink    this is lindsay's kitty.  i took this pic yesterday and changed it to black and white cause his eyes were glowing.

       urlLink     Mandy was here! It was great to hang with her. Poor thing, though, she was sunburned by the time she got here (boo hoo, she got fried driving seven hours in a little red Mercedes convertible!) Yeah, she has a sweet ride. It was fun to play games in the middle of the afternoon (although Mandy did get beat down all week, hee hee). I felt a little like I was on vacation, too.  Friday was Kerri's birthday - the big 29!  It was the weekend of the cell phone. Ha Ha. Lindsay left hers on Friday, I left mine on Saturday, and Jason left his last night. We are all getting used to having personal secretaries.  Sabrina and I just got back from the beach, I think it is about to storm. One more thing...Lindsay and I put together arrangements for a trip to Canada - anyone wanna babysit for four days?

      What has been going on? Last week was a busy one. School is over! Thursday, there was the  urlLink Friends  finale. A big fat happy ending. Awww... Friday we went to  urlLink Town Point Park  to hear Maroon Five. It was brief, really. Sabrina stayed with Kerri and I went out. These pics are from Friday. James is funny. He's a future Supreme Court Justice (hee hee)...what else? Sunday we went to the beach...It was Mother's Day. Sabrina was SO good. She also wrote me a wonderful letter (you can read it  urlLink here ). I went to Super K to buy a frame last night...it was a terrible, miserable experience. No more K-Mart for me. I finally watched  urlLink Sweet Home Alabama   last night (ty ljp) since everyone has told me how good it was. Funny stuff. Went to the dentist this morning. All went well. Look out - Mandy is coming from PA tomorrow. Hopefully there will be excitment in the future (I cannot see how there will not be!).    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink

      it is amazing how much hotter it is on this side of the bay than on the eastern shore. once you get off that bridge, it's over... sabrina and i came back from chincoteague this morning. we went yesterday to enjoy some family time and to go out on the boat. i was directed not to stress the first part of the day, so i'll make it brief: as you can see, we went out on the boat with howard and robert. fishing commenced, but oh no! the boat broke down and my grandmother and her husband towed us back to the dock. boat trip over.  urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    but- we had the best dinner at the restaurant.  i learned a few things: i love the new crab pretzel, i cannot eat snow crab legs forever, and some waitresses really suck. BTW- you have to try the crab pretzel at  urlLink Steamers  , it's the best.   urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    later i took pics of howard's cats:   urlLink     urlLink    i saw this on my odometer today as i was driving across the causeway, thought it was pretty neat.  kinda like catching 11:11 on the clock.  urlLink    we came back so soon this morning because sabrina had a dentist appointment. but- her insurance has been cancelled. someone is going to hear it tomorrow. today, i am going to hook up my new printer dock and recharge my camera batteries. and clean up the house. and all the other stuff i have been putting off.

       urlLink    it is the first day of summer. it is the day after my birthday. it is another beautiful day.   some things to report: sabrina lost the front tooth that has been loose for so long on wednesday. thursday was the last day of school and she brought home another report card full of As.   i had a great weekend.   urlLink    urlLink     UPDATE: I just realized that I am an idiot. I just had a birthday where I could have asked for something that I have been wanting. I could have asked for  urlLink this book  that I have been dying to read. SO, if anyone out there wanted to get me something and didn't, here's an idea for you (wherever books are sold).

      With my birthday a week from today, an old college roomate wanted to get together to celebrate. I got 'directions to the country' and we went for a visit. Misti and Jason were not only kind enough to let us stay, but Misti greeted me at the door with a Bud Light. The drive there always makes me think of Bevan. (I recall driving to the funeral and seeing Scott on the tractor in Waverly. Even worse is the drive to Northern Virginia). But it was an awesome drive. I was listening to tunes from the days when we used to hang out and it was a gorgeous day.   We had a great time in  urlLink Disputanta . We reminisced and looked at pictures from the college days. Sabrina was happy to get to jump on the trampoline and play with the (five) dogs. I met some interesting characters. The cast included the funny guy (with a great story), the birthday girl, the atypical married guy, and the fireman. I ate lots of watermelon jello, jammed out to Tom Petty, drank a swig or two of Wild Turkey, danced in a bar that did not know how to make a Red-Headed Slut, received my first birthday present (Misti, I forgot it- oh no!) and saw more stars in the sky than I could ever see in Norfolk.   It was great. She should expect us again. :-)   A great trip would not be complete (it seems) without mention of the law. Yes, I got a 'summons for a speeding violation' (that's what he said) on the way home.   urlLink

      Things are good with us. Today is Field Day at Sabrina's school so I am sure she will come home this afternoon full of stories and excitement. The school year is almost over!   So, I updated last Wednesday...what is new since then? Um...uh...not a whole lot. Did the usual Friday thing, then Saturday reared it's head (I was babysitting that night and watched  urlLink Big Fish ). Sunday was relaxing, Monday was a long day - I was on hold all day with the MD and VA Departments of Child Support Enforcement. Yesterday I found out that Shadow (the cat who was sick) has made an astonishing recovery and is pretty much back to normal. Hooray.   Sabrina and I have resumed our tradition from last summer of walking around the neighborhood in the evenings. We walked for two hours last night. Such a good girl. Tomorrow is Howard's birthday. Happy Birthday Howie (he'd kill me for that one if he knew).   urlLink    this is a pic that howard took at sabrina's birthday (4-24-04).  i turned into a cartoon!  left to right, that is lindsay, me, and my dad.

       urlLink    I swear I couldn't survive without little notes and to-do lists. Today had it's ups and downs. Sabrina had a good day at school, there is obviously no homework this week. I had a productive day at work, finished this ESG package I have been working on, that's it in the pic. This picture was taken by accident, but it seemed to fit well with the day (again, with the notes and lists you can see). Also in the pic, you can see my 'perfect man' that Liz gave me for Christmas. This man sits on my desk everyday and when I want him to, he says things like, 'Let's just cuddle' 'Can't your mother stay for another week' and 'Honey, you take the remote, I don't want to watch the game.' Ha ha!    I did say the day had it's downs, too. I found out today, that Shadow, a family cat that I gew up with (and who BTW is about 17 years old) has AIDS and is very sick. Can you believe it? A cat. Poor Shadow-man.

(hooray, new friends!).    urlLink    this pic was taken thursday night, that's sage.  btw- i left a nasty voicemail message friday night.  my apologies to fred (i know you'll read this).

      The depth of the conversation played through their minds.  His actions showed his sincerity.  The look in her eyes told him exactly what she wanted.  "Now," he thought to himself.  Now is the time to tell her he loved her.

      Last night the funniest thing happened.  I came home from work and heard a faint meowing from the backyard.  I rushed to the edge of the woods, worried that it might be the cat.  Sure enough.  He was stuck in a tree.  He gave me this look that said it all:  "What the hell am I doing stuck in a tree?  I am a cat!  This is what we do!"  He appeared to be embarrassed.  The best part of this story: Perhaps it was sheer coincidence, but there was a family of mice below.  Was my cat really frightened so badly by mice to spend the entire evening in a tree?  Maybe...Of course, I helped him down.   (note:  this has happened to me, minus the mice)

      1) ...John F. Kennedy was shot? (11/22/1963)  Well, my mom was only four...  2) ...Mt. St. Helen's blew? (5/18/1980)  I was two, I have no idea...  3) ...the Challenger exploded? (1/28/1986)  I remember this one!  I was in elementary school (not sure which grade but the date suggests second grade).  I was seven years old at the time.  I do remember it and I know it made an impact.  We all talked about.    4)...the 7.1 earthquake hit San Francisco? (10/07/1989)  I was eleven for this one.  I remember seeing it on the news.  5)...the Berlin Wall Fell? (11/07/1989)  Again eleven.  I don't really have a memory of when this happened, but it is in there somewhere...  6) ... the Gulf War began? (01/16/1991)  No clue.  7) ... OJ Simpson was chased in his White Bronco? (06/17/1994)  Ah, something I do recall.  I watched it on the news at my uncle's house. I can still see that footage in my mind...  8) ... the Afred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was bombed? (04/19/1995)  I remember there was talk about foreign terrorists.  That sure wasn't right now was it.  9)...Princess Di was killed? (08/31/1997)  It was a Friday (or maybe Saturday night) and I had just gotten back to my apartment.  My second year of college.  Bevan and I came back from a party, it was late and night, and turned on the tv and it was everywhere.  I (sadly) remember thinking that it wasn't a big deal to me.  Well, it sucked that she was killed, but I was never interested in the British Royal Family.  10) ... Bush was first announced president? (11/07/2000)  I was in the computer lab working, my first year of grad school.  I called my mom and told her I feared for my life.    11) ... terrorists destroyed the WTC? (09/11/2001)  I woke up that morning to find my answering machine light blinking.  I did not turn on the tv or anything for a while.  My mom had been calling to see if I was alright. She thought they may attack Norfolk (navy).  I did turn on the tube just in time to see the second tower fall.  I called my friend Liz (after mom) and we watched it together for a while.  When I finally made it to work (at the computer lab) I spent the day in the Geography department office (they had a tv) wondering what was going to happen next.  There were men with guns walking up and down the streets here (again, navy).  Note:  That first Letterman when Dan Rather cried is something that I will never forget either.   12) ... Columbia disintegrated during re-entry over Texas? (02/01/2003)  I saw that on the news, too.  I was sitting right here in this very chair.

      It was the day after. Everyone always anticipates the big day. But what the hell do you do on the day after? The time spent preparing... now it's over.  Done.  Finished. Everything is different now, it's a whole new world on the day after.

      Sometimes we think that we cannot measure up.  But measure up to who?  Let's say it is  Joan .  We all have to be like Joan.  As thin as Joan.  As pretty as Joan.  As smart as Joan.  How does Joan feel that the world is trying to measure up to her standards?  I am Joan.  Go ahead and try.

      "Our high crime rates persist in the face of this toughening of sentencing and thus suggests that crime persists even though we have a harsh criminal justice system, leading one criminologist to characterize the get-tough approach to crime as a conservative social experiment that has been tested and shown to fail."

      Great.  I love it when I wake up in the morning only to find the remnants of another failed dinner.  Eggs- I don't even like eggs.  Flour- is it the same if I use Bisquick?  It is a good thing no one eats.

      Take your favorite artist then answer the questions using only song titles from that artist.   1. Are you male or female?:  IT'S ALL UNDERSTOOD 2. Describe yourself:  MEDIOCRE BAD GUYS 3. How do some people feel about you?:  MIDDLE MAN 4. How do you feel about yourself?:  FORTUNATE FOOL 5. Describe your girlfriend/boyfriend/interest:  DREAMS BE DREAMS 6. Where would you rather be?:  TRAFFIC IN THE SKY 7. What do you like?:   BUBBLETOES 8. Describe you in the future:  INAUDIBLE MELODIES 9. Describe your current mood:  LOSING HOPE 10. Share a few words of wisdom:  DRINK THE WATER, THE HORIZON HAS BEEN DEFEATED  So it was kinda dumb, but I wanted to see if I could make the titles work.  I wanted to pick Bryan Adams simply because he had so many albums and songs it would be easier.  But I didn't take the easy road this time, maybe it's a SYMBOL IN MY DRIVEWAY (had to sneak one more in).

      1. When was the last time you ate or drank something straight out of the container it came in, instead of using a dish or cup?  a few weeks ago i drank pepsi from the two liter. it was my first time.   2. When you are home alone, do you always close the door when you go to the bathroom?  nope. even if i did,  urlLink the cat  opens it and comes in anyway.   3. At your place of employment, how long can you get away without doing any work before someone will notice?  i'm not sure, but it would probably be a while.   4. Given your current health status, what do you think will be your cause of death? i'd starve to death.   5. Read any good books lately?  have i ever!   6. What are your strengths?  i'm kinda smart and i give with all my heart.  7. What are your weaknesses?  i'm fickle at times.  and i give with all my heart.  8. Who is a person you have lost touch with, to whom you wish you could reconnect? hmm... i know that there is someone...   9. What is your natural environment?  the beach, of course.   10. Which most influences your ability to get the things you want, resources or motivation? motivation. there's not usually any resources handy.   EXTRA CREDIT: If an intruder broke into your home while you were sleeping, what and where is the nearest weapon you can get your hands on?  i just took a quick glance around and saw not much of anything. the cell phone is nearby but i'm not sure i would be quick enough dialing for help considering the size of my apartment.
