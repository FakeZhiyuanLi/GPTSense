       urlLink    Meet my phobia. In spite of the fact that I am absolutely terrified of clouds, I also find them absolutely beautiful. This is portrait painted in the sky, by God, when we arrived at Pagudpud almost 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Reunion at home. Tita Geny laughing her head off. I think they were talking how everyone first met their spouses. I normally stay with the "grown ups" for conversations like these. Great book ideas *rubs hands*&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Faux Hong Kong. This is the tippity top of Tagaytay HIghlands. The building at the back is a steak house on the second floor (imagine eating steak with an awesome view!), and a cable leading to the golf course to the bottom of the Club. Notice the fog. Fog means that my taking this shot is asking for too much. For all I care, this shot costs a thousand bucks! *makes not to self*&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Meet my phobia 2. On the same day that I took this, a bird crached into the window and managed to reorient its flight after a 2 second drop. I on the other hand, stripped myself of cloud fear to take this shot. Congratulate me :)&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The family eats The Aristocrat in Malate, after 30 minutes of walking back and forth, and after causing an awkward standing presence in the restaurant. Rod is answering the kiddie place mat on whimsical fun, and he faces Tito Nick. Julia, is slowly getting tired as the night progresses while Danielle, Tita Gina and Jenny talk about something. Not seen in the picture are Tito Elmer and Pam.&nbsp; urlLink
