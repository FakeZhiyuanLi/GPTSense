       A story is told about a soldier who was finally coming home from the war. He called his parents from San Francisco. "Mom and Dad, I'm coming home, but I've a favor to ask. I have a friend I'd like to bring home with me." "Sure," they replied, "we'd love to meet him." "There's something you should know the son continued, "he was hurt pretty badly in the fighting. He stepped on a land mind and lost an arm and a leg. He has nowhere else to go, and I want him to come live with us."&nbsp;"I'm sorry to hear that, son. Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live."&nbsp;"No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us."&nbsp;"Son," said the father, "you don't know what you're asking. Someone with such a handicap would be a terrible burden on us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this interfere with our lives. I&nbsp;think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way&nbsp;to live on his own."&nbsp;At that point, the son hung up the phone. The parents heard nothing more from him. A few days later, however, they&nbsp;received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling from a building they were told. The&nbsp;police believed it was suicide. The grief-stricken parents flew to San Francisco and were taken to the city morgue to identify the body of their son. They recognized him, but to their horror they also discovered something they didn't know, their son had only one arm and one leg. The parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun to have around, but we don't like people who inconvenience us or make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.Thankfully, there's someone who won't treat us that way. Someone who loves us with anunconditional love that welcomes us into the forever family, regardless of how messed up we are.Tonight, before you tuck yourself in for the night, say a little prayer that God will give you the strength you needto accept people as theyare, and to help us all be more understanding of those who are different&nbsp;from us!!!There's a miracle called Friendship That dwells in the heart. You don'tknow how it happensOr when it gets started But you know the special liftIt always brings And you realize that Friendship Is God's most precious&nbsp;gift!Friends are a very rare jewel, indeed.They make you smile and encourage you to succeed They lend an ear, they share a word of praise, and they always want to open their hearts to us.

       So this is another of my three blogs haha, pretty strange huh? oh well :) So I was thinking, I heard on the radio that depression is something actually physically wrong in your brain, I'm not sure I believe that lol but I do believe that it is all in yor head, you have the choice to be depressed, I don't think you will be depressed if you don't want to be. I could be wrong and probably am for that matter lol. Well, I hate how sometimes I can be such a strong christian and then turn around and be such a hypocrite(sp?), sometimes my brother will play these songs that I know I shouldn't listen to(and him too) and i'll say something along the lines of "I don't want to listen to that because I don't to immerse myself in secular music" and then later on or maybe another day i'll listen to songs that are still secular(maybe not as much swearing), and it makes me mad how weak I am. &nbsp; -William-
