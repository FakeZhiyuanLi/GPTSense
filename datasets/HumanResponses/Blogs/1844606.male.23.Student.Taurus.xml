      You ever check out other people's journals and see something like:  "Men are complete dogs" or "Its great that women are so f**** understanding."  How passive aggressive is that move? If you got something to say say it.  With that said, I'm out.    PS Any chance that "analysis" has the word "anal" up front on purpose?  Just wondering

      The title is a bit ambiguious if you don't live/go to U of I, but hopefully my fantastic writing and description will give you all the info you need to know. Right.  So, I live in apartment, and for the most part I love it.  The massive problem last year was the frat across the way, literally 10 ft. from my bedroom window, loved to play basketball.  Or as I came to call it "Bounce bounce F***!" because every other 10 seconds I would hear two dribbles of a basketball, a clang of the rim and some sort of profanity.    I was increadibly overjoyed to find out the frat house is being torn down.  (PS If you have issues with me calling a "fraternity" a "frat" do the world a favor and depledge from your house by finding out if you're allergic to bullets.)  But, I found out that the frat lifestyle moved below me.    I wasn't awake for this conversation, but I'll relay the story my roomate told me.    Late one Sunday night, my roomate was up late playing videogames in his room when he heard yelling from outside his window.  He sat up in bed, pulled back his curtains and could just barely make out a group of guys calling each other assorted slang terms for gay people.  He decided to go downstairs to get a better view of the proceedings and ran into our rather favorable neighbors downstairs.  After introducing themselves, meathead 1 and 2 began the conversation:  MH1: Hey, if you guys ever have a problem with our music, could you just call us instead of calling the cops.  We had a lot of problems last year with people calling the cops on us. Roommate: Ok MH1:  This is (introduces MH2).  What bars do you go to around here? R:  Murphy's mostly. MH1:  Cool.  If you ever want the hook up, I work at CO's and this guys a manager at Kam's R:  Right, I'll see you guys later  For the record, Kam's is the bar of choice for dudes that like to use ruffies as their pick up line and women who will do anything to be around jocks.  Kam's also has been shut down on various occations for allowing 13 year olds into the bar, and most recently has been closed for encouraging drinking games by rewarding those that drink the most with more free shots.  Classy joint let me tell you.  I made a pact with my roomate at the beginning of Freshman year never to set foot into that place and I'm proud to say neither of us has ever been.  Cut to Thur. night   In between the VMA's and Cubs blowing another lead in St. Louis, at about 9PM Meathead 1 and 2 decided that we wanted to feel their music.  Not just hear, feel.  Our floor began to reverberate and eventhough our TV was at about 3/4 as loud as it could go, we still couldn't hear the TV, less than five feet from our ears.  I decided to give them a half hour of Techno blasting until the cops were called and 3 min. before the self imposed deadline, the thumping mercfully stopped.  I don't want to get into a war of calling the cops on each other with these two because once my roomate gets his half stack working, he'll be loud too, but jesus, techno sucks.  And I can handle loud music, but when you are shaking the entire floor of someone else, its too loud.  Here's another thought to chew on, if you've had problems with the vol. of your music before, take a clue and turn it down.  We'll see how this plays out.

      Right, so the first week of classes are done with.  Highlights included:  -After discussing all the advances gay right have made in the past few months, my Sex Teacher (sorry Community Health Professor) asked, "What happened recently in Canada?" some jackass yelled out "SARS!" It drew a laugh, but the sad thing is, I don't know if the kid was seriously answering the question.  -I'm taking a Post Modern 300 level English class (pomo) if you will and my Professor was a trucker.  I'm not talking delivering auto parts NAPA style, I'm talking coast to coast action.  Apparently, he stummbled onto the profession after becoming disenchanted with acadamia and subsequently came running back to teaching after less than a year on the road.  Dude is awesome.  He made a cd for the class containing all supplimental reading for the year and saved everyone about $30, while also being increadibly liberal with copyright laws. Double Bonus!!  After debating himself aloud for a few min. the Professor professed a desire to hold informal office hours at Murphy's ( a local bar) despite possible legal/ethical problems posed by holding meetings with students in a bar.  At the beginning of class, he told us we were free to bring any substances that would help keep us alert and then after seeing several sly smilles creep across our collective faces he tagged on the disclaimer, "That are legal."  An audible sigh of disapointment reverberated throughout the room.  Not like I do drugs or anything but I heard the chorus to "Feel Good Hit of The Summer" roll around in my head. C-c-c-c-c-cocaine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want all the lyrics for "Feel Good Hit of the Summer" go here:  www.thefade.net/lyrics/feelgood The Professor ended the class saying he's more than willing to share trucker stories with us and enticed us with a little preview.  On one of his first days out training, the instructor for the Professor informed him that he sold illegal handguns out of his truck at truck stops.  Kind of makes you want to be a trucker don't it??  My last class on Thur. could have been dreadful, but turned out ok.  Reading about Restoration Period England isn't exactly high on my list of things to do, but graduating is, so I'm in the class.  At first I thought the Professor was going to be a total hipster cause he was rocking the glasses and black bowling shirt.  However, he's a very regular fellow, except for the fact he lived in San Francsisco and moved to these here cornfields. Newsflash buddy, it goes the other way around.

      Realize, dear readers, that a good deal of my stories will come from the bathroom stalls of various locals in central Illinois.  Not cause I'm a janitor or anything, but well nevermind.  On my second day of classes, I walked into another set of stalls in the English building and found another random post about Ms. So and So's sexual exploits.  All I'm going to say is that according to the wall, she enjoys man juice.  I'm beginning to think someone has a serious vendetta or crush on this chick, either way I really got to figure out where this chick is and what she's been up to...jk

      Jesus, did Coldplay win enough VMA's this year?  It was a running joke throughout the procession.  It only angered me when they beat out Johnny Cash and Queens of the Stone Age.    Speaking of the Queens, someone at MTV announced that the band showed up and Nick Oliveri was decked out in a dress and smeared make-up.  Words can't describe how much I wanted to see an interview.  Instead, the heads of programming decided to show Sean Paul preforming some reggae-tinged trash and orignally I thought that he should pay royalties to Bob Marley for all those damn Jamacan flags the audience were waving around, but in the end decided that any connection to Bob Marley would be disgraceful.  Moral of the story, Sean Paul is my new favorite hate.  Things didn't get much better when the actual show started.  Oh wait, Brittney made out with Madonna.  It didn't seem contrived at all.  Millions of guys began grabbing their junk and running to the bathroom within moments of said kiss.    Chris Rock killed and it was worth it.  My two favorite lines from the proceeds were (and I'm paraphrasing) "The Olsen twins are here, and they had to seat R. Kelly up there (points to balcony)" (I don't think I'll ever get sick of R. Kelly jokes and/or golden shower jokes about R. Kelly) and "Good Charlotte, more like a mediocre Green Day."  How the truth hurts.    In the meantime, 50 Cent looked thuggish and was one of the better performers of the evening, not based on singing tallent, but for the fact he emerged from a Pimp Cup (in what could have been a truly Spinal Tap moment).  Althougth I don't think it was his intention, Mr. Cent pulled off the theme of "pimp" well by coming from said cup, and having real pimps on stage.  Bravo.   Better yet, Mr. Cent (how awesome is that name?) had Snoop on stage with his "spiritual advisor" Don Magic Juan.  For those of you who don't know, Don Magic Juan is one of the most famous Pimps of all time and used to live in Chicago's West Side, where he drove a teal Bentley.  Nothing like keeping a low profile.  But Snoop's best performance wasn't on stage, it came earlier in the evening when he WALKED WOMEN DOWN THE RED CARPET ON LEASHES LIKE DOGS!!!!!!!! (or bitches if you will).  I surprised N.O.W. hasn't had his head.  Then again, he's Snoop.    Overall, the most entertaining part was the red carpet because of the sheer ludicrisness of entrences made by rappers.  OutKast gets an honorable mention for showing up with a flatbed pickup adorned with a stripper pole and strippers.    Overall, I was disapointed, no Johnny Cash and you would think that a building that holds DMX and ODB would result in something scandalous, yet all that occured was a plug for DMx's new album "Grand Champ" coming out Sept. 16.  So important that I marked it in my I Book.  As much as I wanted to see Johnny Cash lay waste to all others, I held hope that Metallica could do something cool.  And they still could, it just didn't happen at the show.  After hyping the fact that "they're gonna do something special at the end" all we got was a shitty lounge-actesque run through the riffs of "are you gonna go my way?," "smells like teen spirit," "beat it," and "seven nation army."  Didn't even get to see the Trujillo dance.  For the record, Audioslave did a cover of "seven nation army" at Lolla.  Anywho, I still held hope, but all Metallica did was "Frantic," the best song off the new album, but that's like getting a cold instead of the clap...that analogy sounded better in my head.  Point is, new stuff doesn't rock like "Creeping Death."  I suppose my hopes were raised because while watching the VMA's last year, when I remarked to my roomie that the only way the show could get better was if Gn'R played.  They did, and played "Paradise City."  Metallica should have taken notes.  My roomate and I speculated that this year could have been better only if Black Sabbath or Rush showed up.  Neither did, hence the disapointment.  Think that's about it. Wait.  Beyonce drank a Pepsi in the middle of her set, ushering an entirely new low in product placement and advertisment.   And Good Charlotte won a Viewer's Choice, once again proving pre-teen girls know how to effectively dial a phone number and lack any taste in music whatso ever.

      You have a really good drummer.  Use him.  Blips and bleeps don't work.  For referrences, look to the Pumpkins cerca "Adore" VS. Pumpkins cerca "Siamese Dream."  Drum machines named Max don't stand up.  Real drummers sound better.  I'll get off my soapbox.  Oh by the way, the show at Alpine Valley was phenominal.  Don't believe me, take a look at this:  http://www.ateaseweb.com/live/2003/20030823.php  As good as it was, it doesn't compare to this show however:  http://www.ateaseweb.com/live/2001/20010801.php  Who knew a show that successful would pave the way for Shania Twain to play Chicago?  According to Greg Kot, it did.  Shameful.

      As long as I'm bitching about production sounds, what the hell was Lars (sars) Ulrich using for drums during St. Anger?  Pots and pans?  Garbage Cans?  I blame Bob Rock.  I'd like to think the band would be smart enough, or at least take the time to at least make the drums sound half way decient.  Remember the drum sound on the Black Album?  That's what I'm talking about.

      In the first of what's sure to be many posts about the current state of music, let my opening salvo be fired against the strokes.  In the interest of disclosure, I do in fact own their first cd and did enjoy it for some time, until radio played the hell out of it.  Anyways, my point.  I read this:  www.vh1.com/news/articles/1477670/20030826/index.jhtml?headlines=true  And this quote catches my eye.  "I don't want my record to sound like a demo," Strokes singer Julian Casablancas says. "I mean, I like the demo, I like the vibe and all, but it's [been] done."   Silly me, I thought the first album was a demo, cause it sure as hell didn't sound produced.

      Today, as I was chilling in one of the bathroom stalls, I perused the walls and saw this, "So and so f**** like WILDFIRE."  Obviously, the girl isn't named so and so, but as I don't know whether liable holds true in cyberspace, I decided against her actual name.  How weird is that?  I know someone who has made it to the immortal space of bathroom graffiti.  Though I'm sure she wouldn't be so happy if she knew.

           Whooooooo hoooo last year (knock on wood) and ever since watching Billy Madison, I think I sing that little song to myself on this day.  Not much happened, but I guess that's to be expected.  Both classes let out well before their alloted time and I rushed back to the sweltering inferno that is my apt. to eat lunch and catch a nap.  However, the ever present scream of chainsaws kept me from dozing so I wound up sweating up my bed nicely.          Psych class (something about personality) was chockful of hot women, and I'm guessing they're there to figure out what's wrong with them.  And I'm there to stare, I mean learn.  No Final in that class and its taught by committee.  We'll see how that turns out.        Rhet was the one class I was looking forward too the most during the summer, partly because it involves, well, writing, but also because I had a feeling that I would know the most people there.  And I was right.  Oh, was I right.  Buddy Holly Glasses Girl is in the class.  Cept she wasn't wearing glasses, but I wasn't fooled.  After saying I didn't have much to say about the summer, I rattled off a list of books read and wowed her with tales of Johnny Cash's meth filled hijinks in the 60s.  Meth filled Hijnks, make sure to catch them when they come through town.  (If you are currently searching ticketmaster or in any other way trying to research this band, get a life hipster).    So right, Buddy Holly bast from the past.  Speaking of past rememberences, Rhet class was like a reunion of sorts of various kids from Honors classes past.  To further the weirdness of the situation, my current Rhet class is in the same room as the one from last semester and the kids that are/were in both classes SAT IN THE SAME SEATS!!!  Man, talk about being trained and programmed.  Freaky.

      This whole blogging thing is rather new to me, and seeing how I don't have much background (read:none) in computer programming, things will probably look pretty crude on this page for ahwile.  So I'll put substance over style and see how it goes.  Oh yes, and I don't plan on being offensive, but if it happens, this is your warning now.

      Do I like stress?  That would be a resounding no.  Not like I ever enjoyed it, but now I feel it something fierce, right below my belly button, right side.  All I have left to do before Wed. is write the best thing I've ever come up with.  Because nothing I do will ever satisfy those annoying pricks in my writing class.  I'm contemplating taking up the fake format of an editorial page and write it "Dude who sits in my rhet class, why you suck" and make it a weekly revolving feature.  Totally passive aggressive, but isn't that what the Internet was built for? (that and porn?).  So my subversive thought for the day is this, if no one is going to like my writing in class, I'm gonna freak them the fuck out.  My idea:  The fab 4....Mousallini, Stalin, Hirohito (I know I'm horribly spelling these names wrong) and Hitler as John Lennon.  First sentence...  Dateline Krakow, Sept. 1, 1939  Fab Four release hit single "Blitzkrieg," takes Poland by storm.   Eva Braun as Yoko Ono.  If you thought people hated Yoko before, just wait.  Don't know what the point of the story is so far.  It would be offensive, but the best thing would be if it had a subtle message so people who attack the idea on princple alone look like idiots because they missed the subtlety.  So tired, wish I could curl up with a Beagle and watch the Bears.  Instead, I shall vent frustration into writing.  Or I wish I could get some hands on studying for Human Sexuality.  Oh well.

      The Cubs and Red Sex (damn I actually typed that...subliminal nothing) ahhem The Cubs and Red  Sox  are in the Playoffs for the first time in, well I wish I knew, but I'm sure the last time this happened was approximately when my dad was 5, or his dad was 5, one of the two.  How crazy is it to think of things in historical significance?  Last time the Cubs were in the World Series, it had been a few months after the last Atomic Bomb was dropped.  If I were able to control the outcome of the Playoffs, this is what would happen:  -Red Sox defeat Yankees, sending those overprices asses into two hundred years of mediocrity. -Cubs meet the Red Sox in World Series -Cubs win. -Michigan Ave. has a parade that rivals Boys Town...  I think if these events unfolded as I have laid out, I would have to stop watching baseball for the rest of my life cause it couldn't get any better.  Speaking of life, if the Cubs were to meet the Red Sox, I have a feeling a lot of old people in Chicago and Boston would die happy.  Kind of like when the Millenium rolled around, a lot of folks held out until the ball dropped, then they did.  I'm sure if I was 90 or 100 years old and my fav. team finally won the WS, I'd be able to go peacefully and happy.  On to lighter topics  I'mdoinstreamofconciousnessrightnowandifeellikejackkerouacbecauseiamnotusingspacesandi'musingthewordandasaperiodanditwouldbereallyhardtogetthisunlessyoureallyenjoyjackkerouacsoifyoulikejkihopeyoulikethisexperimentcauseicantkeepnottypingthespaces.  Exercise for your eyes yo.  I've got a psych test tomorrow.  I'm more worried about being able to sit through the test, than the test itself.  Rediculous isn't it?  I get infused on Fri.  I can't wait.  Besides herion addicts, I'm about as happy as you can be to get stuck with a needle.  Unless I got a tattoo.  I've been thinking about it.  Probably when I get real money, and a real job and....I'll find reasons not to do it. I've got the design picked out.  Spades man, spades.  Recently, I've been having an extra-ordianry amount of dreams about ex-gfs and crushes.  I'm pretty sure this is a byproduct of two things: thinking about them before I fall asleep and being lonely.  I'm  this  close to giving my pillow a name...Like Linda or something.  I don't think I can fall asleep anymore without having something to snuggle with.  I can't believe I'm writingthisrightnow.  Guess its cause I'm tired (or at least that's what I'll blame this shocking honesty on).  While I'm on an honesty kick...I'm gonna stop.  Actually I'll just pose a question.  Have you ever had, what I'll refer to as a "sex flashback."  Doesn't necessarily have to be sex, but somesort of intimate thing, where BAM out of the blue, you get a sudden rush of all sensations of that moment, taste, smell, texture the whole nine yards?  Happens at least once a month if not more.  As if my classes weren't boring enough, my senses decide to remind me of a better time, a better place and I'm stuck.  grrrr.  Time for bed.  More dreams to follow.  The one that caught my attention today was multifacited in the fact that I was combining many locals.    At one point I was in Highwood, motoring back from the Hoagie Hut on the chair I am currently sitting on, typing this garbage.  I was heading to Lake Bluff.  When I got there, I entered a friends house, a kid that goes to school here.  I haven't been to his house in about a solid decade.  I walked up his stairs into his room and found out that another friend/roommate was injured.  I came to my apartment, which was more like a loft and walked next door to find my real roommate's ex-gf hanging out with one of my ex-gf.  My ex was clothed, or at least I thought she was because as I went over to comfort her, (apparently she had broken up with her perpetually stoned boyfriend) I realized she was wearing a thong.  Someone else pointed this out and she ran out the door and switched into her yellow colored strawberry adorned pajama pants.  I looked into her face and it was so vivid I couldn't believe it was a dream. K, come to think of it, in regards to scenes involving sleeping, I do use one ex girlfriend fairly extensively as the template for conversations.  Cause its all I know.  And they say you should write what you know about.  So I guess my great novel on Alaskan Moose hunting will not be written this year.  Now its really time for bed, where I'll have a thousand good story ideas run through before I finally succumb to sleep and will be awoken by the froterism fan club downstairs deciding that if they can't be bumping bumpin to techno, they'd rather be banging doors so they can at least feel a beat.

      Following up on that post (which now that I think of it will appear before the previous post), I always try to stay away from writing about relationships because I don't want to be known as "that guy/ that girl" that uses his life straight up for "stories" that are supposed to be "fictional", but really wind up being a slick re-hash of previous events.    What I do to offset this problem is that I put a little bit of myself into every character, that way I don't identify fully with anyone in particular.  What I really want to do with this story is slam the shit out of all the kids in the class.  It could be so good.  Premise of the story is the narrator is a creative writing teacher and then I subtley dig at all the types of writing I hate.  Such as:  -using stories as a form of therapy.  There are people working hard for degrees in Psychology.  Go pay these people because I, as an Eng. and Rhet. Major, am not being compensated for listening to your trivial little problems about when your favorite pony died when you were a small child. -I'll admit I'm guilty of this one.  I have written, to my count, at least two full stories about relationships I've been in.  The difference/justification is this: I had not been seeing/interested in the person for a max. of 6 months.  This allows perspective, and also lets me write a  story  as apposed to a blow by blow account of he said she said, which let me tell you, can drag on and on.   -People who write about themselves and then  don't   change the name of the protagonist.  Seriously people, if you're going to make me spend time reading and critiquing something, at least make the effort to put a different frickin name down on the page.  My other problem with this inability to not name characters is that it completely ruins the whole "author is not narrator" idea that has been ingrained in my brain since I entered college.  It lessons the impact of the story and ultimately makes it come off as juvinial.  If that's what you want, keep it in your journal.  -Don't rant (this is my PoMo ironical point) -Don't write about art, or something related to aesthetic pleasure.  You come off sounding pretentious and if I wanted to look at a painting, I would.  I don't want to read about still lifes. -I'm guilty of this one hard core.  Don't referrence music just because it has sentimental value to you as the author.  It will not have the same impact on you as it does for the reader, thus the author looses control over what he/she is writing. -if you have a crush on someone in the class, tell them, don't write a subtle story about it Shakespeare. -Along the same lines, don't use the stories as a way to pick up women by acting emo.  (I'm kind of guilty of this).  Cause I really want to write my seminal piece "misogyny rules"  and then do a completely scathing piece on women and their inconsistances.  My second book would be "Male Assholes."  Think of it as a compainon piece. -Don't write shit, seems simple, but I'm sick of it -If you're gonna be super critical, you better be able to back it up, cause there ain't nothing worse than someone thinking they are God's greatest gift and then they constantly turn in subpar work.  Phew, I think my treatise is just about wrapped up.

      Yeah, creative writing, it can be fun, but right now, its a pain in the, ass.  Did I use enough commas inapropriately in the last sentence?  So this is it kids, this is the paragraph that I feel is so good, that I can't get past:   He woke up disappointed.  He woke up comma disappointed. He lay silently still under neon stars affixed and inadvertently dangling.  The stucco ceiling always reminded him of icing from a cake just this close to falling.  Tired hands helped remove the early morning fog as his gaze wandered around the room.  Red numbers in the distance confirmed he did not want to be awake this early.  As he flexed and stretched he noticed his jeans had slipped down past his waist and currently were bunched up in a ball around his ankles.  But his boxers were still on.  The voice of Lindsey’s voice echoed in his mind, “Just do it for me, you never know.”  As if he was going to spontaneously inseminate her in the middle of the night or he would wake up inside of her.  I think the thing this story has going for it so far is I some how managed to use the term "spontaneously inseminate" in a creative fashion.  Come to think of it, I don't know how that term could be used uncreatively

      I have a bone to pick with the people who posted the "Immigrant Song" on Kazaa.  And I put the title in quotation marks not because its the way you're offically supposed to do it, but rather, its cause every mindless idiot out there has posted either "Over the hills and far away" or "Black Dog" as the "Immigrant Song"  Oh, and for those of you like Larz Ulrich who think this is wrong, I own the CD, its just not with me right now.

      The phrase "Limp Bizkit'ed it up" came after a hard night of drinking, sometime this past May, when the infamous Bizkit decided that Metallica didn't know what they were doing when recording "Sanitarium" and decided that what the song really  really  needed, was a dj scratching solo.  With that in mind, my review of the Bizkit boys doing "Behind Blue Eyes" by the Who.  Well, the fucked it up in ways unimageninable.  They used Speak 'n' Spell this time.  The voice says "Discover" and then someone cleverly spells out "Limp Bizkit."  Originally, I thought that they were going to go all mash mash nu metal with the song, but never got to the more rocking section of the song.  Fred, you sheer lack of tallent, and ability to make me cringe at rock classics is second only to P. Diddy and the rape number he pulled on "Kashmir."  Good job.

      Man, I love the Family Guy... For those of you keeping score of my favorite cartoon characters at home Stewie is my new favorite cartoon character, thus subplanting (is that a word?) Mojo Jo Jo.  Any two year old character with an English accent hellbent on world domination is comedic gold.

      I realize I'm mixing musical tastes slightly, but I think I'm going to entitle all posts pertaining to Buddy Holly, "The continuing saga of BH"  I also understand that this might be boardering on creepy stuff, so I'll keep this realitvely short.  Its more of a question of the rhetorical nature, that is answered by me, thus making it not rhetorical...chew on that for awhile   As far as I know, I have no real fetishes about sexuality.  I know I dig chicks with curly hair, and for some reason, fell into a rut of about 2 years where all women I dug had the initals of LM.  How weird is that?  Anyways, Buddy Holly wears glasses.  Its how the name came about.  But sometimes she doesn't wear them.  And she doesn't look hot at all.  More ape-like. I'm a guy, I can't explain it any better.  Its like her cheekbones are too curved and longish in the wrong places.  The glasses give more symmatry to her face.  Has anyone else noticed a phenominon like this, where someone can be dead on sexy with one thing and look completely different (and not attractive) without it?  Not like I think about this chick much, I just can't help but looking at her in class.    We also play a game of "catch the other looking at the other"  Kind of cool I guess, potentially embarassing.  She's a tough cookie to crack.  I pretty much gave up on her last year.  But who knows.

      The past two nights, I had some severly disturbing dreams.    TV Narrator voice:  Previously in my Dreams   Setting:  I think I'm in college, but I'm actually wondering around LHS combined with Highland.  Outside the Auditorium entrence at LHS.  Hundreds of Blonde women with Microphones screaming to go inside.  I walk inside and find a bathroom. (how sad is it that even in my dreams, I act like real life).  As I sit down, the walls blow away and all the women are standing there laughing.  I continue to sit, because I apparently understand that this is a test of wills.  I look to the left and see some kid from my Rhet class (the one who DOESN'T LIKE THE BIG LEBOWSKI!!!!!!) and he stands up, drops trow and beings to manually stimulate himself.  In two swift strokes, he manages to pelt the women with his juices.  But it gets more bizzare  Magically I am transplanted to the gym at Highland and I see a kid from my floor Freshman year start to wrestle w/ some guy.  In order to prove his point, he also sheds his pants and in two quick motions covers the guy in his man juice.    Last night, I had a dream that a former flame urinated on her ex-boyfriend's face.  He then promptly got up and threw a Bowie knife at me.   Seriously, what the hell is going on in my head.

      I spent the best $6 of my life on a ticket to see Zoso. Yes, you guess it, they are a Led Zeppelin tribute band.  Not only do they sound dead on, everyone looks the part.  Very cool, and creepy if you think about it for too long.  Especially when you visit their website:  www.zosoontour.com  And find out in the pictures section that everyone has the name of a band member, as if they are the real people.  Guitarist Joe Blow is called Jimmy Page.  Interesting.    Anyways, during one of the songs I started to wonder what a perfect day would be like.  And this is what I came up with:  -Wake up late, refreshed but tired from a strenious night of coitus with a special lady  -Enjoy more coitus  -Skip class, stay in bed, listen to Led Zeppelin on vinyl, enjoy coitus til I feel like taking a nap.  -Have a good nap  -snuggle (this last entry was placed by the lady)  Here's hoping it happens sooner than later

      solid state technology.   And a hipster hangover.  Two wilco shows in two days, and I was going to see Ozma tonight but work/stomach issues kept me from seeing the Tetris song live.  Oh well.    Did I mention someone (possibly high on PCP) decided to test the strength of my door last Thursday morning?  Well they did.  And I tested my ability to move from deep sleep to adrenilne rush in less than a min.  My fingers also got a work out dialing 911.  Now my abilities to work the system and reading the fine print on a lease will be put to good use.  Here's hoping there's some justice for someone who wants to live in peace without looking around his apartment to see what he can use to defend himself.  Latenight goodnight

Capitalism and consumerism had babies at some point and its offspring set up shop tonight at the Union.    Basically this post is about my realization of selling myself to the highest bidder and hoping that I can enjoy my job at some point.  Oh yes I almost forgot.   Somebody from the Illini basketball team got a job at the DI.  I'm sure they took him based soley on his writing abilities...

      During incessant Cubs watching over the past week, I must have seen an ad for the second Rambo movie over 10 times, and finally my will broke and I rented the DVD because I couldn't wait til Sept. 18th to watch.   Critics might pointout a lack of dialouge, acting or common sense, but what gripped me was the fantastically stereotypical depiction of the Vietnamese as hookers.  But then I realized the actors weren't Vietnamese, they were mostly Chinese, and wore outfits that resembled something out of Imperialist British-Era occupation.  But, watching shit blow up is cool, cause seriously can you beat a scene entitled "Explosions" on the DVD?  Can't say they didn't warn you.

So now, every year, not only do I sit back and think about the monstrosities that occured in DC, Penn. and NYC, but I am also reminded that Grandpa isn't around anymore.    And I know that if he were here, he'd be watching the Cubs game with me.  But maybe he's still watching, just from a better seat.

      Just kidding bout that last post...  I was in my palacial apt. and wondered out of my room to find my feet gently flowing across thick snow white shag carpeting.  As I walked towards the windows, I realized my roommates closet for a room had now expanded into something comperable in size to a hotel suite.  Looking back to the living room, I noticed my roommate's tv was in the place of our tv.  When I returned to his room, the big tv had grown and was firmly fit into an entire wall.  I went back to my room and dug around in my closet, suprised to find jerseys from all the teams The Great One played on (and an Alou jersey).  In my dream I thought that Dave Sliozis had left all his stuff in my closet.  I then went to the bathroom to find all of our pop strewn about the floor under the sink, and at just about this time, my roommates mother appeared out of nowhere and started yelling at me.  Then my alarm went off.

      I've been thinking it over, and I can't think of a single genre of music I hate more than Techno.  Mindless, completely mindless.  Seriously is there anything remotely redeaming about it?  Its just beats, over and over and over.  And when you hear silence, you hope that it has finished. But its just a tease, cause those fat beats start to drop again.  Why am I ranting about this you ask?  Cause the people below me LOVE it, and feel the need to share it with everyone.  Especially at 2 or 3 in the morning, the most convienent time for everyone else.  So considerate.  After finally falling asleep I was again awoken to the sounds of the house next door being demoed.  Originally, I thought this would be really cool and only take a few days to do, but they've been working (or not working as it were) since the third week of August!  The work ethic in the South is just about as good as there tollerence for minorities.  I'm so tired.  I want restfull sleep.  And someone just came and knocked on my door telling me they're having a party tonight...No rest for the weary

      So I was a DJ at a radio station.  And was contemplating quiting this year.  But the decision has already been made I guess because they aren't telling me when there are meetings.  Apparently, I'm not on the schedule either.  Winners I tell you.

      You ever find yourself thinking about what was going on a year ago, literally?  It just so happens I had a flashback and remembered its someone's birthday.  She's 21.  Wish I was there to celebrate.  Its one of those deals where the friendship seemed more solid than it really was, and in typical slapnutz fashion, I misread it all, said things I shouldn't have said and sometime last March it got to the point where I realized it wasn't worth the time or effort to maintain it all.  But sometimes you wonder.  How things are going, what's new.  But the effort of asking overrides ego.  A year ago today I had been living in this apartment for about 2 and a half weeks.  I knew her birthday was coming up and being in the lowly position of "cute friend" was handcuffed by the possiblities of a gift.  Hours were spent in the most unmasculine of stores looking for the "perfect card."  After narrowing the choices to something non-mushy and somewhat sly, I returned home and showed my roommate the choices.  They were, in his words, decidedly weak.  Back to Hallmark I went and wound up getting something different.  But ah, what should the gift be?  I wrote a quick note, hyping my culinary abilities.  Quick isn't the best word, considering five drafts were written for a three line note.    Her birthday was upon us.  I went to a meeting after classes and called later on.  Sweat dripped from the point of my nose and hit the phone.  This time it wasn't nerves, but the heat.  I walked over to her place an hour later to drop off the card, and her "guy friend" was there.  Talking was kept at a premium.  I claimed work had to be done and made a quick exit.  I hadn't seen her in two weeks but it felt longer.  Talking on the phone was a mixed blessing of comfort combined with an ache of not seeing her.    A few days later on the phone, she talked about new jobs and new guys she was scopeing.  If I knew better, or took off my blinders, I would have seen it all.  But I didn't.  Jealousy, anxiety and a slight sense of desperation shook me.  Beer could not calm me and I found myself lying awake, having to write to get this off my chest.  The beginnings of a great letter never sent lay on the back page of a discarded notebook.  Its themes all too framiliar.  I knew I was in trouble because I now admitted I cared.  A few days later, I spoke those words that kill friendships between the sexes.  Things just haven't been the same.  She was the last great hope of the past year.  Here's to the next.

      Scene:  Attractive girl standing off to my left, looking at me.  Me, seated, wishing that I was still listening to "You think I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like a Millionaire" Is that the best title for a song this year and a half? (Yeah that's right I referenced it twice in less than 20 min.  Can you dig it??)  Q:  Can I sit here? A:  Sure Q:  Can I ask you a question? A:  Shoot Q:  I'm a reporter for the D I and I was wondering what you're doing for Dad's Day weekend? A:  Going home to see a concert Q:  Cool, which one?

      Apparently, Satan isn't allowed to play on national TV shirtless.  The tattoos probably scare people.  Earlier in the day I read, "You think I ain't worth a dollar, but I feel like A Millionaire" will be the 3rd US single off of Songs for the Deaf.  I couldn't agree more.  Give me torro Gimmie Some MORE!!!!!!!  Now the US will be inflicted/blessed with Satan screaming!!!!  For those of you who haven't caught on, I think Nick Oliveri has to be one of the scariest looking dudes around and when I first say him sing/scream on stage, he frightened me like...satan.  And the name stuck.   Queens were on Leno, and I was hoping Millionaire would be played, but they did "Go With the Flow."  Not exactly a let down, but was really hoping to see Nick eat the mike.

      In general, hipsters are pretty easy to spot.  If you need help, refer to the Hipster Handbook.  However, in the interest of simplicity, a friend of mine Scruff came up with an ingenious idea.  In times of trouble, Christians made half a sign of a fish, and if the other person didn't make the other half, they knew they were an enemy.  I'm thinking we need to have a similar way to find out hipsters.  Something along the lines of, "Being there was awesome."

      Man, would that ever be a great way to start a story.  The story is this, I'm sitting at my computer listening to Miles Davis and I hear a rustle from outside my door.  I ignore it at first.  But it comes back again.  I know my roomate isn't in, so I decide to investigate.  As I walk into his room, I find a squirrle face first into a bag of Tositos that the little bugger managed to rip open.  I wouldn't say I was scared of the li'l bastard, it was just a monetary recognition of, "That's not supposed to be in here."  He scampered away through the whole in my roomie's screen (presumably made by the squirrel) with a moderately squirrle-sized chip in mouth.  I closed the window and he ran away into the tree.  He came back less than a min. later, looking for more chips and shot me a dirty squirrle stare for closing the window (if such things as dirty squirrle stares exist)

      Hello readers.  A warning to start off tonight's journal.  I am intoxicated.  Blame Coors Light and my lack of will power.  Admittedly, before I really start in on this stuff, I know its going to be all over the place.  The tips of my fingers feel numb, yet I'm able to type well enough.    Here's the crux of it all.  Yes, once again, in what feels like a never ending cycle of disapointment (some hyperbolie (sp?)) I have once again found out that a girl I've been somewhat interested in, is in fact, interested in someone else.  And as always, I got to meet the guy face to face.  He seems decent enough, so long as you discount the fact that HE IS A TEACHING ASSISTANT IN ONE OF HER CLASSES.  Getting a Doctorite in Communications...interesting.  If I wasn't an English major maybe I'd have some moral or intellectual superiority to judge him on.  But I don't.  I'm just way bummed. Back to negative square one.  I've got nothing except self doubt, but that isn't very fun to cuddle with late at night.    Can't blame the girl, she's super sweet and if she digs this guy so be it.  Things probably wouldn't have worked anyways.   I feel as though I'm lying to people if I don't tell them the truth about my stomach stuff, yet if I do tell them, I fear they'd never want to be around me, especially in a romantic sense.  When the question is posed if I think that someone would be incapable of loving me cause of what I've got, my knee jerk reaction is, "No, of course not" because as that question stands, I don't believe it.  But when I think of all the subtle, latent and underlying issues of everything, it becomes readily apparent that I don't believe I can be loved, and moreover that its going to take an extrodinarily compassionate and understanding woman to understand.  I don't want to resign myself to singlehood, cause I don't dig it, but I don't think anyone could handle everything that I really am.  I don't even know what I want.  But I do know I don't want to sell myself short on a one night deal or something short term.  In addition, I also know I feel uncomfortable in any situation when I think there is the possibility of something romantic, and the lack of self confidence I have is utterly astounding.  When I was dumped or rejected in the past, one of the first thoughts I'd get was, "Their loss"  As of late, I haven't felt that and find it tougher to believe in as the days go by.    Random note:  To add to the perfection of misery, as I was slowly, drunkenly, realizing that she was crazy for this other guy, as her roommate told me as I waited for beer, "Hummer" by the Pumpkins came on and I was instantly transported to another place.  Not better, but actually worse.  "Hummer" is off of Siamese Dream and I listened to that album incesently freshman year, while as I look back on it now, I was fooling myself with the illusion rather than reality of a relationship.  Anyways, this is rambling a bit more than my usual taste, but "Hummer" always seemed to play as I was walking back from the Undergrad library and I would look to the sky, see the sun smiling back at me and I would get goosebumps thinking about the way the end of the solo dovetailed into Billy's exclamation of "I love you."  Those lines echoed and I always thought of the same girl.  And now, I can't stand to seeslashtalk to the girl that I once pictured and sadly, I think whatever window of oppritunity I had with Miss "E" has gone by the wayside.  Thought she did want me to call her tomorrow about going around as Sid and Nancy.  We'll see.  I just miss (but is miss the right word if no one was ever there in the first place) having solid female friends to lean on when I was feeling emotional/vulnerable.   I have "Say Anything" here at the apartment and I would  really love to be able to just snuggle up with someone special, (miss "e" perhaps) watch it and for 2 hours feel something special.  The closest I've come in the past few months was some incidental contact from a girl in my ice skating class whose leg brushed up against mine as she skidded into place against the boards.  Her voice was soft and she apologized for bumping into me, and I said it was no big deal.  Her hair is light autumn brown, curly (doesn't that always seem to be the case) and her eyes are very particular and remind me of Kate Hudson...damn it why do the girls I see, and are attracted to fall into distinct catagories?  Well, children, this drunken rambling looks to be losing its head of steam.  Counting tonight, I've spent about a handfull of nights at bars drinking solely trying to either a) get through the night because someone's boyfriend is there, b) drinking because a potential is showing up or c)  Realizing I'm not the one.  Can't I just have something good happen to me for once?

      Tonight, I ventured into uncharted waters and decided to put my money where my mouth is and gave myself a mohawk (with a little help from my roommate).  I like the look, even thought I frighteninly resemble Travis...I'm thinking about going into Rentertainment and asking if they have Taxi Driver just to see what they do.  I also plan on:  -wearing very "cute" clothing to offset the fact I have a mohawk -having a really fun time during halloween -going bald and then getting to play billy corgan  post script-I still hate southern illinois and if I were to become gov. I would make chicago and suburbs streatching out to Rockford cede from the rest of the state.

      I found myself flipping through the infamous catalouge over the weekend and re-discovered that contrary to what I wear on a daily basis, I have a very keen eye for fashion sense.  Without seeing prices, I somehow managed to pick out the most expensive items on each page, thinking I'd look good in them.  But then I realized, its rediculous to have a sweater that costs $275 when my coat was less than half of that.  So I'll continue to wear white undershirts, and ill fitting jean jacket (compliments of someone who didn't know how that whole "Lost and Found" bin worked at LFHS) and wear my one pair of good jeans until someone decides that I need a makeover-on their dime.

      I can't wait for Thanksgiving break.  I know it isn't good to start looking forward now, but lets face it, Southern Illinois sucks hard core.  Today I went to get a prescription filled and the rushing frat boy behind the counter (I saw his pledge pin, It's not just me stereotyping) informed me that since I last got the prescription filled on the 5th of Oct, it was too soon to get it filled again, and it would have cost $80.  I explained that the dosage changed, and he said that I'd have to have a doctor tell him that.  So I tried calling the Dr's office.  Of course, they only do business til 5:00 and I happened to call at 5:15.  I tried the afterhours nurse.  She told me to call back in the morning.  Granted part of this falls on my shoulders because I didn't notify Osco that the prescription was upped, but if someone would have given me a heads up on all of this I wouldn't have to make another trip to Osco tomorrow and wake up early so I give the nurses and insurence people ample time to fuck things up so that by the time I come back from classes I can have some medication so I don't curl into the fetal position due to pain.  I ask for so little and get less in return.  I miss compitent nurses and people who have worked at the pharamcy for more than a few weeks.  BLAST!

      Finished with story, for now.  Its 15 pages, the longest "short story" I've ever written.  Even better, its completely fictional, in the fact that the characters are not based on anyone I know (myself included).  I did use Lake Forest/Bluff as the setting.  So deduct creativity points because I'm in love with those cities.  Or at least my memories of those cities.  I really like the story, first time in about a year I was excited about the ending of it.  Some may find it sappy, but I think it's senitmental in a sweet way.  I also blame this on seeing "Say Anything" on Bravo last night.  I watched with a bitch on my lap, wish it was a girl...  The weekend was pretty good.  Gorged myself on Carson's ribs and pork chops Fri. Paid the price Sat.  Didn't leave the house, in fact barely left the couch.  Had a dog by my side almost all day.  Watched ESPN Classic footage of vintage Jordan. Got confused by all the new numbers for channels.  Wound up watching the OC Marithon with my Mom, making sarcastic comments all the way along.  Watched "One Fine Day" WHY??????  Saw the Yankees lose, took a small amount of joy in that fact.  Switched the clocks, woke up, watched the Bears got on a bus.  Wrote for 3 hours.  Had Domino's cheese steak pizza.  Wrote for another 5 hours.  Read the Monk, listened to Sabbath.  Ah.   Rest is coming.  There's something about fall that makes me want to be close to someone thiiiis much more.  Halloween is coming up.  I don't have a costume.  But I think I'll shave my head and groin and glue in appropriate hair where it doesn't belong.  Won't that be a convo starter.    Party goer, very scared, in a quivery voice: What are you supposed to be? ME: No idea.  If you want this new story I did, let me know, I'll electronically inundate you with pretentious self loathing.  Signing off kids....  PS I already miss my dogs

      Its my fault for drinking it, but none the less, here it is 2am and I can't sleep.  I'm going home tomorrow and really looking forward to a weekend on the couch with a dog by my side.  What I'm not looking forward to is finishing off this story.  And by finish off I mean write it.  We decided to head to downtown, to get far from the post-parade stampeed to cars to our favorite place.  Though it was essentially a hot dog stand situated inside the first floor of a converted teniment, the cobblestone street, small dimensions and quaint heart back shaped metal chairs gave it the feel of something European.  The gold leaf lettering of Left Bank situated between an oversized hot dog didn't hurt either.  The old man's smile was geniune whether it was your first trip in, or if he had seen you grow up before his eyes.  The kid in front of me ordered, and when he moved over to pay, began to dig frantically in his pockets for the extra few dollars.  He was a few bucks short.  I started to paw through my pockets hoping to find some change, but Mr. P cut everything short announcing, "Don't worry about it, just take it."  The sandy haired kid promised he'd come back in an hour with the rest of it, but again his offer was rebuffed with a simple "Just enjoy."  He moved off with his tray as Mr. P finished ringing up the sale, called out his characteristic "What can I do for ya?" and then had a glimmer of recognition and a smile came across his face "If it isn't Mr. Scott.  How are you my boy?"  Tangent:  He had an old school work ethic and charm to match.  I suppose it came from him owning the place and being around so long, no one could remember a time when he wasn't there.  He was around before fast food and even thought a health conciousness had cut into his business in the past few years, most people would agree it was his charm and cheese dogs that kept people coming back.  Busy days were few and far between in recent times, but on those rare occations when all the seats were filled, the most valued customers got to sit in the back room.  It was tough to imagen a space tinier than out front, the back managed to feel cozy but not clostrophobic with a myriad of family pictures decorating the walls.  Its here that I had met her.

      It's time for a new story folks.  Here's what I gots so far.  And yes, I must give credit where credit is due, the title comes from a Zwan B-side.  Things are pretty open ended as they stand right now, but I kind of like the poetic vibe I've got (or at least I think I do).  Sandals rhythmically slapping against heals, I follow her down the path.  Weather beaten logs act as steps and in the distance I hear waves crashing and can see the tops of white caps in the distance.  We settle in at our normal spot. The bluffs look like mirror images of the waves, water substituted for sand. Green grass peaks over the top like wisps of hair of a baby. A cove dips into the lake and sunbathers are stretched out as if they are in an amphitheater.  For the most part we are alone except for giggling kids a ways away. Adventurous kids, some who can't read the warning signs, and those who chose to ignore, climb on a man made isthmus of jagged rocks leading out into the waves. Neurotic mothers wave their hands in a helpless sort of way and scream for their child to come back in safely. The kids milk the situation and pretend to slip on the rocks, incensing the mothers and it draws a chorus of giggles from the co-conspirators who are wrapped up in challenging the incoming waves with broad motions with their hands.  Shrieks of children alert all to incoming waves and as they crash against the rocks. As the water retreats underneath the rocks, a slow slurping sucking noise is made sounding much like a belly swollen from drinking too much pop. I used to be one of those kids out there, but freedom ain’t what it used to be. * * * The 4th of July used to be about the parades, the spectacle of deafening fire trucks, squad cars and marching bands, water guns, a hammock in a tree and a trampoline

      Today, it was a good day for the most part.  I learned an ex girlfriend is getting married to her bisexual boyfriend at a courthouse in May.  Please don't let this reflect on me, I was smart enough to realize she was crazy when I was going out with her.   I'm going to do probably the first scholarly research on the representation of 9-11.  I'm actually excited about this.  I ate food outside my apartment and drank and didn't panic about it.  I inadvertantly got drunk off of Blue Moon.  I killed a mouse with my Psych textbook.  I get to go home this weekend.  Oh yes, and best of all, I got her number(s).  Don't know what it means, but I'm excited.

      I think one ironic reason why I like blue moon is cause I get to drink it, well, once in a blue moon.  And for those of you wondering, I'm currently enjoying the Belgian brew.

      I also failed to mention in my previous rant that if I happen to be fortunate enough to get into this last Rhet class, I will more than likely be working with the same professor I have right now...   Also on an unrelated tangent, I stayed up til 3 am last night with my roommate, going through  intricate detail of my harrowing ordeal two years ago.  Though the audience was biased, it gave me confidence to know that I'm not just wrapped up in my own little world and yes, she was in fact, a cold hearted beeeeewithacapital Byatch.  He believes I will forget all the bad stuff when I find the right girl and I essentially believe the same.  Cept its been 2 years.  The search is long, but I'm hoping the payoff is even greater.

      If you've been reading this thing for the past oh I don't know, few weeks, you've come to realize I haven't been too happy with my rhetoric class.    Today, the news got better.  I've been looking forward to this next semesters writing because its one on one with a professor of your choosing.  Or so I thought  Due to budget cuts (wow there's a shocker) and more students than usual, and less teachers, not everyone gets to take this final Rhet class.  Which means in order to finish out my degree I might have to take an intro to poetry class.    Not only do I NOT want to write poetry, I also don't want to have to put up with sappy "poetry" about chicks and their boyfriends, or emo boys about girls.  If I thought short story classes were brutal, I have a feeling this thing will be above and beyond.  Plus, I've saved up three or four stories that I've always wanted to work on, but saved them for a time when I can spend a lot of time crafting them, and not having everyone in my class look at it.  Now it seems that chance maybe gone.  True enough, I can still write the stories, but I don't get credit for them in school and I doubt that they'd get published.  God I love going to a public University

      On the whole, the weekend was better than planned, minus the fact that I've got some kind of cold going on.  Aside from that, I feel pretty good, and that's a plus because the last week was shakey to say the least.  I was really dreading somebody visiting, but it turned out to be ok, though it left me increadibly sad and I've yet to put my finger on why.  But I'm thinking it has something to do with good memories clashing with the reality of now.  To be sure, I'm just not happy and I can't think of any way to fix it immediately.  I'm doing all that I can, but all I want to do is sleep.  Whether that's due to the cold, medication or other things I don't know.

      I might have over reacted just after the game, thou I did stare blankly at the television for a solid 20 min. before I could find the will power to move.  Shocking does not do justice to what happened.  Fortunatley, there is another game to be played.  And I'll stick by what I said when the Cubs were up 3-1, if they can't win 1 game out of 3 with Prior and Wood pitching, they don't deserve to go to the World Series.  So Woody, prove me wrong.  PS  The Yankees still suck and I would be really hard pressed to root for anyone, should God forbid, Florida meets the Yankees.  I also think I'm going to boycot televsion and sports in general until 7 PM tomorrow evening because seeing replays of tonight will be brutal.

      sunken treasure There's rows and rows of house, with windows painted blue. With the light from the t.v. running parallel to you. But there is no sunken treasure, rumored to be. Wrapped inside my ribs in a sea black with ink. I am so out of tune with you, I am so our of tune with you. If I had a mountain, I'd try to fold it over. If I had a boat (or bone), you know I'd probably roll over. And I leave it on the shore, I'd leave it for somebody. Surely there's somebody who needs it more than me. I am so out of tune with you, I am so our of tune with you. All the leaves will burn and autumn fires then return. All the fires we burn, all will return. Music is my savior, and I was maimed by rock and roll. I was maimed by rock and roll. I was tamed by rock and roll. I got my name from rock and roll.

      I ah, well, it feels like I'm back in high school again.  Why?  Cause the only thing I have to look forward to (on alternating days) is getting to see a few down to earth girls.  And at night I lie awake and worry about things, classes and whatnot.  What to write.  And the more I think the worse it is.  I kill creativity with my mind.  I get an idea, a personal sort of thing, and it means the world to me, but then I stop.  I don't want to offer it up to the class or my professor.  I'm so selfconcious it makes me sick.  Literally.  I think more about everyone else and reactions than myself.  Answering simple questions about me requires a few minutes of thought.  Cause I don't know.  Or in reality, it is that I know, but I think of ways to frame so I can hide the truth.  I should be an actor cause I study people and situations.  And I always get the compliment, "But you seem so normal" or "You are the last person I'd expect to hear that from."  Well, when you don't know the whole of it, I guess anything can surprise.  This past weekend sucked and while I'm trying to get into the habit of thinking positively, this one ain't shaping up any better.  A blast from the past, whatever, or what you will call it.  I'm gonna be jumblie, and feel like I'm gonna throw up.  She'll talk about things I once wanted to hear, but now it doesn't even catch my ear.  I'll stare at my shoes cause looking at her is dangerious.  I try not to think about her, and I've been fairly sucessful in forgetting details and the blame.  But everyonce in awhile something pops up.  When at some point things felt so ingrained little memories pop up out of nowhere.  Apparently the color of lime green does it for me.  And confessional writing.    I learned to write electronically and only now do I understand compassion can't be sent through volts.   I'm 22 what can i do?    Everything.    But for now, I'm going to grow a prison stach, call who I've needed to for the past month and look for distractions in a little white ball and the hopes of a city 58 years in the making.

      Hallinan declined to give details of the plans, but he confirmed the area in and around the ballpark will be patrolled by the FBI, National Guard, baseball security officers and police on foot, motorcycle and horseback. On Sunday, police in riot gear took up positions in and around the ballpark before Game 4 was postponed by rain. http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2003/news/story?id=1637326  When you need the National Guard for a sporting event, you know something is really important.

      This Red Sox game today will go down in history for a lot of reasons, more of them not worthy of discussion but none the less I shall give my thoughts.  -I'm a Sox fan, but a Cubs fan first, and seeing Pedro toss Zim aside was wrong.  You can argue that Zim shouldn't have been out on the field, and that point is valid, but seriously if you're Pedro can't you merely side step the charging bull instead of "helping" him to the ground? -The assult in the NY pen.  Can't comment too much cause I don't know many facts, but if the Yankee's pitchers nailed the guy in the mouth and he had to go to the hospital for cleat marks on his back, something is seriously wrong.  I'm sure there was plenty of security/police presence around the place.  Call one of them instead of deciding to beat the crap out of some guy. -Yankees won, making tomorrow a must win.  But Boston has been in worse positions  On to brighter news  Cubs are one game away from the World Series.  Do I believe?  A resounding yes.  I hope it gets wrapped up tomorrow.  And I don't want to jinx (a word all too framiliar in the lexicon of a dual Sox Cubs fan) what's going on, but I have to like the Cubbies chances should Zambrano not be able to close things out tomorrow.  With Prior and Wood being the last two starts if they are needed, things seem to be good.  You could say I'm causiously optomistic.

      Yes, so over the past few days I've realized a few things.  And reader be aware this is esoteric, but I've realized the reason travel and my precived inability to do it, comes from my association with travel to relationships.  Because all the relationships I see around me that are somewhat decent all seem to have the common element of traveling together.  And its something I've always wanted to do, even before traveling carried so many other implications.   I'm also starting to feel very pissed off again, cerca last fall, and this isn't a good thing cause for the most part I'm feeling better, but things ain't right.  School is pissing me off, my roommate's myopic self view is pissing me off, and an inability to truely express my thoughts to someone without fear of being judged are all plauging me at the moment.  Will these things change soon?  The grades maybe, the outlook, that's gonna take some more work

      You know, there have been some occurrences in the past few days that make the inner pessimist think eminent doom is upon us...  -the fair citizens of California decided that Arnold is the most fit canidate to lead that state.  -Sen. Hatch of Utah has introduced a bill saying that Presidential canidates  don't  have to be born in the United States to become, well, President. -this is a big jump, but using California as the template, how great would it be if that bill goes through, and some how, 34 states think this is a good idea. -then we have someone from oh I don't know, pick any nation in the world that hates us. -someone decides to run -gets elected -desolves the gov't   far fetched, but keep in mind the Cubs, Red Sox and Blackhawks won tonight.  Oh and there's a full moon.

      Following in the shitty wake of Creed's Scott Stapp being too intoxicated to perform a full show last Dec. at the old Horizon, and the subsiquent sueing of the Band for essentially sucking, some very adventerious fans (and possibly greedy lawyers) today followed suit by suing Limp Bizkit for a shortened set this summer.  I'm hoping the legal precident set by this litigation is that shitty bands don't tour in Chicago.

      Another semi-obscure Family Guy referrence.  Before sleep gets the best of me, I feel complelled to finish the story of the story I wrote, in the week of the last.     I thought it wasn't too good at the time, and when I got it back in class today, there were no positive comments on it, and not really any negative comments either.   Suggestions of cutting it down in scope and introducing the first person narrator sooner.  Solid possibilities I just feel so frustrated.  When I write a story, I've conceptualized it for over two weeks off and on, and I think that things are set.  To go back and rework is a pain because it goes against what I've already built up.  Perhaps I'll post parts of it as is.  But most likely not.  I keep saying and thinking I've got a great story inside, but it never comes out and I guess that means I talk a lot of shit, without knowing it.

      Title says it all doesn't it.  The rant can wait.  The Sox did win by the slimest of margines and so far, this past month and a half of baseball between Cubs and Red Soxs (not together mind you...aww screw explaining it) has proven that my heart does in fact beat, and I respond to stimuli.  Damn the Yankees.   I wish I knew how to do this, but you all will just have to be resourceful...Go find sound clips of Stewie from the Family Guy.  They are out there, and are priceless.   Or rent the DVD's.  Best stuff ever I tell you.  Also, I wish that when you read my lines, you hear Stewie's voice, because, well I rather like his tone.  BLAST!!!!!

      I'm struggling hard core with creative writing because I don't feel like offering up personal details to the wolves in my class.    More reasons why my self confidence is low -I got a 75% on my Psych test...first c in college, besides that test in Stats, which prompted me to drop the class. I was hoping there were erasure mark mistakes.  I was not so lucky -I got a 87.5% on my Sex test.  Disapointing only because I should get an A in the class. But in the diagraming portion I found the clitoris.  I should get double points, a gold star or something right ladies?  I think later tonight a hardcore rant against the man-squirrel in my rhet class is coming.  For now its Boston Red Sox playoff baseball and Family Guy.  College life does have some perks I must admit

      Well holy shit, the Cubs won!!!!!!!!  To put things in perspective, my grandpa (rest his soul) never saw anything like this.  And I'm hoping that more amazing stuff is about to happen.  My exhuberence for tonight is fueled by feeling good and drinking beer, but as I try and be analyitical, here's my perspective.  The Marlins series will not be easy, but definately doable...  Looking to the AL, if the Sox can win tomorrow (HOPE THEY DO), it will be Boston vs. New York and I hope those pinstriped mfs go down in flames setting up a Cubs Sox World Series, a true Cubs Sox WS, none of this White Sox crap.  The only thing that soured this night slightly was the fact that some complete rag decided to bring in the "Go Cubs Go" song and they played it every damn commercial break starting in the 4th or 5th inning.  And it didn't just play during the breaks, it frequently ran into the game itself and was particularly annoying during that whole "did Kenny catch the ball sequence."  Cause it was necessary to hear the song for the 47th time in a row.  But the important thing is the Cubs won.  And for you Sammy supporters out there, look at the stats: -one more strikeout than hit in this series -a sparkling ave. of .188 -besides making the grab in the 9th tonight, the best thing he did was  not  swing and take walks.  And pretend he could steal bases.  Remember that attempt for 2nd base earlier in the series.  I don't think the Cubs could figure out a way to spend $16.8 million any better  Beisbol beisbol beisbol besibol swing beisbol

      Hi, hello and welcome to the first installment of Jimmy Slapnutz, live and intoxicated.  There are so many things.  First, the Cubs lost, sending the series back to Atlanta with K-Wood going tomorrow.  Here's hoping that the Cubs can squeeze out one more game and live to fight another day, against the fightin' fish.  How sad is it that the Marlins knocked off the Giants?    Fortunately, the Red Sox won, saving them from elimination, at least for another day.  I watched Trot Nixon's home run and screamed aloud.  No one took notice, until I wrote of it here.    Most promising thing.  I went out tonight with a group that I didn't know, and I think most every one enjoyed me.  Especially the girl that invited me.  Turns out I was working under false pretenses and she is no longer with her boyfriend of 6 odd years.  If she has someone else, I can't say, probably does.  But for a brief few moments I felt alive.  There's something about making a girl laugh when you're just being yourself that can't be matched.   I didn't drink out at the bar for fear of stomach issues/ the ride back home, but I did when I got back to her apartment, and that my friends is what accounts for the current inebriation (and my inabiltity to spell/care about the fact I can't spell inebriation).  While some might construe this rambling attempt to reconstruct the night's events as silly and drunken stupidity towards the said/afformentioned(yet not named girl), let the record state I thought she was gorgious back when I met her Sophmore year and furthermore, she's got a great smile and a drive to get everyone involved with events and making sure is all right.  Dig it baby, she's good, yet probably unabtainable.  But she did say (whether drunk or not) that I'm rather funny.  We shall see.  God, loneliness is rediculous and I shall now crawl into my bed (which I spent over approx. 10 hours of the past 24, currled up with a blanket and a pillow, for a sense of security and proximity I haven't known in over a full 2 years).  To say my love life is on the decline is a great exaggeration.  And I shall end my rant like this:  The birthday girl got a sex toy for her birthday and her roommate threw it at me in order to make me feel "involved" with the party. Such is college life.  I consummed three or four beers under the span of an hour, ate pizza, and then had two doughnuts when I came home.  Guess tomorrow will be a test of my systems ability to handle gluten/ see how much the treatment works.  G'night and here's to fond dreams of a beautiful girl in a white shirt, and grey sweats.

      I'm thankful for Remicade and my family.  Outside of that, it feels like I don't have much else.  I hate the Suburbs and I hate school.  I have no friends...sure I've got people to hang around with but no one to trust.  I realized that a few days ago.  Everyone back here is still living like its high school.  I've grown up and moved on.  I have more fun hanging around my brother and watching tv than going out.  I'm looking forward to Mondo Generator and hoping it doesn't turn into an event as all things around here seem to do.  I'm in the process of writing a letter trying to get the Techno Kids kicked out of the apartment complex.  And for some reason it isn't going so well.  I've been sleeping a lot this week and not looking forward to going back to school.  Although this week has taught me how much I should get serious about finding a job cause if things suck now, they're gonna be that much worse after graduation.   For lack of better things to do, I found out my WPM is around 65 w/o mistakes.  WHOO

      I finished the last story of my undergraduate career.  And got a boner while writing one of the scenes.  True story.  Thought you should know.  It involved holding hands and being wrapped up tight in a blanket at Lake Michigan.   I'm getting MTV2 for free this week for some reason.  Novel concept of learning about new bands through video form.  I'm going to sleep so much this next week.  Buddy Holly ignored my presence for the second time in a row.  Is it so wrong to want to talk?  I fell in love with my story, wishing it was true.

      That's right, I'm using this as a source in my "Fancy Ass book report on 9-11 the comic book"  The french hate us right?  So this should be good.  Fortunatley someone translated the froggspeak into good ol' American English.  God I'm sick of "patriots" on TV flapping their right wing lips about a liberal media...Anne Coulter I'm looking in your general direction.  But you know what, I also respect the fact we have FREEDOM OF SPEECH so they are allowed to do whatever they please.  My dad used the term Jail Bait in an email to me today.   I have only one paragraph written for a story which should be at least 10 pages and is due before 5pm on Thur.  I plan on just writing about when my dad was in the hospital, make it kind of sentimental.  Maybe it won't be totally fictional, but right now I'm sick of writing about shit.  I read a theory book on comics called "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud.  Smart stuff, deceptively difficult.  Brings in deconstruction stuff.  That's some stuff I don't want to visit again, but its rearing its ugly head...damn lit theory.  And guess what, one of the leading advocated of the movement was a frenchy frog...You know, for all that America says is wrong with France, they are producing a shit load of more intelligent criticism across the board.  We give them freedom fries and Rush Limbaugh.

      Not like a pirate...My epic paper on why prostitution should not be legal is finished.  All I have for the rest of the week is a story.  And I have no "ideas" and by that I mean stories that are fictional. Could just tell personal stuff.  Don't necesarily feel like it.  Want to write about love, but don't remember what its like.  Would severly be lackin in the "details" and "character development" sections.  Friends are getting job interviews.  Meth, I hear you callin' me...err rather Reality I hear you calling me.  Seems like my roommate is hatching a plan (probably won't go through) to continue to live off of others.  I don't plan on being a part of it.  I'm thinking about calling a girl, her birthday is a few days away and I haven't talked to her since August.  Had a dream about her a few days ago.  She was in a white/silvery dress and crying.  I was consouling her.  Even my dreams are real.

      Yeah, you'll probably have grown tired of this, but I'll say it again.  I hate techno.  I called the cops at 3pm yesterday because the floors were shaking, not just in the living room, the entire freaking apt.  It eventually stoped.  Then started again at 7:30 and went until 11.  Began at 1:15am, but less loud.  I could sleep.  So that's a bright spot.  I'm considering writing a letter to the landlord or something.  Cause they were listening to music today and suprise suprise the floors didn't shake.  They can control this.  Assholes.  Seriously.  I can't wait for Thanksgiving break.  The only big thing I have to do, besides the arduious task of writing 3 pages on why prostitution should be legal, is come up with a new story.  Overall, the last one was well received the major complaint was that it was thin on details and they wanted more of the characters.  Which is basically the best criticism to get because that means the readers are digging it and want more of the good stuff.   One written comment pointed out that it sounded a lot like Good Will Hunting-which as I look back on it, does resemble it a lot, and not just cause the main character is named Will.  A Fruedian slip of sorts.  To be honest, it crossed my mind that it could be constured that way.  So long as the class didn't get into a big discussion about it.  Someone also made the mistake of writing "you and maggie" (main female lead in the story) instead of Will and Maggie.  Author is not narrator you incipid fc's... Everyone also wanted more details of the relationship and I thought to myself, well that would be one astounding piece of fiction cause I have no idea how to write that.  When you wish upon a star, a cricket dies.

      In the continuing saga... I called my landlord today to let them know as to the loud doings below, and they said "keep calling the police" and "I left a voicemail on the guy's cell phone telling him to be more considerate."  Yeah, I'm sure the message of please be kind to others will get through their skulls because having the police out over half a dozen times has really modified their behavior.  The true test comes in about an hour or so.  If I here one goddamn vibration, the police are coming and fines will be handed out.    Now I realize this might sound a bit over the top, but its something you just have to live with/through to appreciate.  Everytime I'm out watching tv later in the evening, I feel the couch vibrate from bass and then I'm chronically woken up and have trouble falling back asleep.  School and life are enough to deal with, I don't need to be tired as well.  On the brightside, I can't wait for Thanksgiving break...I'm going to try and leave here Wed. cause, lets face it, I think I can miss some classes.  My only obsticle is getting my next story done for Rhet class.  Nothing has been written but I'm thinking of doing a big farce on the judicial system with some guy being put on trial for being a romantic.  Opening scene would be overly dramatic, possibly even like Law and Order, and then they read the charge "Being a romantic in the first degree"  Character then says "damn"  I also plan on constructing a scene in which a family dog gets up on the stand, and speaks in lyrical verse and basically says that he walked in on these characters having sex and he licked their feet.  A character witness of sorts...  As for grades, they are looking better.  I'm not quite sure how this system works, but by my English Major math skills, it looks like with Extra Credit, I have something like a 101% on my last psych exam-effectively taking me out of the "C" dog house for the class. That was a reference to a grade, not some lame ass nickname...if you call me "C" dog, expect a Suge-style drive by.  I also did very well on my Sex test, missing only one question.  This weekend I have to write a paper on Why Prostitution should be legal and find "academic" sources.  There goes my interview the corner workers method.  Research for 9-11 the comic book is coming along I guess.  I went to the Comm. library the other day and checked out 15 books on comics, theory and the history of comics.  I walked up and the girl working looked at the stack with amazement.  I commented it was research.  Then she saw the titles and gave me a look.  I tried to explain, she didn't get the concept of Spiegleman's 9-11.    Professor and I are thinking about having a visual display to go along with my final thesis at the end of the year. I'm all for it.  I would love to shock and offend the hell out of the people down here.  And maybe a few will think, and question.  And I will have won.   Oh yes and I almost forgot (and most importantly)  I enjoy eating Starbursts...

      Last night, at approximately oh I don't know, a time when most normal people are asleep, the frauterism twins decided to turn their apartment (and subsequently mine as well) into Club Techno.  I couldn't stand it.  Called the non-emergency number yet again, but this time decided to speak with an officer.    The music stopped, she came upstairs and told me how absolutely pissed off she was at these two down there.  The dispatcher has their names and I guess any more noise problems result in a hefty fine.  Good to know that the system still works.  And I can try to get back to falling asleep before 2:30 AM without being woken up.

      Hey kids!   I just finished my second of two papers for this week.  I think it took me just under an hour and a half to crank out a 5 pager.  And my 7 page one on Maus took only 2 hours.  I'm so glad I can write these things so quickly nowadays.  This obviously doesn't count re-writing time, but who cares.  This week is shaping up to be busy, not with a ton of effort, I just have to be lots of places at different times.  Lots of dr. appointments.  And meetings about my future and trying to find a job.  All of which will seriously cut into my nazi killing time.  I got Metal of Honor on Sat. and played it from 6:30 til 4am.  Haven't done that in a while.  Felt like a loser at the time.  Talked about it today with a girl and she thought it was pretty cool (for some reason) and patted my shoulder.  If only she didn't have a boyfriend.  She also mentioned that she likes to cook when she has the time.  Such excellent marriage credentials I tell you.

Tired, somewhat bummed I didn't see It Burns tonight, but overall just down cause I'm not feeling good.  And not in "i've got a cold" more like the meta stomach stuff.

      First off, I was very disapointed to learn that the white stripes and flaming lips show costs $77.50  per ticket  before Ticketmaster charges...I know its New Years and a special show and all, but seriously, why charge at least double a normal show.  For that type of money for a ticket, I expect some serious champaigne...and a hooker to sip it off of.  Second,  it looks like I'm on my way to becoming a 9-11 scholar.  I'm reading "White Noise" right now, and the irony of the main character dreaming up the "department of Hitler studies" is not lost on me.  On Sun. I photocopied the works I will use in my paper and today I went to visit my professor and he had them all laid out on a desk where he and a collegue both stood anaylizing them, there eyes a-glow with the intellectual possibilities.  It scared me a little.  And reminded me why I don't think I could be a "serious" literary academic...cause it ain't that serious.  But if I could get published, that would be way cool.  Saw the Matrix pt. 2 and then 3 two hours later.  3 is better than 2 in my book, but nothin can beat one.  Got that?  I'm off to sleep and rest up for the big day of psych lecture and ice skating.

      This evening, I watched two episodes of "Queer Eye" and though I don't have much ground to speak on behalf gay men cause I'm straight, but I would think some gay guys would have issues with the way they are being represented.  First, a distinction that comes from a gay friend of a friend.  The gay guy hates "fags" or his own derogitory term for gay guys who are so flamboyant that they are almost a characture of gay men.  But he enjoys gay guys, basically regular old people who happen to be gay.  I would think that the fashion guy on Queer Eye would raise some red flags in the queer community because he is so flamboyant and constantly makes referrences to gay sex-as though that's the only thing that he cares about.  And that maybe, but its dangerious to have this guy so front and center because it merely perpetrates the myth that's all gay guys thing about.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe a large part of gay culture is being different and flaunting their sexuality.  Its just from what I see coming across on the screen, the actions further myths and pigeonhole gay men as being funny, into clothes and sex.  Why can't there be just a regular gay guy on?  Like the food guy?  He seems pretty regular and decent and doesn't have to constantly announce his choice of sexuality.  I guess its different because I would be a part of the majority and don't think that I have to use my sexuality necessarily to define my personality, but for gay men or women in general, that is the big difference and in part is what gives them a sense of community.  I realize that I don't have much footing for what is written, but it just seems that while on the one hand it seems great that this show is enjoying so much success, it may ultimately backfire, for the American populous is going to see distinct stereotypes from a few individuals and jump to conclusions.  Whether the fault lies on the people making the assumptions or those that put the show together is an entirely different story.

      I have resigned myself to taking the intro to poetry writing.  Now, I know from my personality psych class that positive thinking can make a big difference in how one experiences things, but I have a feeling this class is going to be fucking brutal.   That''s why I want to play the game at a different level.  While sorostitutes are busy rehashing feelings for boys, I plan on writing under the impression that whatever I produce should be able to be used as Slayer lyrics...This insures that no one in the class will like me, b) women will be scared and c) I'll keep myself entertained.  Writing about entrails and disembowlded corpses will be AWESOME.  Or better yet, I'll write sappy poetry that claims to be about breakups and feelings and  then  add the lines of disenbolwment...Yes it will be good.  I also decided I didn't want to put up with the same rhet teacher I have now for another semester.  I already have nightmares about the man yelling at me, (though he doesn't really yell) and as I was walking home with Buddy Holly and Pete the other day, they both expressed similar dissatisfaction for his lack of teaching skillz.  We all have no idea how we are going to be graded.  I know this will sound wrong, but I don't care: At least I know I'm not the worst writer in the class cause the slighty mentally retarded girl who chokes on her phelm is heading up the rear.  At least I'm better than one person

      Had my first hard fall of Ice Skating today when someone, who didn't understand we weren't playing for the Gold in capture the flag, came flying at me, clipping my skates, sending me airborn and ultimately wound up landing straight on my back, knocking the wind out of me.  I closed my eyes for a few moments and wheezed in blackness.  I don't like the feeling of not being able to breathe.  When I opened up, a few girls were standing around and I skated it off.  Then I had to sit in jail...I've been downing asprin 4 at a time throughout the day.  Hope this doesn't negatively impact that big Ice skating test on Wed...   Oh yes, I got all the classes I wanted.  Now I just have to find a professor who wants to work with me on a Senior Thesis.  I think I'm beginning to see the light.

      Ok, so its November.  Traditionally (in the sense of college time) right about now, I'd be looking forward to going home for break and hopefully "hooking up" as the kids say with someone.  This year, none of that anticipatory glow.  Makes me a little sad.  But also lets me know how much I've learned...women suck.  No seriously, I've become more selective, yet not any luckier.  For some reason, whether it be the tides of the moon, the chill in the air, I always seem to revert back to Siamese Dream around these times, and without fail, I found myself listening to it on record this evening while critiquing papers.  I guess I also listen to it cause it used to remind me of a girl.  Still does in a few ways.  But anyways, I love the album, miss the love I associated with ladies.  At the end of Nov. I used to get excited by Thanksgiving and the day after cause I didn't have to go to school and I could play video games.  Now I understand the corporate desires that lay behind that day of, or rather that a President fixed Thanksgiving to that Thur. to help generate consumer spending.  Whatever.  This year I'm using that day off to see Satan sing naked in Milwaukee.  I win.  At least for one day.

Gave me some confidence heading into "Exam week." Psych tomorrow, sex on tue. and Ice skating on wed.  Don't know if I can handle the last two...  I also sign up for classes tomorrow.  I'm hoping to engauge in Leisure studies, bowling, drugs use and abuse, "how to be an english major," introductory poetry writing and writing a Senior Thesis...Can you say Senior Schedule?

      Sadly, the mohawk was retired and I have now entered the "Bald is Beautiful" stage.  Althought, bald most definately is not good looking on white males.  With that said, as soon as I could after shaving, I donned a black turtleneck and preened in the mirror, exacting my BC like moves to perfection.  Its striking how much I can immitate that man-and how glaring a white head is on a black turtleneck.  Before the 'hawk went away, it was captured (hopefully) in its full majesty on film-rocking out.  All I can say is that it involved rock poses, candlelight and simulated sacrafice.    Later my roommie and I got the brilliant idea to take pictures with me and various records.  It went like this:  -Black sabbath behind, me contemplating Ride the Lightning  -Miles Davis behind me as I read Kerouac  And the stopper  -Lets Get it on while "reading" my human sexuality text.  The bald pics are priceless as well because I make fun of BC.  I won't say how, you'll just have to see.  Maybe I can scan the things, find a way to post them.  I don't know, might be a lot of work, but worth it.

      Commence rant:   Theres a reason I left the band, and it became readily apparent last night.  I don't get along with 75% of the band at any given time.  They don't respect the drummers awesome abilities and have no concept of how long and arduous recoding can be.  And the fact that if I don't have to be around my roommate I won't be cause I can't stand his ways.  I'm going to start making a list of all the insipid questions my father asks me in a given period of 24 hours.  My feeling is that he has like 10 of them stored an hour and if you aren't there for that hour, they carry over.  I've already defeated Metal of Honor: Killing J***  Solid game, just wish there was more to it.  Of course when you play about 6 hours a night cause you can't sleep, things seem to move quicker.    My roommate is going down to school for New Years.  Originally I thought it was to just drink but the real reason is he wants to get gifts from his girlfriend.  And I'm sick of hearing updates about her broken vagina.  That and I'm not too sympathetic to his cries of not getting any.  On the bright side I got a Christmas card from a girl I knew few years ago and she wants to catch up.  I go into this with a bit of skepticism but it was a nice gesture none the less.

      Back home.  Better than school.  Nice to feel festive and realize Christmas is coming.  Days have consisted of basically of sleeping and playing Madden.  I'm an offensive genius.  As of now, I don't have much interest in going out.  I've enjoyed being here more than being around at school.  Grades should be posted sometime soon.  So far I'm doing better than I thought.  But we'll see how the final and the two papers I did while highly stressed out work.  Time for more sleep

      If my life were a contract, I'd be looking for loopholes right about now.  I wish I had a release.  Some people drink, some use sex, others drugs.  None are viable options.  As much as I want to get away from here, I also know that changing scenery to up north isn't going to help anything.  Suburbs can be awfully isolating in winter.  Damn this all.

      A non-inclusive list of things purchased today:  -A comprehensive summary of the Beats (book form) -Whoppers -Philly Cheese Steak Pizza (by checK) -Tickets to The Locust -A woman...jk  I got an A+ in Sex class.  Talk about being overqualified and not being able to put skills to use.  So sad so lonely.  I believe in love, eventhough it pains me to say so.   South Park was classic tonight

      Why the hell am I listening to Blink 182 after resisting their pop punk tunes for the better part of a decade?  Is this really how bad new music is...sad thing is the drums and acapella stuff is interesting

      A friend and I had designs on seeing the Flaming Lips on New Year's Eve (I refuse to use that NYE crap, looks too much like new york cities initials), but decided that tickets were too expensive.  Now they are sold out.  And I have no connections with the radio station.  Even if I did I doubt that I could score a pair.  So we've been corresponding through email on various ways to get in:  jimmy-  you said you had started working at the radio station again, right? well get on it and get us on the guestlist for the flaming lips show at the aragon. go! now!  reply:  Sadly, I am not employed by *****...Funny thing is, I don't miss it all that much. Being able to sleep in on the weekends has been rather refreshing. But we have two plans of attack: 1) I would bet q101 will be giving away more tickets soon and 2) We shall beging preperations for repelling from the el tracks. I shall send, via electronic mail, detailed schematics of the Aragon, uses of grappling hooks and portable mini-saws outfitted with compression devices so that Wayne and Jack shall not hear us sawing our ways backstage. Till further correspondence...

      Yeah that new good char-lotte "lotte"  (all trendy and crap about as authentic punk as the band is) as the drink (i don't give a fuck if I misspelled it) dealing with suicide.  They think they are doing people a favor by advocating  against  suicide of their fans.  I think they missed the memo entitled "the problem" and subsiquently skipped that "against" part.  On the plus side, now they're gonna be inundated with letters from 14 year old girls telling them how that song saved their life litterally.  We'll see how they deal with the pressure.

      Ummm yeah, this year I would ahhhh, ummmm yeah   Damnit Beavis just get on with it  No way Butthead, you're always like "Hun hunnn hunn"  Smack  What I really want for Christmas but can never get:  Music that doesn't have nu-metal type lyrics.  You know what, I'm pretty damn sick of songs that constantly have whining/lyrics about how much women suck. Basically take a look at MTV's "rock" countdown and the problem exposes itself in full motherfreaking efffizzzzect.   I'm thinking of some song titled "I hate everything about you" or something really creative like that.  Band name is not important, they are all the same.  I think the "creative" process went one of two ways....  "artistic" vision  Damn, that girl just dumped me cause I suck.  Fucking bitch.  I hate everything about her.  I've got so much angst, but I just can't express it.  I hate everything about her.  Wait... (shitty, detuned song written)  "corporate" influence  Guy with cheesy ponytail talking to band in studio    "fellas.  The new record is absolutely 'kickin'  But I don't know if its reaching the key demographic of disenchanted 12 to 17 year old males.  Now, what I want is someone, you mowhawk kid you have a good enough face, yeah you'll work as the lead singer.  We need to tap that angst.  But don't do anything too subtle, we are dealing with teenagers here.  We need really literal lyrics  band members ask for definition of "literal"  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  I would also like a cool girl.  Non-neurotic, understanding funny, attractive.  It seems like so little.  The ability to wail  The ability to sing  Good paying job  Inspiration  Inner Peace  thats all for now

      Ok, so for pysch class, they gave us this packet of questions ok and they are like totally abstract, think of random word associations ok and its like its like that song man, from the 70s  (Tarantino got a hold of this)  Yeah, I did have some ec of psych.  I have no idea what was going on, something having to do with assertiveness.  But they wanted words describing situations so this is what I came up with.  awesome, cool, fearful, beautiful, sweetheart, drunken, slayer-ific, sweet, hard core, ass, gastrointestinal, infusion, satan, nightmare, screaming, turkey, presidential, bullshit, gone, pompeii, mondo generator, wailing, mcDonalds, driving, bananas, cancled, thanksgiving, leaving, hug, much love, yelling, exercise bike, hooters, creme pie, gas station, thin lizzy, snow, family, egg nog, feces, dogs, hunting, pickuptruck, phone, ignorant, ignoring, beer, jailbreak  I'd like to see what that brings up when they do the study...particularly slayer-rific...

      now is the hour of honesty brought forth from alcohol.  I hear the hooves rumbling above and below.  The sorostitutes have come back empty handed.  I hear there pleas for honest and good men, failing to learn none can be found round these parts or at bars.     in two hours it will be 15 hours since 4 pm where the dogs dance, students twich in their seats knowing another half hour of class lies ahead and a working mother of three, since relieved of paternal support, tries to sneak out of the office in time to pick up children from day care, feed them and take them to ballet while the father lays her out on his desk white thighs seperated and legal pads crumple in their yellow little ways,  and pens the color of blood roll off haphazardly as a heel of her black pumps catch the handle of a coffee mug reading "I'm the boss" are sent careening off a rounded edge and he gets off before getting on a jet to take him to new york city.  i've been reading kerouac again.  can't you tell?

      I can feel the end of the semester slowly lurching along.  I had my final class of Rhet the other day.  And shock of all things, I was glad to see it come.  But I didn't think about what it ment outside of class.  After the last stories were handed back to us, she turned and mentioned that we wouldn't be seeing each other on a daily or semi-daily basis and she was sad bout it.  I mentioned I was bummed, knowing that I could say more, but wasn't/nor will ever be the right time to say something.  That's what its like when the other person's got a boyfriend. I really enjoyed standing with this girl at the bus stop talking with her (me probably doing too much talking cause I was nervous and she was quiet)  we stepped out of class, walked for a bit.  She said it was good to get to know me more and I mummbled something likewise.  She called me a sweetheart for hanging around with her and I got a big, tight long hug.  And though we were both wearing heavy coats, it felt really so good. Not in a sexual way at all, it just felt good to be close and know that someone, in a small way, appreciated me (eventhough I had my own selfish reasons for hanging around with her...loneliness)  She walked away, caught a bus and told me to email her.  I will-its a question of what length and voice.  Once I was well out of sight I started to tear up a little bit.   Met with my Rhet teacher and I'm getting a higher grade than I thought.  Oddly enough, he's very personable outside of class.  Just wish that was a bit clearer earlier in the semester.   Acted like a Professor in Po Mo today discussing Kerouac.  Right up my alley.  Subconsiously I grabbed flannel before the class and remembered that was one of JK's favorite get ups.  For what its worth.   I forgot how much I enjoyed reading/learned in that class.     I also sat with Miss E after class and talked for awhile, making her laugh all the time (not all that hard to do).  Philosophised on why selling shit in a business sense is much like trying to have sex...I didn't make eye contact.  Could have been weird.  Wasn't.     Really wish dating was simple as wishing cause all of things would have been solved earlier.  But I ain't gonna write a song about it.

      I'm thinking I won't be having much time to write coming up.  Plus my will for even doing school work is waining, don't know why I'd be wasting time typing this shit.  Good news-turns out the jackasses downstairs are on the subleting list for next semester, which should translate into them not being here.  Thing is I had to go to the Tenant Union to figure this out indirectly through the lady calling my landlord...Again more things wasting my time. I saw a Bears game yesterday from "Club Level" seating which roughly translates into some corporation spending $285 per seat so you can park below the stadium and not have to bother with the rabble.  Seats and game were pretty sweet.  I also like the fact that seating is based on classes, cubs on the east, sox fans on the west.  And I don't think its just coinsidence that the skyboxes (cubs) are on the East side, or in view of the cameras.  The pitch of the West side is just about, if not more steep than Comiskey.  More evidence for the whole sox fans thing.  I'm sick, and Halls, tylanol and decongestents aren't doing much.  I really want to sleep.  But I've got work to do.  Got my last story of the year back.  Still no praise, only thing close to it was something about the story being ambitious...asshole.  If we get to fill out forms on this guy, I'm signing it with semen.

      Wow, I spent today paying for partying last night, realizing that there is something more brutal than English 100...English 100 hungover.  I probably already railed against this one kid in a previous post, but I'm going to do it again, if not for the first time.   Once you've been in school for a semester (or two) you realize that you don't need to talk constantly to prove how intelligent you are.  This kid didn't get the memo.  Not only is he always decked out in pressed pleated khakis and a collared shirt, he occationally wears a tie.  For what reason I ask?  He talks more than the TA and has managed to derail every single discussion we've had in the class, managing in the process to confuse the others who don't understand rhythum.  I'm tempted to email the TA and ask her to put a leash on the Logan.  Last night, my roommate and assorted friends went next door to celebrate his 22nd.  Earlier in the evening, the barkeep married his girlfriend in the bar.  In front of the big screen tv.  Nuff said.  The place was "decked out" in white vinyl table covers and bows of lace on the backs of carved chairs.  Very surreal.  Plus I got really drunk, waxing philosophic on random topics and feeding the jukebox dollars and playing Shine on you crazy diamond pt. 1-5.  Also listening to autumnal "she's a jar" and reflecting on past fall events.  I think I'll get my hair cut tomorrow.  And takes a skills inventory test, seeing where my interests lie in jobs.  I've been thinking about what it might be like to live in Canada, Toronto perhaps.  Free health care.  Clean city.  Good hockey.  Accessability to the states.  Very prelim thoughts.  I'm also in the process of trying to write an elegy to my Grandpa.  I miss him a lot these days.  Think about what it would mean to him seeing me about to graduate from college.  He never did get to see me go off to school.  Lots of times I wish he would have been around a few more years so I could ask him more questions about his life.  The stories are intreguing.

      Yes, today was a taxing one.  My first class consisted of me sitting for over an hour, listening to my Professor read his own poetry.  Then I learned the difference betweeen licit and illicit drugs (thanks for the clarification). Next I learned how to score bowling and promptly through up a 75 (with one strike).  The dude does not ablige.  Must read up in "Right up your alley" text.    Got an email back from the girl that was in my rhet class. We might try and get together for lunch, though its purely innocent cause she's got a bf (but of course).  Currently upping my collection of Slayer.  And then sleep.

      The Speed Racer media franchise of animated cartoons started as the 1967 Japanese anime Mach Go Go Go. The central character was a young stock car driver named Mifune Go. The M logo on the hood of his race car and the front of his helmet stood for his family name Mifune, and the given name Go also happens to be how the number of the race car, five, is said in Japanese, and this also appears to explain why he has a letter G embroidered on his shirt.

      Though it goes against my metal side, I absolutely love the new Liz Phair stuff I've downloaded.  I don't care if she's got a kid, so hot and rediculous.  I'm sure that statement would get me in trouble with feminists but do you think I care.  Man so good.  Oh yes, Speed Racer is on the Speed Network. AHHHHH

      I'm pretty sure that translates to "egregious amounts of hype and bs" in French.  Fortunately I did one a few years back so I could grab shots of wheat grass fo BC, so updating it wasn't as daunting as starting from scratch.  Liz Phair is increadibly seductive.  When singing about sexual things, she manages to come across as sexy and not a skank say in the way Madonna or Britney would.  Although Ms. Phair allegedly has a song with the initials HWC and I'm waiting to hear the lyrics singing the praises of man juice.

      This first week of classes is like discovering a bizarro world of academia.  Leisure studies, bowling, drugs, 100 level English.  Its so crazy.  If the past 3 and a half years were like this, I'd have a had a 4 year (albiet very expensive) vacation.  The question now is what to do with my time.    So far I've just caught up on school stuff and settling back in.  And I'm sure in a few weeks it will be devoted to studying comics and shit.  I've also realized part of the reason I like home more is that I'm not alone for over half of the day (though if I were there I would complain that I'm never alone).  Now there's lots of time.  Suppose I'll work on a resume and finding a job.

      I almost went record hunting the other day, but missing car parts thwarted the attempt.  Researching online, I realized the place had some rare Sabbath and Ozzy, and only a day or two later, it seems as though someone has bougt the aforementioned items.    I'm itching to listen to these Wilco Demos.  Speaking of, the band finished their "EP" and some songs are pretty solid.  Though I'm biased, my brother really has to take credit for how much he fixed things up.  The process of eq-ing the tracks and getting levels proper with varying vocals was quite the challenge.  I've got about a week left back at home and beginning to be unable to be around my father.  Questions (nearly all meaningless) are constantly fired, if only to be broken up by ranting about random topics or yelling at someone.  Fantastic stuff.

      I found it difficult to get out of bed today.  I would have more of an excuse if, let's say, my legs were broken, but I just didn't want to get up.  I've found it almost crippling to get out of bed on days in which I don't have class.  Staying motivated is a problem.  This whole thesis/job search is reminding me of when I had to write stories over the past year.  Cause I'd only get "work" done if I started playing guitar, believing that I was being "productive."  So when I get scared that I won't find a job, I start working on my thesis.  And then when the problems arise, I start surfing on the good ol' intronet for jobs.  I'm so inexplicably scared and as Jeff Tweedy would say "Lone, lonely, alone."  Nothing seems to satisfy and I dislike a majority of the population at this school and area.  I feel tounge tied and wonder if I can really carry-on a conversation with out being negative about something, or letting on to all that bothers me.  Inherently, I know I'm good, but I don't think that counts for much these days.  I see girls in my classes and they are so absolutely beautiful it keeps me from ever saying something.  I used to believe that things would be better if I had a lady to confide in, but now I don't.  And with every passingdayweekmonth YEAR! it seems more difficult.  I can't even remember what it was like to be excited about something.  Christ, its been about a year since I was last on a date.  If I could cry I would.

      I'm angry at C-SPAN/ the British Gov't for deciding to take a break from airing the Prime Minister's Questions.  What shall I do with my Sun. nights now?  Now that its beginning to warm up (and that's relative due to living in Illinois) I pledge to walk more.  Cause I saw my father's eating habbits over the weekend and realized  a) Genetics are not going to give me a washboard stomach  b) I don't want my stomach hanging over my belt, creating some weird fashion statement.  So I walked for 30 min after dropping my car off.  I don't know if my nose is plugged, but I was breathing hard at points.  Not good.  I'm also sweating heavily after little tasks, which would concern me except that two or three different meds I'm taking all have side effects of "excessive sweating."  Which is fantastic now, and should be positively stink-rific when summer rolls around.   PS  I keep having dreams that I'm in Wrigley Field.

      Well, the phone wrang this morning. I picked it up and it was the matinance guy from the place I rent from.  The first thing I said was, "Wow, this isn't buzzing."  I don't think he did anything to fix it, it just stopped apparently.  Or maybe SBC did something. I don'tknow.  Its just nice to have a phone again.

      God damn that was a bad pun.  Ok, so I haven't had a working phone in over a week.  Its starting to get really annoying.  My roommate did leg work today, figured out it might be 75 for a guy just to come out, despite the fact the contstruction workers are at fault for killing the line.  This has lead to a monumental decision.  One I've dreaded.  The possiblity of having a cell phone.   God damn it.  I'm adding telecommunication giants (SBC cough cough) to my official shit list.  If I do get a phone, I want it to be one of those big honkers, like at the beginning of the Hey YA video.  Not cause it was in the video, because having a phone that big just mocks all those other fucks who can't live without their phones.

      In order to soothe the aformentioned friend, I put together a Queens sampler, in hopes that the rare nuggets I've accumulated through the past year will lesson the tragic blow of no more SATAN singing about C-C-C-Cocaine.  I just like writing and typing C-C-C-C-Cocaine.  Works well cause I'm in a class about drugs.  And according to Rick James, "Cocaine is a hell of a drug"

      I had a crazy dream last night, believing that I would not graduate because I got a L- in British (as if it were a forgien lang.)  My computer is back and living thanks to magnificent work from a tech guy at my dad's work and Windows XP.  I can now rip songs from CD to MP3.  I offered up Coldplay's "A Rush of Blood to the Head" as a sacraficial lamb, secretly hoping that it would eat the CD.  You know things are over exposed when you hear, oh I don't know, the beginning of "Clocks" and your eyes expect to see some MTV image of sorostitutes getting ready for a night on the town.  Actually, that song is more contemplative, so they'd probably save it for someone going to find out they have cancer.    Chapelle (sp?) Show season 1 comes out on Feb. 24.  Uncensored.  As it should be.  I am going home again next weekend because let's face it, Champaign sucks after a few years and now that I've got the means to get home on my own time, I'm going to.  Even if the accelorator sticks to the floor.  Made for interesting moments coming back home today.  I wrote a poem (FOR CLASS) about Lake Forest today and referrenced Cocaine and Heroin.  And hot dogs.  Tomorrow, or actually in less than 8 hours, I get to sit down and talk with my Dr. about feeling not so awesome.  You know things are fucked when you have to bring a list of things to discuss to an appointment.    I just found out I'm linked on Dave's site.  Hello anyone who's lookin'   Cheers.    Oh how technology is glorious (when working).

      First with the good:  Wilco's new album is coming out June 8th.  The bad: Satan has left QOTSA and apparently Mark Lanegan is gone as well.  That leaves the dude that's from a perfect circle and a drummer who is not dave grohl.  Oh and J. HO.  Which I guess is ok cause Queens is Homme's band, its just that him with Satan screaming (and his increadibly adgile basslines) made the music interesting.  We'll see what happens.  OH and let me say that error messages that blow up your computer are (in my book) completely and utterly awesome.

      Dear Ladies of my poetry class,   While I have emencely enjoyed your "coming of age" stories in poetry form, I am rather sick of hearing about tampons and training bras.  I understand that these are "large steps in becoming a woman" but I don't need the bloody details.  Seriously.  I don't write poems about getting hair on my nuts or waking in a pool of man goo.  I just figure that you see my facial hair and realize I've past pueberty.  And I assume that if you are in college, you have menstrated and I am willing to believe you without describing a warmth flowing from you every month.   Good day,  Jimmy

      But it's dealing with metal subjects like war and honor....  In Honor of Leaving windblown broken stalked cornfields at the age seventeen for the bloody shores of Iwo Jima. Whether victory or defeat collecting those who would go home, you moved in with grey armored fleet. God only knows what you saw.  In August of 45, that war ended another began for 50 years, all arguments ended with  “Yes Dear.” Peaceful Buddha belly resting comfortably next to matching blue Laz-y Boys. White shirt slicked back wisps of used to be patches of brown hair.  In fake anger you’d turn the corner arms raised, fingers coiled like the you were about to decent on prey “Who’s sitting in my chair?” with squealing child glee I’d scamper away on sandy shag carpet  only to sit again when you went away.  In the fields of knee high,  Traveling well worn dusty gravel paths Slightly moving tassels of sweet corn on the 4th of July You’d say, “Start ‘er up” and “Easy on the gas” I remember the familiar refrain whether it was pick up, tractor or combine.  Hearty frame weathered to a slim rail blending in with sterile white sheets a bruised eye from the fall. Football sized growth protruding from your side A lone stark silo sat out your window the only view of world outside.  In the hall with florescent light reflected, long stretches on a green linoleum floor hearing mechanical bleeps and compressed air to help you sleep, I prayed and cried for the first time trying to forget the look of Morphine glassed eyes.  Can’t believe this is real. Black casket disappears- minister says words. Fire Blue triangular flag handed to widow Fire Goodbye Fire    For the record, the fire at the end refers to a 21 gun salute, not being cremated (as some dumb women in my class thought).

      For my money, there is no more entertaining show on television than the House Of Commons on C-Span.  I generally watch on Sun. nights, but a friend told me that it airs live 7am on Wed. mornings.  And I might just have to get up to watch it.  This week was so HOTT (with two t's).  Tony Blair ripped the Conservatives a new one.  Unfortunately it was cut off after Blair basically called the opposition leader a coward.  Now I can't find transcripts nor video.

      Tonight was life altering in a good way.  I don't know why I thought of this sooner, but I absolutely recomend anyone hip enough that has a turntable to listen to LPs at 45 instead of 33.  The best records to experiment with are RUSH, Van Halen, METALLICA Ride the Lightning and Yngwie Malmsteen (or anything fast).  Weezer Blue sounds like punk, ska and soul!  But goddamn if Inagoddadevida isn't the funkiest thing around.  And I don't know if the demons were chased, but my vinyl copy of Pinkerton now plays correctly!!!!!!!!!!!  It hasn't worked since I got it and now, after the exorcisim its perfect. YES!!!  I hope I don't have hw due tomorrow cause this was way too important.

      Ah spring break wooo, such fine memories of...the couch.  I actually did quite a bit of reading.  Not for school of course, but on the life and times of one Bob Dylan.  And then I finished my vinyl collection of said man with a trip to chicago.  Weezer took up a good deal of the week.  For hardcore fans, the "digitally remastered" version of Blue really isn't anything and trust me, my ears are sharp.  The bonus stuff is cool, but since I'm apparently a very ravenous collector I had most every song on it.  And I wouldn't have known the difference between the "origianal" SIAS and the other version if it weren't for the liner notes.  (but the difference is there).  Apparently there are bout 7 weeks left in my undergrad career.  And I've been contemplating how much I've missed out on.  I'm scared of the future, but things have to get better.  Right?

      Perhaps its due to the late hour, but I've starting thinking of Grad. school.  And like most things, I'm shooting for the top.  My new Pepperdine is Stanford.  Cept if I get what I want, they pay for it all.  The trade off is that I would have to re-learn Spanish and pick up a new language entirely.  That would suck a lot.  But who knows.  I've got clearance to display "No Towers" and I've been thinking of ways/where to promote the thing.  It would be great if it offends people and/or opens their eyes.  Who knows.

      Technically, it was 3 years ago yesterday, but I was up writing a paper and slowly sipping a MGD, so my thoughts had to wait (and I'm sure you all were waiting with baited breath).  Anyways, 3 years ago I fell in love for the first time, as in more than a crush or some sort of pipe dream.  At a Weezer show.  (I reserve the right to revise history if I in fact become a metal god later in life).  That said, three songs into the set, the Eagles Ballroom was bending under the weight of 2,000 kids singing along in perfect dual harmony, in mid hop I looked right and connected with her eyes.  Time stood still blah blah blah and then we both fell to the floor, trampled under eager pushing to rush the stage.  Oddly enough, a mere year later, roughly around the same date, I had the worst 3 day ordeal of my entire life and will, for so long as I live, have a burning passion of hatred for Iowa City, the University located there, and the types of people I was surrounded by.  I remember these dates not because I have a particularly good memory, but because I rarely forget a concert I go to- (still able to remember the first one I ever saw Oct 5 1996 Smashing Pumpkins with Grant Lee Buffalo at the Rosemont Horizon) and there are elements I deeply miss, not of the particular lady, just the illusion of thinking that someone cared and I had something to be excited about.

      For the second time in a week, I've declined to go to a show due to excessively high ticket prices.  I like Rush, but considering I saw them twice two years ago at $65 a pop, a ticket for one show over $100 isn't going to fly.   I've been listening to Dylan so much, I'm growning a fro and sluring words.   My hand is shaved and I'm ready to be infused.

      That Pink Floyd is exorbitant and completely over the top is nothing new.  What I realized as I listened to the Wall this evening was how much more predominant the random noise in songs are in the mix.  Between the heavy echo and panning of lead vocals coupled with random car squeals and children's choirs, its easy to see why the Sex Pistols happened.  But I still love the album, despite the fact that it just sounds like an ego trip.

      We pulled into the parking spot at some generic suburban mall, night's black sky punctured by humming concrete lights overhead.  I began to well up with tears, apologizing for not being more attentive to the family during the break and not realizing how great it was to have support when things weren't going well.  As I borded the bus, I settled in against a cold window, watching rain slowly trickle down as others bid farewell to their parents with overly dramatic bear hugs and massive kisses like they were headed off to the South Pacific and weren't expecting to come back.  Slipping on a pair of earmuff sized headphones, Dylan's word's made a vengeful smile creep across my face.  But It Ain't Me, Babe No no no it ain't me babe it ain't me you're looking for babe

      Bob Dylan weekend was pretty sweet.  Crowd age ranged from 2 to 65.  I love the Aragon, dislike Graduate Students in Art History who yell at women who "breathe down your neck."  I dislike neo-hippies.  I had great sight lines for the show because the geriatric crowds back's are compressing due to old age.  Bob Dylan thinks he's a cowboy, and no longer plays guitar.  I recognized only 4 songs, and that took some work.  I fell in love for a few moments hoping of possibilities.  I danced but did not sing and moved my hips.  Riding back on empty train, long lonely drive down dark encrusted Green Bay Rd.  Too many hours in a crampt Honda, wishing for better things.  And friends.  Went through withdrawl of caffine.  Got my fix and did a paper, ran into a girl I hadn't seen in a while and snagged free pizza and listened to the crystalized vinyl voice of mr. bobby dylan.    you got nothing to lose.

      Apparently my brother believes my infidelities should see the light of day:   http://www.ujournal.org/users/mitchkramer/   There are two main componets keeping me from having a child.  Actually just one, a woman.  That and I don't want to be a dad right now.   While I'm on a sort of related topic, I would like to state for the record I wish not to be bitter, particularly towards the opposite sex, I wish to love.  But ideals are just that aren't they?

      Here's some more shlock about childhood and whatnot (though its not all true)  Apple Tree Get Away With red woven leash, she leads down a broken path.  Nose to the ground,  Beagle jowls puffing    Continuing forward on a scent. My body arches resembling the letter C.  Six year old struggling Black tail wagging   Back and forth, like a metronome keeping time,  the white tip looking  like it dipped into a can of paint.    From rustling stubby pruned bushes leapt a sharp black nose  and flowing mane of German shepard fur.   Two gigantic woofs   Ring out like cannon blasts. I hit the black pavement hard.   My view resembled a dropped camera.   Lines of broken asphalt are patched together with tar.  A doe like behind followed by a red leash was all I saw of my faithful companion,  seeking refuge anywhere but here.   My eyes rolled  Seeing snarled pointed canine teeth with slow moving drops of drool rolling down blackened jelly jowls.   The leash disappeared behind a garage.   The owner’s voice called “Sam” the dog relented. With skinned knees, I had no time to hear the apologies-  I now had to track the hunter.    Running through backyards filled with bric-a-brac  of sandboxes with shovels standing in frozen motion and yellow discarded wiffle bats,  Fearing Freckles had run towards the highway   I come upon a clearing. Bounding up grassy hills,   I cross a loose gravel path.   I see a squiggly line  looking like a sidewinder had wandered through.   But on closer inspection there were traces of four distinct padded puppy paws.   I call out her name seeing,  paws in the air, tail wagging  as she covered her scent  slowly rolling in fermenting apples.

      Does anyone remember the show "Alex Mack" from the mid 90's on Nick?  There's a girl in my English class that is nearly a dead wringer for that girl.  Unspeakable beauty, gleaming emerald eyes and one of the best smiles I've seen in years.  Even her voice is cute, light sounding, kind of questioning, easy on the ears, just as she is on the eyes.   Am I enamored?   Yes.   Is this post emo?   Yes.   Am I drinking a white russian?   You bet your bowlin' ass I am.   I had a beautiful dream this morning.  Its the most disapointed I've been when waking up in over a year.  I'll write it out in more detail when I can think lyrically.

I would be drinking but I an't feeling hot.  Poetry sober tomorrow will be brutal.  One of my lame ass poems was selected to be read.  I really want to read some of the shit I wrote while drunk.  Its much better cause it don't make sense.  I'd be pretty sweet if I had some more alright people to hang with-- I was thinking about this the other day, and not only have I gone an obscene amount of time without a gf, it has also been over a year solid that I had a spark withsomeone, 2 plus years if you count a spark happening on both sides...I ask what the fuck.

      To my Drugs class:      Hi, my name is Jimmy.  I attend class regularly when not imbibing vodka on lunch break and napping it off.  You probably don't realize this, but I'm fairly intelligent.  I've invested a lot of time in working on a thesis as an undergrad.  So trust me when I say that I know how to research and get pertinant information.  However, you and your demonic, shadowy step child "course administrator" have decided that the sources culled from Congressional Digest (readership just a smidge below People) are not infact 3 sources, but count as one.  This fucked up math has contributed to me waisting time and effort finding more jackoff articles about crack cocaine, which is cool in its own way, but when I would rather be focusing on more important things, I am  enslaved to your pointless exercise of source hunting.    Fuck off,   Jimmy

        Watching the cubs game on tv yesterday I spotted a guy sitting in the front row that stood in front of me on the El on the way to the last cubs game.    I am currently thinking about writing my last poem entitled "Getting Hair on my nutz and jacking off"    Billy Corgan used a Native American flute player in his "solo acoustic" show at the Metro.  God save us all.    I am apparently in between a spat in the English building and still waiting on getting my paper back.    I plan on purchising Kill Bill Vol. 1.    I need to find my "motivation" for acting in English 100. (I plan on blocking the play and using a lot of jacking off motions)      School is futile, I'm only doing it so that I don't fail.    I need to see "Naked for Satan" and "Women in Cages."    Actually you need to see those two titles as well    I have been enjoying beer as of late.    Poetry is gay.    Poetry written in class while drunk on beer, Kaluha and wine is above average.    I didn't get tickets to see G n R plus Weiland for my B-day.  I'm mildly bummed    I'm bout ready to hunt down that fuck with the digital camera and take pictures of my foot up his ass.

      Driving while extremely tired at 80 mph is not the most advisable thing to do.  I'm generally a very safe driver, (definately definately a good driver) but I cut off one person and then almost got sideswiped by somone going 60 on 176 and switching lanes without signaling...  Cubs game tomorrow in an attempt to relive a small section of the movie Ferris Bueler...Senior Ditch Day 2004 WHOOO!!!  Though the naughtyness of cutting classes is lessened a) by not having classes on fri.  b) a parent will be attending the game with us and c) we're in college, by this point its expected to not go to class.    And I didn't go to class today.  Rather, I was in class and was convinced (rather easily) to take off and watch the Cubs game.  I also am beginning to not care about my thesis.  Matters are not helped when my advisor has canceled/not shown up/ failed to tell me he couldn't meet with me in the past 3 weeks.  Whatever, I've got 19 pages and 6 pages of quotes I want to use and the paper has to be 25 pages.  You do the math, I'm the English major and I don't care for numbers  I have also begun to "mentor" a freshman in my english 100 class.  He's so cool I didn't think he was a freshman at first. I hope my words, trials and tribulations save him from wicked bad professors.

      And I know you've all be anxiously awaiting what my thesis for the paper would be:  Spiegelman's "No Towers" can be read as a man's attempt in the words of trauma theory, "to make sense where this is none." Shifting from a grand collective conciousness of America in the opening episode, Spiegelman moves to personal moments in an attemp to document events, frustration and anxiety felt in the weeks, months and years after 9-11, culminating in a unique style which branches off his previous work "Maus"-- encoupassing many perspectives and roles (victim, bystander, and post memory generation) to document the personal and collective truama felt after 9-11.   Whew... One sentence, almost a paragraph on its own.

      What could be better for an Easter Celebration than a Fantomas show I ask you?  Nothing! Mike Patton is a God, I read it on a t-shirt.  I was less than 5 feet from Patton playing insane conductor and Dave Lombardo playing the trash can and the cymbals with a violin bow.  Best performance I've ever seen.  Now all other music sounds boring.   Cubs offense needs to be consistant to win.  G. Maddox needs some control.   I have 19 pages of rough draft ready to rock for the thesis.  I might actually enjoy the Cubs game Fri.

      Yes, I gave into the lust I have for new  good  music and found Wilco's "A Ghost is Born" online.  Early attempts were thwarted by a German website and an inability to download the program.  Then, as if the heavens opened, at 3:30am last night, an English version of the page appeared and an hour later I had Tweedy's new opus.  I've listened to the album about 6 times through today and am currently enjoying it via burned CD.  People on various boards have called it a logical progression from YHF but I would argue that it reminds me more of "Loose Fur" (and then some hipster would say that was an off shoot of YHF...and at that point I would punch his latte drinking mug).  Ambient noise and fuzzy guitar leads dominate "Ghost" and while it proves an interesting listen, Wilco is at its best when putting aside the atmospheric gimmics and gets down to the core of the songs.  "Late Greats" and "Hummingbirds" stand out as two shining examples of a band playing together with tasteful overdubs.  The 9 min. of noise on "Less Than You Think" follows in the vein of "Reservations" from YHF with less musicality.  "Wishful Thinking" stands as a great synthasis of what the band can do with atmospherics, a regular band mix and moving down to sparse parts.     At times the mix is agitating (though most likely on purpose) as in "At Least That's What You Said" as the beginning is barely audible until turning up the volume, and then being blasted by drums.  These sorts of experiments with mix detract from the song(s) as a whole, though would probably sound fantastic live.      For all the minor detractors listed, this is a phenominal album on first (or sixth) listen and stands perched as an album that grows on a listener with time.  Jeff Tweedy's voice cuts through the songs in a clarity not yet heard on any Wilco album and Stirrat's basslines demand attention as an intigral part of all songs.  As for the drums, Kotche's presence is not as up front in YHF, but still solid and dependable as ever.  An attempt to follow up an album the likes of YHF would be nearly impossible for any other band, but Wilco, a band always known for taking chances and changing on every album, is equal to the task and will not disapoint hardcore fans and novices alike.

      Of published writers (or I will soon).  Never did I think it would be for poetry.  At least its a poem about my Grandpa and it includes stuff about war, so its not like flowery poetry.   I was also plesently shocked that I have only 3 weeks to complete my Honors Thesis and as of now I have 0 pages out of a minimum of 25 done.  But I've got 14 pages of rough draft material that may or maynot be used.  If it is used, I'm in a lot better shape because another 10 pages would be cake to spit out.

      Much happening on the job front.  After a few emails, I'm about to set up an interview-ish situation next Wed.  While I think publishing is something I'm very interested in, I am NOT interested in sticking around Champaign anymore.  Though air conditioning and a nice apartment could change some of my perceptions.  The locals, will not change.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.    The downside of the emails I sent out comes in the form of Buddy Holly getting a forwarded email...One, I doubt she'd respond to the email and two, wow, wouldn't that be a fabulous work situation.  I'm coming to realize as well that I might have to do an internship if I want to go the route of PR/Media/Marketing stuff.  Which would suck because I want REAL MONEY, REAL HEALTH INSURENCE, and a REAL PLACE.  But I guess I could gut it out for a few months if the payoff down the road is a job offer.  Its just I would want the job upfront.  However, nothing is done or set in stone.   post script A year ago today I met Billy Corgan, which means I'm better than you.

      I actually did download both wilco sets and both are marvelous.  I'm guessing the taper was on the otherside of the bar cause you can't hear the frat boys asking what the weather would be the next day during Reservations.   From the hours of 9:30 to 11 I did some serious hunting for jobs on-line.  I have a meeting with a Career counselor on Thur. and I'm hoping things will start rolling quickly.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but the entry level jobs for the PR firms I've been looking at are in LA and San Diego!  Wouldn't that be glorious?  Champaign is nice in the fact that no one is around, but that also contributes to why I'm so incredibly lonely.  Home does have people, just a few I care not to see.  Oh I'm fickle.  Ps  I blame the late hour for my exuberance of using such words as "marvelous," "glorious" and "exuberance"

      Somehow, I managed to get a B in poetry writing.  Funny thing is, and I've noticed this with quite a few different rhet classes, if I got a B, what the fuck did other people get?  Perhaps he smelled alcohol on my breath for the last 2 weeks of class, figured that I didn't care about contributing to class discussion unless absolutely imparative, or perhaps it's because I didn't follow directions on a few poems.  That being said, it should also be noted that I turned in at least 3 extra assignments than were necessary and that my comments were of the highest quality I could muster while dealing with the dog shit of the others in the class.  Whatever.  I've graduated with a 3.79 and that's pretty good, honors or no honors    PS I've decided that trying to download and convert Wilco concerts is too much a pain in the ass and takes up the precious little memory I have left

      If music were drugs, I just moved from beer to herion.  There's a website called sharingthegroove.org and I think I've just found my new distraction.  As I type, I'm 90% through downloading the Wilco show I saw a few days ago.  Then I plan on downloading the Velvet Revolver show I didn't get tickets to-the two Wilco shows I saw in Sept., the Jeff Tweedy show I didn't see in Jan. and some bobby dylan live in Chicago.  Then who knows.  Good thing I've got a T1 line and no one else is around these parts.  The major complication will be figuring out how to convert and listen to all this music!

      Whoohoo graduation.  So much pomp and crap?  I waited in line for about a half hour and was stationed next to  that guy .  I haven't had him in classes for over a year (thank god) but for a two year streach he was in at least 1 if not 2 of my classes a semester.  He's the type that loves the sound of his own voice and was hitting on women while we were waiting to walk in.  Also smoked 3 cigs before and after ceremonies.   We had a bagpipe open things.   I ran into at least four girls that I would have liked to have gone out with and about 75% of them didn't make eye contact...oh how grown up we have become.   I got cash, and then I got wasted. I believe I broke a few glasses inadvertantly by knocking them off a balcony.  I also managed to get food and then was unable to navigate getting cheese on fries and fries into mouth.  My head killed today.  I have to get a new muffler for the uberwonderhonda.   I want to get a replica cubs t-shirt that says BLACKSABBATH 22.

      Definition of an efficient day: Playing video games from 1:30pm til 2:00am with a break for attempting to make burgers.  Attempt fails because it is so hot in the apt. that the meat thaws and goes rotten in half the time it takes for things to regularly dethaw.  As much as I really don't want to go back home, this heat is killing me.

      Attempts at over coming technological deficiencies aside, today has been a pretty good one.  I'm digging the new template, not only the rustic windswept lighthouse (which reminds me of Lake Michigan back home, but the text of the font is like that you would find in a good book.  My anger and disbelief at the thesis fiasco has been subdued when I found out 6 others faced the same unfortunate fate as I and that in conjunction with my impassioned letter (and tons of people failing) the system as I know it is dead.  Small comfort for having so much energy wasted, but there's hope that people in the future will not suffer the same ways I have.  Moreover, my relationship with one sdavenpo is totally copacetic and I found out I was very impressive in an interview with his wife.  Both are very good pieces of news.  Unfortunately, I may fall on my grammatical face when I get the proofreading test the publishing house sends out, but I'll deal with that later.  For today, I am content in knowing that all that I could have done is done.  Even losing three straight games in euchre didn't dampen spirits-though after playing approx 30 games in the past week, my various partners and I have failed to win a game, and have only taken about 8 tricks.  Hella weak.  I would like to post pictures here, but it involves free samples of some random product I don't trust.  So for all of you who don't know me, just keep on imagining what I look like.    PS All you hipsters left out in the cold without Wilco tix to the Vic, I got a pair.  Looks like the trip back to chambana paid off.  God bless T1 lines!

      I should be happy, I know this.  I should be positively elated, overjoyed at the fact that I have finished four years of increadibly difficult tasks.  Yet, all I can think about is the time and effort I've absolutely wasted over the two years working towards an honors thesis.  Two and a half years of honors classes, papers and 2500 pages of reading per class.  Apparently, I missuse commas, have poor grammar and in conjunction with two misspelled words (within a text of over 15,000 words) have contributed to my downfall.  I could man up and say it all lies on my shoulder, yada yada yada, but the more I look at it, it becomes increasingly apparent that if my advisor had been around, I would have been in far better shape.  Its tough to second guess, but I'm the king of it.  Besides the Cubs muffing games six and seven, a particularly disasterious weekend in Iowa, this event is the worst I've ever felt.

I heard this song about 3 years ago with my roommate of the time (Sam, what's happen?) and we both ran to our computers after seeing the video on BET and downloaded it.  It takes Isaac Hayes' "Walk on By" from Hot Buttered Soul.  The same riff is used in some new Ludicris song, and while his rap is quote flowing, nothing beats Isaac and wu tang.  To compair this to Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire" cuts down the social commentary of this song, but it is like a history lesson, albiet a lot more awesome and true than Mr. I like to drive drunk Piano Man.

      Personal daily best, 4 today bringing the grand total to 8.  In other news, I have sent or inquired about 28 jobs thus far.  To show for it, one definate "no" several polite "we aren't hiring, but we'll keep it on file for six months" and a few no replies after repeated emailings (cause they don't give numbers for me to call).  Though, last night (or was it two nights ago) two entry level jobs in Portland and Sacramento opened up and I instantly sent off the necessary goods.  Those are my two best leads.  I'm trying not to get discouraged, but I'm already failing one of my goals- not moving back home.  I've got to go back.  Either the heat or the cock-a-roaches are going to get me.  Plus not talking to anyone for days on end kind of isn't cool.  Champaign you rock

      I misread a bumpersticker the other day and now I want to write lyrics to a song called "We're Proud of our Pride."  Thematically it should deal either with this faux, wrap ourselves in the flag patriotism Republicans are so fond of, or combine it with some vauge lyrics that could be interpreted as a gay pride song.  Something about Republicans, Patriotism and gay pride could make for some very interesting lyrics.  Also working on, "Open it with a brick" and "I own this note"-dealing with commercialism and the like.

      So I blew the HK editing test.  I guess blew isn't the right word cause I did what I could do and I'm obviously not cutout to be a proofreader cause my grammar skills suck.  Which now leaves me with absolutely 0 solid leads for gainful employment...Higher ed. is fab and so is the President.   I think this can sum up my current disposition:  There's a fortune inside your head All you touch turns to lead You think you might just crawl back in bed The fortune inside your head You know you're just a mama's boy Positively unemployed   Oh how JT is so right

      I'm starting to go over the pros and cons of staying in Champaign for a job... Every night I start thinking about the possibility of working as an assistant editor and it kind of scares me.  Self confidence, never had a ton, and after SDavenpo's words on my thesis pretty much burned up whatever was left in regards to editing...But every morning I wake up thinking things wouldn't be so bad.  There are some definate positives.  I know this community and can get around pretty well, as opposed to Chi. where if I'm feeling sick I would have to contend with riding the EL to get things done.  Plus, I'm guessing that getting a grand as a paycheck every two weeks wouldn't be too shabby.  But can it buy happiness?  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure I could do the job, but I'd most likely make it way more stressful than need be. Cause I like to be perfect and going line by line looking for grammatical things that may or maynot be there is really disconcerning.  And I'm starting to get these anxiety panic freakouts while going over this test...Probably cause I know there is a lot riding on it but, Jesus I can't calm down. Its the most intense mix of isolation, stir craziness, bordom, and wanting my life to get on with it I've ever experienced.  And I've already got two consecutive summers under my belt of this feeling.  Plus feeling sick don't help much.  God damn this place.  I just think maybe there is a limit of living in this town for four years for a reason.  Uggggggggghhhhhh.  Time to sleep for 10 hours and feel exausted the entire day.  What's up with that?

      I know I'm getting ahead of myself, but upon a prelimenary look at the editing exam in front of me, I think I've got a decient shot.  And that scares me.  9to5 yo.  Champaign.  Hickcentral and Frathouse galore.  The plus side is that I'd probably do a good job and traveling wouldn't be required.  Is advertising something more tangable for me?  I would get to be creative at some level.  But ethics might be sketchy.  But I could probably deal with it if I was in LA.  A friend advised in an email that I should just move to LA and find a job when out there.  It's tempting but considering I don't ever deal well with change and uncertainty, it probably won't happen.  Though I would at least have an assemblance of a network of friends in LA with a certain Sliozi.  Sad to say that after 4 years of school, I have two or three aquatances and I haven't hung out with anyone in the three weeks I've spent down here over the summer.  But the question comes down to whether I continue to repeat past mistakes and pass on the sure thing in front of me or wait hoping something else will come up.  I'm leaning towards being conservative and telling myself that in three years I can go anywhere I want.  I half believe it.  Cause by then I'll probably be tied down and unable to move to Cali, learn to surf and find an awesome lady.  But for tonight I won't take any drugs and make a clear headed attempt at a test tomorrow that is possibly one of the most important ones I have taken in my life...Sweet dreams

      Yeah for creative titles.  Ok, so I read the Wilco book in one day, all 240pgs. of JT glory.  Seems that Mr. Tweedy is not so good with communication.  On more than one occasion he dismissed band members by telling them not to show up to rehersals or something like it won't be necessary for you to come to Dublin to record.  I wish I remembered this great Dylan quote about not admiring heroes.  It escapes me, but is perfect for this situation.  Codeine definately takes the edge off, and by that I mean that I wake up in the morning (who am I kidding...after-noon) do things for an hour and then fall back asleep for an hour or two cause I'm too tired.  I keep feeling my insides twist, shimmy and shake like there was a 50s Elvis concert going on in my pelvis.  Whatever is wrong, I want it fixed quick cause pain and being doped up ain't fun.  On the upside, it looks as though the heat (knock on wood) is going to stay away for the next week or so.  Plus I've rigged a sweet venalation system to keep things relatively cool.  The cock-a-roach kill kount is up to 3 and I found return to horror high at the local video store...Goodnight codeine is calling

      His back is to the crowd, showing only a dark tweed sport coat cut in half by a light calfskin guitar strap, silently tuning for the next song. "How do you fight loneliness?" a drunk in the crowd screams out. He turns around, paces back as the drunk shouts out the question again, this time the words just a little more slurred.  "A little salsa, a little rock."     PS Iron sausage will not be performing in the round.

      Umm-so if I see another fucking website with a flash ad talking about commitment to clients, integrity or some bullshit, people are going to be hurtin'.  I've also learned I have to begin stalking these websites like it was a Wilco chatroom cause jobs are disapearing like mad.  One company had a job posted for Silicon Valley for about a month.  I went back to check and it was gone, but the same job opened up in Seattle on the 10th of this month.  I revised my cover letter and found out it was not up there today!  Crazy.  Also unbelievable is that a company that pulls in over 5 billion bills a year isn't hiring...  On the plus side, I got an email from a girl from my rhet class informing me that a job is opening up at a publishing company in town.  Fortunately I was on the ball and the editing test should be coming in anydaynow.  Most solid lead thus far.  I think money would make Champaign managable.  Oh yes, I also had an ultrasound on my stomach today.  Its gonna be a boy...or it's just a mass in my small intestine.  Considering I'm a guy, my money is on the later.

      At a recent party, a friend said, "You know what sucks about looking for a job?  Everything."  Day by day, that becomes more and more true- and I've barely begun.  I sent my first resume and cover letter in the mail yesterday and have finished rough drafts of two cover letters for public relations firms.  The thought of working in the "business" world still scares me, but not as much as the thought of living at home for any extended period of time.  I missed a Cubs game on Mon. because my stomach sucks.  I've since given up alcohol and caffeine for the foreseeable future.  I'm going through withdrawal...need caffeine, know it will hurt.  I came up with this little gem at 3 am while trying to list traits advertising companies would like.  Obsessive fans are a lot like overprotective mothers; they don't want to share their loved one with anyone.  Both bands and children alike have to grow and by the time the band grows out of adolescence (or playing clubs) fans begin to cry foul.  Fans and parents need to learn to accept change.  Yes it sucks that you can't score tickets for when the band does do an one off club show or that your child moves away, but know that these changes lead to bigger success.  Ultimately, the early days of clubs or childhood, and the memories that accompany them will mean so much more the further the band or child moves on in life.    idea for book.  From Pop to Pap: The Decline of Pop Music Since 1950.

      Suburban entertainment like listening to Boston and STP's Purple while playing hearts.&nbsp; Yes sports fans, it looks like I have topped last summer's uber-lameness once again.&nbsp; I have recently taken up reading for pleasure again and while it kills time, it doesn't help me find a job.&nbsp; I've contemplated writing but apparently my juices are still sucked out from first semester.&nbsp; I kind of wish I was back in school, but not grad school so I could not think about real life and dick around.

      So maybe I have a muscle tear around my waist.&nbsp; More Mon. afternoon.&nbsp; The trip into the city was, for the most part, a waste of time, though I did get a nice packet of info for when (WHEN LORD WHEN) I start a new job.&nbsp; I'm thinking about hiring a headhunter and then moving to Evanston or Chicago.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp; PS Sammy, man the fuck up.

      Ok, on the 4th I saw a kid in a Polo with an upturned collar.&nbsp; My first reaction (besides "Jesus does that kid look like a tool) was "who the hell is responsible for this?"&nbsp; I quickly thought that it was impossible that this kid had thought of this all by himself and while I was buying khakis yesterday (for job interviews!) I was in the gap and saw upturned collars.&nbsp; Talk about having mind control over fucking yuppie kids-The thought process or how I imagine it must&nbsp;have been something like this:  Kid walks into shop after blairing DMB from Jeep 4x4 in mechanical daze.&nbsp; After seeing polo shirt with up turned collar, "Whoa that's fucking amazing.&nbsp; I bet I can really set a trend by turning up my collar.&nbsp; What a great idea, I need to buy that shirt."  Stupidist thing I've ever seen.  If I see people doing it, I just yell "EEEEEEEEAAAAAGHHH" with double barreled thumbs up cause they don't know who the Fonz is.  &nbsp; PS&nbsp; Can some explain why the movie "Pollock" was so critically heralded?&nbsp; I knew a bit about the man before viewing the movie, but after 2 hours I feel like nothing much happened.

      Last night, after little debate from drunken friends, (and the fact I just read the book "High Fidelity") I began to think about Top 5 lists.  In the process I realized that I actually am some form of a music snob because I can't just simply put Bob Dylan in the top 5, I have to qualify it by saying from 62-71 or that best guitarist needs to be broken down into proficiency and have a seperate list for most influence.  Top 5 songwriters is also difficult because if you want to have John Lennon on the list, then McCartney also has to be there as well right.  And Top 5 albums have to be broken down into several catagories.  I'll post my findings later.     PS  My first job out of college is going to be picking up golf balls and working a cash register.

      It's the only word to describe Napoleon Dynamite. I have many bones to pick. One, using a forgein kid to get laughs is not only old but now pretty un PC. Not that I'm a big stickler for PC stuff, but after Fez on That 70's show, I think it has all been played out. Two, it was positively brilliant to make a film about a dork and the preppy kids in high school. Never been done before or better. BRILLIANT. Three, there is a thing called "plot" and generally some "character development" in stories and movies. Both were lacking. Finally, relying on a kid's goofy looks for laughs for a full length movie gets old. I will also say that the viewing was somewhat spoiled by North Shore copycat mallrats decked in A&F with glowing cellphones and fake tans.   Oh yeah, I predict, if it hasn't happened already, that this will be the most quoted (rather misquoted) film for the next, let's say, 3 months. Legions of idiots who have been craving new Chappelle show quotes are now saved and will yell "Sweet" drunkenly in the streets. And Napoleon will be the "hot" Halloween costume of Frat Boys.  I hold out that this film might pull a Lebowski and become funnier on repeated viewings, but that's a slim chance.   PS  The other thing that seriously got to me about the film was the whole "80s" look.  Actually, that's not right, it is the fact that everything looks cerca 1985 but with the Internet.  Either the writers were trying to be clever with how everyone in that town is out of the loop, or as I suspect, they were just really lazy.

      I got a new cd player/car stereo the other week and with it came a free 15 song download for Napster. The other day I downloaded fifteen songs (mostly rare Wilco tracks from soundtracks and the like) and then tried to put them on my computer. Apparently, you have to be hooked up to the internet and/or continue to have napster's mandatory software installed on your computer.   This is why people steal music.   PS  After doing more research it looks like you have to have the most current version of Microsoft Media or whatever it's called.  My version of 7 or 8 is sooooooo outdated...Plus, if you think you're gonna get wise and just convert it to something more people friendly like, oh I don't know, iTunes, tough luck it don't work.  Copywrite protection beeeeyatch.

      Quotes from q101.com   Frontman Chris Carrabba reports that writing for the next Dashboard Confessional album is going well. "I've got a lot of songs finished; I've got a lot of songs half-finished; and I've got a lot of songs half-brewing," reveals the singer, who adds that the disc will be a more collaborative effort than before. "Now we're this really great collective," he explains. "I write the poems and then we all decorate them afterward             In case he didn't get the memo, poetry is not cool.   A complete track listing for the forthcoming  urlLink compilation CD  (due Aug. 31) inspired by The Passion of the Christ has been revealed. A collaboration between MxPx and Blink-182's Mark Hoppus joins 11 other tunes, including previously announced songs by P.O.D. and former Creed frontman Scott Stapp. "It put my life in perspective," says Stapp of the film. "When I'm feeling down or complaining or trying to place blame on certain things, I think about what Christ did for me."           Oh Jesus   Also, don't be fooled by this new band consisting of 3/4ths of Creed.  It sucks even more than Creed, which is mighty difficult.  All music lovers hoped that when it was announced that Mr. Jesus Lover was spliting, the terrible music would stop as well.  We're not so fortunate, now we have two equally shitty bands instead of one.   In case you care, I believe I have about 225 cds.

      NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH  I'm pretty psyched about the trade.  I like both Boston and Cubs, but speaking from a Boston fan, jesus, what the hell were you thinking?  First, way to go with alienating an All-Star and fucking the situation ("trading" for A-Rod) up so badly that you trade him for a couple of sub .250 hitters and some minor leagures.  In regards to Theo Epstien, how exactly is the problem "fixed" as you put it?  Defense might be better and you may have rid yourself of a "problem" by getting rid of Nomar, but you could have at least gotten equal value for him.  But maybe something is better than nothing.  If Nomar was slighted by your team President, GM, and sometimes 1B, maybe he had a right to be displeased. Rumor has it, Nomar was getting so fed up in Beantown that he considered sitting for 3 weeks while recouping from his achilles problem.  Nomar might be showing signs of slowing down after missing most of a season a few years ago with a broken wrist and is now hobbled by an achilles,  but no matter how you slice it, he is a massive upgrade over Gonzo.  On the other side, as of now, the trade can only be seen as an absolute steal.  Who knows what the prospects the Cubs gave away will become, or even if Nomar will stay past Oct (all indications are he would like to) but unless Beltran turns into the second coming of Dontrell Willis or any number of other Cubs pitching prospects that have been shipped away in recient years, this looks pretty solid.   Lets face it, Bartman was not the only reason the Cubs blew game 6 last year.  Anyone remember the ole job Gonzo pulled?  The man that was hearlded for his defensive prowless.  Yeah.  Garciaparra's bat at the top or middle of the Cubs lineup will give it some much needed consistancy and baserunners, and his defense is still solid.  If Sammy wasn't a puss he'd accecpt moving to the 5th or 6th slot in the line up and let players who hit move up and have him see better pitches.  He should also realize he's not putting the ball in play and be man enough to ask for help with his swing cause it ain't working.  More middle relief for the Cubs would have been nice, but the possibility of a waiver trade is there for the next month or so and everyone is coming back from injuries.  Once Wood and Prior are able to go 6 or 7 solid innings, the bullpen will get some help as well.  That being said, the closer job is still very loose, but I'm glad the Cubs didn't go after Urbina or Jose Mesa because neither have been consistantly reliable in the past two years.   That's my take on baseball.    PS   Moving out in 90 heat sucks massively.
