      I was sitting on the bus, just starring at the sky, and this poem came to me.  Let me know what you think!  Dreams and Things  To think a thought, to dream a dream, To fill a sea, or just a stream. To dream a dream, to think a thought, To build a mountain, or just a dot. Are these gifts, are these curses, To dream and think our minds verses. What will happen in time to come, What has happened can't be undone. To dream what will be, or think what to do, Or face reality and all things true. Deep, Wide, Shallow, Narrow, All differ, but are a straight arrow. To rise up high, only to fall, Or not take that chance at all. They bring us hope as well as despair, Yet so fragile, they need love and care. To raise our spirits to the very extreme, To think a thought, to dream a dream.  Thanks!

      I believe that everyone has a passion in life that they cling to, something that without, they would not know what to do.  My passion is music.  It allows your emotions to come out and lets you express how you are feeling.  Every time I feel low, I just sit at my keyboard, play a sad tune, and move on to happy ones from there.  Music itself is an expression to me.  It is truly a passion that I would be lost without.  Passions can do that, allow you to get lost in them.  Music is just mine however.  Think about what yours is and dig deeper into it.  It allows you to get to know yourself better.  So till next time, keep a song in your heart.

      Do you own anything that seems like junk but you can't seem to get rid of it?  This are the things that we hold dear to us because they hold so much value that cannot be seen.  I've found myself hiding this memorable keepsakes so that they would not be mistaken for trash and be thrown away.  Why do mere objects mean so much to us?  As long as we keep the memories inside, what is the point of haveing such usless junk around.  However, these things hold our memories as well and to us, they should be well preserved because maybe they hold some secret or memory that we what to keep to ourselves.  It reminds me of the quote, "One man's trash is another man's treasure."

      Love that teenagers have is nothing.  It is not love.  It is more closely realated to a simple attraction or as far as lust.  Most teens do not realize what love really and trully is.  I say most because their are those few out their that feel it inside them and have that strong feeling that covers their whole spirit.  I may be a bit of a romantic but love is more than a feeling.  I is a force itself that is meant to be shared.  To show love is to express your inner most self and simply communicate with someone.  Love is such a great and powerful gift that we were given.  So fellow teens, love does not have to be physical, not in the least bit.  Just talk and let your spirit set free to share.

      This tale I tell, is about a dream I had and wish do I to have again.&nbsp; To see her face, to feel the love, to just be with her again.&nbsp; It all began, this dream of mine, locked away in prison.&nbsp; From there I escaped throught the sewer drain and felt my riteful freedom.&nbsp; For I did not deserve the prison house, for innocent was I, and see her I must, so escaped I did from the prison lie.&nbsp; How suddenly I came to a building I knew, dressed up right and went on through.&nbsp; Three stories high, the very top floor, was were I met her again.&nbsp; We run for each other, and tears did shed, for my love was with me again.&nbsp; Her hair was long, with a redish hugh, and silky to the touch.&nbsp; Her eyes were green, like emeralds did they shine, when the tears they did stream.&nbsp; She was tall and slender and graceful so,&nbsp;and the definition of bueaty was she.&nbsp; My eyes have never known such a person as lovely as she, and what a love we shared, true and stong, that words were to weak to hold.&nbsp; That night I met her parents again, a happy occasion for all.&nbsp; The next day came her father came to me, and for a ride did we go.&nbsp; Down the subcity streets did the past unfold when he told me what he had done.&nbsp; For it was he, and he it was, who had framed me for the crime.&nbsp; He sent me to prison with none the wiser, for me to slip away from his daugters heart.&nbsp; He had misjudged our feelings though and he could not break the bond.&nbsp; So now he would finish the job and rid me of this world.&nbsp; But drinking was he and foolish he got, for he stopped to refuel and left his gun.&nbsp; I took the gun and fled the scene and took refuge in a house.&nbsp; The cops did come after I apprehended him for he had gotten his rifle.&nbsp; The next thing I knew, I was at a party.&nbsp; The party was for me for I had apprehended a great villian.&nbsp; Sad was I though for thought did I, my love was gone forever.&nbsp; For with me locking her father away, forgiveness was not in sight.&nbsp; Suddenly the crowd parted, and my song did play, for there was my bueaty.&nbsp; She came to me in a flowing gold dress, eyes sparkling in the light.&nbsp; An emerald necklace did I take from my pocket, placing it around her neck, I asked her to be my bride that night.&nbsp; She of course said yes, and the story ends soon, we danced the night away.&nbsp; The air was so strong with our love in full.&nbsp; Together we danced feeling each others soul, and one was did not know that sadness ever exsisted.&nbsp; This dream I dreamt is trully a dream.&nbsp; Every word is true, through and through and I look forward to meeting my girl in reality.

      What's past is past, what's done is done.&nbsp; No use looking to where you mistakes begun.&nbsp; To live in the past is to forfit the future, so past comes alive and repeats.&nbsp; Mistakes are remade, and you move nowhere.&nbsp; To move on is the key, and focus more on reality.&nbsp; Love is lost, mistakes were made, but learn from them and move on.&nbsp; The past may hurt, this&nbsp;is true, but release the pain and soon it will flee.&nbsp; But nurture the pain, and more of it you will see.&nbsp; My past is clear, but my future is near.&nbsp; I have fought my mistakes to fix them for then, so they are not renewed.&nbsp; My lost past does hurt still, but I realize there is nothing now that can fill.&nbsp; My future is bright and I see the light, for the emptiness will soon fade.&nbsp; When love is brought into my heart, the stars will shine so bright.&nbsp; My darkness will die, true love comes nigh, and together, we will see the light.

      Whoever said it is better to have love and lost then to have never loved at all is a total IDIOT!&nbsp; When you feel true love, it is amazing, nothing else is better.&nbsp; But to have something that is so awesome that it consumes you taken away are teared down is the most horrible feeling in the world.&nbsp; It's not that it makes you feel bad (which it does), it's that it leaves you with the most aweful emptiness that is extremely hard to fill.&nbsp; You can say, well he's only a teen, what does he know what love is.&nbsp; If you say this, then I probably have a better idea of what it is than you do.&nbsp; Love is a gift and expression that you share with someone.&nbsp; Just talking and sharing your spirit with them is one of the most powerful things of love.&nbsp; Suprised?&nbsp; Well I feel alone among other teens for they don't know what it is, only adding to the emptiness.&nbsp; I try to mask it up and be happy so in turn everyone else is.&nbsp; But alas, this only addeds to the emptiness and leads everyone else to follow in their own happy worlds.&nbsp; I done with mask.&nbsp; I will act how I feel.
