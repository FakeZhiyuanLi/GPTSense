      are fucking idiots.  You all know them.  You have all seen them and interact with them on a daily basis.  My friend Jake who works at the wrecking yard knows who they are.  Well I just encountered my first idiot of the day.  Yesterday it was "guy on mountain bike" who ran a red light and had the nerve to stop and yell at me when I turned right on red.  I slowed down and waved for him to come in my direction to see if he wanted to discuss the issue any further.  It turned out that he  thought  he was tough, but he was still only "guy on mountain bike" which apparently is synonymous with "giant douche kit."    Today it was "middle-aged woman with diarrhea."  Yes that was her diagnosis here at the good ol' lab.  She came in to pick up a take-home-lab-kit to analyze her shit.  I tried to tell her she had the choice of either checking in now, or later.  "Check in for what she asked?"  I said, "the test.  you will need to get an account number for the test you are going to take.  would you like to check in now or when you return the take-home-kit?"  She replies in a harsh, confused (also see idiotic, moronic, and dumbfounded) tone, "check in for what?"  I'm not going to tell you again lady.  Did she not just read my last post?  I'm tired.  Don't be a bitch and act like you didn't hear a word I said.  Oh I'm sorry I didn't realize you were...  a fucking idiot.  I feel so much better now.  blogging makes for great therapy.

      ...and my girlfriend would reply to that, "you're always tired."  Try working a 40 hour work week once and then get back to me.  Then after you try that, try waking up at 5:30, driving 160 miles to the airport and back, and then working an 8 hour shift.  Then talk to me again.  That is... if you are still awake.  This comes from a person who works a 3:30pm-8:30pm shift monday-thursday, and sleeps past 10am every day.  ahh those were the good days my friends.  I don't think she's worthless for what she does.  I actually admire her for her work she does.  All I want to be able to say is, "I'm tired," every single day for the rest of my life and not get the eyes rolling back into the head look.  Because let's face it.  I'm probably going to be tired a lot more in my life.  As I get older I imagine I will probably get more and more tired.  Waking up earlier and earlier.  This is the common progression of life.  None of my grandparents sleep past 7.  Why in the hell did they retire if they weren't going to sleep in?

      When I pay 10 damn dollars extra to get something shipped "overnight," I would like it to be here when I wake up.  It did not say on the website "click here to pay 10 extra dollars so you can get your package in the late afternoon."  But what it did say was "overnight."  Where is my package Fed Ex?  Why are you just driving around Corvallis all day with it on the truck?  Just get it over here!  This is why you are not a Fortune 500 company, because of your laziness.  My driver is probably enjoying a 2 hour lunch.  Start working and earn my 10 dollars!   When I was in elementary school we used to do this thing called a sleep over, or an "overnight."  all that it meant was that we were going to stay the night at a friend's house, then be home the next morning.  Occasionally these overnights extended into the mid-afternoon, but usually the parents were so aggravated from having an extra body all night that it was time for the overnight to be over shortly after waking up.  No where can I find where an overnight means past 1:30pm the next day.  This is bullshit and I want my 10 dollars back.  I am very impatient today and have run out of other things to do, so the waiting for my game has become painful.

      My Grandma T just left Oregon and is in route back to St. Louis as we speak.  I didn't realize that it would be so hard to say good bye to her.  This was definitely the hardest it has ever been.  Contrary to it being hard on me on the inside, I held back my tears as I put on a smile for her and acted like it wasn't a huge deal.  But right now it is, because I love her.  She is not my biological grandmother, but rather grandmother acquired through marriage.  That really does not matter, because I am closer to her now then I have ever been to either of my biological grandmothers present or past.  I have spent more of my adult life with Grandma T, and I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.  I think its also because of our common interests, and her taking the time to get know me.  I can't say that I know many older people who actually want to take the time to have a real conversation with me, or with young people in general.  They are either too busy, or just don't care.  I love that she cares.  When we had a BBQ a month ago up at my parents house and all of my friends came over (ages 21-27) she took the time to talk with them.  Smiling with enthusiasm and interest to learn something about each and every one of them.  It was as if it told her more about who I was.  It really meant a lot to me.  I'm just always so scared (this time more than ever) that it will be the last time that I see her or get to talk with her in person.  Because of this... I kind of get quiet, or act like things are okay.  I need to tell her exactly how much she means to me very soon.  You just never know with life and death.  With a family member who lives 2000 miles away I think its always a good thing to tell them how you feel.  No matter how young or old.    She is just such an inspiration to me with the way she treats people with respect and gives every one a chance.  Not saying she is not opinionated, because we all are.  She is just a super kind woman, and I will leave it at that.  After spending the last seven weeks seeing her off and on, it will be hard to not be able to see her whenever I want to.  Therefore, today isn't as great as I thought it was going to be, however I am very grateful and very thankful for the time I got to spend with my grandmother this summer.

      and let me tell you why.  EA sports NCAA Football 2005 will be arriving at my doorstep before 3pm.  I am very excited about this and in no way can express this excitement inside of me through words.  The early previews of this game are suggesting that they have improved the greatest football video game yet again.  I'll start to make my decision on that here in a few hours.  I am a very biased person at time and can be easily persuaded.  just knowing that this game is xbox live compatible pretty much sells it for me.  It could be the EXACT same game as last year put in a different looking box, with the added feature of online play and I would be happy.  I would even enjoy forking over 60 bucks for the experience.  Now I just have to talk Brad into getting xbox live, so I can dominate him from 70 miles away and not listen to his pathetic excuses for sucking.  The tracking page tells me:  Jul 12, 2004 8:28 am  -  On FedEx vehicle for delivery - CORVALLIS OR    ahhhhhh yaaaaah!

      Welcome to my "Blog." whatever that means.  after reading these terms of service I think I need my non-existent lawyer present to tell me what I can and can't post.  Well I hope I abide by the rules, but some of them were way too broad for my liking.  the terms or service state:   You agree to not use the Service to: (a) upload, post or otherwise transmit any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;   um... what else is there?  then they go on to state:   Pyra will also  not  monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a Member's information  unless  required to do so by law  or  in the  good faith belief that such action is necessary     That's about as broad as the patriot act.  so if they feel its in good faith that such action is necessary, then they can monitor me and shut me down.  nice.     Because of these strict rules that I cannot promise to adhere to... this will be my first and last post kids.  enjoy it.  at least the service is free.
