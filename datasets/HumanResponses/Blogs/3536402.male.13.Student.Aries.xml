      hey dis is zack again. er'body should check out larry's blog  urlLink     and to er'body from hunter dats readin' my blog: wassssup homies?!?   ya, so er'body keeps askin' me about lilly. i don't know what happened to lilly. er'body seems to know about what happened tho, (thanks to larry's blog) but yeah, basically i hugged 'er and 'er "boobs" popped. it was kinda funny. but i feel really bad cause be4 she didn't stuff 'er bra she just started doin' it when she started likin' me. i know it's not my fault but i still feel kinda bad. i mean, i was just jokin dat time at riley's b-day party when i said i like "busty" girls. i mean, she should know that, i'm a retard and i say stupid stuff. but anyways, if lilly is readin' dis i want 'er to know dat i still wanna be friends. but i guess dat would be pretty hard 4 'er cause of what happened. i think lilly is a lil' pissed at me cause i broke it off wit 'er. but it's not u lilly, it's me. i don't know y i even went into dis relationship. i mean, i like u as a friend lilly and nothin' more. i'm sorry if i wasted ur time and consumed ur mind for like months before u asked me out. ya, basically i can't keep a friggin' secret 'round hurr cause larry da playa goes and blabs it. i'm convinced dat punk got adhd or sumthin', man. anywhos, er'body knows who i like now. thanks to larry. i know lilly is probably making voodoo dolls of me and hoping that she doesn't like me back. but whatever, dude.    oh crappers! "Ain't no body wanna hear you read!" (inside joke between me, jasmine, and jasmine's mom)   zack. (i don't know no foo named issac)
