       The fall semester has started for me, I begin the internship process and the final semester towards my masters. Granted I have to complete financial aide one more time. Let me tell you how stressful asking for more money again and again and again and again.       I am just tired of fighting with the university to get anything done or to just graduate. Why does it have to be so dam hard to get the financial aide necessary to graduate and do something with my life. I thought the schools purpose was to help people achieve a higher level of education. Yet I face more stress just to get the money to come to school then I have ever faced before. Hopefully if I do everything right I will get some aide by November. Ok that is today's gripe.       On the happy note. I start earning my hours towards internship I have to earn a total of 600 hours, 250 of them in direct client contact. Mathematically that comes out to close to 40 hours of work each week, and 20 of those hours in contact with clients. I think that it will be a great experience and I know I will learn a lot. So wish me luck. :p

          Long Post time...    Ok so this weekend I traveled to     Dallas     to check out a school for my Doctorate in Psychology.    This school was not what most people would consider as a real school.    This university advertised itself as a school for working professionals to continue to work on their education.    Therefore, I get there and start talking to the admissions person about the program and what it entails.    I find out that just like every other psychology doctorate program it requires a 2-year practicum and a 1-year internship.    Ok so that isnâ€™t too bad, until I find out that I would have to give up whatever job I was working in so to work full time in the practicum/internship unpaid for, three years.      THREE YEARS...No money, no moolah, no cash flow, no income......gee...no food?  How is anyone supposed to work for three years with out being paid?    Now do not get me wrong but no one is going to go into the mental health field and make tons of money.    However, I already have student loans, why would I want to get more student loans.    When will I ever pay them back?    I do not get why practicum/internship students are not paid we are providing a service just as valuable as a mental health practitioner that is out in the field.  I understand that we are still learning, but how are people going to become psychologists if they can support themselves.      Ok so that is my bitch about not being happy about the Dr. situation.    Now for the reason why I am complaining so much.    Since the eighth grade, I have been working towards being a psychologist.    I have heard and been reinforced from my folks, friends, and acquaintances to be a psychologist.    Now I am currently graduating in December with my Masters in Counseling, in     Texas     that will allow me to do the exact same work as a psychologist.    Therefore, what the issue is is that I feel like I am not living up to what I have dreamed about for a long time.    Kind of like a weird sorta of failure to myself.    I think overall I have made the decision to not pursue my doctorate for a while, because I am tired of being broke and living hand to mouth all the time.  I am ready to be an adult and enjoy being independent financially.    All right, time to be done posting.    :)

       I have three clients that I am going to see tonight at my school's clinic. Normally I wouldn't be to worried, but tonight I am being observed by a different professor then I have been observed by. This prof that is about to observe me, doesn't seem to have a very high opinion about me from previous classes.       Now I feel and have been told that my skills with clients are right on the money for my experience level. I am worried about how she will evaluate my skills. I have a very difficult series of clients to work with tonight.       Well on another note... A good friend of mine has been accepted at UNT to begin working on her masters in counseling. I am really happy for her. More blogging tonight :)

       This is my first post. :)  It has been an incredibly long week. I have worked several 14 hour days at my internship site. I am a mental health counseling intern. Basically that means I work for next to nothing. I think elephants at the circus make more then I do. I know I sound complainingish... but I really do love my work. Currently I am working with children and adolescents. Sometimes it really just means I play games with kids all day, but you would be suprised how much that can make them feel better about themselves or thier situation.   Soon I will be leaving E. Texas and moving to the big city of Dallas, which scares the crap out of me. I will be a real life serious adult. I want to leave E. Tx but I really dont want to leave the friends behind. More on this subject laters.
