       On sat nite my grandma complained that her tummy aches n she kept vomitting n her vomit   is black...!She couldnt breathe properly ²...My couz, nana, was quite scared cos theres only her father and she herself wif my grandma at home n her mum is out to a kenduri so both of dem dun really noe wat to do...My   grandma's been sick for da past few days n she is getting better but dat nite...its like...suddenly tummy ache n so on...She couldn't take it animore n told her dad ² call my aunt ² hurry home n bring her ² da hospital..My aunt hurried home and the rest of my uncles n aunties were called ² come too...Called da ambulance n brought her to the hospital...Went for check ups n stuff and found out that my grandma's large intestine or wateva has a hole so that explains the tummy   ache n da food dat she ate went out frm the hole n went up ² her lungs!So dat xplains da difficulty in breathing...She had to go for a major op...If not...there would b no hope n if she did go for da op..the chance is   50/50  .I can't believe dat it could get all serious like dis.I didn't go ² da hosp dat nite but just stayed at home and took care of my younger siblings.      After the   4 hr   op,everi¹ was so somber n deep in sorrow!My couz told me dat my grandma looked so weak and her hands and both her eyes were swollen..My aunt kept crying n she said dat she can't forget the look on my grandma's face..She said da doctor told her to '  prepare for the worst  ' and to  '   dont stop praying   ' .Of coz..she became scared..So dat Sunday..i went ² visit my   grandma.She's in ICU.These few days..gonna be in critical condition.When she saw me wif ma lil couz n ma aunt,n we saw her..all of us burst in tears...It was so   saddening   to see her like dat.Wif god knows how many tubes in her mouth..nose..hands..lungs n whateva.It seems as though she was fighting for her dear life and she couldn't do it.Da pain she endured is clearly portrayed through her physical expression.I told her ² be brave and believe that everything is gonna b all right. I held her hand.Man!My heart just went all down to see her like dat.      But my aunt told me dat her condition is getting more stable.She looked better than she did on Sat nite.And she's gonna breathe normally soon enough.Whatever it is,I'm just gonna keep praying dat my grandmother will be all right again....         »!Insya Allah!«
