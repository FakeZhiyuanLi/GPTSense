      The modern bohemian's. You know, those people and children who are artistic (think they are) listen to "obscure" music, and read poetry and write mediocre poetry. They hate yuppies even though theyre destined to become them. The hypocrites and idiots that roam the streets.  I see them everyday and all they do is quote other fucking artsy people, fuck that's so lame and boring. I'm all for being an intellectual, but not a fucking boring lifeless one. Maybe if people found their way out of their little box of conventiality theyd be able to create something worth being an artsy fatheaded over. But most likely they wont.  I mean, these coffe shop fucks that you claim to hate yet are just like....but...thats the rant anyway.

      So a friend of mine takes some disturbing pictures of himself and has them on his laptop. And a friend came across one. And now theyre exploiting it for laughs. They even painted clothes on it. Now I feel as the pseudo-resident of this house I should have been more cogniscent and aware. I should Have anticipated that and prevented them from usign his laptop. God. This is going to be the worst day ever. So much stress, so much headache. So much shame and emberassment.... I hope he'll take little to no offense over it, but I know for a fact he will because he's sorta anal like that. Never let's&nbsp; anything go- first impressions are everything with him, if you say something he dosnt agree with the first time oyu meet he'll hate you to hell. Close minded, ignorant and unwilling. This will suck.

      This is the last time I'll remake the blog. This is strickly made for humor. No more personal matters here, those are lame I'll keep my feelings to myself and stop getting into trouble.

      Doons is the coolest kid I know. If I lived in New York , we'd so be married.  I am seeking a trumpet and a violin, so if you have either contact me and I'll give you sex for them, please note- I am not a stormtrooper ALL the time.  my foot is asleep.  I hate schol, and I think it's safe to assume I hate school more than anyone else in the world. Because I broke 3 bones in my left foor just to miss 1 day of school. Thats dedication.

      You know whats funny? It seems alot like everyone who gets to see one all the time really dosnt care if they ever get to see one again. But the ones that one has never met really make better friends to one thana ny of his real friends ever did. Isnt that funny?  Bottled Pepsi = better than coke, canned coke = better than canned pepsi.  Darth Vader is overrated where would a Sith Lord be without his army of devout Stormtroopers? Nowhere- fuckin nowhere.  Being in Finland is very lame when all your friends think youre far away.  Being in Mexico sucks worse than Texico and rhyming is lame.  I miss Alex, and I miss Father, maybe it's just because theyre both in other countries because I miss other people who are still in this country too.  Planet Smashers discography torrent has been downloading all night, and isnt finished. at 93% with half an hour left. yay.  Gary goes back to Texas on tuesday and I wont see him for a year after that, unless I go to texas...which I wont. and that really sucks because he's one of my oldest friends whom I can be a total loser with and just sit around playing video games + getting fat with, the rest of you assholes have too much drama in life.  Drama in life sucks, we're young stop caring you bastards.

      It's funny that nobody reads this when I'm not Emo, Depressed, Suicidal or whining about being any of the above.

      I've posted this message from the future!! wooOOOoOOOOOooOoOOOOo.....  Chickens have taken over and the ninjitsu army is unable to hold the line after being backstabbed (star craft style!) by hamsters.  So prepare for the end NOW! buy sugar, tons and tons of sugar, and corn, leave a perimiter of corn+sugar, chickens HATE that.
