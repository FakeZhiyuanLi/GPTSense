      有时候突然很悲伤的很堕落的想给自己的身上开道口，锋利的刀口贴着腕上的动脉，跳动的血液在身体中奔流，即使心中也有些微的恐惧，仍觉得看着血液奔出所绽出的殷红是多么令人惊心动魄 ...                                                           -- 四月雪  >  Sounds disgusting ...  but I like the way this author discribe her sadness!   ---------------------------------------  I can't see my future with him. He said he gonna stay back in UK for another 5 years, his best friends gonna go there soon, he gonna have more fun with his friends over there. 5 years later ... what would I be, how would things change after 5 years? After 5 years .. I'll no longer be a young girl, I'm not sure whether our problems can be dragged for another 5 years. I'm so annoyed...   Song of the mood :  urlLink 你不在  - Lee Hom ... This is exactly how I feel now ...

       urlLink      Believe it or not, i went for a movie that i hated so much last nite (The Chronicles of Riddick). It's all becoz of Mr. Khong (my uni lecturer), he visited KK & called us up for a movie last night. The entire movie is about the further adventures of Riddick (Diesel), and i don't really understand what's going on. In fact, i dind't really concentrate on it, i was sleepy ...tired ... boring! I do like action movie, but not this kind, it's all about war & it's so violence ... unrealistic too!   Erm ... solely my own opinion only ... no offence to those of you who like these movies.   .   Alright, back to Mr. Khong! He is still the same, still having high liking preference towards football. Kind of miss the time we were in Monash. Our classes with him were fun especially tutorials. Well, he'll be staying here till Sunday.     Movies that I want to watch     urlLink    Spiderman!   urlLink    Three of the kind!   urlLink    Heat Team!   urlLink    One night in MongKok!   urlLink    Garfield!

      Got this  urlLink Love Test  from other ppl's blog, hope she doesn't mind.   My interpretation are as follows :-  1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and     free.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is optimistic.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is traditional, without saying anything, the other     will know what you want, both of you communicate by hearts.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You are afraid of marriage, you think it would take away your     freedom.  8.  At this moment, you think of love as a committment for both parties.

      Thanks to Sorenson's invitation & i finally got  urlLink gmail , where i can have 1g (1000MB) storage! Isn't that great!   Come to realise that some people can really chat a lot of things, can talk about everything, anything! Will always have the right topic to go on. However, some people will just hold an 'empty conversation' / 'speechless moment' eventhough we have lots of chances to talk to each other. Today chatted a lot with Sorenson ... erm ... we chatted about the use of condom and birth control pills, we chatted about relationship thingy, we chatted about many things! Just feel comfortable chattihg with him, he is a good brother to me ... erm ... good listener too! It may seem that i know him for very long but come to think of it, just half a year! haha ...   Also, i chatted with Bryce today. He falls in love with a girl with bf, he told that girl everything about me & him last time, that girl accepts him. Good thing is that he finally got out of himself & successfully fall to a girl. Bad things is that the girl's bf is proposing to her. They are getting married soon. *sigh* Poor Bryce!    Gonna have very very heavy rain again. Blue clear sky no longer exist in KK.

        DAILY EXPRESS NEWS     25 June 2004  -----------------------------------------   S’wakian falls to his death   Kota Kinabalu: A 36-year-old Sarawakian tour guide catering to Taiwanese fell to his death from the fourth floor parking lots of the Centre Point Complex, here, Thursday.

      Funny! Today Uncle Foo wants me to fill in my appraisal myself & discuss it with him tomorrow. I tot the appraisal supposed to fill up by him, it should be the assessment of my overall performance throughout my 3 months working here. How could i evaluate myself? Well, he said nobody understand me more than myself. He wants me to rate myself & compare my rating with his tomorrow. Alright, this is acceptable! But I'm wondering what took them so long to process my confirmation letter? what took them so long to fill in my appraisal form? Over a week already ... and am still  waiting patiently ! Peoples here do things so  inefficient  &  ineffective !   I spend so much time on the Internet each day where i have ample of times to do my own stuffs & surf my favorites sites (as long as i've finished my works). In another words, we are using company's resources to do our own things ... i'd say that i'm lucky enough to work in this company :p! All the way, i'm thinking ... how good if i can get a part time job that need tons of Internet usage ... perhaps a research base job, helping a company to do research on the Internet & come up with a report for them! Well, this is interesting ...    This is funny...   Jess went for a movie on Tue nite, she smelled some weird yet familiar stink smell in front of her. She couldn't believe it & tried to look for that stinky James & surprisingly he was there. That is his Trademark smell! Well, i pity the person sittting besides him in the cinema, how to stand his stinky smell for 2 hours?! He is so irritating ... so annoying ... so talkative ... today he sent an email with the following email add:  xxxx@hotmail.com/xxxx@yahoo.com  typing on the address column! Always wants me to teach him but he wants to 'act smart' in front of me, likes to interrupt me when i'm telling him the right way of doing it. My goodness ... don't know how does his daughter stand him!

      Finally, I figured out the way of uploading photo onto my blog! Uploaded some old pics of mine, taken in KL last year.   It's another rainy day, KK's weather fluctuates badly nowadays. I saw the sky suddenly turned grey & follow by heavy rain. Anyway, i like seeing raining scenery from the window. Some people might hate it, but I love the rainstorms scenery especially when i'm comfortably sitting under the roof.  _____________________________________________________________  Had a headache last nite & am still feeling a bit dizzy now.

      Well, it's all becoz of Wah Kon & I finally got into here! I strongly believe that this is much better compared to LJ. I've been using LJ for years & feel that I need a change.  A bit busy today, just came up with the new duty schedule for next month. I have a weird feeling here, ever since I take up the responsibility to arrange the schedule, everyone in the office started to pass me small notes stated the off-days that they want. I tot i'm the one who arrange everything but seems that they are messing up the system.    Will update more ...

       Got the chance to listen to Jay's new song from  urlLink MyFm  these few days, listened to it again just 5 min ago! I'm eagerly waiting for his album to release in KK, guess it would need some time to arrive in KK. Found this interesting website to catch Jay's latest updates -  urlLink 八度空间   !   urlLink  今年夏天周杰倫帶來濃郁『七里香』!     七里香 - 周杰伦     词：方文山 曲：周杰伦        窗外的麻雀 在电线杆上多嘴 你说这一句 很有夏天的感觉 手中的铅笔 在纸上来来回回 我用几行字形容你是我的谁秋刀鱼 的滋味 猫跟你都想了解 初恋的香味就这样被我们寻回 那温暖 的阳光 像刚摘的鲜艳草莓 你说你舍不得吃掉这一种感觉 雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水 院子落叶 跟我的思念厚厚一叠 几句是非 也无*将我的热情冷却 你出现在我诗的每一页 雨下整夜 我的爱溢出就像雨水 窗台蝴蝶 像诗里纷飞的美丽章节 我接着写 把永远爱你写进诗的结尾 你是我唯一想要的了解 那饱满 的稻穗 幸福了这个季节 而你的脸颊像田里熟透的蕃茄 你突然 对我说 七里香的名字很美 我此刻却只想亲吻你倔强的嘴  ___________________________________   Went to 'Lan Gui Fong' (兰桂坊) at Water Front last nite ... not bad!

       Just came back from one of my colleague's farewell lunch, we had buffet at  Pacific Hotel Cafe Boleh . The food are not bad, I like the stew lamb & also the bake mussels. Can't afford to eat too much during lunch time, I didn't eat much but still very full!   Went online to read some Wireless Hot Spot stuffs. Came to realise that we can actually get a tmnet hotspot card at only RM19 (for 30 days of unlimited access). That's pretty cheap &amp; affordable! To use the service, all I need is just a login ID and password (which is on the tmnet hotspot card). Just key in the login ID and password and I can experience a whole new dimension of Internet surfing! Isn't that great? However,   urlLink  tmnet hotspot service area    in KK is very limited, even Sarawak has more hotspot cafe than KK :( ... And ... my favorite coffee shop --  Starbucks  is not in the list! Neways, I'm surprised that  Just Pasta  (an italian restaurant in Taipan) has this service as well. hmmm ... speak of Italian food, I miss the Seafood Pasta in  Pizza Uno  ... yummy! ok ... back to hotspot, I probably will get one when I'm in KL. I don't want to look for a cyber cafe everywhere when I'm in KL, guess I don't have that time.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  My cousin (Fiona) is having her personal concert in Likas Trade Centre tonite. I'm gonna rush there after work later. Not going home take bath, will just take a quick shower in Marina Club ... hmmm ... not going to take dinner too (I already had heavy lunch this afternoon ... LOL).     &nbsp;  Arghhh ... Celcom line is very bad these few days ... what's the problem!? Get so frustrated with the line, so distract! Think they are upgrading but what took them so long time to upgrade ...&nbsp; I didn't see any improvements though!

       Michelle was ill & went to see a doc. After consultation, the doctor give&nbsp; her 3 types of pills to aid her - to have better sleep for diff circumstances.&nbsp;  He told her : the red color pills will give u a sweet dream with  Andy Lau , the yellow color ones will give u a sweet dreams with  5566 , while the white color ones will give a sweet dreams with  F4 .  Michelle was very happy to hear that but then an idea strike her & she ask the doctor...."then who will i see if i take all of them"??   The doctor reply.." Leslie Cheung  !"    _____________________________________________________     Went to Tg. Aru Beach yam cha with Paw, Michele, Denise &amp; CY last nite. Paw is leaving on Sat, don't know when will be the next time to meet each other. Probably next year or probably not so soon ... hmmm ... whatever lar! By the way, I was told that Paw was gossiping with my r/ship with CY. Paw ... being a nice guy & a doctor-to-be, you shouldn't be so '3 8' ... :-p    There was a guy (our contractor Welson) said I have an endearing smile this morning. Thanks to him ... actually I'm pretty proud with my smiles which everyone praises it. Well, that could be one of the reason&nbsp;why&nbsp;I like&nbsp;taking pictures so much!           My KL Trip       I've booked hotels through  urlLink KL-Hotels.com  today. Confirmed staying in Grand Plaza Parkroyal Hotel upon arrival (28/8 - 31/8), then we'll proceed to Penang trip & will stay in  urlLink The Northam All Suite Penang &nbsp;(it's an all-suite hotel, they have jacuzzi in every room, I'm gonna make use of the jacuzzi!). After Penang trip (1/9 - 3/9), will back to KL &amp; stay in Cititel Mid Valley (4/9 - 5/9), the reason being is becoz Midvalley Megamall is still the hottest spot to shop ... LOL!!! Neways, 3D2N in Midvalley is good enough to make me bankkrupt! My convocation will be held in Sunway Lagoon Resort, we'll be moving there, so that I can do my touch-up easily on the day of my graduation.     Well, realised that my entire trip is about 'shifting hotels'. hahaha ... nevertheless, I still think we planned it quite well ... !!! :-)

       urlLink   &nbsp;      Birth stone:    Emerald     You like...    Yummy food, clothes, massages, nature and being tickled (gently).     You dislike...    Naff jeans,  pushy people, ear-splitting music and   being rushed .     You're best at...    Creating something beautiful out of nothing - think cooking, art or gardening.         Deep down...     U need to know that people love u 'n' want 'em to show it.  While you're not a show-off, u do like to be noticed and enjoy getting compliments. Secretly, you are keen to make lots of money.    Your career...    Think money, nature and beauty.  Choose from banking, art, accounting, music and gardening.    Fashion:   You're more concerned with comfort than looking like a supermodel. You enjoy shopping for clothes, but don't like spending too much on them.  You love pretty dresses and dainty shoes are a must!  Although you like to look good, you don't like your clothes to attract too much attention. You like well-cut, not-too-tight clothes best in soft, natural fabrics.    As a mate...   A lovable, loyal sort, your close friends can always count on u when the going gets tough. Stubborn beyond belief,  u find it difficult to say sorry, but you'll make an effort to patch things up. And u don't forget birthdays.     As a girlfriend...    You need romance like a fish needs water. Good food, bear hugs 'n' mountains of flowers make you mushy. Loyal 'n' affectionate, you expect ur boyf to be faithful. If he cheats on you, he's in serious trouble       If your boyf's a Taurus    Make an effort to dress up for dates. These types have great style and appreciate u going to all that trouble. Don't rush ur crush either - he likes to take his time when kissing, eating or chatting. Be patient with him or you'll scare him off. Taurus boys are slow-moving sweeties 'n' he's worth the wait.

       Took a quiz in  urlLink msn.com , do I really need a man in my life? Well, I don't need it?! Do I? I love to be alone, but still I need someone who can take care of me. Hello ... that's normal rite? Who doesn't like their bf to stay by their side?! And yes, I love to hang out with friends...         My results              You don't feel you need one man, but you sure like men.      You love your girlfriends and they fulfill a real down-and-dirty, let-it-all-hang-out, wise-woman function in your life. However, you certainly appreciate men, and you understand that they have a different energy than women, an energy you'd like in your life.   You're charmed by the way guys drink beer from a bottle, wear 25-year-old paint-stained khakis, and talk about hockey as though it were important. You understand that you can have all this in your life without romance.   But sometimes you worry that you ought to settle down, and you're a little afraid of growing old alone. Are you afraid to get involved because you've been burned before?  Are you overly picky , still looking for Mr. Perfect? Do you fret that you'll eventually need someone to push your wheelchair?   At midlife, "Sometimes women think that love has to be 125 percent or really, really good," says psychotherapist Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz, author of The Confident Woman: How to Take Charge and Recharge Your Life (Three Rivers Press, 2001). "But the great thing about romance at midlife is that 80 percent is all right, if that's enough commitment for you. If your parents would disapprove of him, if he's from the wrong socioeconomic group, if he's not somebody you'd have kids with, if he won't get married or if you don't want to -- none of that matters. Enjoying the time you spend with him counts most. The enjoying part can be irrespective of age or profession, or any of the stereotypes of what a 'right' kind of man might be.   ____________________________________________________

       I wonder why I have so much times to update my blog, even on busy days! *sigh* Well, kind of a routine job to log on my blog everyday.     &nbsp;   I served few aunties today. They were here on Tuesday, came again today. Does this mean they are very keen in getting a unit? Hope so ... briefed & explained everything with&nbsp;them again. If they'll come back to me the third time, I'm pretty sure they'll buy at least one unit. Yay! They are all rich aunties come back from US ... sure they have lotsa  'spare money'  to invest ... haha!     &nbsp;   I'm occupied with activities everynite. Basically, I went out almost everynite since Monday. Last nite went movie with friends (King Arthur, wasn't really nice) & tonite I have a date with Oi Tze. It's been quite some time I have not talked to her, kind of miss her. I miss our time spent in Sunway. She always has many stories to tell, I enjoy listening to her stories &amp; craps. We like to make up story & make fun of ourselves. haha ... that was really hilarious!    McDonald has new recipe&nbsp;&nbsp;on its New Wave Menu&nbsp;&nbsp;--  McDonald's Crispy Prawn Burger and Prawn Wrappers!  Sounds really tasty. Hope to try it this weekend!     &nbsp;  Heard that this year's mega sales gonna last for 2 months. They've extended it & will have one grand sales season per year instead of 3 in a year. I'm so happy to hear that, I tot I'll miss this most happening events in KL this time, I purposely make my trip few days earlier to catch the mega sales. But looks like now&nbsp;I still have tons of chances to shop till my pocket lubang getting bigger & bigger! hahaha ...    &nbsp;

       Arghhh ...&nbsp; I'm so so so frustrated today. That stupid stinky in my office was talking crap for the entire morning. Guess what, he was sweating badly this morning, and yet he didn't take bath, he didn't even bother to get a tower to wipe up his stinky body. He just let it dry itself by sitting under the aircon. Imagine, the whole office was his smell! Damn shit ...     &nbsp;  Mr. Foo wasn't in good mood this morning, he scolded everyone of us in the meeting! Hmmm ... well, bosses are always like that, they don't know how difficult & how things work out, they only know how to complaint &amp; order people to do things that is very impossible. Guess what, he wants me to send 2 sets of sales kits to KL by courier & this is the add he has given me:   2 Sekolah Tunku, Bukit Tunku, Kuala Lumpur . &nbsp; Address without post code, without Jalan, without telephone number of recipient. How am&nbsp;I going to send this by courier? I've been trying very hard to seek for the proper add of this school,&nbsp;I even called up the  Ecucation Department  in KL for help. I doubt whether this school still&nbsp;exist or not! Well, I'm still trying ...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

I'm pretty surprise with the newly upgraded functions here. Great job, now I can change my font size &amp; color&nbsp;according to my mood (like what I did in LJ).   &nbsp;    Ever since&nbsp;I start working, I never go clubbing .. I'm so out with pubs and discos nowadays. I even don't know the toilet in Shanny has changed (right Denise? We&nbsp;were so&nbsp;darn blur that&nbsp;nite) hahaha ...

I know he will be more alright with it this time ... at least he is pretty much respect to my decision!  __________________________________________________  *I've made a lot of phone calls today!

        草香形象    你擁有非常堅強的意志，不依賴他人，給人獨來獨往的印象。你擁有旺盛的好奇心與豐富的感受性，是個過著知性生活的現代人。驟看下你是個自命清高，不好相處的人，但是一旦跟你交談後，就知道你很好相處，等到交情加深之後，就更知道你其實擁有很爽快的個性。  你所擁有的中性化魅力，讓你不論在男性團體或女性團體都大受歡迎，不過你不喜歡讓人看到你脆弱的一面。你外表上看來也許很冷靜，但實際上卻是熱情如火。  能夠知道你真正本性的人，才能夠跟你天長地久地交往下去!

       urlLink    Oh, sweet sensibility.    You're doing great! The retailers at your local shopping mall don't know you by name yet. You manage to keep those shopping urges at bay most of the time. You're good with money matters. Keep doing what you've been doing all along. In 5 years or so, you'll be well on your way with a healthy bank balance, 1.47 kids, and a nice Proton car to your name.

      Who the hell he thinks he is? Does he have the right to put my follow up details into his daily report? I understand the reason he is doing this, he wants to claim credits, he wants to let Mr. Foo & Dato' know that he is doing his job, he wants to show everyone that he is following up with this client & thus he can claim the commission. I don’t know what made up of his mind, only know how to claim credits & talk bad about others. Never think of ways to improve or upgrade himself. Suddenly I have the feeling of being cheated! I shouldn’t have given him the quota & promise to share my commission with him! I believe if that time he didn’t talk craps in front of Mr. Foo, he won’t get the commission, not to say the quota! Shit him ... Obviously, he was back-stabbing me in front of Mr. Foo. Now that I realised I shouldn't have made that stupid decision at that time. Damn depressed now, but what can I do?   He is so immature!   Seriously, I'm very unhappy to see his damn report today! duhhhhh .....

      如果20岁以下的爱情不是成熟，那么—— 　　二十八岁的女孩说：“我要找有房，有学位，有绿卡的三P老公。”是不是成熟？ 　　三十五岁的男人说：“我要找个有钱的太太，这样可少奋斗二十年！”是不是成熟？ 　　四十五岁的女人说：“我立刻找个男人，还来得及生个小孩。”是不是成熟？ 　　五十岁的男人说：“我一定要找一个比我小二十岁的少妻，免得没两年她就到了更年期。”是不是成熟？  每个年龄有每个年龄的爱,爱没有尊卑,没有贵贱,没有成熟与不成熟。人的一生能有多长,人的一生就能有多少爱！  ----  > by 柯蓝

      I was pretty busy throughout the entire morning, meeting with contractors & our project manager ... tired. Felix & James were quarelling over some small matters this morning. When they were quarelling, i was thinking is it practical & logical for me to share my half commission to him. My client has just paid the progress payment last week, should i share my commission with him while he is not doing anything at all, it was me who done all the follow ups with this client! I'm so reluct to give him half. Why me?!   Oh ya, Wah Kon came to visit me in my showroom yesterday. Thanks for the egg tart kon! I was trying to get Kon to buy one unit in Grace Garden ... haha! Given him all the brochures ...  errr ... I'm blank now. Will update more ...

      Went to watch Spiderman with a new friend last nite. Yes, new friend (Chee Yoong). He is actually my customer, in fact he wasn't interested in our properties but he is interested to call me out for a movie. muahahaha ... that's what i think! He doesn't have a good look, he is not tall (as short as kang jie) but he is nice & kind. hmmm ... that's all.   Alright, back to the show. Awww ... the show was awesome, love it. Peter Parker, the spiderman, he is cute! If all of u like the first one, u'll love this too, which consists of more actions and more flying. I like seeing him swinging from one building to another. Erm ... i'm not a good movie reviewer, can't describe more. People! Go watch the movie & find out yourself! *wink*

      Ouchhhh ... know what, I've never been that busy before during saturdays! Today is our Open House / Tea Reception organized by us together with Maybank. Although not many potentials turn up, but setting up with everything is the most tiring task to do. Starting up is always difficult! I was here quite early, rushed up everything before our invited guests come in at 11am. And ... I think I want to & I need to mention this over here ... Guys in my office are so damn "gentlement"! See my inverted comma, do I sound sarcastic here? Yes ... I am! These 2 guys in my office came in so late this morning & left all the hard works for 3 ladies here (somemore Karen is pregnant, what can she do?). Anyway, Felix came in at around 10:15am, he did give us a hand ... well, at least he did something. BUT ... the fatty stinky James was standing there with his two hands relaxing & seeing me handling with so many tasks at one time. He didn't even bother to give me a hand (this made me think of one of my friend, not to mention his name here, but those of u who know just keep quiet lar ... hehehe).   Ok, the party suppoed to end at 2pm but it dragged until 3 something. I'm so so so tired ... exhausted!

       I can't remember when is the last time I went swimming, should be ages (since I came back from KL). I went swimming in the Marina Club yesterday after work. My stamina getting worse ... the Marina pool pretty big (olympic size), feel so exhausted after finishing few laps! Guess what, I can't even swim more than 4 laps. I must train back my stamina. Oh ya ... I'm happy becoz I don't see my big tummmy on my swim suit anymore ... it means I have not wasted all my efforts, I must continue to keep myself away from tasty food ... keep it up *wink*!

      Feeling very indifferent these days. Told myself that I need to be aggressive &amp; realise what I'm going thru and then ... avoid myself from getting into too much troubles! Haven't been meeting him for days ... guess I should get use of this ...  I've been busy for the coming open house on this Saturday. And ... yes, I need to work until 6pm this Sat! Damn tired ... but then again ... i'll get replacement for that! *wink* Oh yeah ... we (property department) are forced to sell  Sutera Harbour membership  (at least 20 sales from us by 20 Aug). So, this Sat's open house will also stress on promoting the membership! We need to start inviting ppl to the showroom! Anyone is interested here?

Not much change, still maintaining the greatest 'Jay Chou's Style', which I really love it! 很多人都说他没有改变，但我却认为如果周董改了风格，我们就听不到真正的周氏音乐了。   专辑曲目：       我的地盘  七里香  籍口  外婆  将军  搁浅  乱舞春秋  困兽之斗  园游会  止战之殇   Basically all tracks are nice ... and ... I personally strongly recommend Track 2, 4, 9 &amp; 10!

      Since he is nagging around for not saying 'hi' to him in my blog! Alright, here it is  ... A big 'HI' to my dear dear brother in Australia ... how r u there? Err ... nothing much ... since we chat to each other everyday...  There were a group of Korean visiting our showroom this morning. They are really gorgeous. Especially those Korean girls, they are so pretty. They look really nice even they don't put on make-up. I really admirer their natural beauty...  I've been eating spicy food for 2 consecutive days. Had Nyonya food at Water Front (besides Cock & Bull Bar) on Tue night. Wanted to try this long time already, finally got to taste it's Kapitan Chicken (which was strongly recommended by Denise) ... *delicious*. Then ... last nite, we had Indian food in The Sutera Harbour Marina Club. Not bad ... quite special! We have this special cracker served with their unique gravy as starter. I personally like the taste of that gravy, it's like some kind of salad cream, but it's not salad, it has very special taste which stimulate my taste bud! Anyway, I never had so much spicy food in 2 days, guess I'll have to drink more 'liong cha' to 'calm' myself down ... LOL :-)

      Kang Jie bought lots of stuffs for me from UK. All branded stuffs, does he thinks that I'm such a  materialistic girl ?   urlLink     These are all the branded stuffs he bought for me!   Basically only the red & black T-shirt suits me. Well, actually I'm quite dissapointed with him, he doesn't even know what size I'm wearing, he doesn't know I don't like to wear sleeveless shirt, also ... he doesn't know white shirt doesn't look good on me! He is such a careless guy!!! That's why I hate him!   urlLink     Anyway, this Kookai Bag is considered good. I used it yesterday ...    And ...   urlLink     I like this me-to-you bear, he is soooo cute! Wonder if Steph still like me-to-you bear or not.  _________________________________  I went to Karambunai with CY yesterday afternoon. Supposed to get my camera there & take some pics ... but I didn't. Neways, he met my dad &amp; mum yesterday, I'm glad that he is pretty friendly with my parents. Sometimes I'm wondering why can't Kang Jie do this to my parents?! Well, fact is fact!
