      Hey. First new blog. God the funniest thing happened today. Kay.. Brit and I were walking to the mall, and my dad didn't know we were going. So we saw a white van (which is what my dad drives) and thought it could be him. All of a sudden some psycho guy in the van starts screaming " wooooooooooh hoooooooooooh " at us. It was so great. One week left of classes... 7 days until dance recital. so excited. Ah today was coolest we saw the hottest guy ever Greg Huck at the mall........... oh my god this kid is sooooooooo hot. We also went downtown. for absolutely no reason. Today was so great. later xoxo
