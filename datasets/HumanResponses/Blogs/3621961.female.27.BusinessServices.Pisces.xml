      I was laughing out loud  before my eyes meet your gaze which was steady less than 3 seconds ago. You looked elsewhere. Our conversation rerouted somewhere else.   Copyright 2000 by Serenity

      The sun is up and the bird shrieks on a bough Your eyes are open and you long to hurl  fiery words into my ears. Which you did. But all I could hear  is the bird. A train is coming  in the distant Metal grinds against metal outside our windows. You don’t hear all these things. Burned, I dive under cover.    Copyright 2003 by Serenity

      on the banks of the rivers of Babylon i sat down and wept for strange towns where we lived a year or two for the walk on the long wooden path to the river and woods for crumbling longhouses for the smell of dark swampy water for the lost of paternal love.  on the banks of the rivers of Babylon i sat down and wept for the call of the ocean for the coldness of trade winds for sands and stones beneath my feet for the lane where we held hands below the arch of branches for sunsets and fields.  on the banks of the rivers of Babylon i sat down and wept for our early morning shadows in rose-tinted rooms for our lost dreams of yesteryears for our playgrounds and games for our smiles and tears for us ceasing to be children overnight  for our age of innocence.

       for G   I was a caged lovebird in mahogany  gothic gazebo  with pointed arches  and elaborately detailed carving.   I used to have a mate  we were immured rainbows  green blue bodies  yellow gray markings  on head and tails,  red beaks.   He didn’t chirp much just sat staunchly  close to me  head touching mine  sometimes he’d stared  beyond me  far, far away.   Silently he took  flight one night  lit out to travel the world  I was asleep  came morning  he was gone.   I’d still tilted my head to one side  hoping to touch his  hoping he’d come back  to unlatch the door for me  to tell me why.   I never saw him again.   For three years another  lovebird would perch  occasionally outside my cage.   He too went away.   One afternoon on the fifth year I escaped.  Strong wind blew  the door open.  It turned out it  hadn’t been latched.  I never knew it back then.    Copyright 1997 by Serenity

      Spring is okay so far               we got engaged without             romantic proposals               just golden rings and             a three-decade-old red wine.               300 Euros poorer             we now have               sweet smelling walls             and not a washroom               with green tiles.             Dark patches of clouds               here and there             above our yard               but funny how grandma             was the only one drenched.               My self-esteem got washed              away too, but perhaps it will               turn up in Portugal or Parnu             in the summer I can’t   hardly wait.

      She takes a nap but the sun keeps on shining  and she’s paralyzed by the pain  in the back of her eyes’ sockets.  Rising up she reaches the small vase by her bed takes out trinkets of faith,  admires the soothing effect they give her.  Going down  she tries to weed the garden  where a huge hole of absence femininity lies.  She misses talking to him.  He lies somewhere in the quiet house.    When past things don’t get magnify a thousand times  their necks are not  s t r e t c h i n g.   Copyright 1998 by Serenity

       For David, Joseph, Judy and King   The warm hues on a late afternoon sky always brought me back to the days we spent by the ocean dreaming of making it big in the world, thinking real castles would replace our toys someday. Alone with birds and sky and water we wanted the ocean to keep layers of events and incidents and wash them away to other shores. Let them marred the color of moss on ships’ hulls or became keepsakes for strangers. Moments like these were always poignantly beautiful though we’d never really lived to see the beauty on creeping, reaching water barely touching our toes. Beauty laid on mysteries we created on so-called passages stretched under hills or on theories we theorized for weeks about rusty car frames. We jumped and swam unafraid of white jellyfish that opened and closed like umbrellas. We thought the rocks and sands here dated beyond Cenozoic and other ‘-oics’ and ‘-ans’ we couldn’t even pronounced.  Years later we’d climbed on different bandwagons that could, or did, or will lead us to the afterlife. The forgotten playgrounds were now manicured residences of difficult citizens. Perhaps different children throughout the years solved our mysteries and we ourselves were among the spirits and great ghosts that kept playing tricks on them on rocks and sands.

       For G. W. B   Schopenhauer kept on wondering how suffering that was not his own affected him only to be answered  by Chief Seattle that we all live in a web made of human strands. That whatever one does to the web one does to himself. But you,  one term man, is vain. You thought you weaved the web with your filthy fingers.  You thought you were God.  Drifting to the lush sanctuary in the children’s eyes, and listening to the breeze of their laughter, are enough reasons not to convert ourselves to your religion, one term man. Neither will they make us stood  idly by.   Copyright 2003 by Serenity

      Tell me the secret of your innocence that invokes raw emotion forgotten on the shelf with the rest of the toys.  Looking at you is to dust it all and to bring out again the shine that I thought      was forever faded.  In your eyes I drive to your green country   	fields         sunsets          	candor         orderliness  It is almost painful but to tear my eyes away  is to force myself to see  the harsh reality of living.

      In this room you inhaled  the essence of one hundred years    I saw you     I talked to you        I touched you  Exploring nebulous       depth          your actuality              soul                 YOU  Shadows danced  on the walls    This gift we held     to our       breasts    like a crying child      craves comfort       tears seeping         through threads           soaking   our skin and dried  In this room your eyes and  fingers swirled in colors your lung gasped for a corner to breath   Copyright 1999 by Serenity

      Since becoming a mother she always dreamed of a god leaping out of her computer screen. Always reassured herself  someone is on his way  to pluck the moon for her. Always thought of  the town’s idiot who got  swept of her feet to Caribbean.  When good moods allowed  she cycled downtown Main-Square shopping for fools lounging in track suits. She wore her heels and jewels all the time sounding like broken wind chimes when she turned in her sleep mistaken for church’s bells in her dream’s wedding.  A bundle of pink trousers, washed out blue shirt, frail and balding, clutching a phrasebook was what managed to make the great leap so far.   Copyright 2004 by Serenity

      you got to have him inside out outside in to feed your insatiable craving  in your vain hunger you reached                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           without touching moist palms sultry and warm crossed and uncrossed your legs sometimes to the point of  vomiting yourself clean  for you he has no boundaries just meandering in different plane beyond the rest of us you stared,  stared,  and stared trying to be a part of  bittersweet sacred communion, you flushed  and fluttered garden upon garden of roses tulips, grew in your heart at anecdote of whispers and kisses  you wanted to know about me. i’ll tell you one thing- i gave it away once. there is no more to be given.

      I don’t know where or when you said children are God  Perhaps on the afternoon  that little bulb  crushed  And you couldn’t  stop  staring  at nothing  Or maybe it was  the night you were given  Another bulb and never stop adoring it ever since   Copyright 2002 by Serenity

       Sitting in my room and the windowpanes     reflecting the colors of twilight  I forgot about my work, the weather,   everything. I happened to know      a few days ago you devoured   a plate of oysters in Green Parrot. It's been awhile since I last saw you.   I even forgot how you look like.  They were fragments of your memories  and I listened and imagined     your days selling roses on the street,   lived an idyllic existence. "It was a great way to live", you said.  A visit to your Uncle Henry's homestead    your dad's vine-stained machete.    Roasted rabbit and the split tooth  with blade you wielded savagely    against bogeymen and bad guys on   your backyard.  These were the days of the scar    on your upper lip.     We talked about these things    over coffee and I had nothing  much   to say except for occasional    nods and throat clearings.      Later you'd produced  several snapshots of a boy and a woman. "They're in my periodic table", you said.    It's been awhile. I tried to imagine you sitting across somebody    much like me over coffee. Your manner did not invite many questions.  I wished I could walk pass you as a   stranger on the street.  But you have unsaid things I long to hear unshared snapshots I want to see.   Copyright 2002 by Serenity

      Looking out of the window   watching unnamed things pass by   the air inside here has never     feels so good-     good even without any aid      just moving with comforting       rhythms of the humming machine        (sometimes tight horror grips         us upon seeing reflections          of accelerating vehicles).           We push unpleasantness            far deep             only to expect them resurface               again throughout the course                of the day.                For a moment we snub                  them out to continue with                  last night’s communion.                   I look at you.                    The year has already begun                      and this car is okay so far.   Copyright 2001 by Serenity

      I never saw him dance. But under those poorly lit lights that night I saw him jive Exuberantly Teeth flashing like reflectors on highways Hair everywhere Arms flailing like octopus’ tentacles.  Dancing after telling me between giggles here and there of crackhouses he’d visited with her on a vacation to Ontario.   Copyright 2000 by Serenity
