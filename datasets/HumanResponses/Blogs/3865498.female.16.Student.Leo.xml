      Ok, heres another past journal entry from my "real" journal...   Saturday, August 23rd, 2003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10:45pm   Today is a sad day. Max is leaving for college tomorrow. He has orientation from 9-11. Tonight was our last summernight together. The day didn't start off so good. I came home from Foss (I also found a dog leash in the backseat of the car...hmmmm....) and I wanted to spend most of the day out with Max. But as it turns out, Mom always has something up her sleeve. Tammy (Erickson) said I could try Boris today for my retest of the C2 rating (since I didn't pass the jumping on Onyx). And it could only be today. So that made things difficult. When I got home, I called Max and told him about Boris. He asked about a movie early afternoon, so I went downstairs to ask my parents, and they (of course) said no. I begged, I pleaded, I did everything to make them change their mind. So instead of going to the movies, we went mini-golfing instead. And Max wasn't very happy about that. So we didn't talk for the whole time we played. He was of course disappointed. He wanted to spend some quality alone time with me. I did too, but I worked out the best thing I could. He really has no clue how difficult it is to talk to my parents and compromise with them. He thinks he knows, but he has no idea. Both of my parents are mules. Anyways, after mini-golfing, he dropped me off at home so I could go ride 2 horses (Slick and Boris). I felt like sobbing cuz I didn't want this day to happen like this. After I rode Slick and Boris (Slick I took out for a leisurely trail ride and trotted for a couple of minutes; Boris I need help with he's sooo lazy!), I came home and got ready for Max's farewell gathering (he invited friends over and we had pizza and watched  John Q , sad movie with somewhat happy ending). When Max picked me up, he was back to being his loving self. He apologized for being a jackass earlier and asked if I liked my bday present (he bought me a silver chain bracelet with a small heart pendent, its really pretty and I love it). The gathering was a lot of fun. Its sad to see all my senior friends to go off and become college freshmen (ah to be a freshman again). Especially Max. After everyone left, we had 15 minutes to spare, so we went down to his bedroom and talked. I think I was ready to cry, and it looked like he was too, cuz when we were leaving we had to clean his glasses and wash his face. I'm going to really miss him. I guess thats an understatement. I won't be able to see him everday, to see him at school, for him to comfort me or vice versa. No more trips to Salernos or Mickey D's or Dunkin Donuts or even Michelle's house. No more driving along with windows fully down and Cold's "Suffocate" blaring. No more red Mazda Protege...its probably being killed as we speak... Though I did recieve its awesome CD player for my own car when I get one. God I miss him already. This is going to be tough. But I'll stick with it. We can do this, we can do this.     &nbsp;  Ahhh more memories, yes only memories those are... but they are good, good to remember and keep forever.     &nbsp;  *you know you love me*

      Actually, this is an exercpt from a  real  journal... my old one actually. I thought this would be a good one to blog, it sort of sounds like a college essay in parts, too bad I already wrote mine. Oh well, here it goes.      &nbsp;

       Sorry that I haven't written in awhile...things have become sort of hectic... ok not really, I just forgot about this... oops... anyways, sometimes some people get me soooo aggravated. Like B today, she expected me to be able to go over and watch a movie with her and LA and O. But I'm sorry, I wouldn't be ready in time to go over there and watch the whole movie before LA and O had to be picked up. My mom offered to drive LA and O home since LA can't drive O since she's not legal yet, but I guess my plan wasn't good enough. And I'm sorry, but if I am going to watch a movie, I'll want to see the whole thing. And now B is like pissed because she has less than two weeks here in our hometown before she goes off on a trip with her family... ok its 2 weeks, thats a long time, and packing doesn't take that long. There's 10 more nights that we can watch movies, tonight just wouldn't work out. I just can't believe she expected me to be able to...she like assumed... and if she gets really mad over this, then...I don't know, it'll be ridiculous. BAAAAHHHH! and LA asked even if I couldn't go over there, I'd still have time to hang with G, right? And I thought, oh thats nice of her to think of that, but when I was in the shower, it occured to me that B might have asked her to say that to see if I was ditching them or whatnot... but maybe I'm being paranoid... probably that. Ok I think dinner is close to being ready. Maybe will write later.    Love   ME

      So, tonight was a little party at L's house, because she's leaving for Alabama soon for a church mission. It was fun, we watched   Scotland, PA  . Its based on the book   Macbeth   by William Shakespeare, but its set in the '70s and its hilarious, I defintely recommend it to anyone. Anyways, I've already seen it, we watched in it English class, so me, L, and G have seen it, and nobody else has, so we wanted to spread the humor. anyways, so it was me and B on the couch, and G showed up, so then it was me, B, and G sitting comfortably on the couch, but then LD showed up and we squeezed her on the couch too...we all got very close, but it wasnt really awkward because we had spent so much time together recently. anyways, it was really funny because another one of our friends likes G, and was there and was watching us and giving us dirty looks the whole time we were fidgeting around and laughing and stuff. And we were telling inside jokes because we had just watched   The Shining   last night, and we were making Tony jokes and saying "redrum redrum" in a freaky voice...yeah...nobody else got it. But, I hate to say it, but I actually liked sitting that close to G... I don't know if I'm falling for him again...maybe its that I've never really stopped liking him, I mean he was my first "serious" boyfriend, and that relationship didn't end well. But I already wrote about this, duh. But I don't know, it sorta feels like he's feeling the same way, sometimes by the way he looks at me...am I crazy? Probably. I don't know if I should tell anyone this. If I do tell anyone this, it has to be LD... she listens better than anyone else. Yeah and I also have a problem with LL, we didn't end well either, but that was my fault. It was stupid of me to try to have a relationship with another guy so soon after breaking it off with my long term bf M. I thought I could, I thought I really liked LL...guess not. But I told him why I was feeling this way, and he knows everything about me, I thought he would understand, but he didn't. He started acting like an ass, and he was really bitter about the whole situation, but I guess I would be too... and he still flirts with me because he still likes me but I don't know if I should talk to him or whatever. G knows that he still likes me, and feels bad for him, a) because my last bf used him to get to me, and b) because of me, because I sorta dumped him in a flash... and I feel bad, but I'm not gonna trade in my feelings for a guy anymore, I did that too much with M. I think I've really given up on guys, but deep down I want a relationship, a good, strong, healthy relationship, but sometimes I feel like I can't make the commitment. I don't want to be tied down, I don't want to cry over a guy again. M really put me in the gutter, even though I was the one who dumped him. I want to be held again, I want to be kissed again, but I also know I hardly have time for a relationship or the energy. Having a good relationship takes up sooo much time, time that I could be studying or riding my horse or running or working out or playing with my dog. And its senior year coming up, I can't make any more mistakes for school, I gotta kick ass... but we'll see what happens. Maybe it would be better if I had a boyfriend that was the same age as I am...but then what happens at the end of senior year? We both go off to college...long distance relationships are tough too, talking on the phone doesn't always do it, especially if you spent so much time together. And I know where I want to go, I'm not gonna change my plans for a guy. Yeah...ahh...I can't wait for college, so much more freedom, and I won't have to worry about parents not approving of dating or anything. But another year of prison, another year of torture, but another year of fun, laughter, friends, and good times, especially since we all have our licenses and cars...fun times will continue! thats all for tonight, will write when I have another craving to get my thoughts down online... Love, ME

       Many things that I did not know before I now know. I sorta cant believe it all. Its all so reassuring, good to know. One, G was never mad at me for dating M so soon. Two, he was mad at M for being a dick, which means being himself. Three, G did like me when he broke up with me, it just wasnt working out because we couldn't drive. What I'm wondering now that since that has changed, whether his feelings are changed. Probably not. But the weird thing is that G hasn't dated anyone else since, or hasnt even caught on to liking someone. But its funny how we both have matured over that year and a half. we can talk to each other now, the conversation flows and the convos get deep. sort of. ive learned how to talk to people, im not so quiet and shut up anymore. i know how to flirt consciously, i know what sort of things can make a guy happy. it comes with having an 18 year old bf for a year and going far. G, well, havent really talked to him a lot in the past year or so. But i bet that if he had a girlfriend he would make the first move. I also think he would have no trouble talking to her, and I bet she would have no problem talking to him. its nice having him as a friend again. I remember him being easy to talk to at some points. But that easy? No, I think things have changed. We have matured. Amazing, isnt it? So many memories rush back to me. Lord of the Rings 1--we were alone, and boy was that awkward. I think thats when things began going downward. Oh well. The Brotherhood, Becca made us watch it. More awkward than comfortable, a lot more bad than good. Oh Spiderman. And really one of the good turning points of the relationship--bowling at the Bowladrome, the first time he put his arm around me, the day I thought there was a death wish on me b/c of that. Then the new years eve party at L's. Sitting on his lap b/c of no more room on the couch. Well at least now I know the correct way to sit on a guy's lap. Playing truth of dare--but never being able to act out the dare because I was too prudent, too nervous, too scared--suck on G's finger...oh how innocent we were sophomore year, how everything seemed so giant and scary. Sex was forbidden, kissing seemed unnatural, and boyfriends lasted approx. 2 months. Yes how young and innocent we were. Pure and naive, adolescent at its prime. But we are that no more. And we will never be like that again. but thats ok, getting older is a process of life, and kissing is quite fun, its too bad I haven't gotten one in almost 5 months. Maybe my luck will change, maybe kisses are just around the corner...Who knows, only we decide the future.                                                          Love, Me

        Isn't it funny How some people just keep coming back I thought this would never happen I thought it was completely impossible But look Almost an hour long conversation And friends we are again Ex-boyfriend was an ass Was the reason you gave for all that Tension Tension it was But tension no more But the problem is I don't think those feelings had ever completely gone away I was attached to you Attached to you like the moon and the earth Then you dropped me Dropped me like the non-existent gravitational forces on the moon And you floated away... True I got over you, He changed all that But friends with you I could not be But friends with you I can now be No more ass of a boyfriend No more BS coming from that mouth Now we have talked Things are good We now understand each other We now know The Truth.

       What do you see When you look at me? A girl With good looks? Whose confident with herself? A girl with morals and values? Or Do you see That same girl But she's wicked hot And, in your own opinion, That's much better Than a girl who's Intelligent, Caring. Do looks really run the world? Do they really decide who's hot  Or not? Can morals And values Count for something in life Or are they too old-school To matter anymore Please If you want me only for my looks You better walk away Because I won't stand for a man Who tells me I'm hot everyday When I'd rather hear "The beauty inside Means the most to me." But how could someone ever say that When they dont get close enough To even scratch the surface Of my inner beauty. Something must be wrong in the world. If what's inside Doesn't matter anymore But I know someday Someday! I will meet a man who sees the whole me Freckles, big nose, and all And love me for the whole me Not just the superficial me.

        I saw you today For the first time in almost 6 months I tried to run I tried to hide But like before You found me And asked me, "Hi. How are you?" And how could I answer you truthfully? How could you possibly understand? Yeah, I'm doing great, life is a peach But please Never talk to me again. How unfortunate we had to run into one another How unfortunate you chose to come up to me You know how we ended in tension You know the feelings between us So why did you chose to try to talk? Go ahead Talk to my friends But please Never talk to me again. How could you think I would answer you   sensibly? How could you think this would work? Bitch You call me Fuckhead I shoot right back What did you expect? A hug, a kiss, a warm "Oh how I miss you?"? Sorry But things did not end well between us So go ahead Call me a bitch But you'll never know my true feelings You'll never get into my heart again Don't worry You'll never have to yell at me again Don't worry You'll never have to fear my loyalty to you again So continue Entertain your "new junior" Show her (and from what I hear, sell her)  What makes the world go round Maybe show her your sweet and loving side The side that tricked me But never And I mean never Come to me again and call me a bitch I'm not your sweethear anymore I'm not even talking to you There's no point in labeling me And there's another plus You won't be called a fuckhead again Or at least by me.

       I feel bad about L. He's one of my best friends, and I have to say, I love him, but like a brother, not as a significant other. And thats tough for him, because I think (and so do others) that he's still hung up on me... so that makes things difficult. I watch over him like he's my brother, I make sure nothing happens to him or he does anything stupid. But again that makes things tough. I think he'll get over me soon enough... I hope. Anyways, G now knows what Max and I "did"... like bases and all. He was really surprised to hear we went to 3rd... He even said before, Oh did he steal 2nd? and I was like, well umm try one more base. L thinks that G wanted to be the first one to get to 2nd with me... well sorry honey too late, Max covered you on almost all the bases (no pun intended). Well I don't know what Greg was thinking, I mean I went out with a horny and very experienced 18 year old (when I was 16)... we were bound to round some bases in our relationship. And the weird thing now is that I'm more experienced one in the relationship-- G hasn't dated anyone since me the first time and we didn't do anything. So pretty much G is very clean, innocent and naive... too bad, it was always fun to be the less experienced... ha ha ha good times...   you know you love me

       So why does it matter if I don't smoke or drink? Why do I (and LA) have to be labeled as "good"... I don't see the point in being "bad". All I see are the effects of smoking (anything) and drinking (alcohol). Ok, drinking alcohol is only illegal for people under 21, but smoking pot is just plain illegal. So most people don't wait to be 21 to drink...oh well. But smoking, thats what I'm most against. I fear overdose, addiction, and accidents. I fear the daze, the confusion, the bad smell, and the bloodshot eyes. But most of all, I fear my present boyfriend turning into my previous one. To me, it could be simple for that to happen, and I don't want another relationship like the last one,  ever . I'm just confused. When did G change to wanting to be "bad"? Last time I checked, he was all good and that was fine by me. I mean, I've changed too so I shouldn't talk, but in the drinking/smoking way. As B said, I am way beyond my years when it comes to relationships. And I agree, Max and I went far, no doubt (but of course not all the way), and we went through a many fights and makeups. It did feel like a marriage at one point. And I finally realized, what's the point in being in a relationship like that? I'm only 16 years old! But that wasn't the only reason why I broke up with him. Max could be cruel. But then he could be so sweet. It was his way, I guess, of keeping me. But I soon realized that this wasn't like a normal high school relationship, so thats when I broke it off, and he was really upset, and mad. It was really hard, but it had to happen. Things just weren't looking good. So anyways where was I? Oh yeah. So I have experience which I didn't have the beginning of sophomore year, but I'm pretty sure G is pretty inexperienced, I don't think he's had a girlfriend since our last relationship. Oh yes, this is our second try at relationships. Its going better. Anyways, I don't drink or smoke. Huge turnoff. Whenever I think of either, I see Max's face with bloodshot eyes and he's dazed and confused. I also shiver and "disgusting" pops into my head. So, really, I hate both, which is bad for G.   well   you know you love me

        RUNNING          Running is a way of life. Once you start, you can't stop. Or at least for good. Once you feel your first "runner's high", your first pain where you thought you'd never hurt, you become masochistic. But its not always about how you feel, its about the people you meet and the friendships you make. Running becomes instilled in you, and you realize your legs, and your life, will never be the same.          If you do well, win races and achieve personal bests, that's one of the best feelings in the world. But no matter how well you do, it will always comes down to the fact that you love running. Well, I'll be more specific, I know I love running for my team. I love the camaraderie of my fellow runners and I love the support I receive from my teammates everyday. Track is the only sport where you have something in common with everyone-- you all run, you all feel pain, and, most importantly, you're all set out to do one thing: RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. It doesn't matter if you're a sprinter, a middie, or a distance runner, your goal for each race is to run faster than the previous one. A baseball or football player can't say a pitcher and a left-fielder or a quarterback and a right-tackle share a common goal. Sure they all want to win the most games they can, but that's everyone's goal, every sports team wants to win.          Most people hate to run. As my team says regularly, "Our sport is your sport's punishment". No one wants to run laps except us. No one gets excited about warming up around a field except us. But why do we do it? Why do we put our bodies through such a rigorous test of guts and stamina?          Its tough to say why though, and its even harder to explain to a non-runner. During any intense running, may that be racing or doing a speed workout, you start to feel numb. First its your quads, then your lower legs, then your arms, and soon your whole body is tingling in over-exertion. But even how painful this might be, you run on, to prove to yourself, or even to others, that you are not going to give up, you are not a quitter. The weaknesses start to show, your form loses all correctness, but you flail your arms and you pump your legs just so you can reach the finish line and say to yourself, "I know I can do better". Which is true, amazingly, because it doesn't matter if you feel like you're going to drop dead when you immediately stop running. You know five, ten minutes later your breathing will be back to normal and your legs will feel fatigued, but you can still walk and even cool down. So you wait till the next race when you can try to beat your only true enemy-- yourself.          That is a runner at its best, when quitting is never an option and improving is only twenty-four two-hundreds or five tempo miles away. All runners know this feeling, all runners know deep down they're not giving it all they have. Now the question I have for you: Is it in  you ?
