       Arg. Frustrated that im doing this, but sometimes i just need to speak my mind, and i dont seem to have any friends close enough to do this to (which is the reason for frustration). It's annoying not having any best friends, or even (it seems) any close friends, and only a few "friends". The rest are just schoolmates, and are too busy being with thier best friends to have time to be friends with me. I dont know, it may just be me, well, i guess it is me. Unless things change, i will be posting here more often. Don't mean to offend, just getting things off my chest, so to speak...

       now, i dont particularly consider myself a religious man, but i thank the lord that we didnt go to australia a week ago. im not going to dwell on the events that occured today (very personal stuff, even if u ask im not gunna say anything), but if me mum and i had left the country, my grandmother would've been in a bad situation today by herself. its funny, you think her breaking her arm and the drama that followed would be the end of the world so to speak, but it turned out to be somewhat of a lifesaver. the world works in mysterious ways...  ugh, my life only seems to be filled with bad luck. apart from today, i cant remember the last time i got any good luck, and calling today good luck is a horrible excuse, cause only bad things have happened. maybe things will start looking up when i go to college, that is if i get some good luck to get into a college i want to go to.  so it turns out we're gunna ditch the grandma, and we're leaving on saturday for australia. this IS final. she's just gunna have to deal with it, we're having people come and check up on her every week or two. leaving on july 3rd and arriving on july 5th means we "skip" a day due to the whole international date line thing. this is the second time now that i've "skipped" the 4th of july. there's a  Fact Of The Day  if i ever saw one.  was reading stephanies blog about the whole embarresment stuff, and personally i couldn't agree more. i have had so many embaressing moments in my life, and i have definately learned from them what to do and not to do. if only you could learn, and then turn back time and do it differently...  anyway, still NOTHIN HAPPENING IN TULSA... p.s. if you want me to bring anything back for you from australia leave me a note, and ill try to get on it. so far i have to get a live kangaroo, a live wombat, and some throw downs.

       ...my grandmother comes and slaps me in the face. good god, im soo mad i could kill her. every inch in my body hates to say that, but thats the way i feel right now. Want to know why? Well, here's how the story begins...  okay, so my grandmother (the one im living with currently) has this really annoying tendency to go psycho in the weeks leading up to whenever one of us (mum or I) leaves for australia. she either:  a) forgets to take her medicine b) forgets what medicine she is taking c) takes the wrong medicine and gets deathly sick d) falls at church and bruises herself e) falls in her own house and bruises herself  now this is a woman who  GOES TO THE GYM TWICE A WEEK .  SHE IS 84 YEARS OLD AND STILL GOES TO THE GYM  how she manages to fall and injure herself is a bit suspect. that, and the fact that she has never fallen and hurt herself at any other point other than the weeks leading up to when we leave.  now, during the first weekend of june, both me mum and i were out of town, and supposedly my grandmother fell in the house and did some damage to her back. however, she failed to let us know, and my mum only figured out when my grandma was talking to one of her friends on the phone and mentioned it. so we took her to the doctor, and everything seemed to be fine. come this recent wednesday, she complains of pain in her side, says that she has fallen again at church, and scheduled a catscan for tomorrow at 3:30 (our flight would leave at 3 for australia). she thought she could keep us here with that, but mum and i still decided to go.  today, while playing golf, i get a call from mum saying while we were both gone, g'ma fell on her wrist and broke it, and that she has to get a cast tomorrow, and it has to be on there for 6 weeks. this leads to us having to cancell the trip, forced to watch over her 24/7 because she cant handle us leaving for 7 fucking weeks. i mean, come on, ive been living with her for 10 months now, and she cant let us have a vacation. this is bullshit. she is hard enough to deal with when i dont mind her around, but when i cant stand to even look at her, i know she is going to bug me every ten minutes until i end up going insane. i rarely get mad, but this is probably the maddest i have  EVER  been in my entire life. she does not respect me, she treats me like i know nothing, and when i try to have a serious conversation with her, she laughs in my face. and she flat out lies to my face as well. it is pissing me off. man i need to let off some steam. cmon people lets do something over the summer if im going to stay in this boring town. if not, i  WILL  go insane. man, i need a drink...

       hmmm...checked me SAT scores online today. got a 1300. not thrilled, but it'll do for my first attempt, im definately gunna take the SAT at least one more time. i was surprised that i didnt do as well on the math as i thought i did. in case you were wondering, the SAT is stupid btw.  nothing much been happening for me lately, and thanks to me mum spraining her ankle in two places, ive been babysitter to my mother for the past couple of days, including me working with her at miller swim school. that was deja vu, it had been 5 years since i had been there, but it was basically the same except all new teachers. it got me thinking about the middle school days. man, those  were  the days. thinking about the songs that went with middle school. man limp biscut it old.  so im leaving in four days to australia. hopefully ill be able to do something with my friends before i leave, otherwise im gunna be leaving on a bad note. im really exciting to be going back, but it looks like we're gunna be moving cities when i arrive. great just what i need,  another  move. id say ive moved at the very least 20 times. 19 times too many if you ask me. as well im sick of going to diferent schools. including this hh visit as a separate school, ive been to 8 different schools. 7 different schools in 14 years is not a good idea for all you future parents out there. anyway, im sorta getting off on a tangent here...  im getting pumped up for dodgeball tomorrow, that is, playing dodgeball at the Y. hopefully there will be a bunch of people there, and it'll be a good time. at least it'll be better than sitting at the house doing nothing. anyway im off to bed, peace.

       man, i really didnt like the ACT. apart from running out of time on the last 2 sections (reading and science), i thought the reading was difficult as it seemed to do more with opinion than anything else. i thought it was kinda hard to describe the opinions and views of the author based on the articles. apart from that, i thought it was actually easier than the SAT. oh well, nothing i can do about it now o_O  btw GO PISTONS! i hope the lakers lose and die. all of them. in a big plane accident.  saw shrek 2 today and riddick on friday. i thought shrek was much better than riddick. the gingerbread man was awesome, as was the cute  look puss in boots gave (awwww). id say it was about equal to the original, but there were a lot more movie references in the sequal. riddick was mediocre. it was sorta cheesy and confusing, but im sure it would've been better if i had seen pitch black. i found the ending sorta abrupt as well.  otherwise nothing much happening. thankfully i haven't had any dramas. looking forward to dodgeball next friday =D. later, peace.

       well, its been a couple days since my last entry. theme has been tana screwing me over...that kid owes me big is all i have to say. at least ali found out about the card game, hah serves you right. but really, much   got my grades today. i dont mean to brag (well actually, i do) but i got all A's on my finals. im really, really happy bout that. now all i have to worry about is AP Physics, and i wont find out until i get back in august :P , along with the SAT and ACT scores. hopefully ill do ok.  also i got my senior photos back yesterday. i think they turned out really well, i had them taken at philbrook, and the weather was overcast so there wern't any problems with the sun or the temperature. i got plenty of wallets (plus 48 free for doing it so early) so ask for some so i dont get stuck with 60 wallets of myself (im not that egotistical).  otherwise not much else happening. played tennis today in sweltering heat (the most ive sweated in a year) and as a result i have a pounding headache, so im gunna go lay down. peace.

       well, i just got back from the lake, and im extremely tired. i had a good time, it was my first time to go to the lake, ever, and it was good just hanging out with friends. i think everyone was beaten up in some way, and im taking the night off to recover.  i guess i haven't updated in a while. i took the SAT on saturday for the first time. im confident about the math, just the verbal may have kicked my ass, we shall see. it'd be nice if i got better than a 1250 at least, i only want to have to take it twice if i get a score im happy with. the night before was tana's bday, went to see mr. potter in action. it was my first time with anything harry potter, and i actually enjoyed the movie. i forced myself to rent the first 2 to keep up with the story, it'd be nice if i had the time and the patience to read the books, cause im sure they're a lot better than the movies.  saturday night was....interesting. first time i'd thrown up after drinking too much. it was too much too quick i think, and i learned a lesson the hard way. wasn't exactly what i had in mind before getting up early and driving for an hour and a half, but i made do. otherwise this weekend was quite bust and hectic. looking to relax this week, and i should probably get reading my summer books soon, as i leave for down under in 2 weeks from tomorrow. starting to get excited! anyway im off to lay down and relax my aching body. later.

       So i watched the seniors graduate tonight (emphasis on watch, i didnt go but instead watched it live via the internet), and while it was boring during most parts, there were some good moments. I was extremely glad they initiated Mr. Ballard as an official headmaster, he really did bring a lot to the school, and i wish he could stay on as headmaster. But alas, all good things have to end. Im sorta glad i didnt go, as i would imagine i wouldve gotten a bit squirmish due to the length of the speeches. Funny thing, when the one lady (wasnt paying attention aenough to remember her name) mentioned something about same sex marriage or gay and lesbian marriage, the camera immediately went to Mark Kharas for the one and only time during the graduation. Funny how that works... Also, what was the deal with Tiffany?!?! i looked away for a moment, and then the crowd started cheering like crazy. Can someone plz fill me in.  Otherwise, ive been relaxing and studying lately. not much drama. the next few days should be busy though. A happy birthday to Stephanie and Dunn today, best wishes, and Tana's b'day is tomorrow. man, its so nice not having school :D

       Funny story, a cat has been showing up in our front yard and has been "living" there for the past six days. Gradually my mum and grandma have been buying more and more cat things (food, then litter, then taking it to the vet) and now he has been givin the tour of the house. Apparently, he (named Max Cat) is our cat now. my mum has been the biggest supporter of having a cat, and ironically she is leaving the country (tentitavely for good) in 3 weeks. im a bit iffy on the subject, but hopefully it will work out and keep my grandmother busy and less concerned with me...  Oh well, cats are fun to have around, i just hope my grandma can remember to take care of it so it wont be me constantly doing everything. this SAT is annoying, and i  have  to study for it if i plan on doing better than a 1210 (SAT equiv. of my PSAT score), so i best be off...

       Thinking is the devil. I have concluded this statement from experience. Thinking only seems to frustrate me, and i do it often, too much in fact. It seems that when im out with my schoolmates, im having a good time and not "getting frustrated" or "thinking too much" or even thinking at all. When im not out with my schoolmates, however, i start thinking about  why  im not, which if you ask me, is really,  really , annoying. Therefore, thinking is the devil.  i hate to rag on people (mainly because i hate people that rag on other people), so i normally keep it to myself. however im going to flush out my mind and speak my fury. It is frustrating when you hear stories where people call up their friends for a gathering, and then tell them to keep mum about it as to not invite the entire school over (that is how Holland Hall works, unfortunately). although im fine with that, it is annoying when you consider the person who is calling his/her mates your friend, and you end up not recieving a phone call, but then hear about the gathering from another person that had been notified. I realize there is nothing personal involved, but man, is it frustrating. these type of incidents throw me into thought, and have me questioning the authenticity of my "friends" once again, which i hate to do. the cycle never ends...  ah well, such is life. if you've read through my entire rant, i give you props. if you happen to recognize the "story" above, please dont hate me, i just need some release. now im off to study for the SAT of doom this sat-ur-day.   P.S. thanks for the words of advice stephanie. ur blog was the inspiration for mine ^_^

       Gday everyone! long time no talk. finally able to get onto the internet for a bit, been unpacking things in the new house we moved into here in australia. been unpacking for a good 2 weeks now and we still havent finished...  anyway, its good to be back. been watching non-stop footy and rugby, and all the great aussie shows ive been missing for the past year. makes me not want to return to the states o_O but alas, i shall return in 11 days. too soon if u ask me. been catching up with me mates over the past couple weekends. good to see em, but they werent as close as the guys from Holland Hall were (and still are i guess). see all of em made me realize how much i enjoy Holland Hall and the people that go to school there. a lot of the people the go to Nudgee are a bunch of blockheads looking for a fight. didnt really fit in to well, as im not exactly one to go looking for a fight.  well, ive read one summer reading book, and i have 3 more to read and a paper to writer in less than a month. to put it lightly, im screwed :( ud think the rush on time would make want to hurry up and get started on it. youd be wrong.  although it has been a tad bit boring here, ive most of my days unpacking, and i did get to go to an amusement park with the tallest and fastest roller coaster&nbsp;in the world. wondering how everything is in Tulsa, and if tana's party went according to plan. im really beginning to get excited about senior year, because i have a feeling it is going to be so much fun. anyway, im off to bed here (its around midnight) so ill se you pooftas lata ( ;) to anyone who understood that) peace
