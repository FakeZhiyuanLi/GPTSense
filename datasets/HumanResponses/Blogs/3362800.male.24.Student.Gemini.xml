      Today, there was a nation wide event being held in Singapore. The New Paper Big walk.I went for it,just to have fun and try for the experience. The event started at 730 am.However,for us who woke up at 530am and waiting for the bus to MRT station, we were frustrated.We WASTED an hour just to wait for the bus!!!  Without any choices,we called a cab to go to Kallang,the place that the event was being held.It's really shocking when i saw the amount of people walking and squeezing around. The doors, the paths are too small for the amount of people.It's really uncomfort to squeeze with people and i HATE it..Somebody started to climb over the fences and of course,this dangerous act cause someone injured.I am not sure whether the gal's face did scratch or not but I really pity of her.  The event last for few hours,and someone went back home with the Nissan Sunny 1.6.Not me...haiz..Today really not my day,I wake up early but can't get the bus.When i went home after the event, I realized that my bunch of keys was lost!!Stress, and frustrated are the feeling I went thru today.  Ha...Finally,the weekend is over.I really scared of being too free.When i was free,I keep thinking of somebody,my loved one.But,I can't get her because her hp was lost.This make me even frustrated.Anyway,better day will come.Hoped so..

      Just finished the lengthy and inefficient JCRC meeting.Today,the committee members celebrated my birthday together with other committee members whose birthday fall in May.  Feel so happy to have friends around.After the meeting,my world turns quiet again.During the time,I was thinking of my loved one....feeling sad.guilty and ashamed to face her and her family members.  Planed to call my loved one's parents tonight.Hoped to get their excuse for being irrespect to them...  Suddenly,felt that heavy metal is a very nice music for the person like me.Who always feel lonely and unsecured .....  Heard from my friend that there's a quite dangerous job, need to climb to 5 level height building with only stand on an I beam.. However, the salary is good. I still hoped that I cna work for it after my graduation.  No matter how tough, I wish to work for the few years and earn my capital for the future.   Hoped that,as my birthday wish, my life will never alone in the future...   Dated 22th May 2004 6.06 PM Lonely Man

      Today is the longest working day in my life.Already 7.45pm but I still cannot go home.Something need to be verified immediately.   Feel so happy to have friends that really can work together and have fun together.  Although I am already 24, but, I am still hungry in learning new things.Learn to be mature and treat a gal well.  My hope, always is to get my dream gal as my galfren.I did something wrong and I'll always feel guilty. Never forget about the lesson.  I love my darling,forever.Although she might not want to be my galfren anymore.But, I will never forget her.I will try my best to give her my best.   Hoped that everything is fine....

      Life is full of hurdles. Sometimes, I thought that I am strong,I can live without anyone beside me,but now, I felt that i am wrong.   These few days, I can't really get back myself from the sad mood. I thought I can, but I still always think of my loved one.I am struggling now.  Days are long,Everyday during the bedtime, i miss her voice,miss it a lot.  Anyway, now i just hoped that, I can be stronger soon... Time goes by,hoped that we can be very closed.At least, I know, she is still beside me and I can hear her voice.. But still,I really hoped to be couple....   Days are longggg.....

      It's holiday again.But not mine. My holiday will only starts from 27th June. It's still a long time to go.Sometimes, I felt that is very boring to repeating doing the same stuff everyday.Days are dull, trying to find a moment to rest and taste a cool breeze.. at Pulau Perhentian, or Pulau Redang, but, definitely, not Pulau Singapura!!!  3 years on this Pulau has changed me a lot.From a nerd,to become more nerdy..=P.Everyone told me that it's very stress to study in singapore.I also felt so, but no more.. Nowadays ,the thing that i am most concern is,when can i go back to my hometown and relax..  Malaysia,still is the best place for my for my future....   Dated  1.20 pm  17th May 2004
