      Does this mean CIA considers India a serious threat to its foreign policy? Was missing spy Rabinder a CIA mole in RAW?  IANS[ WEDNESDAY, JUNE 09, 2004 10:59:16 AM ]   NEW DELHI: A senior officer of the country's most-secretive intelligence agency has reportedly defected to the US, causing a major embarrassment to the government and casting a shadow on New Delhi's ties with Washington.  Joint Secretary Rabinder Singh of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) has since been sacked, apparently after fleeing to the US via Nepal.   If the story is true, he is the highest-ranking Indian intelligence officer to defect, making him a Kim Philby of sorts - the India-born British super spy who, London shockingly discovered, was all along a KGB mole.  The RAW, founded in 1968, is India's equivalent of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and responsible for espionage abroad. It has its share of successes and setbacks, and is talked about only in whispers.   But in neighbouring countries, particularly in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, there has been a sense of awe about RAW. Officially, and for diplomatic reasons, the government has denied the Rabinder Singh episode, but the intelligence community is excited. There is concern about the damage Rabinder Singh has inflicted on RAW.   Some officers believe that although Rabinder Singh had no access to material of high sensitivity, he managed to photocopy many secret documents and obtain other information from some of his colleagues. This apparently had been going on for years, and it is not very clear when he came under suspicion - and how.   Some reports say he came into notice after the CIA station chief in New Delhi inadvertently dropped his name during a conversation with RAW officials during a routine meeting. Others assert it was not so, and that suspicion fell on him as he began raising questions within the agency he had no business to ask.   According to one account, the counter-intelligence unit of RAW confronted him April 19 - shortly after he returned from the US - and accused him of removing "sensitive files" from RAW headquarters in south Delhi. On May 4, a report went up to RAW bosses saying Rabinder Singh, whose wife and other family members lived in the US, had bank accounts in Singapore, Brunei and the US and that he should be arrested.   Just what happened then is wrapped in mystery.   Newspaper accounts indicate Rabinder Singh was put under surveillance, and RAW officers began to build a watertight case against him. His phones were tapped. While this high drama was on, the general elections in India threw up a stunning verdict on May 13, ousting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.   The next day, it seems, Rabinder Singh disappeared - just how and where to no one has been able to coherently explain. Most RAW officers believe he managed to elude everyone and go over to neighbouring Nepal. There, his US handlers are said to have taken charge of him.     "From what has appeared in newspapers and magazines, it is more a case of dreadful embarrassment than anything else," said Ashok Raina, author of Inside RAW", the only book on the agency.   "It is unlikely he had access to information that would be really useful to anybody," Raina told IANS. "It is also very interesting that his recruiters did not make any attempt to protect his identity or preserve him as a long term asset."   A US embassy official said blandly: "We don't comment on such matters."   Officials admit that the case is bound to affect Indo-US ties, particularly it is highly embarrassing for a government that a supposedly friendly ntelligence agency was trying to undermine RAW. It is not the first time that RAW - which has grown from a agency of just 250 agents to almost 10,000 in over three decades - has suffered enemies ithin.   In one earlier case a RAW officer was jailed after being accused of spying for CIA. The CIA trapped him with the help of an American stewardess, using he sex route. He too was eventually sacked from service. But if Rabinder Singh is indeed what he was - a high-ranking American spy in RAW - how did he escape attention so long?   "This is not surprising," said Raina. "In both MI5 and CIA there have been major moles for a long time. Even in KGB."

      At the end of it all, two questions are asked by the Sikhs of Punjab. Was the Army action necessary and unavoidable? Secondly, if unavoidable, could it not have taken a different form, avoiding all the destruction and the blood shed and the brutalities ?   Kirpal Singh, President of Khalsa Dewan, Amritsar, told us - "If the government had been sincere in its efforts in solving the Punjab problem, it would have solved it long ago even before the Blue Star Operation, and there would have been no cause for the Akalis and others to orgainise Morchas of the thousands of the peopl, from time to time, and the extremists would have been isolated and it would have become known as to who were the extremists, what kind of men they were, and what they had been doing. The Government could have negotiated with them. If the Government could talk with Laldenga of Mizos and extremists of the Nagaland, who had been fighting with our military for the last 31 years, then what was the difficulty in talking to the extemi sts of Punjab and asking them what they wanted, what they were fighting and why they were collecting arms?"   Similarly, S.S. Bhagowalia who is the Vice-President of the Association fro Protection of Democratic Rights (Punjab) was extememly forthright, "when the government in 1948 could control and capture Hyderbad from the Nizam who wanted to secede from independent India without any violence and killing of the common people, why this Government could not capture Bhindranwale with tact, without any damage to the Golden Temple? This has created tension and anger amongst the minds fo the people". Surinder Singh Ragi gave another example - "The Indian Army had captued 93,000 soldiers of Pakistan army in Bangladesh in 1971 without bloodshed. Was bloodshed the absolutely necessary at the Golden Temple to flush out a hundred or so terrorists?"   Hazara Singh Vadale, and employee of the SGPC, echoed a common sentiment. "The way the government of Independent country attacked the Golden Temple reminded us of the medieval time when our religion was attacked and we are persecuted. Thousands of women, children, pilgrims, had gathered here on June 3 for Gurupurab. They had no connection with politics, why they shot down?"   Kirpal Singh elaborating on the excesses committed said: "At the time of Blue Star Act, it could be known how many died of those who were fighting with the military but the fact is that due to Guru Purb Day hundereds of pilgrims had come and were staying in the premises of the Darbar Sahib. There were children and women among them. These pilgrims were unarmed and the military attacked them and killed them. Thereafter the military did not allow their dead bodies to be cremated by the relative nor h anded over the same to them. Their dead bodies were insulted. No effort was made to record their names and addresses. Now it has created a lot of problem. For example, if any deceased has any insurance or bank balance or any land dispute, his heirs require death certificate but in absence of any record of it, they did not get any compensation. Even in the history of military wars, the people are allowed to take the dead bodies from each others territories by showing white flags. When General Dyer killed people in Jallianwall Bagh, he also allowed the dead bodies to be taken by the relatives."   Shiv Singh Khushpuri, 65 years, a member of the S.G.P.C. from Gurdaspur district, said, "It was the duty of the State to identify the bodies of those who died in Operation Blue Star. Afer the Jallinwala Bagh massacre, the British Government identi fied those killed, handed over their bodies to the next kin and paid Rs. 2000 as compensation for every person killed in the incident. Whereas in Blue Star Operation, the present governemnt of an apparently independent country have not only not identified those killed or missing, rather they are harassing and persecuting the families and friends of those who are reportedly missing."   S.S. Bhagowailia throws light on the efforts of the Government to suppress information. "The doctors who conducted the post-mortem of the victims of the army action at Golden Temple were simply terrorised. If there were 20 bullets in a body, they were forced to record only two bullet wounds, under the threat of being shot." This only indicates the extent of massacre that took place and the ferocity with which the Army undertook the operation. The common feeling in Punjab is that it was indeed not an Operation against Bhindranwale and other so called terrorists according to the Government, it was an attack on the Sikhs "to teach them a lesson" so that they would never again raise their head or voice of protest.

      The Cambridge Spies    KGB Headquartes, Moscow (Corbis)   The dark, windowless room in KGB Headquarters held nothing more than a chair, rows and rows of file cabinets, and a long table. If the room had had a window, in the near distance the walls of the Kremlin could have been seen, ablaze with lights. The newly appointed officer sat at the table while a filing clerk piled file upon file upon it. As he went through the dossiers, the KGB official was astonished. Here was the history of four agents who had penetrated the highest reaches of the British intelligence establishment. Everything that Churchill or Roosevelt or Truman had thought had been reported to the Soviets as soon as the three great statesmen had uttered these thoughts. The files were clearly marked: "Transmission to Control, to Beria, to Stalin." No bureaucracy was to impede the flow of information from these spies. They were too important, their information too reliable. The KGB man smiled. KGB men rarely smiled.  The four were not characters in a spy novel. The KGB official was not an invention of a writer of fiction. They were real. The spies were Burgess, Blunt, Maclean, and Philby.  There have been no more successful, more dramatically impressive spies than a group of Englishmen who all met at Trinity College, Cambridge University in the 1930s. To one degree or another, they were active for the Soviet Union for over thirty years. They were the most efficient espionage agents against American and British interests of any collection of spies in the Twentieth Century. One of them, Kim Philby, served the KGB for almost fifty years.  All four were eventually exposed but --- amazingly --- never caught. One, Burgess, was a flamboyant, alcoholic homosexual. The second, Blunt, was a discrete homosexual who rose to knighthood as the Royal Curator of Art. The third, Maclean, was a tense, insecure diplomat of ambiguous sexual persuasion. The fourth, Philby --- and perhaps the most intriguing of the group --- was a dedicated heterosexual who has been called, not inaccurately, the "Spy of the Century."  Great spies are more interesting in fact than in fiction, more fascinating in reality than in the legends that grow up around them. It is easy to forget that successful spies, by their treachery, are some of the most adept of killers. Their murder victims are faceless, usually never seen by the agents who send them, unwittingly, to their deaths.  "Today, of course, it is well known that Harold Adrian Russell Philby was a Soviet agent within MI-6, a traitor to his own country and a man who betrayed many of the most important secrets of the Western democracies to the Soviet Union. Now Kim Philby is a legend --- a demon or an antihero, depending on one's philosophical bent. Philby himself, or a thinly disguised fictional counterpart, stalks through many modern spy novels."  --- Robert J. Lamphere, FBI Special Agent, 1986  No novel by John LeCarre, Ian Fleming, or Graham Greene can capture the brilliance of this group of Englishmen. No James Bond film, with all of its gadgets and action, can capture the drama of the Cambridge spies.      The Cambridge Four:  Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess (1910-1963), BBC broadcaster, agent in MI6, secretary to Deputy Foreign Minister, Hector McNeil, British Foreign Office secretary, London, Washington  Anthony F. Blunt (1907-1983), tutor of French, art historian, art adviser to Queen Elizabeth, agent in MI5 during World War Two, "The Fourth Man"  Donald Maclean (1915-1983), Foreign Office secretary, Paris, Washington, Cairo, London  Harold Adrian Russell ("Kim") Philby (1912-1988), journalist, agent in MI6, "The Third Man"  The Intelligence Organizations:  MI5, the British Office of Counter Intelligence (the equivalent of some of the responsibilities of the American FBI)  MI6, the British Secret Intelligence Service, sometimes referred to as the SIS (the equivalent of the American CIA)  KGB, the Russian Secret Intelligence Service, (formerly the NKVD)  Other principal players:  John Cairncross, Foreign Office secretary, private secretary to Lord Hankey, Secretary for Security, sometimes referred to as "The Fifth Man"  Arnold Deutsch, KGB controller for the Cambridge Four and John Cairncross, 1933-1938  Robert J. Lamphere, FBI, Soviet section  Yuri Modin, KGB controller for the Cambridge Four and John Cairncross, 1947-1953  James Skardon, MI5, interrogator  Michael Straight, American State Department employee

      Does this mean CIA considers India a serious threat to its foreign policy? - For those who need an intro to Kim Philby do see the next post.  Was missing spy Rabinder a CIA mole in RAW?
