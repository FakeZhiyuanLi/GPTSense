       I'm having busy days. A bad experience with .net and I was wondering, how am I going to fix my website? Well for newcomers, I already have a complete flash website. I’ve uploaded it 2 days ago & marketed it. SMS, Mail, Instant Messages, Chat Room advertising everything I’ve done to tell the world that I was online. It was a good experience. My mood was pregnant. It is like buying a home in downtown New York or Sunset Boulevard. lol even Upstate New York is not a bad idea.    I was dying to see my guest book & No. of visitors. The first one to sign in was my dear bro. Heramb .. Well he is a nice guy. Always funny … yet somber at times but even that solemnity has a tinge of laughter in it. Whenever I watch Will Smith , I find Heramb so much reminiscent of him .. lol like I did , yesterday, when I was watching MIB II on HBO. He was online that night and provided me with good hints n tips regarding my website. Well he was kinda busy wid damsels …. I know it’s high time for him to get some one … (hope His parents r not reading this:P)   The one comment I was keenly waiting for was of Ashutosh. Now He is my dear bro. too but exactly opposite of me. A Very Shy Guy , as he loves to call himself , skinny , always wearing the naïve specs of intelligence. As expected he sent me a long mail very next day with heapz of tips n tricks. It was a good mail to read. He diagnosed the website’s present condition well & presented new ideas. I replied him immediately expressing my joy for an apt reply & thanking him for his program (which hotmail deleted cuz an .exe file as an attachment is considered as a potential threat.)   Before him, I met a good friend of mine. Anu, as I call her wid love, I met her few months down the line in chat rooms n sent her summer of 69 song in Mail :P … Since then I never chatted wid her in Private Messages. As the juggernaut of time rolled, we met again tht night. I’ven’t seen her in person, but I can sense her Suave nature & Sprightly presence around. I guess u don’t have to meet people to know them, Its something inside that ticks. Or else peepz live together for number of yrs n feel astonished every now n then bout their partners. The best thing : SHE LOVES GAMING LIKE ME. I Dunno, How good she is in CS (Counter Strike) as she proclaims. Let me have a game wid her someday... n let me see who get the most FRAGS.   Back to the 31’st may …. I was thinking the whole day bout nature of my website. I had a very crude, rookie design online. My main intention was to put up a website for game programmers, loaded wid tuts n games. Some sections for vb/vc programmers and discussion forums should be handy.   To be frank, I was happy when I designed my flash based website. Later I found it very spiteful. A failed attempt of a Greenhorn as u call or a Neophyte (Thanks to Barron’s :P). Suddenly I found myself visualizing bout the website more and more.   I needed a sleek, super sleek design wid minimum of mess n loadz n loadz of useful links & tutorials.  I will definitely have some flash part in it. Huh tha’s the best way to show ur knowledge bout the damn thing. As a hard ass perfectionist I’m, I believe certain things in life represent U. 1> Your resume 2> Your matrimonial Ad and 3> Your website. If you have spelling mistakes, disorganized content, perplexed design then it shows negligence on ur part & not the finesse you want to depict.

      Arete, Sophrosyne, Sumpsimus, Serpiginous, Gaminerie and Autochthonous  Can anyone guess meaning of these words: O …..? Lol... forget about meaning. How about spelling them correctly in Single chance … in front of a big audience in Grand Hyatt Washington. Hats off to you. If you’ve guessed it. No … I ain’t talking about GRE and TOEFL and BARRONS or CAPLAN Tests. This is National Spelling Bee 2004. The winner was David Tidmarsh, a 14 yr old Indiana boy. David, an eighth-grader at the public Edison Intermediate Center in South Bend, won the top-prize package of $12,000 and an engraved cup from the bee, plus an additional $5,000, encyclopedias, a $1,000 savings bond and a reference library from other sponsors  Whoa … Nothing get bigger than this. I was flipping channels ,trying to find out some value based entertainment. Discovery was showing the re runs. National Geographic was a passé. Suddenly I saw this competition on ESPN 2. I couldn’t resist myself. I put aside all the work I was doing (lol How bout David J. Kruglinksi’s Inside VC++). My eyes were glued to idiot box (Very often I find myself in this situation if Baywatch is not playing or Swimsuit illustrated Pageants are not showing).   I was loosing it totally … Couldn’t spell better than them. At the end when David hide his face behind his placard then I found myself standing and clapping with the same enthusiasm as David’s mother.   These contests are amazing. Intel science fair or National Spelling Bee or Any other talent exams…. It shapes up your mind, character. It strengthens you to face any challenge, overcome any adversity. Talk about prizes, name, and fame … It’s a serious Addiction …  Let me tell you Addiction of fame is the dangerous amongst all types of addiction. You start to feel more n more hungry or thirsty for that share of limelight …. The worst situation to be in than any Man Eater Leopard/Tiger.  I know it better than many of my peers. Once you reach to such plateau it is very hard to come down or thinking of descending. Once you’ve been there for years and years then it is very hard to fathom the defeats, it is callous to accept the failures.  But every trough has a crest to follow and vice versa. That’s why life is interesting and it is not monotonous.   I wouldn’t ever trade my multidimensional (add dimension of time also) life to any other dull, monotonous, droning lifestyle. I think to feel the zephyrs of success whirling around you & then face the calmness, coldness of failures and carrying the torch of hope to find that warmth shanty of success is the essence of life. Mansions of successful lives are built upon the foundation of failures and sagacity and erudition derived from them.

       For last 4 days I was frantically waiting for something to happen. Related to my life or at least related to my website. It was true – my first dig at personal website creation was terrible than a neophyte’s practice work. A Bad design in Flash was the culprit.  I wanted to put everything in my website. Programming articles, Game designing tutorials, Several Links & Hundreds of utilities … My present website wasn’t even accommodating my info. On 5’th night, I was searching for good layouts for my website n suddenly Voila! I found one. It was a sleek, sophisticated online curriculum vitae layout by Ubooty (A company based in Norfolk,UK). By the way it was free.  I downloaded it enthusiastically and created my home page with minimal efforts. This time by hopes were centered on Flash’s elder brother Macromedia Dreamweaver. What a Name !!! Dream Weaver. Hats off to them.  As I was going strong & creating my web pages at a speed of nauts, I confronted a IceBerg straight ahead. The web page layout by UBooty Had a complete table in a web page & all components arranged in different table cells & rows. So if u want to delete extra components & resize the table -> IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE … It resulted in Long web pages even when the content was merely 2 lines long …..  I tried relentlessly, only to find wall straight ahead n a head bang ….  I was getting frustrated … Never ever I was so much annoyed with myself… Damn it... I thought … It was a simple web page … and I used to deal with Goliaths of C++, Visual C++ and .Net. I shut down my computer & relaxed on my bed. Deciding to forget everything bout that website.  I couldn’t concentrate anywhere else. Not even my favourite Yahoo Chat … Where I love to play All Star Counselor. Self Proclaimed Shrink. I’m chatting for last 6 yrs now & I’ve seen all kinda peepz here. Straight forward, Backstabbers, weak hearted, Wicked, Timid, Brash, Liars, Candid but there is a line of similarity which passes through all of them. They all need A Life Saving Support System.  Chatting is an addiction like any other addiction. When you get weak, When u loose control over ur life, When situation overpowers u, When you pass the reigns in the hands of Destiny n decide to enjoy bumpy ride in the back seat ……. You need someone, something, some way somewhere to rekindle past or Just to tickle yourself with the past without accepting the present tense hence trying to be someone who could have looked like/behaved like/been like this one in the past galore of glories.  Chatting gives you the same satisfaction. Freedom of being someone you are not, you were, you want to be, you always wanted to be or someone you never can be. It answers an impeding question, why do peepz visit Dance Bars or such filthy places. There for a piece of currency, they can enjoy the pre-eminence.  Power, Control, Freedom … Addictions give you everything for those split seconds ….  Maybe Life is like a Carrot hanging in front of a donkey... Like u n me ... So we run in the Great Optimistic mood in the Hope of catching the carrot which furthers with every step.  My website creation lead me to the point where I felt I couldn’t do anything to improve my situation. Suddenly, a thought kissed my cerebrum. I’ve done so many things before & toyed with all these tools. Why can’t I do this again?  I studied the whole layout again. Understanding the base concept... I created my own web page using layout’s graphics. WOW … It was piece of cake then :P  It was already morning of 6’th June.  Yesterday’s French Open Ladies Final was a Drag. Two inexperienced players playing in historic grand finale for the first time n one awed  by the situation, second one in the same seat but holding both the handles. Thank God , It ended. Anyways, Congrats to the Anastasia Myskina. Well Now her name is taken from Russian domain. She looks like a Mink though.   I started developing my website rapidly. My information, scorpio graphics .. all were in place. I wanted a big page for all links section which I placed categorically. Linkin those hundreds of websites was a neck breaking task, still I managed it. Due to sheer anticipation of website completion & a Gentleman named Mr. Ralf Luve.  If you know Mr. Ralf Luve, congrats. Let us draw some inspiration from this german. He works as a Systems Administrator in an Internet Service company in Germany. He is 32 yrs old. He is married and HE HOLDS 5 GUINESS RECORDS !!! Huh .. Lemme tell u bout his latest one … Have you ever heard the term “ Rubic Cube”? Imagine solving it in 5 minutes … What? Simple? Piece of Cake? Rookie’s Delight? … Well How bout solving it in 5 minutes … BLINDFOLDED …HA HA HA …. See tha’s the gr8 thing bout him. He did it. Gosh … I was spellbound, enthralled,  awestruck, agape ….. everything at the same time … Mebbe I won’t act such even wid Ms. Pamela Anderson Live In Person n Naked ….  Talk bout Mind over Matter & this guy was amazing. It proved Mr. Albert Einstien right, who used to use 40% of his brain. We are better than any super computer. Only we should know ourselves.  Remember the Dialogue from THE MATRIX ->    Don’t think you are… Know you are … !!!     It pushed me & finally I was able to finish my website. Still one last glitch was waiting. Counter on my main page. As I moved my site from yahoo’s geocities (provides 25 mb) to 125mb(provides exactly same 125 mb), my counter was gone. It was important to me in a sense of contentment. I searched again n again … found several free counters … registered with them .. result -> A counter with an ad. Again I was looking towards the window of melancholy. But as I was already stirred by Mr. Ralf’s otherworldly record, I decided to write my own counter. Which I precisely did with the help of My favourite Microsoft’s website. Tha’s why I’m an Ardent Fan of Microsoft.   Long Live Microsoft.

       Despair, Depression, Desolation, Dereliction, Delinquency …… I was suffering from all of them at the same time, in different forms.   I looked out & saw the glistening Full Moon above. It was clear in my mind. I ought to feel like that way. It was on of those days of the month again …   Full Moon day & No Moon day .. are so close to my life. If I found myself solemn than required & mulling over everything again n again …. It’s gotta be those days in month. I’m not lunatic. I’m not ruled by any extraterrestrial creatures. Though I’ve faith in the God & supernatural powers, I’m skeptical enough not to take things on their face value.   After all I’m in technology field where everything happens due to something or everything has a valid reason. Everything is causal in this world. Well not everything…. I’m a bit psychic. All Scorpions are …. By the way no marks for guessing .. I’m a scorpion … On the border of Libra and Scorpion but I identify myself more with a true good Scorpio with it’s The Eagle variety (Read Sun Signs: Linda Goodman).   But I know the exact point when this process of thinking n getting poignant was triggered. It was the conversation with my lovely friend, Anu, over 3 hours and 39 minutes. She is the exemplary whacko, punk, care free, unabashed teenybopper. The best part is she knows how she is n why she is. Well we all were in our teenage. To know that precisely is the best part bout her.   I still remember the time when I was in 10’Th or in 11’Th or in 12’Th. The world was outright black or white to me. Nowadays the world certainly is not a rainbow but smeared, blurred, smudged combination of everything.   Morales are something yesteryear’s people used to care for (n how foolish they were)… Value is something only currency notes have. Virtue is the word somewhere in dictionary.  Why different games like Soccer, Rugby, Boxing, Tennis, and Cricket are interesting? Because they all are played with certain RULES. Or else , a night club brawl, a street fight, a riot can be considered as various forms of those games. Same way …  Life is interestingly worth when it is bound by some rules. Nowadays the only rule is to break the rule or bend it.I ain’t acting like a moral inspector or an eighty yr. old guy who has seen enough n enough scenes.  Suddenly everything you are not supposed to do are means of enjoying life. Everywhere I go , I get the same answer … I want to enjoy my life… I want to experience everything in my life once …. Huh... Hail... Lame excuses for smoking, boozing, doping … lol do I say something bout SEX??? (Scorpions are not supposed to say anything against SEX)  Forget bout Conversation with Anu, she has to experience so many things. Consider my good old friend Sanjay, who is at least 10 yrs elder to me. I hear the same lines in the same tone every time … then may be it is in bar or a pub or at any other damn place. I keep on smiling to them n for myself … Cuz nowadays I’m being seen as someone who is the biggest fool alive … goodness gracious reason : I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. I don’t dope and I’m always the only one to drive all of my friends home when they are intoxicated above all permissible levels.  Life is getting fast & instant … So I’ve decided to write blog once in 2-3 days & decided to stop for today.
