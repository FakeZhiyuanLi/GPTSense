      YOU KNOW CHARLES MURRAY'S NEW BOOK,  urlLink Human Accomplishment , where he attempts to rank all the important humans from 800 BC to 1950? I was just dreaming that I was trying to write the sequel, ranking the important humans from 1950 to today. I was trying to figure out where to place the author of "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" in relation to the inventor of the Swiffer Wet Jet. Note to  urlLink VH1 : if you're ever doing "I Love the Nuclear Age", gimme a call.

      SCORE SETTLING: DUMBASS AT HFIENBERG.COM  Two summers ago, when I was hard at work in the bowels of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy (ok, I was just an intern at  urlLink The American Enterprise ) I wrote a piece for the website called "The Good News About Terror" (apparently no longer on the site). The basic gist was that America is actually much better equipped to fight and prevent terrorist attacks than a lot of people believe, with the fact that there hadn't been a successful terror attack in the US since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks as evidence. If I recall correctly, I mostly talked about how the since-forgotten hubbub about how the FBI had leads on some of the hijackers but that the information didn't get to the right people etc. etc. (remember Colleen Rowley?) was actually a good thing, because it meant that even in pre-9/11 America, when we weren't looking for terrorists all that hard, we nearly caught them, so logically in post-9/11 America, when we are looking,  hard , we should stand a better chance of foiling their plans.  My article provoked exactly one response:  urlLink some guy over at hfienberg.com called me a dumbass.   Basically his argument was that the shooting at the LAX El Al ticket counter was an act of terrorism, and it took place after 9/11, ergo my argument didn't hold water and, moreover, I was a dumbass. At the time, I declined to respond, because I figured I'd say something dumb and angry and embarrass my employer, AEI. But they don't employ me anymore. And now I have a blog of mine own.  Let me say basically that I agree with Fienberg that the LAX attack was terrorism, if not by Al Qaeda than at least by someone sympathetic to it. I actually think the same is probably true of the DC area snipers (though this may be disproved at trial). That having been said, I still think my basic point, that Al Qaeda's ability to hit the US isn't as great as we feared after 9/11, stands up. After 9/11, I at least was expecting all kinds of crazy shit - more plane hijackings, an outbreak of smallpox, bombings at major US landmarks. None of which happened. We can argue about why: was Al Qaeda less dangerous then we feared? were we better at fighting them? is there a host of archangels battling at our side? But the fact remains: there hasn't been a major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. How is that made irrelevant by the fact that a disgruntled cabbie shot up a ticket counter at LAX?    I now consider my score with that dumbass at hfienberg.com officially settled, a year and a half later. Best served cold, indeed.

      IF THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE RESULT, WHY EVEN TRY? That, I have to admit, is what I'm thinking about the second season of Joe Millionaire. I firmly believe the first time around was an unqualified success. I think, in fact, that it was the highest achievement of the early-21st century "find-your-soulmate" genre of reality TV. "The Bachelor" may have done it first, and "Married By America" may have been the most outlandish, but Joe will always be the best. The first Joe had three big things going for it. It had a brilliant, original premise. It was perfectly cast. And it was brilliantly edited. (This third point was the real secret of the show's success. The producers led the audience around by the nose, but always barely perceptively.  We were set up to root for the eventual winner, Zora, from the first episode, without knowing, until the very end, what was happening. We were made to subconsciously anticipate events, but nevertheless to be blown away consciously when they actually happened.)  In the second season, much of what initially worked in the original Joe is gone. The premise, still clever, obviously isn't original anymore. We know what happens when Joe reveals he doesn't actually have a fortune. We saw it last winter. Might the woman he chooses this time react differently? Sure. If we did the show 150 times, using control groups and statistical sampling to get the proper makeup of Joes and women, might we get useful statistical data as to how women in these situations react? I suppose. But who cares? This isn't science; it's TV. Show me something new or move along. (How's  that  for the jaded product of a media-saturated era.)   The editing's not great either, but that's not the real problem. The real problem is casting. Who are these European chicks. Allow me to describe who I remember from tonight's episode: the black woman from Berlin. the Italian woman with the faux-Hindu dot on her forehead. the really hot Czech. the kinda-horsey/kinda-hot German blonde. the Swedish "freelance fashion designer" (which I interpret as a euphemism for "unemployed"). Notice that I'm not using their names? That's because I don't know their names. I know them only by vague physical description.   Contrast that to the original Joe. After one episode, you could easily distinguish: Zora, MoJo, Heidi. By episode two, you knew Sarah, Melissa M., the incomparable Alison, plus a whole host of women who weren't even coming back. They were all individuals, weird characters, distinct and distinguishable. The Euros all seem alike to me; all equally over-tanned, ditzy, catty, overtly gold-digging in a way the Americans never allowed themselves to be. Which is to say: they're all Heidi, in different bodies. And Heidi was fun to watch, for a while. But I can't watch a show of 12 Heidis chasing after one Joe. (who is himself much less well cast than Evan, the original Joe. David's too aww-shucks dumb. Evan had a kind of down-to-earth-yet-arrogant dumbness that really worked with the premise)   Maybe I'll give it one more week. After all, he brought back the hot Czech. But if it doesn't improve, I'll leave it behind, and pretend it never happened. It's not like I don't have other things to be doing on a Monday night: I'm a law student, for Christ's sake. But I'll always have that magical moment when Evan and Sarah went off into the woods to (SLURP!)**(GULP!) No crappy sequel can EVER take that away from me. Ever.

      EDITING MISTAKES: NEVER FUN.  urlLink The New Republic's virtual primary has amended one of its entries  due to an "editing mistake" in the initial posting. The nature of that "editing mistake"? I can't remember the text verbatim, but I believe the entry began with the sentence: "John Kerry is a liar."  TNR's really swinging for the fences in terms of foot-in-mouthisms these days, ain't it? I guess this goes to show, though, that having an editor is not a foolproof prophylactic against posting dumb things on the internet. Which is, I suppose, a small comparative victory for bloggerdom.

      I WAS ON THE CONDI-FOR-VEEP BANDWAGON BEFORE CONDI WAS COOL (which is to say, the summer of 2002). And I basically agree with  urlLink this Greg Burch character  as to why it would be a good idea.  Except that I'm not sure a Bush-Rice ticket would do much better with African-American voters than the Bush-Cheney ticket did. I think  urlLink the fracas over Judge Janice Rogers Brown's proposed appointment to the DC Circuit  is a sign that African-Americans, or at least their political elite, don't see the race of an candidate as a trumps-all factor, at least not when it comes to African-American Republicans. And, though I can't remember any specific instances right now, I'm pretty confident that the same people tarring Judge Brown aren't exactly big fans of Condi, either.  I do think, however, that Condi's presence on the ticket would help the GOP, though mostly with moderate Whites rather than African-Americans. Having a black woman on the ticket makes the Republicans at least  look  more moderate, and - given where Rice apparently stands on many issues - may  actually  make them moderate. Basically, I think the prospect of putting the first woman and first African-American in the top two in one fell swoop will be enough to put at least some fence-sitting moderate voters into the GOP column.  Plus, she's kinda cute. Go Condi, ya....

      AND THEN THERE WAS BOONE. Our favorite "power hitter" was the one to make the first official error of the game. It turns out it was only his 5th of the postseason, so I suppose I was being unfair in my last post.  Now field your damn position!

      THE ANSWER: IT'S BERNIE! Before the game, my brother and I were wagering as to which Yankee would make the first critical defensive miscue. Would it be Jason Giambi, playing first base for the first time in a month? How about the always shaky Alfonso Soriano? Or the usually sharp "power hitter" Aaron Boone, who's somehow managed to make a half-dozen errors this postseason, including one Sunday night that cost "future 300-game winner" Andy Pettitte a complete game shut-out?  How about d) none of the above. Bernie Williams misplays a high fly ball to shallow center to allow Juan Pierre a leadoff double. And now he just scored on a Miguel Cabrera single. grrrrrrrrrr....

      AND THEN, THERE'S  SKIN . Here's a trivia question: what do Ron Silver and Angus Dwyer have in common? Both have played the role of the father of  Skin 's Olivia Wilde.

I played her father-figure, Sir Peter Teazle, and she Maria, my ward, in a production of Sheridan's  The School for Scandal  when we were both at Andover in the late 1990s. And she wasn't Olivia Wilde then, she was Olivia... well, she had a less Hollywood name, and one that would certainly elicit titters if I were to write it here. But I'm decorous, and a gentleman, so I won't.  But the point is: I knew her! and she's really hot! Does this count for nothing?!?

      FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INCONSEQUENTIAL FACTS DEPARTMENT: due to an odd architectural quirk, my apartment has two entirely separate climatic zones. One, encompassing my bedroom, my roommate's bedroom, the kitchen and the living room, would be best described as "temperate". The other, consisting of the bathroom and the pantry, would fall somewhere on the "subtropical-to-tropical". Apparently, the heating vents in those rooms are on some kind of heating-duct steroids. This is insane. Last night I walked into the pantry and - God as my witness - there was a lemur trying to steal my Ritz crackers. A damn lemur.

      ON THE OTHER HAND, THE SOLOMON AMENDMENT isn't exactly the Department of Defense's finest hour. The Amendment forces a difficult choice on law schools like Yale. They can  swallow their principles with regard to non-discrimination in hiring, and let a group that discriminates against homosexuals recruit on campus. They can forgo federal funding, including significant amounts that go to areas in the university totally unrelated to the law school, like medical and scientific research. Or they can confront the government head-on. That isn't an enviable position to be in. Surely the government must have some very compelling reason to force this difficult choice upon the country's law schools.   Well, I'm not sure. The ostensible reason, I suppose, is that the government wants to recruit JAG officers from schools like Yale, but hasn't been able to. And it thinks the problem is structural: that there's a latent body of potential JAG officers there, who could be tapped if only the government could recruit on campus like any other firm. Which is a sensible rationale, except that it bears no discernible relationship to reality. Does anyone really think that Yale Law students aren't joining the JAG corps because they have to walk all of six blocks to get to the Orange St. recruiting station? Couldn't the fact that they can earn truckloads of money in the corporate world or with big firms have something to do with it? Or that those who can resist the draw of becoming a legal Croessus still have a wealth of prestigious non-JAG options: the legal academy, Capitol Hill, not-for-profit work for swanky causes like fighting the death penalty, etc.? Ultimately, even if the government wins, won't it just have won the right to waste its time trying to recruit people who have no interest in joining the Judge Advocate General corps?  But, of course, I think there's another reason the government's putting Yale and other like schools in such a bind over this issue: it's trying to show it's tougher. That Yale Law School can't push around the Department of Defense. Indeed, that the DoD can push around Yale Law School. Who cares that on-campus recruiting will almost certainly yield no fruit; who cares that the small number of students interested in the JAG as a potential career that actually exists (myself included) can easily explore that possibility through other means; who cares that by forcing itself on Yale Law the government has made life difficult for a lot of good people here, and turned a number of otherwise law-abiding students and professors into potential law breakers (albeit of a rather modest sort)? The DoD has the  legal right  to be there, and no frou-frou law school, apparently, is going to stand in its way.  Maybe there'll come a day when students at the country's top law schools consider working as a military lawyer to be as viable and fulfilling a career as any. Hell, I hope I live to see that day. But that day coming is going to require a real cultural shift in how America's educational elite relate to the military. And I can't fathom how having a couple of JAG recruiters force their way onto campus against the will of an overwhelming majority of students and faculty is going to bring that cultural shift any closer.

      THE VOLOKH CONSPIRACY has  urlLink a nice summary  of the sane argument against my own law school's current suit against the Department of Defense over the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. I basically agree with Professor Volokh on this one. This issue came up once or twice last spring, when I was trying to enlist in the army (at which I failed, because - like my father before me - I was determined to be physically unfit for service). Yeah, the policy's both wrong and dumb. But it's not as if the army's primarily in the business of discriminating against gays; I seem to recall something about providing for the national defense in there.... These guys have a job that's both difficult and supremely important, and it seems to me we civilians ought to do what we can to help them, even if it sometimes means compromising our beliefs about what sort of hiring practices are or are not appropriate.

Why is this guy still getting the ball to start postseason games?

I mean, we're talking about a team that has difficulty turning traditional 6-4-3 and 4-6-3 double plays, but has somehow managed to turn, four? five? "strike 'em out, throw 'em out" DPs in the past 9 games. I guess just so long as Soriano doesn't actually have to throw the ball...

      FETISHISM AND THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT  This story  begs a question: could Congress impose a nationwide ban on bondage and domination fetishism under its Thirteenth Amendment powers? After all, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress' power doesn't just extend to forbidding slavery itself, but also includes banning "badges of servitude". Perhaps the voluntary participation of the parties is the key. But then again, no one (except maybe the most hard-core libertarian) would suggest that Congress couldn't forbid a person to sell themselves into slavery, even voluntarily.

      SATURDAY EVENING QUARTERBACK That was a painful  loss  today. Harvard was the better team, especially their linemen. Harvard's QB Fitzpatrick had all the time in the world when he dropped back. He got enough reads to finish  Moby Dick . The wonderfully named Eli QB  urlLink Alvin Cown , on the other hand, was under intense pressure the whole game, and it showed. Never let anyone tell you that linemen aren't important. dey iz.  The most frustrating part was that, even though they were outmatched by the Crimson at most positions, the Elis  could have won the game , if only Coach Jack Siedlecki hadn't come down with a bad case of world-historical-bad-play-calling-itis. Yale was stopped on the goal line two separate times.  Both times, it seemed like there was no plan beyond the next play -  always a disastrous idea. First time: six-odd minutes in the first half, Yale down 10-3. First and goal on the three. Run up the middle. Run up the middle. Draw play. So: it's fourth-and-goal on about the two. What do you do? You go for it! If you score, you tie the game. If you don't, you've pinned the opposing team deep in their own territory, with enough time left that a little good D can get you the ball back before the half with decent field position. What does Siedlecki call for? The gimme field goal. Yale pulls within four. But Harvard gets a great runback on the kickoff, and turns their good field position into a drive up the field for another touchdown. And, of course, the Crimson never look back.   So, it's the third quarter. The score is 24-13 Harvard. Yale is in the red zone again. Run right. Run left. Incomplete pass. It's fourth and goal on the four-ish. What do you do? You kick the field goal! Pull to within eight, and pray your defense can hold up. Harvard had been killing Yale in short yardage situations all day. What on earth made Siedlecki have faith that his team could convert on fourth-and-four, but not fourth-and-one? Why are you going into panic mode in the mid third quarter, when you're still within two scores? But of course not. Instead, Cowan throws an incomplete pass. And Yale never really challenges again.    Look: I don't pretend to be  a football expert , or anything. But it seems to me pretty obvious that you should take chances in the first half, and in the fourth quarter if you're trailing and have to.   Is there any way one of the  FireRonZook.com  people wants to come up to New Haven to help us out? I mean: why should the Gators have all the fun?

      COUNTERFACTUAL HISTORY IS A PET INTEREST OF MINE, so part of me is glad to see it  urlLink making an appearance  in a mainstream journal like the  Times . But most of me is peeved at the low quality of the counterfactual here. I'll give Hamilton credit for admitting that "counterfactual history is not only an inexact science, it is quackery." Of course even the best counterfactuals have zero predictive power; the world's far too complex for even the smartest of us to accurately predict what would have happened if, say, JFK hadn't been assassinated. But quality counterfactual history is two things: plausible and non-self-contradictory. Hamilton's work fails on both accounts.  The standards of plausibility are pretty relaxed here, since by definition the best argument I can make is "my fake history is much more likely than your fake history." I think you can hold these fake histories to a higher standard with regard to consistency, though, and that's where Hamilton's piece really falls apart. A mini-fisking:  1. In his JFK-not-assassinated world, Hamilton repeated has civil rights legislation fail during the 1961-1969 Kennedy administration. That's plausible, since some combination of the martyred president's memory and President Johnson's arm-twisting in the Senate were probably the  sine qua non  of the passage of the Civil Rights Act. But what's crazy is that, he has Martin Luther King, Jr. being appointed to the vice presidency (LBJ dies of a heart attack shortly after he's elected and vice president RFK becomes the new POTUS, creating a vacancy in the #2 spot) three years after the Civil Rights Act is voted down a second time. Does it seem even remotely plausible that a Congress that wouldn't vote for civil rights legislation would nonetheless install in office a black vice president?  2. George H.W. Bush is Reagan's running mate  in 1972.  That doesn't make any sense. Reagan in '72 is plausible. He was governor of California, a national figure who could possibly have been swept into office by a massive backlash by whites against a Supreme Court-ordered busing plan. But Poppy Bush? Where was he in '72? In our world, he was ambassador to the United Nations, a former Representative, and a twice-failed Senate candidate. Not exactly the stuff that vice presidencies are made of. And in Hamilton's world, he'd probably be even less than that, since it's unlikely that President Robert Kennedy would have named George Bush as his UN ambassador. So H.W. is what, then? The Representative from the 7th District of Connecticut? The president of Zapata Oil?  This is a good example of the "real events" problem that can plague counterfactual history. It would seem intuitively right that bringing in more real-world details into your counterfactual would make it more plausible. Hence the importation of Reagan-Bush from our world. The problem is that if you don't do it right, the imported facts don't fit, and it makes the whole project look weird.     There are a bunch of other problems with the piece, and I could go on for hours, but a) that's boring, and b) I need to get back to work. ["On a Friday night?" Yes, on a Friday night. Damn you, brief-writing assignments!] So adieu for now, sweet blogosphere...

      A HYPOTHETICAL OF MINE OWN Yesterday Jacob Levy of the Volokh Conspiracy posed as a hypothetical question:  Would a state law denying marriage to infertile heterosexual couples be constitutional?  He's gotten  some good responses , and I'm not sure I have anything insightful to add. But I will pose a hypothetical of my own: would it be constitutional for a state to abolish civil marriage altogether, for all groups?

      I'LL ADMIT IT: I THINK SOCCER SUCKS. But even I can't help but be touched by  this story.  I know large parts of Iraq are in a large way a total shit-show right now, but it's worth remembering a) that large swathes of the country are in fact returning to normalcy, and b) just how fucked up a country Iraq was only nine months ago.   Memo to  MLS : after signing  urlLink Freddy Adu , the best thing you can do to increase your sport's popularity is to send an all-star team over to Iraq to play against these guys. Hype it up bigtime, broadcast it on network TV in primetime (maybe made difficult because of the time difference), have Paul Bremer and the Iraqi Governing Council put in an appearance at the game. Nothing deadly serious or anything - no 1980 "miracle on ice" overtones - but just some friendly competition between us and the Iraqis. And since the Iraqis would probably win, it'd probably help ease the humiliation of how badly we handed them their asses last spring. This is a potentially huge PR coup, for the Provisional Authority in Iraq and for MLS in the United States.   (link via  Instapundit )

      WHAT HAVE MASSHOLES WROUGHT? Charlie Pierce makes an interesting claim in today's  Sports Nut  over at Slate. He basically says that the 1986 cocaine-overdose death of Boston Celtics draftee Len Bias was the Gulf of Tonkin incident of the War on Drugs. The money graph:   The tragedy was put to immediate use by a bipartisan passel [sic] of opportunistic hysterics led by then-Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, who demanded a tough new law to placate the angry and mournful Celtics fans among his constituents. ... That October, President Ronald Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which was sort of the drug war's Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and which visited upon ourselves a whole number of really fine ideas, including the mandatory minimum sentences so beloved these days by so many judges.   Now, I'm too young to remember either the death of Len Bias or the Gulf of Tonkin incident, so I can't really comment on the quality of this analogy. I'm curious to hear what any of my more senior readers (which is to say: my dad) think of this. If it's a valid comparison, though, it will only be one more piece of evidence towards my general theory that Boston sports fans are a force for evil in the world.

      "LOOK UP! LOOK UP!" No, the Angel hasn't come to Prior Walter. Rather it's me, encouraging you to look at my blog's slightly modified format. If you look up to my blog's subhead, you'll see that I've been upgraded from "charming drunk" to "massive fraggle". It was pointed out to me that should a prospective employer happen upon this little web journal, it might look bad to be seen describing myself as a drunk. It was also pointed out that I'm not even remotely charming. Both true statements.  Why "massive fraggle" you ask? That is an enigma, even to me. I suppose I just like the way it sounds. And sometimes, I guess, I feel like a fraggle, a little; but being man-sized, I'd be a massive one if I were.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to munch some radish while I work on my CivPro brief.

      JUST SO'S WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE, I want to clear up any doubt as to whether my "consanguinosexual marriage" piece from earlier was meant as some kind arguing-in-bad-faith attempt to discredit today's SCoMa decision on same-sex marriage (kind of like a wind-baggier version of what John Derbyshire does  urlLink here ). It wasn't. It was part semi-academic exercise exploring the principles of law as they've been set down, part kidding around, and part serious attempt to get people to consider the interests of a small, and generally ill-regarded sexual minority. That's all, folks. (And no, this post itself is not made in bad faith. The whole damn blog is written in good faith, ok people?)

And that the final going-into-effect of the country's first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage is going to take place a month-and-a-half before the Democratic Party convention, in the state where that convention will be held, with the key decision handed down less than a mile from the location of that convention?   Is it worth starting an investigation as to whether the 4 judges in the majority are on Karl Rove's payroll?

      FAST TURNAROUND IS FAIR PLAY Mansfield Fox: always ready to demonstrate the problems of pontificating on court opinions you haven't actually read. Apparently SCoMa did not "remand" the gay marriage issue to the legislature. (A friend asks: "can courts do that?" I reply: These days, courts can do pretty much anything they damn well please.) It seems that they rather took it upon themselves to read the definition of civil marriage in Mass. as "the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others" and ordered the lower court to issue a decision consistent with their ruling, but then stayed entry of the judgment for 180 days. In that time, the legislature can act to institute same-sex marriages (or maybe civil unions? it's still unclear, but I'm growing more dubious). But if, after those 180 days have elapsed, the legislature hasn't done anything, then the court's decision goes into effect and county clerks (or whoever hands out marriage licenses in Mass.) won't constitutionally be allowed to deny them to same-sex couples any more. (I base my analysis on the words of  urlLink the right-wingers over at NRO . If I'm wrong here, blame them. Blame me only for relying on them a little too much.)

      JUST TO MAKE TROUBLE, I ASK "What about consanguinosexual couples?" As I've said, I haven't read the  Goodridge v. Massachusetts  opinion for want of a working link, but the gist of the court's reasoning seems to be 1) that marriage is a fundamental right, 2) that denying access to that right to homosexual couples creates a caste of second-class citizens 3) in violation of the Massachusetts Constitution's guarantee of equality of citizenship.  The question, then, is this: why don't these arguments apply with equal force to enforcing the rights of consanguineous couples to marry? After all, if marriage is a fundamental right, then the government must summon up a compelling state interest in order to restrict it, and must do so in a narrowly tailored way. What are the compelling state interests supporting a ban on sibling marriage? I can think of three: morality, tradition, and the public health. But I don't think any of these three will withstand judicial scrutiny.   1. Morality. The ban on consanguineous marriage is justified on the grounds that people think its  wrong  for siblings to marry one another. But the public morality justification seems no longer to be a valid argument for restricting a fundamental right after  Lawrence v. Texas.  If a public belief in the wrongness of homosexual sodomy wasn't sufficient ground for a law restricting the fundamental right to private consensual sexual relations, then why would the public belief in the wrongness of sibling marriages be enough to restrict the fundamental right to marry?  2. Tradition. The ban on consanguineous marriage is justified by a kind of constitutional adverse possession. The law in the United States has always barred marriage between siblings. At no point in the drafting of the various "equality" provisions of the federal Constitution or any of the state constitutions did anyone, let alone a majority of people, think those guarantees of equality threatened the laws against incestuous marriage. But the tradition argument seems, at least implicitly, rejected by the  Goodridge  decision. Surely the denial of marriage rights to homosexual couples has at least as long a pedigree as the laws against sibling marriage. If tradition could not save heterosexual-only marriage, why should it be able to preserve a regime of law that forbids incestuous marriages?  3. Public health. The ban on consanguineous marriage is justified by the risk to the public health created by allowing too-closely-related people to marry and reproduce. The children of consanguineous couples are more likely to suffer from birth defects and diseases related to inbreeding. It is in the public interest to prevent these birth defects and diseases, and a ban on sibling marriage is an acceptable way to achieve that. Even if we accept the idea that incestuous procreation overwhelmingly leads to these problems (and I think the science is far from clear on this point) this justification still won't pass proper constitutional scrutiny.   The problem with the public health justification is that it is significantly under- and over-inclusive. It's over-inclusive in the sense that sterile incestuous couples, who by definition  can't  breed, are covered under the ban even though they pose none of the public health risk that justified the ban. It's under-inclusive because the ban doesn't cover those non-incestuous couples who nevertheless have the right combination of recessive genes to create those birth defects and diseases should they breed. It's also under-inclusive because it doesn't touch those consanguineous couples that choose to breed outside of marriage, who pose precisely the same risk to the public health as married sibling couples that breed do.   It's also worth considering whether this public health justification is generalizable. Does the state have the right to forbid HIV-positive individuals to marry, on the grounds that they might reproduce and produce HIV-positive offspring? Should the state require couples to submit to genetic testing to determine whether both are carrying the recessive genes for sickle-cell anemia, or hemophillia, and refuse them a marriage license if they do? If we don't think so, then isn't our refusal to grant equal rights to consanguineous couples simply a product of our animus against such couples, no matter how much we dress it up in the language of science and public health?

      YOGI NODS Or, as we say in Yankee country, "It ain't over 'till it's over." So the gay marriage issue heads to the Massachusetts legislature. It's unclear whether  Goodridge v. Massachusetts  requires marriage, or whether civil unions will suffice. And, of course, the legislature can always propose an amendment to the Massachusetts constitution restricting marriage to different-sex couples only.   One interesting thing to note, though: this ain't Vermont, circa 1999. The governor of Massachusetts isn't some Howard Dean liberal. He's a socially conservative Mormon. Any bets as to whether he wants to go down in history as the man who signed into law America's first gay marriage law? Or who took civil unions from being a Vermont-based out-lier and made them mainstream, at least in the blue states?  Oh, this ain't over. Not by a long shot.

      ONE MORE STEP IN THE LONG, HARD SLOG towards the equality of homosexual and heterosexual relationships taken today. Though I can't find a working link, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has just ruled that restricting civil marriage to heterosexual couples violates the Massachusetts state constitution. Here's the money quote, via  urlLink the Corner :   Marriage is a vital social institution. The exclusive commitment of two individuals to each other nurtures love and mutual support; it brings stability to our society. For those who choose to marry, and for their children, marriage provides an abundance of legal, financial, and social benefits. In return it imposes weighty legal, financial, and social obligations. The question before us is whether, consistent with the Massachusetts Constitution, the Commonwealth may deny the protections, benefits, and obligations conferred by civil marriage to two individuals of the same sex who wish to marry. We conclude that it may not. The Massachusetts Constitution affirms the dignity and equality of all individuals. It forbids the creation of second-class citizens. In reaching our conclusion we have given full deference to the arguments made by the Commonwealth. But it has failed to identify any constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples.    Apparently, however, the court didn't just issue the couple a marriage license, but instead remanded the issue to the legislature. So, as they say in the Commonwealth,  dis iddn't ovah.

I certainly hope the Bush administration finds a place for him, preferably higher up, where he's visible and gets to speak a lot. Maybe as some kind of high level undersecretary in HHS, a position from which he can emerge as an eventual successor to Tommy Thompson in 2006 or so.

      I'M WATCHING THE JEFFERSON JACKSON DINNER on CSPAN right now. I'm sure you're dying to know: who sang the national anthem? Well, I'll tell you. The Gay Men's Choir of Des Moines. I have two thoughts re: the GMCDM.  One:  they weren't very good. This isn't to speak ill of them. "The Star-Spangled Banner" is a hard one to sing properly. I, for instance, can't do it. But, y'know, if I were gonna sing it on national TV, I'd wanna be able to hit the high notes.  Two:  I think it says something meaningful about the Democratic Party that they had a not-very-good gay men's choir open at the JJ Dinner. It seems clear to me that it's more important to the Dems to include a gay group than to have a group that could sing the anthem well. And that says something about the Democrats. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I don't know, and leave to you.

      MANSFIELD FOX: RELOADED Saw  The Matrix: Revolutions  last night with my roommate and his girlfriend, who's in town for a visit. My Good Lord, what a load of crap. Amazingly, it was actually better than I'd expected, if only because I had such sub-basement-level expectations from all the bad reviews I'd read. In that respect, it benefited tremendously from following the boring-cum-confusing  The Matrix: Reloaded , which in turn suffered from following the mind-blowing-and-exciting-if-confusing  The Matrix .   It's a shame they made the sequels, just like its a shame they made  The Next Joe Millionaire . Not just because they're a waste of everyone's time and money. More importantly, they really make me question my fondness for the original. When I came out of  The Matrix: Reloaded , I thought to myself "If this is what  The Matrix  was about, then  The Matrix  sucked." Needless to say,  Revolutions  didn't do anything to restore my faith in the non-suckiness of the original. The first movie took a neat idea and made a tight little sci-fi action movie with a very distinct (and very cool) visual style out of it. The sequel took that neat idea and pumped it full of pseudo-philosophical mumbo-jumbo until it was ponderously enormous. In the third movie, they've let out most of the hot air, which is why it isn't as insufferable as the second. But having stretched  The Matrix 's conceptual skin so much, there was no way to return to the lean, lithe form of the original. So now they've got an enormous, ponderous movie that's filled with  nothing . It's just a huge, pointless action movie. Which is fine: I love huge, pointless action movies. But the original  Matrix  was more than that. ahh, well...  There is a silver lining to all this, though. If the Wachowski brothers were going to ruin the Matrix franchise, I'm glad they got it over with quickly. It took George Lucas twenty years to get around to ruining the Star Wars franchise. In the meantime, a whole generation of geeks, dorks and dweebs (including myself) grew up believing that Star Wars has SERIOUS THINGS TO SAY, about the nature of man, about underlying cross-cultural Jungian patterns of myth and blah blah blah.... In retrospect, of course, it all seems ludicrous. For God's sake, the movie had gay robots in it! And teddy-bear freedom fighters! Why did we take this seriously?!? And yet, we did. And it made the mind-blowing-godawfulness of the prequels all the more painful. They weren't just making the original movies look bad. They were destroying twenty years worth of broadly (and sometimes deeply) held belief that the Star Wars trilogy was about something more than people dressed in ridiculous costumes trying to shoot each other with laser guns while flying around in space ships. The Wachowskis basically killed in the cradle any parallel mythologizing about  The Matrix . The Matrix movies are about people dressed in ridiculous costumes trying to shoot each other with automatic weapons while doing cool, gravity defying flips. That's it. Everything else is window dressing.

       VERY  EARLY EXIT POLLING DATA INDICATES... Anyone who knows me knows I like to make outrageously bold statements and predictions. I am on record as believing, for instance, that I will die at age 77 by being covertly executed as a political prisoner, probably by means of a low caliber shot to the back of the skull.   In that spirit, Mansfield Fox now presents your 2004 election results...today!   Presidential Popular Vote  Bush (R)       54% Dean (D)      39% Kucinich (G)    7%   Presidential Electoral College Vote  Bush (R)       355 Dean (D)      183 Kucinich (G)      0   The electoral vote will be much closer than the lopsided popular vote, chiefly because Bush will pick up large portions of his popular majority in large states like California, Illinois and New York, that he'll lose.       Key Senate Races  Democrats pick up: Alaska, Illinois Republicans pick up: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina

      THE IMPORTANCE OF READING MY OWN BLOG CAREFULLY Argh! Looking back on the original post, I now feel my first statement, that there were only two GOP "challengers" was accurate. But my second post (four Republicans running) presents a more accurate picture of the situation. I'm going to stop correcting myself now. My blog is good enough, smart enough, and doggonit, people like it.

      I LIKE THAT FLYER FOR SEVERAL REASONS One: it reveals one of the real oddities of New Haven politics. The opposition party in town isn't the Republicans, its the Green Party.  urlLink Yale Insider reports that only 2 of the city's 30 districts have Republican challengers (scroll down).  This strikes me, who's basically only familiar with national politics, as an odd development. I wonder if there's an analog in Red America - are there any places where there are no Democrats who run for office, and the opposition party is the Libertarians? I suspect not, but I'd be curious to find out.  Another reason I like it is that it has me thinking about one of my favorite topics, eminent domain. I'm not at all sure why I get so jazzed up about such a relatively unsexy topic, but I do. Maybe its the old populist, anti-corporate heart of me. So many eminent domain cases you hear about involve a town seizing people's homes in order to put up a WalMart or a new Toyota factory or somesuch. Cases that really stretch the limits of legitimate eminent domain seizures. As a result, I've become reflexively anti-eminent domain. My gut reaction whenever I hear the phrase is basically "This is an outrage! LAWLESS!"  And that was how I felt when I first heard about this plan. How could they consider tearing down Mamoun's? I  love  Mamoun's!  What a lawless outrage!  But now I'm not so sure. A magnet school seems, at least on its face, like a good idea, and one that'll really benefit the kids of New Haven. Maybe Howe & Chapel isn't the best place to put the school. And certainly the aldermen should discuss rather than simply rubber-stamp the proposal. But it seems foolish to me to reflexively oppose a plan that might really do some good just because some of "your favorite eateries" might have to close or be relocated.

      SPEAKING OF ELECTIONS On my way back from lunch, I was stopped by electioneers near the Ward 2 polling station and handed the following flyer (reproduced as best I can):  " Do You Want to See Your Favorite Eateries Disappear???!!! The City and Board of Ed. are proposing to build An Arts and Humanities Co-Op High School on the Block of Howe & Chapel St.   This project will displace and/or effect numerous local businesses, including  India Palace ,  Mamoun's ,  and   Pizza House , and will destroy the heart of a rebounding neighborhood.  The City has announced -  after no Community input  - thta it will use eminent domain to bulldoze several properties for a replacement Arts Magnet Co-op High School.  The school is currently located near the AUDOBON ARTS DISTRICT in a neighborhood that includes the Educational Center for the Arts, the Neighborhood Music school, the Lincoln Theatre, the Arts Council Performance Space and the Creative Arts Workshop.   YOU can help stop this destructive project.   During this election, the Democratic Party machine is counting on  LOW VOTER TURNOUT  to take this district away from  Joyce Chen, an idependent-minded Green Party Alderman.   They know that Joyce Chen has a record of supporting local business, and remaining independent from machine politics.   A VOTE FOR JOYCE IS A VOTE FOR SAVING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!!! "

      HOORAY, ELECTION DAY! America's favorite  urlLink non-holiday . In honor of the day, I've decided to acquaint myself with local politics.   I've discovered that I live in Ward 22, which covers my side of Mansfield Street, Science Hill, the Law School, the Hall of Graduate Studies, Ezra Styles and Morse Colleges, and the residential neighborhood bounded by Dixwell Avenue, Munson Street and Winchester Street.   My alderwoman is Mae Ola Riddick, who served from 1996-1997 but was turned out of office after a mini-scandal involving some unaccounted-for federal housing funds. (Though she was never charged with anything.  urlLink See the YDN for more details. ) Riddick returned to office in 2001, defeating the woman who'd beaten her, and has served since. I don't know much else about her, I must confess, except that she seems to be some kind of "community activist."   I think tomorrow I'm going to go register to vote in New Haven. Certainly some time this week. No reason to stay registered in NYC anymore: I don't really care about local politics there, and its unlikely the GOP is going to turn the 2004 senate race into a contested one. Connecticut, man: that's where its at!

      THERE'S SOME SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE FRENCH  urlLink over at Belgravia Dispatch , which apparently spring out of  urlLink what Tariq Aziz is telling his interrogators  about the situation in Iraq on the eve of the war.    It may be, of course, that Aziz is making this up. However, if what he's said is true then this is serious, and a further confirmation of my general sense that the French and Russians need to be taken behind the woodshed.  One note though: assume that Aziz is telling the truth. That means that Saddam didn't order a counterattack in the opening hours of the war because he believed, thanks to French and Russian advice, that the Americans were not serious about invading his country, and that if he just hunkered down and outlasted the airstrikes, the French and Russians would negotiate a ceasefire that would save his hide. An early counterattack would have produced many of the nightmare scenarios envisioned in prewar planning: massive numbers of oilfields set ablaze, Kuwait City and perhaps Riyadh pummelled from the air, perhaps the use of chemical weapons (if they existed) against our troops. At any rate, it would have made the invasion bloodier and more difficult.   In this case, Franco-Russian perfidy may have saved American, Kuwaiti and Iraqi lives, and aided in the overthrow of Saddam. Not deliberately, of course, but nevertheless...

      YOU KNOW WHO I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR?  Howard Dean . We're talking about a man who called the Democratic Leadership Council  "the Republican wing of the Democratic Party" , and now he's crying foul because other candidates for the Democratic nomination have the temerity to attack him.  It would be one thing if this were next May, and Dean had wrapped up the nomination, and Lieberman and Kerry were still going around saying he couldn't beat Bush. Then, of course, McAuliffe should step in, slap them upside the head and say "Shaddap, knuckleheads!" But Dean hasn't won anything yet. These guys aren't attacking Dean out of pique; they're doing it because they still think they can win, and they see their "electibility" as their big advantage over Dean.  If Dean wants to call of the primaries and declare himself the winner right now, he should say so. Otherwise, he shouldn't go crying to the party chairman every time one of the other kids on the playground pushes back.

      SADDAM & THE DEATH PENALTY     Is it possible to oppose the death penalty generally, but support it for Saddam?  (or Osama, for that matter?)  I actually think it is, for reasons mostly of prudence rather than of principle. Call it the Napoleon Principle: lifetime imprisonment for former dictators (or, I suppose, global terrorist ringleaders) is all well and good, but only insofar as you're actually imprisoning them for life. If Saddam is imprisoned for life, there's still the remote possibility that he can escape, and return to power. Which would be bad. On a scale that the escape of an ordinary murderer is not.   Steven Pollard takes a different view. Read, and see what you think.

      GOVERNING COUNCIL, TOE TO TOE WITH SADDAM  A riveting account of the encounter between members of the Iraqi Governing Council and Hussein.  These men were driven into exile, or imprisoned and tortured by Hussein and his henchmen. And now, with a little help from their American allies, they're finally able to confront him, face to face. And they can see him now for what he truly is, stripped of his wealth, his power, his ability to sew terror in the hearts of others: a pathetic, cowardly old man with nothing left in the world but his own black heart and the coming justice that awaits him.   Stories like this,  and pictures like these , remind me why I'm so very glad we did what we did last spring.

      RE: MY EARLIER POST ON MCCAIN-FEINGOLD  John Fund says that the decision is emblematic of how Justice O'Connor has become a "judicial activist".  But that's a total abuse of that expression.  They upheld the law!  They deferred to Congress. You can say that she's  wrong , or that the ruling upholds a liberal rather than conservative policy preference, but to say that this is an example of "judicial activism" is just lunacy.  Unless, of course, "judicial activism" is just a code-word that means "judicial decisions that further liberal policy preferences."   Let's try to imagine what a politically neutral definition of "judicial activism" would be. I'll offer up this:  A court have engaged in a judicial activism when either       a) in the presence of an explicit constitutional provision that can plausibly be construed in more than one way, the court substitutes its interpretation of that constitutional provision for an equally plausible interpretation by the legislature or executive, or       b) in the absence of any explicit constitutional provision, the court substitutes its policy preferences for that of the legislature or executive.  But of course, if this is the definition, then it is the dissenters, and not the majority, that are the judicial activists in  McConnell v. FEC . That is not to say that they're  wrong . They may be exactly right. But they're the ones who want to substitute their reading of the First Amendment for the one that was passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, a reading which clearly struck the political branches as being a plausible understanding of the First Amendment and is shared by many serious legal thinkers.  As Seinfeld might say  Not that there's anything wrong with that.

I've always liked Pettitte, and was glad a few years back when they didn't trade him for Chuck Finley (man, would that have been a mistake). He's a great pitcher, and a real gamer. But still, he has a right to play closer to home if he wants to, and I actually really admire the fact that he took a decent-sized pay cut ($3 million a year, it seems) because he wanted to be able to live with his children year-round.

      THIS I LOVE. I was at the Supreme Court yesterday when they announced that   they'd ruled the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act constitutional.  It was very cool to be there for the announcement (and a total surprise: we thought we were just there to hear a Miranda case and a redistricting case). So that I love.  But I also love the decision that was handed down. Not because I'm a huge supporter of BiCRA, or anything. I'm generally ambivalent about this kind of legislation, though somewhat sympathetic to those who say its an unconstitutional abridgment of speech and very sympathetic to those who say that campaign finance regulations are ultimately not very effective at preventing the evils they're seeking to prevent.  What I love about the decision is the message it sends to members of Congress, especially Republicans, and the President. The Court is not going to do their public policy dirty work. When BiCRA was passed, many of its Republican supporters (including the President) seemed to basically be of the position that the bill had some problems, and that parts of it were probably unconstitutional, but that it was OK to pass it because the Supreme Court would hear a case involving the law and strike down all the unconstitutional parts. The situation, they thought, was win-win: they get the public relations victory of supporting the passage of a popular law, but would be insulated from many of the worst effects of that law because the Court would strike them down as unconstitutional.   Except the Court didn't. It refused to do Congress and the President's dirty work for them. This is the perfect example of precisely when to use so-called Thayerite review (heavy deference to the political branches). Part of Thayer's idea is that whenever courts start activistically striking down laws on constitutional grounds, it removes much of the incentive for the political branches and the public to debate issues of constitutional law, to ask about a proposed law not just "is this a good idea?" but "is this consistent with the constitution?". Whatever the proper role of each branch is in interpreting the constitution (and this is a subject of much debate) it seems to me that Congress and the President are at least obliged not to pass laws that  they themselves  believe to be unconstitutional.  Here, the Court may or may not be wrong on the substance of the Constitution, but their error, if there was one, is correctable by Congress simply amending the law to strike out provisions it believes are unconstitutional. And in the meantime, the Court's decision creates exactly the right incentives  vis a vis  the political branches and the constitution. So huzzah! for Sandra D.

      SHAZAM!  The other shoe drops.  Nick Johnson, Juan Rivera and Randy Choate for a one-year rental of Javier Vazquez. I couldn't have asked for a nicer 23rd birthday present. I really like Johnson and Rivera as players, and I'm going to miss them. On the other hand, they'll get to play everyday in Montreal, and can maybe finally develop into the quality players they have the potential to be.   And for the Yankees, of course, this is a coup. If they can resign Pettitte and pull the trigger on the Kevin Brown-for-Jeff Weaver trade, their rotation next year will be: Mike Mussina, Andy Pettitte, Kevin Brown, Javier Vazquez, and Jose Contreras, with John Lieber as a spot-starter.  Tell me honestly that you'd rather have Pedro Martinez, Curt Schilling, Derek Lowe, Tim Wakefield, and Scott Sauerbeck as your starting five? Perhaps Boston can sign Bartolo "Fatty" Colon or Kevin "No Game" Millwood and hope to maybe pull into the lead, but for now the Evil Empire has the edge.  But you know what's really going to make me happy? When the Red Sox offense goes into the toilet next year. This is going to happen, no matter how much the Sox fans want to keep their heads buried in the sand. Think about it: Boston was a great offensive team last year, but that had more than a little to do with the fact that virtually their entire offense had career years last year. Manny and Nomar are proven superstars. Johnny Damon is about that good, as are, I believe, Trot Nixon and Jason Varitek. But do any of you Sox fans really believe that Bill Mueller, Kevin Millar, Todd Walker, and David Ortiz are .300+ BA, 20+ home-run hitters? Of course not. So they're going to fall off, and the Boston lineup is suddenly going to become human again.   Meanwhile, the Yankees offense is going to surge. First of all, they've effectively traded in Nick Johnson for Gary Sheffield. That's clearly an upgrade. But even if they hadn't (or don't: the Sheff deal still isn't completed) they'd be a much better offensive team next year than last year. Because while everyone on the Sox was having a career year last year, a good part of the Yankees lineup was hurt. Jeter, Giambi, and Williams all had serious injury problems that hampered their offensive production. Soriano had a down year. Matsui was just getting used to American baseball. Boone had to switch leagues halfway through the season. Only Posada had a career-best year, and I think that his season, like Varitek's and Nixon's, was a marker of his true ability rather than a one-time fluke.    In short: Yanks regain the pitching edge. Boston offense stumbles back to Earth, New York offense leads the league. Much wailing and gnashing of teeth in New England. And the Fox simply smiles....

      IS IT JUST ME,  or has the Daily Quickie on ESPN.com gotten more worldly of late?  Today's Q involves references to blogger  The Gawker,  the phenomenon of auctioning off virtual girlfriends on E-Bay, and a joke about Dean's firing Joe Trippi.  I'm not complaining: I've never believed that sports was a subject that should be hermetically sealed off from the rest of life, and since the Q is a humor page it makes sense that it should make fun of whatever it finds funny. Still, a curious development. One wonders: are the increasingly bloggish nature of the Q, and Bill Simmons new "superblog," a kind of atonement by ESPN for their shameful firing of Gregg Easterbrook last year? Or is it just that, in this faster-faster universe, everything gets bloggier after a while?

      WATCH THOSE METAPHORS, BILL Bill Bennett, you know, the one with the gambling problem, commented upon the Democratic primary thusly (as summarized by  RealClear Politics ):  "Bennett's comment, which I had read somewhere earlier in the week, was that since 1952 every candidate who has won Iowa and New Hampshire has gone on to win their parties nomination. Bennett suggested that if you were in the World Series of Poker Kerry would have a 90% chance of ending up with the nomination."  If you were an erstwhile public moralist who'd recently been scoured for losing millions of dollars in high-stakes gambling, wouldn't you try to pick a different metaphor for your public comments on electoral politics?

      TIM NOAH MAKES A SENSIBLE POINT ABOUT THE SOUTH  It's not a swing region.  It's the core of the Republican base. It is to the Democrats what California is to the Republicans: a place they're only going to win if they're running away with the election. Yeah, Bill Clinton won 4 southern states in 1992, and they netted him 39 electoral votes. But you know what? He beat Bush in an electoral landslide, 370-168. You know what would have happened if Bush the Elder had swept the entire old confederacy? Clinton would have won in a somewhat smaller electoral landslide, 331-207. Similarly, in 1996, Clinton won 4 southern states (exchanging Georgia for Florida, a twelve electoral vote pickup) which gave him 51 electoral votes. But you know what? Clinton beat Dole in the Electoral College, 379-159. And if Dole had completely swept the south? Clinton still wins, 328-210.    The Old Confederacy is the most heavily Republican region in the country. It's not terribly shocking that a Democrat, in a close race, would write it off. Republicans have basically written off California and the I-95 corridor in the same fashion. They know they're not going to win there unless they're going to win the election anyway. But nobody gives them flack for it, because "California and the I-95 corridor" isn't a recognizable geographical-political region in the way that "the South" is. And nobody in the Republican primaries talks about how the eventual nominee needs to be someone who can appeal to people in Vermont, or Rhode Island. They have a base region, and certain swing states that they target (Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania). If New England or California goes Republican, great. If they don't, they don't. It's no big deal, because the Republicans don't need them to win. The Democrats could be the same way. Why they're not is anyone's guess.

      THE YOUTH OF AMERICA AND ABORTION  There's an interesting poll  Newsweek  poll on the political attitudes of Americans aged 18-29.  While I'm skeptical of opinion polls in general,  and  Newsweek  polls in particular , I'll accept, for the sake of argument, that the numbers here are valid. There's lots of good stuff about gay marriage, Iraq, etc., but one thing that struck me was the attitude of people of my generation towards abortion. We were evenly split (50% for, 49% against) on the issue of whether there ought to be a ban on abortions with a "rape, incest, life of the mother" exception. But 60% said they supported  Roe v. Wade , whereas only 38% oppose it.   Newsweek 's spin on this is that the young are weary of re-fighting the culture war:   "The obvious distinction between opposition to abortion and opposition to Roe indicates that while young voters may not be altogether comfortable with abortion, they are wary of re-engaging in the fiery battles of the past."  But isn't another hypothesis equally plausible? Isn't it possible that at least some people of my generation are sufficiently historically or legally ignorant that they don't understand what  Roe  actually says? Isn't it possible that the 10% of people who favor a ban on virtually all abortions but also say they support  Roe  don't actually understand that the latter makes the former impossible? Maybe they think that before  Roe  it was unconstitutional for states  not  to ban abortions.   Honestly, given how we're always hearing about how college students can't answer simple questions about American history, or don't understand basic things about how the government works, why shouldn't we think that some percent of people polled don't actually understand what the actual holding of  Roe v. Wade  is? No offense to  Newsweek , but isn't that a somewhat more plausible explanation of the poll results than the idea that young people are desperate not to re-fight the culture wars, and are willing to accept heavy cognitive dissonance as the price? Don't get me wrong:  I'm  not eager to re-fight the culture wars, and I doubt that most of my co-generationists are either. But, following William of Occam, shouldn't we look to plain old garden-variety ignorance before constructing elaborate theories to explain odd poll results?

You are sensitive and caring, and you don't take insults well.  You don't smile much, but when you do, you really mean it.  People like to be around you because you are a calming influence.  You have an appreciation for all things beautiful, and you probably have some potted plants.  You also most likely own a cat.  You like Sundays and hot tea.  You will spend your entire life yearning for quiet beauty, which is a rarity in this world, so you read a lot.

       IT'S STORIES LIKE THIS  that make me skeptical about the International Criminal Court. "War crimes" are things like the systematic rape of civilians, or the summary execution of POWs. The use of imprecise munitions, that's something else. It's not great, and in an ideal world weapons would only kill the bad guys. But calling cluster bomb use a war crime cheapens the whole idea of "war crimes", and I'm afraid may deaden our revulsion at actual atrocities. It's like the "Bush = Hitler" analogy. If every right-winger is a Nazi, then what would you call a real Nazi if you met one? A Republican with a flair for the dramatic?

      TNR'S DEAN-O-PHOBE SUGGESTS AN INTERESTING POSSIBILITY  That a Kerry victory in Iowa actually  helps  Dean,  insofar as it prevents the party from coalescing at an earlier point around an anti-Dean. Does this mean that having two candidates beat him is even  better  for Dean, since there are now three viable candidates to split the anti-Dean vote? Or does it suggest that the party doesn't need a single anti-Dean, since even a divided field has shown it can squash People-Powered Howard? I know opposition to Dean is the Dean-O-Phobe's  raison d'etre , but maybe the race's dynamic has changed such that it's no longer Dean vs. Anti-Dean. Maybe we're back where we were a year ago, with a field of three viable mainstream candidates (except we've replaced Gephardt with Edwards and Lieberman with Clark) and an insurgent Dean as the outside challenger.

      QUICK IOWA THOUGHTS   Dick Gephardt's run is over. But we all knew that. He's basically been going through the motions for months, hoping that organization would propel him to an Iowa win, which would slingshot him into competitiveness elsewhere in the country. i.e., he was hoping against hope. And now he's done. He had a great career, and in an alternate universe in which Bush won in '92, he might've been the nominee in '96. But not in this universe, I'm afraid.  Dean is obviously a loser, but how big a loser is difficult to project. He's still got a ton of money and (apparently) pretty good national organization, so he can keep the fight going. On the other hand, no small amount of his national support may I suspect have been based on the idea of Dean's inevitability. Once that bubble is popped, can he continue? He's obviously not going to drop out, but is his fate now to soldier on and get 15-20% in every subsequent primary?  And (bonus question): if Dean's not the nominee, will his core voters show up to the polls in November? And will they vote Democrat, or Green?  I love John Edwards. (no seriously, I  love  John Edwards. see below.) He's obviously a big winner here today. His big worry, I imagine, has got to be: if Kerry wins in Iowa, and follows up with a win in New Hampshire, can Edwards stop his momentum in veteran-heavy South Carolina?  Kerry is tonight's big winner. And the one that makes me look like a big yutz, since only two weeks ago I was trying to figure out how best to make fun of a friend who was working for the Kerry campaign when his candidate dropped out of the race. Obviously I'm still cleaning egg out of my eyebrows.  Buuuuut , and this is a big but, I still think Kerry is a lousy candidate, and that this is ultimately going to fizzle somewhere along the line. Maybe it won't be until after he's sown up the nomination, but I just can't see John Kerry not screwing this up somewhere. Remember: a year ago, Kerry was the front-runner. Then he spent a year frittering away his lead, and only recovered it in a last minute push. This wasn't accidental. I can't shake the feeling that Kerry will find a way to blow this somehow.  I strongly suspect that Clark is the #2 loser out of Iowa, trailing only Gephardt. If Kerry's become a viable candidate all of a sudden, then the whole rationale for his campaign is evaporating before our eyes. I always thought of Clark as Kerry mark 2: the same model of politician (electable war-hero insulated on national defense issues by his biography) with some of the initial bugs worked out. It's worth remembering that Clark didn't get rolled off the assembly line until late summer, when the Kerry campaign had (apparently) made it clear that it wasn't up to the task of stopping Dean. But Clark-bot has shown that he isn't exactly bug-free himself (evidenced chiefly by his propensity to say looney things) and all of a sudden Kerry-bot's bugs don't look so bad. So you've got Kerry with the big Mo, coming back to a state neighboring his home, where Clark's numbers have been stalled for a few weeks. I do believe Clark is done.   OK, perhaps these thoughts weren't so quick. Back to studying for contracts! HO!

      BLOG IN HASTE, REPENT AT LEISURE When I linked to  this  article earlier, I was a bit, er,  hasty . The website for  The Australian  was running slow, and I couldn't get the page to load past the title. I made a critical assumption about the subject of the article: that it was about East Timor. In fact, it was about West Timor, which is still part of Indonesia, and not under U.N. mandate. Inserting my foot squarely into my mouth, I used the article (or, more exactly, the headline) as a base from which to attack the U.N.'s nation-building track record.  Now, I continue to think that we're, on balance, better off without the U.N. running Iraq, but the  Australian  piece wasn't exactly on point.

       "TIMOR MORE DANGEROUS THAN IRAQ"  Think about that: the U.N. has been in East Timor for four-and-a-half years (since August 1999). They were  invited  by the people of East Timor. East Timor is a small half-island of 860,000 people (almost one sixth the population of Baghdad, and one twenty-sixth the population of Iraq). How incompetent are these people? And: shouldn't this make us somewhat skeptical about the inherent benefits of internationalizing the occupying forces?  Thirty-one countries had troops there in 2002 , including a number of countries that have declined to participate in Iraq (Russia, Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Pakistan, among others). Maybe we're better-off in Iraq without these guys, and without a United Nations mandarin-class running the show.

Or maybe that Electronic Arts, which acts as the government of Alphaville, would close down his newspaper and send the professor's Sim counterpart into exile, "for the good of the game and its community"? Or maybe it's that there is a seamy underbelly to Alphaville at all, filled with con artists, virtual prostitutes, some kind of Sims mafia and a crooked, parallel town government?

      A GOOD ANALYSIS OF THE SADDAM P.O.W. ISSUE can be found  here.  ( Link via the Conspiracy ) The basic gist: contrary to what you may be hearing/reading in the mainstream media, Saddam's current P.O.W. status has no impact whatsoever on whether the Iraqis will eventually be able to try him for war crimes. It had been suggested that now that he's been classified as a P.O.W. the United States would have to try him for war crimes, if he were going to be tried at all. Mr. Carter lays out, with cites to the Geneva Convention, why that's not so.  But if you think about it, that just makes sense. Virtually all of the crimes for which Saddam will be tried took place before the invasion, and don't involve the Americans at all. Under the "the U.S. must now try him" theory, a person declared a P.O.W. can only be tried in military commissions belonging to the occupying power. If this theory is correct, it produces all sorts of crazy results.   Take the case of a hypothetical Iraqi soldier, whom we'll call Ali. Before being conscripted into the army, Ali was a petty thief who stole air conditioners from apartments in the upscale neighborhoods of Baghdad. Early in the war, Ali is captured in the battle of Umm Qasr by British soldiers, who detain him as a P.O.W. Under the theory being promoted by the news agencies, only the Coalition could try Ali, not just for any violations of the law of war he may have committed  but also for his past air conditioner theft.  Iraqi civilian authorities would have lost the power to try him for that crime forever. And even if we assume that military commissions have jurisdiction over all past unpunished misdeeds committed by captured prisoners of war (which is, to say the least, a stretch) it's hard to believe that the Coalition would be all that interested in punishing old air conditioner thefts, or any number of other petty crimes committed before their arrival. Which means that when hostilities have ended and Ali and his fellow P.O.W.s are repatriated to Iraq they will be immunized, forever, from the possibility of prosecution for their pre-war crimes.   As I said: crazy results.

It seems a German publisher in the late '30s was interested in putting out a German-language version of  The Hobbit , and had contacted Tolkien's publisher, Allen & Unwin to negotiate a deal. But before negotiations began, they wanted to know: was Tolkien of aryan extraction? The blogger posts a draft of Tolkien's reply, which is great, and adds an interesting data-point to the "is the Lord of the Rings racist?" debate.

      WHAT IS BOB NOVAK SMOKING?   In his most recent column,  national-security endangerer  Robert Novak  frets  about the possibility that Sandra Day O'Connor might use the redistricting case currently before the Supreme Court as an opportunity to once again betray the conservatives that put her on the bench, and show her true allegiance to Sauron, The Enemy, keeper of Barad-Dur, Lord of the Earth, or the Democrats, or whomever. After all, she sided with the liberal judges on gay rights! and campaign-finance reform!  There's only one problem with Novak's analysis:  it's totally crazy!  We are, I assume, talking about the same Sandra Day O'Connor who said in her concurring opinion in  Davis v. Bandemer  expressed the opinion that political gerrymandering questions were non-justiciable political questions? And the same Sandra Day O'Connor who, in the oral arguments for this case (which, by the way, I attended), all but said she intended to stick with the non-justiciability. (Her words, as quoted  urlLink here : "Maybe the way to go is to just stay hands off these things.") We're supposed to believe that she's going to abandon these apparently deeply held beliefs because the three-judge panel in Texas that recently ruled on that state's recent gerrymandering warned of "excessive partisanship"?  Perhaps Novak should stick with his core competencies, like revealing the names of covert CIA agents, and leave Supreme Court panic-mongering to the professionals.

      I'M GENERALLY INCLINED TO DISTRUST POLLS, but I wanted to pass on this nugget from the latest   CNN/ USA TODAY/ Gallup poll . Scroll down to question 13, which asks regarding a hypothetical Bush/Dean matchup in November (which I think we can all agree is the most likely scenario): "How certain are you that you will vote for Bush or Dean next fall, or do you think you may change your mind between now and the November election?"   Look at the numbers (in the "likely voter" category):   Certain for Dean      20%  Vote for Dean, may change mind      17%  Vote for Bush, may change mind      12%  Certain for Bush      47%  No opinion      4%  Those numbers are, to put it mildly, astonishing. If these numbers are correct (and that's a BIG assumption, obviously) then all Bush has to do, between now and election day is convince an additional 4% of likely voters to vote for him, and he'll lock in a win, with the first presidential-election majority since his father won in '88. Dean, on the other hand, has to either convince essentially every likely voter who isn't already locked-in with Bush to vote Democratic, or else bring to the polls such a huge number of previously-unlikely-to-vote persons to overcome Bush's apparently huge advantage among likely voters.    There numbers aren't determinative, not in one poll, not eleven months out. But they surely don't mean  nothing .

      I LIKE DONALD RUMSFELD He's right near the top of the "living people I've never met but nonetheless have warm feelings for" list, trailing the Pope. (I try to reserve my affection for people I actually  know , which is, I think, a rarity in this celebrity-obsessed world of ours, but I am, of course, an old-fashioned guy.) There's just something magnetic about Rummy. He's the kind of guy who could convince me to join a cult, I think. Sure, it would be a square, Midwestern cult, but it would be evil and cultish nonetheless.   I seem to have lost my original point.  Stories like this one,  in which it's revealed that Rummy turned down  Time 's "Man of the Year" honors and suggested they give it to "the American soldier" instead, are, I think, a large part of why I dig the guy so much.  You may point out: the story put forward by the  Time  editors doesn't necessarily confirm Rummy's account, does it? And: doesn't Rumsfeld lose most of the humble points he picked up by refusing the honor by bragging at a holiday party about how he declined the honor, and then having that bragging get reported in the Congressional newspaper? I say:  Do not question the decisions of the leader. He loves you. Why can you not see this? He suffers so much for our sake, and you reward him with your doubts? Do not question the leader. He will know what to do.   The night time is the right time. The night time is the right time.

      "HILLARY'S GANDHI JOKE: WAS IT OUT OF LINE?" That's  MSNBC's question of the day.  I'm torn on this issue. Generally speaking, I'm willing to grant off-color jokes a pretty wide latitude. I'll forgive a lot if something's funny.  The big problem I have with  Hillary's Gandhi "joke"  was that it wasn't funny. What exactly is the joke here? That Gandhi was Indian, and that many gas stations are run by Indian-Americans and that many Indian-Americans live in or near St. Louis? I suppose these elements could be assembled in a humorous way, but not in the way Clinton did it.  I'm reminded of  the Simpsons bit  in which McBain tries his hand at stand-up comedy:  "Did you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? [pause] That's the joke."

      THE MOVEON.ORG ANTI-BUSH ADS ARE FINALLY OUT,  and they're actually pretty good.  Some of them are downright great. I particularly like  "Child's Pay" , which is as good as any professionally produced ad for a real product I've ever seen. (As good even as the Miller Lite "Catfight" ads? I'm afraid so.)  What I find remarkable is this: as far as I know, the people who produced these ads were operating with very limited budgets and resources, less probably than even the most shoe-string long-shot moonbat candidate has at his disposal (we all know who I'm talking about, Dennis K.). But even the worst of these ads was at or above the quality of the average real-world political ad. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on presidential campaigns, but most of the TV ads they run are only a little better than those self-produced ads for local furniture companies. You know, the ones with the overweight Italian-American gentleman and his family talking about how now is a great time to buy a new loveseat...   At least local discount furniture warehouses can make the excuse that their product is just dull, and that there's no way to make a non-hokey commercial about the great deal they're offering on a slightly damaged pull-out sofa. But politics isn't dull, and the MoveOn people have demonstrated (albeit not without some ads that misfire) that political ads can be interesting. I actually don't think I'd mind a particularly nasty Dean-Bush election, full of unfair accusations and vicious televised smears, if only those ads would be  interesting . If I could feel about political ads the way I feel about beer ads, or ads for that new NFL network (God, love that Rich Eisen), and horrible mud-slinging was the price, well then sling that mud, God-damnit!

Which, combined with the fact that I've spent the morning watching the director's cut of The Two Towers instead of studying for my torts exam (or, say, going  outside ) strongly suggests I may be a huge nerd.

      OH, FANTASY FOOTBALL, YOU ENDED A WEEK TOO SOON   Y'know, given that my fantasy football team included Peyton Manning (377 yards, 5 TDs, 0 INTs), Marvin Harrison (133 yards, 2 TDs), Edgerrin James (78 yards rushing, 37 yards receiving, 1 fumble), Reggie Wayne (43 yards receiving, 1 TD), John Kasay (5 FGs, 2 PAT), and the Baltimore Ravens' defense (20 points allowed, 3 INT with one returned for a TD), I might just have had an OK week this week, if my FFL league hadn't ended with the regular season. Damn you, Yahoo!!   (P.S. When I spell-checked this post, the only alternative that the spell-checker came up with for Peyton was "python." I've no doubt Peyton would be happy to discover that Blogger.com thinks so highly of him. Interesting to note, also, that before he could be declared a python, he had to beat Jake "the Snake."  What a world this is.)

      ROSE AND THE HALL OF FAME  Baseball Musings makes an interesting point  vis a vis  Pete Rose and the Baseball Hall of Fame:  he's no lock for admission if reinstated. The basic point: you need the vote of 75% of voters to be admitted into the Hall. That means that 25% plus one, a not terribly large minority, can block the admission of any candidate. Great hitter though he was, it's not totally far-fetched to think that anti-Rose elements, with a little skillful campaigning, could meet that relatively low threshold.   Rose may be caught in a Catch-22. There are basically three types of people with respect to Pete Rose: people who think he bet on baseball and therefore shouldn't be admitted to the Hall of Fame (anti-Rose), people who think he bet on baseball but should be admitted to the Hall of Fame anyway (pro-Rose), and people who don't know whether or not he bet on baseball and therefore don't want to prejudge whether he should be admitted into the Hall of Fame (undecided). Right now, there doesn't seem to be an anti-Rose majority among fans, writers or players, which is why Rose is even getting the opportunity to come clean and get reinstated. But that's the heart of Rose's problem: he has to come clean to get reinstated. He has to admit that he bet on baseball. And once he does that, the undecideds will melt away. Rose has to, ahem, gamble that enough of the undecideds go over to the "eh, what the hell, why not?" side to push him over the 75% threshold. And I'm not sure that's such a great bet.  Also,  former Commissioner of Baseball Fay Vincent pointed out in the  Times  recently , Rose is running out of time. Since he stopped playing in 1986, he only has until 2006 to get into the Hall via regular election. After that, he'll have to go to the Veterans Committee, which, as Vincent points out, is pretty stingy when it comes to admitting overlooked players into the noble brotherhood of the Hall.    If I were a betting man like Rose, I'd say he's probably got a less than 50-50 chance of being admitted to the Hall, even if Selig reinstates him. I'm curious to see what happens.

But now  Patton  is in commercial, so I've flipped back to the Oscars. Just in time to catch Annie Lennox, singing the truly awful "Into the West". I loved  Return of the King , but that song - ugh.

      GREAT PIECE ON ST. RALPH  at the New Republic . The thesis: Ralph Nader is not a noble consumer advocate who incomprehensibly developed, at the end of his career, into a monomaniacal, paranoid fanatic who dismisses all who disagree with him as corporate stooges and traitors to liberalism. Rather, he has always been a monomaniacal, paranoid fanatic who dismisses all who disagree with him as corporate stooges and traitors to liberalism, even from his first days as the author of  Unsafe at Any Speed . My favorite part of the article is a quote from Daniel Patrick Moynihan:  "He used to warn me that the phones at the Labor Department might be tapped. I'd say, 'Fine! They'll learn that the unemployment rate for March is 5.3 percent, that's what they'll learn.'"   (The article may require registration. But really, shouldn't you have subscribed to TNR by now?)

      GOLF NEEDS A SEVENTH CONTINENT After Mass, I decided to take the afternoon off and went to hike East Rock. After I was sufficiently tired and muddy, I decided to have a late lunch at Archie Moore's.  As my burger arrived, the final round of Accenture Match Play started up on the TV. The opening credits contained the line "golfers from six continents, speaking twenty languages..." That got me thinking. Given that there are seven continents, why should we be so impressed that you managed to attract golfers from six of them? If I were friendly on the first six days of the week, but spent my Saturdays repeatedly elbowing you in the groin, would you consider that good enough? I didn't think so. So why are your standards so much lower for intercontinental representation in match-play golf? Sure, the seventh continent is a frozen wasteland. It wouldn't be easy, but is anything worthwhile ever easy? Here's my suggestion: have Phil Mickelson establish a permanent address in Queen Maud Land. First off, he can market himself as the greatest living Antarctic golfer, which should be a huge boost to his sagging ego. Second, he could build a course down there, and maybe someday convince the PGA to let him host the Championship. Then, when all the other golfers had died of hypothermia or been eaten by penguins, Lefty could emerge, the last man standing, and finally claim his major. Everybody wins! (except all the golfers who freeze to death: it's fair to say they loose.)

      WHEN I WAS AT AMHERST  I never asked to get back my MASSPIRG money.  It's not that I didn't know what the money was going for, or that I supported what MASSPIRG was up to. I was just too lazy, and it was a relatively small amount of money, so I never got around to it. I can't know for certain, but I always imagined that many of my fellow Jeffs "donated" for similar "reasons". That's why I always laugh a little when Nader decries the apathy of young people: apathy is a major source of revenue for his business!  Full disclosure: I voted for Nader in 2000, since Bush/Gore seemed like a wash and Nader was the only "major" candidate who opposed the death penalty. Man, I'm not making that mistake again!

      LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT THAT TERRORISM THING LICKED  John Kerry has vowed to name a "salmon czar" if elected.  The czar will report directly to the president and vice president on issues relating to that delicious fish (no word yet on whether there will be separate undersecretaries for bagels and cream cheese). I'm sure that this is just election-year pandering to the good people of Idaho, and that the salmon czar would get less than five minutes of President Kerry's time in the first term. And it's not likely that I would have shifted to the Kerry camp if he'd said "No, I won't name a salmon czar. The president has more important things to worry about than the status of delicious-if-suicidal river fish. Remember al Qaeda?" But I'm still a little disturbed by the idea that Kerry would even pander in this way. Unless those fish have converted to militant Islam and strapped C4 to their bodies in preparation for spawning, I don't think they're worth a minute of the president's damn time.

      MORE CHEAP KERRY BASHING! An interesting discovery via  the Social Security Administration's baby names site : tracking the popularity of the name Kerry through the decades. In the 1930s, Kerry, a name just recently imported from Australia (see  here  for all things "Kerry") was the 905th most popular boy's name, and was unranked as a girls name. By the 40s, it had risen to the 340th-ranked boy's name, and charted for the first time as the 633rd most popular girl's name. In the 50s, Kerry was the 205th most popular boy's name and the 322nd most popular girl's name. In the 60s, Kerry's popularity as a boy's name increased peaked, at 178th, while it's popularity as a girl's name dropped to 477th. In the 70s, these numbers reversed: Kerry shot up to 172nd in popularity as a girl's name, while its popularity as a boy's name plummeted to 309th. The name went into overall decline in the 80s, falling to 305th for girls and 417th for boys, and this decline continued into the 90s, when the names were ranked 657th for boys and 750th for girls.  What lessons can we draw from this? Well, for one: the popularity of Kerry as a boy's name went into free-fall sometime in the 1970s. The name had finally begun to catch on in the United States by the 1960s, peaking at a level of modest popularity. And then, suddenly, it collapsed. Dare I suggest that the Senator's 1971 testimony, which surely made him the country's most famous "Kerry," had some role in the change in the fortunes of this name? Was there something about seeing the long-faced Bostonian testify about American war crimes in the Senate that made the name no longer seem "manly" to the American public? Might that also explain why the name briefly surged in popularity as a girl's name in the decade following his testimony? (Although I'd have to say that I don't think of John Forbes Kerry as especially  feminine .  Haughty and French-looking, certainly.  But not feminine.) Might that also be the reason that the name continued its decline in the 80s and 90s, the period of John Kerry's rise to national prominence as Massachusetts lieutenant governor, and then senator? Is there just something about John Kerry that makes people uncomfortable naming their kid Kerry?  And now the big rhetorical flourish:  No single individual has done more to damage the fortunes of the name Kerry in the United States than John Forbes Kerry.  That name might have been duking it out with Logan or Taylor by now, maybe even preparing to make a run at single digits. But thanks to the Senator, it spent the 90s sandwiched squarely between perennial all-stars "Axel" and "Loren," trailing "Malachi" and narrowly beating out "Infant".       (In case anyone's curious, my own illustrious name peaked sometime early in the Taft administration, at 582nd. It then went into decline before disappearing off the rankings at the end of the 40s. I think it's just about time for a comeback, don't you?)

      LISTENED TO SOME OF JOHN KERRY'S SENATE TESTIMONY TODAY. ( And you can too : just click the link and fast-forward through the first bit, which is from the Winter Soldier investigation and doesn't feature Kerry.) I was struck by how much his voice has lost the patrician Boston Brahmin flavor it once had. Listen to him in 1971: the young lieutenant sounds like George Plimpton. That accent's largely gone now. I wonder if that's just a natural voice change brought about by living all this time in non-Brahmin D.C., or whether the Senator had to hire a speech coach to ditch the rare airs.

      GOOD TO SEE JOHN KERRY COMING AROUND (maybe)   on the subject of ANWR drilling.  Drilling for oil there isn't the answer to all our energy problems, but it's not nothing, and the environmental movement's "No! Never!" position was always ridiculous. When in God's name did the caribou's right to an untouched arctic wasteland become sacrosanct? Ahh, well. I have to admit, I wish that Kerry's latest flip-flop were motivated by something more noble than a desire to suck up to the Teamsters, but I suppose I'll take what I can get.   Now the real question: if he does make this flip, how will the enviros react?

      WENT TO SEE  DAVID BERNSTEIN , of  the Conspiracy  fame, at the law school today. He was giving a little lecture on his book, "You Can't Say That!", which is about the threat to civil liberties posed by antidiscrimination statutes. All-in-all, a nice presentation. I thought about asking him his opinions on the recent Conan O'Brien/Canada fracas, but I didn't want to impugn the dignity of those august proceedings with what was essentially a joke question. I was reminded, also, why I don't go to more Federalist Society events: we all dress alike. It's creepy: we're all in checkered flannel shirts and plain pants (jeans or khakis). It's nice that we're all so defiant in our rejection of the metrosexual Yale Law norm, but in the end it just looks like somebody cloned a scrawny lumberjack over and over and then gave all the clones copies of "The Road to Serfdom" to keep them occupied in the waiting room. Maybe it's just that I can't stand not being the worst-dressed man in the room: I have a certain Mr. Blackwell reputation to uphold.

      CONTRA COSTAS  Foolishly eschewing sleep, I watched some of the Mike Francesa show last night. He had on Bob Costas, hereafter to be known as That Arrogant Jerk Bob Costas, who was laying into The Trade. He was especially unkind to the Players' Association, which blocked a proposed trade of A-Rod to Boston on the grounds that it diminished the value of his contract. He went off about how the Curt Flood case was all about "freedom," but how now that A-Rod wanted the "freedom" to play for a winning team, and was willing to trade a few million for it, and the union had blocked it. He also declared the trade "bad for baseball" and announced that only people with a kind of myopic New Yorker provincialism could look upon this trade as anything other than a catastrophe. (Whereas, of course, a trade of A-Rod to baseball's second-richest team, the Red Sox, would have been an unqualified good.)  Well, call me a myopic New York provincial, but NYA-NYA-NYA...I think the trade was a good thing, for all involved. Maybe not for "baseball," but for all the actual parties actually involved in the trade.  The Yankees:  they got the best player in baseball.  Alex Rodriguez:  he gets to play for a contender for the first time in years, and finally gets to be a superstar in a big market, AND he gets to do it all without having to forego one cent of that ridiculous fat contract he signed.  The Rangers:  they dump huge amounts of salary,  and  get a superstar player who's more talented than the one they initially tried to trade for (Manny Ramirez) at a quarter the cost.  The Players' Association:  they got to preserve the principle that players can't negotiate to lower the value of their contracts, which I don't necessarily agree with but which I think is a reasonable position for a sports union trying to protect the negotiating power of its mid-level talent to take.  Did Boston lose? Of course. And you know why? Because they weren't willing to pony up an additional $15 million to land the best player in baseball, just about to hit his prime. ( c.f. today's Daily Quickie ) They have no-one to blame but themselves. They came up with the idea of trading for A-Rod. They can't blame the Yankees because they got cold feet at the altar. And they certainly can't blame the Yankees for looking at the almost-trade and thinking  hey, what a great idea...   Good for baseball?  Who cares?  Baseball isn't the Yankees' damn charity case. George Steinbrenner didn't write the rules,* he just uses them to win.  *In fact, the most recent set of rules was written, however ineffectively, to constrain George.

However,  those of us in New Haven, the birthplace of the Knights of Columbus, for Heaven's sake, will have to drive a-ways to see the film. What's the matter, Mel?

      I SAW THIS SKIT AND IT WAS HILARIOUS....for me to poop on!  Seriously, though, the Canadians are proving just how lame they are with this.  Trying to censor Triumph, the insult comic dog? You might as well try to tame the wind. You can silence the hand-puppet, but it won't change some basic facts. One: Canadians are more than a little dull. Two: Quebequois sepratism is one of the silliest political movements of the last half-century.  Goodnight. More drama tomorrow.

      THE FOX AND THE HOUND     The real me, Angus Dwyer, has a real friend from high school, Dave Rice, who operates a blog,  airdog . I meant to link to it earlier, but inexplicably did not. Well, now I have. It should also be on the links list now. Dave, for what it's worth, is the only white man (and man, is he white!) that I know who can dunk. Why this means you should be interested in his take on basketball, or other worldly matters, I don't know. Look, quit interrogating me, ok? Just click the damn link.

      A BRIEF RETURN TO THE SAME SEX MARRIAGE TOPIC  Reading  OxBlog , I was directed to  this article  by Yale Law's Lea Brilmayer. Obviously, Professor Brilmayer knows what she's talking about, far more than me, so I'm hesitant to criticize her work. That having been said, here I go.   First off, I've always been and remain skeptical of the claim that there's nothing to worry about with regards to gay marriage and the Full Faith & Credit clause, since the clause has never been construed to require that states give full faith and credit to marriages performed in other states that are contrary to the public policy of their state. States can set marriage rules with regard to consanguinity or minimum age, and can refuse to recognize out-of-state marriages performed contrary to those rules. I understand that this is true with regard to how things have been in the past. I'm just not especially confident that this is how things will remain. I don't want to get into a long monologue now, but my basic point is this: we're not talking about a 15-year-old couple married in Kentucky who'll have to wait two years before their marriage will be recognized in New York.* Everyone, I would think, agrees that there has to some minimum age at which people can marry (no European-royalty-style infant marriages in the U.S., no sir) and, given that states draft the marriage laws in this country, the issue of where to draw the line is left to them. They may come to different conclusions as to what age is appropriate, but no one argues that whatever line they draw is a valid exercise of the state police power. The 15-year-old newlyweds aren't claiming that they have a  right  to be married, not even under the Kentucky constitution. Same-sex marriage is different: the whole claim is that a regulation that bars them from marrying is an  invalid  exercise of the police power. They  are  claiming that they have a right to marry, not just that the arbitrarily drawn marriage statutes of their home state encompass them. I'm not saying that this is necessarily a legally more persuasive argument than the juvenile couple's. But it is, I think, rhetorically and morally more persuasive, and I wouldn't be shocked if it persuaded a court. Think of Brilmayer's own example of how a patchwork system would work: that of interracial marriages. She says this comparison "will surely make opponents of same sex marriage uncomfortable," which is doubtless true. But you know who else might find setting up a patchwork system where certain marriages were recognized in some states and not in others, solely on the grounds of a moral objection to the nature of those marriages, with all the disturbing parallels to interracial marriage before  Loving ? I dunno, maybe the judges who have to decide the FF&C issue? Is any judge really going to say to himself,  you know what? This patchwork system worked so well for interracial marriage, let's do it again.  Our reactions to the treatment (or even potential treatment) of Arab- and Muslim-Americans after September 11th was heavily influenced by our reaction to (and our disgust with) what happened in thus country during the Japanese interment. We believed our forebears had acted wrongly, and above all else, I think, we did not want to repeat their mistakes. Will the judges who hear these cases feel any differently about the sins of their judicial ancestors?  My other problem with the article, the one that initially prompted me to post, comes at the end, when she says that the political branches should drop the problem of trying to manage whether and how same sex marriages move through the states through mechanisms like the Defense of Marriage Act. The Supreme Court, I think she's arguing, can provide a "far more nuanced" mechanism for solving this problem, as it did with Nevada's easy divorce laws in the past. As a empirical matter I think she's probably right, but I'm going to protest any way since I see her solution as one more step in the judicialization of the American government. One of the country's biggest latent problems is the willingness of people on all sides to use the courts as a forum of first resort in what are essentially political struggles. Can't get the state to issue you and your same-sex partner a marriage license? Don't start lobby to get the law changed in the legislature: sue! Can't get state funding for your education as a divinity student because the state has a "Blaine" amendment in its constitution? Don't start a movement to repeal the amendment: sue! Upset that your state's public university is using a race-conscious affirmative action program in admissions? Don't try to change the law through referendum or the legislature, or try to get the administration replaced with people who won't use such a system: sue! After all, why should we care what the legislatures have to say? It's not like they're the democratically elected representatives of the people, or anything. Now, I'm not advocating an end to judicial review, or anything like that. I'd just like to see a little judicial arms control. Can we agree to at least  try  to settle issues in the ordinary political process before we resort to using the courts? Don't do it for me. Do it for John Hart Ely.      You know, every time I try to say a brief word about same-sex marriage, I wind up rambling on forever. Proves me a liar. But, o intrepid reader, if you've made it this far I have a burried-lead present to reward you with. Today I proved those who called me "utterly unemployable" at least a little wrong. I got a job for the summer at the New Haven state's attorney's office, Geographic Area #23 (GO 23! WOOOOOOO! Geographic Area pride!). So if you're a non-violent drug offender or a speeder in the city of New Haven, consider yourself warned: come June 1, your reign of terror is over. There's a new sheriff in town, and he's a Fox.**  *These numbers and states are arbitrary and invented, mostly because I'm too lazy to do a little research. So sue me.  **Note: the Fox is not actually going to be a sheriff. He's just an intern. But he's not a damn fox either.

      AHHH! I'VE BEEN BUMPED BACK TO 2004! It seems a lame non-story story  about the somewhat unusual distribution pattern for Mel Gibson's crucifixion epic  The Passion of the Christ   has pulled me back to the present. It seems the distributors have decided to open their movie heavily in the Bible Belt and in areas with large Roman Catholic and African-American populations, but to eschew areas "that are considered Jewish, upscale, or liberal." This seems to me a sensible business move. Gibson & Co. have made a movie that they think will appeal to some communities and not to others. So they focus their release in areas where they think they have the largest audience, and avoid areas where they think they won't be able to recoup their investment. Does anyone really think that there was going to be a huge audience on the Upper West Side for a movie that uncritically accepts the Gospel accounts of the death of Jesus, that treats them as truth (rather than, say,  urlLink a Pauline deception designed to cover the real Existentialist truth, or somesuch )? There's no natural right to have a movie open in your neighborhood (and frankly I find the article's suggestion that it's a huge indignity for people on the Upper West Side to have to trudge down to Times Square a little laughable. If I want to see the movie, I have to drive to damn Orange, or Bridgeport.) Maybe I'm just blind to the sinister anti-Semetic conspiracy here, but this just seems like good business sense to me.   OK, well I'm back in the year 2004. Hopefully I don't get thrust back into the past somehow. And I'd have to say that, looking at my material surroundings, I probably didn't teach my past-self how to make crazy-money in the internet stock bubble. Where's my Mazaratti, damnit?!?

I'm stuck in New England, the weather's awful, I've got too many unread books on my bookshelf, I've got the same set of sheets I'll have in 2004 (green flannel XL twin: those sumbitches will last you a damn lifetime). My internet connection is somewhat faster than I recall it being, but that's about it. Hopefully, I can figure out a way to get back to my own time, but not before I make a little money.

      SO A BUNCH OF WOMEN ARE PUTTING UP POSTERS in my Criminal Law classroom advertising for an upcoming speech by  Kate Michelman  (of NARAL fame) at Yale. A guy, who like me is dawdling around before class starts, strikes up a conversation (reproduced as best I can):  Man: "Oh, is Kate Michelman coming to speak here?" Woman (cutely sarcastic): "What makes you think that?" Man: "I dunno, I guess all the signs about 'choice'." ( pause ) Man: "So what's she speaking about?"  At this point, I start quietly wheeze-laughing, as I am apt to do.  What's she speaking about?  I dunno, tax policy? Deregulation of the airlines? Suppression of political dissent in Kyrgyzstan?   Woman: "Oh, the right to choose, defending a woman's right to choose, and such."    Whew! Dodged a close one there.

And Times, of course, is ubiquitous, and deservedly so. But Courier is a classic. It's the font of our ancestors, the font of the typewriter, of the telegraph. Dare I say it? It's the font that defeated the Nazis. And it's a shame to see it go. Good-night, sweet font, and flights of pixels sing thee to thy rest. (Link via  Zorak the Embittered Mantis )

      MMMMM....COOKIES.... Another affirmative-action bake sale  at the University of Colorado. Maybe it's just me, but hasn't the idea of the affirmative-action bake sale "jumped the shark"? At first, the idea was clever and subversive: a way for opponents of affirmative action to make a theoretical point (about the wrongness of treating people differently based only on their race) in a concrete way that everyone could understand. But now, I dunno, the whole thing just seems  tired . I suppose if you've never heard of the phenomenon then maybe, as NBC used to say, "it's new to you." But as for me, I feel like I've heard about every damn one of these things since the first one. Maybe the problem is the constant use of bake sales. Couldn't it be an affirmative-action car wash, or an affirmative-action "massage parlor"? (Now  that  would cause a stir!) And in this Atkins-friendly world we're living in, aren't cookies too heavy on the carbs? What if we have affirmative-action steakhouses instead? And don't some people with eating disorders also favor racial preferences? Why not affirmative-action hard-boiled eggs and celery sales? C'mon people! Creativity!

      MY BOY AT HARVARD LAW  My old professor, Hadley Arkes, will be debating same-sex marriage at the other law school tonight.  Go, H-diddy! If you're in the Boston area, you should drop in. Just hearing the guy speak is an experience: his voice and style of speaking anything you've ever heard before, I promise you. A side note: if a "debate" between two opponents of same-sex marriage seems a little one-sided to you, know that I'm with you. But it's not their fault:  Human Rights Campaign, the pro-SSM side, dropped out in order to focus on lobbying the legislature.

      MY BOY'S BOY AT AMHERST   Justice Scalia is coming to speak at my alma mater tomorrow.  And it's getting  protested by the faculty.  And the whole thing's been mentioned in  the Corner.  Well, at least they've just decided not to come. The last time Scalia was at Amherst, there was an incident. It was Commencement Weekend 2002. Scalia's daughter Meg was graduating, so the Justice was going to be on campus anyway, and Professor Arkes asked him to give an informal talk to some of his students. (By which I mean of course his brainwashed Arkes-head acolytes. Full disclosure: I was one of those Arkes-heads, and remain a semi-active member in the informal Arkes-head alumni association). So Scalia gave a little talk in a packed-to-the-gills classroom. I can't remember the subject of the speech exactly, but I recall it being relatively innocuous, a discussion, I think, of his general theory of jurisprudence. Then, about halfway through his talk, something very odd happened. A little man with oily hair who had been sitting in the front row stood up and started to talk. He said: "I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think it's only fair since you interrupted the election" in 2000, or something to that effect. He then proceeded to bait Scalia for a minute or so. Scalia, to his credit, handled the situation with grace and class, and as I recall was actually willing to engage the heckler with questions. Arkes eventually got up and said, in effect:  sir, this was not intended as a public debate but as a conversation between the Justice and my students. If you want you can ask questions at the end, if there's time, but my students get first crack.   (I will not even attempt to recreate the Professor's unique style of speaking. No mortal man, I think, could do such a thing.) Now, up until that point, I'd just assumed the heckler was some local left-winger with an axe to grind and a free afternoon (of which Amherst has a genuine surplus), and it wasn't until he replied to Professor Arkes' suggestion that he hold his questions until the end that I realized who he was. He said, snidely, "I'm sorry, I have to go. I'm receiving an honorary degree this afternoon." Our heckler was film-maker  David O. Russell  '81E, who for having directed 3 motion pictures, including the classic  Spanking the Monkey , was being given an honorary degree that afternoon. (Scalia, whose lame CV is restricted to having been a law professor, a circuit court judge, and an associate Supreme Court justice, did not receive one.) Russell then stormed out of the room, with an associate of some kind in tow (do Hollywood types ever travel alone? Seriously?) and went off to give his talk (honorary degree recipients are expected to give informal talks about their lives and work). I've no doubt that he felt he'd struck a crushing blow against the forces of evil conservatism, but it looked to the rest of us that he'd just exposed himself as a whiny, arrogant prick. (For the record, I thought  Three Kings  was pretty cool, but never saw any of his other movies and now, for some reason, no longer feel the desire to.)  Oh, I almost forgot the story's charming post-script (which I only know second hand, but I think it's trustworthy). Russell's talk was in large part about his experience at Amherst, how studying with  Robert Thurman  (Uma's dad! [hubba-hubba]) had led him to Buddhism and the way of non-violence. One of the students at the talk, who knew (I'm not sure how) what Russell had done during Scalia's talk asked him how he could reconcile his belief in non-violence and non-confrontation with the way he'd treated Scalia. Naturally, Russell had no good answer, and just kind of stumbled about for a bit, trying unsuccessfully to justify himself, until he moved on. What a day, what a day.

      GO CATS! Hosting a Super Bowl party this afternoon. Rooting feverishly against the Patriots and their evil necromancer* of a coach Bill Belichick. My keg is cold. My wings are warm. The Panthers' front four is very, very scary. This could turn out to be a sweet night.   *I'm currently operating on the theory that Belichick has made common cause with dark forces and used them to summon and imprison the spirits of Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry, who he's forcing to draw up his game plans. Think about it: he went from being a mediocre coach in Cleveland to some kind of scary unstoppable genius in New England. These things don't just happen! Plus he wears a hood, all the time. And I think I saw the witch of Endor at the 50-yard line in the championship game. I'm telling you, people: he's the Faust of the gridiron.

      BEST POLITICAL ADS: MADE BY AMATEURS. I agree with  Jonah Goldberg :  this Bush ad is pretty good.  It's a positive ad, but one that's substantive rather than maudlin. It probably needs to be cleaned up a little bit, but other than a few font improvements, I think it's basically an ad you could run on television tomorrow.  The quality of the ad reminds me of the  "Child's Pay"  ad that one the MoveOn.org contest a while back. I'm always amazed: politicians spend millions, and get ads of equal or lesser quality to what can be produced by a few motivated amateurs.

      WHY IS JOE BIDEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE DEMOCRATS? Well, for one:  He's happy to stick it to the Euros when necessary.  (Link via  Instapundit .)     In looking eternally inward, Biden said, the European Union's leading members had for the most part had taken their eye off the ball about the rest of the world. Europeans misguidedly tended to regard the United States as an imperial power, he added. And their leaders offered no really constructive alternatives to the Iraq war.  Recalling that he had talked to six European government chiefs about the war, Biden caricatured how they would have done things better. "Blah blah blah, international cooperation," the senator mimicked. He added, in his own voice, "Give me a break, huh."  When Biden offered the possibility, beyond more civility, of a future in contrast to the Bush administration, it was in a plague-on-your-houses context. He said of the two, Europe and Bush, "You have fallen in love with international institutions to the extent that this administration has fallen in love with unilateral action."  For good measure, Biden threw in the view that the European Union will not have a unified foreign policy, and with it, the phrase, "I hope you do, I wish you well, but I see no evidence you're going to spend the money needed" to create a serious European military force either.    If it is in fact true that a Kerry Administration wouldn't just roll over and give the Euros whatever they want (and it probably is), then it's good to let them know ahead of time. I'd hate for them to go ga-ga for Ol' Botox only to discover next January that it's "meet the new boss, same as the old boss."

      THE OTHER TOURNAMENT THIS MONTH  Old Oligarch  links to Modern Drunkard's  "Clash of the Tightest" tournament.  See? This is why the internet is so great. To be honest, I would have had Churchill over Richard Burton in the first round, but then again, I had the Southern Illinois Salukis over the "Elite Eight"-bound Crimson Tide in the first round too, so what do I know?

       VERY INTERESTING ARTICLE ON ARAB CHRISTIANS IN THE UNITED STATES.  It seems that, among other things, they still constitute 70% of Arab immigrants to the United States. Anyway, go read it if you have a few minutes. Fascinating look into an subject I didn't know anything about. (Link via  Fr. Jim )

      ONLY IN AMERICA! The RNC has a flash game on it's website,  featuring John Kerry boxing himself.  (It's a joke about his flip-flops.  Get it?!? ) The game is very so-so, but it does have one cool feature: the voice of the announcer is none other than Don King.  The  Don King. The  actual  Don King. How cool is that?

      IT'S A GOOD THING AMERICANS DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICS  There's an interesting piece at Opinion Journal  criticizing Professor Ackerman's proposal to start celebrating "Deliberation Day", a holiday in which Americans will get paid $150 a pop (at taxpayer expense) to get educated ( re-educated? ) about issues of public concern. Like Mr. Conway, I'm skeptical of the "Deliberation Day" proposal. I especially agree with this sentiment:   Maybe the political indifference or ignorance of the average American is not at root a vice in our national life but a virtue, a product of a mild politics. One notes that Bosnians and Serbs, Hutus and Tutsis, could easily consider political apathy a blessing; that despite its many flaws, America's political system invokes envy and inspires imitation around the world. It certainly affords its citizens more liberties than any system that came before it, including the liberty--most of the time--to pay more attention to, say, a child's soccer game or the NCAA tourney than to John Kerry's latest nuanced position on Sarbanes-Oxley.   Hear, hear. One of the greatest freedoms Americans enjoy is the freedom not to give a rat's ass about any given subject. Care more about college basketball or doll-house collecting than politics? Go nuts, big guy.

      FOREIGN LEADERS NOT FOREIGN?  Drudge is reporting  that a transcription error caused Kerry's claim to have spoken to "more leaders" to be mis-transcribed as "foreign leaders".  Like Professor Reynolds,  I'm skeptical. In the mini-firestorm that's followed his remarks, Kerry hasn't defended himself by saying "I was misquoted" but rather by saying by saying that what he had said wasn't any of our business. Maybe he's just being an aloof jerk. But it seems more plausible to me that even if he said "more leaders" he really meant "foreign leaders," that he was quoted accurately as to the substance of his statements, even as he was misquoted as to the specifics.

I'd avoided the movie for years, but now, stuck home on a slow Monday night, I've been pulled in. Do you realize what this movie is about? Did the retarded giant just use his mystical powers to cure Tom Hanks' erectile dysfunction? And did he do it by grabbing his crotch? Forget about Janet Jackson; how can we get  this  filth off television?

      WHO ARE THOSE FOREIGN LEADERS who've privately endorsed Kerry?  There's been some chatter in the blogosphere  about Kerry's "That's none of your business." response to that question, posed to him by a Bush sympathizer at a town hall meeting recently.  It's perfectly reasonable to ask Kerry that kind of question, and to criticize him when he gives a rude non-response response. You can't offer as a selling-point for your candidacy that you've been privately endorsed by various foreign leaders and then refuse to tell the American people who those leaders are.   The foreign-leader endorsements are part of a larger campaign promise by the Kerry camp - that he'll repair our frayed alliances with Europe and the rest of the world. The secret endorsements are apparently evidence of  how  Kerry will do that: foreign leaders like him better than Bush, whom they despise, and will be more willing to deal with him (and his mellow multilateralism).   Because the secret endorsements are a substantive claim in defense of a campaign promise, people have a right to some specifics. Are these world leaders the heads of important countries? (No offense to Togo, but President Gnassingbe Eyadema's endorsement shouldn't make-or-break the 2004 election.) Are they the leaders of enemies the United States, like North Korea or Iran? (I doubt they are, by the way.) Are they the leaders of ostensibly allied states that many Americans find incredibly irritating, often for no rational reason? (I'm looking at you, Jacques Chirac.)  These are important details, which when provided will provide the voters a means to evaluate the strength of Kerry's larger promise that he'll repair our frayed alliances. Withholding it would be like proposing to spend $900 billion more on healthcare, cut the deficit in half and only raise taxes by $250 billion, without explaining the source of the other $650 billion. You know, the kind of bush-league bullshit the Kerry Campaign would never dream of pulling.  That said, there are plenty of good reasons Kerry wouldn't want to reveal who those foreign leaders who've privately endorsed him are. It would probably hurt him more than it helps him to be known as the official candidate of Jacques Chirac and the Fifth French Republic. There's also the problem of confirming his claims. Whoever he names, not wanting between 9 months and 5 years of icy relations with the Bush Administration, might deny ever endorsing Kerry, thus making the Senator look like a liar. Also, the endorsement may indeed have been made in confidence, which the Senator, being a decent guy, would not want to violate.  Of course, all of these reasons just underscore how dumb it was for Kerry to go off about how foreign leaders had told him they wanted him to win in the first place. It should've been obvious at the time that these kinds of questions would follow. If he didn't want to answer them, he shouldn't've brought up the topic. Kerry let this particular genie out of it's bottle. He can't complain when it wants to play 20 questions. (Talk about your mixed metaphors!)    By the way (bonus final graph): I can't see how the "foreign leaders endorse Kerry" meme hurts Bush much. Most Americans already have a sense that the Europeans don't care for Bush, just like they didn't care for his ideological predecessor Reagan. I can think of two scenarios in which this hurts Bush. One is if a large number of foreign leaders (and not just European ones or ones that are known to be anti-Bush or anti-US) come out openly against Bush's reelection. I'm taking Russia, India, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, Ireland, etc. That would wound, but probably not fatally. The other scenario:  if the leader who'd secretly endorsed Kerry were Tony Blair.  I can't see how that's anything other than a fatal wound to the Bush reelection bid. If Tony the Tiger would rather play ball with J. Forbes Kerry, and is willing to say so publicly, Bush is toast.

      DON SENSING ON GAY MARRIAGE  "Opponents of legalized same-sex marriage say they're trying to protect a beleaguered institution, but they're a little late. The walls of traditional marriage were breached 40 years ago; what we are witnessing now is the storming of the last bastion."  I basically agree with Sensing's analysis. The question, though, is: what is to be done?   I sense that Sensing is essentially suggesting preemptive surrender by the forces of tradition. Given how much has already been lost, that's not an unreasonable position. If this were an actual war, instead of a metaphoric one, it would be a hard position to argue with: it's hard to ask anyone to be the last to die for a doomed cause.  On the other hand, given that traditionalists have (at least in the short term) a maybe 50-50 chance of holding that last bastion, shouldn't they dig in and try to hold on, with the hope that it might someday serve as a base from which to launch a counter-assault.   It probably won't work: even I have a hard time imagining that we're ever going to recover the sexual mores of the eighteenth century (and I have a pretty vivid imagination). But it's not impossible. Don't give me that Whig School of history crap; inevitable upwards march of progress, my ass. And if what's been lost is really as important as Sensing seems to think it is (and he does say "I believe that this state of affairs is contrary to the will of God."), isn't it at least worth a try? As Henry Hyde said, of a different issue, "When the time comes, as it surely will, when we face that awesome moment, the Final Judgment ... God will look at us and say not, 'Did you succeed?' but rather, 'Did you try?'" Or, to quote a different thinker, Sarah Connor, who faced a similarly impossible-seeming challenge,  "No fate but what we make."

      WHY DO I LIKE THE YANKEES THIS YEAR? (Other than all the other reasons?) Two words: bench strength. I'm watching the Yanks-Braves spring training game right now. The Yanks brought three of their regular starters to Orlando: Sheffield, Matsui, and Enrique Wilson. The rest of the lineup was spare parts: Tony Clark, Darren Bragg, Miguel Castro, Mike Lamb, and John Flaherty. The Yankees nevertheless put up four runs on six hits (all singles) in the first off of Mike Hampton. This suggests to me that the bench players can hit, which is a very good thing for the team. They're also (with the exception of Mike Lamb, who's not going to make the roster anyway) good defensively. This kind of bench strength bodes very well: it mitigates the damage from injuries to starters, it allows you to pinch-run and put in defensive replacements late in the game more confidently. It's been a while since I've felt this good about the Yankees bench. Combine that with an all all-star starting lineup and a pretty-damn-fine pitching staff, and we're in good shape.

      POKER NIGHT AT THE LAW SCHOOL Eesh. I got shit cards and played with a strategic vision worthy of Douglas Haig at the Somme, so I was the first out. Ehh, I wasn't using those $10 anyway.   Later that night I dreamt I was part of an illegal poker circuit that was eventually joined by Rafael Palmeiro. We had to kill Palmeiro, who in addition to being a card cheat was apparently passing government secrets to the Cubans. The rest of the dream was spent trying to dispose of the body. We eventually traded it to a coked-up heiress along with a  haute couture  dress we'd somehow come into possession of.   If there's a lesson in all this I think I've missed it

      THE MADNESS OF BILL OF RIGHTS INCORPORATION  Doing my reading for Criminal Procedure just now, I was reminded of one of my top con law pet peeves: the utterly incomprehensible manner in which parts of the Bill of Rights has been held to apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Let's assume that you agree that the Fourteenth Amendment applies some, but not all, of the protections of the Bill of Rights to the states. Under current doctrine, the First Amendment, which you'll recall begins " Congress  shall make no law..." (emphasis added),  is  incorporated. At the same time, the Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement ("No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger") is not incorporated. Does this make any sense?   Under a "plain meaning" analysis, the Fifth Amendment's grand jury requirement would seem to apply to the states even in the absence of the Fourteenth Amendment (something that can't be said of the First Amendment). And yet, under today's constitutional doctrine, not only does it not apply to the states on its own, it's one of the few provisions of the Bill of Rights not incorporated against the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.   Is there some compelling logical argument I'm missing here? Or do we just like a little crazy in our constitutional law framework?

      BILL CLINTON, THE VICE PRESIDENCY & AMENDMENTS XII AND XXII  Over at the Conspiracy,  Professor Volokh rejoins the fray over whether Clinton would eligible to serve as John Kerry's vice president.  He thinks he's not; others think he is. I'm inclined to agree with Professor Volokh, but what do I know?  My question: who cares? Not to dis people who make their livings as legal academics, but isn't this debate a bit, er, academic? Lets say, hypothetically, that Clinton does join Kerry on the Democratic ticket. Lets say they win. To quote "Dude, Where's My Car",  and then?  There'll be a lawsuit? Who has standing to sue? Bush? Is the Supreme Court actually going to invalidate Clinton's election to the vice presidency on the grounds that it violates the Twelfth and Twenty-Second Amendments? (Just like they invalidated Hugo Black's appointment on the grounds that it violated Article I, Section 6?) Isn't this a quintessential political question? Are the constitutional requirements for officeholding, or at least the presidency, judicially enforceable?  What if a person is elected president when he's 34, but will turn 35 before he's sworn in? Is that person "eligible" for the office of president under Article II, Section 1? Doesn't it matter that the people presumptively considered the issue and decided it didn't disqualify the candidate? What if the people decided a 33-year-old was "good enough"? I'm not saying these aren't violations of the Constitution. What I am saying is: do we want the Supreme Court essentially deposing duly elected presidents?

But: let's look on the bright side. This takes the Yankees down a notch offensively. But scoring runs wasn't going to be their big problem this year. And, assuming Bernie Williams recovers OK from his appendectomy, this may actually improve the team defensively while Sheffield is out. Giambi will DH, Bernie will play right field, Lofton will play center and the glovetastic Travis Lee will play first. That's a better defensive lineup than the Sheff-in-right/Giambi-at-first/Bernie-DH/Lofton-in-center lineup the team was planning on. And a batting order of Lofton-Jeter-Rodriguez-Giambi-Posada-Matsui-Williams-Lee-Wilson is still going to score a great many runs.

      PRISON RAPE: REALLY, REALLY NOT FUNNY Over in The Corner,  Andrew Stuttaford  links to an article in Yale Law's own  Legal Affairs  on  prison rape in the United States.  It's a good piece, which you should read when you have the chance. An old boss of mine, Eli Lehrer, once described prison rape as the biggest systematic civil rights violation in the United States today ( see more of his thoughts on the topic here ). I don't know if that's true, though it's certainly plausible. Prison rape is a real problem for the country, one that (as Stuttaford says) challenges our vision of how civilized we are as a society. I find myself particularly galled by how easy it is for otherwise good, humane people (in which I count myself, alas) to think of the rapes endured in prison as naturally part-and-parcel of the punishment we visit on criminals. They're not. They're a massive and cruel injustice, one that we abet if we don't do our utmost to stop it.  What I hate most is that, in spite of myself, I find prison rape funny.   Half Baked   is funny, as are many of the other movies that use prison rape, or the fear of prison rape for comic effect. (It's not just prison rape either; think of the scene in which Seabass rapes Lloyd in   Dumb and Dumber  .)  We would rightly consider it appalling to joke about a man raping a woman. But when Nasty Nate threatens to take his "cocktail....FRUIT!" from Kenny, or when Cam Neely makes Jim Carrey "find a happy place", we laugh. (Perhaps you're chuckling now.) I don't know why we react so differently; I just wish we didn't.

      HOW SHOULD WE RELATE TO OUR PETS?  There's a really good piece by Jon Katz over at Slate on the pet owner / companion-animal guardian debate.  This topic came up a couple of times, obliquely, in my constitutional law class. I'm inclined to agree with Mr. Katz that obscuring the line between humans and animals, treating pets as "'people' of another species", is a very bad idea. Katz argues that treating pets like humans leads people to treat them in ways that are wildly inappropriate for animals (overfeeding them, not training them properly, refusing to euthanize them). For my part, I think the problem cuts the other way as well: I think equating humans and animals is just as likely to lead people to treat humans in a way once thought appropriate only for animals as the other way around, and that's far more dangerous (for us at least, and that's what I care about) in the long term. It may just be a coincidence that the modern euthanasia movement developed simultaneously with the late 20th century move to treat pets as family members rather than, well, pets, but I'm inclined to think they're at least partially related. I mean: if Rover is a member of the family, and when Rover is old and in interminable pain we put him to sleep. Grandpa is a member of the family too; he's old and in interminable pain.... Or chemical castration of sex offenders; are we more likely to consider that option because we have no problem neutering our companion animals?  Of course, I'm an anthro-supremacist - no doubt a relic of an passing age - so what do I know?

      TALK ABOUT YOUR LACK OF MENS REA Well, I learned a valuable lesson tonight. If you go to the grad student bar, and it's karaoke night, make damn sure before you sit on anything that it can support your weight. Specifically: the backs of futons may not be strong enough. It does not matter how many futons you've sat upon in how many unorthodox ways; if you sit on the back of one futon in the middle of a heart-felt rendition of "You Shook Me All Night Long" and it, say, collapses under your prodigious girth, you're toast. The people at GPSCY may be nice and say they won't make you pay for it; you may try to claim "It wasn't Angus Dwyer: it was Angus  Young , dammit!"; but at the end of the day you're the fat-ass that took the grad-students' pub down from three futons to two, and you're the one that collapsed on the floor in a humiliating sea of cheap wood planks and threadbare mattresses. And no amount of self-deprecating humor can erase that.

      OF COMMUNISTS AND WITCHES   Over at the Conspiracy , Eugene Volokh says:  "At the same time, I balk at casual condemnations of McCarthyism as a "witch hunt." Witch hunts are unambiguously bad because  we know there are no witches.  If there were witches, in the standard sense of people who could use black magic to harm the rest of us, then of course we ought to hunt them."  I concur. That said, the problem with McCarthyism isn't that there weren't any witches. It's that McCarthy and HUAC weren't any good at catching them, and their bluster and bullying distracted from any actual efforts at witch hunting and did much to discredit the very idea of witch hunting for future generations. When there are witches in our midst, or genuine subversives in the service of some foreign power, by all means they should be uncovered and prevented from doing us harm. But ruining the lives of innocent people for political gain or just out of spite (Roy Cohn, anybody?) doesn't help us do that, it hurts us.  I'm sure Professor Volokh probably agrees with that; I'm not trying to criticize him. I just think it's always worthwhile whenever McCarthy comes up to remember why McCarthyism actually was bad.  PS - If you scroll up at the Volokh site, there's more in-depth discussion of the philosophical problems that would be cause by the actual existence of witches (and also of telepaths). The web is such a strange, strange place.  PPS - I actually do (sort of) believe in witches. I figure I believe in lots of other kooky things that can't be empirically verified using the scientific method - the soul, God, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, angels, demons - why not toss witches into the mix? (Plus they're  in the Bible! ) I don't exactly stay up nights worrying about them - I figure they can't do me any harm in the long run - but I wouldn't be shocked if it turned out they're still around.

First of all, it's only tangentially a murder case; it's principally about a prosecution trial. More importantly, it's filmed in a very different style, and has a very different tone, than later episodes. Much less naturalistic lighting, and far more theatrical in general. Also, a much lower quality of acting than in later episodes. And, worst of all: there's no "doink-doink" in between the scenes, nor the little datelines. I'd always assumed that L&O had it's trademark tics from the get-go. Apparently they developed organically as the show progressed. Fascinating.

      HORRIFYING, UTTERLY HORRIFYING  This news  is just sickening. These people should be punished to the fullest extent that the Uniform Code of Military Justice permits. In addition to being ridiculously counter-productive in terms of our larger goals in Iraq, it's just plain evil. Remember how the barbarism of the Iraqi regime - the "rape rooms" et alia - was part of the justification for invading the country? ugh.    ( More disturbing pictures are available here. )

      HE'S OUT! Yanks robbed of an out in the sixth. Bobby Kielty "beats out" a wimpy, wimpy grounder. It's a shame, too, because it was a great off-balance throw from Posada, and an even better catch from Giambi. Believe me, Giambi needs every great defensive play he can get.

      OOOOO, MUQTADA! Things don't look so hot for everybody's favorite radical Shi'a cleric / would-be theocrat.  Widely despised in his erstwhile city of refuge,  Muqtada al-Sadr is showing increasing signs that he's not, in fact, the next Khomeini. Which strikes me as good news for just about everyone, American and Iraqi, who isn't al-Sadr himself. Doubtless I'm being especially Pollyannaish, but this guy seems like he's got "footnote-bound" written all over him: history will remember Muqtada al-Sadr as the last gasp of tyranny before the non-crazies took over and established some form of liberal, consensual government. One wonders, though: will al-Sadr be remembered as  Karl Doenitz , or as  Eugen Levine ? That is: is this really the last gasp, or will the the following period of liberal-democratic calm be merely a prelude to a big hocking up of the phlegm of tyranny? (How's  that  for a metaphor?) Man, I hope it's the latter.   (Also, I hope  this  makes things better, rather than worse.)

      YESTERDAY WAS A GOOD DAY. In the morning, I started  Love in the Ruins  (courtesy of Cross-Campus Library) which I'd meant to do for a while. Then I had lunch at Mory's with  Old Oligarch  and  Zorak the Embittered Mantis , who were in town for various sinister doings. It was nice to get to meet them. I wish I'd had more interesting things to say, but alas, as you might have guessed from reading this blog, I'm not a terribly interesting person.    After lunch I went to a bbq further up on Mansfield Street. That too was a good time. The people who'd taken the  Journal  entrance exam were celebrating their having finished the exam. The people who hadn't (I like to call them smart people) were celebrating their not having taken it. Burgers, dogs, brauts, beers, sangria, frisbe, football, a pit-bull in a tu-tu (don't ask): an excellent way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  Then it was on to my final obligation of the day: tending bar at the  Divinity School 's spring formal. And by "tending bar" I mean "serving people beer and wine". I tried to get hard liquor for the event, but the organizers shot me down (not unreasonably, I suppose). I guess my  Mr. Boston  will have to continue to gather dust for a little while longer.  The Div School prom was the highlight of my day. I really love tending bar; couldn't tell you why, exactly: it just feels right. Maybe someday I can be like NBC's  Ed ,  with a bar instead of a bowling alley. Probably not, though. Those kinds of things don't happen in real life.  Anyway, enough melancholia: the prom was fun. It was in a park on the west side of the harbor called Lighthouse Point. There was a DJ and dancing  and an indoor carousel . I cannot stress how strange that was. People were riding it all night long. Unspeakably strange. (Full disclosure: I tried it at the end of the night.)  So it was a good time, and an excellent cap to a great day.   Today? Eh, not so hot. Perhaps it'll get better, but I suspect today is just the kind of day when things go badly. Ah, well.

      MEMO TO STEINBRENNER: Can we lay off the next hot Cuban emigre prospect?  Please?  El Duque was fun and all, but these guys all have a ton of baggage and there's no reliable metric to convert Cuban national league statistics into Major League potential. Am I the only one who looks at Jose Contreras and says, "This guy's the Cuban Hideki Irabu."? The money you pour into the next bidding contest for some can't-miss Cuban could be much better spent scouting in American colleges and high schools.  Think about the best young pitchers: Barry Zito, Mark Mulder, Tim Hudson, Dontrelle Willis, Roy Oswalt, Kerry Wood, Mark Prior, Carlos Zambrano, Kip Wells, Javier Vazquez, Josh Beckett, Brad Penny, Eric Gagne, Roy Halladay (to construct an incomplete list). What's the common denominator? Well, none of them are Cubans. And all but Vazquez, Zambrano and Gagne are Americans (and Vazquez is a Puerto Rican). Scott Proctor is the big Yankees pitcher-to-be. Make him the model, too. Scouting and astute trades = good. Throwing money at aging foreign superstars = questionable.   Note: I started writing this post before Contreras gave up back-to-back homers to Millar and Bellhorn, and got hooked in the fourth.

      IT'S KIND OF A DUMB POINT,  but it's worth mentioning, perhaps, that Dubya should be denied communion, too.  Y'know, 'cause he's not a Catholic.    To quote Lisa Simpson, "I'm no theologian." My analysis of the situation may be wrong (please correct me if it is). But:  It seems to me that Kerry ought to be denied communion, for his own sake. He's a major public figure, advocating a position of neutrality towards grave sin. That seems like scandal to me. (c.f., Pius XII:  they are guilty of scandal who establish laws or social structures leading to the decline in morals... ) John Kerry, by his words and deeds, helps lead others into grave sin; as such, he himself is in a state of mortal sin.  If he continues to receive the Eucharist while in a state of mortal sin, he compounds his folly by adding to scandal the sin of sacrilege (c.f., 1 Corinthians 11:27-29). As such, even if Kerry is a virtuous man in all other respects (and I've no reason to doubt he is), he's locked in a self-perpetuating cycle of mortal sin. For the sake of his soul, he needs to get out of it.   Kerry shouldn't be receiving communion, for his own sake. If he can't take care of himself, the bishops ought to do it for him ("feed my sheep" and all that). It won't be pretty, and it won't be fun, but it might be the kind of slap-in-the-face wake-up call that leads him to renounce his sinful ways. Look: I'm not holding my breath. But I have hope.     PS: I'm not blind to the political ramifications of all this. But that's besides the point. Elections come and go; empires rise and fall. What's at stake here is the immortal soul of John Forbes Kerry. No number of electoral votes is worth more than that.

Two outs (Uribe struck out to lead off the bottom of the inning).  But then: Konerko, unable to hit into a double play, singles to center instead. 8-3 Yanks.  And then:  Gload doubles to the right field corner, scoring Konerko. 8-4 Yanks.  Aaaaaand: it's raining again.

      AND WE'RE BACK! The delay is over. The YES announcers are suggesting, correctly, that the umps are trying to get the five innings over with, in case the rains return, and they've expanded the strike zone to do it. At this rate, Graman could get a pick-off move called for a strike.   OK, the Yanks went down in order in the top of the 3rd. Now it's Graman v. Ordonez, round 2.

Kruk says it was selfish of A-Rod to bunt against a left-hander with Giambi (who's veddy weak against lefties) coming up, and that it was girly-man baseball for the Yanks to play for one run in the first. Reynolds is arguing that your #3 should be able to do everything, including bunt if needed, and that, besides, it worked: A-Rod got on and eventually scored, and the Yankees wound up scoring seven runs. Where can I get some action on a Reynolds-Kruk title fight?

      THE GRAND INQUISITOR ASKS: Is it just me, or is there something not-quite-right about  this image ? I mean, it's Christ on the Cross, except he's not exactly  on  the cross. It seems like kind of mish-mash of the Crucifixion and the Ascension. Can't say, exactly, but something about it set off my heterodoxometer. 'Course, my 'doxometer has a bit of a hair-trigger - that's one of my major character flaws (the others being laziness, gluttony, intemperance and lack of self-control). Perhaps I should refer the matter to a member of the Church Militant with a higher pay-grade, like  Old Oligarch.

      I GET IT, I GET IT: I CAN'T SPELL! Last word on the antediluvian/antedeluvian/antideluvian controversy. The correct spelling is "antediluvian". My initial (wrong) spelling was "antedeluvian", not "antideluvian", as I mistakenly suggested in my first correction.  Chalk this up to a mixture of lack of natural spelling ability and the hurried hand with which one posts corrections during one's legislation class. Blogging is as much an art as an art as a science, but it seems of late I've been a little too much  Jackson Pollack  and not enough  Piet Mondrian . I shall endeavor to be more careful in the future.

      HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLIND? Reader BHW correctly points out that "Waterworld" is not, as a definitional matter, "antediluvian". (He also points out that it's not spelled "antideluvian".) The correct term, I suppose, would be "postdiluvian". Or perhaps just "diluvian". Anyway, I should think twice in the future before throwing around five-dollar words.

No doubt part of my general fondness for apocalyptic fiction. My favorite, of course, is the genre's "Hamlet" -  "A Canticle for Liebowitz"  - but even the genre's minor lights tickle my fancy.

      A LITTLE SSM BEFORE I GO-GO. On CSPAN right now is a rerun of Wednesday's Boston University debate on gay marriage. A few thoughts before I run out for a drink.    * My old prof, Hadley Arkes, was there as the professorial voice on the anti-gay marriage side. I love to hear Hadley speak, which was why I stopped surfing when I saw it. I've described the strange hypnotic quality of his voice before, and I can announce without fear of contradiction that he's still got it.    * I was struck by the difference between the argumentation styles of Prof. Arkes and the lead student debater for the pro-gay marriage side. The professor's argument, which I've hear a dozen or so times, is that traditional marriage is critically tied to the "natural teleology of the body" (one of the coolest phrases around): that the begetting of children (the obvious purpose of human sexuality) is an enterprise that requires a specific formula, one man and one woman (no more, no less, and in no different gender-permutations). Once you detach marriage from this "teleology of the body," from procreative sex, in order to extend it to homosexual couples, there is no principled ground for extending it further, to include groups with more than two members, or sterile adult incestuous couples. Or even, as Professor Arkes points out, couples in which there is no pretense of any erotic or romantic bond. Why shouldn't a pair of maiden aunts taking care of an orphaned nephew, or a grandmother and mother taking care of their grandchildren/children, be able to avail themselves of the various benefits we now associate with marriage? Simply because they're not  doin' it ? And yet, once "marriage" has been expanded this far, to the point where a marriage can include any number of people, and those people can have any conceivable relationship with one another, will "marriage" have any meaning? We'd have a situation in which literally everyone in the United States could marry everyone else, simultaneously. What, then, would be special about "marriage"?  The professor's arguments, as I hope I've laid out, take the form of a logically reasoned argument. You may disagree with his principles, or disagree with the inferences he draws from them, or how he links up inferences, or you may accept his argument and nevertheless pull back from his conclusions. But you can, at least, see his argument. You can watch as he takes you from A to B to C and finally to D. You can disagree with his argument, but at least you can know, with some degree of certainty, what the argument is that you're disagreeing with.   The lead student debater, who from the comments made by others I take to be held in high esteem by the Boston University forensics community, had a different style. I would call it emotional-demagogic, if I felt I could without suggesting negative connotations I don't mean to suggest. Whatever the name of the style, his speech was notably more difficult for me to diagram than the professor's. He began by speaking of the lowly status of women in colonial and pre-20th century America, in which they had few rights and could not even form legal contracts (truth indeed). Then he turned to the long ban on interracial marriage in the country, which he rightly decried as shameful. (At this point in his speech I got up to pee; if I missed a crucial logical point, I apologize.) By the time I got back, he was talking about how shows like  "My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance"  have debased the institution of marriage, and how appalling the country's divorce rates are. Then he brings up Brittany Spears' micro-marriage, which lead to the inevitable-in-debates-about-SSM point:  if Brittany Spears can marry some shlep from Louisiana because it's Vegas, it's 5:00 am, and she's bored, and get a divorce the next day  [an annulment, actually, but who's counting],  why can't a pair of lesbians who love each other and are dedicated to each other tie the knot.  Then he quotes Plato (in response to the good professor's ancient name-dropping), specifically the theory of the origin of love from the  Symposium  (you know, people cut in half, searching for their other half, etc. cf:  Hedwig and the Angry Inch ).   All of which, through a species of rhetorical prestidigitation, becomes: the government should sanction same-sex marriages. I hope, perhaps, I've made my point by indirection. His argument, as near as I can tell, was a) that we refused to permit certain types of marriages in the past, and that was wrong; therefore, when we refuse to permit certain types of marriage today, that's wrong;† and b) "traditional marriage," as the professor outlines it, isn't really what we have today - so why use that as a straw-man to deny gay couples the right to participate in the tumultuous, screwed-up, never-quite-works-out institution straight couples actually experience. Anyway, I think those are the arguments; you have to pan pretty adeptly through the river mud of his verbiage to get to the gold-nuggets of his point. By its tone, the speech was not really an argument designed to persuade, at least in a logical way. It was designed to make people  feel  a certain way. Especially, I think, it was designed to make the generally pro-gay marriage audience feel good about their support for gay marriage. Not to arm them with compelling arguments to convert opponents, but to remind them of why they're on the side of the angels. It's worth noting that the student debater left the podium to applause, while Professor Arkes left to the sound of the papers of his prepare speech ruffling up against his microphone.    * My final observation in this rapidly growing post is that the arguments in favor of same-sex marriage are themselves about enshrining a certain degree of bigotry in the law. The student debater's meta-argument he summarized in one sentence, which he repeated over and over: he wants to live in a country where someone could marry the person of their choice. Yet, if pressed, he surely would have said he supports laws preventing siblings from marrying, or preventing a man who's already married from taking on a second wife without divorcing his first. And yet, even if there is legally recognized same-sex marriage, if a man wants to marry his sister but cannot because the law forbids it, would we really live in a country where a person can marry the person of their choice?  The argument of the mainstream proponents of same-sex marriage is basically "Equal marriage rights for gay and straight couples! Polyamorists and consanguinosexuals can go to hell!" which isn't an unreasonable argument. After all, Saudi princes and sister-lovers should fight their own battles; gays don't have some kind of moral imperative to be the champions of every non-traditional sexual persuasion. But they should recognize a) that when they say they want everyone to be able to marry the person of their choice,  they don't really mean it ; and b) defining marriage as between  two    unrelated  persons, they are, by their own logic, enshrining in the law the deliberate exclusion from marriage rights of certain sexual minorities, with no greater justification (that I can see) than that those groups are small, and relatively powerless, and unpopular, and closeted. Gosh, that sounds strangely familiar...     †The logically stronger, if rhetorically weaker, version of this argument I actually agree with: that given that we were wrong when we denied interracial couples the right to marry a half-century ago, we ought to carefully consider our arguments for not extending marriage rights to new groups seeking them today, to be certain our justifications are not merely a mask for irrational prejudice.

      PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE QUERY(S): Let's say the Supreme Court upholds the Ninth Circuit's ruling in  Elk Grove School District v. Nedow , and it becomes unconstitutional across the country for public schools to start the day off with the pledge of allegiance if it includes the phrase "under God." What happens then?  * Public schools become a pledge-free zone, just like they're now a prayer-free zone, but the pledge, complete with "under God," continues to run wild elsewhere: private and religious schools, the Congress, flag-factories. So we get to keep the pledge, with all it's attendant religious establishment and/or ceremonial deism, but vulnerable public school children will ( deo gratias ) be protected from its pernicious doctrines.   OR  * Public schools will continue to begin the morning with the pledge of allegiance, albeit one purged of the offending phrase.  If it's the latter (which I think more likely) this raises other questions. Will everyone start using the new, abridged pledge?  Or will a two-track system develop, in which the public schools use one pledge and other institutions use another? (For a parallel, think of the Catholic and Protestant versions of the Lord's Prayer.)  And , if public schools start using the new "clipped" pledge, what happens if kids start voluntarily inserting "under God" back in? Are schools going to start punishing those pint-sized civil disobedients? Would  that  violate the Establishment Clause?

      QUIT YER BITCHING ABOUT AIRPORT SECURITY. Quoth  Slate's Tim Noah,  "I don't mind being the haystack, because Sept. 11 taught me that there are needles out there." I agree. A few months after September 11th, I did some flying between Hartford and Washington. I was always bothered that I wasn't being searched more thoroughly at the gate. I had, I think, the kind of profile they should have been watching out for: young (21), male, with a thick beard, an unusual name, little luggage, one-way tickets, an almost out-of-date passport that doesn't look like me, a driver's license that has a different birthdate on it than the passport (long story), &c. I'm not a terrorist, of course, but you wouldn't know that to look at me (or at least, you wouldn't've at the time). I thought then, and still do, that people like me, rather than randomly selected grandmothers, ought to face elevated scrutiny in airports and the like. Of course it's an inconvenience, but it's a reasonable one, and one that makes the country, and me, safer.

      MICKEY KAUS IS A F***ING GENIUS. Since he doesn't "do" functional permalinks, I'll just have to quote the relevant post in full:    Kerry's Brilliant Scheme:  Roger Simon (the U.S. News writer, not the novelist/blogger) thinks Kerry's idea of not accepting the Democratic nomination at his party's convention--in order to accept it a month later--is "too dumb even for politics."   If Kerry does not accept the nomination at his convention, how will he get anybody to watch it? The damn things are dull enough, but a convention without the presidential candidate accepting?  Who would tune in to watch such a thing?  And by giving up their audience, the Democrats will give up tons of free publicity. [Emphasis added]  I was initially skeptical of the delayed-acceptance idea myself, thinking it too clever by half. But that was before I realized its diabolical tactical brilliance. You see, Kerry's handlers have clearly been busy analyzing reams of scientific opinion research--and they've reached the same conclusion that pollster Scott Rasmussen reached a couple of weeks ago:   Senator Kerry loses a few points every time the spotlight focuses on him. Kerry's numbers bounce back when the focus returns to the President.  Indeed, Kerry has been virtually invisible on the national radar screen lately--and he's been slowly climbing in the polls.   But the Kerry camp faced what might seem to be an insurmountable challenge: the July Democratic convention in Boston, when the nation's press surely plans to focus on the Democratic nominee, beaming his every word into the nation's living rooms, allowing voters to get to know him and take the measure of his character and personality. Kerry's highly-paid strategists instantly recognized that this would be a disaster for their client. So they have  crafted a cunning plan designed to get the TV networks to avoid covering the convention entirely,  while the reporters who might otherwise be exposing Kerry to the world are convinced to stay at home. (Give up 'tons of free publicity'? Nothing's more threatening to Kerry than tons of free publicity.)  But there's more to the complex plan than just keeping Kerry off the air. By delaying acceptance of the nomination, Kerry can encourage speculation that he might just turn it down! Why, he may not be the nominee at all! This will result in  wild journalistic scenarios about possible "Torricelli options,"  distracting public attention from Kerry's spirit-sapping persona much as chaff dropped from an airplane causes anti-aircraft missiles to veer off-target. Kerry's vice-presidential pick, in particular, will get star treatment from the press--another plus, since he or she will almost certainly be more appealing than Kerry himself. Perhaps Kerry's lawyers can even figure out a way for his vice-presidential choice to formally accept the #2 slot while Kerry delays--making the vice presidential candidate, in effect, the top standard-bearer and spokesman of the Democrats for a few precious weeks.  The "non-acceptance" gambit is not about campaign money. That's just the cover story! (As if money spent in August made that much difference--a point Simon makes rather forcefully.) Nor is  Kerry's seemingly suicidal plan to draw attention to himself  by giving a series of high-profile national security speeches over the next 11 days anything but another clever feint. The proof: Just see if he actually says anything memorable! According to ABC's The Note, Kerry plans "town-hall meetings and discussions with military families, veterans, and fire and police personnel." Heh, heh. No network news producer is going to bump Iraq off the air for those proven coma-inducers! If it seems like the Kerry planners are trying to put Mark Halperin to sleep, maybe that's because they are.  A convention without an acceptance speech. "Who would tune in to watch such a thing?" Exactly! The Democratic wizards have tipped their hand. Their secret is out.Their game plan has been revealed to the world! It's to  keep the American public from realizing until the last possible moment the grim reality that Kerry really is the Democratic alternative.    If they could take Wonkette's advice and have Kerry delay accepting the nomination until, say, November 1, it might actually work. [ She said Nov. 3, not Nov.1-ed.  Right! Democrats could urge Americans to vote for a nominee to be chosen after the election by U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi!} 12:47 A.M.  C'est brilliant, no? If I'm feeling especially industrious later, I'll include Kaus' permalinks. For now, I'm off to Oklahoma City, to see a certain Brer Fox graduate high school.

      THE SECOND-GREATEST SPEECH BY THE GREATEST ENGLISH-LANGUAGE ORATOR,  the Cooper Union Address , was broadcast earlier today on CSPAN. Well, sort of. They actually re-aired  Sam Waterston's May 5 reenactment of the speech.  I wanted to go see it then, but that was my last day of Criminal Procedure, and some vague sense of responsibility bound me to stay in New Haven. So it was a great blessing to stumble upon it this afternoon. I love Waterston (now that Briscoe is gone he's the best thing about Law & Order) and I love the Cooper Union Address. Waterston gave a great performance, which though it was not necessarily how I imagine Lincoln was still quite stirring.  What makes Cooper Union such a great speech? Well, there's the methodical, lyrical and thoroughly convincing argument that the Founders supported the idea that there was not "any line dividing local from federal authority, or anything in the Constitution, properly forbade the Federal Government to control as to slavery in federal territory." (The same First Congress that proposed the Fifth Amendment, on which the Supreme Court relied in  Dred Scott , and the Tenth Amendment, on which Stephen Douglas based his arguments, also passed an act to enforce the Northwest Ordinance, which had forbad the extension of slavery into the old Northwest Territory.)  There are other great bits too. There's an almost Chestertonian argument about the role of tradition: " I do not mean to say we are bound to follow implicitly in whatever our fathers did. To do so, would be to discard all the lights of current experience - to reject all progress - all improvement. What I do say is, that if we would supplant the opinions and policy of our fathers in any case, we should do so upon evidence so conclusive, and argument so clear, that even their great authority, fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand."    There's a good explanation of Lincoln's theory of constitutional interpretation, in which the Court is not the sole arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution but rather part of a dialogue that includes the political branches:   Perhaps you will say the Supreme Court has decided the disputed Constitutional question in your favor. Not quite so. But waiving the lawyer's distinction between dictum and decision, the Court have decided the question for you in a sort of way. The Court have substantially said, it is your Constitutional right to take slaves into the federal territories, and to hold them there as property. When I say the decision was made in a sort of way, I mean it was made in a divided Court, by a bare majority of the Judges, and they not quite agreeing with one another in the reasons for making it; that it is so made as that its avowed supporters disagree with one another about its meaning, and that it was mainly based upon a mistaken statement of fact - the statement in the opinion that "the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution."  An inspection of the Constitution will show that the right of property in a slave is not "distinctly and expressly affirmed" in it. Bear in mind, the Judges do not pledge their judicial opinion that such right is impliedly affirmed in the Constitution; but they pledge their veracity that it is "distinctly and expressly" affirmed there - "distinctly," that is, not mingled with anything else - "expressly," that is, in words meaning just that, without the aid of any inference, and susceptible of no other meaning.  If they had only pledged their judicial opinion that such right is affirmed in the instrument by implication, it would be open to others to show that neither the word "slave" nor "slavery" is to be found in the Constitution, nor the word "property" even, in any connection with language alluding to the things slave, or slavery; and that wherever in that instrument the slave is alluded to, he is called a "person;" - and wherever his master's legal right in relation to him is alluded to, it is spoken of as "service or labor which may be due," - as a debt payable in service or labor. Also, it would be open to show, by contemporaneous history, that this mode of alluding to slaves and slavery, instead of speaking of them, was employed on purpose to exclude from the Constitution the idea that there could be property in man.  To show all this, is easy and certain.  When this obvious mistake of the Judges shall be brought to their notice, is it not reasonable to expect that they will withdraw the mistaken statement, and reconsider the conclusion based upon it?  (You'll note I've just discovered how to use the "blockquote" HTML tag. Huzzah!) The best part, and the best zingers, come when Lincoln directly addresses the South, and lays out for his fellow Republicans and Northerners what was at stake in the argument. He says:   Your purpose, then, plainly stated, is that you will destroy the Government, unless you be allowed to construe and enforce the Constitution as you please, on all points in dispute between you and us. You will rule or ruin in all events.  And:   Will they [the South] be satisfied if the Territories be unconditionally surrendered to them? We know they will not. In all their present complaints against us, the Territories are scarcely mentioned. Invasions and insurrections are the rage now. Will it satisfy them, if, in the future, we have nothing to do with invasions and insurrections? We know it will not. We so know, because we know we never had anything to do with invasions and insurrections; and yet this total abstaining does not exempt us from the charge and the denunciation.  The question recurs, what will satisfy them? Simply this: We must not only let them alone, but we must somehow, convince them that we do let them alone. This, we know by experience, is no easy task. We have been so trying to convince them from the very beginning of our organization, but with no success. In all our platforms and speeches we have constantly protested our purpose to let them alone; but this has had no tendency to convince them. Alike unavailing to convince them, is the fact that they have never detected a man of us in any attempt to disturb them.  These natural, and apparently adequate means all failing, what will convince them? This, and this only: cease to call slavery wrong, and join them in calling it right. And this must be done thoroughly - done in acts as well as in words. Silence will not be tolerated - we must place ourselves avowedly with them. Senator Douglas' new sedition law must be enacted and enforced, suppressing all declarations that slavery is wrong, whether made in politics, in presses, in pulpits, or in private. We must arrest and return their fugitive slaves with greedy pleasure. We must pull down our Free State constitutions. The whole atmosphere must be disinfected from all taint of opposition to slavery, before they will cease to believe that all their troubles proceed from us.  And, in one of my all-time favorite English-language sentences - the one that inspired me to write, so often, to pen long-but-grammatically-correct sentences, such as this one, that drove year after year of English teachers, and later my thesis advisor, into fits:   Let us be diverted by none of those sophistical contrivances wherewith we are so industriously plied and belabored - contrivances such as groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong, vain as the search for a man who should be neither a living man nor a dead man - such as a policy of "don't care" on a question about which all true men do care - such as Union appeals beseeching true Union men to yield to Disunionists, reversing the divine rule, and calling, not the sinners, but the righteous to repentance - such as invocations to Washington, imploring men to unsay what Washington said, and undo what Washington did.  A great speech, and a great giving of that speech. One longs for the day when political speeches were buttressed by argument instead of partisan invective or empty sloganeering. (Y'know, Bush has a point when he says "Compassionate Conservatism"; but on the other hand, I really would like to "Let America Be America Again".) Ahh, well: each generation has its demagogues, I suppose. We're not sent men like Lincoln in every age. The best we can hope for, I imagine, is that we get them when we need them.

      RE: THE DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE to the proposed withholding of the Eucharist from pro-choice politicians. I may get to  this issue  in greater depth later. For now, a quick, and somewhat cheeky, question:  How is it that it's a threat to the separation of church and state when the leadership of a church considers imposing private, religious sanctions on parishioners for their words and deeds, but it's a defense of the separation of church and state for four-dozen sitting members of Congress to publish an open letter telling the leadership of a church who should or should not be receiving its sacraments?  just curious

      I HAVE TO ADMIT IT, I WAS KIND OF UNDERWHELMED by last night's Law & Order. The plot wasn't ripped from the headlines; it was ripped from the Warner Bros.' film archive. It was just a cheap knock-off of  "Strangers on a Train" , as even the shows writers acknowledged in a throwaway line. The retirement of Lennie Briscoe was handled with subtlety - probably too much subtlety. One the one hand, it was nice, after what I'm told was the hyper-maudlin Friends finale, to see a show mark the end with some sense of understatement. On the other hand, Briscoe was a great character, who'd been part of my mental furniture for years. I would have appreciated a little more to-do.

      "NOT BALD, SHAVED" as Michael Wilbon would say.  The bald eagle is making a fantastic comeback.  (link found via  the Corner ) Interesting stat (also pointed out at the Corner): there are now bald eagle nesting pairs in every state but Rhode Island and Vermont (and Hawaii,  which was never part of the bald eagle range ). Surely it's no coincidence that the bald eagle is avoiding the country's most liberal states; clearly the bird is the rock-ribbed conservative of the flighted-animal community. Once again, the Muppet Show  fails to lead us astray.

      LOOK, I'M NOT ONE TO SCREAM McCARTHYISM IN A CROWDED THEATER, but there's something in  this story  that I find mighty disturbing. The piece, which was linked to off  Zorak 's blog, is about a conservative professor who suffered various indignities for being conservative. Disturbing enough. But what really creeped me out was this passage, regarding one of her liberal tormenters:  "The man who made that call, Dr. Mokerrom Hossain, may himself get to spend some quality time outside the office. The FBI is investigating the sociology department chairman for possible links to Al Qaeda. One tip-off was the fact that his office computer had an Al Qaeda screen saver. Dr. Hossain, a Sunni Muslim, made the excuse that his son put it there, without explaining how his son had access to the university computer."  I'm sorry:  waaah?  I hope that they've got something more on this guy than that. Look, I want to prevent al-Qaeda attacks as much as the next guy, and I understand that there are probably some number of al-Qaeda sleepers and sympathizers in the United States. But are we really at the point where the FBI gets involved every time a Sunni pops up with an al-Qaeda screen saver on his office computer? Not to go all  Mark Shea  on your collective ass, or anything, but might that not be a bit of an overreaction?

      WHY THE WASHINGTON POST IS BETTER THAN THE NEW YORK TIMES, PART MCMXVII: Taking a quick break from my current exam-related project (creating a short-form outline for my Criminal Procedure class), I was surfing through the archives at  Eve Tushnet's blog . (Here in the Fox's croft, we know how to have a good time.) Now, in May of 2002 (that's almost two years ago, for those keeping score) Ms. Tushnet  linked  to a  Washington Post  article on  Virginia issuing license plates commemorating September 11th.  As you can see, the link is still good two years later. The article is still available, for free, on the  Post 's website, and it's still accessible via the same URL that got you there the day it was put up. Compare this to the  Times , which sends its articles to the pay-to-view archive  seven days  after publication. (Like this  David Brooks  op-ed, linked to by  Matthew Yglesias .) At least the old links still direct you generally to the article you wanted (thank Heaven for small favors). I know this is old news, known to all, but sometimes its useful to be confronted again with the things you already know.

      A THOUGHT ON POST-FACTO JUSTIFICATION Having finished my second exam (American Legal History) I've decided to allot myself one post's worth of pontification. If you've had enough of my BS, please move on to the amusing anecdotes about Yankees baseball you'll find below. Of course, if you'd had enough of my BS, you would have long ago removed me from your "favorites".   Anyway, while viewing  the Professor 's blog this morning, I came across  this  story, which suggests that there might actually be something widely-held-but-officially disbelieved idea that Iraq had something to do with the September 11th attacks. (I know, I know: it's FrontPageMag. Believe me, if I could get it in the  Atlantic Monthly , I would.)  I got to thinking: what if it's true? If the Ba'athist government of Iraq actually did help facilitate the September 11th attacks, does that change our analysis of whether of not the war was justified? Can information subsequently acquired justify a war that would otherwise have been unjustified? Or are we stuck with the information we had at the time (which suggested that there was no link, or at least no reliable evidence of one)?  And yet, if we're stuck with what we knew at the time, doesn't that suggest that the apparent absence of any WMDs can't be used to impeach the justification for the war? After all, almost everyone believed the Iraqis had  some  WMD capabilities before the war. That belief was reasonable, it just happened to be false. If a war can't be justified by new information discovered after the fact, why can a war be proved unjust by subsequent discoveries?  One could, I suppose, devise a theory of just war in which that could be the case, in which a war's justification could never be increased from where it was prior to the conflict, but could be decreased by subsequent developments demonstrating that pre-war assumptions used to justify war (like the presence of WMD stockpiles) were shown to be false. Such a system might get the incentives right, decreasing the likelihood that parties which subscribe to that just war theory would start wars.  Of course, the whole point of the Bush Doctrine is that the state of affairs I've just described (civilized states extremely reluctant to make war unless attacked or virtually certain of imminent attack) does  not  get the incentives right, at least not in a post-9/11 world in which it's clear that an imminent threat need not be take the form of massed armies or an approaching armada, and that an actual attack can kill thousands of innocent civilians.   I am not a smart man: I don't know which (if either) of these positions is the right one. I just kind of wish we had had this debate two years ago, when we were preparing to mass troops on the Kuwaiti border, and not now, while we're occupying a medium-sized country (or worse, never). Oh, to live in a more philosophic country. But alas...      In the meantime:    BUSH IS A NAZI!  ASHCROFT IS THE DEVIL!  RUMSFELD WASHES DOWN  THE LIMBS OF IRAQI BABIES WITH  A TALL GLASS OF SWEET CRUDE OIL!      KERRY PLANS TO TURN  THE WHITE HOUSE INTO A TIME-SHARE  AND RENT IT OUT TO THE VIET CONG,  AL-QAEDA,  AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD!     ahh, that feels much better.

      JUST SO YOU KNOW, LEST I BE ACCUSED OF BEING A HOLIER-THAN-THOU JERK: I find myself particularly prone to the below mentioned sin (scandal). This is largely an artifact of my personality: despite being gruff, I'm actually very eager-to-please and eager-to-help. I like to encourage people, and to help them out. The problem is, in this fallen world, that I often wind up encouraging people to sin, or assisting them in their sin, simply because my default setting is "encourage" or "help". To be honest, also, I like to be liked, and people don't often like to be told things like: "Well, I'm happy that you're happy, but I really wish it wasn't cheating on the Contracts exam that made you happy." I'm working on this, I really am, but it's hard. But then, I suppose the whole Christianity business is supposed to be hard, after a fashion. Narrow gate, and all.  The second thing you should know: I myself often (too often, alas; though ever is probably too often [be perfect as your Father is perfect, et al.]) don't receive Communion. Because (see above) I'm weak and fall into sin, and because I respect the Eucharist and fear the sin of sacrilege (eating my own destruction, and all that). I use the time to pray, to ask God's forgiveness for what I've done, and to reflect on my actions. Painful and unpleasant as it is, I actually consider those moments to be a kind of blessing, an occasion for reflecting on the nature of mortal sin, the ultimate fate of my soul, and all that metaphysical jazz. When I consider the magnitude of what I'm giving up (i.e., communion with God) and weigh it against the trivial, temporary pleasures of the sin that I took in exchange for that great good, I begin to appreciate somewhat the monumental folly of sin, which would be laughable, of course, if it weren't so deadly serious. Separation from the Eucharist is a foretaste of that final separation, that Great Divorce, and then too I think we may laugh one last, pained laugh at the insignificance at the pleasures we exchanged for the Beatific Vision before we're cast, finally, into the dark from whence we'll laugh no more.  OK, I'm getting too pseudopoetical; it's not my strength, as you've no doubt discovered. To sum up: I don't think I'm better than you; if anything, I'm worse.  But I'm trying, I really am.

      GIVING COMMUNION TO PRO-CHOICE POLS: WHAT DOES THE PRIEST RISK? A question about  these kinds of policies , in which the question of whether to receive Holy Communion or not is left up to the individual parishioner, which I'd like a more knowledgeable Catholic than I to answer: if a priest distributes Holy Communion to a person whom the priest  knows  to be in a state of mortal sin, hasn't that priest committed the sin of scandal? He's assisting the communicant in committing the sin of sacrilege,  fully cognizant that the communicant is unfit to receive the Host, and is multiplying his sin by taking Communion while unfit.    Maybe I'm wrong, but my impression was that scandal was sort of the spiritual version of accomplice liability, whereby one becomes liable for the sins of another when one aids, encourages or (post facto) praises those sins. (No doubt you can tell I'm getting ready for my Criminal Law & Administration exam.) This seems to apply whether or not the scandalous aid/encouragement was the but-for cause of the sin - you can't escape responsibility by saying that someone else would have bought Li'l Timmy those condoms, although, of course, someone would have - but it would seem to be especially present in instances, like these, in which the scandalizer  is  in fact a but-for cause of the sin. If the priest (or extraordinary minister) refuses to give the Eucharist, the would-be recipient isn't going to be able to commit sacrilege. (I mean, I suppose he could go to another church, or try to punch out the priest and grab the Host from his prone body....)  What I'm getting at is that it seems to me that priests have a responsibility for their own spiritual well-being not to distribute Communion in circumstances in which they know it would be a sin for the person to receive Communion. I'm not advocating establishing a national inquisition, or posting hall monitors at the confessionals and denying Communion to people who don't show up regularly. There are plenty of good reasons (for one, the charitable obligation to assume the best of our fellow man) to have the default policy be that individuals determine whether or not they should be receiving the Eucharist, based on an examination of their own consciences. But in instances in which the priest has actual knowledge that a specific individual has on his conscience an unconfessed mortal sin (say, he's just been caught stealing from the collection basket, or masturbating in one of the pews) it seems not only reasonable but necessary that the priest deny that person receipt of communion. The priest cannot be neutral as to whether one of his parishioners is committing sacrilege. "Feed my sheep," people.

      PANDA PORNO  The annual ritual of watching dichromatic quasi-ursine captive animals hump (or not hump)  has begun again.  (link via  Cacciaguida )  When I was a kid, I was crazy for pandas. I had a stuffed-animal panda, purchased at the National Zoo, who went by Pandy Lincoln (he occasionally wore a miniature stove-pipe hat that I made out of construction paper). Pandy Lincoln was my  Velveteen Rabbit , and even now I have a certain sentimental fondness for the species in remembrance of that long-lost toy-who-became-real.  That said, my interest in pandas is more than just sentimental. There's something about the national fascination with whether they will or will not reproduce that intrigues me. Certainly it emerges in part from purely zoological and environmental concerns - giant pandas are badly endangered, and every time they fail to reproduce they move, in some sense, one step closer to ultimate extinction. But I wonder, perhaps, if it isn't something more than that, if it doesn't fall into the strange matrix of the culture's relationship with reproduction more generally. At the risk of generalizing wildly, our culture seems to delight in defying what seem to be the natural processes of reproduction. Huge amounts of money and effort are expended trying to get pregnant things that seem to have a substantial natural difficulty getting pregnant - women over 40, sterile or lesbian couples, giant pandas - through all sorts of fancy scientific procedures. At the same time, equally large amounts of money and effort are expended trying to keep from getting pregnant things that seem to have a relatively easy time getting pregnant - women in their teens and twenties, cats and dogs - through widespread use of birth control or through spaying / neutering. I suppose those aren't inherently inconsistent ways of going about in the world, but it still seems a strange pairing to me. And I know, of course, that a great many people reproduce themselves quite naturally.    No substantive recommendations here (I hope you haven't come to the fox for  advice ), just observations. Make of them what you will.

      ANOTHER GOOD MOORE GUT-SHOT (DON'T LOSE YOUR HAND!)  This  New Republic  piece  makes a few good points about  Fahrenheit 9/11  and it's creator. The first is that the movie, particularly in its second half in which it focuses on the suffering of a mother whose son has just died in Iraq, attempts to conflate two essentially unrelated questions. The first is  Was the war in Iraq (and the war in Afghanistan) justified?  The second is  Is the United States military constituted in a just way?  These are fundamentally different questions, and a no to the latter doesn't necessarily mean a no to the former. (Beg to differ? Consider: World War II was fought by a segregated military, and the Union army in the Civil War was raised in part by a draft that the rich could buy out of. Were either unjust wars as a result?)  The second point the author makes is that Moore doesn't seek to explore the question of  why  America's army is comprised so heavily of the poor and lower middle class; he simply pretends to explore it while using it to score polemical points (see  Columbine, Bowling for,  minutes one through 120). Of course, if he did, he might discover that the blame for the lopsidedness of military service in this country lies in no small part with the people who make up his own fan-base: upper-middle and upper-class professionals who perpetuate a culture that insists that military service is simply beneath the status of themselves and their children. When I tried to join the army a little over a year ago, I was shocked to discover how many people were shocked that I was even considering it. The idea that, in an age when our country was at war, a war that had reached our home soil, I would consider taking a few years off between college and law school seemed incomprehensible to them. Surely I was joking, or at least had some ulterior motive (political ambition being the most frequently theorized - I confess it's true: I long to someday be a small-town alderman). It's not only congressmen whose sons aren't bleeding in Iraq; how many of Moore's friends have children in the military? I mean his current social circle on the Upper West Side, not the good people of Flint who get dusted off every time our cinematic Pantagruel needs to seem authentic. There's a solution to the class imbalance in the military: it's for all those upper-middle class Michael Moore fans who're upset about class imbalance in the military to get off their collective ass and enlist in the damn military. C'mon, folks: think globally, act locally!  The third point is that the respectable Left is increasingly coming to view Moore through the "he may be a sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch" lens.  You see it in this Slate review too.  The basic point seems to be "Sure, his movies are filled with lies, distortions and looney conspiracy theories, but he raises some important issues for discussion along with the dreck, and to the extent that anyone is actually taken in by his nonsense they'll be driven to vote against Bush, which is a good thing. And anyway, the Right has its own lie-propagating attack machine. It's important we can respond in kind." Of course, the last 20-odd years have suggested that having "our sonofabitch" maybe isn't that great an idea after all. (see Hussein, Saddam; Noriega, Manuel; Marcos, Ferdinand; et al) As Mark Steyn put it,  "He may be our sonofabitch, but he's a sonofabitch."   Of course, I haven't seen the movie. Many others have. Are my non-impressed impressions on point at all?

      A REALLY INTERESTING POINT ON BREAKING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL: A Conspiracy guest-blogger  points out  that any effort to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels in order to reduce the relative geopolitical power of the Middle East might have the effect of actually  strengthening  the region.   It's quite a clever point: Any successful effort to decrease our need for foreign oil would involve decreasing our total dependence on petroleum. This would result in a decline in the world-wide price of oil, which would in turn lead the marginal oil wells, located outside of the Middle East, to become unprofitable and shut down. Middle Eastern oil would come to make up "larger slice of a smaller pie".   It seems to me this would make the Middle Eastern oilocracies less wealthy as an absolute matter, but make them more able to artificially manipulate the oil market like they did in the 1970s. Lacking more specific information, I'd call that a wash. There may be other reasons to use less gas, but "because it will impoverish those whose wealth supports terrorism" probably ain't one of them.

      MORE ON MOORE: Slate's  review  of  Fahrenheit 9/11  is pretty good. By which I mean, it confirms my existing beliefs about its subject. That is, I believe, the going blogospheric definition of "good". But it includes this somewhat odd line: Needless to say,  Fahrenheit 9/11  never waffles. The liberals'  The Passion of the Christ , it ascribes only the most venal motives to the other side. The "other side" in TOPTC is, y'know, Satan. Is David Edelstein saying that Gibson's film should give him the benefit of the doubt?

      COULD THE GOVERNMENT BAN ADS FOR  FAHRENHEIT 9/11 ? So it seems. As they say: there are unintended consequences,  and then there are unintended consequences.  See, McCain-Feingold forbids corporate-funded ads that identify or refer to political candidates in the period leading up to an election.   Fahrenheit 9/11   is about President Bush, so its ads can't help but refer to the president. And the movie is being distributed by Lion's Gate Films, which is, of course,  a corporation.  QED, ads for  Fahrenheit 9/11  can be banned by the FEC after July 30.  Nope, nothing unjust about McCain-Feingold. Move along folks, nothing to see here.

      EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THE WORLD I LEARNED FROM KARAOKE.  You want to talk about "pervasive eroticism"?  Try doing karaoke in southern Connecticut, and having a couple of young ladies hit you with  the Pussycat Song . (WARNING: The lyrics are more than a little lewd, and the website will try to offer you plugins that you don't want to download. Click awares.) All cultures, I'm sure, have bawdy songs, with suggestive double-entendres. Such things, I imagine, are natural. But there's something about how thoroughly explicit this song's lyrics are that set them apart. They made me, a hard-hearted and cynical 23 year-old, genuinely uncomfortable as I listened. What's happened to our culture when young ladies feel entirely comfortable singing a song whose lyrics read like the transcript to a porno film in front of a room of total strangers?  Zuh...   As for myself, my rendition of  In the Ghetto  was both tasteful and soulful.

There are actually records of convicts in Spain purposely blaspheming so that they could be transferred to the prisons of the Spanish Inquisition.  Of course, it's all just nasty Romish propaganda, so feel free to ignore.

      YES, I AM A PREPPY BASTARD. SUE ME.  Unlike Matt Yglesias,  I enjoyed  my  high school reunion this weekend. Everyone was very friendly, and I had a wonderful time drinking, hanging out and catching up with people I hadn't seen in years. Even went back to some of my old haunts: King's Subs, Pomps Pond, and Bruegger's Bagels.  Phillips Academy  itself has never looked better; they've built a new science center (the old one was a squat, dank monstrosity from the early 70s; since it was the location of the student newspaper offices, I spent about 40% of my waking hours in that living hell), as well as a football stadium and hockey rink. They all look fantastic. It's easy to throw money at a buildings & grounds renovation and come away with mediocre results - Amherst did this recently with its new freshman dorms. I'm very pleased Andover managed to avoid this trap. All-in-all, a well spent weekend. And now to bed.

      THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAINLINE PROTESTANTS: One often hears that there are more Muslims in this country than Episcopalians. (I most recently heard this fact this morning when one of the TV newscasters - I forget which - was explaining, in part, why an imam would be participating in the Reagan funeral service.) What one doesn't often hear is that the reason for that is largely that there actually aren't that many Episcopalians in this country. Just how many there are is subject to some debate, but the Episcopal Church of the United States  says  there are 2,320,221 baptized members in the United States, and I'm willing to trust them. So there are a little less than 2.5 million Episcopalians in this country.  According to the Census Bureau,  there are about 291 million people living in the United States. That means Episcopalians constitute about 0.8% of the population of the United States.   The other mainline protestant churches - the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterians and the United Church of Christ (the spiritual descendants of the Congregationalists) - aren't doing a whole lot better. The Methodists are the largest, with 8.4 million members  (according to this site) . That's about 2.9% of the US population. The Presbyterians  have about 2.5 million congregants.  Scroll to the bottom to see a graphic portrayal of the decline of a mainline Christian church. (Bear in the mind that, while there are only 60% as many Presbyterians in the country than there 1960,  there are 1.6 times as many Americans as there were in that year.  In 1960, Presbyterians were about 2.5% of the population; today they're 0.9%) The United Church of Christ has about 1.3 million members,  minus the 3300 from the First Church of Christ in Wethersfield who just left over a doctrinal split . (If we're still keeping score, that's about 0.45% of the US population.) The Evangelical Lutherans  have 5 million members , but since I'm feeling generous and don't understand the distinctions between the various branches of Lutheranism I'll toss in the Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod,  which apparently brings the grand total to 9.5 million in North America  Minus the  roughly 200,000 Canadian Lutherans , that's 9.3 million-odd American Lutherans, about 3.2% of the population.  All told, there are about 23.8 million mainline Protestants in the United States; they make up approximately 8% of the population, and shrinking. In contrast, there are  63.4 million Catholics in the United States  (23% of the population). There are  more than 16 million members of the Southern Baptist Convention , along with  3.5 million members of the National Baptist Convention, 2.5 million members of the National Missionary Baptist Convention, and 2.5 million members of the Progressive Baptist Convention; as well as 5.5 million members of the Church of God in Christ, 5.2 million Mormons, 2.6 million members of the Assemblies of God, 2.5 million members of the African Methodist Episcopal church, 1.5 million Pentecostals, etc. etc. etc.    I'm not going to speculate as to the cause of the remarkable decline in mainline Protestantism in this country. I will ask: given that Episcopalianism, Lutheranism, Presbyterianism, Methodism and Congregationalism are now a decided minority within American Protestantism, shouldn't we stop calling them "mainline"? The term implies that they're mainstream, but the truth is that the stream has dwindled into a creek. The true heart of American Protestantism today are the Baptists and the other Evangelical churches. (If my terminology is off here I apologize; I don't know enough about Protestantism to speak entirely precisely.) The old mainline denominations have the many beautiful churches (and some ugly ones - no one was immune from the architectural plague of the 1970s), they have the fancy theological schools and the aura of respectability, but increasingly they don't have parishioners.   (By the way, how weird is it that Episcopalianism and Congregationalism, which 250 years ago were the established religions in the British American colonies, now constitute around 1.25% of the population?  Sic transit gloria )

"Nevertheless, I did not enjoy eating the rotting pig heads that pass for food in that hell-on-earth. Also, all of the peasants wore sandals."

No sooner do I e-kvetch about the lack of good systematic, orthodox, easy-to-use materials on preparation for the sacrament of reconciliation than I find myself in  St. Mary's Priory  staring at  "A primer for confession with an examination of conscience"  by Fr.

      THE GLORIES, AND THE TRAGEDIES, OF GOOGLE, or: Why Do Only the Schismatics Seem to Systematize? The internet is a wonderful tool. Thanks to Google, and other like databases (not to mention blogs), I have at my fingertips a vast library of human knowledge. Including of course knowledge of the doctrine and practice of the Church. It is a great blessing from the Lord (though like all gifts  we've managed to muck it up  in our fashion).  But of course, even the internet is finite. A lot of stuff's just not here. A lot of questions go unanswered. Case in point: this evening I was trying to find the answer to what I'll admit is a somewhat obscure question.  If you've made an incomplete confession because at the time you'd forgotten a mortal sin you had committed prior to that confession, would subsequent receptions of communion be sacrilegious?  (My interest in this subject being not entirely academic.) So tried the Q&A over at  EWTN . And then I googled a couple of different permutations.   I didn't get any definite answers, but I did come across a couple of good web pages with systematic instructions for preparing for confession, both of which included a few choice words on the subject of bad confessions. (You can find them  here  and  here .) At least, I thought they were good web pages. A little digging around quickly corrected that error.   The former page is the product of a Fr. David Trosch, a Catholic priest from Alabama whose archbishop has stripped him of his ability to speak publicly in the name of the Church, presumably because when he did have that faculty he used it to say, in the name of the Church, all kinds of looney things (see below). He's the author of such delightful  bon mots  as "Catholic Mass of Pope Paul VI offensive to God", "Vatican run by Freemasons and Homosexuals" and (my personal fave) "Pope John Paul II is under sentence of automatic excommunication for failure to remove Cardinal Bernard Law and others who have knowingly given Holy Communion to automatically excommunicated Catholics such as Senator Ted Kennedy". I actually sort of liked his highly systematized approach to the examination of the conscience, but given his other kooky views I'm not sure if I want to make him my e-spiritual director (even though he's technically not a schismatic).  The latter page is maintained by the Society of St. Pius X, a schismatic group that left the Church after the Second Vatican Council under the leadership Marcel Archbishop Lefebvre. Since the SSPXers are genuine schismatics, I'm not looking to them as guides to correct practice of the faith, any more than I'd look to Lutherans or Arians or Gnostics. (Though again the systematic nature of their approach appeals to me.)  I suppose this relates to the subject of a couple of posts ( here  and  here ) at Old Oligarch last week: the lost art of theological manuals. We live in an age when there are manuals and "how-to" guides for almost every aspect of life. I haven't checked, but I wouldn't be shocked if there were a  "For Dummies"  book on wiping your own ass. And yet, in the most important things, where doing things right or wrong could make a world of difference, Catholics are given a few years of (often quite shoddy) religious education and then cast from the nest and expected to fly largely on our own. I understand that there are risks involved when one becomes too dependent on manuals; still, for questions like the one that lead me on this mad-cap e-journey to the edge of schism and back again, I can't help but feel that a doctrinal crib sheet would have been a tremendous help. My question is specific, and there's clearly a right answer, and it's important that I know what that answer is (so I can know whether to confess sacrilegious reception as well as the underlying sin): it seems to me there ought to be a place I can go to get a direct answer without having to wake up a priest at 11:00 pm? Isn't that part (albeit a small part) of why God established the Church in the first place?

      THE GIPPER OR D-DAY? This morning, FoxNews and CNN are focusing almost exclusively on the life of President Reagan, whereas MSNBC is talking mostly about the 60th anniversary of D-Day, with only intermittent Reagan coverage. I'm not sure which is the right call. The death of President Reagan is a major event, one that should indeed be covered by the media. At the same time, the 60th anniversary of D-Day is also a momentous occasion; it is likely the last major anniversary of the great battle that any substantial number of veterans will be around to celebrate. So it's a tough call. On balance, I think covering D-Day probably makes more sense. It's the more democratic choice: a commemoration, not of the life of one great man, but of the inestimable courage of thousands of ordinary men. Part of me suspects President Reagan would have thought so too.

      REQUIESCAT IN PACE: RONALD WILSON REAGAN, 1911-2004    I was born a little more than a month before Reagan's first inauguration. He was president throughout my formative years, and even though he's been absent from the public scene for nearly a decade it's still hard to imagine a world without him.   He was one of the giant figures of the 20th century, but others, who were grown in his era, can speak better on that. I pause only to note the passing of a great man.  ( Echoing Jonah Goldberg , I commend you to the Irish wake over at FoxNews. Every death is sad in its fashion, but Reagan lived a long, full life, and he lived to see his life's work, the defeat of Soviet communism, accomplished. Pray God, he will quickly come into his reward. Celebrate him, drink a toast tonight in his honor. Do not weep for him, but be glad.)

      WHY NOT JUST LET PANDAS DIE OUT?  The question is raised in this month's  Touchstone  . From a strictly Darwinian prospective, the Giant Panda is a flop like none known to science. Their diet consists almost exclusively of incredibly non-nutritious (even to them!) leaves and bark. They seem to hate mating, have trouble getting pregnant when they do mate, have trouble carrying to term when they do get pregnant, and are horribly negligent parents when they do carry to term. They seem determined to go extinct. Darwinism is the survival of the fittest, and the fittest they ain't. I'm not saying we should wipe them out, but are we obliged to make a heroic effort to preserve them?  And yet we do. We exert huge amounts of money and energy trying to preserve this fat, dichromatic race of raccoons. (They didn't become the official animal of the  World Wildlife Fund  for nothing. We  love  these goofy bastards!) But why? It could be because they're cute. We may struggle to preserve the panda for the same reason  we restored the Sistine Chapel ceiling : because they appeal to us aesthetically, and we want future generations to appreciate their aesthetic appeal. Or perhaps, as  I've suggested earlier , it has to do with our Frankenstein-like fascination with controlling the creation of life.   I kind of like the theory suggested at the end of the  Touchstone  piece: that even Darwinian materialists can't quite shake some kind of vestigial sense of the role of man as steward of this world, that, entirely divorced from what  we  want, humankind has an objective obligation to care for the natural world, even (especially) those parts of it (like the panda) that are entirely incapable of taking care of themselves.  OK, that's enough pandablogging for a long, long time.

      HMMM, INTERESTING STATISTIC... While reading the indomitable  Mark Shea 's blog, I came across this link to the Straight Dope's  debunking of the oft-cited 10,000 dead a year from illegal abortions pre- Roe  statistic.  Scrolling down, I found this interesting nugget:   For 1972, the last full year before Roe, the federal Centers for Disease Control reported that 39 women died due to illegal abortion. (The death total for all abortions, including legal ones, was 88.) That figure is low, thanks to underreporting, but in any case the number of deaths had been dropping sharply for the previous few years.  So, I understand that underreporting would probably drive down the illegal abortion numbers farther than the legal ones. But still: if we pretend the CDC numbers are good for a second, that means more women died from legal abortions in 1972 than from illegal ones.

       "Why are Americans so fat?"  ask Subway subs tray-liners in Germany, which feature an image of a tubby Lady Liberty holding a burger and fries. The tray-liners also feature a quote from Michael Moore: "The only time I have been scared for my life has been going through a McDonald’s drive-thru." The irony, of course, is that Michael Moore is himself morbidly obese. To paraphrase Mr. Burns: he's the fattest thing I've ever seen, and I've been on safari. The idea that anyone ought to be taking his dietary advice is more than a little laughable.   Here's  the German-language tray-liner.   Here's  the Southern Appeal post on this subject.

      I didn't see his speech last night. (I watched a grand total of about five minutes of the Democratic National Convention.) Did he really say that the Fourth Commandment ("honor thy father and thy mother") prohibits privatizing Social Security? What a mind this guy has!  Life begins at conception,  but the Fifth Commandment doesn't require that we protect that life. But meddle, even on the margins, with the American system of old-age pensions devised in the 1930s, and you're on the fast-track to Hell.   Woe to all those good Christian princes now damned to fire and torment because they did not see, as John Kerry sees, the truth: no one comes to the Father except through Social Security.  ( to put it differently .)

       Here's  a  Weekly Standard  on John Kerry's home church, which is run by  the Paulist Fathers.  It's an interesting article, which I recommend to you. (For what it's worth, I think it says a lot about the difference between John Kerry and I that he attends  this church  while I attend  this one .)  Here's the issue that jumped out at me from the  Weekly Standard  piece (which, I should note, I found via a link from  Amy Welborn's blog ): the author reports that Kerry's church, the Paulist Center, says a truncated version of the Nicene Creed during the celebration of Mass.  During the Nicene Creed, for example, the sections on believing in only "one Lord" ("We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God . . .") and only "one holy Catholic and apostolic Church" are excised from the prayer. I've never been to the Paulist Center, so I don't know if they actually do this, but for the sake of argument let's stipulate that the report is accurate. Isn't this a big deal? At least as big a deal as  filioque ?  My assumption is that the people running the Paulist center have excised these sections from the Creed because they don't believe they're true, or at least because they don't believe that it's necessary to believe they're true to be a faithful Catholic. The thing is, unless I'm mistaken it in fact  is  necessary to believe those things to be Catholic.  That's why they're in the Creed.  I just can't imagine how you can be a Catholic and not believe in the sole lordship of Jesus Christ (or in his sole-begotten-Son-ship) or in the unity, catholicity and apostolicity of the Church. That's certainly not  all  you have to believe (the role of the See of Peter comes to mind), but I've got to believe that they're non-negotiable requirements.   So my question is: is this localized at this one church? Or is this the position of the Paulist Fathers as a whole? If it's the position of the Order, oughtn't something to be done? Not that Archbishop O'Malley (or, for that matter, the Pope) should start dishing out excommunications and anethemas like they're going out of style. But shouldn't someone take these guys aside and remind them, in a brotherly way, that these issues were sorted out 1,500 years ago?

      A: Unlike King,  he's still churning out books at an inhuman rate.    As true today as it was in the thirteenth century: popes are higher than kings.  I have to say I find the Pope's hyper-productivity simply astonishing. If I have one-tenth that guy's energy when I'm a Parkinsons-suffering septuagenarian, I'll be a happy, happy man. I'm really going to miss the guy when he's gone.  (link via  the Shrine of the Holy Whapping )

       Father Tucker raises the "how is the word 'nuclear' pronounced?" issue.  My two cents on this subject (not that anyone cares): why can't we just accept that "new-cue-lar" / "new-clee-ar" is just a difference of regional pronunciation, and move on? If  tomato  can be "toe-MAH-toe" or "toe-MAY-toe", and  aunt  can be "ant" or "ont"; if  broach  can be "brow-ch" or "brew-ch"; if  jewelry  can be "jule-ree" or "jew-ell-ree"; and on and on ad infinitum, why can  nuclear  be both "new-cue-lar" and "new-clee-ar"? It's clearly not an issue of clarity or confusion; when a Texan talks about "new-cue-lar wippens", you know he's referring to ICBMs, and the like. The insistence that "new-clee-ar" is the only acceptable pronunciation for the non-buffoon strikes me as nothing but snobbery, a desire to hold up Northern English as the one true English, with Southern pronunciations being some kind of degenerate dialect. T'aint so, suh, t'aint so.

      To quote the late, great Warren Zevon:  poor, poor pitiful me .   I don't usually blog about my job, because I don't think it would be especially interesting to anyone else, and also because I'm wary I might say something I regret. Working in criminal prosecution as I've been doing, I tend to see people who are, if not at their worst, at least in dire straits. I'd hate to speak ill of them, even anonymously, unnecessarily. I also don't want to say something about a judge or a prosecutor who I might need to ask for a recommendation at some point, and have it get back to them, and upset them. (For the record, I like and respect all the people I work for and with. Yes, even the public defenders.) The decision to suspend the above general rule of thumb was based on the important-moment-in-my-life status of today's events, and on a firm belief that no-one but myself would have an interest in keeping them undisclosed to the handful of people who actually read this thing.   I lost my first trial today. It was a motor vehicle case, a running a red light. I successfully proved that the defendant committed the  actus reus  (did the proscribed acts) and that he had at least the requisite  mens rea  (basically, the level of intent). Indeed, the defendant admitted, repeatedly, on the record, under oath, that he had run the red light. But, at the end of the trial, the judge decided, in light of the circumstances, to find the defendant "not guilty". I won't go into what the circumstances were here; if you're genuinely curious, email me and I'll try to get back to you. Suffice it to say they're nothing especially exotic; the defendant didn't run the red light while in pursuit of Osama bin Laden, or anything. But they were enough to get this gentleman off on the charges.  Losing my trial was a burr in my side most of the night. It stinks losing in general, and it was especially frustrating to lose after having proved everything I thought I was required to prove. Especially since the other intern in my office  won  his motor vehicle case, in front of the same judge, only yesterday. So I stewed over it for a while. But after a couple hours, and a big Chinese buffet dinner, and a few fine malt beverages, I feel better. Life goes on, I suppose, as will my illustrious internship. I have other trials to prepare for (not mine, don't worry) and a very busy day in courtroom A tomorrow.  Still, it would've been nice to get out of the gate 1-0 rather than 0-1.

      ...found while perusing IMDB for the previous post. Did you know that they're making  a fifth Batman movie?  It's a prequel, of sorts. Christian Bale, of   American Psycho   and   Reign of Fire   fame, plays the young Bruce Wayne. The villains? The Scarecrow, and Ken Watanabe as Ras Al-Ghul (how's that for color-blind casting!). The rest of the cast is legitimately star-studded: Liam Neeson, Michael Caine as Alfred, Katie Holmes as the love interest, Gary Oldman as then-Sergeant Jim Gordon, Tom Wilkinson, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer. No more muscle-bound Tyrolean future pols here. Perhaps the franchise is going to be treated seriously again. We can hope, at least.  Meanwhile, check out the IMDB plot summary for the upcoming Andy Garcia / Dustin Hoffman flick  The Lost City : Set in Havana, Cuba, during the 50's, a club owner is caught in the turbulent transition from the oppressive regime of Batista to the Marxist government of Fidel Castro. Castro's regime ultimately leads the club owner to flee to New York. I like the parallelism there.

       A live-action  Transformers  movie?  What fantastic news. The original, cartoon  Transformers  movie, the one with Unicron, Galvatron and the death of Optimus Prime, remains one of my favorite movies. I look forward excitedly to the Dreamworks effort.  If I may register a modest dissent from  Airdog , who first brought this to my attention, I'm not sure this is an overdue development. I think now is the right time. If they'd made a live-action movie about giant transforming robots back in the late nineties, the movie would have stunk. The effects-technology wasn't sufficiently developed at the time; the giant robots would have looked ridiculous (if you can believe that!). More importantly, the expectations of quality from superhero/sci-fi/fantasy/cartoon movies was far, far lower then. Movies of that sort were expected to be a little campy, poorly plotted, with some crazy costumes, lousy acting and one or two "exciting" set-piece action scenes.   Batman   was the exception;   Batman & Robin   was the rule. In the last 5 years or so, this "bigotry of low expectations" has largely eroded. There've been a number of genuinely high quality superhero or fantasy movies made since 2000. The  Lord of the Rings  series, the  X-Men  and  Spider-Man  movies,  Hellboy , among others. Sure,  they   still   make   lousy   movies   of   this   sort , but there are lame movies from all genres. The point is that it's been shown that you  can  make sci-fi/superhero/fantasy movies that  aren't  terrible.

      In the final episode of the season, Ken Jennings set the new single-day Jeopardy! winnings record. He won $75,000. The old record, which he had held along with at least one other person, was $52,000. Jennings had had the opportunity to break the old record in past shows, but had refused, betting just enough to tie. He was just toying with Alex, and with us. But on the final day of the spring '04 season, he pulled out his whuppin' stick and settled things. And set a record that no-one, not even Ken Jennings, is likely to surpass. Greatness at work.

      Kerry's "I believe life begins at conception" comment,  explained . You see, a foetus is "alive", it's just not "a person".   So: Kerry says that he's personally opposed to abortion because of his Catholic faith. But when you press him for details, he doesn't seem to believe any of the specific things the Church teaches about abortion. The Church teaches that one's personhood begins at the moment of conception, and that abortion is therefore a kind of homicide. Kerry doesn't believe either of these things, and will tell you so. Kerry may indeed be "personally opposed" to abortion, but whatever reason he has it's not because he believes what the Catholic Church teaches.  A dumb question: Why exactly  does  Mr. Kerry personally oppose abortion? To oppose something is, as I take it, to believe there's something wrong about it. So, Mr. Kerry, what precisely is  wrong  about abortion?

       ...in attempt to keep Anglican Communion from splitting.  The traditionalists may get their own church-within-a-church, with an all-male clergy. The immediate issue is the impending promotion of female priests to the Anglican episcopacy, though I can't help but think that recent dust-ups over the Communion's position on homosexuality (is it incompatible with the Bible? is it A-OK for bishops to be sexually active homosexuals? amazingly, the Anglican Communion seems to take both positions) played some role as well. The idea, I guess, is to give the traditionalists their own church within the Communion before they storm off and found their own outside of it. Gotta love Protestants; if there's one thing they're good at, it's founding new churches.  I wonder if this isn't good news for the Church. (The real one in Rome, not those wacky jokesters operating out of Canterbury.) If the traditionalists are formally organized as a group, it'll be easier to have them return,  en masse  to communion with the See of Peter. I can't believe that there's not going to be some movement in that direction, as the Archbishopric of Canterbury moves further and further away from the Christianity of their ancestors and becomes increasingly focused on  global warming  and  celebration of Jesus as "the complete person" . Sure, there'll be some who took fear of Rome with their mothers' milk who'll refuse to come back, but they'll come increasingly to be a small and isolated band in an ecclesial community that more and more resembles the Unitarians.  Not to be presumptuous, but may I recommend 2034 as a date? Precisely 500 years of Anglicanism will be, I think, precisely enough. And as a two-fer, we can finally beatify John Henry Newman that day too. When does  Luke 15:11  fall in that year's liturgical calendar? It'll all be such fun, that 20 years later we can do it again with  our Eastern brethren.

      It's the clear teaching of the Church that a person in a state of mortal sin should not receive the Eucharist. ("Anyone conscious of a grave sin must receive the sacrament of Reconciliation before coming to communion." - Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1385) But it's not always obvious whether one has committed a "grave" sin; many sins seem to me to lie in a gray area between the mortal and the venial. If you pig out an totally unnecessarily large meal, that's obviously just a venial sin. If you sleep with your brother's wife, that's obviously a mortal sin. But what about, say, telling a joke about someone behind their back? Mortal or venial? Or take lying. The Catechism is clear that some lies are venial sins and some are mortal sins. If you tell a woman her haircut looks nice when in fact it looks terrible, that's (I presume) a venial sin. If you tell a lie that puts others in danger (if, for instance, you tell Mike, falsely, that Tim is sleeping with his wife, hoping Mike will become enraged and beat up Tim) that's a mortal sin. But is it a venial or a mortal sin to tell a panhandler that you don't have any money when in fact you do?  Now, all this ambiguity and uncertainty is an excellent advertisement for the services of a spiritual director. But many people (the Fox included) don't have SDs, and even people with them are sometimes called to make on-the-fly spiritual decisions of this nature. (For instance, if you encounter and lie to the aforementioned panhandler on the way to Mass; unless your SD operates like one of those celebrity concierge services, you're going to have to figure that one out on the fly.) Which brings me (finally) to my question:  if you've done something that you think might be a mortal sin, but you're not certain and there's also a real possibility that it's a venial sin (or maybe no sin at all), should you or should you not receive the Eucharist?  When one is unsure of one's worthiness to receive, where should the presumption fall?  This is a tough one for me; there seem to be good arguments on both sides. On the one hand, respect for Our Lord's body would seem to counsel for erring on the side of not receiving. The Catechism, after all, reminds us that sacrilege against the Eucharist is especially grave. (2120) It might therefore make sense to establish a kind of buffer zone around the reception of the Eucharist, and not receive it unless one is really confident that one is free from grave sin. On the other hand, the Catechism instructs us that "It is in keeping with the very meaning of the Eucharist that the faithful, if they have the required dispositions,  receive communion each time  they participate in the Mass." (1388) That would seem to counsel against unnecessarily avoiding reception, which suggests that the presumption should be in favor of receiving the Eucharist, unless one is actually conscious of having committed a grave sin.  I mean this as an actual, and not a rhetorical, question. Anyone with an opinion on this subject, please feel free to email me.  In keeping with my secret plan to break the Internet through excessive blogging,  I'll post any future developments.

      In the meantime, may I recommend  this post  at After Abortion ( or you can just click on the original LiveJournal posting ). It's a charming account of the sadistic pleasure an abortion clinic employee took in reducing an 18-year-old girl to tears. Such are these dread latter days of the old violent beloved U.S.A. and of the Christ-forgetting, Christ-haunted death-dealing Western world, which somehow lost track of the idea of common decency and came to think it praiseworthy for a grown man to so abuse a young girl.

      In  this post  I make a boneheaded error while trying to correct a previous boneheaded error. Homophones, as we all know, sound the same but are  spelled  differently, not "sounding the same but being pronounced differently" as I wrote last night. Obviously, it's impossible for two words to sound the same but be pronounced differently. THIS IS THE LAST CORRECTION FROM THIS SERIES.

      I know I don't have any South Carolinian readers, but if I did I'd urge you to vote in the upcoming GOP senate primary for businessman Herman Cain over congressman John Isakson. Why have I taken a sudden interest in Palmetto State politics? Because I followed  a link  from the Corner over to  Southern Appeal  (scroll up) which described some of the dirty tricks and distortions Isakson is using against his opponent. The page also includes links  these   two  Isakson ads, where you can see for yourself the congressman's lame skullduggery.  I'm particularly peeved by the accusation, in the second ad, that Cain "donated money to pro-choice Senator Kerrey." Lame, lame, lame. A transparent attempt to take the fact that Cain, a former resident of Nebraska, donated money at some point in the past to his then-senator  Bob  Kerr e y, and make it look like he's a supporter of the current Democratic nominee. Clearly, Isakson doesn't respect the intelligence of South Carolina Republicans, and thinks they're rubes who will fall for his homonymic sleight-of-hand.  Like that rakish headline-writer over at  I Arbored Ann , I'm a good government type, so this kind of crap really gets my Irish up. For the good of the Republic, Isakson has to be defeated. So hie the hence, my nonexistent South Carolinian readers, to the polls, and vote Cain!

I have never seen anyone better at what he does than Jennings is at Jeopardy!. Not in sports, not in art, not in politics, or science.

      Here's a passage from a recent AP  urlLink campaign trail dispatch:     Bush also took issue with Kerry's pronouncement this week that he and running mate John Edwards ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) were proud of the fact that they opposed in the Senate the $87 billion aid package for Afghanistan ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) and Iraq ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ). Kerry said they had done so because "we knew the policy had to be changed."   "He's entitled to his view," Bush said. "But members of Congress should not vote to send troops into battle and then vote against funding them, and then brag about it."   Kerry's campaign responded that Kerry had served in the Vietnam War and questions linger about Bush's wartime service in the Texas Air National Guard.   "Considering that George Bush actively avoided combat duty and has pursued policies that have made the nation less secure, he is on very shaky ground when it comes to questioning the commitment that Vietnam vet John Kerry has to our national security," said former Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., a Vietnam War veteran and frequent Kerry surrogate. "This is just more attack-dog politicking by an increasingly desperate, partisan White House."   Let me get this straight: Kerry takes a position (voting against the $87 billion for Iraq reconstruction after voting for the war was the right thing, and he's proud he did it), Bush&nbsp;makes a substantive criticism of&nbsp;that position (saying: you shouldn't authorize invading a country and then vote against money for reconstruction and to equip the occupying army, and that  bragging  about doing so is unseemly), and Kerry surrogates&nbsp;reply to Bush's criticism how? By pointing out that,&nbsp;35 years ago, Bush served in the Air National&nbsp;Guard, whereas Kerry served in Viet Nam?  &nbsp;  Maybe I'm missing something, but "I served in Viet Nam" doesn't seem like an argument to me. I mean, maybe it's a response to a criticism of Kerry's character; if Bush were to say, "John Kerry doesn't care about the safety of America," Kerry could plausibly reply, "That's absurd: I went to war, put my life on the line in Viet Nam in to protect the safety of America." But pointing out that John Kerry did something brave and patriotic 35 years ago isn't really a response to a substantive question about his policy vision. I know I'm not the first to point this out, but it never hurts to call the Kerry campaign out when they pull this kind of crap.  &nbsp;  What makes this so insanely frustrating is that there's an entirely plausible justification for Kerry's votes. He could say, "I knew the bill would pass, so the troops would get funded. My 'no' vote was a protest against the abysmal handling of the postwar by the Bush administration." Or he could say, "I hoped that if we defeated the bill the Bush Administration would be forced to come to the Congress and consult with us, and that maybe by working together we could come up with a sane Iraq policy that will secure the country without putting our soldiers in unnecessary risk." Or any number of other things. Those would be  arguments  in defense of his votes. Instead, Kerry and the Kerrybots just say: "Kerry commanded a swift boat in Viet Nam! Ergo, Bush sucks! Case closed! La-la-LA-la-la!"

       Used tax shelters to avoid paying $600,000 in Medicare taxes back in '95.  Hey, we all make mistakes. Don't hate on Johnny E.   I say: let he who hasn't used tax shelters to avoid paying hundreds of thousands in federal Medicare taxes and then made a political career in part on castigating those same tax shelters for undermining the Medicare system cast the first stone.

       In keeping with the proud tradition of Reagan children embarrassing their late father,  the former president's son and namesake  will be speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Boston,  attacking the Bush Administration's restrictions on federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.  As best I can tell, Reagan is qualified to speak on this subject because he's the semi-famous son of a former president who suffered from a disease  that embryonic stem cells couldn't have treated.  I can see why the Democrats, being the more adult and serious of our two political parties, leapt at the chance to have him speak.  The whole business is a little ridiculous, it's obviously not going to impact the election. I am a little worried, though, because I have a strong sense that the pro-embryonic stem cell side (i.e.,  the Molochians ) is winning the debate. I understand how this is: opposition to research on embryonic stem cells has all of the pro-life cause, magnified many-fold. The victim is small, invisible to the eye, its humanity hard to grasp. The suffering of the other party - a woman with Parkinsons or a man with a severed spinal cord - is obvious and immediate. It's easy to sympathize with Michael J. Fox; it requires an act of the will to sympathize with a blastocyst, even for someone like me who's instinctively pro-life. And when one considers the quasi-miraculous promises made by advocates of embryonic stem cell research... well, it's not so hard to see why  even stalwart foes of abortion like Orrin Hatch have been seduced.  If people start thinking, inaccurately in my view, that "Reagan would have favored this research", it's only going to make the fight quite a bit harder.  sigh...  Oh well, the Carthaginians practiced child-sacrifice out of a belief that the polis would prosper and be well, and everything worked out fine for them.   wait.    Meanwhile, over at the Corner, Jonah Goldberg posts a reader email  pointing out that by having Reagan speak at the convention the Democrats are doing what they accused the Republicans of doing last month - exploiting the former president's death for political gain.

      The descendants of Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr  are going to reenact the famous duel on its July 11th bicentennial.  Unlike  Airdog , I think it's a neat idea. (I have a cousin-in-law who's a historical reenactor, so I have a soft spot for this kind of stuff.)   I blog on this story because the linked-to article contains this passage, which I found amusing, in an I-must-get-indignantly-irate-and-blog-about-this-right-now kind of way: Antonio Burr, a psychologist from New York, maintains his ancestor was the victim, attacked personally, not politically, by Hamilton, who refused to apologize. I know it's hard to think objectively about members of one's family, but after 200 years I would have hoped the Burrs would have gained some perspective. Hamilton was a jerk, yes, but he wrote the things he did about Burr  because they were true.  Burr and Hamilton dueled because they had been bitter political rivals for almost 30 years, ever since they'd been young officers serving on Washington's general staff. Hamilton hated Burr because he believed (correctly) that Burr an unprincipled cad who would betray the Republic to satisfy his ambition. Burr hated Hamilton because he believed (correctly) that Hamilton hated him and was determined to block his attempts at political advancement. The New York gubernatorial election of 1804 was just the straw that broke the camel's back.  Aaron Burr is one of the few indisputable villains of American history. In an age whose principal men were idealists sincerely devoted to the service of their country, he was a cynical operator, without principle, acting only to advance his own ambition. In the election of 1800, he allied himself with he opposition party to try to steal the election  from his own running mate . After the duel, Burr conspired with General James Wilkinson, governor of the new Louisiana territory, to invade Mexico and set up a "republic" with himself at the head. The conspiracy fizzled and Burr was tried for treason and acquitted (for insufficient evidence). He then went into exile (I like the  Congressional Biographical Directory 's euphemistic "went abroad in 1808") where he continued to lobby the princes of Europe to support his Mexican adventure. It's emblematic of Burr's opportunism that he petitioned both Napoleon and George III for help.   The only thing that can be said in praise of Burr is that he was a brilliant intellect. He is alone among the Founders in his entirely deserving reprobation. Even Benedict Arnold ranks higher in my estimation: before he betrayed the Republic, he was her greatest general; he won the Battle of Saratoga, without which victory there would have been no Republic to betray. I know not everyone feels as strongly about this as I do, but it's ridiculous for anyone, even a lateral great-great-etc-grandson, to believe that Burr was a "victim" who shot Hamilton because the latter was a big meanie who hurt his feelings. Burr was a bad dude for whom shooting his principal political rival was only one small part of a career of villainy.

      Fr. Paul Mankowski has  an interesting piece  on the threat posed by the rejection of  Humanae Vitae , and the attendant acceptance of contraception, to the authority of the Church and to the lives of religious Brothers and Sisters.  If the Church is wrong in  Humanae vitae , the judgment that it is wrong can only be made with reference to some standard. That standard, obviously, cannot be the Church herself; some contend that it is moral intuition, others a more academically respectable reading of scripture or of the history of doctrine; still others some comprehensive system of ethics or logic. But the crucial point is that whatever standard is taken as fundamentally reliable, this standard judges the Church, and is not judged by her. Here is the real revolution incited by the Pill; next to it the rise in promiscuity is a mere flutter. It's not about how many kids you have or don't have; it's about whether the Church can be led into error or whether  the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.  I seem to recall hearing that somewhere.

      THE SIMPLE PIETY OF  ROCKY . All weekend, AMC has been showing the  Rocky  pentology. Not a bad crazy idea, given the Rocky-Philadelphia-July 4th connection. I've never actually seen any of the  Rocky  movies all the way through before, so my knowledge of the series has mostly been limited to generalities - the basic plot of the series (Rocky loses to Creed, Rocky beats Creed, Rocky fights Mr. T, Rocky beats the Russian, Rocky is washed-up), the music (especially "Eye of the Tiger"), the iconic imagery (the steps of the Museum of Art).   Over the weekend, I've tried to catch snippets of the movies. I've actually been surprised by how good the sequels are - even the much-maligned  Rocky V . They're not brilliant, by any means, but compared to the dreck that's released today (or even then) they're more than passable. It's the  Godfather, Part III  syndrome: when you're following up on a classic, just being okay isn't good enough. So lay off Clubber Lang and Ivan Drago, a'ight?  The other thing that I didn't anticipate was the Catholic piety of the movies, especially the early movies. Rocky is always making the sign of the cross (which looks more than a little odd in boxing gloves). In  Rocky II , Adrian falls into a coma after giving birth to Rocky Jr. There's then a lengthy montage, with little dialog, showing Rocky caring for his incapacitated wife: Rocky reading to Adrian from an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel, stumbling over the words; then Rocky and Mickey praying quietly in an otherwise empty chapel; then back to the hospital room (where there's a cross over Adrian's bed and statues of Christ and St. Francis in the hallway); then back to the chapel; and so on. Just before his big fight with Apollo Creed, Rocky seeks out the advice of a priest in Roman collar. And in the moments immediately preceding the fight, while Creed is talking trash and shadow-boxing furiously, Rocky is silent, kneeling, praying. A remarkable contrast.   None of this seemed fake or tacked on. It all seemed to flow naturally from Rocky's character. He's a simple, decent man who projects a simple, natural piety. Rocky is not just the Italian Stallion; he's also il Cavallo Cattolico.  So I ask: why wasn't  Rocky II  included in the  Best Catholic Movies  online poll?

      WHAT A WEEKEND FOR ATHLETIC COMPETITION! On Thursday, I watched, in person, that epic 13-inning Yankees victory over the woe-begotten Fenway Franks. I was about a half-section away from where Jeter dove head-first into the stands while making the game-saving catch. Has there ever been so great a regular season game? (Hint: no.)  And now, I get to watch the women's Wimbledon finals, in which the beautiful Maria Sharapova (a.k.a. the future Mrs. The Fox) upset Serena Williams, 6-1 6-4. What a kid: after she wins, she gets on a cell and tries to call her mom; she's all smiles and giggling; she's a gracious winner, joking with Serena (who, to her credit, is a great loser, very dignified) and praising her. And she's home-schooled! I'm not a big tennis fan, but even I was taken in. What a match! And that Sharapova... hubba-hubba.  Also, is it just me, or does Serena's mom look kind of like Rick "Superfreak" James?      She's super-freaky, yeow!

He'll get crushed, of course, but his candidacy will make for some excellent debates. And it'll be nice to have a candidate speaking openly and passionately about social conservatism (especially abortion) to an audience that's not already basically convinced (i.e., the Deep South).

       Chris Caldwell on the Dems.  This stings: Perhaps most electorally harmful, given the personality-focused way campaigns are covered nowadays, was Teresa Heinz Kerry's paean to her own self-assertiveness, in which she was permitted to vent the delusion that hers is the candor of a feminist who had fought for her rights, rather than a billionairess who is simply used to being listened to. This is leaving aside her galling attempt to recast her upbringing in the upper reaches of Mozambican society under colonial dictatorship, and her education in apartheid South Africa, as human-rights credentials, rather than the opposite.

       "One Man Global Content Provider" Mark Steyn has a good piece on multilateralism-as-manacles.  Important to note that: After the Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, put the squeeze on Nato’s 26 members, they reluctantly ponied up an extra 600 troops and three helicopters for Afghanistan. That averages out at 23.08 troops per country plus almost a ninth of a helicopter apiece. Credit where it’s due, the three Black Hawks all come from one country – Turkey. But it wants them back in six months’ time.  Now I very much like Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. I’ve met him a couple of times before his present eminence, and he’s one of the most thoughtful of European politicians – well disposed toward America, not into stringing along with Chirac and the other Europoseurs for the sake of it. But he finds himself presiding over a sham alliance. Theoretically, it has millions of conscript troops at its disposal. But it has no ability to project more than a few thousand out of area – ie, to any of the places anyone’s likely to need them in the years ahead.  In other words, if a military alliance means a press release and a black-tie banquet for Bush, Chirac, Schroder and co once a year, Nato works fine. If a military alliance means functioning armed forces capable of fighting side by side and killing the enemy, Nato is a post-modern joke. The big burly Fijians who’ve done such a splendid job guarding currency convoys in Iraq have made a greater contribution than many of America’s supposedly “major” allies. And, from a cost-benefit analysis, they didn’t require months of endless diplomatic schmoozing by Bush, Powell, Rice and Rumsfeld, all consuming valuable time and money which, when you add it all up, makes it cheaper to add another 600 men to the New Hampshire National Guard rather than chase round a dozen European capitals trying to crowbar them out of Nato barracks.  Multilateralism isn't about increasing America's hard power. It's partly about increasing our soft power (even if they don't have any useful soldiers, there are an awful lot of Europeans, and their opinions do matter) though it's not entirely clear to me why the Iraqis would prefer their country be occupied by Crusaders and Zionists from many nations. More importantly, it's about constraining American freedom of action. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe it's not. (I lean towards not, but I'm open to discussion.) But that's what it's about, and anyone who tells you different is trying to pull the wool over your eyes.

       Nice  WSJ  piece.  Did you know that: According to a Zogby poll taken last month, 47% of Democrats oppose abortion except in the case of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother. Only 20% say abortion should be legal for any reason at any time during a pregnancy. To paraphrase a button being handed out at the pro-lifers' party this week: 47% of Democrats can't be wrong. That's less pro-life than me, but about as pro-life as Dubya. And yet the party leadership sticks to the dogmatic position that any restriction on the right to chose abortion, any way, any time, is anathema. What gives?   And yes, the GOP has the opposite problem - lots of pro-choice voters, but an almost exclusively pro-life (to some extent) national leadership. That's part of what's so queer about the issue: after about a decade in flux, the parties settled into ossified positions on the issue in the early 1980s, but no one seems to have bothered to tell that to the legions of pro-life Catholic Democrats and pro-choice mainline Protestant Republicans. I've come to think the opposite state of affairs, in which the Republicans are the pro-choice party and the Democrats the pro-life one, would probably be more natural, for reasons I won't discuss here, since I'd have to discuss them at length.   In other news...

       urlLink Orthodox, traditional and dangerous to know.  The guys they profiled remind me of the priests at my church,  urlLink St Mary's , where they have crazy things like confession every day (twice on Saturdays!), daily rosaries, weekly exposition of the Blessed Sacrament, Solemn High Mass Sundays at noon, etc. Y'know, Catholicism, and plenty of it.  There's also some interesting stuff at the end about that phenomenon  urlLink "known among Catholics as 'the bleeding'"  (to revive an old joke):  To solve the current priest shortage, many Catholics want to open the priesthood to married men. But conservatives argue that the major problem is inadequate recruitment. Not too shockingly, I'm in the "conservatives" camp here. I'm of that view for many reasons. One of them is that I think the "if only priests could marry!" line is founded on a premise that's simply false: that there are enough Catholic men out there who would become priests but for mandatory clerical celibacy that allowing priests to marry could "solve the current priest shortage". Does anyone really believe that there are thousands of such men in this country? Has anyone actually met one of them, a man who was convinced he had a vocation for the priesthood, but just couldn't follow God's call because he wanted to marry too badly?  Ditching mandatory priestly celibacy would throw a thousand years of Church discipline into disarray for what would be, at best, a marginal increase in the number of priests in the developed world. Just doesn't seem worth it to me. It's a quick-fix solution: change one rule, and everything will be better, without our having to make any real, internal change. The Catholic laity wants more priests, wants priests in numbers like in the old days, but for what? To perform weekday Mass for a few elderly women? To sit in the confessional waiting for the same half-dozen penitents while the rest of the congregation is out livin' it up in a state of mortal sin? And otherwise to sit quietly in their cells? Vocations have declined, ultimately, because the Catholic  laity  has allowed its faith to be weakened. Is it really harder to live a life of celibacy in 2004 than it was in 1904, or 1804, or 1504? Or is it that we're no longer raising Catholic men up to the challenge, or who see life in God's priesthood as worth the sacrifice? Vocations will only rise anew when the faith of the laity is renewed; anything else will be, at best, a band-aid. And in the meantime, we can always import good priests from India and Anglophone Africa.  You know what small (or perhaps not so small) thing might actually do some good on this score? If we to remember our Catholic sexual ethics. We commonly speak (as I have in this post) of priests as being required to be celibate, as if celibacy itself were one of the characteristics that separated the priesthood from the laity. And yet, of course,  all unmarried Catholics  are called to "celibacy"; it is just as much a sin (and a mortal sin, to boot) for a layman to have sex with someone who's not his wife as for a priest to do the same. What divides priests from laymen is that the former cannot  marry ; we might be better off to speak, not of "priestly celibacy", but of "priestly batchelorhood". For the faithful Catholic man, the choice is not between celibacy and the life of a swinging, 1970s-style ladies man, but rather between perpetual celibacy dedicated to the service of God and temporary celibacy while in pursuit of a wife. (Incidentally, a remembering of this notion might also do wonders to defend the Church's position on homosexuals, that those experiencing same-sex attraction are called to be chaste:  all unmarried people  are called to be chaste.)
