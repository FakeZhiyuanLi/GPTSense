      Best cheap stuff I have found on the Internet:   Cheap eyeglasses:    Go to your regular eye doctor, don't buy any of their stuff which costs three times as much as it should, and sit down with your prescription at www.39dollarglasses.com.  You learn how to understand and enter your own prescription (which is kind of educational).  It's run by real eye doctors, the prescriptions are right-on, and they have great frame styles.  Styles start at 39.00.  I got great-looking titanium frames for only 89.00!  The prices are great, service is great and they arrived in fine shape.   Cheap disposable diapers:  Found 'em on eBay, but the site is called www.diapers2u.com  urlLink  /  You can get 240 (that's 8 30-count packages) of disposable diapers, ANY SIZE 1 through 5, for 39.99 which INCLUDES shipping.  Can't beat that deal with a stick.  I've ordered from them thru eBay four times and only wish they stocked a size 6!  Saves not only huge amounts of money, especially for those big diapers, which you get fewer of in a package, as they get larger, but you don't have to constantly shlep big packages of diapers home from the store.  Bonus!   Cheap cereal:  OK, you have to kind of like it a lot, but you can get great deals on cereal by the case.  I've found cases (that's 14 12-oz boxes) of All-Bran cereal for $0.01 on eBay.  True, you do have to pay like fifteen bucks for shipping, but it still works out to a buck a box for cereal.  Also have found Product 19 by the case this way very cheap - and still within the freshness date.  Only weird thing is that the seller has removed American AAdvantage 100-mile coupons from the back with an XActo knife, so all the boxes have little translucent pouchy bulges.  Other than that, it's all good.   Cheap soymilk:  This isn't cheap initially, but if you ingest enough soymilk to where your wallet feels it, this is worth it.  Go to Google and look for the "Soymilker."  I think it's available from something called www.soyclub.com.  There are a lot of soymilk machines available out there, and this one's a little more expensive (was it $129 I think)?  But it is solid and beautifully made.  You literally dump the beans in the filter, add water, and press Start, and it cranks out 7 cups of soymilk in 10 minutes.  Does it taste like Silk or the other commercial brands? NO. Many prefer it plain or with the addition of a little vanilla and honey or brown sugar it makes quite a treat.  I like to strain my batches through a double-folded kitchen towel just to get it totally milk-like.  But here's the best part.  At 40 cents a pound at our local Asian food market, I'm making soymilk over here for 12 CENTS a gallon.  Compare that with 3 DOLLARS a half-gallon for Silk at the store.  Like I say, only go for this if you like the less processed versions of soymilk at the store (you know who you are), and are willing to take the chance.  I'm very happy with this maker.   Now, gotta pray.. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.  Dear Lord, if it is Your will to do so, I pray that you watch over Lil and her family, and that the outcome of her illness becomes better understood so that it can be treated and/or dealt with.  I pray for the souls of all the parents who have died in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  The description of children wandering naked and crying through the streets, calling for their parents, is more than I can bear.  I give it up to You, Lord, and I pray that they may be able to take shelter with sympathetic and caring grown-ups.  No matter what happens I know they are in Your hands.  Please be merciful with them, Lord, I pray.  And also I thank you for our four children, and my wonderful husband, and for the four days we have had together.  I thank You for my grandparents who I miss so much, and for my father.  I pray finally for my friend Ann.  If it is Your will that she should find a way to do her work and live with it, then I ask that it be so.  I pray these things in the name of your son, Jesus Christ, Amen.  In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

      Dear Jesus, If it is your will, please help my friend Ann to see what is important, to see what You want her to do.  I will also ask Your help for my friend Karen's mother Lil, who has fallen asleep at the wheel twice and whose family is very worried about her.  I pray that her troubles may be mended or that You will watch over her and help her family find a solution that works.

      If you sew, and you have a baby or know a baby, you have to check out New Conceptions ( urlLink www.newconceptions.com ).  The site is owned by a terrific lady (Kimi) who is also a remarkably clever designer.  She's come up with fantastic fitted diaper patterns that fit newborns up through toddlers (the famous PooPockets! pattern) as well as several other items--diaper covers, baby clothes, etc.  All incredibly practical, really well designed.  The PooPockets! pattern is particularly well done and requires no serger or special equipment.  She also sells fabric, pre-cut diapers to sew, and pre-sewn diapers to buy.

      Stop me from what I am about to write.  I can't believe I dreamed about you last night. I hardly ever think about you, and then you sneak back into my dreams. I forgot about it until about an hour after rising, then it came back to me in an embarrassed rush. All I can recall is exchanging heated longing looks and trying to find some place where we could be alone (happens so often in dreams). Couldn't find anyplace, which doesn't surprise me either - it's like the subconscious mind won't let me "go there." Anyway, it's foolish and frustrating, and I don't dare contact you directly about it, so there it is.  No use wondering about a road not taken. It was years and years ago, for God's sake! How ridiculous. The most ironic thing to me is that I don't seem to have much sex drive. Although that appears to be shaping up a bit lately.  So how can you have fantasies without any libido? They're mighty strange. I tried to describe it to my friend...It's like never being  hungry.  Imagine you once had a normal appetite: you remember at a gut level the taste, the smell, and especially the satisfaction and delight of eating dark chocolate, and now...you don't really want to eat the actual chocolate, but you still want the satisfaction and delight that you remember from it.  I read Total Joy and it helped some. I want to be a good wife to my husband. I want to be nice to him, take care of him, be cheerful, make good food for him, be a good friend to him, and give him love when he needs it.
