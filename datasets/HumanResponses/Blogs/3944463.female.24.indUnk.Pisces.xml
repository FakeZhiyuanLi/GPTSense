        after spent so much time on exploring "the blog" last night...finally went to sleep n woke up rather late. &nbsp; after that, i went out with my parents, 2 younger sis n nephew...go jalan2 naik lorry. kinda happy coz it's been quite a while since the last time i n my 2 younger sis get together like this since everbody were&nbsp;so busy with individual things. one thing i cant forget about today is....when we were at Tuas Ave 6 right aft out from "Hamid &amp; Sons showroom" we had to "tolak" lorry while my dad trying hard to start it and eventually the lorry got started than we went for dinner @ bukit gombak n the same thing happen again aft dinner so had no choice to "tolak" again....so kesian...luckily the lorry started otherwise dont know what will happen...maybe had to call abg muni to come and "rescue" us...alhamdullilah... &nbsp; and now while updating my blog, since everybody are again so asleep already but here i am still online n watching tv at the same time....cool huh (",)

          "Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful,&nbsp; and practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken."        &nbsp;   got the result by taking the "DrPhilTest.pps" sent by my fren, Martha. cool test. i got 38 points n it turns out to be whatever that i wrote abv.    kinda true though...but let it be "for me to know n for you to find out"...i guess for those who knows me should know how i am like if you really a re my true fren...;-) &nbsp;

       Alhamdullilah, buat pertama kalinya i attended KPJ n sekarang receive the sijil...but of course i hv lot more to learn...n i got 79.6marks for my mengaji course...also receive a gift for being at 2nd place for the KPJ in group performance. The ceremony happens just a couple of hours ago. Before everyone receives their individual gifts uztazah had a speech n we all had to make self intro since there are few newcomers...n when comes to one aunty...she makes all of us shed tears n we all rasa bersyukur dapat jumpa such uztazah that bimbing us attentively...n never felt bored with us. And whilst uztazah was reciting doa' we seems that felt so "insaf" for all that happening surrounding us that make all of us shed tears continuously....this has never so far happen to me before despite that i did attend such classes last time...I n my family felt so lucky to hv met such a wonderful "guru"...n insyaallah all of us will wanna master her skills so that there will be heir to continue the "_ _ _ _ _ " journey.     .....nau'zubillah himinzaalik...

       pheeew!.....finally my nephew has went to sleep. It takes me almost half an hour to watch him playing with my handphone n sling bag n finally he doze off. initial i was so frustated that he do not wanna sleep but i was fine aft a while i zikir for him n at the same time he was holding my sling bag on his arm n he goes to sleep eventually...so "naughty" boy...he seems want to have attention n make me "miserable" first before i can go to sleep. anyway, i cant be angry with him coz i love him more than i love myself....hehehe...      last 3 nights i was working n feeling so damn tired for having only abt 3.5 hrs of sleep while my sis had 8.5hrs of sleep.....shit....how i wish i could sleep long hours like her....but too bad i cant coz i had to pay attention on my nephew as soon as he wakes up...n than aft "entertain" him....n get him to sleep once again n that will be aft 3.30pm than i can do my housework etc n continues till its time for me to got to work.....that has been my routine ever since i started working night shifts...i was at times feeling a bit tired of having this kind of commitments but i dont have any regrets coz i myself make the decision to be fully responsible towards my nephew like how i took full responsible towards his late mom whilst i took care of her before she "left".....but to be honest ever since my nephew enter into our lives/my live, i have totally change on different perspective on a lot of things...well, its for me to know n not for u to find out...hahaha....but what i can say is that my life became happier n etc....n most importantly no stress....for me this is an extremely good experience for able to take care of new born baby n hopefully till he grown up "insyaallah" whislt i myself havent been married or even hv my own child....;)
