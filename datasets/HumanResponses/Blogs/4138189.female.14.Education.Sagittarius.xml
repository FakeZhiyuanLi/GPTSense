      Jeez school is kinda hard and swim is really hard! I practicly quit and my mom like freaked and was all dissapointed and shit w/ me so i kept doing it but not just for her but for me. I go tonight at 5:00 to figure out if i made it, if i didnt i am on the practice squad which means i can practice with the team and b part of the team but i only get to swim if some one if in-eligible (sp) or hurt so i guess its alrite i havent swam for along time before shadow's try outs started. The coach works everyone realy hard but for the people who have been like swimmin year around were fine. Yesterday we had to do a 200 i.m. and i had to do my 100 free' i was wiped out then i had softball practice then i went home at dinner and did my hw and eventualy fell alseep. 2mrw i have softball practice sometime during the day and i have a car wash for swim. My schedule is gettin hard cuz i have alot to do but o well i guess i'm handleling it the best i can. I hate getin up at like 6:00 every morning and havein to go to sleep at like 11:30.. BlaH!!! And omgsh clay is hot and he has a nice body and nice eyes. haha one more thing... *Jewtopia* lmao nice picture kristi! i loved it!!
