       urlLink    Ok... I'm trying to get more people to visit my site... so I will do anything.  This is a picture Rene took while I was toying with her Samsung E500 (she on the other end was having a good time playing with my LG. Period)  Right.  Anyhow...  she titled the picture "BlowJob Dix"... pretty self-explainatory.     nice? *blink blink*   It's my coming 3rd week with infinitus.  In summary, it had been really tiring week for everyone in Litigation.  Well, I not really complaining cos I enjoyed the work there.. explosure is really great and I get to lunch chris whose not too far away.  However, there's a huge change with the crews.  So... we have got a new secretary (Jolene)in last week.  She will be replacing Pricila and the company will have to figure out someone to fill up Doris place when she leaves on the 2nd... later this week.  Juriadah's back and a couple of new faces pop in now and then.  Pretty exciting. heh.  Can't wait for the Tuesday to come. :) Night.  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    My god... this is classic.  The specky guy standing on the right's my dad.  According to him, he was 12 at the time this photo was done... so we're looking at around 1953.  Sounds spooky but I looked literally the same when I was his age.  Good or bad.. my son will probably look the same when he's 12.        Poor boy.&nbsp; urlLink
