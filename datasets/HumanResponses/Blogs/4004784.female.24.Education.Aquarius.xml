      hola all,    last night, i went into boston to "see" the red hot chili peppers play at one of the DNC parties. unfortunately, the stage was blocked from the street and we couldn't see anything, but we chilled on newbury street and listened to one heck of a rock show. anthony keidis and company played an awesome set even though they left out my fave ("under the bridge")! didn't really see to many celebrities. saw a couple of people who looked like they were important.     i've been on vacation this week. it's been nice having nothing to do! and i finally had time to clear some stuff up with school - i am now officially a full-time student! :-) and i just got my registration information from the school of public health. i have to choose whether i want to take epidemiology or essentials of public health law - fun stuff! :-)    poor donna! hope your day got a lot better after that incident! at least no one (especially you) was hurt! oh, and i have been to newport, but only for work. it's a beautiful place to visit and i would love to get down there one of these days for non-work related reasons - i will actually be there on monday all day for meetings and interviews for work. (very exciting stuff). i'll pump some of the people i have to interview for places to visit in the area. i'll let you know if i find out anything interesting for ya!    all righty, it's time to hit the hay! it's exhausting living this life of leisure ;-) too bad it's back to the grind on monday...have a great weekend everyone!!!

      Today was going so well.&nbsp; I didn't oversleep.&nbsp; I hit no traffic on the way to work.&nbsp; The weather was beautiful.&nbsp; AND THEN...as I'm getting off the LIE at exit 49 S, it happens.&nbsp; I roll into a minivan.&nbsp; BAM!&nbsp; Just like that, I have become a statistic.&nbsp; I've never gotten into an accident before.&nbsp; The woman who was driving the minivan was stupid.&nbsp; She didn't roll down the window to talk to me.&nbsp; She just sat there and talked on her cell phone and CB radio, even though I was standing in front of her and waving for her to roll down the goddamn window.&nbsp; CB radio??? That's odd, thought I.&nbsp; I thought she might be some kind of work carpool service, because she had 3 non-related looking people in the van.&nbsp; Then I notice it - little writing on the side of the minivan - Helpers Assisting the Mentally Retarded.&nbsp; YEP, you guessed it!&nbsp; I hit a bunch of retarded people.&nbsp; LOVELY, the day is just getting better.&nbsp; So, she calls the cops, because its protocol, even though this is just a stupid little fender-bender, and my car was absolutely fine.&nbsp; Apparently, after waiting an hour, she realizes that she told the cops the wrong intersection.&nbsp; Ooops. The cops finally find us, maybe they were looking for the retarded people by the side of the road, I don't know how they did it.&nbsp; And then she decides to try to find her driver's license and registration - as if she didn't just have an hour to look for it.&nbsp; STUPID - what the hell did she think the cops were coming for, to play chess????&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; So the cops get the info, we all make sworn statements, blah blah blah.&nbsp; I get to work and apparently more than a few of my coworkers saw me on the side of the road, so they all teased me about being against retarded people.&nbsp;   I need to go to bed.

      Has anyone been to Newport?&nbsp; Dee and I were thinking of going at some point in the middle of August.&nbsp; We've never been, and I was just curious about things to do in the town, the museums, the restaurants.&nbsp; Someone in my office just got back from there and she said that she had a lovely time.&nbsp; I really really really want to go to check out the museums.&nbsp; I've been desperate to go see some of them since I studied this stuff in architecture history with caitlin!

      Good grief I agree, Krissy! I couldn't figure out how to get from the Blue Blog screen back to where you can post! I did figure out how to make Comments on the other posts, but then I realized you cant really see those! But anyway... Cait, great idea to set this up! :-) I think it's AWESOME! :-) Whatcha doin' on your vacation? I hope you do somethin' fun.  I can't wait...only 9 more days of work! Not that I don't like it, but...:-). Both my bosses were kinda crankie today, but then they cheered up after I got them to chase an errant grasshopper (yes a real one!) that was living on the other desk in the room where I sit!  Darn, it's only 8:23 and the sun is almost set! I CANT STAND WHEN THE SUN SETS EARLY! hehe.  Karen, your sister looked BEAUTIFUL! My goodness! What a cool wedding!  I also can't believe our lil reunion was over a week ago! I was so lonely after everyone left! There's really no one as good as all y'all that came to Shea and Bayville...other people really don't compare. :-)&nbsp; ("Cannn youuuu feeeeellll the loveeee toniteeee....") hehe, I am in a goofie mood, can you tell!&nbsp; Thank you to everyone for coming and to those who helped set it up, too! I love how we all just pop back together and it feels like we never were apart. Awwww :-) Anyway, Hello to all and I misss you! ;-) Love always, Deee ps - here is a funny story: at my brother and Karen's block partyu, my neph Joey drank droplets of soda and beer from the cans in the RECYCLING BIN! EWWWW! :-)

      The pictures from your sister's wedding were sooo pretty!&nbsp; I loved the cornflower blue color of your dress, you looked really pretty in it.&nbsp; You're sister was a very lovely bride - I wish I had dark hair like that, it looks so striking against the white veil.&nbsp; I can't believe how much taller than your sister you are.  In another note, I do believe that homecoming weekend is indeed Columbus day, because this is my birthday weekend also.&nbsp; So Dee and I were thinking of forcing everyone to go out to a club in Boston that weekend to celebrate, since everyone should be around for homecoming anyway.&nbsp;   Karen and Mike - I will get to see your apartment before 2004 is over, if its the last thing I do.&nbsp; I don't care how its done, but I am going to be in NYC until the end of January, and even if I have to make a special trip up there, I'm stopping by.&nbsp; (and in the morning, I'm making waffles!)&nbsp; LOLOL - too much Shrek for me.

      If you didn't pick up the reference in the title of this post, I'm watching "I love the 90s" on VH1, and they are playing that Blind Melon song ("No Rain") with the bee-girl in the video...   Anyways, yay to everyone who's signed up for the blog so far.  (BTW - Blog is short for Weblog!) I can totally relate to dealing with crappy people at work - my boss wants me to come in on my vacation next week to go to a stupid meeting. Not only does he want to  disrupt my vacation , he wants me to somehow transport myself from Medford through Boston and down to Newport during the Democratic National Convention. Yeah, like that's gonna happen!   Karen thanks for sharing the pictures from your sister's wedding. She looked absolutely beautiful and so happy! I'll get my hands on some pictures of Carolynn and Justin's wedding from Adam this week so I can post them for all of you.  I hope everyone is having a good week! It was great to see all of you this weekend! I just wish we could do it more often!!  Anyone read any good books lately?? I'm running out of reading material!!   ~Caitlin

      Hey everyone! I just wanted to thank Donna, Denine, Krissy, and Caddie for a fabulous weekend.&nbsp; I'm glad the wedding was in the morning so we could make it to NY on Saturday.&nbsp; It was good to see everyone, we should get together more often.&nbsp;   Speaking of getting toghether... Is everyone going to home coming?&nbsp; People are welcome to stay in Spencer with us, but I'm not sure if Mike and I will be around the whole weekend.&nbsp; My brand new cousin Amelie is being christened Columbus day weekend in NY city, I think that's the weekend of homecoming.&nbsp; I hope I'm wrong cause I'd love to have you guys hang out in Spencer with us, especially Donna since you've never been to Spencer before.  Not much going on around here.&nbsp; I just started tutoring kids for the fall SAT.&nbsp; I have one student whose prior SAT score is like 730.&nbsp; Hmmm...&nbsp; guess there's no where to go but up.&nbsp; I've been looking at the questions she got wrong and she misses REALLY EASY stuff, she could be a tough one.&nbsp; The other three girls are fun and pretty average students.&nbsp; None of the are thinking about HC, I'll have to work on that.&nbsp;  I also wanted to show you guys some pictures from my sister's wedding.&nbsp; Hopefully this link works &nbsp; urlLink http://www.barkerweddings.com/new_photo.asp?id=1611 &nbsp;.&nbsp; If not go to barkertavern.com then select weddings, then recent wedding and the pictures are under Patrice O'Sullivan or John Grace.  Hope all is well with you guys. Karen

      Hey folks!  Wow...this is neat; I've never visited a blog before.&nbsp; What does "blog" stand for, anyway?&nbsp; ...It sounds like something Shrek would excrete after dinner!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; j/k  I hope everyone is enjoying a fine week.&nbsp; Work at the Cross has been busy...we're finishing up the writing, editing, etc. for the upcoming "Report of Giving" (which is published every Fall).&nbsp; Next week, I'll be attending a Development conference at Dartmouth College in Hanover, NH -- that should be cool!&nbsp; I'm absolutely amazed at how bustling the HC campus is...I&nbsp;thought it'd be a "ghost town" after the students left for the summer -- certainly NOT the case.&nbsp; There's been tons of camps the past few weeks...basketball, football, lacrosse, field hockey, cheerleading...and even an academic camp for Woo-ville&nbsp;middle schoolers (which my colleagues have dubbed "nerd camp!").&nbsp; Needless to say, Mt. Saint James has become "the place" to be this summertime!&nbsp;   Oh, one more thing:&nbsp; Tomorrow, I should have my pictures developed from last weekend's mini-Reunion.&nbsp; I can't wait (...I HOPE the picture of the Shea Stadium jumbo-tron comes out!).&nbsp; Yee-Haw!&nbsp;  Have a great&nbsp;rest of the week!  --Caddie :-)&nbsp;

      Hey guys,  I am really looking forward to the HC mini-reunion this weekend!! Thanks so much to Caddie, Dee, Donna, and Krissy for organizing it!  I was thinking about how blogs seem to be popping up everywhere. I was also thinking about how much I was looking forward to seeing everyone this weekend and how it's a shame that it gets so difficult to keep track of everyone and to catch up with everyone. Sooooo, I thought that creating a team blog where we can all post anything and everything we want seemed like a great idea.   I hope you guys agree!  Sign up and have some fun!  You can post pictures and everything here too!  ~Caitlin

Sadly, philly - i got your message yesterday but i can't make it to the party because it's my gram's birthday and gilberto is coming in.  gotta have some good old family fun.

      So, this is my last message from Lamb and Barnosky's computer system.  I feel sad, I liked this place a lot, everyone I worked with is really friendly.  I'm going to miss them.  I have about 20 more minutes to sit here and look occupied, and then I'm going to my final "de-briefing" meeting and shutting down my computer forever.  I can't believe how fast the summer went.  I had an awesome summer.  I'm glad that we all got to see each other and that Caitlin set up this blog - it's a great way to keep in touch.  Hey, now that I'm in NYC until the end of January, you guys should invite me to Massachusetts to hang out more.  It's only 4 and half hours as opposed to 6 and half from Ithaca!  Seriously, though, I miss you guys and it's always a good time.  I'm seriously thinking about coming this weekend Phil.  No worries though, if Jon and I come, we'll bring our own sleeping things.  It really depends on the weather, and on whether I get my job stuff mailed out in time.  (Yes, shockingly, I am starting another job search, but this one is for after graduation - SCARY!)  Anyway, hugs and kisses to everyone, you may see me tomorrow, you may not!

      Donna Ann, If I promise Checki won't be there, will you come?? But honestly, the boy should come with you.  We all love him, especially Mel.  Melly loves him extra, don't you baby ;p Anyway, I hope everyone can make it and I will make any party concessions you want, such as all Madonna music, or no fruit on the buffet table.  Looking forward to it!! Hehe  Just as a word to all, attendance is highly suggested  Miss you all!

      Howdy all,   I just wanted to congratulate Cait on quitting her job!  I also wanted to answer Donna's question about Phil's party.  Mike and I will be there, Tommy O will be on the Cape spending his last days before becoming a priest with his family.  Timmah is undecided I think.  First, he really wanted to go to the John Williams concert at Tanglewood, then when I said Mike and I would be going to Phil's he was going to go to Phil's.  Now he's talking about going to the Cape but stopping at Phil's on the way.  I kindly pointed out to him that the north shore was in no way on the route to the cape from the Worcester area.  So who knows what Timmah will do.  Phil's parties are always a good time, so I would highly recoomend going if at all possible.  Lots of people usually arrive like Checky, Rob Hymas, Brendan... people that we don't see very often.  I plan on spending the night at Phil's too (Phil hope you knew that already).  I just want to point out that Mike is currently sitting on the couch watching his third episode of A-Team in a row.  Yes, he owns Season 1 on DVD.  How is that entertaining?  I don't get it.  Hey Caddie... Mike was supposed to call you and ask you about this, but with his excellent procrastination techniques I doubt he has.  Anyway,  we are going to Chicago August 17 through August 22.  Are you going to be working in the Worcester area during that time?  Would you like to feed Bad Kitty?  Let me know either way.  Thanks.  So have a good Wednesday. It's a payday for me . . .  woo-hoo!  Karen

      Hey Baby, you rock, no worries.  It'll be better now that you quit your job.  You can finish school faster and get into an area where you really have some interest, rather than wasting more time doing something that doesn't really make your motor run. Besides, as soon as I become a high-powered and extrememly influential lawyer, I'll lend you some money for all you do-goodings.  Karen, your story was kick-assedly funny.  I laughed out loud on several occasions, because I had such a mental image of the whole three-ring circus that you were describing.  I love it!  It totally brightened up my afternoon.  Hey - I end work on Friday!  New job for the fall semester starts in 2.5 weeks - wish me luck!  P.S. - what's the deal with Phil's thing?  I don't know if I'll be able to go yet because Jon's supposed to be coming down, but who is/isn't going?  If I'm boyfriend-free, I'll probably stop by.

      cait - that is scary news! but probably the best thing to do! i wish i could quit and go to school full time!!!! (but at this point i think its too late for me!) but congrats on havign the guts to do it!!!! how many classes will you take now?   as for those stories posted on the internet - philly already has the costume to be the jester!!!!! annnnnnd, i think they should make a no toe licking law. as u all know i am very anti feet and no toe licking is indeed the first step to a better world! in news of my own, this week is my last at camp - camps quickly ending and im happy about it even though i LOVE having my own classroom i LOVE the thought of three weeks of vacation better!  work starts again on september 8th - although i will have to start my classes again sept. 1...... ahhh well.  in other news i came home and stepped in dog shit today - not so exciting news but gross so i wanted to share. damn dogs. ok time for a nap before the girls drag me out to the bars.....feels like senior year.... love to you all!

       I resigned from my job today!  I think I must be crazy! My last day at work is September 2nd - only four more weeks!  I decided to go to school full-time this year. I'll be able to get both my degrees done faster and cheaper this way. BUT the thoughts of being unemployed are scary. I have to do an internship this year, so I guess in some small way, I'll sort of feel like I'm still working.  So, this is half exciting and half scary. I'm gonna go take my mind off of my anxiety now!

          yeah karen all dogs instinctively know how to swim but my dogs are too butt heavy and their muscles aren't strong enough to combat the big butts and they slowly and surely start to drown.  plus they can't get out of the pool so it's a big problem.   donna - i LOVE that song by beenie - but the line is tie me to the fan not time me to the fan.... other than that i now have that song in my head. but it's better than other songs you can get in your head i guess. like the other day i was thinking about hc and everything and had that "the female of the species" song in my head - now i can pass it on to all of you. hope everyone is having a good weekend... im off to find some excedrine. love k

       Hey everyone,       I haven't been reading bloggs lately so I decided that I should today.  My a lot has happened.  I'm really sorry Donna.  I hate getting into accidents (ok so I've been in like five, only one was my fault), the worst part of accidents for me is the fact that I actually start shaking because I get soo freaked out.  I too am glad everyone was ok and that your car was fine, the next most annoying part of accidents is having to deal with your insurance company and fixing your car, so I'm glad you avoided that.  Caitlin- I'm glad you enjoyed your vacation, sounds like the concert was fun even though yoyu couldn't see the stage.  Krissy- I'm confused about having to rescue your dog.  Can't all dogs swim, hence the doggie paddle.  I understand the not being able to get out of the pool part, just sorta confused.  Caddy- Christams in July was fun.  A good time was had by all.  It was good to be able to talk to people that I alomst never see like Brian Larro.  Anyway, thanks for having us all over.   Ok so the real point of my blog was the adventure I had in Cambridge last night.  Timmah, Tommy O, Allen, Mike and I went into to Cambridge to see Open Water.  Not such a great movie.  It was very predictable I mean a woman and her husband are trapped in the middle of the ocean what do you think is going to happen to them.  Well it happened to them for like an hour and a half.  Not very thrilling and a crappy ending.  But the adventure of the night was getting into and out of Cambridge.  Timmay has a fabulous new Honda Civic.  It's a pretty blue and can actually fit five people unlike my car or Mike's which claim to fit five people but one of them must be a  baby midget.  So Allen,  Tommy O and I sat in the back with Tommy O riding bitch.  Allen made his ridiculous comments as always, but because I haven't seen him all summer they were actually funny.  Well, Timmah does not like to drive in the city and has issues with it in general.  Allen was giving Timmah directions and told Timmah to take the wrong left, now most people would just try to drive around the block, but there wasn't a block and this pissed Timmah off because we were obviously lost.  One wrong turn.. not a big deal.  This erupts into all of the males in the car shouting directions at Timmah.  Timmah gets more stressed out.  After driving for a while we end up by Harvard ... not where we wanted to be, infact far away from where we wanted to be. So we turn around, but this stresses Timmah out more and now Tommy O is convinced he knows the best way to get there even though Mike has taken over giving directions.  When Mike does not give the same directions as Tommy O, Tommy O gets very annoyed and can't understand why we're sitting in traffic (which consisted of having to stop at lights, not a real traffic problem) because if we went his way we would be there by now.  Quite Entertaining watching Timmah and Tommy O stress each other out.      After the car ride we go to the movie theater, buy tickets then go out to dinner.  Dinner was only slightly entertaining because Allen wrote on the check that our waitress was hot.  Well, Tommy O agreed she was hot, but he was upset because "YOU CAN'T WRITE THAT!"  And fought with Al for the check trying (unsuccessfully) to somehow remove what Al had written.  It was mildly entertaining.  Then we went to the movie, which was quite boring and predicatable.       The ride home... Where all the fun was.   Again, Tommy O rides bitch in the back with Allen and I.  Well Tommy O couldn't get his seat belt to buckle and proceeds to announce to me "I can't get it in"  Classic Tommy O statement. So funny, because I have to point out to him what's wrong with that statement, maybe it's a good thing he's gonna be a priest.  The directions issue and Timmah's stress about driving in a city arrises again.  Timmah break all kinds of laws by driving across a street just to drive through the parking lot of a gas station so he can make an easy left turn onto a street which is one way in the other direction.  Luckily Timmah realizes that it's a one way street first.  Then Tommy O proceeded to tell us of a story where he left Boston with Donna and Denine and drove the wrong way down the same one way street.. didn't that happend in Hyannis?  Hmmm.. maybe Tommy O shouldn't drive in places with one-way streets.  The rest of the ride home was mildly entertaining, Allen continued with his comments, but nothing beats Tommy O's statement.  Anyway just thought you'd all like to hear about it. I know my story went on and on, but it was a fun night.  Hope everyone enjoys the rest of the weekend.

      I just read in the Boston Globe that Washington state has legalized same-sex marriage. Washington is one of the 38 states that had ruled marriage is a union between one man and one woman, but a judge in Seattle ruled that denying marriage to these couples is a violation of their constitutional rights.   urlLink Click here  for the link to the article.

That's horrible! im with cait in that im glad nobody got hurt - i could make some bad retarded jokes right now but i wont.  so here's my day - just to make u feel a little better but it's not as bad as yours!!! Today i was swimming some laps to cool down after such a hot day (and MAN WAS IT HOT! No ac and no fan at work makes for one unhappy krissy!) anyway...i was swimming and was in the shallow end - and my dog fell in the deep end.  well i panicked and set out after him and got him out in the nick of time - but not without twisting some muscle in my back because of how i turned and how hard i was pulling to get there in time since he can't get out of the pool.  but all is well.  ahhh yeah, and there was a frog in the pool too.... it's like my own little zoo!  this is my last week of school for the summer.... then one week of work and 2 of vacation! yippee.  went to a comedy club in the city on friday which was really great.  it was only 15 dollars and with a computer printed coupon it was 2 for 1 with no drink/food minimum.  annnd the comedians were funny and the show was long. anyway, i liked it - dee and d we should go one day.  that's all i have to say. got to search the net for lessons on "america's monuments" = anyone got an idea cause i ahve none. love to you all! kris
