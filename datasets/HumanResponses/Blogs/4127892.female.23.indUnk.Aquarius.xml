      There are numerous websites online devoted to finding a penpal. You can write to someone halfway around the world, someone in the military stationed overseas, or someone that doesn't even speak the same language as you.  You can even write to someone in prison.  I don't know what the attraction is for people on the outside to write to people that they don't know on the inside. People who are locked up and away are generally done so for a reason: they are dangerous. I know that we all get a little lonely now and then, and everyone likes to feel that they are understood by another human being, but i've never felt like I had so few options out in the real world to communicate with that I felt I had to start sending letters to someone that lives in a space the size of my walk in closet.  With BARS.  I had an aunt - a stepaunt, really - that actually met and married a guy in prison. Her name is Carolyn and she is crazy and I am secretly thankful that I am not related to her by blood. I was 10 or 11 when she had the wedding and I remember it because I was there. Her husband, a guy named Keith, was in prison for various things - theft, arson, drugs, etc. I'm sure, like Aunt Carolyn insisted, that he was a GREAT guy, that he had learned from his mistakes and deserved a second chance.  But getting married to a guy in prison is a little wierd. What was the point? They couldn't have watied another 18 months for him to finish serving his sentence so they could have a real wedding, complete with alcohol and followed up with sex in a real bed instead of a tiny cot in the corner of a room with a bunch of guards peeking in every so often?  I wore a flowered pink dress. It was the same dress that I wore for everything until I grew out of it, which unfortunately took me awhile as I am a slow grower. I was bored throughout much of the "ceremony", and if memory serves me right, I sat on a bench in the same hallway that the "wedding" took place in, next to an armed guard, with my arms folded and sulked. Aunt Carolyn marched down the hallway with Guns 'N Roses' "Don't Cry" blaring from an old beat up boom box. They exchanged their vows, their plastic rings (both bought out of one of those little toy machines for roughly $2.00 each on account of several attempts to get just the right ones), and then kissed each other in such a way that my mother felt the need to cover my little sisters' eyes.  I don't really remember anything else, except for the guard asking if the lady getting married was my mother. I told him that no, she was my aunt, and the guard patted me on my knee and said, "Thank God for that."

      The dictionary defines the word "talent" as "a marked innate ability" and "natural endowment or ability of a superior quality".  I wish I had some kind of talent.  The list of things that I cannot do is numerous:  Dance Act Sing Paint Juggle Do a cartwheel or handstand Turn my eyelids insde out Chug beer Imitate famous persons Cheat at cards Lie convingcingly Make jokes that are funny and universally understood  The list goes on and on. I am not double jointed anywhere. I do not have the lung capacity to hold my breath for any large amount of time. My memory barely works well enough to remember where I parked my car at the mall, let alone recite something as long as The Gettysburg Address or the Declaration of Independence. I can't even belch out the ABC's.  I once watched a program on television where a young man was featured because he could take any word you gave him and instantly rearrange the letter into alphabetical order. I was amazed. And jealous. What I would give to be able to do that! Just think, if my grand plans of suddenly being "discovered" while wearing sweats at the supermarket or meeting the rich Dr. of my dreams after I trip in front of him and he catches me ever fell through I would have the alphabetizing to fall back on. Some people make lots of money standing on streetcorners all day.  I hate to watch tv or listen to the radio these days. Everywhere I turn, there is another glaring, blaring example of just how talentless I truly am. I didn't publish my first novel at the age of 18, that ended up being such a smash hit that they're now making a movie about it. I never recorded a double platinum album three times over and sold out every single concert on my world tour. I haven't been awarded an Oscar, haven't been allowed to make my teary acceptance speech that i've had written in my head for years. I haven't even invented anything useful like the table that has a dishwasher built into it, or the bagel that includes the cream cheese inside.  I am a failure.  What I have done, in the multitude of moments I could have been using to research my perhaps hidden talent, is watch almost every single ER episode. And Oprah. I would say Dr. Phil, too, but he has too many of those "families in crisis" shows and I don't care for those. I have arranged and rearranged my CD's in order by last name, first name, color, time I bought the cd, how many times I listen to the cd on an average basis, and whether the cd is "cool" or not. I have taken more naps on the couch with my dog than is probably advisable. I have eaten an entire box of chocolates by myself in one sitting and not even felt the least bit guilty about it, fallen asleep in the bathtub, and spent hours wandering around Wal-Mart wishing I had more talent so that I could earn a better living to buy more crap at Wal-Mart.  Probably I do have some kind of talent. If I wasn't good at something, than I wouldn't be good at anything, and that would make me an absolute nothing. It is also quite possible that maybe I already know what my talent is and I don't like it, therefore I don't practice it. Maybe i'm really good at holding peoples' hair back when they're drunk and vomiting, or i'm a great candidate to be the local park's pooper scooper picker upper. Maybe just because I have a talent doesn't mean that I want to utilize it.  Of course I could say that I'm talented because I have an opposable thumb, and can communicate in sounds other than clicks and grunts, but maybe that makes me sound egotistical and judgemental, like I am better than those dumb monkeys in the zoo picking the nits and lice out of each other's fur and the stupid dolphins who allow themselves to be tricked into jumping through hoops for a few measly bits of dead fish. So, obviously modesty is not a talent I have fully mastered as of yet.  But I have lots of time to work on it, and i'll get to it. Right after I take my nap and watch another hour of Oprah.

      I sometimes think about the people of my past. Not about Amelia, my best friend from the fourth grade, the one who wore more slap bracelets than anyone else in our class and knew the words to every Debbie Gibson song on the radio. Not about Glenn, my first ever boyfriend of 1 week in the seventh grade, the boy with red hair and freckles who eventually dumped me via a hastily written note left in my locker. It read, "I can't be your boyfriend anymore. It's not you, it's me. Let's still be friends." I don't even think all that much about my best girlfriends from highschool, the ones that knew every detail of my first tongue kiss, let me copy their biology homework, and allowed me to mooch rides off them to the mall when I was without wheels of my own.  Instead of wondering what ever happened to the people that were once close to me, the ones that helped shape my life in at least some small way, I mostly think of the strangers whose paths I crossed for perhaps only a moment or two.  Like the lady I met once while cashiering at a retail store with the freakishly long fingernails, for instance. Her nails were so long they had curled around the tips of her fingers and were starting to make what looked like a spiral. She had each nail painted a different color. Blue, green, red, orange. She had to ask me to unbuckle her wallet and dig around for the $4.26 she owed me. It was unbelieveable. I asked her how long she'd been growing her nails that way and she told me almost a full year. After she had left the store, I thought about how she wrote out checks to pay her bills, or tied her shoes in the morning. When I think about her now, I wonder whatever happaned to her. Are her nails still long, still growing, still each painted a garish, bright color? Or did she tire of them and trim them down to a manageable 4 or 5 inches? Did she ever develop any kind of nail fungus? Did she get into a horrible accident and have to have her hands surgically amputated? If so, did she suffer some kind of an identity crisis or simply start on growing out her toenails instead?  And what about what's her name - something that starts with an "S".  Sally or Sharon or something like that?  The woman I used to work with when we worked at the answering service up north?  She always smelled horrible.  She blatantly picked her nose and always had a cold.  No one liked to get stuck at the cubicle next to hers.  Fortunately for everyone else that we worked with, that poor soul was me.  In between calls Sally-Sharon would push her chair over closer to me and try to engage me in conversation, usually ones referring to sex.  I hated to think of any man having sex with her, and actually hated even more to think about what that man must smell like himself, so I tried my best to politely ignore her.  I also didn't want anybody to think that she and I were friends.  But I have to wonder if anyone ever mentioned to Sally-Sharon that she had a personal hygiene problem.  Someone from the HR department, maybe?  Did they call her upstairs and have an intimate discussion with her or just stick a bar of soap in her Christmas stocking?  Was it possible that Sally-Sharon had some kind of medical condition that caused her to stink all the time, to constantly sneeze and pick her nose?  Or did she suffer some sort of horrible accident as a child that damaged her olfactory cells, leaving her without a sense of smell forever?  Did she have allergies?  Is there some kind of mental illness that drives a person to dig for gold up their nostril for 8 hours a day?  I don't even want to think about what she did when she hit pay dirt.  And finally there's the man i'll affectionately refer to as "Al".  He was a drunk.  A happy drunk, but a drunk nonetheless.  He used to come into the store where I worked and ramble on about the Korean War, how that was a war that was truly forgotten. Depending on his mood, the time of day, and how many people Al thought were listening, he would tell me that he had been repeatedly  shot, stabbed, beat up and left for dead in some unknown jungle, or taken as a POW for 3 years before he managed to escape.  He swore that he had written a book about his experiences, that it had shot to the NY Times Bestseller's List for a very brief time before the government stepped in and destroyed every remaining copy.  Al supposedly lost everything because of the big, bad government - everything, that is, with the exception of his penchant for alcohol.  And now, looking back I have to wonder if Al is still out there, telling his story to anyone who will take a few minutes to listen.  Or is he in jail, writing to his penpal?  Was he ever locked up and diagnosed with PTSD at the least and schitzophrenia at the most?  Is he still alive, even?  Was he ever in a war at all?  Was he ever in the military?  And just what if his stories are true, and the government really did put a stop to his writing career?    Some things, like how many licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie roll pop, the world may never know.

      I am lonely. I want a boyfriend.  I haven't actually "dated" dated for, oh...., about 3 years or so. I've "hung out" with guys, lusted after guys that wouldn't give me the time of day, and even somehow miraculously managed to have sex with a few of them, but it was never anything serious or meaningful or fullfilling. Actually, it all made me feel kind of cheap and worthless in the long run. I guess i'm not one for much casual sex. Hey, it's not for everyone.  Since I haven't had a true boyfriend in awhile I spend a lot of time romanticizing the entire idea of having a significant other. In my fantasies, my imaginary boyfriend loves the same movies as I do. He likes to cook for me, and takes out the trash without having to be nagged about it 300 times. He massages my back after a particularily hard day at work, and at nighttime we lay in bed reading books aloud or working on crossword puzzles.  In reality, though, I know that having a boyfriend is not all it's cracked up to be. There's the jealousy factor, and all the insecurities that come along with it. There are the boys' nights out to contend with (and obsess over what they are really doing) and the dirty clothes everywhere except the hamper to argue over.  In a relationship you have to wonder about how the other person will feel about any given decision that you make. You have to compromise with each other. You have to exhibit a certain amount of empathy and understanding, or at least master the art of pretending to care.  Lately, i've been wondering if maybe i've lost all of these vital girlfriend-material skills. Do I have what it takes to make a relationship work? Is being an attentive and supportive and loving partner like riding a bicycle, something that once you've successfully mastered (no matter how brief) you never lose, or is it more like learning a foreign language, with practice making perfect?  If I had a boyfriend right now my life would be so different. I wouldn't be able to stay in every Friday and Saturday night watching movies like "Steel Magnolias" and painting my toenails. I wouldn't be able to go for weeks without shaving my legs, even though I do live in sunny Florida and can practically wear shorts year round. I would have to get out of bed a half hour earlier each day to do something more with my curly hair, and it probably wouldn't hurt if I glanced in the mirror to be sure my clothes matched.  But then again, if I had a boyfriend right now, I would have someone other than my dog to pour out my troubles to. I would have someone in my life other than my mother to tell me how special I am. Maybe, with the help of my boyfriend cuddled up next to me on the couch, I could get through "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (possibly the scariest movie of all time) without almost pissing my pants and jumping out of my skin.  And the sex! Let's face it, I am 23 years old. Sex is on my mind constantly even if I don't show it. I like sex. I miss sex. Hell, I wouldn't mind having sex right now.  I'm not sure why it is that i've been boyfriendless for so long. Being a girl, of course the first thing that comes to mind is that I am quite possibly ugly and/or have a horrible personality. But I know that this isn't true. Plenty of guys flirt with me, and I get more than my fair share of second glances (not that I keep a running tally or anything). Most likely my timing is off or something. Since moving to Florida, i've been so wrapped up in my job and trying to straighten my life out that I haven't felt like being as social as I could be. And there are other, more complex and deep seated reasons for my being single, I guess, but it's too early in the morning to try to explore those angles.  I guess for now I will just have to tell myself that a relationship isn't in the stars for me at this time, that the good men in life are worth waiting for, no matter how long and torturous the damn wait is.  Or I could take up lesbianism, I guess. Some loving is better than no loving.

      So, I have a blog.  Again.   I suppose I should mention that I am a serial blogger, famous for starting a half dozen blogs with a bang, and then over a short period of time allowing them to fizzle out, leaving my readers with a sense of profound loss, I'm sure.   But, ever the firm believer in second chances (and sometimes third and fourths), I am willing to give this blogging thing another try, and this time to try to see it through until the end.  Until the end of what, you ask?  And my answer to that question is to sit down, shut up, and stop asking stupid questions.  Jesus.   I am on the internet every day, so it's quite possible that I will update at least that many times.  But don't hold your breath.  My life is fairly uneventful on any given average day and so there's not always a lot to say unless you are willing to read about how many loads of laundry I have yet to fold or whether or not I vacumned before dusting.   Ok, well, that is enough for now.  I don't want to fun out of steam on my first entry.
