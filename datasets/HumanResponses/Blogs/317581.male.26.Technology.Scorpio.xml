      Well, it's been about a week since Cliff left for spain:( I want him to come home and play with us, but I hope he's having fun. And now Marc leaves in like 3 weeks for Australia:(  On the upside, I have music to listen to today. I got a bunch of MP3's copied onto a CD before I left this morning, so I have the new Cake, Alien Ant Farm, some Green Day and Dynamite Hack. It's so nice to not have to listen to this game:)  Also, the more I read of "Youth in Revolt" the more I like it.  Dej- do you have this alleged "Last Unicorn"? I would like to read it. :)

      What do you think about as you drift off to sleep?   Usually, I'm just like going over stuff in my mind and then I can't even remember it the next day. Sometime's I contemplate life and other times I just appreciate the people in my life. But then I just lie awake for hours:)  You know, I think the best thing in life is friends and family(aka relationships):) Check you guys later, and cahlen, enjoy your sleep...

      I suppose it's all just different ways of looking at the same thing.  I suppose I'm a romantic.  All I really think we can do is keep our minds open.

      So, I guess my point was, I can talk until I'm blue in the face about nothing, I just don't see the point, but I'll indulge you...  So, we can't really tell if we're real or not, Suppose we're a computer program, God know's we're running simulations of our earth on some super computer right now. It has these scripts(people) and they come together and make a blank script, then they add there parts to the new script(babies) then these scripts grow and learn and question, then commune with other scripts. The program runs, the scripts don't know any different, they're all living in their world. Perhaps there used to be users that interacted with the program(the greek gods?) Perhaps the last user to interact with our particular program(They have lots going of course) was Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Suppose there's other users that decided to stay in the program but just be watchers that jump in occasionally(angels and demons if you will). It's an idea.   But the point is, we can never know. It's kinda what the matrix was getting at, but I don't think that we exist outside the computer. God could be the programmer. I don't know, and Cahlen doesn't either. But the thing is Cahlen will talk about it, and I just keep it on the inside and ponder it while driving places.   Dejah, I do want to congratulate you on speaking your mind:) I hope you know Cahlen and I laugh at half the shit he says on here. In case you were wondering, Cahlen and I are still on speaking terms.

      I've never seen the world more beautiful  than when it was covered in snow,  glowing like the heavens  beneath the shining moon.  When the snow comes down it makes no sound but the sound  of an angel's sighing.  Can you say this isn't real?  It's not a dream that I'm seeing here.  It would be a dream if I could live  inside that moment,  and run along side the shining unicorn.  But instead I watch as the sun  melts her color into green.  -thoris

      Cahlen, can I say that you amaze me? What you said wasn't a "long psychotic rant." At least, I understood what you were trying to say. Maybe that's because we're related....   Tim on the other hand is so concerned with "bullshit" that he can't see past the end of his nose. All I can say to you right now buddy is... GET A LIFE! You're the one who's full of shit. Just because you're pissed that your life isn't the way that you once thought it should be.

      I know I contradicted myself , but I meant something different.  You had said that we will make our own problems in the sense that we consiously go out and find them, like drugs.  But now I don't really think you were saying that, but I just wanted to make the point that it's an unconcious thing.  Which is what you meant.  So I was being redundant.  Hey give me a break.  It was 4:30 in the freakin morning.  Dej, when you mentioned that moment at Friday Harbor that is what I think it is all about.  I had a similar moment last winter.  Everyone was asleep in the house and I went outside and the moon was out and it lit up the snow.  It was quiet and untouched and I thought I wish I was apart of that.  I would want nothing else just to be a part of it.  I thought, if there is a God, THIS is God.  And if this is God then everything is God.   It was just in this one moment that I was able to see that.  But that doesn't means that's the way all the time.  i just don't realize because I'm caught up in everything else which distracts me.  It's like we're in a dream all the time and when we look back we feel like we've missed something, and I think we have.  There is beauty in everything and we take it all for granted.  And that's just the way our brain works.  It gathers information and catalogues it away for quick reference to quicken the analyzing process.  For example, a tree.  You see a tree and you think tree.  Really not a whole lot else unless you need more info.  Yet everything we see is infinitly complicated and we miss it.  That rock and that harbor will be there when your off running around, it'll be there when you are dead.  It's beauty will remain no matter what happens in your life.  Whether you lead a "good" or "bad" life.  Do you think it really matters?  That beauty is always there in everything, and the only thing I want out of life is to be apart of that.  I want to wake up from this dream live in that moment all the time.  I believe that its possible.  Do you know what sin really means?  It means to miss the point, that's what it originally meant.  When Jesus says he's son of God, I think he means we all are.  I don;t think he was any different than us other than he saw the world the way it is.    Tim, I think that in society there is a point worrying.  It gets things done and it's a trait that just got us this high up in evolution.  If you have one person who sits back and gets only the necessities accomplished and someone who goes for the gusto all the time well he's gonna be the one who's gonna pass on his genes.  We find a point to something and are motivated to get there.  But I think that's just a tool and we can't really use it to answer the meaning of life.  Why does there need to be a meaning?  And what if it is someone's dream?  We can't and won't know any better, and even if we did what could we do about it?  Would it really changed how you live your life?    Dude, you forgot Blood the Last Vampire on the best movies of all time list...

      Bullshit, the thing is we never know shit, we don't know if we really exist so contemplating death doesn't even make sense. This is the thing I love, you can't know anything for certain. For all we know, we could be in someone's(God's) dream. He/She wakes up some day, our existence is totally annihilated, the point is you don't know. You can't know whether or not you're doing anything, a butterfly in brazil triggers a rainstorm in Norway, it's all bullshit. Rock's shit, death is the end? Nihlist? We believe in nothing. Cahlen, you're so full of shit, I can't even look at you.  This'll be a point where we have to just respect each other's opinion and not force our beliefs on one another:)  As far as making your own problems, you said yourself you do, in the sentence after you said you didn't. Worrying about what other people think is bullshit, yet, if you worry about that, you are creating that problem. It has nothing to do with the outside world. It's us, fucking up our own lives.  ARGH!

      Everyone should read Peter Beagle's "The Last Unicorn."   Everyone. Do you hear me? It is the greatest fairy tale ever written.... yes, even more than LoR.   LoR was long. And dark... they were walking and they were tired, afraid, thirsty, depressed. Did I say that it was dark? Oh, and they were thirsty too, and tired of eating Lembas. but it never ran out so they had to keep eating it. That sucks. They could have started eating the grass. Grass is could for you. Just like sourcraut. Is that how you spell it? Well... ITS GOOD FOR YOU! Don't ever let your mom feed it to you for breakfast.   It's gold today shiver me timbers throw out the red garnett and wash your hands of everything you ever believed in  -thoris

      Cahlen, what are you doing up so early? Or should I say.... late?   I agree with you on the whole rock falling off a cliff thing. Sometimes I wonder what the point of everything is and if going to college and getting good grades really will matter in the long run. Well, I don't know whether that kind of stuff is important or not. But I do know that despite all the dumb things we do to make ourselves feel like we're doing something special- getting a job, going to school, etc- there are moments in between that make it all worth it. Yesterday I was sitting on a rock on the shore at Friday harbor labs watching the boats go in and out... watching the waves and the sunlight as it glittered and sparkled across the tremulous blue. There was the wind, the sun, the rock, and myself. In that moment, the only thing that mattered was that I was there. And all the work that I've done to get to that spot made it all worth it.

      Brown cow ice Cream... never had any of that stuff.  Probably pretty good.  It's those weird named things that always taste good.    I don't think you can really say that someone "makes" their own problems.  I think that whatever situation you are in your mind tries to create an equalibriem.  So if you are very well off then things that I would never cross the mind of someone less well-off as being a problem become more prominent.  An example:  Someone simply disagreeing with anything I said would really ruin my day.  I would blow it up into something huge.  While people who might be going through a bankruptcy wouldn't really worry about that kind of thing.  they've got other problems.  It's almost like their "worry quota" was filled.  So I think my point is if one minute you worry about something then something bigger comes up you forget about the previous.  You don't even give a second thought to it anymore.  And when you're not worrying about these things they still work themselves out without a second thought on your part.  There can always be something bigger to worry about so why worry about anything if it can be deemed inconsequential by something else.  Anyway, though worrying is pointless i think the mind needs something negative to meditate on.  Even in the best situation it's gonna find something.    And now for something completely different:  I really hate writing about serious stuff.  We take ourselves too seriously.  If you take a step back and watch we're really pretty hilarious.  An observation a co-worker made, "We're just a bunch of monkeys wearing clothes."  He was on shrooms at the time...  We just run around thinking we're accomplishing something.  Is there really anything we can accomplish?  It's a road going nowhere.  We think, oh it's coming.  If I just work a little harder.  Get through grade school.  It's coming!  What do i do now?  Well High School.  Ok, and now?  College.  Got it, now what?  Get a job.  Sweet.  What next?  Get married, have a family.  One day you're gonna realize "Wow, I'm there..." and you're gonna feel the same way you always have.  I think it's quite obvious there isn't a point to anything we do.  So we try to make a point and maybe it'll get us somewhere.  Really it gets us nowhere, there's nowhere to go.  Religion is the funniest thing when you think about it.  It's just us trying convince ourselves there's a purpose to us being here.  Why does there need to be a purpose?  We think we're different than everything else in the world.  So we're farther up the evolutionary ladder, so what?  Face it, you're gonna die why is that so scary?  I was listening to an Alan Watts lecture a few days ago and he said something that I think really sums it up.  He said it's like the moment we were born we were pushed off a cliff.  So you're falling and it's obvious you're not gonna make it.  There's a rock falling right next to you and you cling to it for dear life.  Well the rocks not gonna do you any good, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.    So maybe that wasn't something completely different, here ya go:  I'm a lumberjack and I'm ok...

      Had some Brown Cow Ice cream tonight, from the Tillamook Cheese Factory.... mmmmmMMMMmmmmm, that's stuff's tasty:)  Also, I think I'd sell some of the cheese for to make some money, but then I'd eat alot of it too, Cahlen.  I think you have a point, problems are usually replaced by other problems, like if someone has a perfect life, they make their own problems("drugs, sex, & rock&Roll)  I dunno, too much deep thought:) I gotta go to bed... Catch you on the flip side

      Enjoy the silence?  I got money to burn, I want to burn it on you, we got one short life, I want to spend it with you... ("Richard Ashcroft")  In the immortal words of Bob or Doug McKenzie("I can't remember which is which, but it's the one played by Dave Thomas")... "I'm taking you to the looney bin, then I'm going to the brewery, Eh?"  All in all, I think this life we live, isn't really predestined... Anyway, I found this poem today over at  urlLink Hangingon.org . and I thought it was really cool, so I thought I'd share it:  Sex Without Love by Sharon Olds   How do they do it, the ones who make love without love? Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away. How do they come to the  come to the come to the God come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin? These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not  accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God. They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health -- just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time.   Cahlen, that one's for you big guy, I hope you're having fun at work:)

      So yeah, sup doggs... I finally got the LP's.  Freakin A.  Yeah Dej, whenever you come home you can head over here and listen to them before I wear them out.  Anime is cool.  That vampire one was especially cool.  Those blood-sucking-demon-red-eye-people-who-can-fly-only-after-a-brief-transformation-which-looks-really-painful-only-to-get-chopped-by-a-scary/cool-vampire-girl are awesome.  I wish I had seen the whole thing.  Anime women are the best.  Anyway...  So here is my deep thought of the day:  If you could own a cheese factory would you keep it all for yourself?  Hmmm...    And now the real deep thought of the day:  Seems to me that no matter what there are times when we are happy and times when we aren't.  No matter what is going on outside my head all emotions really seem to balance themselves out meaning I think I get a pretty good balance of "good" and "bad".  So if I was rich and had everything I wanted I don't think it'd be all that different.  When people are sad all the time we call it depression, an unhealthy state.  Would it be true to say that constant happiness is also an unhealthy state?  Besides, would we really know we were happy if we were never sad?  Ok, enough with the seriousness.  WHOO HOO YIPPEE AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH HAHAHA WHOO WHOO WHOO YE HA HA!!!!!!!!!!

That'll be the problem with my weight, all this free pop:) After winning 2 games of racquetball last night, I'm feeling great.  Once, there was a guy with a bucket on his head, He'd walk around and walk into everything, and then one day he got a car and drove around with a bucket on his head.

      Wow. Four in a row. The boss is on a role.   Cahlen was Captain once upon a time. And Zorf too. He was a great Zorf. I was once his Crewmemeber. But most of all, I was Zot. The wicked, the lovely, the master of sneaky-ness. It was fun to be vaporized, but only by Zorf, and never by myself. Could never vaporize myself. So I revaporized the Captain. Because I didn't want to vaporize myself. And I hate big butterflies with fangs because I'm too short to reach the button.   This all makes sense in some other life....   At least one person understands.

      Concerning the 8/25 entry "I think Cahlen should have said Fuck when he said Frick in the last rant."  WHY!!!!??? Just because you feel comfortable saying it and think everyone else should just say it too instead of saying things like  "Frick and Frock." Maybe that's what Cahlen really meant. Frick. Frock. Not Fuck.

      Hey Cahlen! That's a pretty cool dream you had there. Too bad you had to wake up. Guess I'll have to come over to your place and listen to your turntable Gordon Lightfoot LP's.   What is it about Gordy? He's the man. My roommate doesn't like him. I can forgive her for that.  Maybe.   So once I had a dream that I was this dragon. The king and his daughter were riding out from his castle into the snowy forest, but he didn't know that he was in danger.  I knew, but I was trapped in the dungeon with the king's son. We had been captured and chained to the walls. The king and the princess were captured by the evil men, and the princess was dropped into the lake with a ball and chain. Somehow, I broke my chains, and crashed through the glass wall of the dungeon that overlooked the lake. I dove in after the princess.... I can't remember if I ever came out.

      I just realized that it sounds like I'm complaining a lot on here. Which really isn't my point. Weird, well, anyway, I had some free time today so I bought some movies and a couple of records. I'm soooooooooooo excited. I got some Anime and Forest Gump.  So, I've been having Anime cravings recently. Some people don't understand Anime I guess, but somehow it just makes sense to me. I LOVE Anime. Also, I think I have one of the best jobs in the world. Play video games then tell the dev's how to make it more fun:)   Well, lunch is almost over, I hope you are having a great day:)

      And another thing, it seems no matter who's week it is to take out the garbage, no matter how many times I remind them, it's always up to me. Not that I expect anything much, I just wish it wasn't always my turn:) It's especially funny cause the guy who's turn it was to do dishes this week, waited until last night to start them up. (*The thing you have to realize for our house is like 2 people eat 3 meals there a day. Thus causing about 10 dirty dishes a day, minimum.which makes doind dishes a daily need.*) I just laugh cause of how no one talked to him about it:) Also, I don't eat food prepared at home, so I never have any dishes so it wasn't a big deal for me, besides it looking like shit.  anyway, hope everyone is well, and I'll check you later...

      So, one thing some of my friends don't understand is how I can read like on vacation or something.   Like take for instance when I was in Greece by myself for about a week. Basically, I read the whole week long, got through almost all the way through "Lord of the Rings". But I think it's weird that I read a lot and don't have a HUGE sex drive. Although, I am 23 and I guess I have passed my sexual peak, biologically speaking. Don't get me wrong, I want to have sex. I want someone to return the ball.  Love: physical or mental? This is the problem, usually people who are physically attractive aren't the brightest. Although, one of the things I love about being a guy, is we usually get better with age. Not that I don't think girls get worse, it's just that women usually find older men attractive. It's weird, I think I'd always want to be mentally attracted to a person. Although, the physical attraction, usually overpowers any mental attraction (at least as far as I can tell).   Isn't it weird how we all find the same people attractive? It's the whole, diamond in the rough thing. Finding the one that others have been looking over, cause they don't find them so attractive as say, ricky Martin or Elizabeth Shue. Finding the diamond, that's what it's about

      So, we just got finished watching one of the greatest films ever made... "Empire Records"  It's one of my favorite movies since I first watched it back in like 95. Anyway, I highly suggest seeing it, if you haven't. It was Cahlen's first time, kinda. He'd seen the end b4.  I so want money to spend, but I don't have any cause of bills and the shitty economy:( C'est la vie...  You ever notice how we are never quiet anymore? Like, I can't remember the time I went outside and looked at the night sky. Also, I'm used to way more personal time, and I never get it (*one of the funny things living with 4 other guys*). But besides that, it's weird with the whole, personal time vs. lonely time, cause when you get personal time one can sometimes feel lonely. But other times, you're like, I just want to be alone. 1 of the things I've learned to do, is always have stuff for personal stuff time. Like I now have about 5 books that I have lined up to read. Now, I just need the vacation time to read them all.

      So it turns out I've been combing my hair backwards for as long as I can remember.  See the dealio is this, I was combing my hair in the mirror, and in the mirror everything is backwards. Thus when I was combing my hair to look normal, I was actually combing it backwards. This is really hard to deal with, considering I've been doing it since I was like 8 or whatever age it is one starts combing one's hair.  hmm... Cahlen was dropped on his head.... that explains a lot of things:)  well, now it's time to play video games, I mean work:)

      So a little more dissemination of information...  here's the dealio, I think. First you're born and everyone loves you, then you learn that everyone doesn't love you later. Then you deal with that, and how you deal with that is how you turn out. But really that's just bullshit too, cause you react to everything in a certain way, and that's just one thing you're reacting to.   If I had to choose between knowing everything and knowing nothing, I would most undoubtedly choose to know nothing.   A common dillemma has hit our house, we're out of TP. It's not a big problem, but it means I have to go to Costco, and I can't go to costco until people pay me for bills, which is basically like pulling teeth. Not you Cahlen, the other people in the house:) (and by other people I don't mean kevin or cliff)  We watched "Cowboy Bebop" Disk 1 tonight, which was way fun. I highly recommend the entire 6 disk series of which I only have disk 1 and 5.  Sorry for the depressing poem earlier, I just had to get it out.  The truth of the matter is this, I really do know nothing, but at least I have a good idea:)  I love that I have no idea whether or not anyone is actually reading this thing. This way I can write whatever is on my mind and it'd just there in black and white for all to see, if they wanna look.  g'night

      I was dropped on my head?   hehe......cool......  Hey Dej, I bought a turntable.  I also bought 13 Gordon Lightfoot LP's (records).  Sweet eh?  So I had a dream.  It was pretty cool.  I got this box in the mail.  It was a long box.  I thought, "Hmmm, maybe there is some Gordon Lightfoot LP's in here."  I thought that mostly because I had bought some.  I opened the box and there were some Gordon Lightfoot LP's.  I was happy.  So I played them with the syringe needle.  Hey, I'm sure it works as good as any other needle plus come one, it's a freakin dream.  Yeah and they played music.  I woke up and I was happy.  Then when I actually came to, you know it takes about 30 min before you say hey that wasn't real, then I wan't happy anymore.  I wrote an email.  I was mad.  They said they sent them though.  Then I thought, I had them when I was sleeping, and now I have to wait.  Frick.  I'm going back to bed.

Better watch a cartoon Who let a fluffy? Whoa, what died in here? The end

      And now a poem by yours truly...  At night, can you hear me cry? Can you see the pain?  God weeps, for the hell we make and the hell we live, This silence overwhelms me, coming from my soul, A cry, dear God, can you hear me?  The servant that cannot live without you, I feel so alone, will you not comfort me, like you did so long ago?  GOD!!! I'm here, what is it that you want from me? All the bullshit I see, this can't be what was intended....  can you hear my silent screams, though they never come?

      Is Cahlen really a crack baby? I don't know, I think he's just creative. One time we sang this song about his headgear:  I have to wear my stupid headgear    he has to wear his stupid headgear I have to wear my stupid headgear    he has to wear his stupid headgear     all day headgear   Maybe it's because I grew up with him, but I appreciate his weird sense of humor.   Oh yeah, and he was dropped on his head when he was a baby. He fell off the changing table when mom wasn't looking.

      So, my love life...  I can recall at one point in my life, when I liked a girl and she liked me back, maybe 2, but 1 is confirmed. Now the problem is this, as soon as I think a girl could possibly like me, I just freak out. I'll be like, "no, you can't like me", which is just stupid.  I really have no idea why I force people that might be attracted to me away. It's really the stupedest thing I do. The other thing I do is tell the truth, pretty much unconditionally, which causes people to get hurt. It's just all the Bullshit, it's a drag, you know?  Then these girls that I could like, are like totally scared that I might like them. Which I don't understand. It's not like I'm really a scary guy. At least I don't think I am. Maybe, it's that I don't stand out, but then I do have blue hair, maybe it's cause I'm more plump than the next guy.  Really though, are we supposed to change for the ladies? or are we just supposed to find one that we're compatible with?  I know this for certain, "All women are crazy", and  "All men are crazy", it's just finding the craziness that fits together is key. It's finding the someone with the same kind or balancing craziness that's the trouble.

      So, I went to  urlLink Michael's Toyota  this morning to see if I could maybe get a corolla with less payments. That way I'd still have a nice car but my payments would be less a month.  Actually, I was trying to decide between a Corolla and an Echo,  but after test driving them, I decided on the Corolla. Anyway, so we sit down to go over financials and the dude is like, I'l be right back. And I'm like, cool, cause the corollas are having a special 4.9% APR for a 60 mo loan. So, I'm like "Kick Ass"....  About 20 minutes later (mind you all I had to keep me entertained is my cell phone with snake on it.), he comes back with his manager. The manager goes into this little speel... "Today, we can get you in a 2001 Tundra, and at 60 mos, you'll pay 505/month, plus we need a down payment of $1200"... or translated... (*We don't think you're serious so please leave our store*) Assholes.   Anyway, I hope everyone is enjoying my postings, I know I am:)

      So, maybe a little disclaimer...  These rants and raves by the peoples that I know...  They are opinions and are not to be taken as the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth...  So perhaps a little "Beliefs" section by your's truly...  So here are my beliefs, feel free to write, I don't bite (*too hard*)  I believe myself to be christian, probably in the most liberal sense of the word. I do miss ignorance, but am happily living my hetero single lifestyle. I love in your face statements that'll probably piss people off, cause no matter how true they might be, our society has told us another way. (*example: evolution, we see it everywhere, yet most christians still believe in creation.*) I do dislike some christian pastors, I feel sorry for them really, cause if you want a big congregation you have to speak to the lowest denominator. The problem with this is you don't have a chance to learn much from each sermon and then they ask you for money.  I guess it's just this, I like my friends. I don't think people should judge me as a sinner for saying fuck, or shit, or asshole, or flipping someone off. None of us is better than the other. Isn't that what Christ told us? But then, I feel like I'm a reverse person where I judge people for not saying fuck or shit or asshole. When really, I'm fine if people don't want to say those words, but I don't think they should take offense to shit coming out of my mouth.  I think I'm very open minded. (*too open minded?*) Anyway, I love meeting new people, even if my Schizotypal self isn't:) Well, I gotta go...

      I like El Camino's.  Cliff is gone to Spain.  Dejah is my sister.  I want to go to Wyoming.  Tim has blue hair.  I think I'm starting to like it.  I used to be the Captain.  I used to be Zorf.  But I can't do it anymore.  My voice changed.  My youth is lost.  I have a 929.  Where are my Gordon Lightfoot LP's?  Frick!  I payed for them last week.  Argh!  What's the use of having a turntable.  I have tickets.  American Pie 2 is funny.  I'm going back to SPU.  I think.  Jebe is far away.  I wear pajamas to work.  Jeff is a cop.  I used to play the oboe.  Why do I have to look at my life as a timeline I need to plan to fill?  Why should I care what happens tomorrow?  Frick.  Frock.  Uncle Toad said you better straighten up right.  It'd be nice to have money.  I think I'm gonna become a nomad.  Don't beat me down.

      I guess if there's anything that best discribes oneself, it would be your friends...  This is what one friend wrote about me:  Tim - a guy with too much free time who writes descriptions of his friends that are so honest he might lose some of them after his memoirs get published.  he gets pissed when you spell it "dood."  he likes to talk, and his form of humor is to repeat the same jokes over and over.  he's anal about being on time, spelling, and about maintaining friendships. he's always up for drinking and having a good time.

      So, how about a little about your's truly?  I'm a 23 yr old virgin that plays video games for money and does web design on the side.... (now that I got your attention, maybe you would like an explanation)  So, I graduated from Seattle Pacific University last year and went to Europe for 6 weeks. (A Tim's adventure which will someday be packaged into a little (*big*) website for all to see and love) Oh wait, the whole virgin thing... Umm... basically I haven't gotten laid yet, that's how I'm a virgin. Don't get me wrong, I'd like to have sex, just haven't gotten around to it yet. For right now I'm content with  urlLink Self love    Back to the whole game worker thing.... Wehn I get back from Europe I start working for a dot com, and get hired on as the highest paid webdeveloper there. (Granted I don't think I'm the most highly skilled web dev, but I asked for a lot since it was the internet BOOM and all. Well, come January, said Dot com runs out of money. (*This is after I buy a 2001 Toyota Celica in November*) They decide to drop to 50% employment. Well, I was one of the "lucky" few they asked to stay on at a major salary cut. I stayed with them until the money dried up for real in March. At which point I went on uneployment.  Then the tricky stuff starts happening. Since I'm bored most of the time, I start writing my memoirs, apply for undergraduate work at SPU for a degree in Christian Theology, and basically sit and play video games all day. I contact about 7 "recruiters" or placement agencies, but nothing comes through.  Well, I get accepted to SPU and go in to meet with my financial Aid officer, who is great, very helpful. While I'm there, I check the job boards. I see a web dev job opening for a small company (7 peeps). So I figure what the heck, unemployment is almost run out so I send them my resume. (This is on Monday) Wednesday night they call me for an interview on thursday. Thursday i go in and get the job. I start friday.  Now, my buddy, who is a game tester calls me up and says, "Dude, they're looking for peeps to hire and send me your resume". So I do. I get called from Volt during the week after my interview with said small company. "So, MS is hiring a game tester to play new games and tell you what you think of em." says Volt person and can I come interview. I say "Hell yeah" then go to job interview. Well, I got the job, which is fine considering, said small company only wanted to hire a part time person.  This is my hectic life in the year 2001. I am now not going to SPU, but am working 2 jobs at aroun 60 - 70 hours a week. Well, back to work...

      Second Rant. When I'm on a roll what can I say?  So women. Can't live with them, can't understand them, but I'm still in love with them. One thing you ladies NEED to know. Men masturbate, we do, it's not like you're going to find one that doesn't. I think it's bullshit that we can't come to grips with this as a society.   The perfect guy is bullshit. I think that women are looking for this guy they think they want, but they never really want it when they get it. Women want a strong man that isn't a bully and that is handsome and never screws up. However, by definition, Man is going to screw up, you women just need to learn how to live with it. We're going to piss you off occasionally.   I'm still trying to figure out what women want. I tried to be the sensitive guy, but then they were just like "I like you but not like that", of course I was going after christian girls and my buddy says that they're just cockteases. Not my words, his. Unfortunately, I don't get out much, and when I do I don't drink enough to lose all inhibitions. But really, what's a guy to do?  Well, I should go to bed, I can't think clearly anyway, check you latah-

      So, my first rant. Selling God.  What is it with Christians trying to sell God? It's not like you can package him in a little box and candy coat him and say here's God. Using God to get money really pisses me off. Take for instances when I was in church on sunday. This dude was asking for money so that he could finance these people to go to his seminar. It wouldn't have been so bad but they asked for people to give 5000 dollars and basically said if you didn't that you wouldn't get as big a reward in Heaven.   This is what church has become. Basically, show off and look better than the next guy. Well, I call Bullshit. I mean you're going to tell me I'm going to Hell if I say Fucking Shit motherfuckers? I don't think so. Maybe if I said, "You motherfucking cocksucking sons of Bitches"? Well, I don't remember God saying well, if this dude is cussing he's going to HELL.  Here was the dilemma I dealt with. I was "set apart" as the church people say. But then I had trouble relating to non christians and that's not what Jesus was about y'all. Anyway, I just figured that I should immerse myself and try to save them on the inside:)  Anyway, I'm just ranting. I hope I may have enlarged someone's brain just a little bit or at least pissed someone off.  Check you guys later.

So, I was like WTF.   Anyway, I hope you are all having a good one. I'd like to Recommend the book "Youth in Revolt" which is fuckin awesome. It's basically a look at the thoughts of a 14 yr old male. I found it true to what I was feeling at that age, and if you're a lady I think it's a great case study at the male psyche. Well, check you latah

Take this morning for instance, I wake up at 7:20 to my alarm and hit snooze("I don't actually have to be on the road until about 8:15 or so and it only takes me about 15 minutes to get ready in the morning"), well at 7:26 when I'm about to fall asleep again, right at the point of losing consciousness, it goes off again.... I mean how annoying is that? So I hit the snooze again and history repeats itself at 7:32... I hate this snooze button soooooo bad.... Maybe it's time I took my regular alarm clock back from Cahlen

      So, now a lesson on cussing...  If you don't make a big deal out of it, it won't be a big deal, although sometimes I think maybe I should curve my cussing skills...  But then sometimes people really piss me off, and my feeling can't really be better expressed than, "You shit ass motherfucker!"  Hmm... are there any words that maybe I could make cuss words? Like "hankering"... hmm...  Speaking of hankering... I've had a hankering for Thai food a lot recently... and it's been like 15 days since my last thai fix, and I want to have like 3 different thai dishes which means I have to go 3 times to the thai restaurant... I tell you my palate is insatiable:)  People don't say "hankering" any more, how weird is that? also, why do people no longer say, "2 legit, 2 legit 2 quit"?  mmm... Hammer:)

      So I almost killed myself today. I was messing around with a plug for the dryer (after moving it), and so I plugged it in (the chord wasn't connected to anything). Needless to say, there was one big zap sound, and some burned piece of metal fell on my hand. But I'm still alive, and a little wiser for the wear.   Anyways... back to watching tough enough.

      subconsciously, I think the thing I fear the most is that a girl might actually fall for me... It seems as soon as I think someone might like me, I do everything I can think of to get them to not like me like that(aka love?)  How fucked up is that? I mean when you combine it with the fact that I long for intimate contact... It just doesn't make sense. My subconscious only foils me...

      So I was reading this book at work.  It's a pretty good one about some dude who gets T.E.'s.  Tim recommended it to me.  I just thought it would be interesting to note that this guy has a split personality and the bad-ass is called Francois.  Francois is a French name, as is another name we're all familiar with: Pierre.  Did I mention Tim recommended this book to me?

Artists consistently impress me, stupid people consistently stupify me, and bloggers always interest me... (well usually anyway)  This one time I read this one blog(I don't really remember it) but then I was like "who are these people and what are they talking about" and then I was like I dunno and now I've forgotten about em except how I wrote this blog about them.

      So what books are for Tim, DVD's are for me. I was at Border's with Tim on Monday, and spent far too little time browsing the DVD section, but I did find a lot of stuff I wanted. Then I had to go to Freddies tonight, and found even more. And then I checked the net to find out that Moulin Rouge comes out Dec 18, in a super special edition, and it's in a box set with Strictly Ballroom and a new special edition of Romeo + Juliet. Woo hoo! Too many dvd's, too little time (and money). Why I didn't just major in film studies and become a critic instead of getting a stupid computer science degree, I'll never know :)  Lessee... it's almost moving day, just a bit more cleaning to do and I'm out of this crazy temporary living situation. Woo hoo! A new apartment (still in Lovely, Downtown Monroe *roll eyes*). At least it'll be our place instead of someone else's house.   On a sports note... how about them San Diego Chargers! Woo hoo! 2-0! (for those who don't know, but are actually wondering why the SD Chargers, I've been a fan for 20+ years, ever since I saw them beat the Seahawks by like 40 points or something way back when).    And for those who don't regularly contribute to this site (or are not listed in the links) who actually read this stuff and write to us, what the hell is wrong with you? :) I mean, um, thanks.

      To go along with that post about books earlier... Monday, I went into a "Borders" and was like, "I want this book and this book and this book, and dammit they're out of this book that I also want to get". Then yesterday 2 books I order from Amazon finally arrived to be added to the pile of books to read. And then today, I got my advertisement from  urlLink SFBC  and was like, I want this book and that book and....  You get the idea, I need to stop reading so damn much:)

      Tim you remind me of a twilight zone episode where there's this dude who really likes to read.  He is sad, though, because he is so busy he never can.  But one time when he was in the bank vault a bunch of bombs go off and kill EVERYONE.  He comes out and is like, "What they hey?"  Then he walks around and sees all these books laying on the street and he realizes this is where the library was.  And then he's like, "Cool dude!", because now he can read forever and no one can bother him.  You know what happens next?  The stupid idiot breaks his glasses and he's like, "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  Sad story eh?  So be careful Tim...

I did not think that was appropriate. But maybe tomorrow I will forget everything about it, except how I have this blog now to remind me. Also, my teeth are numb, this is my best:) And I think my lips are numb too, but I can't tell to sure. Well, I guess I need sleep, after all I am lopsided as I post this post.

      Hey everybuddy  So work has been weird. I guess we're not working OT again for a while, which I just don't get. First they say we're working all the OT we can, then they say no more OT. I just wish they'd make up their minds. It's tough to get into a normal routine when your schedule seems to change everyday. On a bit of a side note, my lead can be kinda weird sometimes. Like Saturday morning, I forogot to shut my web browser after I checked my hotmail account before work, and he's all giving me some inquisition about having a web browser open while I am working. Then yesterday my co-worker had a web site open while working and nary a word said by the lead. Of course, this is the co-worker who the lead always goes to lunch with and carpools with. Draw your own conclusions. It's just wierd to have a lead who acts all cool one day towards you, and then acts all superboss the next. Argh. At least I'm enjoying the game I'm working on a bit more.   Anyhowie.... this weekend is moving time, so the temporary living situation is almost over! Finally!   Time for sleep.

      The other night when we got Top Foods chinese food. The asked for my "secret code" at the ATM pay thing. I liked how they said "secret code" cause it made me feel like I had a secret that no one else could know. I felt like a spy:) Anyway, I think they should all say "secret code" instead of PIN number, that way I can feel like a spy all the time:)

I think we need more mystery in the world. It was like i could see the edges of the world, but I could never get there.  goodnight

      All this talk about a dog... wow. Who knew you guys could actually speak to the animals. Maybe you should become vetranarians or something.   I actually didn't have to work OT today, so I'm just chillin waitin for Tim to go hang out for a bit. Woo hoo! Unfortunately, I'll be doing tons of OT for the next couple of weeks, so my one whole break will probably be moving on Saturday. Fun times.   What the hell is SFS? ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, wait, I get it. nevermind.   Noich noich noich.   Snoochie Boochies. Who the hell says Snoochie boochies? That's like baby talk or something.

      BTW - I spoke with Pierre as well...  I asked him what he thought about Timmay and him saying that he was French and had all sorts of women after him and all, and you know what he refused to talk and in fact looked a little confused.  I think he was interested in the bacon I had in my hands.  It's beyond me how Tim got all that stuff out of him when all I could get was a "ruff".  Pierre is so cute...

      So, I finally got to register for classes. It's been close before, but I don't think I've ever done the day of classes. After I paid the outrageous amount, including the extra account interest charge, I came back to my apartment and tried to register, only the hold wasn't removed. How annoying. I was about to condemn SFS to some extra dimensional void, but then I called the girl who was helping me and she fixed it.   Raise your hand if you like SFS..... Anybody? Anybody?

      BTW- I spoke with Pierre...  1st he's mad at Cahlen for inferring he is a dog. But when I asked him about his name vs. upbringing he explained it as so...  "My dad is a french international banker. He fell in love with my mother on a vacation to Sicily.  They had a passionate love affair and I am named after him. They had to remain apart mostly until I was 5 when he brought us to live with him in the US."  So that's Pierre's story...  I guess that's good cause I hear french people are stuck up, but in my opinion it was the Spaniards that were the one's that were stuck up....

      So as you may or may not have heard/understood from kevin, I went to bed at 9 something last night. Needless to say, I needed that. I found that I was starting to do things that I usually only do when I am drunk....  Anyway, to answer kevin's bitching question("Don't worry Kev, I didn't take it personally"). I think we tend to complain when... a) we're bored b) we don't know what we're doing c)have really stupid management d) have a job. If anyone of these things is true, you're most likely not doing the thing you'd be choosing to do for 8 hours on a given day. Like take sleep for instance, I know an individual (perhaps 2) that loves to sleep almost all weekend:) Now preferably this individual would stay up all night surfing the internet and working on projects, unfortunately said individual has a job and therefore can't stay up till all hours of the night(although he does)  In other words, Bitching comes with a job:)  In other news, Travis is a bitch:)

      I think Tim's been watching Fried Green Tomatoes or something again, with all this wrapped in Saran Wrap stuff. Anyways...  so I haven't written anything in here for a while, but I don't really have anything to write. I must lead one of the most boring lives of anyone on the planet or something. It's scary sometimes. What can I say though, when you only have 1 day off a week, and you just spend your day resting. Maybe I should just move to Japan for a while or something :)  Oh, and it's nice to see you posting again, Dejah.

(5 days and counting down) I'm just tired all the time. I did get my CCR the other day. They're on Vinyl and I'm loving them, when I get to Cahlen's room to listen to them. Maybe I should sleep more, I think I'm falling asleep right now.  hmm... SPU starts tomorrow which means I have had some friends move back to seattle:) It's good to see friends.  Speaking of which, Steve's back in town which is always a whirlwind of drinking and partying:) Also, there's another guy I know coming up from portland this week...  well, good night, and Trav, I'm serious dude, don't you be fallin for my girl...

It conjurs images of weekends with dad(the smell of his house, the kitchen on saturday morning when the light would come in through the window, driving with my step mom)  It reminds me of little tim., aka pierre. Happily living oblivious to all that goes on in the adult world. No bills, no worris, just normal schizotypal Tim:)  PS- Cahlen is avoidant, which is probably why he didn't tell you himself... (True story, he told me that he took the test and is avoidant, when asked to post it, he said, "no way")  Also, it's interesting that he has a job as a security guard where he has little interaction with people. (it's a night time gig, in case you didn't know)

      dammit, I can't even spell saran right... Argh, and after you all know how anal I am about spelling. Sometimes, I just could kick myself, but then I realize I'm not that flexible:) (ok I am that flexible)  Also, Pierre thinks he would like to kick someones ass, and in the middle of the ass kicking say, "And call me pierre dammit"....

      So, I was just sitting here reading kevin's post thingy, and I tried to hit F5 for refresh, but I accidentally hit one of the many keys above my keyboard(web/home) and all of a sudden I was at my home page. I was like umm, what happened?!?!?. Well, it turns out all those keys actually work. I had no idea. It's like I just got a new toy:) No money down, no payments ever:)

      So now Kevin and Craig are in my room playing GT3... Craig had not seen it and did not know what the fuss was about.  Damn, damn, I really want to watch the daily show from last night, but no one has it:( Soak Kelley, I didn't think you were really mad at me, I just wanted everyone who reads this to think you were:) (oops, now will you really be mad at me?)  Also, I am working this weekend, so if any girls who read this site that I don't know about were planning on showing up at my house sometime saturday or sunday afternoon dressed only in syran wrap, you'll have to wait until evening or do it next saturday. (is that a run on sentence?) hmm...

      so, my meeting went well tonight, no new work for tim:)  Also, to the amazement of all that know him,  urlLink Kevin  (You know my roommate, who's birthday it is today) has started his own Blog:) It kinda brings a tear to my eye:)  In other news, I still haven't gotten laid:)

      So evidentally Jon Stewart and the daily show were hilarious tonight, but my mom called right at the beginning and wouldn't let me watch it. So now I'll never know and now I think  urlLink Kelley  might be mad at me:(  Also, I was thinking, I am really sexually frustrated almost to a point of actually pursuing sex. Not quite to the point of actually pursuing sex, but it seems that I cannot live in this state of sexual frustration forever. I mean, I want someone to return the ball:)  Another thing I find interesting is that the peeps that read this thing. Like there's people I talk to who've I've mentioned the site to and then they tell me later that they find it interesting:) (or at least that they read it, they don't really say it's interesting)  Also important news tonight. I've registered www.timsadventures.com and www.unwantedhero.com  The timsadventures will be the site for normal tim, and the unwantedhero will be for alter ego tim(or as I like to call him, John)  well, check you later

      Dude.... I'd say let's go do something Saturday, but then I'm probably going to be working that day anyway (just til 5 though).   Work, it can be fun, and suck at the same time. It's great to have a job and all, especially one where I'm just working on testing games, but when it sucks away all your life, it can be kind of annoying. oh well, I'm just glad I have a job.   So I don't have anything else to say, I can't help it, my brain is broken.

      so, I don't think I'm a very good teacher... I was trying to get jebe's supergreg picture to link by telling her about the onclick=location.href thingy, but then it didn't work and she had to call her parents.  So now I feel bad cause I don't know what's wrong with it and I may have had her break it accidentally:(  Oh my goodness: it works now:) I guess she figured it out:) YAY! I love when links work:)  Sorry for cunfusing you jebe!

      So I was reading Jebe's posts right now, and then I clicked refresh and like a book appeared. I couldn't understand most of the words in the "post" but it seemed to be something to do with medical stuffs.   Well, now I'm waiting for cliff to get home so we can play video games or something.  I started reading "The last unicorn" today. The jury is still out on this one. It gets right to the subject right away, which is good, but.... I don't know.  Anyway, I got asked to work saturday today, so I have to decide if I'm gonna do that. (Notice: if you want to do something on saturday, tell me tonight, otherwise I'll probably work) I said I'd find out tonight and get back to my boss tomorrow. It's a fun job that I'm enjoying, I just don't know if I can work 13 days straight.  It's especially difficult when I don't get to bed before midnight....

      So I finally finished my book, "Youth in revolt" and decided to give you a couple of quotes that I enjoyed from the book.  "THURSDAY, December 31, New Year's Eve - Consider, if you will, the morning boner. What a metaphor of hope and renewal! How can anyone give way to despair when one's groin greets each new day with such a gala spectacle of physiological optimism? And what an anotommical prod to philosophical contemplation on the final day of the year" pg. 493 - Youth in Revolt, C.D. Payne   And now I can't remember the other quotes I wanted to share:( Well, Cliff is supposed to come back tonight(cross my fingers)  Check you guys latah

      Argh in my eye!!!!  Today, I reformatted(after spending 7 hours at work) and then realized I failed to back up my messages:( I have it backed up from 2 weeks ago, but I archived almost all the messages from the past 2 weeks and then forgot to save the archive:(  So, now I have no written record of my emails....  Hold on, Thank God for "Deleted items" folder on hotmail. All of my stuff I "moved" to archives is still waiting to be deleted. I copied it back to my archives folder:)  It's 1:15 I need to go to bed:)

      Yes, CAhlen, remember all those girls you talked to during school? Or lack there of....  In other news- Kevin got done talking to Austin who said that his "friend" has another apartment and that he hasn't been staying here for 2 weeks, but that he would introduce him and that he would do the dishes today(sunday).  I haven't heard from cliff or hannah since thursday. :( Hopefully they're on their way home...

      I don't know...  So CAhlen has this issue with talking to girls that I think we should confront for him. An intervention if you will:)   Although, I'm not one to talk. I mean I talk to females fine, and all that, I just can't start a "relationship" with one.  Anyway, it's time to go out to see rockstar, sorry for giving you a bad time CAhlen:)

      Ok, now for life on the lighter side, just for a moment, as I'm getting sick of getting these stupid hints from this dumb crush thing on email (see the archives if you missed the earlier rant). I'm enlisting all of you to help me out, as I don't know who to guess, and I only know of 3-4 females who actually know my email address (2 of whom are related to me, and the other 2 didn't do this crush thing). Here are the hints:  1. the first name is 5 characters long. 2. the last name is 4 or fewer long. 3. the first name begins with a letter between a and e 4. the email username is 8 or more characters long 5. the email account is not with hotmail.com There. Any ideas? You'll get a special bonus if you can id them.

      You gotta love the crazy people who think they need to attack anyone who looks like they might be islamic. I'm speaking mostly of the dumb idiot who attacked a mosque in Seattle yesterday. Why can't stupid white americans realize that just because someone is a muslim it doesn't mean that they're a  terrorist? Just like back in the 40's when just because someone was a japanese-american didn't mean they were all spies for Japan? Hello? Are we all still that stupid?

      So Mary- Yes, I've read LOTR and the Hobbit. (Nice reference. Although, precious was more about the good person you want to be, not a ring so much) I dunno who MzJaxon is, but they are a mary on the internet that is stalking me.  Everyone Else- Isn't it weird how we all put up a front? I mean, we can't walk around being sensitive all the time. Like I really enjoy museums and especially paintings, but if I did what I wanted to, sit and stare at a painting all day, whoever I was with would get bored and leave. And so I move on in a somewhat quickened pace and don't allow myself to want to look at the painting. I think I'm using this as a metaphor, U long for a deep trusting relationship, but you don't really have the time, and you don't know if the other person wants the same thing, so you skirt the issue... You play that you're not that interested then, if it comes up and they don't like you, then you can say, "well, I didn't feel much for you anyway", when in fact, you wanted to badly, but disallowed yourself to feel.  Everyday, I feel as though I could live like the kid in American Beauty, finding just the most mundane things beautiful, and it's cause I can. However, I find living in such a state of awareness, exhausting. The emotional taxing would be so great, and I'd probably cry all the time.  Well, gotta run, keep it real

      So I'm still recovering from this weekend. I haven't stayed up so late on consecutive days for a couple of years, basically, so it's taking me a while to get back to normal. But I'll survive... and it was such a good weekend of hanging out with everyone, and doing a little reminiscing. Maybe we should do this more often.   Anyhowie... 2 more days of work. I really need to find a job soon.

      so, in case you were wondering, I didn't go to said party last night.  I chilled with Big A at the house instead, had to run to the bank too. Sorry Trav, we'll have to meet some other time. Hope your 21 is all that you could ever want:) Especially if all you want is to legally buy alky:) Cause then you got your dream:)  also, I was thinking about something to write on blogger the other day, but then I forget what it was. Maybe I'll remember it.   There was something about masturbation, but I didn't know if it were appropriate to talk about that here;) Actually I just figured no one would want to talk about it.  So, as we move on... The question of the day is, "who is mzJaxon?" if you can tell me the answer, I'll write "her" back. If no one can, she'll just have to keep emailing me with no replies:(

      What a lazy day off. I didn't really do much today. Played some  urlLink Red Faction , messed around on the internet a bit, cleaned up my room a little, and stuff like that. Nothing big, that's for sure. I did get  urlLink Musicmatch Jukebox  installed on my machine, so now I can make mp3's and burn mix cd's. Woo Hoo! I also picked up the new Incubus cd, but haven't had a chance to listen to much of it yet. What I have heard sounds pretty good, but I'm not sure what songs I like on it yet.   I just got done watching High Fidelity. That's a pretty good movie. I would say more, but then I'd have to dissect my thoughts too much, and I'd write a few pages instead of a few sentences.

      also, I don't think you could be addicted, but curiousity did kill the cat, I remember when I was like 20 and I would have cravings for beer, and the funny thing is, I hadn't had a beer since I was like 4. My mom always used to tell me to try the "brussel sprouts" cause I might have grown to like them since last time, and although I'll never "grow to like" brussel sprouts, I think I did grow to like beer. weird moms

      So, I'm contemplating teaching english in Japan, yet again. I don't know if I really want to do it, or am just looking for something completely different to do with my life. At any rate, I do know that one group will be interviewing in Seattle in December, and so I have til mid November to make up my mind.   I get to sleep in tomorrow, as I don't have to work. I'm down to 5 days of employment. I wish there were other projects hiring right now, but everything pretty much shuts down in the winter. That's life in the game industry.   Why does everything have to be on sale when the economy sucks? It's like, hey, everyone's out of work, let's have sales on things they can't afford to get anyways. Like people are going to be able to buy something when it's 10% off as opposed to regular price. Don't stores know that they don't have the money anyways? I guess it's great for those with job security.

      No matter what time I leave my house, it seems like I can't get to work late. I even stopped at 7-11 this morning and still made it here on time. Oh well....  Yesterday went by without a hitch and I even have more stuff to do today. I brought in my music this morning, so I'm listening to a little D right now:)  Also, I got to eat at Pete's Pizza last night which was fun, good company.  and another thing, do you think you could get cravings or be addicted to drugs you've never had? just a contemplation...

      So the Seattle Mariners showed what they are made of in the play offs yet again. I'm kinda bummed, but I also kinda expected this. The torture continues for the lifelong fan.   In other news... I'm still employed for about a week. I am trying to find something to do that is remotely computer/software testing related, but there aren't a whole lot of jobs out there right now.  It's nice to get off work after only 8 hours though. wow. Who knew what the world looked like when there was still a little sunlight out?

      random quotes I've heard in my life: "Either it's hot in here, or I'm going through the pause again" "I like to sit on cracks" "This one time at band camp"  Oh wait that last one was from a movie, not really my life...  Hmm... how to get drunk tim not to post... this will be the trick I think... Personally I think he likes to post, he feels that he'll say what I won't say... weird drunk tim...  In other news, I think we could say we have different selves for different people we're around, but also reoccuring themes running throughout each self. IE, in all my selves I believe in God and respect my elders. But in some selves I'm more respectful of women and strangers than I am as other selves. When I write on blog, I think that's one self, but it's also whichever self I am at the time. Does this make any sense? Does anyone understand me?

      Psycho time. I'm away from bloggs for one day, and come back to this..... Tim, I REALLY recommend you NOT make posts when you're drunk. It's not very flattering to say the least.   And now it's my turn to complain about something. I really hate it when I write a huge long email to one of my family members and they reply, three days later, with an email one sentence long. So much for attempting to facilitate a flourishing correspondence....

Just Sunday hero, and I don't think she wants to talk to me anymore... :( Well, if anyone who reads this site, has an access code, I'd love to have it, so I could join and maybe "publish" some of my written words on it.

      So, I'm in Oregon right now. And Kevin's in NY. Talk about a house divided:) Although I don't think that's what they were talking about...  In other news, everytime I go use the urinal at the Woodinville theater I notice the cake holders have a website on them. And I always mean to mention it to you guys, cause I thought it was really funny. Like, hey, the thing I'm pissing on has a website. WHAT THE FUCK!!!   Anyway, I'm gonna kill off unwelcome hero as pierre's site, but I will hopefully do something useful with it. Do you guys have any suggestions?  Also, do you think you can see your parents as other people see them? or is there a parent filter there... weird...  prolly won't be able to write again till sunday cause I'm at home so I'll talk to you guys latah

      To answer Tim's perception question, yes, I think people can change their perceptions of others or the world. As you have experiences and gain knowledge throughout life, your views/perceptions of things will change. Now, changing how others perceive you can be kind of difficult, especially people who have known you for a while. They'll pretty much always perceive you as the way they've known you for however long.   What/which of your perceptions were you planning on changing?

      Hey kev- I guess, I prolly use movies, video games, and tv shows for my basis of argument because I somewhat believe that they are our modern day story tellers. I mean, Jesus/Mohammed/homer, didn't have the written word, and so they told parables/stories. I think that the forms of media that I use to convey a point have taken the place of story tellers. True, I prolly give em more credit than they are due, but I think one could make some assumptions about civilization based on the top grossing films. I also believe that music is a great persuader, maybe I should start using music to discuss my points:)   All-in-all I'm not trying to argue this with you, as I didn't take offense, just thought you might wonder why I argue the way I do sometimes.   Although, I'm just a rock, or was it an island?

      moving on to perception...  I was just wondering what you guys thought about, whether one could change their perception. I know that people can get some pretty messed up perceptions on life, and I was wondering if one might change it.   I was thinking of changing mine the other day, and was wondering if I should/could. reinvent oneself? change of perception? mpd?   I dunno... what do you guys think?

      So we're all just a little crazy. Or maybe Tim's just had experiences with total psychos :)  Anyhowie... such a fun day of work. Lack of communication/mixed signals or something just left me feeling weird about when I left work today, so hopefully I don't get in any trouble tomorrow. But if I do, it's not like I'm around much longer, as my contract is up in 2 weeks. I hope I can find some employment normalcy soon, so that area of my life would be stable so that pretty much everything else stays stable. Ah, the joys of debt.   And Cliffy, that was an interesting anti-Clinton post you had there. Since you introduced politics into the blog, just remember to vote for me, Big A, for President of the United States in 2008. I can't be any worse than the others available to vote for :)

      I think when Tim says crazy he means, like you said, we think differently and that's cool.  Once upon a time I was a stupid little kid and I fell in love with this girl.  Then I dumped her because she was "weird", but now I realize that's what I loved about her...  I'm a fuckin idiot....

      hahaha, so I had this whole thing written out, then blogger puked on me:P  It's not that I find women are crazy all of the time. In fact most of the time they are perfectly rational. and I don't think this is limited to females. Men can be just as crazy sometimes too. Like in this past week's episode of "enterprise", when the only rational person on the planet after the pollen got stirred up, was a girl. I mean given, she was a vulcan, but the men were just totally crazy.  Like Cahlen said, "you would not believe how little it takes for a persons mind to snap" or something along those lines:)  Well, that's pretty much it. I can't get on MSN today:(

      So, you think women lack the gift of rational reasoning. And men are sooo good at it. Well, all I can say is that men and women percieve things differently, so naturally, they disagree on what is an overreaction and what is not. And I know that some girls are worse at "overreacting" than others, just as some are more emotional and flighty than others, and some are more emotionally balanced. But please don't say that women lack rational reasoning. It's just that sometimes their rational reasoning is overrided by their emotions.... like Captain Kirk.....

      hmm... crazy... how can I think of crazy... I guess my feelings on crazy are lacking of rational reasoning. not to say that one's feelings aren't rationale, sometimes they aren't though. And usually I've found it to be true mostly with girls. but the fact that he asks if it's that time of the month is bad. The fact that he doesn't argue with you means he probably doesn't think it's that big of a deal to argue about, but he shouldn't blow you off by asking if it's "that time of the month". So, maybe what I'm refering to as "craziness" is overreacting to the smallest of things.  I dunno.  Also, it's 11pm and I'm the last one up. Weird.  PS - Weezer, Tenacious D, and Jimmy Eat World on November 15th. I'll be there, will you?

      So, what do you mean by saying that girls are "crazy?"  I know that girls in general have this reputation of getting all emotional and think that their boyfriends "should be able to tell/know what is bothering them" or whatever. Is that what you mean by crazy? I think it's just that you just don't understand how we think. Or maybe you do understand how we think and you think it is "crazy." I know a guy (I won't mention any names, and no, it's not you Tim or Cahlen) that discounts anything I say when I'm a little upset because he thinks I'm making too big a deal out of such an unimportant issue... most often he asks if it's "that time of the month," as if that could discount the validity of what I'm saying to him. I have no idea whether or not any of this is making any sense to you who happen to be reading this blogg. Maybe I am just crazy. Or maybe it's just time to go to bed.

      THINK ABOUT IT!  After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and injured 1,000; President Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 U.S. sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.   Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 7,000 people in New York and Washington, D.C. that are now dead would be Alive today.   AN INTERESTING QUESTION:  This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in show.  Without casting stones, it is a legitimate question.  There are two men, both extremely wealthy.  One develops relatively cheap software and gives billions of dollars to charity.  The other sponsors  terrorism.   That being the case, why is it that the Clinton Administration spent more money chasing down Bill Gates over the past eight years than Osama bin Laden?    THINK ABOUT IT!  It is a strange turn of events. Hillary gets $8 Million for her forthcoming memoir.   Bill gets about $12 Million for his memoir yet to be written.  This from two people who have spent the past 8 years being unable to recall anything about past events while under oath!  Incredible!  THINK ABOUT IT!

      for those ladies in my life, and those reading this blog... I've discovered something in my 23 some odd years of life...  Women are crazy. This is not one of those sometimes, some of em, it's pretty much all of you:)  Not to say this is bad. In fact how could it be? I mean if it were all bad no one would hook up. The thing I've learned is that if you're a guy, you just need to find the girl who's level and type of craziness is compatible with yours. I mean, there's gonna be times, guys, when you'll be like, umm... what are you talking about, and she'll be like, you should know. And sometimes you gotta remember that no matter what she does, this might be the least crazy girl you'll ever meet.   I remember some times when different guys in my past have been like, "Tim, I dunno if I can put up with this craziness" and to be honest, I talk bad about girls sometimes, expecially when they interfere on guy time. (IE when I want to hang out with my guy friends, but they have to go spend time with their girlfriends) But I just tell em, "Look at this wonderful girl you got. Sure she's crazy sometimes, but they ALL are. You got a good one my friend" OK, so that happened like once, but I can pretend it happened more than that:) And no, don't worry ladies, it's no one that reads this blog;)  Well, check you latah, I'm getting up in 6.5 hours for running:) YAY

      Yay junk email. I just love getting spammed in my old email account. Of course, everything sent to that account is spam, for the most part, since I don't really use it anymore. At least I have a constant means of email though. Kinda like getting junk mail in the actual postal mail. It makes you feel almost alive, or at least that some junk mail list cares that you still exist.   Anyhowie... yes good old slow weekends. I got to work yesterday, then I just kinda vegged the rest of the weekend. I did change some of my room around, and hook up the neighbor-piss-off-anator (aka the home theater subwoofer, at least I turned it way down).   I need to win a million dollars. Or 100,000. That'd be nice too.

      hmmm... guess it's just back to me.Now for a story about Tim and "Melissa"...  A long time ago (aka a few years ago) Tim was just doing the school thing and what not, when he got this random email from "melissa". She said she had found my site on the school's server and wandered if we could be friends. Tim was like "sure" but then he asked "melissa" if she had a webpage(after a few emails back and forth) and she was like sure... and then she sent me this page about this person that had a sex change operation(not that those are bad, it just really shocked me) And then there was a delay in writing and she got all like, "did I scare you?" and I was all like "no". But then later my friend sent me a link with our little conversation written out on the internet for everyone to see. Up until that point, I had no reason to believe "melissa" was not who she said she was. But then my "friend" had just been playing me. So now if I get contacted from people on the internet, I get all paranoid.    Besides that, some of my real life "friends" do not like to contact me personally, they prefer to hide behind an AIM alias which has no real world connection. Unfortunately since they won't tell me who they are, I am forced to block them:(  C'est la vie....

      mmm... kinda a slow weekend on the blogger anyway. Spent saturday cleaning the house(much needed).  Oh and I drank a little. But nothing I couldn't handle:( Steve's gonna help me drink next week I think. Watched "The way of the gun" and "O brother where art thou?". I still love O brother, and the way was pretty good.  Definately worth the 9 bucks;)  I NEED CAFFEINE. ALSO, just got a phone call from someone cool;)

      So I just had the best time of my life ever... yes, EVER!!!    Imagine this, I'm driving onto the 520 bridge in horrible traffic with cops and ambulances passing us and I'm like frick, this is gonna freakin suck.  And all of a sudden my car starts shaking back and forth like freakin crazy, and I'm like, "Eh?"  Then I look at the other side of the bridge and it is swinging all over the place, and then these huge ass waves shower over my car and I'm like "Eh?"  So I sit there going 2 miles per hour and I'm like, "This freakin rocks!"  So I turn on some Coldplay and sit there swaying back and forth like I'm in a 8.0 earthquake for atleast 30 minutes, and my car is getting drenched, and I'm just chillin' thinking, "This is the coolest moment of my life..."  And then I got sea sick and almost threw up and I was like, "Freakin' A, I gotta get off this bridge..."

       The one thing we yearn for in our living days, that makes us sigh and groan and undergo sweet nauseas of all kinds, is the rememberance of some lost bliss that was probably experienced in the womb and can only be reproduced at death.  -Jack Keouac  I think that's why I like to take baths....

      and now for a poem by Tim:  Conversation with my best friend- How to explain this? I think about you everyday. It�s been a year since you were taken from our lives. We were supposed to go out with Michelle and Tracy that night. We were going to see a movie. I remember how you were going to talk to Tracy about how you liked her. But that never happened. I remember walking to school and thinking how that accident seemed really bad. I remember wondering where you were. Then the principal came over the intercom and everything stopped.   From that moment there has not been a moment that I don�t miss you. I remember how we used to just chill and play videogames. How you would smile all the time. I remember how good you were at sports. You would�ve made varsity this year for sure.  It�s been one year since you were on your way to school and that lady hit you coming around a corner too fast. She�s off paying her debt.   But what about you? There is no coming back. No homework to distract you. No person to call when I have a bad day. No one to talk with about her and what she might mean. I can feel I�m losing you. I�m sorry.

      So, I wrote this whole blogg one time already, and the dumb thing "couldn't establish a connection." And then it was all gone. So, I spouted obscenities to the computer and I'm typing it again.   I found this quote in the margins of my psychology book.   "I contend that nature has given males the heaviest burden of all: the burden of always having to Make the First Move, and thereby risk getting Shot Down. I don't know WHY males get stuck with this burden, but it's true throughout the animal kingdom.... It's always the male bird who does the courting dance, making a total moron of himself, while the female bird just stands there, looking aloof, thinking about what she's going to tell her girlfriends. ('And then he hopped around on one foot! Like I'm supposed to be impressed by THAT!')"  Acutally, in some species, it is NOT the males birds that have to do the song and dance. But in biology, there are always exceptions.

(for those ladies who don't know, they put "cakes" of pine scent in the urinals to cover up the smell of urine) I just think it's funny that someone would be a webaddress on something I piss on... weird.

      Someone recently asked me if I believe that there is 1 person out there for us.  I had to respond like this...  Yes and No, I did believe in the 1 true love thing, a while ago. However, I no longer believe in it. I believe that we make the love. We can create and destroy the love. There is no 1 person you must find. No predestination, Bill Gates was not predestined for the power he has. He took it.  hmm... sorry, got a little off track. I think that you can love multiple people. There are people that I will forever love, they have taken part of my heart with them. (I think there are 5 girls, but maybe only 4, i forget the exact count and I try not to think of them) I think no matter who you love, there will always be work involved in the relationship sometime or another. I mean you can't be in "love" forever, but you can love someone forever. Do you even understand what I'm saying?  Anyway, Harry potter was awesome, followed the book extremely well. "But I've never even been to Mars"

It's not like there's a whole lot happening with me these days... let's see, get up, look for jobs a few times during the day (online), play some games and whatnot, and go to bed.   I lead a thrilling life.   Oh, and Tim, don't forget the 1st step of being an alky, denial. :)

      A couple more things I guess...  So I won racquetball tonight. And while I was doing laps on the track I got started wondering why people would pick me as a friend. I didn't come up with any particular reason, except I must've tricked em good. I mean God knows I don't open up to people.   Jameson makes me warm.  Also, Mary, why is it Larry? LcCorkle? I mean, I'm just curious:) Did you have an operation? Like a name transplant or something?

      so, someone has been bugging me about blogging, so I figured I'd waited long enough:)  Well, actually, I'm supposed to go watch "Enterprise" now, but now I'm back from that:) weird how I can leave and come back and just keep typing like no time past and now you're reading this, like, "Tim you're on crack, it's the same damn message."  So, when I got the mail yesterday, Marc had sent us a postcard of a topless girl on a beach and was like, "I read a lot at the beach here", and then today when I got the mail there was a postcard for Austin. This one had a dude on the front and said, "Hey Austin, this beach has lots of topless men on it, it's pretty cool, you should come visit it" I almost pissed my pants I was laughing so hard.  N - E - way, I'm drinking a little Jameson tonight, just to keep me warm of course;) I'd say I was turning into an alky, but this is the first drink I've had in like a week and a half, so I wouldn't say that I am, but I'm doing like 2 of the 4 signs. Drinking by myself, and only drinking hard shit.  So, I've been really busy at work recently, my site went live. So I've been maintaining it. Trying to keep it running. Had to come home early today, because my brain broke down. (You know that time when you are overwhelmed with work to the point of not being able to function, that's the point I was at)  So I came home and bought the new Jewel album, much kicking of the ass:) Also got to play with the game cube, which I want more time with, cause I think it'll be much kick ass. (Played Rogue Squadron, very fun)  So, I'm really looking forward to the Tenacious D/Weezer/Jimmy Eat world concert tomorrow night. IT should kick some major boot�.  Well, I think I've blogged enough for right now, I'll check you dogs latah...  PS - I just checked Sunday hero and was shocked to see she'd changed her layout once again. I guess I'm just a guy that likes my layout, I think the blue helps to neutralize any angry feelings:)

      So now that I'm 24 and people like me again... I figured I should start blogging again...  Went up to the Lee's yesterday and celebrated the bday with them. Got, Grave of the Fireflies, for my bday, still need to watch it.  It's about midnight on sunday night/monday morning, and I just got done watching "snatch" in my room with big A. Now kevin is playing GT3. Over the past couple of days I've gotten, SSX Tricky, THPS3, Devil May Cry, and Spyhunter. Talk about being busy. I think we need more PS2's in the house:)  Also, I haven't heard from Brad, so I need to call him. Also, I finally got the games from the amazon. Those bitches. I'm watching some ifilms, right now, they're way funny.  Also, I just wanted to talk about how I love women. and how i do not understand them. But I think I've already talked about those two before, so I won't bore you. And another thing, Weezer is gonna rock....

      So another postless 24 hours... amazing. It must be just a dead time for writing for people.   I had a pretty awesome evening last night, hanging out with friends I haven't seen for a while. Another one of my friends is engaged... I can't believe it. I guess that's what happens when you don't get a chance to see someone for 6 months or so... wow. It was fun to talk finally though, after such a long time. It's amazing what can happen when you just decide to hang out and spontaneously call people :)

      Wow... no posts in 24 hours.   So anyways... I was going through my files and stuff on my computer, and stumbled across a bunch of old sent mail from like 4 years ago. So I started reading everything, and it was pretty crazy, just seeing what I was thinking/going through back then, and how much I've changed (some for the good, some for the bad). It's pretty cool to have this sort of record of thoughts from back then. I'm glad I saved everything.   On the job front, it's oh so encouraging to see about 15 whole new jobs posted this weekend. Wow... yeah, we're not in a recession or anything right now. riiiighhhtt.

      DAMN YOU GUYS!!!  Best movie month this year = December... I know a lot of good movies have come out recently, but just look at the dates...  Dec. 18 = Moulin Rouge hits DVD, You know I HAVE to own this movie. Especially since I DO consider it one of the greatest films ever. Dec. 19 = LORD OF THE RINGS hits theatres nationwide.  These will be my 2 favorite movie days I believe. Also, I think maybe they'll do a midnight showing of LOTR at Cinerama and you know I'm all over that, if I can get tickets. I mean it's fuckin' LOTR.   Oh so my yesterday... I went to church in the morning with Big A and Cliff and Hannah. Then we went to Thai food afterward. mmmm... Thai food. (items ordered: vegi Red Curry***, something fire**, cashew chicken***, and Pud Thai Chicken**:)) Then we went and saw Monsters, Inc at Oaktree. It was fun, and we got to see the Episode 2 teaser. Then we came back here and I got a headache, so I was in bed from 6pm till 7:15 this morning.  hmm.... my birthday is on saturday, in case anyone was curious:)  Have a good day everyone...

      in the dream I play an almost 24 yr old male looking for a job... Actually in all accounts, the dream me would seem real in this dream world...  "Today's story is called, 'Albert the clown', written by Andy, age 29. Wonder who that could be? There was once this funny clown and his name was Albert. Sometimes people tried to be CUTE and pronounce his name in french, which was 'Al-bear'. People did this so much that Albert started believing he WAS bear. He moved to the forest of the Northwestern United States, to live on nuts and berries. Soon, 'Al-bear', became a tall hairy man with long hair and fingernails and bare feet. Because he was an ex-clown, he had BIG, HUGE FEET. Today 'Albert the clown' is better known as big foot. So the next time you're camping in the great Northwest, remember to raise a big 'Hey-diddly-o' to 'Al-bear'." -  urlLink Brak

      in some weird twist of fate, what is real?  I'm pretty much sure I'm a figment of someone's imagination... But I couldn't be forsure. This dream sure is interesting.  Maybe cahlen is on to something. (his loving sleep, kevin too)... What if we're living a dream, and at night we go and lie in our beds and wake up. When in this dream we think we're awake...  Oh what an interesting thought....

       Happy New Year  Well, almost anyway. It's work day for Tim!!! WOoohooo!!!! :P  Anyway, I went to the sonics game on saturday night. It was sweeeet. 13th row. Free Beer and food. fun time by all (cliff was there). Then we went to the music store to wait for traffic to die down, and Gary Payton came in and was looking through the DVDs. It was soooo cool:)   Yesterday, I played games with cliff till around 6:30 when Marc came over and we went and ate mongolian food. Then Cliff went to Hannah's and Marc and I played Galactic Battlegrounds. Then we watched Malcolm in the middle, which was funny, but I think it was a rerun. Afterwards we watched the last half of Half baked. and then marc went home and I finished up my second year of football.  Now it's new years eve and I'm at work. Check you latah- T

       mmmm.... tits:)   hehehe.... well I went to some bars tonight with cliff and Corey. And there was this girl there. She was pretty muscular and had on this tiny little t-shirt that said hustler. Anyway, she did this little dance thing with her ass and tits and then occasionally she would lift up her shirt to reveal, no bra:) I was the only one watching (of the 3 of us) so cliff and Corey were both disappointed:) oh, maybe next time:)

      Thanks for taking care of that crazy code thing.  Oh, and I agree about talking people at movie theaters. Or Cell Phone users, little kids running around/talking/kicking seats/crying, laser pointer users, etc. They should all be summarily smacked by everyone else in the audience on they're way out. Kinda like that movie commercial that shows the person getting pegged by stuff while talking on a cell phone.

       movie annoyance  Tonight, as I watched fellowship of the ring again, I had the privilage of sitting next to a very pleasant chap. That is to say, after talking on his cell phone during the previews, quite loudly, to billy bob, he proceeded to talk to his girl throughtout the movie. What I especially enjoyed, was when he pulled out his chewing tabacco. Fortunately he had snuck in a can of pop so he had a place to spit, otherwise who knows where it might have ended up. Needless to say, I didn't thoroughly enjoy sitting next to mr. "breathes extremely loud". Maybe next time I'll not see it in Woodinville, perhaps that would help.   christmas/workmas  I'm back from christmas at home. I went home friday evening around 9 pm.WEnt to a kick ass party at Amidys on saturday night. Unfortunately, i lost my voice that night, plus I had to get up at 5:30 to drive down to fuckin corvallis. Oh well, I got to see my grammie. She has alzheimers a little. So she can't really remember people. On monday my work called, even though I was in OR, to tell me the network was down, even though there was someone in seattle that was on call. So I worked for 30 mins on monday. Joy.   For christmas I got, Shrek, Episode 1, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and final fantasy. Oh and I got some clothes and a gift card for target and some cashola. Not a bad christmas, but I really need to be at work tomorrow for a full 10 hours. So I'm going now.  TTYL- T

       crowds  Did I ever tell you how much I enjoy my solitude. or maybe how much I hate the crowds at stores and malls? Sometimes I think that children should have to remain at home, then they wouldn't be running into me at the store.  Thank God I got my christmas shopping done. And the presents are wrapped.  Tomorrow the neices and nephews show up.... *sigh*  I'm still sick but at least I got drugs. Looking forward to the party tonight. I think my mom wanted me to be all excited about the presents for me under the tree. It was just difficult getting excited after driving down, being sick, and the shit hanging over my head right now. you know?  Sometimes it feels like all I do is complain. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more jovial:( maybe next year. T

       Drugged and Awestruck  so I saw Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the ring, twice last night. It was so awesome. It makes me want to see the next one. AWESOME is probably the only way I can describe it.  Unfortunately, all week I've been staying up late and getting up early and now I'm sick. Fortunately, I have dayquil to give me a buzz:)

      Ahh... How come, as a society, have we replaced 'why' with 'how come'? I mean I was thinking about this last night as I drifted off to bed and I was thinking how little sense 'how come' means. I mean, really, where did it come from?   How come we can use 'how come'? or why don't we just use 'why'? or why do we use 'how come'? How come we don't use 'why'?  weird, 4 sentances with basically the same meaning...  HOW COME?!?!?!

      How come women can be like, 'You don't pay me enough attention?' I mean, after all you've done for her?  You tell her you love her, you spend free time with her. You buy her flowers. What do you want? How can we make you know that we love you, yet not have to spend every ounce of energy trying to prove it. Can you not just be delighted in knowing we love you?  Why is it any time I want to spend any time with my friends you say, "You don't care about me, just go do whatever you want to do..." and then turn a cold shoulder. Do you honestly believe that that makes us want to spend more time with you?  Grow up! Don't make us always decide what we're going to do. If there's something you'd like to do, then TELL US.  we aren't living in the 20's, you can tell us what you'd like to do, you don't have to be content with whatever we plan to do.  God knows it would help us alot.  Thanks- Guys

All in all a pretty normal week:)  I haven't turned on my computer at home since monday morning. so hopefully the electric will be less next month. :) Anyway, 1 week till LOTR. I'm pretty damn stoked.  Saw, Ocean's 11 last weekend, twice. Do you think I liked it? I thought it was good, but there were some times when I knew what was happening. Well, Jarred is trying to convince me to become a screenwriter, so maybe I'll do that. It sounds like a fun job.  Peace

      So it's sunday night now...   Yesterday my internet went down until an undisclosed time, but it turns out, it was just until today.  It's been a super busy weekend. Brad bailed, so we're looking for a roommate. Marc might be thinking about it, but I doubt he'll accept. Even for a few months:( Cliff has someone interested, so we'll see about him.   Friday night, I went to tradition, but it was mostly boring, but I got to see lots of cool people. Then on saturday I cleaned up the downstairs. and dejah came over and we watched, X, Emporer's new groove, and 2 episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. It was fun. After I dropped of Dej, I came home and watched, Zero Effect with Kevin and Cliff. It was fun, but I stayed up way too late (3:30 am)  Got up for church at 9:30 (actually got up at 9:50) and then we got to church at 11am(it only starts at 10:30:) Oh well, it was fun. Then I had lunch at Rosita's and then went to REI with Dej. Worked from 3 - 4 then went home and saw "Spy game" with Kevin and Craig. It was a good movie, but I can only handle Craig in very small doses.   Ugh, anyway, I watched Malcolm and Simpson's with Cahlen then we came down here and watched the last 2 episodes of Evangelion. I wan't to watch them all, but unfortunately dejah doesn't have them all for me to borrow:(  Well, I've now rambled and made a huge post, when I can't even read huge posts:( And now, I'm watching Gunbuster episode 3 on the internet, so what can I say? I'm an anime slut:)  Catch you on the flip side:) T

Well, as you may or may not know, I love comic books (even though i was never allowed to have them when I was younger cause of the devil), and anyway, he's gonna bring me some:) YAY!!!  Also, I wanted to point out that my friend  urlLink Nate  got a blog going.   So I just want to give a shout out to all my peeps and tell ya to go give Nate a visit:) Peace- T

(I know that alot is not a word, but I still use it, in fact I use a lot very often) :)  Does it make me a hypocrite? I mean, should I have to live in a world where my boss cannot spell routine, and then he misspells it like 420 times? yet, since I can't spell "a lot",  I am a hypocrite? (PS- I can't spell hypocrite either)   Well, I'm done on my little spelling defense, peace out- T

      Also, I was just talking with Nate (whose wife thinks I'm addicted to computers and not books so I thought I'd let you all in on my response to that)  Basically, it's the "If I had unlimited time and resources question" or better known as "If I won the lottery question" If I won the lottery...  I would buy 3 houses... In one house I would have my friends, my TV's, my video games, my Computers, all my technical stuffs. (1st house)  In one other house, I would have a library, and a fireplace. (2nd house)  In my 3 house, I would have my pool, my pool table and my other fun shiznit. (3rd house)  So I would live in the first house, invite my friends to my 3rd house for fun times(also have wild parties there) and then retreat to my 2nd house whenever I was feeling like I wanted to get away.  So my explanation for not reading as much as i can right now, is that I am too distracted and do not have enough time right now to both be sociable and read alot...  Ahh, it's good to dream.

It's snowing outside, and I'm hoping to work from home at least a little tomorrow. It's finally sticking to the roads, but not our driveway. Weird.  So anyway, I got an email from  urlLink my friend , and figured that was a good reason enough to send you all(you know who you are, all my invisi-friends:)) to her. So there.  Also, you'll notice my shameless plug earlier about my unwelcome hero. I'm thinking of putting part of my intro for my book up... we'll see how drunk I get tonight;) (that's where cliff and his friends went, to buy alky:) $125 worth :P WooHOO!!!

       Disdain  - The feeling Tim has for his boss.  here it is again, I almost called in sick today. I wish I had. Oh well, the other guy called in sick today, so I guess it's good I showed up.  For some Odd reason, I feel that setting up my voicemail isn't that important... Of course it might have to do with the fact that I know I'm leaving, and my boss doesn't. Damn 2 week notifications.  Anyway, I am back on my "wanting to write" stick, but am yet somehow distracted by other things(final fantasy).  I hope Amidy had a nice time on her birthday weekend.

       Mmm.... The Weekend:)    Had another "all nighter" last night, that is, I went to sleep around 6am after playing Final Fantasy all night long. Then got up at 12:30 and played until like 2 when I ate. It started snowing around 3:10 and kevin and I went and saw Orange County. Not as funny as I was hoping, but it was kinda a feel good movie I guess.  So I don't know the point where I became cynical of movies.... (saw a preview for some shitty looking movie about a kid that gets a watch that speeds up the user) I mean, I'm thinking that I wouldn't even go to that movie if someone paid me, well, maybe if they were paying me to write a review of it, so I could stop other people from seeing it.  *sigh* oh well,  On the other hand, we(kevin, Jarred, and I) watched  urlLink Buckaroo Banzai  last night. That was a funny ass movie. Probably would have enjoyed it better drunk, but you can only be drunk so much;)  Hmm... speaking of which, I haven't spoken to my girls in awhile. (probably cause they found out that I call them my girls:)) Plus, I've been working nonstop and all that shit:P  Gotta bug the Volt lady about videogames again this week. Gotta work on my resume tomorrow.  Peace- T

      So, when I got home last night, I go out to get the mail and I hear this "hissing" coming from my car. So it turns out that it's my left rear tire. I moved it down to the bottom of the driveway(flat part in the road). So this morning I get to change the tire and take it to  urlLink discount tires  again. (note: see wednesday for the last time I had to go to discount tires to fix a flat)  Why can't seattle have streets that don't eat my tires? I mean it, it's like every God Damn place I go in this city, there's fuckin potholes everywhere.  in logical progression(in tim thought anyway) I AM anal about spelling. I keep on bugging the receptionist about the copier tracking sheet that read "Lazer printer". I mean really, fucking Z's in Laser? It's that kind of shit that pisses me off:) Also, have i told you like how I work with these people that couldn't spell their way out of a bag? Like my boss, he's always mispelling shit, and then he can't write anything that anyone could read. People are all asking each other, "WHAT THE FUCK is THAT word?"  this concludes my rantings for right now:) I gotta go change a tire...

I mean it wouldn't be so bad if you thought it was supposed to take this long. I mean this shit on any other computer in the office only took like 5-10 minutes. But here, on this POS, I'm stuck with 37 minutes left:P  Oh well, at least it means I'll type more;) I'm going to Squish and Dan's on the 12th if anyone wants to come. They said to invite you:) (ok, they only named 2, but I'm sure they're cool with meeting new peeps;)) Also, they got a house, so there should be enough room for us all.  Well, it's true, the more I type the faster it goes. So, I'm now also downloading,  urlLink this piece of spam shit  that my boss paid for. That's actually been my entire job over the past 2 days. Get a computer that he can Terminal Service into and set up that program on....  The sad thing, the program is downloading at 83 KB/sec, the fuckin IE6 more like 10KB/sec:P  You'd think MS, being across the lake as it is would be faster, but NOoooOOOOoooo, poop on them:)  Jeopardy theme song... "Do do do do Do Do Doooo, Do do do do DO, do do do do do...."  Would somebody please STOP THE INSANITY????!?!?!?!  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)

      also, the update seems to be going faster when I'm logged into blogger, so I'm gonna continure to type till it gets done... :)  basically, now I'm the guy at work everyone comes to to get shit done. A computer breaks, ask Tim, the internet goes down, ask Tim. There's a pregnant lady giving birth in the lobby, ask tim. :)  hehehe, OK so the damn thing stopped again. Windows update sucks, when it gets stuck. And another thing, we lose internet connectivity here, way too damn much. Like at least once a week now.  FUCKER, it got stuck at 964, AGAIN!!!!  Now, I'm a grumpy grape. :(

       weird ass dreams   So it all starts out that I'm going to a movie(weird;)) Anyway, we get to the place the movie was playing(it was an old movie, so it wasn't playing at a theater. Turns out, it's playing at the charismatic, non-denominational church that I went to during my fomative years. (aka 6 - 13) Anyway, I get there and there's some typical seattle people hanging out for when the shows gonna start. (shows gonna start at like 7pm and it's only like 4) (I figure the movie is pretty popular with people getting there so early)   Anyway, I go talk to some girls and take a drag off their roach, then I'm like I'll be back. So I head for the church and I see this girl that I used to like back in HS. And I'm like, what're you doing here, what's going on.... blah blah blah, and she's heading into the church so I follow her. Well, it turns out that there's a service going on right now, and I'm like, what the fuck, might as well. So I follow her in and sit in the back, half facing away from the preacher.  Well, basically, I sit through the service and am about to leave and go chill withh those girls before the show. But as I'm leaving, I pass my mom (in my old kitchen, which of course was never in that church building, but somehow ended up there in a dream?!?!) And she's like, the movie's not playing tonight. And I'm like, "C'mon mom, everyone is here to see it", and she's like "No, I'm making diner and Fred is coming over to catch up on old times" (now the thing is, Fred was like this guy that my mom found solace with right after my dad left, in like 1980, so it's not like I even remember the guy, and what is he doing in my dream?)   So I go outside and tell all these peeps that the movie's not going to be shown, and they're all sad. But then later I gave oral pleasures to that girl who I smoked with... and then my alarm went off.  Quite a night for the old Tim:)

      hmm... well, I'm a  4.7 on hot or not .com :( C'est la vie.  I'm drunk again. After "BRotherhood of the wolf" today at 5:30 Corry(our new roommate) and me went out. We went to Hooters and McCormicks and Paragon and Pesos. Needless to say I had a lot to drink. Basically, I told Corry to take off saturdays so we could go to bars on hopping nights, but that's not going to happen.  Also, Cahlen is a mother fucker. He gets FFX yesterday, then he takes it home with him today. Basically, I hate him:P  I'm tired and my teeth feel funny:) Check you latah- T

My coworker is complaing cause he doesn't want me leaving him with the boss from hell, but I'm moving to greener pastures. I got to work at 7 yesterday, and I'm shooting for 8 today:P UGh, I'm gonna go in late on friday I think.  Anyway, Hope you are all having a good time. Check you latah- T

      Another weekend....  Well, I'm working on this beautiful saturday afternoon. We got a new roommate, Cory. He's cool. It's all mundane work, but I like the fact that I don't have to think, I can just print and stack. Print and stack.  Watched Twin peaks first 4 episodes last night. Very interesting show.  Well, back to the daily grind:) T

      I am the candy man:)  Well, really happy new years now. :) So, I partied at eric's last night. That means that we drank lots, but I think this cold is fucking with me or something because I swear I can't get really drunk anymore. It's kinda sad for me really:( I mean if I get drunk it's for like 5 minutes.  Anyway, I have to drive cliff to issaquah in like 20 to get his car. We decided to car pool back to our house after cliff was drunk. It was cool, we went the speed limit the whole way and didn't have any problems.  I got an email from MS yesterday and they want me to play videogames for them again, to which I'm pretty sure that I'm going to say yes to. I mean it's videogames and room for promotion, whereas this job that I have now is like, no room for growth, but you can put down a kickass job title if you want:P  Well, after drinks, cards and xbox at Erics we came back here and talked with the Kelley, Justin, Amidy, Jebe and Kevin. Which was fun, but we stayed up till 4:30 and now it's 12:12 and I have to drive cliff to his car to get to work on time. He's all hung over:(  But I'm listening to Aqua, so everything is dum de da de da:)  Roses are red, violets are blue, honey is sweet, but not as sweet as you:) -Aqua

       Dads   Went to mine this weekend. Going to go visit Big Steve in San Diego in April. That'll be fun. Finished American Gods and the star wars book I was reading. Now I'm reading the princess bride. It's pretty good. Reminds me a lot of the movie:) Funny and all:)  Anyway, I got better games to test this week. So that's really happy.  Catch y'all latah

       ahh 4 page reports:)   So, we've been playing this game this week that isn't stable. That means it'll crash for no apparent reason. Which is fun:) Plus they only have the 1st mission complete so once you're done with it, blah blah blah, you get the point.  Needless to say, I ran out of work on tuesday, and mostly am just flying around hoping it doesn't crash.  So, our fridge started leaking at my house. That was pretty exciting. The landlord is coming on saturday to fix it. At least this way he'll think we we're doing dishes cause of the water being out. Instead of whoever that doesn't do their dishes.  So, I've been getting home at 11 and then I get up at 6:30. It's pretty damn tiresome.  Hope you all are doing good.  PS - "American Gods" rocks PPS - it's a book

       and now, a look at the upbringing of me  (aka how come you can't meet any nice guys)    growing up in our christian households we're told that as soon as you have sex you're going to get AIDS. or at least some sort of STD. Then you'll have to live with that for the rest of your days. And then, even if you find someone that you won't get an STD from, then you'll get her pregnant and you don't want a kid now do you?   Then there's the 80's when it seemed like everytime I saw a movie the women didn't want to have sex with the man and then he got thrown in jail. and so it seemed like there was no woman that wanted to have sex, so if you ever tried anything with a girl, she was going to be like, Date Rape. So don't even try it.   Then when you get out in the real, real world. (aka after college, or in college if you don't go to a private christian university, or aren't me) then you realize that girls wanna have sex also, but you've had it drilled into you since you were just a little kid, and you can't figure out what to do. I mean you're as horny as hell, but you're so scared of gettin some disease, you're left an outcast, by your own choosing.

Go get oil changed at 10 in order to be home for Houck's visit at 11:45ish.   Oil change gets done at 12:30, Houck's waiting when I get home. Get Manga:)   Eat lunch with Kevin and Houck at Olive Garden(Cafe Veloce was closed)   Back to the house for a little Simpsons road rage.  Next stop, Jarred's for reading Manga/comics/books/slam dunk contest.  7:45 - dinner at piecola's(sp?)  9:10 - Metropolis (Excellent movie)  11:30 - drive home:) (Cliff got yelled at by the crazy lady 2 doors down, "FUCK YOU CRAZY LADY")  Thumbs hurt from too much comic book reading.

       heh      ok, so I've talked to lots of people online. (well, my buddy list is like 46 strong, given I don't talk to all of them, but some) Anyway, I was just wondering what the FUCK "heh" means. I mean, I've talked to about 10 people that use it. Are you trying to say Hey? or are you almost laughing? like, "heh, that was almost funny enough for a hehe, but you're a fuckin tard, so I'll only give you a heh". So if someone could please explain this mysterious word for me, I would be most appreciative.

       Pete's   So, I had an ok day at work. Basically since I don't care if anything gets done, I've become a lot less stressed.  Had dinner at Pete's Calzone and pizza place. I love that shit. It's the best. It was good to see Dej again. Been like forever since I saw her last. Also, Megan was there. In case you can't remember she was the waitress there way back when I started going. It was weird cause we had the Pete's combo pizza with breadsticks and pepsi, and she's all like, you're still getting that. and I'm like yep, haven't changed. But really, I usually order like calzone with feta cheese and sundried tomatoes, it's just tonight I felt like pizza.  Sometimes I wish I were a performing artist. Singer/Guitarist/Speaker  Sometimes

       superbowl?/Whatever   So the superbowl was "interesting". Ate lotsa food and drank lotsa pop.  In case Trav still reads my blog occasionally, I believe "brim full of Asha" by "cornershop" is the song you're looking for. at least that's what a  urlLink friend  told me.  Also, my boss is a tard. I don't remember how many times I've told him to run a program from the server, but it has to have been a lot!!! But today, I get like a 20 min Voicemail about how he's going to blow his top if he can't run it, and he's tried everyway imaginable to run it, so Tim you must unfuck it up.  Ass

       1 down, 1 to go   Had a party last night. Well, it started at 2, and I was drunk by 3. But I didn't stop drinking till 10. So, it was a fun party:)  Also, we cleaned the garage(at least figured out what was trash, and what wasn't) yesterday morning.  And now, we're hanving a super bowl party today. So that should be fun. WE're having Pizza, pop, and chips. Maybe even a bit of a pool. (we'll see)  Well, I'm gonna try and get over this "headache" Peace- T  PS- So far we've figured my team consists of all the cool guys from my team, + 2 guys. (Cool guys from my team = Nate, Brad, Brothers Green, Jeremy and me)

       snip, snip, I just took down the internet    clip, clip, now it's back up   So, I was trying to get this one tenant's connection working, since when he switched to XP something got fucked up and he has to use this little ass cord. So, I cut this cord that we think isn't connected to anything, but then Matt comes and says, "The internet is down and we can't connect to the server." anyway, I'm the first one to be like, umm... maybe it's that cord I just cut, even though it's blue and the one in the server room is white. Well, we trace the cord and low and behold it connects to a blue one.  Well, the guy who had to use a shorter cord, has been using 2 hooked together this week, so I moved him to a short one and a different office for right then, and took his linker guy. then I clipped ends on the the cable I just cut and put them together while Matt went and got more patcher guys.  That is my story for the day.... The end

       inspiration   Since we last talked... Amorah got married, I got to dance with D at the wedding, Cory didn't get the job yet, I had an interview with another MS group, I finished "choke", I watched Blade 2, twice, and tonight I watched the Lord of the Rings again:) This time with the Two Towers Preview on the end:)  The LOTR:FOTR DVD info was released...  urlLink here   It's almost easter time, and I need to figure out what's going on. I think I might be going with Kevin, but he may have already left, dunno. I guess I'll find out in the morning.  The Two Towers looks INCREDIBLE. I am mostly looking forward to the riders of Rohan, as well as the Ents. Man oh man, I can hardly wait...

(today)  Nostalgia, I read a little of my travel journal last night, it's amazing how I can go back there. Just a word, a smell, a picture, I can almost remember it like it's today. Yet I can't remember what I did 2 days ago. I can't remember the movies I saw last week, let alone last year. I can tell you the main characters major malfunction in every Chuck Palahniuk book, yet can't really remember the characters from the Lord of the rings(at least the ones not in theaters right now)  Is my life passing me one day at a time? or is it a year at a time?  I think I've lost all sense of time

       OT   So, I worked 25 hours this weekend. This seems to be a great amount of work. I mean, if you only count the weekend days, (sat. & sun) you get 48 hours, of which I spent more than half in a building at MS.  Anyway, it was nice to have Jebe and Kelley in the house again. Also got to see Dejah and Amorah this week. So that was nice.  what else...  Saw Time machine on friday night. Not a bad movie, could have had more of a more completeness. It left you wanting at least another 30 minutes or something.   Worked till midnight last night, worked till 9 tonight. Last day off was February 24th. Hmm.. how time flies...  Thanks for being in my life- T

       Beautiful Mind   Went and saw "Beautiful Mind" tonight.It was really good. There were 7 people at the movie. 3 girls, 4 boys, can you guess who didn't have a date:)  I don't know, I think I should move out of the boonies. It's hard enough to ask if a girl would like to do something, w/o having to drive 30 minutes to get her. it makes it difficult to be spontaneous.  Also, can I tell you that my girl contact has about reached 0. (Not really true, I saw Jebe and Kelley tonight, but they don't count cause they're here for kevin, I just get the pleasure of their company when Jebe is in town, (also Jebe and Kelley, thanks for hanging out and not dissing me, sorry I couldn't let you drive my car, but I think Amidy would have killed me)) However, back to the original point. I can't remember the last time I met a new girl. Especially, the last time I met a girl and didn't make a total ass out of myself.  2 of My flaws: 1) Not thinking before I speak, and closely related, 2) Speaking whatever's on my mind.  (Usually this involves sex or trying to find out intimate information about the person I'm sitting across from. which in turn makes them embarassed)  Then later I become annoying, and also, I don't pay enough attention to them. (Major flaw on my part, but I have trouble focusing)  The alarm clock comes soon, so I'll be going to bed. God Bless- T

       grief   It seems that grief is a very lonely feeling. No one knows how you feel and they try to empathize with you, but they don't know the hurt or the pain. So there is no comfort in friends. I guess having someone to talk with it about is good.      Can you see that? The emotional exhaustion? Can you see the dried tears? Can you tell when I don't feel up to snuff? Is it invisible? Does it appear as a hang over? Or something more believable?

I think I figured out living arrangements for after june. Work is going good. Light house, my church thing on tuesdays is great.  Umm... I saw Adam on wednesday. That was fun. He lives in Tenino right now and so he's a lot closer than home.  Houck is up again this weekend. So he'll be stopping by around dinner time. YAY. The comic book thing last weekend was really good. If you go to my links for my other sites, you'll notice I discontinued service due to my lack of time to work on them.  Anyway, hope you all are doing good and I'll check yous latah- T

       no wonder   So it's april 10th. No significance in that. Brad's replacement started yesterday. Dash, I forget his real name. Funny how I can just refer to my coworkers by their game names. It works, but it's kinda weird. Especially at Red Robin, it seemed a bit wierd.  Anyway, Church group was good last night. Met some people finally. As you may or may not know, I'm only an outgoing person when I want to be. And if I'm comfortable, I may not be as friendly as I should be. So anyway, it was good to be more friendly and get to know people-ish.  I'm going to see "FOTR" again on saturday. Did I mention that I LOVE that movie? :)  Also, Houck is coming up this weekend, and we're going to go to a comic book exchange on sunday. YAY:)  Anyway, for more excitement check  urlLink this  out.  Ciao- T

       The Thursday   Well, I found out last night that I would not be leaving Recon, but it's all good. They basically felt I could do the job, but that some other people were more qualified.So that's good. I'm going to study more, before the next opportunity comes up.  Check you latah- T

       The interview   had my interview this morning. As I keep thinking about it, I am getting more doubts. I wish I had answered a question more organizationally. Anyway, hindsight is 20/20 and I'm living the hindsight life. Last night the upstairs bathroom leaked water into my befroom until about 12:30am. I didn't find out about it till around 11:30 and I don't know how long it was leaking before that.  The waiting is the hard part.I can't help wondering, hoping, worrying... maybe I'll go to bed early and I'll have a nice surprise... (Christmas memories come back like a flash) No, no surprises, I just want the job.   *sigh*

       all good things   It's time to pack and say goodbye... Fuck the neighbors with their hateful stares...  and their damn suggestions... how bout this, You can go take care of your yard and live your perfect lives... But not ME... I will not mow the lawn, I WILL let the forest grow, and take my garden... Let nature do it's thing, I care not...  Yesterday I had my last party, much to my neighbors delight I suppose... too much fucking shit for them to deal with...  Is it too hard to live this life without boundries? Can you find a boundry that you have and won't cross that seems infintile? You can't go to a nude beach because why? You can't say the word "fuck" because why?  Are you listening to what others say? Can you not challenge your ideas? Will you not challenge your ideas?  Who says you're going to hell? I'm pretty sure, last time I checked, that was up to God.  peace

       HOUSE FOUND!!!!   We found a house today. We'll be living in Ballard about 4 blocks from the main drag. We ended up eating lunch at the vegetarian Australian food place. It was so delicious and they had this dessert that was just SOOOOOOO good. I can see that it may be a very tempting place to eat once we move to the new place.  I HATE cutting it to 20 days before we move. I wished we could have found a new place sooner, but I'm really happy with the place we've found.  Peace, and hope you're having a good life- T

Anyway, I do.   Well, it's time to Rock, I'll catch you on the flip side...

       update   So cliff and hannah are married. And they're back from their honeymoon. It was a very emotional wedding, at least for us guys. We were all in tears, while the ladies kept a firm upper lip:) Hmmm... role reversal?  Anyway, I'm moving to my new house next weekend. So I need to repack all the shit that I've unpacked, but at least it isn't as much as last time.  So, I'm still going to be lead for my group. I was working on something, but I was overshooting my experience. It was a GREAT experience and I've come away a stronger person. That being said, I'd like to get job offers for my 100 day break. I'll be accepting emails at my  urlLink email   If you're veisiting from malaysia, please have sarahkate email me cause I lost her link and stuff. Thanks  Peace- -T   PS- "hi"

       travelling   I was going to come home and work on my Neverwinternights, but then I was like, actually I'd like to watch some "Bring it on", so I did. Then I was like, ok, now I'll go upstairs and work on my NWN game, but now I'm listening to some classic 80's rock and I don't want to turn it off. So, I'm writing on my BLOG and thinking about travelling.  Today at lunch, one of the peeps that I work with started talking about NZ and europe and travelling in general and it stired my blood. There's just something about getting away for a few relaxing weeks and not having anything to think about. *sighs*  Anyway, I'm skipping church tonight cause I'm gonna go to bed earlier than it's going to get over with:( I'm gonna go when I don't have to wake up so early. AKA december  gnight

       back up and kickin   Well, I'm moved. I'm still living in Seattle, but now I'm living by the U district instead of ballard. It's a shorter commute and I've been working for the last month. When I say I've been working for the last month, I mean, 30 days straight no breaks. 2 weekends I worked 24 out of the 48 hours. It was hard, but the paychecks are nice.    N-E-way, I'll be taking november off to go and visit peeps, like steve and my pops. So, I hope to be inspired a little more often now that I have some free time.   Catch you latah- T

       update   I recently read that to keep a good *cartoon* site is to make regular updates. So I'm gonna try and do that...  On that note, I tried to go to  urlLink justbecause.com  tonight and was disappointed to see that it was either a) not functioning or b) my silly internet provider was acting up again. Either way, I'd like to see something there. I think it's supposed to be a flower shop, but I'm not sure.  Also, I've been out of work now for about 3 or 4 weeks. I had/have a "on call" job, but they aren't calling. So I'm thinking of giving plasma. They'll give me 125 for 4 visits. that's 2 weeks worth of plasma giving and I get 125 bucks.  That would decrease the need for me to call my parents every few weeks to bail me out. Which I HATE doing. It's not that they don't help me, it just seems that at this point in my life I should have a stable enough income that I shouldn't have to ask my parents for anything..  Anyway, I'm going home for thanksgiving. If you're reading this and would like me to maybe update a little more regularly, you can send me an email  urlLink here   Peace- T

       Christmas   Well, I got through the 2 towers. I've seen it 4 times now. I kinda liked it:)  Anyway, Christmas with the fam was fun. There were lots of little ones running around. Which gets us to the point that some people think I hate kids. Which isn't true. It's just when they're in large groups that I get overwhelmed and must seek refuge in a secluded room. (1 annoying thing was they kept going into my room which was off limits:P )  Anyway, I hope you all had a nice christmas and I'll talk to you latah... -T

       Cahlen's back?!?   Well, it's officially 47 hours from the start of the two towers at  urlLink The Cinerama  I'm a little stoked.  So anyway, Cal was here last week and I'm doing good. We played lots of games and watched lots of movies. Unlike most unemploywed bums:)  Well, I decided against giving plasma for the time being, mostly because I couldn't find anyone to go with me, but also because the state decided to give me a few extra dollars.   Well, I'm going to run. Have a great week! -T

       Half way there   Although I did get 1 request to make this more than just a once a month blog, I have found that I'm not that motivated.   Mostly because of games and movies: Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 Warcraft 3 Neverwinter Nights Sid Meier's Sim Golf and I'm watching all sorts of movies that my roommate Dan owns.  Tonight I watched... Undercover Brother, Pitch Black, and Life as a House. It's because of "Life" that I think I'm writing here, now.  My roommate presented me with a term about someone they knew. They called them "Asexual" which I realized is how some of my friends and I live our lives. I have this huge fear of rejection ingrained in my being. I think it's made me rather prude when I think that there's lots of girls who wouldn't have rejected a kiss by yours truly.  I'm 25 now. Still a virgin, although I think my mom doubts it. And I'd love to get a girlfriend and settle down. It's just I don't know how... T

       And now some blogger luvin   So, I've been having computer issues recently. Seems my HD is going bad:(  Anyway, the other thing it's been doing is signing me in and out of messenger service like a cop in a donut shop :) Wait... am I mixing metaphors? or just not using the right one?  Anyway, life is good. I found salmon burgers and have fallen madly in love with their low carbs, omega 3 fatty acids, and all around tasty-ness. Now if I just had unlimited amounts of money I could just live on brocolli, salmon, asparagus, cheese, crystal light, and diet mt. dew for the rest of my days. I think I could handle that.  *sigh*  back to work- Tim

       All things hotmail   What is UP with the damn hotmail. I'm like tryint to write an email to a friend and have to go look up an address. When I try and come back to hotmail, I usually hit a damn sidebar by accident, then the whole damn email disappears. It's like, "look, FUCKERS, if you're gonna have advertising all over my email at least you could have it open a new window, so I don't have to remember what I just typed"  BASTARDS  So I went and got a grill from the house last night. Ended up getting the charcoal grill as it was 50 bucks and I had just spent a load at costco on junk.   I've been playing Star Wars galaxies fairly often. So that's something. Now if my room weren't like 5 billion degrees I could actually spend some of my time at home developing my character.  OK, it's work time. Peace out- Tim

      So long, so long, well, let's see, I'm working at MS again. Playing videogames for the man:) I'm still living in the University district here in Seattle washington. We're coming up on our year lease and I've decided to live here another year.   We're having to replace two roommates... Cindy :( and Sean :)  So, I'm kinda sad cindy is leaving. I'm pretty sure we won't get a girl to replace her, and there's just something nice about living with a girl, you know? Plus I feel like I've just gotten to know cindy and now she's moving to idaho:( Also, girls are clean, which is to say, much different than boys:)  and now on to sean...  OK, so if you're going to be an alcoholic, don't be an ass about it. And if you're going to fall off the wagon, don't do it in my living room. Got home thursday night and Sean was drunk. He then continued to be beligerent/drunk all weekend long. It was fuckin AWESOME. oh wait, was that sarcasm ;-)  Well, I should get back to work, if anyone reads this please email me:) I've missed you all so much ;)

       The idea of human nature   So the question is this: Are people naturally good, or naturally evil, or a product of their environment?  By and large, I would have to say, I have felt that people are naturally good. I think I grew to believe this due to the fact that I grew up in the church and am naturally a kind and caring person.  This actually helped me have blind faith in my government and my church.    I have come to change these beliefs recently....  People are still dying in Iraq. People are still dying in Afghanistan. Not to change questions, but why? Why are we still there? Why is there death in the world? Why don't trickle down economics work? Why doesn't communism work? Are republicans the cynics? or the democrats? or is it the growing population of independents?  These are the questions I'm dealing with right now...  Just thought you could use a little update Peace out- Tim

       Happy Halloween   So cahlen and peter went and got a new router last night. So that's cool, real internet for the whole house. YAY.  DAMN LINKSYS!!! NEVER buy one of their damn routers. Ever since we got that shit home it was cutting out every couple of days, until yesterday when it cut out entirely:P  So here we are. It's nate's birthday. I have 2 parties to go to and no costume. I'll feel like a chump, but what can you do? I think I'll be wearing my white and red "Freak" hat, and maybe a shit that says freak somewhere on it. Where as my roommate karla has a full get up.  Today is also, pay bills and get oil changed day. So that's exciting:)  It's been an excellent movie week. In the past 2 days I've watched, Beautiful Girls, Amelie, and As good as it gets. I love the 2 compliments that he gives her in As good as it gets.   I'm driving to pocatello next week to drive cindy back. ROAD TRIP!!! :) YAY!!! Now I just need to make some good mix CDs:)  OK, I'll catch you on the flip side-

       Just a man   Before you judge me... Before you call me a slut... Before you hate me... remember that I am just a man.   I don't know who I am, but I know what I enjoy. time with friends, time reading my books, time spent self improving, these are some of the things I enjoy most. Travel, meeting new friends, watching a well made film, talking, kissing.  Thinking about the un-important things in life. Why are we here? What happens when we die? Is God real? Is there life after death? Is there a soul? Things that can really only be carefully considered after the basic needs are taken care of.  Lively debate with friends in a trusted environment.  These are the things I cherish, these are what make me a man...

       weddings and what not   The wedding last night was nice. It was good to see a bunch of the old gang. I know that I have changed in more ways than they'd like to think about. Sometimes I wonder if I'd rather have a return to innocence.   Anyway, it turns out that my good friend Brian married Amy last month. I was really looking forward to going to their wedding. It makes me sad that we weren't able to get the contact information together so that my invite could show up and I could go to the wedding.   On the plus side, we got to set our clocks back an hour last night. So I got an extra hour of sleep. Kinda:)  Got the new Barenaked Ladies album, and so far my favorite song is 05 - for you.

       When   I've been trying to think of the last time I really fell in love was. I think it was sophomore year of college, to a cute freshman named julie. We read each others poetry. Then I think she kinda fell for me, whcih scared the living piss out of me. So I told her that she should date the boy that had been interested in her when I showed up. Then when he broke her heart, I was the one that took her out so she could grieve. Unfortunately for me, it was too late to have her fall for me. She married this past summer. I need to call her and see about a dinner.  Since that time sophomore year, I think I've hidden my feeling better, made sure I didn't fall for them any more. I think for better or worse, I've had to lose some compassion along the way. It's also caused me to have respect for women in general. Not to say that I should put every woman I meet on a pedistal, but  perhaps I shouldn't be thinking, "How can I get in her pants?"  Although, before I have always not thought about getting into her pants, and that hasn't gotten me anything but a plethura of female friends. Which is good, I like female friends, but I think I'd prefer female lovers:)  All this to say that if you're my friend and you're female, there's a chance I want to get into your pants:) But not because I am in love with you :(  Catch you on the flip side-

       It's 5:30 am   I had a bachelor party that I went to tonight. It was very SPU-ish. i.e. we went to dinner at TGI Fridays cause hooters was too much of a sin for some of the guys. Then we went to a comedy club. That was actually pretty fun.  urlLink Comedy Underground  Then we went to Goldie's, which is a "casino" here in washington. All-in-all it was a VERY mild bachelor party. Cliff drove me around for it, so I drank a little.  Funny thing is, I got home and went to bed 4 hours ago. I just woke up extremely horny like 20 minutes ago and couldn't get back to sleep. I know I need to change something in my lifestyle as I don't want to wait until I've lost my sexual drive before I hook up with a beautiful girl. I'm concerned that I may wake up one morning and not realize that I'm not hoping to have sex someday.  My thing is that there are so many diseases out there now that I'm scared to go to a bar and try to pick up a woman. For one thing, what if it turns out she's a dude? Next there's the whole disease thing to worry about. My main problem I think would be my job. I've heard jobs can be a great place to meet women. That's great, if there's more than 1 woman per 50 men.   So my friends are getting married on saturday. I'm nervous for this marriage. Anyway, maybe I can see some old friends at the wedding and try and get some dates out of it:)  Hope everyone is doing good and much less horny than I am:) Peace out-

       war   A friend sent me this link today:   urlLink http://www.truthout.org/docs_03/102303C.shtml   As part of becoming more of who I am, I share it with you. In and of the fact that I think "war is dumb". And the fact that my friend adam will be in "war torn" iraq in less than 2 weeks.   Sometimes I wonder if I should think at all. It would be so much easier to follow blindly. To stick my head in the ground and say, "I trust our leaders. They know what they're doing". But I can't. I've been in this world long enough to know the bullshit. To see the promise and then have it removed from before me.   Just thought I'd share-

       men and women... again   I would have to argue that men need women more than women need men. I've heard that with long term marriages, when a wife dies the husband will surely die within a year. It's true for johnny cash.  It puzzles me, partly that women do not know the power they hold over us, partly that when they do, they become someone that we do not want to be with. Or is it that some women can use sex as a powerful weapon. Where a man can assault with sex, he can hardly ever manipulate with it. I've known men that would do just about anything to get into a womans pants.   Now I'm babbling, it's 3:30 am and I'm going to sleep.  Peace and love-

       Friends   I just wanted to thank you my friends. You are my chosen family. You are the people I love, even when I hate you for what you say or do. You are the people that define who I am and who I am to become.  You are there when I have my crisis of faith and understand me when I ask you what it would mean if there was no God.  Thank you for not letting me get lonely. And allowing me to be part of your life. Peace out-

       endings and beginnings   Here it is 3am on wednesday morning. Why am I still awake? I should have been asleep hours ago. I wish I could say I was reading or playing the piano. But I've been playing video games. Distractions from the real. From the people we know and love.  Music that is on: Guster - Either way  Sleep? who needs it? I have another post to write after this one. Will I be asleep before 4 tonight? Does it even matter?  Parts of my life are coming to an end, others are beginning to blossom. Relationships change, evolve.  I AM the hurricane that is my life.   Peace-

       understanding   Is it that I am so strange? Are these the thoughts of every man, woman and child? Am I alone in my wonderment? I don't think so...  I think we often all deal with these thoughts. How is that we're so scared of each other? Trust is not easily earned today.   I often ponder if we men have less or more feelings than women. I don't think we can generalize like that. It is more of a personal thing. I know people that are lonely on both sides of the fence. I also know of people that are not feeling much but just living.  I think that in my past I have turned my feelings on and off. I know when I am scared of rejection I can try and turn my feelings off until trust can be earned. At other times I find it hard to breath for as little as pondering holding a girl's hand.  Well I'm outa here-

       trust   Here I am, set almost naked before you. Trusting you. Wanting to be understood.  Quietly fearing that I'll die alone. Unwanted. Untrusted. Knowing in my heart to be a good man. As best a man I can be.  I just got done reading "Speaker of the dead", Orson Scott Card's second Ender Wiggin novel. I say just, but it's been 5 hours since I went to bed at 5 and it is now 10.  I think that maybe I should have more discretion on this little blogger thing. Be more secretive. Not tell you anything. But you're my journal, at least of my thoughts and ideas. A way to quickly go back and remember the days gone by and see where my friends were and to find new friends. I think I partly publiish these knowing that no one will ever see them, but knowing someone will.   This is myself laid bare and I hope you enjoy reading it. If you can understand everything I say in these few pages you'll probably understand me as close as anyone has ever tried. Peace out-

       updates   I realized that I haven't updated you on some rather important things on my life.  Last december I started getting thirsty and would aften end up peeing about 8 times during the night. Cindy made me promise to go see a doctor as I was also losing weight w/o even trying. I promised her that if I ever hit 200 lbs that I would get insurance and go see the doctor. In may I hit 200 lbs (a whole 60 lbs less than I had been in november, and about the weight I was when I entered college) and I went and got health insurance. June 2nd I went to see the doctor. He told me that I had probably diabetes, but he wouldn't rule out cancer. So I pee'd in a cup and came back tuesday morning for my blood work to be drawn.  Friday it was confirmed that I had diabetes. About that time I went on a low/no carb diet. That lasted about 2 weeks. Now I'm on a limited carb diet. A diebetic nurse thinks I'm in my honeymoon period. No one wants to say it, but I'll probably be insulin dependent in the year. That is where you give yourself a shot of insulin before every meal.  I started working out there for a while. That's one way I can control my sugar. My buddy, Cindy, moved to idaho and I lost interest in working out. I forced my bosses to find low carb supplements for when they ordered dinner for our team while I was working. I have come to deal diabetes. When the time comes for insulin shots, I will be ready for that as well.  Now I'm on my break. Cahlen and Karla are moved into our free rooms. (see cindy and sean moving out) Peter and Dan are in love with my friends that I've asked to move in. We had a house party last friday night. It wasn't as rowdy as some of the previous parties, but it was good.  I think you're now mostly all up to date. Signing off as your diabetic friend-

       understanding   Why is it that I have trouble relating to people sometimes? Or maybe not relating, but why are people scared of me? Perhaps it is misconceptions, or maybe I am just a scary person.  What does it mean to be christian? What does it mean to be set apart? Is there something that says that boys and girls can't be friends? Even if there is sexual tension, what about the possibility of giving up on sex for the better good of keeping a friend?  I wish to be a salve that can take pain away and allow wounds to heal, but I cannot, if I am not allowed. Perhaps there is more than just that. I find great comfort in comforting others.  I know that looks matter. And I wish they didn't. I need help in the dressing department, as I don't think I dress myself well. And the female friends I have tend to agree with that.  Well, I gotta run, catch you on the flip side-

       life   What is love? Baby, don't hurt me...  Sometimes my ideas of love swing wildly about and I'm left wondering what I know, or what I think I know.   I asked a girl to be my friend yesterday, but she hasn't responded. I don't know how often she checks her mail, or if it went into a trash bin automatically, or if she's scared I'll turn into a lunatic....  Can men and women just be friends? I enjoyed the ideas presented in "When harry met sally", I think they mostly are true.   I signed up for friendster the other day, but I still need to get pictures up. It seems to me, that no picture = no contacts. After all you could be some hideously ugly freak:)  OK, I'm going to go look for a plug in for a friends website... Peace out-

I know he was looking forward to working till June and they couldn't find work for him through the winter.  Matrix 2 showed up today. So I'm going to watch that with Cliff tomorrow. I can already tell that I'm going to have trouble staying focused on music and cleaning my house and getting a job. Especially since cliff is off:)  C'est la vie...

       Things   It's 1:37 in the morning. All day I've been reading ender's game by Orson Scott Card. I'm 229 pages into it. I should have it finished by morning.  Of the things I know in this life, which aren't many, I know this for sure... I want to find someone to Love and to be fully Loved in return.  That's what I comes down to. I often wonder what I should be doing to find that special someone... What I might do to make someone like me... What happens if I find her and I've already screwed up my life so bad that she doesn't want me?  Why do we have a desire to be accepted? Am I a bad man? Am I a good man?  Adam is going to Iraq on October 31st. This reason enough gives me enough pain/emotion to hate my president. To realize that one of my best friends may die, and there is nothing I can do about it. Who is Saddam Hussein to me? What is Iraq? Why are we there?   I started taking piano lessons. Self improvement or masturbation?  That is all- Tim

       Dreams, unemployment, car accidents and DND   I tried to start to be part of a D&D game last night. We made characters and are meeting next monday to start the quest.  Then...  I had a dream last night. I was having dinner with a bunch of friends. Karla and a boyfriend of hers that I had never seen were also eating with us. Karla was on the table next to us and he was sitting across from me. I was on the bench side and we had two 4-person tables tables pulled together for the gathering. Over the course of the meal, whenever I turned to talk to the table where karla and the friends were sitting, her boyfriend would put stuff in my drink. One time it was a lemon, One time it was fish bones. The second time, I yelled at him to stop messing with my drink. Karla asked me why I was freaking out, and I just yelled that she was trying to poison me. She tried to explain that it was a joke, but I just kept yelling "You're trying to poison me". She started crying and I woke up. After waking up, I recalled every time I have ever let my mother down and then I felt horrible inside.  I've decided that my dream and the D&D are somehow connected and I will not be playing anymore.  I woke up at 7am this morning, for I had a meeting with the unemployment peeps. Just a "Getting a job" class, but I read, so that was fun. I'm finishing up the "Children of the Mind" by Orson Scott Card, book 4 of the ender's series.  Driving back from hanging out with Cliff today, there was a car accident in front of my house. I don't know how it happened. I was thinking about blogging, then I look and see 2 cars spinning in unison in front of me. It was so weird.  Tonight we celebrate cahlens birthday. YAY!!! I got a 160GB HD for my birthday, so that's fun:)  Well, I'm going to go practice the piano now.   Peace-

       Achilles Heel   I'd have to say that my one social problem (achilles heel) would have to be my voice. In everything I attempt to do, my voice is there. My lisp is there. My "funny talking" is there.  I think it makes me come across as stupid. I think it causes some people to take pitty on me, while on others it makes them pissed off if I'm put into a leadership role ahead of them. Other people tend to think that I not know what I'm getting myself into, as if I couldn't understand it.   Sometimes I wonder if I sound like a down syndrome person. I know that women find me completely harmless, not that I mind. I would like a mutual attraction.   No matter where I go I take my achilles heel with me.  It is a constant reminder that no matter how hard I try at something, certain people will never take me seriously, and certain people will hate me. Certain people will try with all their might to protect me, as if I can't deal with something myself.  Do I look in the mirror and see a down syndrome baby?   I hate my speech impediment. Of course it helps when I look up speech impediment on google and it come up with:   urlLink 'Speech impediments may manifest as stutters or lisps or may be more severe. Severe speech impediments are relatively more common among people with cerebral palsy and can be associated with other physical disabilities or deafness. Relatively minor speech impediments may have a basis in a psychological disability or mental illness, but this should not be assumed.'   I guess this should mean that I'm more employable?  Anyway, I should go. I have the piano to practice. Peace-

What is relationship? Trust? commitment? I don't know... I know I appreciate all my friendships and will continue them till my friends have an intervention....  Well, my alarm is going off, I should practice piano for my last 2 hours before piano lessons.  Peace-

       mmm... fish   Sometimes I ask myself "What should I be doing?" Most of the time I just go with the flow though. So, when I do ponder the "what" question, it usually has something to be doing with my real life at the moment.  I've been thinking about the situation that I'm in and about hurting people.  I found out that I'm not hurting someone I thought I was and so that gives me some relief. I know that through no conscience act I've gotten to the point that I can hurt people by not doing anything wrong. Some say that I am the victim and that I'm being preyed upon. That is bullshit. If I'm hurting anyone, or am going to be hurt, I have done so with both eyes open, neither fearing nor blindly following. I have seen what I want. I know what I think I want.  Blogs...  Have I been to honest with you? Will my friends hate me? Will I destroy friendships? Will I leave and not look back? Will I find a happy medium of telling my blog only certain things and then keeping myself hidden?    I once told a girl that I would not ask her out for a number of reasons and she asked me why, and I told her. This of course would be after she had just told me that she was not interested in a dating relationship. After telling her my reasons for doubts, she would not tell me why she would not date me.  She told me it would hurt me too much. I felt betrayed and pissed off. I wondered how I could possibly work on traits that she found to be undate-able, if she would not tell me. I often wonder, if she knew that she pissed me off and that I would rather know, than not know. Or maybe it was that she was shallow? Could it be that she didn't find me attractive? in a physical sense?  Enough philosophy... Updates: Party went well yesterday. i think everyone had a good time, except maybe Dan who was trying to sleep. I went and found Cindy an apartment today. She's moving to Ballard in December. Dinner was at anthonys. I had some salmon and halibut. It was SO delicious.  Anyway, I need to practice my piano before I screw up royally tomorrow.  I'll catch you later-

       Humoungously busy   So...  I hate the feeling that you're letting EVERYONE down. Today, I was too impatient with Dan and I didn't set aside enough time for Peter.  These two things were at perpendicular to each other, and were unavoidable. I was supposed to play football with Peter, Dan said that Peter wasn't going to be home till 4, so I should go to lunch with him. Well, since Peter would be gone till 4pm I did go to lunch. But then he wanted to go to Target for a quick shop. Long story short, we get home at 3pm. Nate is coming over for beer at Teddys and to go to best buy. Lunch was at 11:30, I should have been fine, even when peter came home at 1, I should have been fine, but that DAMN target trip. Dan's pissed at me for being impatient, I'm pissed at Dan for making me miss time with Peter, and Peter's pissed because I didn't make him the priority.  This IS a GREAT party atmosphere. I think I've fucked up another friendship and I feel like I'm about as comforting as a hurricane. I try and be the best man I can be, and I think people are still getting hurt.   And now I think I may have found some work. We'll see. Anyway, Master and Commander was great, and City of Lost children was awesome in that way that Amelie was awesome. Hopefully, I'll see you all tomorrow.  Peace-

       ugh   Life is beautiful. It's pay day today. So that's exciting. I came to a realization last night. I've been creating a computer for about the last 6 months. I've gotten hard drives, a sound card, a DVD+-RW, and a case. All that's left is Mobo, CPU, RAM and a video card. I can't pull the trigger, and I don't really care right now. I'd much rather spend the 500 bucks on friends and good times than on a computer I don't need. I was playing games last night and realized that I was enjoying myself. If I can enjoy my games without upgrading and spending the extra dough, then why should I?  So I'll be upgrading my fashion sense instead. I have never spent much money on the packaging of Tim. I will now be buying a new wardrobe to go with the new slender Tim. Well, I need to go deposit the paycheck.   Catch you later-

       damn blogger and office   So I had this blog all written out and went to check on something in office. Anyway, office sent me to a website and killed my blog.  I was just thinking about how we are unable to go through life without hurting someone. I have never purposefully tried to hurt someone and I think I may have gotten into a situation where someone is going to get hurt. I wish I could find a way out where everyone involved could happy and not hurt. But I can't see the way. I'm trying to get to a much more flexible life, where I'm not planning things out 2 - 3 weeks in advance, but things keep on filling up.  It's my birthday.  Today we're going to ballard bar and grill. The matrix. and Tony Romas. Tomorrow is dinner and anime with Jarred. Thursday is dinner with Cindy. Saturday is party at my hizouse for Cahlen, karla and my birthdays. Should be a good time.  OK, I'm going to burgers now. Check yous later-

       women 2.0   as you all know, generalizations do not hold true to every person. If you happen to be a woman reading this blog and it doesn't pertain to you. Then know that you are unique, at least in what I've come to understand women. And if we are friends then it is probably true that you do not date mostly jerks as I don't like to associate myself with such women, nor do I have friends that are jerks, so they tend not to attract said women.   I'm leaving for idaho in 7.5 hours. I'll catch you guys later. Peace-

       what we really want   I was thinking about wants today. Thinking about the feeling of wanting to be accepted and how different people play that out as different roles.  Sometimes I wish I had it all figured out. What I really want, what would fulfill my life and make me the man I want to be. But then I realize that's what everyone wants. A clear path where all the choice were already made and you just had to follow the steps correctly.  But then there would be no fun. Well, I need to pack. I'm headed to idaho to bring Cindy back to Seattle tomorrow and am waking at 5am so I can get there in 1 day.  Peace-

So I have Bach, minuet in G that I'm practicing for my piece right now.  Tonight I'm going to costco to find a new piano with weighted keys. Hopefully it won't be too expensive.

       what I've learned about women   This is something I've been thinking about, and which I may be totally wrong, but I wanted to share it with you.  From what I can tell, women want power and comfort. They often tell me that they want a man that will hold them and cuddle, but often end up with jerks. I've often considered this very ironic and have been perplexed by my other sensitive brothers. We have often commented that the girls always go for the jerks and I think I have a theory why. I think that they see these men as the future leaders of our society at least subconsciencely. Women are drawn to ambitious men. I've often heard them say that they would be with a man who knows what he wants.   I tell you that any man worth reproducing with, will not be so closed minded as only seeing a single future within his life. He will not expect to be the next president of the united states. He will not put down his fellow man in order for his own gain.  The women see that the jerk is a jerk from the get out. But they don't see a jerk. They see a man with ambition. A man that won't let another man get in his way, and he wants to be with her. Well why shouldn't she be with him. If he becomes rich and powerful, why not be there with him.  I've often been perplexed by young girls dreams of being a princess or a long lost relative of some rich and powerful person. I've never understood why they would want to give up their family for the power of a title. I think it has to do with society placing beauty before wisdom. Women see the princess as always getting her way, their way.  Sometimes I wish this were a discussion instead of a "post", or that I'd at least be able to communicate with you. I'm going to try and get a comments board up, but am having trouble finding one. Peace out-

       Mortality   I've been reading Xenocide, by Orson Scott Card, tonight. I was planning on going to bed around 10ish. Well, that didn't seem to work:)  Some of the ideas and characters presented in these books are very emotionally straining on me for some reason. I often wonder how I can tear up at a stupid story. I've always been impressed by peoples abilities to pull on heart strings through meer words and stories.  I am continually being challenged by my own mortality. I was thinking about how I'm turning 26 in one week. I often ponder who I may have affected in the first 26 years of my life that would care if I were here or not. Of course, then I start to think of the people that I love.  The people that have affected me in such a way that I would truly mourn their passing into whatever may be after death. (Don't even get me started on life after death as this has become a serious question of my faith recently)  How is it that we get to be where we are and not continually try to be with the ones we love. I have such emotional controll over my life that I can sit here now and talk about these things with you, that I may never have to bring them up with the people that I trully care about. Sometimes I wish I were more in touch with my feelings that I could just do stuff without thinking of consequences. Or maybe I don't think of consequences correctly and so I don't allow my emotional to help me decide things. Overall I think I have a rather boring life. Won't someone help me?   Sometimes I wish I could not have self doubt and/or fear of rejection. I often wonder if I could live by some of the advice I give or if it's all just a lie.  A man described me as a punk thinker last night. i.e. punk because of my blue hair, and thinker because of my glasses. I think that maybe I'm just trying to get new experiences. Do I not shave my beard because I think it might make me more attractive to the women I want to meet? or do I not shave my beard because I'm lazy?  What do I want? I know that I need to find someone who won't judge me for my online journal. I am looking for what everyone is looking for. Someone who can accept me for who I am, even when I'm trying to be cute and humorous and it comes out as disgusting and inappropriate. Someone who I don't have sexually repulsive:) All other points can be discussed-

       Life or something like it... and part of me   I have fully regressed to quiet introspective Tim. At times I will be outrageous party Tim, and at other times I'll be quiet introspective Tim. It's a cycle. Ups and downs. I first heard the idea of our selfs as cycles in Highschool, from a man I trully respect and value the opinion of.  So I'm introspective Tim today. Unfortunately I have the little motivation to leave the hizouse these days. Which means my friends are missing me:(  Piano lessons are going great. I'm going to get my book of jewels songs on piano. So that's exciting. I'm going to idaho on wednesday to drive Cindy and bubba fett back to seattle.  So that's something. I got the new outkast, ludacris, and Meat loaf on CD from bestbuy today. Went to the JCPenny and got flannel sheets.  It is officially freezing in washington. It snowed this morning around 8am for about half an hour. I was asleep, of course, but I heard about it.   There was a birthday party last night. I didn't bring a present:( and I didn't give a present.  I did promote our party on the 15th, but that's not saying much.  I need a piano or at least a weighted keyboard to practice on:( so much to spend my money on. So little money.   Part of me wants to be a contributing part of society, part of me just wants to sit back and make snide remarks. Part of me wants a girlfriend so bad. Part of me wants someone to fuck. Part of me cares so much. Part of me doesn't care at all. Part of me wants a "nice" girl. Part of me wants a girl to tell me how to please her. Part of me wants to be good with the ladies. Part of me wants the ladies to see what's good in me and want to have that.  Part of me feels like Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation. Part of me feels like Barry Egan in Punch-drunk love.  That is enough for now... Back to Xenocide by Orson Scott Card. Peace-

       Revolutions   Can it be that I am not fired up or passionate about any discrepancies that I see? Should I drop everything and change my life? Move away and become a hard worker that has a passion for life? Am I merely asleep at the wheel? Am I dead?  Sometimes I wish I had a revolution I could be taking part in. Maybe there is an evil tyrannical man oppressing people somewhere that I could be fighting against. Is there a way I can divert my energy to help people? Instead of sleeping my days away in tired America?  Am I too fearful to be passionate? Am I too drowned in debt to try?

       true obsession   do you know that feeling?...  Should I call? Does she like me? Do I like her? Am I playing the game forrectly? Am I suffocating her? Am I enough for her? Am I doing the right thing? Am I just fooling myself until she finds out she doesn't want me? Do I want her? Should I ask her out? Will she say yes? Do I want her to say yes? Should I continue looking? Do I want/need to continue looking? Is there such a thing as a good ending? Who am I? Where am I? What should I be doing? What do I want to do?   Inner strugglings... peace- Tim

       Life is beautiful and so are you   Well, it's been a while. I decided against remaining in the D&D game. Life is good. Christmas is almost here. I've decided I'm going back to Oregon on tuesday and will be back up here on friday.  I just finished "The Tao of Pooh" which talks about Tao-ism and how the characters in Winnie the pooh relate to Taoism. It was very enlightening. Tao-ism seems to be a very go with the flow of life idea, which is what I like about it.  Anyway, I went to Trillogy tuesday (all the Lord of the rings shows on tuesday december 16th.) It was pretty good, and I feel like i got my nerd-ness fill for the rest of the year:)  Well, gotta run, Peace- Tim

       Nothing to say?   So I have 3 days of vacation left. I'm falling behind on my piano work. I want to be an excellent piano player, but it's hard to find the time sometimes. (also hard to make it a priority when you're trying to get through a difficult piece)  Anyway, the problem with match.com is that you have to pay to use it. You don't have to pay to put up a profile you just have to pay to email. Of course I'm not sure I'm in a get to know new people part of my life yet. But there's never time like the present.  While I'm writing this, I'm listening to  urlLink Brak tell it like it is .  Work starts in 3 days. So much to do, so little time. should I shave before I go back? Should I pay for match.com or move on to a different service? Should I go into hibernation while I work for a while?  Maybe I should just listen to some nice tunes and smoke a bowl:) Peace-

       The "am I a good person?" question   I had a friend ask me if I thought they were a good person. Of course I said yes, but couldn't offer any substantial proof.  I think the question is more relative than anything. Am I good compared to the next person? Or am I good compared to Charles Manson? Or am I good compared to Jesus Christ of Nazareth?  I think before you ask if you're a good person, you need to decide what you're shooting for. Am I good compared to ghandi? Probably not?  Being a good person is a daily struggle. You take 1 thing that makes you a good person and I could maybe point out 1 thing that makes you a bad person. There are no good/bad people. There are just people.  If you aren't a child molester/rapist/alcoholic/non-motivated/drug addict/constant complainer/murderer/stealing candy from babies person then you're pretty damn good in my book. If people aren't constantly leaving the room when you enter, then you probably have friends somewhere:)  Be content to know that you are loved beyond your ability to comprehend. And love your neighbor as yourself.

       piano & competition   I think that on some level all people want to have a boyfriend/girlfriend that is sought after by others. At least I think attraction partially works due to outside influence. I saw a movie, Iris, where the heroine chose the nerdy guy, I think as a safe bet, partially because she had already had the wild lifestyle she wanted. So that movie actually goes against what I just said, but I think that it is due to the fact that having a greatly desired mate by others is not the only reason people hook up. I think sometimes people get together because they are lonely awnd find someone they can connect with on a deeply spiritual and emotional level, and mutual attraction helps.  I blog and match.com, and take my female friends out to coffee. Not such a bad way to live.   Well, I need to get ready for my piano lesson. I'll check you guys on the flip side, Peace-

       I slip on it everytime   Here I am. I have 10 days of freedom before going back to "the daily grind" which isn't really a grind at all, but it's still work.  So I signed up on match.com the other day. My profile is shyguy1177. In case anyone was interested in looking at it. When I was testing out some of the features I accidentally sent a "wink" which says that you're interested in meeting someone. It was just the person at the top of my list. Turns out she has kids living at home. It was a little awkward, me telling some total stranger mom that I liked her. I think if I were testing match.com, I'd have them put in a confirmation or something.  Well, I'm off to see the dr. today. Evidentally diabetics' eyes have a tendency to go bad, so I need to go see an eye dr. I hope my new glucometer comes soon.  Anyway, enough of my randomness. I'm going to go shower now.

       personalities   I will never know some people. I will never understand other people. I had a friend, Justin. His personality was semi-cruel. I think that's part of it. I don't understand cruel people. But the real question, I guess, is "Do I understand myself?"  I have been given a disease that will eventually destroy my body. I've inherited it from my father. I will pass it on to my children. My base root self needs to procreate and I would like to have an heir. I've watched my father disintegrate before my eyes. He will die like Johnny Cash, but hopefully not to soon.  I wish I had a love of my life. I am a HOPELESS romantic. I know I could be a good lover. Now all I need to do, is invest a little more time in a lady's life.  Well, I'm off to Oregon, Peace-

       vivacity   Am I living in teenage angst? Who am I? Have I managed to live myself into a hole? Am I the only one who can find my way out?  I met this girl. She's really cute, and awesome to be around. Unfortunately, she has to go away. She inspires me to be more than I am. When I think about her, it makes me want to be a better man. It makes me feel like I've been floating with the current and nothing has challenged me in a long time, nor have I challenged myself.  What do all people want? To fall in love with someone, and have that person fall in love with them. Unfortunately then the inevitable happens. Life doesn't end or stand still, it just gets annoying. You never see the "13 years later" in the movies. He's devoted himself to a job that he hates because they have a house they can't afford and she's banging the milk man, since he's at the house more often than her husband. I believe the reason that Romeo & Juliet is such a great love story is because they don't live long enough to fall out of love.  My ideal candidate for girlfriend: able to travel up for anything cute not hampered by prejudice not hampered by fear  Am I cynical, a realist, or a dreamer? I think a bit of all of these things rolled into a complex little mammal that wishes to procreate:)  Today I write to the blackhole of the internet, not knowing if anyone is reading...  If you're out there and you're reading this, please email me and tell me hi... peace-

       Scorpios and the like   I wish I didn't have to turn off my heart. I wish I could be loving and supportive and not jealous. I wish I was on a similar life journey. I wish I weren't just starting out. I wish I could trust myself to not have an irrational jealousy. I wish I could say, goodluck, I want to hear all the details. I want you to be happy no matter what. I wish I could say, Oh he sounds like quite a catch and not hate him with every fiber of my being. I wish I could stay close intimate friends. I know that my love lasts forever. At least I know it's lasted since 13, and I am prepared to carry love in my heart for another 100 + years of my life.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss my friends deeply. We are spread out by jealousy and a few oceans. I was asked what I would do if I can do anything I was tonight, no penalties, no reprisals, and the cost is unimportant. What would I do? My answer was the I would call ALL my friends (past & present) and schedule a party at a local restaurant. We would have dinner and chat. I would make sure they knew they could bring their friends and I would make new friends and be able to catch up with all my old friends.  Trully, that is what I dream that heaven would be like. Hanging with all the people I've been friends with and just talking and telling stories. Course my life goal is to have people say that I was a good man and a good friend, a good father and an excellent husband. But maybe I'll never know about that. All I can do is be the best man I know how to be, and that means hurting sometimes.  Well, I should go to bed and/or practice the piano. Oh, and I got new glasses. Peace-

       all about me   So I've been reading through my posts and I began to think what a pathetic guy I must seem like. I can't even handle being alone with myself. It seems to me, I need to spend some time alone. Or at most, just hanging out with guys not even thinking about girls. That would seem like the only logical thing to do, especially if I don't want a rebound relationship. I think it would be best to heal. I mean honestly, I feel as though I should be alone for a while. I don't want to be one of those people that NEEDS to be in a relationship. I want to be the kind of person that if a relationship comes along I can be like, sure, but not strangle it.   It's like I would really like to be in love with somebody, but I don't want to just be in love with anybody. Does that make any sense? AKA, I would like to have someone to love, but it DOES make a difference on who that person is. I'm not just going to want to be in a relationship with any ol' girl. I think the healing process requires lots of piano and video games. Maybe even throwing myself into my work for a while.  Well, I'm off to practice the piano.  Peace-

       overall   I'm glad to have been in the relationship. She is someone I will forever cherish. Now I need to figure out a way to move it to a friendship. I need to not freak out and not be in love and not rebound.Is there a genie out there that can give me a "no feeling" pill? or a "stop liking that way" pill? Well, it looks like I need to order another test kit from the insurance company. I'm going to bed. Peace-

       on relationships and women   So here I am basically coming out of my first serious relationship ever. Overall, I'm glad I had it and am still great friends with the girl. Turning off love is hard though. As a Scorpio, I often get jealous over future boyfriends which is ridiculous. I think mostly I am sad that I cannot be with her anymore. I won't be able to enjoy the journey anymore. I feel like I'm getting left behind. But even as I write that, I think of how I have my own journey to take up.  I'm a bit torn. I don't want to give her up, but I also want to move on and start up the next relationship. Mainly I want to fill up the hole in my heart. But I don't want to just have a girlfriend that is a patch. No rebounds. I don't want a rebound. I just want an open honest relationship with no baggage.  Then there's the point of, is she easily replaceable? Hell NO! But is there a salve that won't hurt anyone? No. There's the life of the monk, but then she'll feel guilty. There's the life of the party-er, but then I and she will only despise me as a slut. (*would it be easier if I were secretly a jerk that only cared about 1 thing?*)  Anyway, I wish God hadn't made women so irresistible :) But I'm glad he did. I'm going to leave you on an up note today, while I try and sleep earlier tonight.  So check out this link which is a hilarious account of the  urlLink End of the world .

They did a CAT scan early this morning and found that the original bleeding point in Heather's brain was shrinking down to normal size.  The latest bleeding point is still large but the doctor is truly amazed that Heather has responded to the heprin so quickly and  the results are better than he could have hoped.  Heather remains in ICU and treatment continues."  Thank you for your continued prayers and support.  Peace-

       Emotional Rollercoaster of nothingness   Well, the latest news being that...   "The doctors ordered an angiogram of my stepsister's brain and it revealed several clots. They are starting a regime of heprin (an anticoagulant) and will continue for the next 6 weeks if she continues to live.  If things are still working out at the end of that time, they will continue the anticoagulant for another 6 months and, hopefully, the clots will dissolve."  That being said, I'm on a bit of an emotional roller coaster right now. I don't know how I feel about my step-sister, except I know I don't want her to die. It's been an emotional week besides that, I've had to give up one of my closest friends and that hurt.    Work is work, and it does a good job of distracting me during the day.  I hope all is well in your life-

       Personalities, one more time   So it seems to me that I appear to be an  urlLink INFJ or Introverted INtuitive Feeling Judging personality .  It seems to be that I am that person. I feel and judge and seem cold and uncaring.  "Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact"  Sometimes, I get overwhelmed by the beauty of the world and I retreat.

       relationships that last forever   So, I have some friend leaving for Vancouver in August. I was recently asked if I'd miss them, and at the moment I was a bit indifferent. Not that I won't miss them horribly, but we're only a phone call or an instant message or email away. In a society of instant messages, cell phones, and email, it's difficult to feel that someone has moved away.  I will never turn down a friend. NEVER. I'm not the type of person that would let down a friend. If something is within my ability to do for a friend I will do it.  On another note, There's a FUCKIN FLY IN MY ROOM!!! It's like 50 degrees out, and there's a fly in my room! WTF!!!!  Anyway, my heart is big enough for all of you. Let me in, let me care and you will never need to wonder if I care. I do, I will, I am. I cannot change who I am, or can I?  Time for bed, Time for work, Peace-

I am going in early tomorrow so I can take off early for my weekend away.  I wonder if it's time for something new. I'm a wee bit tired, so I'm going to go to bed soon. Thus my scatter brain post. Anyway, I just wanted to make a note that we all wanted to see janet jacksons boobs and fuck those prude assholes for suing everyone. It's a fuckin boob. Half the population has em.

       You can't handle the truth   Here it is, approx. 11 hours before I start my new job and I'm kinda nervous, kinda excited, kinda confused, kinda feel like I should have practiced my piano more this week.  Here's a question... how long before you know someone, do you tell them about your blog? I mean obviously there are people you can never tell. (*mothers/pastors/children*)  Should you let your friends know your personal thoughts? You online diary?   Should you hide it and not let anyone else know? Should you be up front about it, and let them decide if you are worthy of being a good friend by giving them a full picture? Or do you let them only see who you are now?   People change. Obviously. But I AM still the man who thinks that cahlen should have said  urlLink fuck   Wow, my history in a nutshell... put on display for the whole world to read. My friends don't write here anymore. But, I'm not really surprised. We've all moved on, basically.  I'm living in an entirely new house, but Cahlen is living downstairs now. Some people that have blogged here, I don't even know anymore.  I'm sure as my life moves on... this, too, shall pass.  Perhaps I will fall madly in love with someone. Maybe falling madly in love only happens in the movies. :)  We'll see, I'll try and keep you posted as the adventure continues... Peace-

       'in love' vs 'love'   Trying to move from 'in love' to 'love' is always an interesting experience. Trying to kill the jealous scorpio is tough too. A friend described someone as an emotional basketcase, was/is that me? Is that a valid description of me.  Growing and learning to move from 'in love' to 'love'. I need to be able to love a person that I was in love with, without being hurt. I need to not harden my heart. I need to remain emotionally vulnerable and allow myself to grow.

       changing   Looking at the last weeks worth of entries, it's very interesting to see who I am now, to the person I was 1 week ago tonight. I definitely seem more emotionally stable right now. Meeting new people helps. Going out at night helps too. Throwing myself into my work helps. Dealing with my feelings helps too.  Well, I need to sleep... Peace- Tim

       lookin to chill   Hey all- Is it so hard to just chill? I'm looking for someone to just chill and relax with. It seems that most people I know are just looking for the next thing, they don't want to slow down and enjoy the ride. I'm looking to get out of the house, but I want some people that want to get out of the house too. Life's too short to watch TV:) If you're free give me a call and we'll chill...  Peace- Tim

       Life as an MMORPG   The idea being that you are who you represent you are. You can represent yourself as anything. You can fool anyone into believing whatever you want them to believe, because it's all not real. You are the only one who knows the real you, and you can hide that information forever. You can bluff anything. You can't know anything. We play videogames, but we do seem to be just our brains, and they're just playing who we are as people./  It's not a world I want to live in. I want to be who I am and present myself as me. I don't want to have to fake who I am. I don't want to appear to change me to better represent a compatible person. I do want to be the best me I can be and present that in the most honest person that I am.  Just some thoughts on me- Tim

       growing pains   So I am standing on my feet now. Walking away from the relationship. "Growing up", if you will. I don't know why I became so needy at the end and I would like to think that I've grown.   It seems right now that I will always love you, but I'm sure that is changing right now, even as I write this.   I am not looking to get back into a relationship right now, but I am looking for some new people to hang out with.   I hope that we can remain friends after this, but I know right now that I don't want to be without you, so that is what I must do.  Peace, Tim

       no seriously   Moving on sucks. It's like I want to be able to say, you can't hurt me any more. But I also want to try to stay caring and there for when she might need you.  Anyway, time to get a jump start on moving on...

       the walled up side   There is me as my asshole self. The one that wants to be in this state of uncaring. The one that just wants to say, "FUCK YOU" and run away. Both of me exist in this one body.  Now to move on to not caring. Fuck allowing myself to be constantly hurt. Time to move on. Time to hide the caring sensitive side and present the uncaring asshole that protects me.

       Who am I, Who I am...   I am an INFJ to the deepest meaning of the word it seems. I will keep you all at arms length. Will you know who I am, besides who I show you? Will I let you see the little boy that will do anything to protect himself from being hurt? No, probably not. There are a million walls to my heart and I can only show you part of it at any one time.  Love to me is letting her in. Caring to the point of being utterly destroyed when she dies. Finding a life worth loving and doing everything within my power to love that woman. I will let her see who I am and hope that she can love me for that and will trust her completely to be gentle. Finding a life worth loving and doing everything imaginable to maintain that love.  Moving back from love is where I exist in daily life. There are the walls and the disappointment when the person dies, but no personal suffering. Protection from the caring. Protection from the guilt of not being able to give people money to get back on their feet. Protection from the guilt of not being able to care for the most basic of human needs of those in need. Numbness in all that is my life. Approaching on the ability to feel nothing, thus destroying any happiness and any pain.  Removing people from my heart is ALWAYS painful. I have found only 1 way. Remove them from my life. Move the walls back in place in my heart. It doesn't work though. I can think of no girl that actually found my love that I have truly been able to remove. My being longs for them to say they love me. To come to me and see the man I will be and love me for that. I long for acceptance with all my being and have never removed a girl from my heart that I have loved.   Unfortunately, to date, that means that every girl I have ever loved has been removed from my life, indefinitely. If we hang out, it is never in the capacity that I will allow myself to be seen, not in the capacity that they have known me.  I hide behind the walls, because I am truly a little boy that cares beyond my ability and am hurt immeasurably by the smallest pin prick. I'm sensitive, be careful with me, because I'd like to stay that way. I know it makes me a pussy and undesirable by any woman looking for strong offspring, but it is who I am with all my flaws, and it may be the only Tim that I will ever be.

       Unsatisfied   Good afternoon...  I am feeling a little underused, underappreciated, and undersatisfied right now. I should request a meeting to make sure that I'm doing what I should be doing and making sure I am doing an ok job at work. I should have a lobotomy so I can quit desiring, so I can be fully satisfied all the time.   Anyway, gotta run, Tim

We didn't receive our mail saying our time was approved, but the website says we are. If I don't have my money by noon today, I'll be making some phone calls ;)  Anyway, I hope the world is a better place today. I went out and shot pool with Joe last night and today I'm doing a weird work schedule so I can get our of here early. I almost made a live internet video at this  urlLink link here .

I would love some help if there's anyone that reads this and would consider doing a group blog with me, let me know and we can start some discussions. No subject will ever be taboo, except of course the issue that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or american heritage as a negative is, I collect your f*ckin head. Just like this f*cker here.  Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE F*CKIN TIME!!!  ok, what? Oh sorry a little Oren Ishii quote for you, but please, let's discuss, I have a variety of friends, I'm sure we got some discussing to do.  Let me know- Tim

       much better   Here I am sunday night. It surprises me the affect that a good conversation can have. I am chipper and am looking forward to the week almost. I have an upbeatness that can last for a while longer as far as I am concerned. I enjoy being in a good to complacent mood so much more than I like being in a depressed state. Well, gotta run.

       what is love?   It is a feeling. It is a touch. It is trust. It is knowing someone well enough that you should walk away in disgust, but don't. Is it something you grow into? Or something that has to just happen... Can you turn love on and off? Is there a switch that says I could love this person or no?  What about growing pains? Are there things to learn from the growing pains? Is there a magic key for becoming the right person? Or are all relationships a work in progress, a commitment to find equal ground? When love fails what is left? A friend, a past love? Do you press on or call it quits? Is there a silver lining?  I'm going to bed, I have work tomorrow, Peace- Tim

       OT and the life that's passing by   Here I am. Working 11 hour days, well at least one. I want no personal debt to speak of, but I have it in large quantities. So now I must work the mad hours and pay it down. Goal: remove credit cards from my life, be able to go where I want, when I want.  So how are you today? I am a bit sleepy, but woke up at 7am almost on the dot. Of course I woke up because I was horny as all hell, but what can you do? Good dreams though.  Here I am again, blogging, writing my diary for the world to see. Peter and I, and whoever else at the house that wants to, are going to the new restaurant/bar 1.5 blocks from the house tonight. So that should be fun.  Well, off to play some video games... err... TEST some video games... yeah, honestly I can't complain, Peace out- Tim

       jealousy   I am so jealous of one of my friends. She has no personal debt to speak of and has a job that she can take vacation days from. I work in an industry that promotes personal debt and punishes for sick days.   Things Tim needs to do: 1) Expand my circle of friends. I need a support network in place for life's little tragedys. I have a good circle right now, I just need to diversify 2) Get out of personal debt. From now till my credit cards are paid off, I will buy no more video games, TVs, DVD players, sound systems. I will spend all my extra money trying to pay off my credit cards. I can go see 1 movie in the theater a week, but that is it. 3) give my old clothes to good will or another thrift shop. Time for some spring cleaning.  Question: Is it childish to love someone that doesn't love you back? Do you just delay the pain and/or prolong it?  Peace-

That is a weird site.  Woke up at the crack of 6:48 with my biological clock a ringin'. Silly body, waking up early is for people that work early. Not the rest of us who have to be at work by 9:30.  Anyway, it's 9:30 so I'm werkin- Peace

       missing her   inside there is a hole where you used to rest, I would long for you and you would come and fill the hole, but now I long and you do not come, you can't come close so the hole can close, and my mind tell's me it's for the best,  but my heart still hurts and it wants you, it says she'll fit perfectly, she'll take you away, she'll stop the pain, but it can't be, and i can't tell my heart that it'll be better, it won't hear it, my heart wants you and hurts me that I'm letting go, It says remember her and don't let her go, fight, tell her how much it hurts, but i can't convey that, i don't want to hurt you,  i just want you back, but since i can't have that, i want you to be happy,  in my cowardly way, I post this to the internet, and those who know can read it, and hopefully it can heal, but sometimes I wonder if it won't just hurt people, I am so sorry, my heart hurts and I need to write it down before i can let it go, I am sorry  tearfully-

       So what now?   Hey Everybody, ok, I only have 1 confirmed reader, but still I like to include everyone, just in case someone stumbles upon my site by accident. (It happened 1 time, it could happen again) Props to Racheal for finding it:)  My life has been changing and staying the same all together. My Piano lessons are going great. I am proving to be a record breaking student. Everything except my project piece is coming along. The project piece should be done by next week. So that's cool.  I'm still torn by my love for my ex girlfriend and wanting to move on. Maybe this is one of those growing pains they were talking about. Maybe this is throwing yourself at something so you don't have to deal with the emotional side of things? Maybe this is I have extra money now, so I should buy myself something nice that will help make me feel something?  Well, thus ends another uplifting post to the blog... Peace-

       The stuff that sucks   Losing a loved one, via relocation or death. Losing a friend over a disagreement. Losing a friend due to personal feelings. Losing a love due to circumstances beyond your control.  Moving to a new city. Removing yourself from a situation that makes you hurt because you care about someone. Becoming strangers. The new make over show, the swan.   Stuff that is good   Rekindling a friendship lost in time. Moving to a new city. Rekindling a love that was lost, but is now found. Meeting new friends. Dining out. Walks around greenlake. Having my health and beauty. Singing in the shower. Whistling a happy tune. Learning to play the piano. Going out with friends.  kissing. cuddling.  peace out- Timatao

       Passion   I wish I were more passionate about things in my life. It seems that people are often upset by something they are passionate about and can influence others to become passionate about it as well. I have some empathy, but I think that when it comes to ideas that don't really affect me, I can't really become passionate about it. I think I am an apathetic person living in an apethetic society.

      I know I tend to overthink almost everything in my life.  Today I was thinking about which is better, to underthink or to overthink everything. As an overthinker, I tend to think that is good, but there's also a point when you need to stop thinking and start doing.  However, I do like to live spontaneously, whenever possible, and try not o read too much into anything. Also, sometimes I prefer NOT to overthink something. Thinking can become tiresome.

      I try to understand, to contemplate, to see through the darkness, to see the light, to see the fright, I want to see what is to come, to know who to be, to know where to go, to live life like there's no tomorrow, to see what cannot be seen, to touch that which is withheld, to see potential in everyone, to know the people of my life.  I am here, lost in my sea of uncertainty, no knowing left from right or up from down. Everywhere I look I see gray where there was once black, I see gray where there was once white. I know there are things to do for free, but this is where my muse leaves and takes the ideas with her...   So I ask my friends, there are some good ideas, the problem mostly being that everything costs money. There is ALWAYS gas involved, and gas costs money. Sometimes there is beer involved, and beer costs money.  How do you start seeing someone else when you still have feelings for another? I've heard that feelings for the other will never really leave though...  Well, I'm off- Tim

      I've often wondered why more people don't blog. and have had this answered in many a different way. I think my job/personality are in a unique place where I have time to blog and it fulfills part of my need to socialize. Blogging gives me a way to get my random thoughts of Tim out of my head and onto the internet. I use my blog as a way to socialize with my friends, especially when the job takes up more than it's fair share of my time. I think if I went out more and wasn't sitting in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day, then I probably would not blog as much.  I don't know. Sometimes I feel like a blogger, sometimes I don't. Maybe this was that muse I was talking about?  Peace- T

      It's too bad we only have but one life to live. It seems that it would be nice to experience life at all the different "beautiful" levels.  I mean they all suck in their own little ways: Beautiful people are always being hit upon by everyone. So they become more and more jaded by the people they know, especially if they date other very attractive people. It seems that most un-attractive people would date attractive people and love them, but an attractive person would become attracted to someone that is not attracted to them, thus creating an interest in why that person isn't interested in them. The attractive people will often find themselves in unhealthy relationships due to their constantly falling in love with people that aren't attracted to them.   For un-attractive people, or even socially challenged people there's can be a more worthwhile struggle: Instead of having to fend off suitors, they must deal with the constant barrage of rejection. They must constantly bring themselves back from the rejection and try and try again. They more easily learn that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that they ust be willing to compromise for love. They struggle everyday with either trying to find love, or maybe giving up and trying to find other things to fill that void. (See video games)  The cute people I think have the best and worst of both worlds. The arrogant beautiful people not giving them the time of day, and rejecting them. The non-attractive psychos stalking them. And their want to find someone attracted to them, that they too are attracted to.  In the Te of Piglet, I read that a man had 2 wives, a plain one and a beautiful one. The story goes that a traveller came and stayed with the man and by the next day came to realize that the beautiful wife was left ignored, while the plain one was treated with honor and affection. When the traveller asked the boy of the household why. He replied "The beautiful one knows that she is beautiful; the plain one knows that she is plain." The moral being to put away your pride and act upon your Virtue.  I don't know if I'm explaining this very well as I'm trying to form my opinions based off what I'm reading right now, but I think the gist is explained. And in case you were wondering, yes, I am cute :)  Lost but in peace- Tim

      I went out to an puget sound waterfront house on saturday night. We drank and ate and played scattergories. Sunday was spent lounging at Seattle Center watching the kids run around in the fountain. It was a really nice and relaxing time. I wrote some in my journal but basically chilled with new and old friends all weekend. It was suprisingly relaxing and easy going. I was supposed to see "Super size me" yesterday, but I wanted to hang at the seattle center instead. I'll see it someday, in the mean time, I'll keep eating at McDonalds :)  Peace- T

      I'm at work this week. I don't know what I feel anymore. I can't tell who I am, or who I want to be. I know that I am ok with that. I know that I will be fine and don't need to know anything.  I met some really cool people this weekend. So that's nice.  floating- Tim

      I think that I would not like to be a woman. I mean, it seems to me, that women, at least the ones I know, always have ex-boyfriends that won't fall out of love with them. I've always thought that women would be the ones that would fall in love more often, but it seems that my circle of friends is the exactly opposite. I've found that it's mostly girls that would rather not be under the commitments of a relationship.=, where most men I know would rather be in a committed relationship than a string of one night stands.   It seems that I read a book recently, Tao of Pooh or Te of piglet? Where the author was explaining how women are no longer treated like ladies because the womens rights movement sought to do away with any mistreatment of women. I don't know why I mention it, but it seems that women are more like the men of yesteryear, and men are the sensitive guys that women always said they wanted, but didn't really.  I'm sitting here lost in a sea of uncertainty- Tim

      I HAVE been trying to not have these feelings for my ex. I know that I need to move on. It's not like I can choose to fall out of love, just as much as she can choose to fall in love.  But I AM trying. I know sometimes it seems like we're back at square 1. Sometimes I think I have left my feelings for her in the past.  I do want to find someone who will fall in love with me, but I'm having trouble. I think I don't have time for a relationship right now. I just need to make my priorities.  Anyway, I wanted to let everyone know that I AM trying.  Peace- T

      So I just had this thought. Maybe the Puritans were all scorpios that were all just jealous of being scorned, so they decided sex was bad. I think I lucked out by being more liberal even though I AM a scorpio.  I dunno, I could see how people that were really jealous, could just make a blanket statement that nudity is bad. I have no idea what I'm talking about.  Peace- T

       maybe I was wrong   Maybe I don't know anything about love. Maybe it is all an illusion. No hay banda, there is NO band.  Maybe all anyone can ever know is the feelings they have. Maybe they're right, you can only find love once you stop looking.   Maybe they're the people that think I'm a "nice" person, but not the "date"-able type.  About as exciting as a wet sponge? At least I try. I have THAT going for me. I know a lot of people that don't even do that.  My pomade smells good. Peace- T

       scorpio love patterns   I found this to be interesting. It's basically what signs the scorpio find compatible and what not:  "You have an all-or-nothing approach to relationships, therefore you do not match up to all the signs. Here's a look at how you do interact with others.   SCORPIO & ARIES: - You make a hot combination in bed. Highly aggressive sex that could be described as implied violence. Lustful but not lasting due to your jealous nature.   SCORPIO & TAURUS: - Polar opposites that actually do quite well together. The Bull is stable and loyal enough to satisfy your intense nature. You both value long-term unions and are willing to work at them together.   SCORPIO & GEMINI: - This is not a likely match, the Illusive, fickle Gemini will drive you to distraction, which in turn could bring out your vengeful side.   SCORPIO & CANCER: - This is one of your best connections. The Crab is a loyal mate who is usually willing to stand behind you. Cancers are attracted to your strong, demanding ways.   SCORPIO & LEO: - This connection can lead to crimes of passion. Although you are strongly attracted to the Lion, Leo's flamboyant, flirtatious nature will cause anger that could erupt into murder-suicide.   SCORPIO & VIRGO: - The Virgoan has difficulties with your sexual leanings. You will bore easily and move on to more passionate partners.   SCORPIO & LIBRA: - This is not the best match. Libra is far too good looking and easy going for your jealous nature. You would likely end up spying on this social butterfly.   SCORPIO & SCORPIO: - Sexually you are truly compatible, however out of the bedroom you are far too much alike -- creating problems and mind games. You will always think that the other is having an affair.   SCORPIO & SAGITTARIUS: - This alliance is a waste of time for both parties. You are a homebody and the Archer is a travel nut. This is not a likely attraction.   SCORPIO & CAPRICORN: - This is a wonderful partnership. You both have the same values and cherish your home environment. Mentally and physically you match up well, easily satisfying one anothers needs.   SCORPIO & AQUARIUS: - Why bother. This will never work due to the Aquarian's need for freedom and your need to possess. Your values, ethics and approach to life are just too different.   SCORPIO & PISCES: - This is not bad. Probably the most erotic sexual combination. The Fish is willing to be a part of your whims and desires, and that makes for a lasting union.  "

       The Honeymoon period   I am confused by this statement. What does it mean to be in a honeymoon period? I understand the whole, in love with someone that you don't really get along with. But I have seen people that I thought would never be together in the long run, continue to make choices to stay together. They're obviously no longer in the honeymoon stage. It's just weird, maybe I haven't had a honeymoon stage, or maybe it's that I self protect. I dunno if any of this makes any sense. I need to work. Peace- T

       Frustration   So it turns out that I hadn't actually applied for the job at bioware, Alberta, BC. It seems as though my outlook was waiting for me to sign in again so it could send the application. I signed in last night, 3 days after the deadline for the job.  Anyway, I'm really frustrated by that, as I think it would at least have been a good interview opportunity. C'est la vie.  Another day, another 42.50.  Peace- T

       On Oregon, homes, and Desire   I often find that when I am at home, I have too much time to think. It is actually that I have time to reflect on what is important in my life as all of my distractions/problems are in Seattle.   My home  My parents want me in Oregon. They say that the job market is better, that rent is cheaper. They say that even if I move home I won't have to see them very much. They don't understand that it's not that I don't want to see them. It's that I don't want to live in Oregon! It's something of a love/hate relationship I have with the place. I sometimes love to visit there, but for the most part I LOVE living in seattle, or maybe it's just that most of my friends are up there? Maybe there is some sort of defeatist attitude I have about moving back home to the parents. *sigh*   My muse  My muse is back. I haven't missed her one bit. It seems that she only comes to me when I am heartbroken or in some sort of emotional dilemma. At least this muse is like that. I had another muse that taught me cool things like expanding my mind and learning to knit, but this muse is the old faithful "bad poetry" muse! This muse likes to torment me into writing from the longings of my soul and betrays my trust at every step of the way. She'll have me show these works of "poetry" to people I barely know and they may, for a moment or two, understand me.    Desire  I've come to the point in my life where I can be honest with myself and realize that I have desires. I want to be respected. I want to be loved. I want to love unabashedly. I want to quench the thirst of love in another, and have my thirst quenched in return. I desire the fruit of a woman. I long for sleeping in. I wish to be held. I long for cuddling. I desire to be known. I seek the human condition in all it's forms. I want the human experience. I long for understanding. I seek the treasure of our human experience. I hope to reprioritize my life, to make important all that is important and to disregard that which is not.   Priorities, lies, and the news  I have been reading the Te of Piglet and have at least mildly learned some of it's truths, which I have lived in understanding with for a long time, but have not practiced! The real hypocracy is that my senior year of college I wrote about the importance of non materialistic endevours, but knew full well I was pursuing a career that celebrate commercialism! Anyway, I know that I cannot buy happiness, no matter what the media tells you. In fact that whole idea of marketing is a lie! The idea that you NEED something, simply by running an ad on TV you can almost guarantee, no matter how worthless your product, someone will buy it!  I want to give up TV. I know it wouldn't be hard. I hardly ever watch it as it is. I noticed on the news tonight, (Staying with Parents) that the news is actually just a stressor that we've added to our lives. It has no GOOD quality what-so-ever! It mostly just brought news of murder, rape and theivery, that I personally could do nothing about! How is that an important thing to me?  I missed Seattle's volunteer day. I had to go to oregon. I want to give back to society to feel like I am an active member of our society and I'm having trouble finding ways in.  Well, it's 12:30, I need to sleep, Peace- Tim

       Of Mice and men   Did you ever read the book or see the movie? Sometimes I feel like the retarded guy. Lenny? It seems that whenever I find something soft and beautiful, through no fault of my own, I strangle it. Most of my relationships often end because I don't give enough space.  I am reading the Te of Piglet and see a bit of overanalysis in my life. Can you see it too?  Peace- T

       Luv   I just got finished watching "Something's gotta give" for the second time. I thought it made an interesting point about love. The point being that without opening yourself up to being hurt, you never experience love in it's most pure/best form.  Looking back on my relationships I wonder how much I may have held back or had held back from me. Good times can be fun, but I'm looking for love. I want the emotional side. I want a girl that I can say, "Have you met my girlfriend?" about. I want to be able to trust someone and be open with them. I want to be her desire.  I don't want to be scared of opening up and having it thrown back in my face.  I know that I can be anyone and do anything with my life. I know that I AM comfortable with who I am. I also know that I get bored at night when I don't have anyone to do anything with. I'm damn responsible, and I'm fun to hang with.  One thing I've always felt about love is, that you can only give love and hope that it is returned. You cannot buy love or force someone to love you.  Part of who I am is based on this notion of love. When I love someone, I try to make myself available to them whenever they may need me. Which often means that I fall for people who are a little sad, because I can help them be happy. I think that maybe I see myself as only useful for when people are going through tough times, so when times are flying high, I feel awkward. I'm not sure how much of this last paragragh is true, but they are thoughts that I'm having, so I'll leave them for the people of the web to read.  I'm in a blogging mood, thanks be to Oregon, Peace- Tim

       Too hot to handle   Here I am in sunny Oregon, and we're going to be watching movies. I don't want this to happen to me. When does the relationship change from active to passive? Was there ever any active relationship? How does one get to the point where the TV and movies have replaced the "go out and do things together"-ness of america?  I recall at one point being the slave to the TV. I don't want to be there again. I want to live through my active relationships. I want to be known as the guy that didn't just sit down and watch life go by. He was the guy who was always out doing stuff.  Hello, future life, can I have you today? Peace- T

      Hey Everyone-  I'm working on my C# skills now. I have hope again of becoming an SDET and maybe even a full on SDE someday, but for now, I'm working on my C# skills. I'm kind of stoked about it.  I'm still running every other day and am losing weight, so that is good. I'm still looking for a place to live, but my schedule at work has been throwing wrenches into the housing search.

      So I was thinking about how our parents love us. We can never fully reciprocate that love as we will never feel the same hope for a future as our parents see in us.  Your parents put all their love and hope in you, which becomes suffocating. You have to flee the nest and they hope that you make them proud.  When love is not a 2-way street it becomes burdensome and irritating.  Well, time to work. Peace- T

So I ran around greenlake and got home by 7:30ish. Not a bad way to start the day :)  I spent 9 hours here yesterday. That was "nice" and I may be doing OT again next weekend. We'll have to see.

I know I am a hard worker, and can excell at any given task, it's just I need to decide what that task will be. Also, I need to decide if I want to sell my car.

      Here I sit in my safe little house. Far from Terrorist threat. Far from any danger really. I mean, I'm a 26 yr old man that lives in a fairly safe residential area of Seattle. There aren't many people that would come attack me or go on a killing spree in my neighborhood. At least I don't think so.  Anyway, this world is pretty messed up. I mean, I live in a world of car accidents and dentistry, when half way around the world, they're beheading people to try and get other murderers out of prison. How is it that you think kidnapping people will get your leaders to be released? I mean, I guess terrorist is a good name. You think that using the terror of what you'll do will cause people to do what you want? Or are you even trying to get people to convert to your religion? Or is it merely a reason to kill?  I realize that I don't understand you. Sometimes I wish I could talk to you and make you understand love.  Peace, from a man in turmoil- T

      My friend recently told me about a friend of hers who is getting married. It seems that the guy wanted to marry her after the 3rd date, but that freaked her out. So he cooled things off and she eventually came around.  Things like that make me wonder if I should give up or go down fighting, especially if a girl is like, "I don't know". I often will disappear for a time and then come back and see what's up, but that NEVER works out. When you cut off communication it's a lot easier to get over someone. You quit thinking about them and caring as much.  Anyway, I think it's funny that he was ready to get married way before she was, and that she was able to be won over. Or maybe she just got freaked because she thought it should take longer. Or maybe because she wasn't ready to settle down yet. Or maybe because she thought he wasn't the ONE. Or maybe because she felt something better might come along.  I have no idea why she didn't want to get married, but now she does. She may be tohe only person that knows the true feelings. But it's kind of romantic.  Anyway, I need to work on writing my short story/autobiography of the early years. Peace- T

      If there is a God, then I think the religions may have it all wrong. I think that God must have created woman first. I think they(God, genderless plural) must have taken the bottle of beauty and the bottle of Grace and poured almost the entire contents into woman. Then when they saw what a great job they'd done, they decided to make man. But they didn't have as much beauty or grace to use on the second model. So they made up for it with fat and muscle and clumsiness. This ended up with the male model so prevalent in today's society.  Anyway, I was thinking about that as I was walking home from the park tonight and thinking about out more fair, pleasant looking sex.  I think that's all I have to say about that.

Day 2 of running around greenlake has proven to me that I should have never stopped running as I am completely sore after today's 2.8 jog. Well, 3 more days and then I'll take the weekend off.  I started eating salads for lunch. Yesterday's rang up at 1.95 and it was totally yummy. We'll see how today's goes.  Peace- T

I bought atkins bars for my snacks today. So I should be able to survive on the salad lunch, until dinner. But I need to go to sleep now as I have to get up at 6:45 :P  I hope everyone is doing good and I'll try and write soon. Peace- T

      So I'm hopefully going to be getting new shoes tomorrow. I would very much like to get new shoes as the ones I have right now have holes in the soles.  I've had some insights recently that I've been wanting to share with my general public but I've been busy, so here it goes.  Insight #1: Most jerk men aren't jerks to the women they're courting. In fact, some jerks will not be jerks to the women in their lives, just to other men. However, for some it will eventually shine through to all their relationships, no matter how much they care about others.  Insight #2: Some people don't care about anyone outside of themselves. This goes for most people, I presume, but it is still a bit surprising for me.  Insight #3: Birth and Death are all relative (and death is much more lonely than birth). Today I had dinner with 2 pregnant women and 1 woman knocking on death's door. The woman that is close to death was scary to look at and see what the future held for us all. I don't know what I'm trying to say, except that it was a very interesting lunch with an interesting crowd.  Insight #4: to get rid of skid marks, a man must shave his ass. (I actually found this out by reading craigslist a long while ago, but have yet to test it)   OK, I'm going to go to sleep- Peace- Tim

      I just wanted to give a shout out to all my adoring fans. I've been busy working this week, so my updates have been few and far between. For that, I apologize....  I have been taking the bus home, while I still have my bus pass. The powers that be have decided that contractors who have always gotten the bus pass privilege will now be denied. Another way to keep the separation of FTEs and CS. Sometimes I just want to run through the halls yelling, "CS are people too!!!" But I'm sure that would get me fired.  We're hoping that Mike's kid doesn't come tonight, we're getting him the hunger team aqua force season 1 DVD.  Well, I'm sleepy, catch ya later- T

      I keep getting spammed with all these "Find your true love here" emails in my junk mail folder. I think that there's probably a lot of money out there to be made off singles that are so socially awkward they're paying a website to help them find a match. (OK, OK, I have done the eharmony stuff in the past)  I don't know what I'm saying, maybe that there's lots of single folks out there and if they were out having fun, they might meet each other, instead of sitting at home in front of their computers... But really I'm just full of shit... Peace- T

      For some reason I am not tired this morning. I had some weird dreams last night. I dreamt that I emailed Cassie and they were like, Tim I'm sorry, but I've been dating someone for the past month or so. It was so weird cause the email was just like, hey how's it going?  Anyway, I went to bed at 11:45 last night and today I'm surprising refreshed. Although I did wake up several times last night from bad dreams. The one above and another one.  Anyway, I need to get to work. Peace- T

      I've killed the ponderingpool.blogspot.com  I think everyone was tired of writing, and it didn't blossom into anything beautiful, so I had to put it down.  I don't think I'm getting enough sleep at night. I know I'm exhausted right now, and should sleep, but my room is SO hot!!! :P  Anyway, I had some more to rant about, but I forget. Too hot, too tired.  Peace- T

      Well here it is, monday morning. I'm sleepy.  My weekend was very busy. The Harry Potter movie was good. I'm starting to read my next book, "Lightning" by Dean Koontz. Interesting quote in the book, "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; wile loving someone deeply gives you courage." - Lao Tzu  Anyway, I should get back to work, sleepily- tim

      Love can give you the ability to do the things you never thought you could. Love is able to have you take chances and give flight to new ideas more readily than any other form of hypnotics or drug. Love makes you want to be someone that is an image of what the person you love wants. Love can inspire you to learn a foreign language or take up scuba diving. Love can take your fears and throw them out the window. Love is such an awesome thing.

      I met my friends nate and kara and Dave G for dinner tonight. I haven't seen Nate & Kara for about half a year. This is something I am working on reversing.  Anyway, I started putting my "new" computer together last night. So that was exciting. My parents are coming into town tomorrow and then I'm going paintballing on saturday with Jarred. I've been able to keep my life pretty busy.  I think part of it may have to do with the fact that I'm trying not to slow down and feel too much. A friend recently told me that scorpios are moody and/or have mood swings. I could see that.  Anyway, I'm sleeping- T

      So here I am writing again.  I don't know what's going on in me. I have been here before, or have I? I have a strange sense of wandering again, but also of soul searching and longing. I recognize myself and think of who I want to be and who I want to help. I am re-arranging myself to be financially more stable.   All this thinking is fun, but I think I should start reading again. I've started walking home from my boss' house everynight, so that is good exercise. (30+ blocks or so)  I want to get in better shape, but I think I need to find someone to inspire me to get out a little more often, and maybe take up jogging with me. We'll see.  Anyway, I'm sleepy, catch you later- T

Someone that I could call whenever I felt like it and she wouldn't feel perturbed. Preferably someone that is cute. Someone that can keep up an intelligent conversation and will call me on my bullshit. Help me expand my horizons and teach me a thing or two.  I'm audi 5000- T

      I had a spectacular weekend. I think I did everything new under the sun. I went to folklife and watched belly dancing. I went to a concert and had some black russians. I went to Golden Gardens and walked around. I went to a dog park and watched the dogs play. I saw a movie, Supersize Me. I ate some pho and some Mr. Lee's Asian Restaurant. I went to Alki Beach and walked to boardwalk. I took multiple photos. I talked to Jay about a short film entitled "rejected".  My friend left for Hawaii today. She is going to see her sister and was going for the birth of her neice which happened a month early, yesterday. I think that would be frustrating.  Well, I'm sure she'll have fun and now I have to work again.  Lost in my sea of uncertainty- Tim

      I'm talking to a friend about types. She dated someone who prefered a 'type' that is complacent and would believe everything he said.  I can't figure any man that is threatened by a woman who thinks for herself?!?! Why would you want that? I don't understand wanting to mind fuck someone or just not be challenged when you're making a dumbass move. Why would you not want to consistently improve yourself?  Anyway, I think I need to go catch up on some sleep. (Work: 10 hours today, 9 hours tomorrow)  Goodnight- T

      I think it's humorous the cycles people can get in. But the question isn't whether people get in cycles, the question is, Can people change the cycles they're in, once they recognize them?   I know my step sister has a tendency to get pregnant everyother year, and that after she becomes pregnant, she ditches the father and goes back to church. Once the baby comes, she wants hardly anything to do with her other children... and starts sleeping with men again to become pregnant. Repeat   My question is, Do I sabotage my own relationships by opening up too little/opening up too much/opening up too quickly? Do I sabotage my relationships by wanting too much? Trusting too much? Trusting too little? Do I over analyze everything? I know I should just enjoy life and not think anything about my relationship, go with the flow (go with aunt flo?)    online peeps   I think it would be silly for me to try and hide who I am on my blog.&nbsp; I&nbsp;try to be as open an honest here as I should be in the real world. I often wonder if I am too blunt, or too raw. Part of the problem with knowing people read the blog is I may want to cover some feelings up, or censor my blog. I can't do that. I don't have the energy to hide myself from the blogging community, so please be patient with me, as I do have some prickly edges...  Time for sleep, Peace- T

      Well, my body decided to wake up at 6:00 this morning :P For those of you in the know, that means I got almost 6 hours of sleep last night.  I've been thinking about relationships recently. It seems like I'm fairly good at destroying them, even when I think that it's where I want to be. (see pushing away) Along with relationships comes the idea of how people meet. In college I fell in love with 1 girl because she shared her poetry with me, when she would show it to no one else. I totally fucked up that relationship :P What about the blogs? Are they a good way to meet people? You deal with peoples inner most thoughts on here, maybe something they never tell anyone in RL. They could be completely socially dipolar, but you may never know. They could be the best thing since sliced bread. Trust is a funny thing.  Am I being cynical? I don't know. I should go back to bed... Peace- T

      So a bit of randomness...  Cable internet got installed yesterday. It kicks DSL's ass up and down the street.  I worked 13 hours today. So I'm a big loopy. I wish there was another reason I was loopy, but it just seems to be sleep related :)  I find it interesting that it's about 70 degrees outside and can remain 80+ degrees in my room.  I want to save money, but I get this overwhelming sense that I should spend it too. No shopping therapy for this boy. I am going to save it for my rainy days ahead.  I want to run tomorrow, but my running buddy is away, and I need to sleep after today's long hours.  Meeting new peeps is fun. Being a dick at work is not.  Exhaustedly yours- Tim

      It seems to me that people either blog, or they don't blog. Those that don't blog often have a tendency to see blogging, not as a social forum or peoples random opinions,&nbsp;as something that is time consuming that has little to no reward in the here and now world of the day to day.  I have often become a non blogger for months at a time, but I have always kept this site up. Occasionally I update it, but only when I have no/little social opportunities with my friends. I reach out to my blog and post in the realization that no one is reading it. Until they got the profiles where you can search for people with blogs with similar interests. I've now had 3 people leave messages in the past 4 weeks.  It's an odd feeling to be found on the internet. Besides my friends, I'm sure no one had really read it until a few months ago.  It seems maybe that I should filter it and look through and delete any posts that I have grown through or out of, but that would be faking my past. I would hate that.  Anyway, here's to random people stopping by my website and new friends. I hope you like what you see! Peace- T

      It's amazing how we can get caught up with who we want to be with, before deciding who we are. I think that you can not change who you are so much than to grow to be someone else. The point being that being comfortable with who you are, and respecting yourself will make you attractive to others(love wise anyway)  Sometimes I think I am a total asshole that nobody would like (work has a way of turning you into the enemy when you'd just as happily surf the internet like your compatriots) or a "nice" guy that nobody wants to sleep with.   I know that I'm a nice guy, but I have a tendency to at least try to hit rock bottom as Chuck would say. I'm torn between the slacker that I could be and the responsible man/boy that I am.  I know that I'm cute, but I never come off as overly confident when talking to women, which I KNOW is not a turn on. It's the great mystery. Wanting sex, but playing at that you don't want it.  I do miss sex. Masturbation just isn't the same as getting it on. I know that not all of you might realize this, but I have lost that sacred virginity thing a while ago :O   Anyway, it's not like I'm looking at just wanting sex. It's the whole relationship that would be nice. I want to be desired and fulfill that desire in someone else.  Please note: In case you can't tell I'm still working 70/hr work weeks and have NO time to pursue a full on relationship. As I thought of it tonight, my life is a big canvas of grey, where I have no need to leave work, but I see the rainbow at the end of the tunnel and long for that day when I'll have my accrued earnings and no job:)  Here's to new friends and old enemies- Peace- The T

      Is it ok to NOT use your talents? Should you always use the talent that you have in for a job if you can? I think the subway guy might want to hire me, and I think I would have a lot less stress in that sort of job, but I wouldn't be using any of my 1337 h4X0r skills like I use here? I think part of the dilemma would be that I'm not full time here, but subway isn't quite a career type workplace.  I don't know, I'm going back to work. Peace- T

      When you have a subject for blogging and then you forget it right when you're about to start. I think I was going to mention about how I found this website:   urlLink Being friends   And how it has a fairly easy (step by step) from going from lover to friend. So I was thinking of trying to follow those hints...  There was also this website:   urlLink Love handles   Which has to do with strengthening the love handles. So I was thinking of trying out that as well. I think it's interesting that both articles are mostly talking to women. Is it that I'm so feminine or that I have my sensitive male side thing going on. (metrosexual? Am I a crab person?)  Anyway, I'm running at 7 am tomorrow, I need to sleep.  Peace- T

      I was eavesdropping on my housemates friend tonight. She's going through a breakup (went through?) and it was sad to hear my words coming out of her mouth. The "What do you mean right now? Does that mean later?" questions, and the "overall acceptance that nothing may ever change so I should move on" talk.  It made me sad to know that's what I sound like when I talk to my friends. And it made me sad to know that I need to give up loving "her".  I've been thinking about the roles "loved" vs "lover". I think it is harder to be the lover than it is to be the loved. As a friend was saying, The father, no matter how traumatized his psyche was by the child birth, will never feel the pain that the mother felt. So it is for the loved and the lover. The lover will always feel more pain from rejected love, than the loved will feel from rejecting the love. At least that's the way it seems to work.  I got off early tonight, but I had nothing planned, so I watched my roommates play video games, and tried to fix my old computer. (Bad Hard drive, won't reformat :P ) Now it's 11 and I NEED to sleep.  Talk to you all soon, Peace- T

      I would like a tattoo because I would like to have some art to look at while I'm in the shower. Or have a piece of art that I can have always to have some fun with. I think that a tattoo would be nice for conversation starting and allow me to have a unique way of expressing myself.   At this point, I am in decent enough shape that my tattoo shouldn't have too much misshaping over the next few years. I may go with something like a musical note or maybe a dog. I don't know, I need to think about this... :S   Peace-  T

      I'm thinking of doing the monk thing for a while. I kind of became frustrated with my lack of sex today and had to have another DTR with the ex.&nbsp; &nbsp; So, here I am, if I give up on the fact of having the sex again within the next 10+ weeks, I think I can become a game testing GOD! Or at least secure me a blue badge position? I don't know but I think I SHOULD use my amazing computer abilities for good, but sometimes it's so easy to be evil :) &nbsp; So, I ended up only working 15.8 hours this weekend:) Gotta love the OT. I hate that I cancelled my 7am run, but am glad that I'll still have a run tomorrow night. &nbsp; I'm lost in a sea of wondering and hate the fact that I have heartache. I want to have it removed, but I don't know how. &nbsp; Peace from the sleepy- Tim

       OK, so it's like a BILLION degrees in my room right now. I could sleep until Sunday, but I'm at work from 10 - 8&nbsp; tomorrow :P    &nbsp;  Anyway, I was thinking about drugs the other day. I think sometimes there is a time and a place for drugs. and then there is also a time and a place to be drug free. For me, being drug free is key right now. I'm trying to stay at the top of my game, and I'm a bit tired now, w/o any drugs. I don't know where I'm going with this, so I'm just going to stop.    &nbsp;  Well, I have too many things to do. Including pay my bills and sleep, so I'll try and remember what I wanted to talk to my bloggy neighbors about, and will get back to you.    &nbsp;  Peace-   T

      My life for the past few years has been the life of the contractor. I thought I might share some tidbits into this most bizarre existence that we have created.  The goal of a contractor is to become a real employee (goal #1). Everything we do is a hope to someday attain the reliable check of a full time employee. At least that is the way it is for at least 95% of us.  Every 9 - 12 months I am forced to take a 100-day non-paid leave. This can put the hurt on, as most of the time this happens from November - February. One goal many of us have is to be able to contract again after this 100-day break (goal #2). If no employer is willing to rehire you, then you will have a pain in the ass trying to get back in.  Key points to maintain while you ARE a contractor. 1) ALWAYS be available for overtime - this is key, especially when you have low finances, missing 1 OT session could mean your slot is no longer available for a few weeks. (also, OT is considered a perk that may not last much longer, if you are given the opportunity you should seize it, as full-time employees don't get time and a half)  2) Don't hound about become a full time employee - first impress your boss by ALWAYS being available for OT, then be ready to answer off hand remarks about future job positions  3) Know how to be a hard worker (This is key because you're trying to shine above the rest of your cohorts, some of which the full times have pet names for, i.e. Crazy legs)  4) Know how to get shit done (When your boss comes and asks you to do something, the first time you may ask questions, after that you should KNOW how to do it. If given a task by your boss, you should complete your tasks and have a short 1 - 2 sentence response with your results. Having written results in an email can also be a great way for your boss to know the info, without you having to interrupt his work day)  5) If your boss enters the room, be the first person to ask if they need any help. They will begin to look to you as a person that can get shit done. This will help in both goal #1 and goal #2.   That's really about all you can do while you're a contractor. If you impress your boss enough, he may decide you are a valuable asset which should be hired full-time, but it takes a LOT of work to get to this point.   Hang in there and you may make it. But usually people will either not be hired back (black listed) or get "real" jobs elsewhere.  That's about all I have to say about that. It's interesting to think about the parallels that appear in my life to this particular segment. Peace- Tim

      I AM working today. I lied about not working, although technically it wasn't a lie, because at the time, I thought I wasn't. C'est la vie.  I dreamt last night. I dreamt I woke to check my email and had 2. One was from my ex and another from work. Before I could answer either, a coworker came into my bedroom and started asking me about a bug they had found while I was sleeping and whether or not it was a known issue. I followed him over to where Peter's room is and our computer lab was all setup and running with my boss asking me if it was a known issue. I told him I didn't know and would have to see the bug to know if others had seen it. I woke shortly after looking at the problem and telling my coworker that we didn't have it recorded and he should write up the bug.  The past couple of nights I've been thinking about Faith and religion. I KNOW I could never vote for Bush, but have I strayed so far from the Christian faith? Do I believe that all religions are a crutch? Do I think that faith in a religion is only for those who have given up thinking for themselves or do I still believe? Do I want there to be someone/something/(an all loving God) out there that wants to see me succeed? Is there a plan for my life and am I on the right path? Should I worship at the church of Microsoft and bow to the almighty dollar?  Of religion, I can say for certain, they do re-emphasis the spirit as the most important thing. People are the reason I was put on this earth. Without friends and family, without new acquaintenances, without people, life would be ever so dull. I'm just not sure "saving" the soul is what is needed.   Well, I need to get ready for work. Peace- T

      So I had random post at 5:30 this morning, which meant I woke up at 5:30 and wrote a post, then tried to sleep until 7am when I got up to go running with Cliff. That didn't really happen.  Fortunately, I was able to sap enough restfulness out of that hour and a half to be affective today :) Running is good. It makes me feel awake and healthy. Anyway, it seems like I may get off this weekend so I'll have time to run errands!!! YAY!!!  I've also been remembering this movie I saw like 2 years ago with Jarred. It's called "Intacto" and is a spanish film about luck. It was really great and if you love foreign films I highly recommend this one.  Anyway, I've got some Localization peeps to manage. Peace- T

      I often wonder what makes me want to be so responsible. It seems that if I wanted I COULD get away with not working for long periods of time and maybe just live off the state for a while (see step-sister)  But instead, I want to succeed in a career. I want to be praised by my coworkers and stand out in the minds of my bosses. I want to be desired for full time employment at the risk of sabotaging personal friendships at work.  I don't understand who I am, nor why I have an overwhelming sense of responsibility for a job that I could just as easily lose next week.

      It's true. I miss having even a pseudo girlfriend. Now it's the 4th of July and I have to be at work in 11.5 hours and the F*CKING neighbors won't stop letting off fireworks!!!  I have my run in the morning, but my friend Cliff (see running buddy) is moving to Lake Samamish(sp?) plateau. That means my current running buddy (see best friend) will be 45 minutes away on a good commute day :(  I am trying to get C# under my belt like no tomorrow. I have gotten my program to a point where I can download a webpage and extract all the img file locations and links. Next I need to work on erraticating duplicate links and links to other websites. Then I need to download each new webpage and rinse lather and repeat. It's really fun to problem solve and get this all figured out, but I'm scared that it won't be enough to land me a job :(  Anyway,I'm exhausted and horny and lonely, so I'm going to sleep. To all those out there celebrating the 4th. Happy independence day and I'll see you on the 5th.  Peace- T

      It's true. I found out today that I am officially exhausted. I imagine I'll have 1 more day off this summer. Sunday, and then it's working everyday until we ship.  Props to heather for finding me and leaving the comments. I think a love of Guster is good, but finding a needle(Tim) in a haystack(The internet) is even more amazing :)  I'll check you guys later. A total exhausted Tim.

      Hey Everyone-  I just found out that July 2nd is the world wide (national?) 'I forgot' day. That means that today you can make up for anything you've forgotten about in the last year. W00T.  Anyway, yesterday was 'Canada' day. So for all you Canadians out there. Happy Canada day! (It's I forgot day, and since I forgot Canada day, does that make it ok to mention it?)  and in case I don't get out of this working coma, Happy Independence Day!!! Let the fireworks begin!!! W00T  Peace out- T

      He follows you around, He thinks you're so cool, He wants to be just like you, You friends are getting annoyed by your little tagalong, it's becoming quite the nuisance  He needs to get his own life, quit sucking his life from you,  He used to be cute and endearing, but now he's just a pain.

      So I think the loneliness is beginning to get to me. I haven't had a good talk with anyone for a long time. I would count the days, but they all start to jumble in my mind. I think I've been burning the candle at both ends for too long and it's finally catching up with me. I need some relax and chill time with people, if only just to talk about my feelings. OR maybe I just need a good nights sleep and then I won't have these lonely feelings anymore.  Who knows? Peace out- Tim

      It's crunch mode in t-minus , oh wait, we're in the middle of it. Another day and we've got Strep throat in the office. I am praying that I don't get it, and neither do my testers. I guess time will tell.  I got a package from a friend today. I need to start reading again, and filling my head with fun ideas.  Anyway, I need to sleep. Running in t-minus 7.3 hours. Peace- T

      So, I'm having trouble sleeping. It's one of those toss and turn nights.... So I popped in a little Fight club:) I love that movie. It got me thinking about some things... If I wake up too exhausted too many days in a row, Do I wake up as another person? Am I actually 2 people living my life? I feel as though my life could be pulling in 2 different directions. My reponsible side wants to get full-time employment with MS, while my playful side wants to say F*ck it all, I'm going to work at subway!  Anyway,I used to think I had a lot of posts on here "566"... but now I realize that all those months that I took off from blogging were months where other people were at least blogging once or twice a week :) Good thing this isn't a competition, otherwise I would have lost:P  Note to self: Must update blogger profile to include mulholland drive... also, must sleep, we wouldn't want to wake up tyler:)

      So I am basically managing 14 people now. I am Mr. "go-to-guy" in the department. I know that some of my coworkers despise me for this, but I won't apologize for it. I do make myself known to be available for the developers and I do make myself available to the higher ups. If you want to despise me for doing a good job, then so be it, but don't downright undermine me.  I don't know, it seems like people would rather argue with me, since I sincerely have no power over them, than to try to help me with something that a developer might need.  Anyway, I digress... I wanted to write about the things one deals with when "managing" 14 people, or something like that. I forget.  Anyway, I should start programming again and maybe I'll be able to get a really real job!! Now if I only knew where that quote came from... dammit!  Goodnight- T

      I'm listening to Guster right now. It's good therapy music. Some of the songs are good for being alone. Some are good for heartbreak. Some are good for starting over. Some are good for finding someone new.  I'm confused as to who I am right now, or what music I need. I know that I'm a good person that will continually try to do the right thing. If that's not a desirable attribute, then I guess I won't be desirable. Everything in me wants to help others succeed. But even as I write that, I know it's not true. I know that I don't want people that talk down to me to succeed faster than me. I know that there are people that drive me nuts and whom I probably dislike enough to not want them working where I work.  I'm always analyzing peoples skills and where they might fit best (at work anyway) I categorize my friends. I hide my feelings, in order to self protect, as almost everyone I know will leave sooner or later.  I think I talk better in person or on the phone than I do in email, but I don't know if that's true. I know I can charm, but I don't know how I do it. Someone once told me to stop manipulating them, but I didn't know how or if I was actually doing it. I don't have a conscience malisciousness, but maybe there is something darker inside?  I want to trust new friends, but I also don't want to get burned. It's a fine line. Trust is a good thing.  I'm running in 8.5 hours, I'm going to bed. Peace- T
