       10 km.  Rode the Jänese track with a mate. As it has been raining all night and day, its _rather_ dirty. But i cant say it wasnt fun. Oh yes, it was. All those dirty puddles and mud. And the surprise puddles of course. The ones that turn out to be half a meeter deep holes filled with dirty water so you cant see the bottom. Henceforth the wize words: when going through a puddle, lift the front wheel so it lands clear on the other side. So you will avoid nasty surprises. I did that, my mate didnt. The differences were visible.

       Alles rites.  52 km. I and a mate of mine from the sinilille.org crew went to Vapramäe. The 52 km in itself wasnt that bad. But at the location we "met" an older (than me, that is) gentleman who was zooming downhill at 300 km/h. We happened to be pedalling UP that hill. So he wasnt very pleased to see us, as we heard from behind. He didnt crash, luckily. As  urlLink Lasse  pointed out, it wasnt probably his land and there are no strict rules on wich way the tracks must be traversed.  It just so happened that we happened to be leaving at the same time and in the same direction. The gentleman hurried off and rode a gap some 200 meters between him and us. We, okay, Lasse, decided to chase him. It just so happened that i lead the way in "the wind". After 20 or so kilometers (anyone know the exact distance?) at 30+ km/h at all times, i was feeling rather, um, strange. But then, on the final hill before town, i caught him. Well, yes, i did keep a gap of 20 meters out of sheer politeness, but that was it. Really. I do say it was the race of my life. Only that my competitor didnt know it was a race. But still, fun it was.  I also wanted to say im going to try to create my very own template for the blog. You will see how it turns out.   Also, about the camera thing, i have probably chosen the one we're going to get. You will be kept posted.  Also also wik (monty python joke), i wanted to say my bike is falling apart. Sort of. It feels sort of wobbly and it makes all sorts of noises, even when i painstakingly cleaned every possible part of it. Just wobbly. Seems that the front cogs (that IS the word for the spiked wheels the chain runs on, isnt it?) are out of perfect alignment with the frame and so on and so forth and so on and so forth. Im really sad. Dont want to be forced to get yet anohter new one.  [music: Bob Marley - No Woman No Cry]  If you havent heard that one, you havent lived. Period. End of discussion.

       Well then.   Just got back from some nice star wars gaming. Lots of fun. Today seemed to be an A-Team memorial session. If anyone is intrested, what you probably arent, i could briefly describe what went on. But that would have to include a description of what a role-playing game is. That would show you what a freak i am. No really, we are pretty much normal people, us roleplayers. Not considering that we do ritual dances with blood and worship the devil, naturally.   I rode my mothers bike for a kilometer or two and found out that my bike isnt the worst in the world. Its the second worst.

       Yay, estonians arent the only crazy people.  Check out  urlLink rate.lv   I was actually trying to find a picture of a "pelmeen" at google when i came across this.  Check out the TOP PUIŠI and the TOP MEITENES sections. The tops or so. All in latvian, of course. I mean, if the rate thing is this bad here, i cant even imagine what happens when latvians start doing it.  No, i dont dislike latvians really, it just seemed a proper place to include some humour about the neighbours dislike of eachother.  Peace, luv an' hospitality, mates.   But still, any estonian has a stuffed latvian somewhere in the cupboard. The people from Saaremaa have two.

       So then.  Been away from teh comp for a really long time. Almost three days or so, wasnt it? Okay, maybe a bit more. First off, 1200 * 1024 pixels seem huge again. What a nice feeling.  Onwards to the summary, then:  First leaving home on Tuesday, or so i think it was. Wedensday was Jaanipäev (descripton of that in some past post). Jaanipäev is celebrated on the summer solstice (spelling?). That makes it the longest-time-of-daylight day in the year. So yes. LOTS of daylight right now. So where im getting to is that we left home with mom on Tuesday evening, at 12:30 at night. So we got to stay up the shortest night of the year driving through the rather nice estonian countryside. I really liked it. As it was dawn at 3 in the morning with some 4 - 5 of hours of darkness at night, we got to Nõva (our country place) in full daylight. Seeing dawn like that is nice. I wish i had a camera. More about that later.   So we got there.  I wake up at 3 or so and start work on my bike. I switch the tires and all. Put the wheels back onto the bike and stuff like that. All good. So i and my dad go out for a test ride or so. All is good for a kilometer or two. Nice forest trail, sun shining, birds singing. As the mates from the sinilille.org crew might know, my bike had been making real strange, unexplainable by modern science, noises in the driveshaft area (i dont really know the english term yet). I mean the area between the ends of the two pedals, where there is an axle connecting the pedals inside the bike. One of the corners of the triangle that make up the bike's frame or so. So yes, there had been noises, but we all HAD thought it was because i hadnt oiled the axle. So im just frolicking down this village trail having recently oiled the axle and everything. Frolic frolic, feeling good. And then, out of the blue: SNAPPPP and my left leg falls down next to the right. The damn (one of the few times i curse over the net, mind you) axle had broken. Its 15 millimeters of f**ken METAL. Metal, i say. Im wondering if i am too tough for this bike, too. That much about my biking holiday, then, i thought, and so it was, too. Cursing, i went back home and looked into the matter with dad. So we found out that the 15 mm axle had just snapped out of the blue. Nothing to do, i put the bike into the shed for the holiday as Jaanipäev is a holiday here and people don't have to work. How convinient.  The next day was Jaanipäev, then. We went to Haapsalu, a town some 40 kms from our summer-house. Nothing really interesting there. On the trip there we saw a moose counting cars or something in a swamp next to the road. We had a good look at him. When we were coming back, he was some 200 meters from the previous place, still counting cars or something. We took some photos of him, but he was sort of far for the lame-ass no-zoom camera we have. Its not even digital. More about that later. So we took pictures of him and drove on after a while. Before getting home we saw 3 fox kids. Not the tv channel, the animals. I think i got some nice pictures of one, i ll get them up when they get developed.  The next day we spent in Tallinn, the capitol, giving people money. Some would call it shopping, but my definition of shopping involves getting some item of note for your money, unlike we did.  Anyway, Tallinn is a silly place and i dont understand how a third of the population can live there. As we were just driving into town i was watching what was going on outside. People were getting killed, tanks were rumbling around, some firemen were running by with a christmas three on their backs and a homeless man was trying to convince a shop owner he wasnt Picasso. Okay, that might be a little exxageration here and there, but still. So here i am sitting amidst (that is a word, right?) all that fray feeling the effect they sometimes do in the movies when they film something for a long time and then play it very fast. Like the clouds moving or a NY street. Thats pretty much like i felt, too, the fastforward NY street. And then dad, who visits Tallin quite often, says: "oooooh, look at how quiet everything is today". I felt really strange. I decided i would probably have lit myself on fire if i had had to live there.  Good thing is i got my bike fixed. The people at the repair shop had faces like a car mechanic might have when the passenger seat opened the door, walked out of the car, bought a hot-dog, and got back into the car. Nobody had ever heard about anything like that before.   I was really glad to get away from all that.   In the evening i just did a quick 20 km forest terrain - gravel ride. I almost crashed into a moose. I wonder if it was the same one we took photos of. It sure looked similiar enough.   The next day, that being yesterday, i had a longer bike trip. 80 km from my house to Haapsalu and back. 28.3 km/h average speed. Considering that 25 km of the trail was gravel, i think it was pretty good. It is strange that the gravel parts were actually faster. I think it's the adrenaline u get on gravel roads. Felt rather exhausted afterwards, too. Oh, and yes, i had the usual mountainbike tires, not slicks. Makes me tuff, innit?  On to today. Nothing spectacular really. Just a quick bike trip with dad exploring the forests around the summer-house. 20 km. Just wanted to mention that gravel roads at 38 km/h are interesting. Sort of Marko Märtin style.  And now, for the camera thing:  I have now decided i want a decent camera. Semi-pro or something. With optical zoom and not quite the "soapbox" as we call them here. So if any photo people are reading that, do contact me via comment or messenger. When i was in Tallinn, i had several moments, too several to mention, where i felt i wanted a camera. I decided that when i get one, i will have a trip to Tallinn just to take photos of things. So yea.  Ahh, long post it has been. Over and out for now.  Edit:  Just wanted to add that i noticed im developing a biker's tan. That being a striped sort of tan-thing you get while wearing all sorts of things including gloves with no fingers.  Also wanted to add the famous estonian people's saying in my own words:  The leg of the brave biker is bloody.

       To my classmates:  The Jaanipäev celebration for our class will be (most probably) held at Taavi K's residence in Peedu. I think it was so. The date: July, 8 and 9.  So yes, be prepared. More information after monday. In the meantime, ask Madli. And Taavi K.

       As  urlLink Mikk  points out:  discovered some good reggae music^_^. i have am listening a lot of reggae lately. and belive me , it's good. reggae, i mean. and that's good too that i am listening it.   It is nice indeed to find some fellow freaks on this side of the equator. And oh yes, he changed the address of his blog, somewhy. I hope he will quit doing that. I have to change the links bar on the left now and everything. Mikk, would you please stick to an address and use it.  And now for something completely different (that is a monty python quote, if anyone cares):  I just boght yet anohter inner tube. I also got myself a pump. For air, that is. As im going away to the country till monday or something for the Jaanipäev celebration. (Jaanipäev is the celebration of the beginning of summer, for you non-estonians. We make huge bonfires and if drunk enough, try to jump over them. I wont get into the more, ehm, shall we say, private, sorts of entertainment. Not that those kinds would be only for Jaanipäev. Im not sure why im even writing about this. Anyway, Jaanipäev means the day of Jaan, wich is a male name in estonian. We also use(d) to bring birches into the house. In the modern times, of cource, its rather difficult to do so we dont. The country people still do. Some of them, anyway. Oh, and yes, they do look for the blossom of the  urlLink sõnajalg  (dryopteris atrata). The trick here is that they dont have blossoms at all. So they say that if you do find one, you are lucky. I say that you are drunk enough.)  So yes, the country. As i dont have the luxury of gas-station automatic air compressors, i need a pump to put my ruff terrain tires back again. I want to ride the nice sandy forest roads there. Lots of crashing with the loved clipless system, i bet.   Over a long time, i am actually looking foward to going to the country. That is something. So dont change biking doesnt do one good.  And yes, i also spoke to the nice person at the bike shop and found out that buying another rims and the stuff that goes with them will cost about 1300 kroons or 87 €. (eur conversions to practice understanding how much stuff costs in euros in order to be comfortable with it once we switch to the euro.) So yes. I will have to give up eating and wearing clothes in the near future. And dont even think about entertainment.  P.S The new pictures are up.  P.P.S I recently saw 65 visits on my counter. Thanks to all of you for reading this. I hope you will return.  P.P.P.S I keep typing "u" instead of "you" automatically. I dont want to, really.

All in all, it was a very nice happening and i once again got assured that we have (had) a very pleasant bunch of people in our class.  Well, what else can i say...

       Well then.  Now i am officially somewhat educated. At least, i have done all the country makes me do.   The festive meeting was rather nice, actually. I really liked my suit. Anyway, about the meeting, then.  Was our entry stilish, or what. Unfortunately, not all of the people saw it. But still. We and the people from where i live, that being Tähtvere, were in one of   urlLink these  and a mate from Ropka, another part of town, had one of  urlLink those . The one we were in was my father's birthday gift to a friend of his and the other one was my classmate's brother's. His father got it to him as a present. So then. We had two VERY stilish russian cars. First, i and my father, who did the driving, picked up all the people from the Tähtvere area. It was five us plus my father. Then we met up with the other car and drove a circle around the school block meanwhile having an episode with a street being dug up and having to close the traffic to be able to back onto  an useable road. We did the circle and drove into the school yard. They dropped us off right at the door. I liked it. With all of us looking so good (especially the ladies, of cource) it must have been a sight. Well, then there was the festive meeting itself. (Damn, i dislike calling it that, but thats what my school has taught me to call it.) It was nice. As we were walking to get the diplomas and back, they read some text about us. Who we are and what might become of us and so on and so forth. I liked that.   A nice surprise was a girl from the parallel form, or the B form, whereas i am (was) in form 9 A (but most of the readers know that anyway), singing. She had a very beautiful voice. If she is going to pursue a music career, she is going to be succsessful. I wouldnt mind paying heaps of money to buy her stuff, really. When she started to sing i wondered if it was coming from a tape or not. I would not have expected such a beautiful, and as far as i can say (wich isnt much because my ears arent really trained. Drum'n bass doesnt teach one that, unfortunately.) proffessional voice from such a young (well, we arent SO young anymore, but still) singer. I love her. voice and singing.  And then there was the eighth-formers (the ones organizing the festive meeting) with their samba-salsa-whatnot thing. That was very good too.   After the official part, we went outside and took heaps of pictures of eachother. And exchanged flowers. Then we came home. A reason to drive around some more with the Volga.   I will try to get some pictures up as soon as possible. Here i have a request to the public. If any of you took pictures at the meeting, please send them to me. If you have already done so, please send me the links. If you have them on paper, bring them to me and i will scan them. So we can have the pictures in one place and everyone can see them. Otherwize everyone just has their own pictures. I do think they are worth sharing. So do contact me via comment or messenger or e-mail.  [music: Chumbawamba - She's Got All The Friends]

       Now that i started thinking about those nine years i've been going to school a lot of things have happened. With us taking part and not. With us wanting to or not.   We have grown up. Or grown upper than we were before, that is for sure. I might say some of us are almost grownups. Then again, some definately arent.  We have done silly things. And laughed at them. And we've done good and bad things. At any rate, we have done lots of em.   Now that i start thinking, there are still people who i know very little about. As for some, it's too late to do anything about it. As for some, i dont really want to. And yet for others, i have three years to get to know them as we will be attending the same school. Of course, there will be lots of new people to meet, too, but this entry is dedicated to the Old Good Gang. Unfortunately, it is somewhat breaking up now. I am really sad about some people leaving, as we all are. No, this isnt about girls. Not primarily, anyway. (This sentence is here pretty much only to make me sound cool.) Im really sad to see Andry leave, to name some. Although he did speak of being able to retake the entry tests to the school in autumn. I guess, again, that we will just see.  Then again, i know some people very well. And i cant say that i know anybody too well not to be friends with them. Most of the people are very nice. As a matter of fact, i cant say i especially dislike someone. Yes, there are some minor dislikings, as there always are. But it really is (was) a very nice bunch of people. As mentioned, i havent had the time to really know them all. But the ones that are my closer friends are great. I mean, really.   During the first years, there were sort of "gangs" who were friends with eachother. Socializing with people from other gangs was rather minimal. No, we werent hostile. We werent even cold or anything, its just that one socialized with his close group of friends. The other gangs didnt mean as much.  During the last two years or so (beyond that i just dont remember so well), i have felt the gangs sort of dissolving into each other. For the last two years we have been a single unit, so to speak. That has fealt really nice. I sort of have become friends with more of the people. Maybe that has something to do with my changing seating, too, i dont know. Basically, i had a very nice bunch of deskmates in all classes, this year. Than you all, if you happen to read this.  All in all, i now wish that the group would stay together longer.   So yes, this is dedicated to all the people finishing the ninth form with me this year. I love you all.  [music: Beenie Man - I've Got A Date]  A very nice positive bit.

       Well then.  From a bikers perspective, there are good things and bad things beginning with S. From the good side, slicks, for example. And shower(s) as a negative.  So yes, i bought myself slicks today. Nothing fancy, rather cheap ones actually, but the difference between slicks and usual mountainbike tires is immense. I did 40 kilometers on asphalt with an average of 31 km/h. Not too exhausting, but i can feel that i have ridden. For the latter 20 or so kilometers, it was raining. Rather a lot. Different from what one would expect, it was rather good to ride in the pouring rain. Yes, i had to put my glasses away because they got wet, but the rain sort of kept the wind away. I got cold, though. Even after a warm shower my legs tremble now and then.   One thing i noticed about biking today. Road biking trains your muscles while mountain biking trains lung capacity. Thats what i believe at the moment. I might be wrong, but it would seem logical. Road biking (at least here in flat estonia) is more or less a constant mid-level exercise whereas mountainbkiking is periods of straining exercise (uphills) followed by periods of downhill rest. So i would suppose i want a mix of both. That means that im going to have to get myself anohter pair of rims in the future so that swapping tires will be faster. Today we (okay, it wasnt me, but still, im not going to blame anyone) managed to puncture a tube while changing my tires. A tube every time i switch tires is a bit too expensive. And we might not have a spare one every time, too.  EDIT: Also, i hear i got the englsh exam a 5. I also hear that only one person got a 4. And to him, i believe, it was a good thing. He, i believe, has studied hard to get a 4 because he usually didnt get 4s. Congrats.

       The Postimees  urlLink writes :  Tallinna Juhkentali gümnaasiumi õpetajad aitasid 60 abituriendil matemaatika riigieksamil spikerdada, peites lahendatud ülesanded eksami ajal tualettruumi, kus õpilased said käia neid maha kirjutamas.    For the non-estonian reader: its an article about cheating during the national math exams for the 12th formers. The teachers hid the right answers in the toilet.   I am stunned. Really. Teachers arent supposed to do that. I never thought that could be possible. The schools' greed for good results is getting so big they do anything to get them better. Although in  urlLink my school  they do it differently. They actually teach us so we get better results. As we can see, not all schools have the priviledge of having teachers that can teach. So they must resort to business such as that. Those teachers should be shot.  In addition to being unfair towards all the other pupils (had succeededeeded, that is) it is cruel to the pupils they tried to help. Pretty much all of them must now wait for a year before graduating. A year without nothing to do and no educaction to get a job. If it's a poor family, it can be really nasty.  I believe sacking the teachers is really the LEAST they should do. Maybe some extra punishment for causing misery for all those pupils, too.  Of cource, it is somewhat the pupils' own fault, too. After all, they had the chance not to go and read the right answers. But most still did. So i dont feel very sorry for them.

       A new day again. First day as a free man, i might say. I was just thinking that if i wanted, i could get a job now. A real job. Not that i would want one. My plan is to stall with any real working as long as i can. That means another 3 years in school and then some university onto the top of it all.   Woke up late today. Felt nice. If i succseed in getting myself slicks today, wich i probably wont, because my parents' wallets are not endless and my stomach can only take a knife once in a while, it will be all the better.   Also going to have tea and cake with grandparents. Getting the education and all. They have helped me a lot with it, too. My grandmother has taught me russian and my granfather, a mathemathics professor, has taught me math. I really love them for that. But not just for that, obviously. So yes, tea and cake.

       50 km today.  Now i am the only one from the sinilille.org crew that HASNT got slicks. It's rather uncomfortable to ride like that because the slicks create differences in speed. Either i work my arse off in the front and they relax in my wind corridor or they work in the front (but not as half as hard as me at the same speed) and i work a little less at the back. Also, parts of my bike are falling apart. Namely, the bearings at the front, supporting the pedals. I dont actually know the english term. I think they are by the sounds, anyway. Im beginning to wonder if i need a new bike. Or rather, when is the most economical time to get a new one. My father is going to kill me. For real. I might just do it myself, kind person as i am.  Anyway, i still got my Education. Ahh, no more school now. I heard i got the maximum (15) points for the english oral exam. Not too difficult, that. And all the girls that kept fainting over and over because of the panic can relax now too. Yay. Or maybe they cant, i dont know if they know their written exam results yet. If they dont, i bet they are still trembling.

       I am now officially Educated. The english exam wasnt very bad, but im supposing it will be a four. I didnt study at all, i dont think ill get a five.  All i have to do now is impress the public with my good looks at the festive meeting.  Yea, i understand the drop of tension everyone was speaking about now. I feel kinda buzzy. Woot.

       If all goes well, i will be a free man in a couple of hours. Well, more or less free, anyway. Free until the end of the summer, at least. The last exam will begin in less than an hour. Of course there is yet the festive meeting and whatnot but that will be easy. And hopefully, enjoyable.  So hold your fingers crossed for me. Yea, do that.

       Well then.  Got back from some nice 40 km. As a mate from the sinilille.org crew bought himself slick tires and moved some 10 km/h faster due to that, we had a pretty good average speed of 26 km/h with him leading all the way.   It felt good. As im afraid im going to have to get some slicks myself in the mid-near future, i wont be able to eat or buy new clothes or computer parts or toilet paper for the next few years or so.  And now for something completely different: I stil havent studied for my exam. Ah well. I might look a few things over. Our teachers are thinking we have been only studying for the last two weeks. Ah well for the second time.  [music: Dave Brubec - Unsquare Dance]  Another very good jazzy thing.

       Im starting to feel concern about the weather. Its got a disease or something. When came home from school, the weather was fine. And i do mean fine. Now it went away again and its raining like hell. Always happens when i want to go biking and have even organized myself a tube and all. WHY ME? Im most probably still going biking, though. You will be informed.

       Well then.  Rapid-fire posting today. Found  urlLink karupoeg 's blog. Not as in i found a random blog on the net but as in i have known him for nine years now and i got the address of his blog. Not that he has had the blog for 9 years. Yaddayadda. He has, as you can see below, also started posting in english for somewhat the same reasons as me. Yay.  As he very precisely points out:  It is good to ride your own bike. Riding some bike that is not yours is uncomfortable but on your own bike you feel like home...    He might have meant it in a different context, but still, its an universal truth and one of the fundamental facts that holds timespace together.  [music: Track 05 by Jay Chou]  I wish i knew the name of this song. As many i have highlighted in my posts, this one too, is great. Irresitible jazzy brazilian funk. Or something close to that. Aww.

       And now for something completely different:  I stopped doing nothing for a while and cooked for a change. Chicken and wok veggies. With curry and dried apricot stuff. I didnt f00k up with the spicing and in the end, it was pretty good. Okay, im being moderate. It was very good. Really. And some cake with halvah in and on it. As far as i know, the translation is right. I mean  urlLink this  stuff. A good day, it was.

       You know what...  I have done so ittle i even amaze myself with this. Even though im a lazy person, this is just amazing. I got up, maybe ate something, went to school. Got back. Sat here, did nothing. Still not doing anything. And if im not going biking i will do nothing until the evening. Then i might do a little bit of nothing before going to sleep.  One day, the future generations will read about this day in history class. The day one brave man managed to move less than a dead rock under 200 metres of earth.

       With trembling hands i am writing this entry to my blog.  Had i got a spare tube, i would be out biking. But no. Its always my bike and my tires. Everyone's inside watching football or something and the city is empty. No traffic, no nothing. The weather is fine and its a nice evening. It would be SO good to bike. I even spotted some new nice trails around the Toome hill area. Aww...  Yes, i am crazy.  [music: Kelis - Get Along With You]

       This fine morning i woke to the sound of my rear tyre going flat in the hall. wtf^^? i thought to myself. I still do. I suppose the set of inner tubes was just shitty because i already had to replace the front one. Just went flat in the hall at night, too. Is my home haunted or something? Or my bike?  Anyway, i thought i should rest during the weekend. Rest from biking, that is. After not taking any days off after that 80 km day i dont have so much spark in my legs anymore. I think a day or two of rest will fix that.  As for other things, i still feel kind of lazy. I suppose taking all those exams makes one feel like that. I dont suppose its sitting at my computer till one in the morning because one in the morning isnt really that late, considering i used to play wolf till about four or so. Or am i getting old? I dont think i have spotted any gray hairs in the mirror as of yet.  Oh, and yes, i think im going to try to install a shoutbox. So i could call myself an even more leet haxor. Or not..  [music: Fernanda Porto - Sambassim (Dj Marky Vip Mix)]  Porto is good, Dj Marky is good. So they are good together.

       Well. The clipless pedals do need some more getting used to. To say the least. Everything is okay on tricky gravel sections and forest trails (not to mention asphalt) but the northern hemisphere equivalent of jungle i happened into today isnt too comfortable to ride as of yet. As there are LOTS of broken branches and tree stumps in the foiliage (sp?) so you cant see them, you need superfast reaction times to get your leg free. At times, my reactions werent superfast enough. But don't worry, the bike is okay. I got myself some brand new wounds on the left shin. Not too bad but the towel got smeared with blood when i dried myself after the shower. Ah, more respect in the biker community anyway.  All this makes me sound really tough and masculine, doesnt it? Yay.  Edit: wanted to say we did 37 km overall. The first 10 km with a mate from the sinilille.org crew. The second part with a mate from my class. That was sort of a joyride. No disrespect, though. I was rather exhausted myself.  And now for something completely different:  I got the results for the math exam already. 37 points out of 40. That means a 5 wich is the best possible mark for those of you that might not know. I know the exercise i might have lost two points, the third remains to be seen. Its a bit sad that the mark has no practical value whatsoever. It shows how much and how well i have learned during "basic school" (really not up to looking the right term up at the moment), but still. I dont get anything for it. Yes, some girls' recieving of the Note Of Honour (translation brought to you by braindead inc.) or not. But more or less, it was a 0 or 1, on or off mark. U fail and have to retake the exam or just pass. And thats it. Feels sort of empty.  [music: LTJ Bukem - The James Bond Theme]

       So then. The exam wasnt all that bad. I think i got all the answers right. One thing i know i didnt do right, but the answer is correct. I'd explain, but i dont have any mathemathical vocabulary in english. I wish i did, though. Im hoping for 36+ points of fourty. So i'd get the best mark. I (again) guess we'll just see.   And now for something completely different: The weather isnt good. Well, it isnt bad either. But still, bad enough for some people to refuse going biking. Ah well, their choice.   Still, what about that tagboard thing? Is anyone reading this at all?  [music: Krust - Jazz Note (Total Science Mix)] As i noticed, i have lots of mixes in my playlist.

       Anyway, i was just wondering if i should add a tagboard. I dont know why they are called tagboards, i used to know them by the name of shoutboxes. They are sort of like little slow-paced chatrooms somewhere in the corner of the page. One of those you can see  urlLink here , in the bottom left (edited, was bottom right).

       I can still feel yesterday's distance in my bones. Went out for a short 25 km. Keeping 30 km/h on the speedometer was quite a struggle. At times, i didnt manage. As for the good part, i got up a rater steep wall again. Not too long but rather steep. As always, it seemed so-f00ken-steep-i-dont-know-why-i-even-tried-this in the middle of it. I managed, though.  And now for something completely different: Maths exam tomorrow. I have studied a tough 30 minutes or so. I think im probably going to add that much to it. Somewhy, i dont feel too unconfident. I guess we'll just see.  [music: The Blackbyrds - Rock Creek Park]

       Unfortunately for all the starving children in Afrika and the Middle East, i am not dead.  After a grand total of 80 kilometers done in three hours and some minutes, i can say it wasnt so bad. Instead of going to Vapramäe (The Hill of the Brave [in singular], in estonian) we went to Vooremäe (The Hill That Is On A Hump-Like Formation Of Earth [this translation brought to you by DeadBrain inc.]). That means i got f00ked with my plan to take only one bottle of water and refill it once we get there. So i had to live some 55 km on about half a litre of water. Luckily, i managed. Biking around the hill was fun. Singletrack madness. There were some bikers from  urlLink the Velo forum  around. It was rather nice to ride back in a large group.  Although i did have some problems with standing upright without the help of the walls when i was taking a shower, i am now pretty much okay.  If my joints dont sneak out of my body at night, i will do the same tomorrow.  [music: Aphrodite - Rincing Quince (Slider Mix)]

       Going to be a lots-of-biking day today. 25 done, some 50 more to do. If i dont die or something, that is. We are going to Vapramäe, if we dont die, that is, with the sinilille.org (yea, i still think that is a good name) crew. Sounds like hip-hop. We havent been to Vapramäe in a while, because it used to be too far to just bike there. We're gonna try today. 1337 pr0gr3zz 0f sk1llz.

(I dont know if that sentence makes sense or not.) I even tried to help with the code. Didnt know what to do, damn complicated css and html and whatnot. Sorry bout that.  As soon as there is actually some info in da blog, ill let u know.  Paul, still on Aphrodite wave, going out biking now. If i die, all my stuff is to be given away as charity.

Well, besides disc brakes, better shifters, a new frame, better tires and whatnot. But still. I like mine.   Okay, i admit. Im crazy.   [music: Aphrodite - Cool Flight]

       Summer is here to stay. For real. The weather today was exellent. We rode to a mates (screw apostrophes and proper punctuation in an unofficial web environment) summer house in Pangodi (writing this sentence makes me feel a bit unclear why im doing this in english, but still, its good practice), some 27 (or so they say) kms from Tartu. 2 and a half hours total ride time or so. I was riding my dads bike. Not fun.  I recently found out that a  urlLink mate  of mine is holding lectures at e-university. About philosophy. Check it out. I might take part, if i have the time.  About two songs yet another mate recently recommended -  Laroque - Goldfinger  and  Contour - Come Tomorrow  - exellent. Especially come tomorrow. When first listened to them, i thought they were too new school for me (not that i would know all that much about jungle yet). Thought that i liked Die Olde Skool jungle best. Comes out they, especially come tomorrow, cant stress that enough, are good. Very good. If you can get your hands on them, do so.

There is going to be a change of people in the class as a result of that.  And damnit, i want my bike back. Why must the damn maintenance queues be so long. As a mate pointed out, we ought to learn how to do the basic stuff ourselves. Probably will, too. We have a potential teacher, and all. The bikes are not what they used to be, you know.

       Currently blogging on mozilla firefox. (Because that damn micro$hit IE WONT log me in to blogger. Damnit, Bill, get those people to WORK.)  Just a note to people that might be interested before i go to sleep.  I screwed up the previous template. (Wich you could see  urlLink here .) Unfortunately, thinking i had safely done all backups, i overwrote the template. So i am forced to write a new one because i can't figure out what exactly i screwed up. Not to worry though,  urlLink Kaimar  sort of  urlLink inspired  me to do it again. I've decided i'm going to redesingn the template itself too. Too dark and bland, the current one. Only that i'm not sure when i'll have time to do it. Going to Hiiumaa for the weekend, that sure. So i won't be back before monday. But do push me to do it, will you? Im currently thinking of something ferrari red. Or some pastel colors. Or anything. Dotted lines, perhaps? Or a simplistic thing? I rather like the layout of Tic - Tac, the current one, so you can expect some hints from that one, too.  Just noticed firefox treats this "notepad in a browser" thing much better, too. Can't remember what it's really called. Text box, yes? Only reason i'm still using IE too is that i can configure it to take up less screen space with it's menus than firefox. And firefox isnt too friendly to flash by default. But tabbed browsing r0x.  [music: Massive Attack - Five Man Army]

        urlLink Google otsing: "agu kirss"   I googled Agu Kirss, the new gentleman to come into our class. (Im not sure if the previous is a totally brittish english gramattically correct sentence.) Seems he has kept a low profile so far. The only result doesnt even work. So we will just see what sort of gent he is, eh chaps?

       I was just wanting to post something about not having any "serious" stuff to blog about. As, for example,  urlLink Kaimar  has his people saying stuff about him and  urlLink Madli  generally Thinks of Things and then says what she has Thought. Or  urlLink Mikk  who seems to make sense only to the people very close to him. If even to them. For i, ever since i've been reading his blog, cant make much sense. I bet it's just the way he wants it to be, too. All i can do is read the blogs of all the people that know him and then try to figure out what he has been up to. Too much brain work, generally. No disrespect, Mikk. Now that i think of him, i wonder if he has done any photography lately. The ones he show me during a particular russian lesson were pretty good, actually. So if you are reading this, let me know.  Another sad thing to see is the results of the "estonian mini-blogger-boom" as i call it. Many of the blogs started are now pretty much dead. I only hope that it has something to do with summer and the fact that all normal and reasonable people, unlike me, go outside during summer. And DO stuff. I've been rather bored of late, not to count the biking. Wich is still fun. So if anyone has any ideas what to do (not that i would be _totally_ clueless), let me know.   Um, there was yet this third thing i wanted to say, but i forgot. Oh,  urlLink bother .  So, now for the main part:  An article from  urlLink Postimees online :   Kolmapäeva õhtul veidi enne kella kümmet jäi Sõpruse puiesteel tütarlaps tualeti ukse ette kukkunud jalgratta tõttu WC-sse kinni, teatas Tallinna Tuletõrje- ja Päästeamet.   Neiu oli parajasti tualetti läinud, kui esikus seisnud jalgratas pikali kukkus ja ukse sulges. Kuna tütarlaps korteriust avada ei saanud, tõid tuletõrjujad redeli ja ronisid politsei järelevalve all kolmanda korruse aknast sisse.  Päästjad tõstsid jalgratta ukse eest ära ja vabastasid lõksujäänu. Päästeameti protokollist aga ei selgu, kuidas hädasolnu abi kutsus, kas appi hüüdes või vastu toru SOS signaali koputades.    The last paragraph illustrates that even journalists can be idiots sometimes. Not to mention that most of them are idiots most of the time. Might it INSEAD of tapping morse code or flicking the toilet light or sending messages with the air freshner be that the girl just had her phone hanging around her neck as today's girls tend to do? Eh journalist, never thought of that, did you? Not everything in life is as complicated as you might think, you know.  [music: Fernando Gelbard - Alevvacolaeria]  I just spent 5 minutes trying to copy that song's title from winamp. I think i eventually succseeded. Great song, as i might have mentioned earlier.

       Its midnight.  I was just reading velo.clubbers and got an urge to bike. Gotta get those £300 lights already. Well, any lights, really. Although cruising around town would be almost just as neat. Should have gone riding today but i didnt. Although a lazy day once in a while is good too. Grr, i wish there were better mountainbike tracks near town. Really i do. All i can do now is either do the Jänese track alongside the river wich isnt so mountainbikey at all or pedal some 25 km to vapramäe. A 25km well worth it, sure, but one doesnt always have the time. Does anyone know any good tracks near Tartu?   And oh..  urlLink Thats me  at the elva marathon. I really cant tell you why the picture of me is the only rotated one.   Im actually considering going biking right now.. I doubt getting to it right now, in the middle of the night, but im going out tomorrow.

       57km.   Made some discoveries about different things today:     I am only 50 km short of being half through my second chain this season.  I now officially have more kilometrage on my bike computer than&nbsp; urlLink Lasse  has on his.   The previous means that i have ridden around 2500 km this season.  The previous aint bad for a first season.  I can now feel wind directions when biking. Somewhat useful.   And i still love the Vapramäe area. I wish it was a wee bit closer to town. The 20-25 km ride there is a tiny bit too much to be able to enjoy any decent distances there. But oh well. I really like the technical trails of the area.

          100th post. Yay.  Saw Starsky & Hutch yesterday. I pretty much agree with  urlLink Kaimar's  opinion. Pure entertainment, nothing less, nothing more. Reminded me of GTA: Vice City. A new emerging entertainment genre, i suppose. Lots of seventies eye candy and such. They had really paid attention to small details. All the minor stuff you could see in any given scene. I think they might even have overdone it a bit, but it was good nevertheless.

       67 km.  The fuzz about the starting number system of the EEC is justified indeed. Although my best result was 569th place, i got number 727. That means i had to start from the end of the line again. And that is not good at all.   Once i did get moving from the mass of people, it went pretty well. As i have said before, it was a very fast track. Very few technical sections and such and not as devilishly hilly as Haanja. Although i had hoped for a dry track, yesterday night's thunder made for some muddy sections as well. I even managed to crash over the handlebar once. Well, "crash" might not be entirely the best word to use because it wasnt so violent and fast as one might expect when one hears that word. I was trying to go through a muddy section but made a wrong decision and ended up with a front wheel stuck in the soft, sticky mud. Hovered over the handlebar and landed onto the soft mud. Not painful or damaging at all. I suggest everyone do it just as a means of reducing fear or so. Speaking of danger and damage, there was only one serious downhill. There were many fast ones but only one so steep that some people might have considered walking or climbing down. Fortunately (for me), it was behind a curve coming out of a wood. Somehow i didnt understand how deep it was before i was actually on it. Had i seen it, i might have freaked out (to use an american phrase).  All in all, it was a good fast-paced race. Im rather satisfied with my result as well. 441st place with 2 hrs 55 minutes. Proof  urlLink here .  [music: Beenie Man - Analyze This]

       Back from grandfather's birthday. I believe most of you can imagine what a grandfather's birthday is like. It was pretty good, really. I have nice relatives.  I just wanted to tell you a story i heard from granddad's sister. Greataunt the word, perhaps?   One winter evening when granddad and his sister were walking home from kindergarten (and yes, children are allowed to do that alone here, unlike some other places), his sister was looking at the moon. She noticed that the moon was moving with her so that when she was walking, the moon was moving, and when she stopped, the moon stopped. She told granddad about it. Granddad of course knew she was wrong because the moon moved with him instead. So they had to figure out wich one was right. They then conducted the first scientific experiment they ever conducted. They tried different combinations of brother moving and sister standing and vice versa. But still, they never figured it out.  It was especially funny to listen to that story looking at granddad, now a recognized maths professor and imagining he didn't know what the moon was. Just funny.   Oh yes, tomorrow is the Elva marathon. I'm going alone again. Mom and dad are taking me this time.  Its going to be a longish very fast track. Not many technical sections or anything. You will be kept posted, as always.

       Now that we got the other (look below) thing out of the way, some words about Märt's birthday i recently attended. (Ah blast, chaps, "attend" is rather a brittish word indeed, eh?)  Very nice party. Extremely nice to socialize with people for a change. And i'm not using the word "nice" just of politeness. Me really liked.  Gave him a wicked gift, too. As some of you might have heard and some not, a bunch of gentlemen i happen to know is planning, yes planning, to buy and restore an old hippie-style VW transporter bus. Yes, the old hippie sort. The hero of the day happened to be one of them. So Three Hairy Balls Productions inc., consisting of me and two other gentlemen with even longer hair, got him a toy bus, painted it, and gave it to him as a present as one might expect on the occasion of a birthday. And a nifty present it was indeed.

        urlLink Madli  writing about  urlLink death  made me think, too.   alot has been up today. today's subject is death. why do people die? i don't want them to die. there's no need to be dead before the normal death. no-one should die because of cancer or something like that. that is just so unfair. and don't come telling me that it is some "God's" will. what is he then? a psycho? why would he want to kill people? bring all this misery to the relatives and friends? i don't like him. if he exists. he is an idiot and he should know it. does he want people to die untimely just because of his own son being crucified and all? is that why he wants this all to happen?? God is probably some bitter old man sitting on a cloud and pointing his finger. that makes me re-consider the option of going to heaven after death. God should only kill those who really want to die deep in their hearts. only those and no one else.   First off, i dont know if she wrote it because of some recent events or not. But for my replying here, it doesnt really matter. Of course, i hope that she didnt. I'd hope that a person didnt die. Or have an accident or whatever.  That might seem rude, but here is what i currently think about the topic. Currently anyway:  God or no god, there is no point in being exaggeratingly sad about anyone [enter word of nasty thing that can happen to someone]. I dont think i would be. Just move on and deal with the consequences. Being sad and depressed about things, including nasty things, isn't going to help. It only makes you feel worse and really changes nothing. Thats why i don't see a reason to. Of course, NOT being sad and depressed might take some strength of will. That's why i hope i have some. So far, i think i have had. Stuff like that just happens. And there isnt much we can do to prevent it, really. I mean, in the grand scale of things. Of course we can and should make cars safer and so on and so on, but it wont stop people dying. That is just the way it is.  At any rate, i don't want people to be sad when i die. Why should i? Let the memory of me be a happy one, not sad. That is the way i treat my memories of dead people. F*ck sadness, man.  And about god being a bitter old man. If he exists, wich i personally don't know anything to think of. What about, say, love? The golden morning sun rising over the fields? Puppies and kittens? Bitter? I doupt. Balanced, i'd say.   The trick (okay, MY trick) to life is mentally blinding myself from what an ugly place the world can be and bringing the positive to the front. Otherwize, we all would go mad, would we not?  No disrespect, friends and relatives of recently deceased people. You will get over it and remember your friend. I hope the memory will bring a smile to your face every time. Otherwize, it is not a memory worth having. One gets enough bullshit all day anyway.

       30 km.  Same roads as some-days-ago. When i think of it now, i figure i shoulda' done more. Oh well. Had massive wind-against-my-riding-direction on the way back to town. And even though the sky looked like it was armageddon, we didnt get any rain. Wich is good.  As for other things (worth mentioning): Im sortof on an Aphrodite spree again. I wanted to say "damn he's good", but i dont really know if he is a she or not. In reality, it might be that im on a jungle spree in general. Only problem is i'm too lazy to bother with making a playlist in winamp. So only aphrodite for now. Later, i might switch to Kosheen or something.  If one looks at it this way, if the only other thing worth mentioning is what i'm currently listening to, my life seems dull, eh? Well, it somewhat is. Somewhat not, too.   And yes, i managed to totally screw up my template. I'll have to rebuild it from scratch. And i thought i had a good system of backing stuff up. Anyway, the more i do it, the more comfortable i become with css. And that is good. *Following text for people that know anything about making websites.* The ultimate goal for the template, wich i must build again, is to do it with no tables. I had the f**ked up template done so, too. Oh well, but it isnt a template anymore. Or if there is anyone out there that wants to help me restore it, let me know.  Oh yes, my knees hurt.   ..Life of a biker..

       50 km.  It would have been 60 but just as i was entering the town, one of my lenses got blown off. Even though i was wearing biking glasses and everything. And it was the left one, too. So that i couldnt see the road. Luckily, my mom was shopping near where i was so she picked me up.  I went to Kristjan's (a classmate) country house. Its near Pangodi, thats in somewhat-southern-estonia. Very nice hilly roads. The road there is pretty much all uphill so its really nice to come back. Spent the day doing nothing and watching Kristjan work. He was recoating the veranda (that IS a word in english, right?) with a new coat of wood proctection, eh, stuff. Oh well. Swam for the first time this summer, too.  The road there was 58 minutes to cover 28 or something kilometers. 29.1 average speed. Not too bad, i think. I dont know about the road back as i had the lense incident and all.  [music: Aphrodite - King Of The Beats]

       30 km.  Found a new gravel road near town. Never been there before. The first part was nice and quiet, but we had some good fast straights during the last kilometers. I noticed that our "banging" speed (the speed that isnt the maximum speed you can achieve on a level road but so fast that one couldnt maintain it during the whole distance) has risen from about 33 km/h to about 36. With mountainbike tires. Havent ridden with slicks for a long time. Cant say i really want to, either.

       I am now beginning to understand how the winamp equalizer works. Though im pretty sure all equalizers work sort of the same way. Nothing difficult really. Just adjust the volume for every frequency. So you can make lower frequency (bass) sounds louder and higher ones (high pitched stuff) more quiet. Or anything. Neat. I had been using the winamp Eq presets for some time now. Adjusting the stuff right does make the sound much more vibrant and lively. Experiment, people.  &nbsp;  [music: Aphrodite - 2 @ Sonictrip]   I thought i t was a 3 min piece at first.

       Sun is shining, weather is sweet.  &nbsp;  If you are wondering what i am doing here inside posting to a blog, i already got my share of sunshine today. Im not saying that i wont get any more, but still.  Went to our country house near Otepää yesterday. I went there by bike, but didnt quite cycle the whole road. At some 30 km Lasse picked me up.  &nbsp;  When i got there i realized that they had mown all the grass there was to mow and then some. Im wondering if i could ever mow so much grass in my entire life. They even seemed thrilled about the mowing. Oh well.  &nbsp;  Had a nice evening with too little chicken wok for us all.  &nbsp;  Today was biking day, of course. (Expect pictures, by the way) Only 30 km, but what sort of 30 they were... We rode around the Väike Munamägi&nbsp;area. Extremely nice single tracks, then the asphalted roller-ski track and more. Including the Tehvandi hill and ski jump tower, from the top of wich we didnt somewhy jump down.  So yes, 30 km here near Tartu or 30 km in the southern regions of Estonia can be vastly different. Remember that. I&nbsp;recommend the Tehvandi area to anyone looking for a good track or two. Or six.  &nbsp;

       80 km.  Well, the cogs are now thoroughly tested. The rear ones - the ones they changed, that is - are fine. But as they didnt change the front ones, the problems havent gone anywhere. The front ones keep making loud bang noises and throwing the chain onto the lower one or, more recently, just skipping half a turn or so.  As for the 80 km, we tested some parts of the trail of the upcoming Elva marathon. It's going to be a very fast track indeed.  Im not entirely sure, but it would seem that i have now done more than 2000km this season. Not too bad. I hope to get at least 3000. Well i do now, anyway.   And oh yes, i hate being the poor nonindependent biker of the team, whatever the costs to being independent may be. Rather indeed(That was a brittish sentence, wasnt it? If it was a sentence, that is.) I too want to be a rich leet haxor with all the money in the world. Oh well, just gotta work for it, aye?   Later added: One more thing. My biking shoes suck. Bigtime. They are very uncomfortable at long distances. My feet always go numb. Rich leet haxor problem coming into play again.  And yes, i lost two kilograms of weight. For all you people wanting to lose weight: bike 80 km a day and try to keep good speed. Think of it, after a week you'll weigh 14 kg less. Or be dead. One of the two, yes.

       Life is good. I'd say "again" but that would imply to my life having been bad, wich it in general terms hasnt.  There are, right now, two main reasons for stating the above. First, i have made some progress with the blog template, wich you should be able to see at  urlLink payl-test.blogspot.com . The main stuff is now set, all i have to do is move the text(s) into the right place(s) and do some minor modifications. And add some stuff, too.  The second reason is i got my bike back. With a new chain and new rear cogs. Silvery shiny drilled cogs. Cheap, but effective. Or so i say before any real riding. We will see, im going to test them tonight.

       I was thinking about (computer) technology and the internet and the way it has and will change our lives.  Three major thoughts at the moment.  First off, it definately has changed our lives. Today, a mate from the sinilille.org crew (do remember that all three of us have stronger-thatn-regular ties to the net scene. Especially them to. I dont work as a web desingner. Yet.?) was trying to tell us about a movie set in ancient greece. As he didnt quite remember the word for ancient he said: "you know, the time when the Times font was invented..". It took me a while to understand what he was trying to say. But understand i did. The main idea here being, i think, The serifs times has were invented because serifs enable one to chisel the font onto stone. Im not quite sure, but i think thats the theory. But his referring to an age through a font, and using the word font, is what made us laugh. But us laughing didnt make it less worthy at any angle.  Secondly, i was wondering when they will start teaching children the real alphabet that goes !"#$%&'()*+,-./:; ?@abc instead of the old and forgotten abcd.  And third: i just imagined a small boy, having just gone ghrough Basic Pen Training in second grade, picking his pen up to write his first real lines, being completely baffled when he understands his notebook doesnt render the text smaller when he closes the final > around his [font size="-2"][/font]. Expect no less when he realizes that the font command won't make his handwriting any better either.  [music: Bob Marley & The Wailers - Work]

       Actually, it's rather strange (not to use the word "queer") to switch my handlebars to a keyboard once again.  So then, where should i begin..  As you saw, i was absent from webspace for a week or so. The time at my country place (another sentence during writing wich i feel i need to know english better) was rather neat, really. Spent the time biking, mostly. As i knew, and got reassured of at my Bike Maintenance Shoppe, my chain, and most probably, the whole set of rear (and yay, maybe front) cogs need replacing. That means some 1000 kroons or 62,5 for an € conversion.  So anyway.  First off, the weather near the coast was pretty much fine all the time.  We got there at wedensday, i think. Nothing special there, just got there and went to sleep. Biked on thursday. I think i did, anyway. 50 km, yes. Rather pleasant, you could say. Not too slow either.  The area where my summer-house (damn old age vocablulary we get taught) is has lots of good forest tracks and some decent (as in not too bumpy) gravel roads. A rather decent area for biking, really. Lots of hiking bikers or whatnot too. The sort that ride around those no good for nothing bikes loaded with tents and sleeping bags and whatnot. No disrespect, trip-bikers.  On friday i biked with my mother. Wich, if you look at it as a biker wanting serious riding, is not a very wize decision if you have the least bit of respect towards your mother. And i happen to have some. So only 30 km. I said "only" because it took us quite a lot of time to cover that distance. Had i done it myself or with the sinilille.org crew, it might have been serious training.  On saturday, that being yesterday, now that i think of it, we went biking with the sinilille.org crew who had arrived on friday evening. 100 km of nice tracks. With an average of some 25 km/h. Not too bad, i say. The ride was mighty fine. Forest trails and gravel roads. Rather scenic at places. Visited most of the sights there were to see near the summer house. The weather was exellent, too. Most of the time, anyway. As the script of any hollywood movie says, we got some rain too. Im not quite sure what i wanted to say with that sentence, but i thought it would sound cool. Anyway, the last 20 km we rode in heavy rain. Well, the last 15 anyway. During the last 5 it didnt rain but it didnt matter anyway because we were all wet. I think my biking shoes arent quite dry even as of now.  Today we decided not to bike because biking in wet shoes is discomforting to say the least. I won't say the worst because your monitor would'nt display it anyway because of it's magical ability to censor words that are so, uhm, uncatholic that they would blow your brains out. And we don't want your pretty brains all over that nice wall, do we? Okay, im getting carried away again.  We decided to visit Haapsalu, a seaside resort town, on our way to Tartu. We had a long walk around town and saw (that meaning climbing on and inside) the railway museum. Check pictures.  When coming back from Haapsalu, we happened onto another peculiar sight. To say the very least. You see, there was a nice Volvo (wich, in a state not so nice anymore, you can see in the gallery as well) with german licence plates driving all over the road. He was swinging from one side of the lane to the other. When that had been going on for 4 km or so, we started wondering if we should call the police. And then the volvo just drifted into the opposite lane, estonian roads having two lanes different from the chech tradition of four and the molvanian of three, and, as one could expect from a car driving in the opposite lane, collided into another one. The other one happened to be a green van (gallery time again) filled with a family of motocross bikers and their bike(s). As the speeds were within the speed limit, although im not quite sure how that could happen on an estonian road as no BMW with an estonian licence _ever_ drives within the limit and 99% of the cars here ARE BMW's, the crash wasnt too bad. But it wasnt a parking bump either. We stopped the car, calmed the panicking girl in our car, and looked around. Nobody had been severely injured. Wich one might not conclude from the gallery, now that i think of it. We waited some 30 minutes for the police to arrive and then told them what we had seen. That took some 2 hours. Not the telling nor the waiting but the sum of the two. But a picture is always better than words, so do check the gallery, link for wich will be supplied later.   Check gallery  urlLink here . People featured in the gallery are mainly me, the other fellows from the sinilille.org crew and some friends and relations. Not to mention too many names in fear of the unexisting internet criminals and perverts and whatnot. The first part of the gallery, the one that has the bloody knife and such, are actually pictures from a happening i did not attend. It just so happened that the camera and memory card did and they got uploaded into the same place.

        Due to problems with my net connection, this entry is a little late.  So then. Im still alive.  About the marathon, then: First off, we got there in time. That is worth mentioning. As another note, i was the only one from the sinilille.org crew that actually took part. The others were there though, as we went by Lasse's car and another mate was there too.  So i got my number from the registration and went into the starting corridor while having previously warmed up and everything. I noticed a peculiar gentleman. first off, he had no helmet. What initially caught my attention, though, was his bike. It was a woman's city bike. As practical for such a marathon as a wheelbarrow would be. As i feared, he turned out to be tough competition. Somewhy, most people with the silliest ever possible bikes do. He had a water bottle hung over his shoulder with a string.  So yes, the track was pretty muddy at places, and even worse most of the time. I noticed that most of the people, many with bikes and equipment many times the value of mine, walked up slopes i just rode up. I walked in the beginning too, but i noticed it is faster to pedal slowly with an easy gear. Also less straining on the legs. And that, on such a long distance, matters.  The first 10 or so kilometers were for breaking up the 1000 people into smaller groups. So in the beginning, one just waits and waits and tries to get by people at every opportunity. From 10 to 20 i just rode sortof normally. 20 till 40 were the golden times. I only passed and passed people. I sill remember the expression of a gentleman riding a bianchi (expensive and good bike manufacturer) frame when i passed him. His eyes were as big as saucers. From 40 to 50 was normal again. And then came the last 5 kilometers. Those killed me. I was getting tired, but, i think at least, the biggest problem were the new riding pants i had never tried before. They turned out to be too tight in a rather specific place, wich, especially to a male rider, is not nice. Not nice at all. I suppose i lost some 50 places during the last 3 km. But still, i finished and managed not to cry or faint, although barely.  Henceforth the morale: do not go on a long race with equipment you have never tried before.  Before the race, there was some fuss about the track being too difficult for the average sunday rider. Well, i had no problems with it. Only that less mud would have been nice. But then again, i might not be an average sunday ride anymore. Basically, i liked the track. Straining, but nice. Very technical. I like technical tracks.  While i was racing, my support crew, that is Lasse, Kristi and Tõnis, went and got themselves a place to sit and count the riders next to the track. They found a sauna or some small house on a slope the track was coming up. The climb was after the muddiest downhill of the entire track. As much as they told me, there werent many people who didnt crash. No wonder, too. I managed to stay on the bike somehow. But in 15 centimeters of mud on a downhill, it wasnt easy. I sort of came down the hill half-sideways. Lasse and Tõnis took pictures.  It took me 3 hours 37 minutes 32.7 seconds to negotiate the 56 kms. Started as the 768 th rider, finished as the 569 th. 21st in my own age group.  And another nice episode from the race: During the first 10 km or so, i lent my pump to a fellow rider in trouble. He had bought himself a high-tech gas container powered pump but didnt know how to use it. I gave him the pump, took his phone number and rode on. When i finished and called him, he had already started for home in his car. As he lived in Tallinn and was passing through Tartu, we agreed that he would leave the pump in a gas station. When i went to get my pump i also got a beer, his way of saying thanks. Woot.  See the pictures Lasse took  urlLink here . Im number 768.

       Im back from the SAAB meet. As it was sort of the warm-up evening, there werent too many cars and people there. Despite that, it was a nice evening. SAAB owners are generally very friendly and nice people. And of course, the ride to the north coast and back with the sinilille.org crew was nice too. To those of you that might have been reading the blog for some time now, id like to add that, even though sinilille.org is basically a biking "team", we went by car. SAAB doesnt manufacture bikes as far as i know, because if they did , i would have one.  We had amateur-style drag racing competitions and everything. A 400 meter strip competition and then some people tested their cars for maximum speed that the conditions allowed. Check the pictures for spidometer shots. We were able to do all that racing because the meet was held at a former russian military airfield wich had a 2.5 km landing strip. Some people had maps wich were produced during the russian times and the airfield, as expected, wasnt on it. Just a patch of forest on the map.  Check out the pictures  urlLink here .

       54 km.  As all my riding clothes were yet to be washed from yesterday's mud fest, i had to wear usual shorts and a t-shirt. What was worse, i had to wear normal "sports socks". Now, dont think of me as a spoilt child, but the "normal" socks, added to by the yet damp shoes i had forgotten to put on the radiator, were awful. They squeesed my feet so the blood couldnt circulate and my feet felt like being compressed in high-pressure absorbent cotton. Thats about how it felt, yes. So it was a very uncomfortable ride.  Before today, i would never have believed that a proper outfit can make such a difference.  Oh yes, and i did watch football. I was just staring at the clock in the upper left corner of the screen, wondering if the additional time should already end or not, when the damn greek scored the goal. So i only saw the replay. Oh well. As the ones that know me in real life might know, im not really interested in football. But i was sort of promised food so i went along to some friends' place and watched it. They have a bigger TV anyway. Oh, and yes, i noticed i got my cable tv feed back. So im no longer cut out from the world of toothpaste commercials and mexican soap operas. Yay, what a relief. As far as i am concerned, television is rather, and becoming more so every day due to broadband, pointless. At least i can control the ads i get and do something to fight them on the net. Yaddayadda blah blah. Point is, as a medium of information exchange, the net pwns. (Owns, that is, wich means to be above any competition, basically.) As a medium of entertainment, its catching up to the TV.

       47 km.  Asphalt/gravel roads. We had a Lasse's old classmate as a guest star. Nothing more to say, really.  Got myself a new helmet, partly because there is a lamp on the old one, partly because the old one was sortof falling apart. The plastic parts, i mean. The whatever-o-foam seems to be okay.  Ah yes, i got my hands on "Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl" yesterday. Unfortunately, the show consisted of their old sketches mostly. It had some new parts in it, but not much. So it wasnt as fun as i expected it to be.

       16 km.  There's definately a WOW factor to nightriding. Lots of shouts and smiles while riding past people. Maybe it's because of the cool lightning. BUT maybe its because i look like a teletubby and lasse looks like Mickey Mouse. Either way, we get lots of attention.  Rode 16 km at Toomemägi. I would have done more but Lasse had to work and i didnt want to ride alone. It was raining, too.  Anyway, my bike is still f*cked. As my experiences tell me, the problem disappears for about a hundred kilometers after maintenance. Then it comes back. The chain won't stay where it's supposed to. I can sort of anticipate the problem by now but it's still not fun if you can't use a third of your gears. Why cant i be rich or there be bike-communism in estonia?   But as far as the lightning system is concerned, everything seems to be okay. Rather shock- and weatherproof, it seems. Even without any extra casing.

       No kilometers yet. That's about to change, i think.  Got up early as hell and went to Tallinn with dad. Spent half a day getting myself a pair of trousers and a shirt and hanging around while dad was doing business.   Anyway. Lasse built himself a bike lightning system with two lights. Im not saying one isnt enough, though. But still. That man is going to make me shoot myself one day.  As the thunderstorm that i thought was going to rip my roof off seems to have passed, im off for some riding. Like drugz, i would suppose. Give a finger and it takes a hand. Well, only second time so far but still.   So off i go, maybe a late-night post later when im drawing the new blog-template.   For now, over and out.

       70 km.  My odometer is now at exactly 2111.1 km.  We did the 60 track for the Tartu Rattaralli first. Sinilille.org crew minus T and A instead of him (still being paranoid, as you can see). Nothing special. Fast asphalt race all the way. I happened to have slicks on because my MTB tyres are in trouble at the moment. I will need to get my pump fixed or if its not possible, get a new one. Having slicks (tyres sortof like the ones one finds under a real racing bike and not a mountain bike) made me a lot faster than the others. Wich was good and bad. But enough of that.  I am now the proud owner and co-author of the invention of the year 04. We built a bike light. For a long time we (i) had wanted a good ligntning system. The ordinary bike lights they sell at shops are not an option. The ones they sell here or over the internet are expensive as hell. The one we built costs about 300 kr or 19 eur. Thats about the cost of a normal bike light, now that i think of it. If my calculations are correct, that is about a tenth of the cost of a similiar-powered system one can get over the internet.  The system consists of a battery, a switch, the bulb, wires and stuff that hold the bulb and wires. Really easy to build. The battery is kept in a backpack, the switch sits in a pocket of the backpack, the wire runs up your back and onto the helmet where the light is. Wonderful :) We tested it and it works like a charm. Lasse tells me it's even weatherproof. I suppose we are to see about that.  And it is good for getting looks, too.   Ah, invention of the year indeed. Well, not technically an invention, but still.  Im really happy about it. Nightriding is wicked.  Oh well, of to tallinn really early tomorrow morning so i'd better go now.  EDIT:   urlLink Pics  of the system.

       So what did i do this wonderful day?  Nothing much. Got myself yet anoter Brand New Tube and repaired an old one.  Had lunch at grandma's. Had a walk and lunch with mom. Dont think bad of me because of that, will you.  That wasnt a long list at all, was it?  As for other matters, Lasse's and K's (being paranoid and not using names when possible as people somewhy do at blogs) child is to be born sometime soon. Completely normal, that. For the first time today i thought that my grandmother is going to be a great-grandmother so somebody. Wicked. Along the theme, i was figuring that the age when children will be taught reading and writing is going to get earlier and earlier in our society. Learn google at three and photoshop at four. I imagine Lasse trying to explain what a book is to his kid. "You know, like toilet paper, but with a font on it."   Just a sidenote. Im still burned. I had to walk 2 km with a backpack today. Not nice at all. I had chosen a shirt with the wrong sort of fabric that rubbed really bad. Henceforth the morale: dont suntan for too long at a time.

       38 km.  Back from the country, all sunburned. As it always happens to me, my rear tyre started going flat just at the right moment. I managed to ride on saturday but with a tire in the middle of going flat. As one might expect, it takes a lot more effort to move a bike with a flattish tire. But it was sort of fun because i got to ride upright for a long distance (because one can put more power to the pedals that way) and that kept the speed up. Fun.  I had planned to do 100 km on sunday but the tyre was flat. As it tends to happen to me, my pump is broken, too. And i didnt feel like going into the village looking for a pump either. You'll never know what the locals might be up to.  Instead of biking, i went to the beach. Now my legs are red and a little stingy.  [music: Aphrodite - I Got Five On It]

       Im not going to write any biking kilometers here because the number is so small it isnt worth mentioning.  But durin the short distance i learned a couple of things. My bike is fucked. Oh, bother, now is the time i wish i knew english bike-vocabulary. I wont fall into very detailed descriptions of whats wrong. Fact is i couldnt ride up the hill where the toy museum used to be at toomemägi. And it's not a very "bad" hill comparing it to some others i have done. I dont want to imagine what would have happened when i would have gone to Väike Munamägi with my bike in this state.  The bike is now being repaired and due to that i won't be able to ride tomorrow. Damnit. Im wondering if they will have it fixed. I hope so. Totally lost motivation today. Well, motivation concerning the current bike, anyway.  Also checked some bike lights. Comes out that im still better off building something myself or ordering something from the internet than just buying a set of normal bike lights and rechargable batteries.  For the good side of today, i got a sports bag i had needed for a long time. Lasse keeps calling me an official sponsor of H2O.

       There has been some discussion about a public letter by a gentleman named Märt Sults. Until now i had only read all the response to his article, but as i seem to have lost the newspaper the letter was published in, i only wondered what all the fuss was about and then just forgot about it for a little while. Now  urlLink Kaimar  pointed me (although not personally) to a link of the  urlLink article itself .  Now i understand what the fuss is about. Rightly is it said the man should be fired. His thoughts are outdated by some 50 years. Maybe it is he who should be isolated from society?  I believe everybody has the right to do what the hell ever they want. As they don't deny anyone else their constitutional rights during doing it, of course. If two gay people want to live with eachother, who can stop them? Why should they be stopped. The reasons Sults brings are silly. At least from my point of view. First off, he speaks of preserving the species. That is definately not a problem. Look at China, India and the middle east. What Sults really wants to do is to preserve us, estonians, isn't it? Personally, i dont give a damn if our nation(ality) dies out peacefully. Im not saying that if someone attacks us we should not defend ourselves or anything of that sort. Im saying that if the number of estonians decreases in thousands every year but the total number of people on this planet increases in millions, there isnt much we can do about it. Or much we should do. I understand the government's efforts to increase births. And i favor it. But i see no problem in estonians as a nation becoming extinct if it happens peacefully and not through someone's use of force. The major point (to me) would be mankind as a whole surviving. I dont really care what cultures it is made up of as long as they all get along well.  Or where does Sults take it that mankind should be preserved. I see no specific reason for that either. I mean, if it happens so that in the future people don't want to have children, what of it. So if the last human dies peacefully under an apple-tree watching a golden sunset. I see no problem with it as long as it is not against mankinds will. Although i do not suppose that will ever happen because people generally want to live.  As i mentioned, Sults' ideas about isolating gay people are outdated. And i personally think that gay people are all right.  Theoretically, should mankind die because all the people are gay, so what. The gay people would know mankind is going to die and they would accept it.   But all the above is not my major point. What i mean is although we have freedom of speach (speech? wich way was it?) he is still proposing hostile action towards people. A person like that, as many people before me have said, should not be allowed to run a school. His letter is so full of stupid ideas and facts taken from nowhere that i cant rightly imagine how he got to be a headmaster in the first place.

       20 km.  I now consider myself one of those that have had a near death experience. Mildly exaggerating, that. I didnt even get a scratch, but dont laugh. Well, to tell the story from the beginning or try at least.  Yesterday we found a pretty good place to practice jumps and stairs on bikes. Not far from where i live and otherwize quite good. So we practiced there yesterday. There i had the jump i previously mentioned.  There are two pretty nice flights of stairs there. One of them is usable very well, the other ends up on the pedestrian path and near big traffic. But othewrize they are just the same so it isnt a problem because we can use the safe one. Previously we had only practiced going down it, but even yesterday i wanted to go up the flight. There were small sections consisting of 3 steps wich i got up nicely yesterday so i supposed that the 10 or a bit less step flight isnt too bad either. Although the theoretical techniques for getting up those differ somewhat, i won't discuss them because it wouldnt do any good.  I gathered some speed and got up the flight with no problem. Adding a bit of spice to the thing was the fact that i undid my pedal clips because falling sideways down onto a concrete stair isnt nice. And the pedal is pretty small and when one has to use the middle narrow part of the shoe because that is the part that WONT stick to the pedal going up a stair at high speed is rather interesting. It shook, let's just say.  So i get up and all is well. After some random practicing (if one can call it that)i decided to do the stair again. I line myself up for the uh, whats the word, "speed gathering". (Can anyone tell me the real word for "hoovõtt"?) As you might figure, gathering speed causes the pedals to be applied more power than during just cruising. As i have learned today and even before today, my bike has problems with that. You see, the chain tends to "slip" or come off the front chainrings if i apply too much power. Unfortunately, i did. So just a metre or so before the first step my chain comes off the front cog. As i happened to be applying pressure to get the best possible speed, i was leaning on the pedal quite furiously. The chain came off causing the pedal to lose any resistance from the rear wheel. That meant i lost balance and i had to support myself with the arms. To say the least, i wasnt in full control of the bike. And that can and does have lethal effects. As mentioned before, all i had between me and the beginning of the stairs was a metre or so of asphalt. As i quickly figured, hitting the first stair with the speed i was travelling would have been lethal (mildly exaggerating) to me and my bike. All i had to do was to reduce the speed as much as possible during the metre. That in turn meant vigorous usage of both brakes. And you do know what happens when one uses the front brake too vigorously, dont you? Not to mention that i had my centre of weight rather foward. So yes, as one would expect, i flew over the handlebars. Very luckily, i somehow managed to land on my feet or something. Not a scratch.   BUT.  Had it been some 50 cm later i would have landed sraight onto the concrete at full speed. Im not too keen on trying to figure out what would have happened to me in that case. Trust me.  I didnt lose the wanting to bike or anything, but i did lose trust in my bike.  (Just as a side note: Using Comic Sans Serif on an actual product sold at shops does not show the designer in the best light. Not when it isnt done professionally. And the product im holding isnt. I cant tell you what product it is because then some real designer person could come and tell me that it ISNT comic sans serif supposing i have made a mistake. Oh, okay, it is a bottle of "värska" water. It is comic sans serif on the descriptive text in different languages, isnt it?)

       I arrived two minutes after the hairdresser's closing time. Oh, bother.  Just wanted to add some recent thoughts about biking (and dont tell me you didnt see that coming).  First off, the deore hubs i got from lasse seem to roll better than the previous ones. I dont know if it just seems or if there is any real stuff behind the sensation.  And second. During the past two days, i have made huge leaps in confidence as far as biking goes. Doing stuff that might seem dangerous, that is. I think it's a matter of self-motivation, really.   And now for something completely different:  I noticed that the pile of empty plasic bottles in my room is self-sustaining. If that is the correct word. Or self sufficient. What i mean is that when there was a huge pile of bottles on the floor so that i could hardly move around with my chair. (For my chair is pretty much the only thing i move around with in my room.)  Then the pile disappeared. When i started writing this i thought that i had no idea how it had disappeared and suspected mom or grandmother of it. But now i remembered that i had actually taken all the bottles away myself. Anyway. As soon as i take them away, they start piling up again. Hardly a week has passed and there are already three here. I just looked at the bottles and they sort of laid there in such a way that i fear they might eat me during the night. When i stop blogging out of the blue, you know what has happened to me.   And another thing. I have noticed that the ironic style of writing  has come rather common (in blogs and other places). It hasnt always been so. I might have wanted to use the style myself but right now it seems so mainstream i have absolutely no desire to be ironic. I was just thinking of finding some examples of ironic bloggers, but i will do that later. When i spot some, wich i probably will, i will try to remember to bring the example.  With the ironic style i mean the you know, ironic to be funny style. Maybe a tiny bit like Terry Pratchett's writing here and there. The people who keep an eye on the blogosphere will probably know what i'm trying to say.   And speaking of writing, i have wanted to write something for a long time now. It's just that i have had no specific inspiration as of now. Nobody has really pissed me off in a long while. No specific reason to write anything either.   Should i?

       20 km.  More goofing. Me likes. Going to bike more later today. I even managed to cruise down a little hill-thingie (wich didnt seem that innocent while i was doing it). The "bombhole" near the lung clinic, if anyone cares. Probably not.  Heading out to get my hair cut right now. Uf all goes well, i WILL have them cut. So we will see.

       20 km.  Just goofed around, basically. Jänese track and back to town via the Tartu - Tallinn "highway" currently under construction. Then did some stair climbing/unclimbing. And then there was the jump. I managed to jump, yes. Something i previously thought impossible at my level of biking morale. Thanks to Lasse, who kept disrespecting me until i jumped. Had he not been there, i woulda done it in half the time i did it or not done it at all.   And oh, im not getting the camera because the gentlemen at the US photo shop decided to NOT give a discount after all. Or something like that. So my relative didnt buy the camera and is coming back with nothing. Just to mention, he wasnt in the US only to buy the cam. I'll have to figure out another way now. Stupid american fucks. (I bet that as soon as i publish this post i'll have CIA or FBI or both knocking at my door. As a positive side, i ll probably be getting tons of hits from the islamic countries. All due to the sentence above. Well, it isnt technically a sentence, because it doesnt have a verb in it. Oh bother.)

       Alles rites.  Back from Hiiumaa. It was a good trip, i suppose. Consisted of the things one might usually do when one is in Hiiumaa (did i get the preposition right?). Aviation show on saturday, boat trip to saaremaa on sunday. That's pretty much it too. Good company. Oyea, we cooked lots, too. That usually happens when my father is around. He takes that stuff rather seriously. Not that i wouldnnt like cooking myself. As for the weekend, we had it so that he prepared the stuff and i grilled what needed grilling. Beef on saturday, two (not one, mind you) ducks on sunday. One duck roasted, the other grilled. I dont generally like duck and this was no different. It was edible, but duck has a specific taste i dont like. Just like liver.   I will probably post some pictures later, when i get my hellos and picasas reinstalled.  [music: Drumagic - Easy Boom]  First (and possibly best) piece from a d'n'b album i have. Well worth listening.
