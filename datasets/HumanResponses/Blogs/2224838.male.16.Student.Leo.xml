       I just got back from Columbus after staying a couple of days at my grandparents house. It went a little something like this: On Thursday morning my family and I left for Columbus, arriving around 1:30 to eat lunch with our relatives at my grandparents church. After allowing time for dessert and digestion, seven of us went out into the frigid afternoon air and fought through a competitive football game that ended in a good-humored no win/no loss sort of deal at sunset. The following afternoon we went with our aunt, uncle, and one of our cousins to see  urlLink  Elf   in Joplin, Missouri. After the movie we decided to kill some time at Best Buy and the mall, and we successfully departed without buying anything except the  urlLink Relient K  CD. For the remainder of the night and the following day we spent time with our grandparents, leaving after lunch today. A good time was had by all...

       Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I'm about to leave for Columbus, KS with my family to see my relatives, eat turkey, play football, and be thankful for all of it. I hope that everyone has a rad day with whatever they are doing. I'll be back on Saturday!

        urlLink Visual Diaries : This is the web-site of Cary Conover, a free-lance photographer whom I met and interviewed at the Flint Hills journalism workshop over the summer. He is a graduate of both Wichita Southeast High School and Kansas State University, and he is currently a free-lance photographer in New York. He has a talent for documenting people, so be sure to check out some of his photographs.

       For some reason I have forgotten to mention anything about  FLCL , the film club that I'm in at school.  FLCL  stands for  Film Language Critique League , but the people who made the name for the club took the initials from an anime series (FuriKuri). Basically, the club meets every other week to watch and discuss a different film. So far, we have watched   urlLink THX 1138  ,   urlLink Amelie  ,   urlLink Dr. Strangelove  , and currently,  urlLink  Grave of the Fireflies  . Mostly, the same seven or so people come to the club on a regular basis, but lately we have been growing. I know, I'm a dork for being in a film club, but the club allows me to see movies that I wouldn't normally get to see, and I have become increasingly interested in filmmaking.   I will now post the links to the movies that I have recently seen, both inside and outside the club, under the "now playing" section of my sidebar. Plus, as you may have already noticed, I am putting a different movie quote at the top of my blog each week.

       I guess since I'm a junior I am supposed to start looking at what I want to do after high school; college, trade school, work, etc. There are so many things that I could do, but I haven't pinpointed what I am supposed to do. I have invested much of my time in high school to journalism and photography, but I need to decide if those are the things that I want to do for the rest of my life. I know that if I have enough desire to do something, there should be nothing to stop me. Right now the only thing stopping me is myself.  Man.. they really need to add the comment feature to Blogger.

       Last night I finally watched a movie that has long eluded me:  urlLink  Pulp Fiction  . This came not a moment too late; nearly ten years after the movie's release. After watching it, I realized that I had actually seen most of it already, just not all at once. As far as the movie goes, it was just as I expected: awesome!

       We just got new  urlLink Apple iMacs  for the journalism room at school. Slap some wheels on them and they look like something straight out of  Star Wars . I'm not really that fond or even familiar with Macs, for that matter, but I have been learning more about them while working on the newspaper this year. I don't know that I would ever want to own one myself, but there are some pretty cool things about them. As an added bonus with the iMacs, Apple sent a few copies of none other than Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. I think my addiction to the game has quickly worn off, but I have a feeling that there won't be much work going on for a while.  On a different topic, my journalism advisor received an advanced screening copy of the movie  urlLink  Shattered Glass  . It's about a journalist from the  New Republic  who fabricated most of his stories and ended up paying the price. Since it's related to journalism, my advisor may let us watch it in class sometime.

       I went to see   urlLink Mystic River   last night with my family&#8212the one thing that I really did on my day off. Overall it was a very suspenseful, grievous movie with equally amazing performances from all of the actors. Not too often does a movie have me so emotionally connected with the story and characters and&#8212in this case&#8212truly sitting on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend that everyone go see it.

       I'm addicted... to  urlLink  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4  . It seems that every time I find a game I like, I have to play it non-stop until I finish. Once I have finished the game I haven't really gotten anything out of it accept the enjoyment that I had while playing. Video games consume so much of my time because I have nothing else that I would rather spend time doing right now. If I had some form of constructive hobby I would not waste several hours a day on video games. For some reason I have had trouble taking interest in much outside of school. While my junior year should offer me a endless supply of things to do, without some sort of escape I will tire quickly. So while I am striving to get the last 30 pro points of  THPS4 , maybe I can come up with something more constructive to do than playing video games...

       As planned, I went to see  urlLink  The Matrix Revolutions   this morning at 11am, and I gave myself some time to let it to sink in. Although many people are already passing it off as a disappointment, just as they did with  urlLink  Reloaded  , I still enjoyed many aspects of  Revolutions . While  urlLink  The Matrix   is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy--mostly because it introduced the story without the complications of the sequels--this movie successfully concluded the trilogy. In a basic sense, it was a good movie, and people who have followed the first two will want to see it.

       It looks like I will be going to see   urlLink The Matrix Revolutions   tomorrow at 11am with my brothers and my friend Brandon. This means that I will be missing school--most likely all day. I try to avoid missing school as much as possible, and I'm not quite sure if I should miss for a movie, but... it's the Matrix! Hopefully I won't miss anything too important at school. I can just pretend that I am preparing for optional classes in college.

       These are a couple of quizzes that my brother found on  urlLink Quizilla . I'm not too sure about the movie quiz... it must be bugged. Here are my results for the two quizzes:   urlLink Which Muppet are you?      You are Kermit the Frog!! You are loyal to your friends and don't really know how to say No. No matter what you were doing, you would drop it in a second if a loved one was in trouble. You are also a born star.

       Although it took me 11 days to make it to the theater, I finally went to see   urlLink The Return of the King   today. This part of the story definitely carries the most emotional value because it ties the character development from the first two parts. In this way, The Lord of the Rings has more value as one story rather than three. Since I've read the book it's hard for me to believe that the trilogy is actually concluded. I feel like re-reading the book a few more times to get a better view of each part. In my opinion, both the movie and book are classics.

       Since Nate finally decided to end all of the complaining about his lack of a comment feature, I hopped on the wagon right with him. Although the comment feature is not yet built into Blogger, it was easy to add it at  urlLink HaloScan.com  within a matter of a minutes. For anyone else that uses Blogger and wants to join the commenting "fun," go ahead!

       I hope that everyone had a great Christmas day. As for me, I had an awesome day and received far more than I deserved. Probably the coolest thing that I got was a  urlLink Canon AE-1 Program  camera system with two zoom lenses. I should really have fun learning how to use it. I've crossed out everything that I got from my  urlLink Christmas wishlist  below, but I got many things that were not on there. Again, I want to thank my family for a great day together. Special thanks to my mom for all of the awesome food. Mmm...turkey...

       I can't believe that he did it again... Nate went to see yet another Lord of the Rings movie behind my back while in Manhattan. I don't think I can ever forgive him. Well, at least I have read the books already and I know what happens!   UPDATE:  You know I was just kidding too, right Nate? Oh, except for the part about having read the books and knowing what happens. It's not too late to ruin it for you. In a way I was kind of wishing you had seen it, so the thing about a guy puking behind you could be true. I guess I should give you credit though. That was a pretty good  urlLink trick  you pulled there.

       Before this year I did not realize how difficult it is to produce a newspaper--even a small, monthly school newspaper. Although the publication at my school could be much better--and I have seen better from other area schools--I am, nevertheless, proud to be part of the production. Hopefully with my experience from this year, I can personally improve while aiding the newspaper along the way. I just find news writing far more difficult than any other journalistic writing, especially in high school. Seriously, what significant news is there in a Wichita high school?

       I forgot to mention yesterday that I was temporarily kicked out of school because I had not had my tetanus/diphtheria vaccination. I guess that my previous doctor had not sent my records over to my current doctor and I was thought to have the vaccination already. Since I was not allowed to be in school without a vaccination, I went to the doctor and got one. I hope everyone is glad now that I won't give them tetanus or diphtheria.

       Today I finished reading  Catch-22  by Joseph Heller. The story is set during WWII on the fictional island of Pianosa, following the lives of a group of American soldiers. I really enjoyed the story and themes of the book and, most of all, the dialogue which was hilarious and cleverly woven together. Although it is lengthy and difficult to follow at times, the characters shine through and add an addictive touch. It is quite possibly my new favorite book.

But on the bright side, I have been to nine percent of the United States!     Now, here is a map of states that my dad has visited, in sharp contrast with mine. It seems that my dad went all over the place in his youth.

        Although I have not even seen a majority of the films and television shows that are nominated for  urlLink Golden Globes  this year, I have decided to give my uneducated predictions anyway. These predictions are simply what I think will win, not necessarily what I want to win. I have omitted some of the categories that I have absolutely no idea about to lighten the load.    Best Drama   Mystic River   [Lost]         Best Actress in a Drama   Charlize Theron - Monster   [Won]    Best Actor in Drama   Sean Penn - Mystic River   [Won]    Best Musical or Comedy   Lost In Translation   [Won]    Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy   Scarlett Johansson - Lost In Translation   [Lost]    Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy   Bill Murray - Lost In Translation   [Won]    Best Supporting Actress   Hope Davis - American Splendor   [Lost]    Best Supporting Actor   Tim Robins - Mystic River   [Won]    Best Director   Peter Jackson - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   [Won]    Best Screenplay   Jim Sheridan - In America   [Lost]    Best Television Drama   Nip/Tuck   [Lost]    Best Television Musical or Comedy   Monk   [Lost]    Best Actor in a Television Musical or Comedy   Tony Shaloub - Monk   [Lost]   The Golden Globes will air tomorrow night at 7:00 p.m. Central on NBC.   UPDATE: I was way off!   Well, as you can see above, I didn't do too well with my predictions.  I went 6 for 13 overall in the categories that I made predictions for. Next year I will try to actually see most of the movies and television shows that are nominated before making predictions.    urlLink Golden Globe awards winners 2004

       Ahh, there's nothing like late Christmas presents to  brighten your day. For me, it's  urlLink The Man with No Name Trilogy  from my brother, Nate, and sister, Lindsey. This was one of the DVD's that I wanted most for Christmas, and it has finally arrived. Since my brother and sister didn't have this to give me on Christmas, they compensated for its absence with a  Fight Club  poster. If late gifts mean getting something extra in turn, then I'm always up for late gifts. Thanks Nate and Lindsey!

       No not the movie... I've been feeling like I'm going from day to day in very dazed fashion. Each day has gone by in a blink, and second semester has already come. I know that I need to progress in school, but it doesn't feel like I'm getting anywhere outside of school. What I need is a project to slow the time, if that makes any sense. Then maybe I can step back and make some serious decisions about my future.    I need to wake up. But before that I need to go to bed.

       According to  urlLink IMDB  and a few articles I've read, director  urlLink Michel Gondry  invented the time freeze technique known as "bullet time" before it was used in  The Matrix . He first used the technique in a Smirnoff commercial in 1996--a few years before  The Matrix --and later in a Bjork video. Both are featured on the Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD that Nate  urlLink recently bought . This guy is awesome.

       Although it is somehow difficult for my family to follow through with plans to see a movie, we managed to see   urlLink Big Fish   at the  urlLink Warren  tonight.  For those who haven't seen the trailer, Big Fish focuses on the relationship between a father, who tells his life story as a string of tall tales, and his son, who is only looking for the truth about his father's life. What I found to be cool about the movie was the larger than life feel it had, as if there were no limits to the size of the stories. Just like any other Tim Burton movie, it had a pleasantly strange look and feel. Furthermore, the cast was awesome, including people like Ewan McGregor, Danny Devito, and strangely enough, Steve Buscemi.

       These are the four proposed designs for the 2005 Kansas commemorative quarters, submitted to The Mint for review. Before an official quarter design is chosen, it must go through a  urlLink nine-stage evaluation process . According to an article I read in  The Wichita Eagle , Kansas high school students will vote for their favorite design in April of next year for the state's final decision.

       After 29 days of Oscar on Turner Classic (viewer's choice will continue for another two days), the Academy Awards will air tonight on ABC at 7:30 p.m. Central, with Billy Chrystal hosting for only the eighth time.  urlLink  The Wichita Eagle   put on an Oscar prediction contest, which I entered despite my horrible performance with the Golden Globes. These were my predictions for the contest:   Picture:   urlLink  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King    Director:   urlLink Peter Jackson   Actor:   urlLink Bill Murray   Actress:   urlLink Charlize Theron   Supporting Actor:   urlLink Tim Robbins   Supporting Actress:   urlLink Shohreh Aghdashloo   Animated Feature:   urlLink  Finding Nemo    Original Screenplay:   urlLink  Lost In Translation    Adapted Screenplay:   urlLink  Mystic River    Song:  "Into the West"  If you have nothing better to do like me, make sure to watch.   UPDATE:   The Lord of the Rings  swept the Oscars, winning all 11 of it's nominations, and tying for most Oscar wins ever with  Ben-Hur  and  Titanic . I didn't do too bad on my predicitons, as I was only wrong in three categories: actor, supporting actress, and adapted screenplay. I'm guessing that even three is too many to miss and win the contest.   urlLink Oscar Night: Winners List

It's just a little hard to come up with a movie, find a poster image, and change the link each day. Now I can simply change the movie whenever I want. In addition to this change, I will now keep an archive of every featured movie which you can view by clicking the link below the current featured movie. This way I will never forget whether I have used a certain movie before, and people can revisit past movies.

       I know I've never met  urlLink Yugo  before, but since he is a friend of my brother's and I read his blog frequently I added a link to it on my sidebar under "Friends & Family." He makes pretty interesting posts on his Xanga page, "Seven Day Weekend," even though Xanga is inferior to Blogger.

       Although I was aware of its existence already, I just re-discovered the "Suggest a Movie" feature on the Turner Classic Movies site, so I began requesting movies left and right. For the movies that were already scheduled to play I simply clicked on the "remind me" button so TCM will e-mail me one week before, as well as one day before the movie airs. This way, I should never forget to catch a movie I want to see again. While I was there I also signed up to  urlLink become a member of TCM . Now I will receive e-mail newsletters and monthly TCM schedules. I should have done this much sooner.

       I really don't know what to think of this... The school board has banned Washburn University recruiters from visiting Wichita schools due to the controversy surrounding  urlLink this statue . Is it really anti-Catholic? I admit, it's not a very flattering statue for this particular bishop, but I don't think it's trying to attack Catholicism. It's all in the eye of the beholder, just as  The Passion of the Christ .   urlLink Schools' ban on Washburn affects little

        I just wanted to mention that the movie  urlLink  Matchstick Men   was released on DVD today and I highly recommend it. All of the actors in the movie, including Nicolas Cage, Alison Lohman, and Sam Rockwell, give outstanding performances. Everyone should go out and buy it.   urlLink Roger Ebert's review / ****

       It's finally my time to post about  urlLink  The Passion of the Christ  , as  it may be the most controversial film of my time. It seems that everyone whose views actually matter to me have said that this film is simply awesome. Here is a little sample of what some prominent figures have said:  If ever there was a film with the correct title, that film is Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of the Christ.' ... It is the most violent film I have ever seen.   - Roger Ebert , in  urlLink his review      It is a powerful and important film, helmed by a man with a sincere heart and a warrior's sense of justice. It is a story filled with searing images and ultimately a message of redemption and hope. ... It also might just be the greatest cinematic version of the greatest story ever told.    - Richard Roeper , in  urlLink his commentary     "Gibson's movie is not for everybody.  But if you see it, you may wonder why Gibson himself has been so brutally attacked. His apparent sin is being faithful to the gospels and wanting people to imitate the compassionate philosophy of Jesus. Now if that's a bad thing, we have truly lost our way."   - Bill O'Reilly , in  urlLink his talking points     From what I gather, this should be a very significant film; one which I am very interested in seeing. As for my thoughts, I simply recommend that those who are interested in the movie go see it and form a personal opinion.

       Although it's kind of an oxymoron,  urlLink My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiancé  was actually a pretty good reality show. The first few episodes were really funny and then, of course, the last couple became very tense and drawn out. I thought the actor that played the big, fat, obnoxious fiancé did a great job of being big, fat, and obnoxious, and at the end, explaining the whole situation to the girl's family. If you haven't seen the show, just be like Nate and try to download all of the episodes. It's actually quite good.

       Today I participated in the  urlLink Kansas Scholastic Press Association  regional contest at Wichita State University. I competed in three categories, including infographics, newspaper design, and news writing. Both infographics and news writing were carry-in categories, which allowed me to work on designs using given information beforehand and turn them in on the day of the contest. My entries for the carry-ins were much easier to plan and create because I had about a month to make them. As for the news writing, which I had to work on within a one-hour time limit today, I did not do as well.   Suprisingly, the results of the contest were already available this afternoon, placing me second in infographics and awarding me honorable mention for newspaper design. So much for news writing I guess, but then again, it doesn't matter. I qualified for state competition with infographics and newspaper design, but I won't actually be going to Kansas University to compete because those are both carry-in categories. I will simply complete two new entries next month and send them in on May 1.  As for the rest of the people from my school, one guy placed first in yearbook copy writing and second in yearbook theme development along with another guy, and a girl received honorable mention for headline writing. The majority of the categories were dominated by Wichita East High School, but luckily Kapaun Mt. Carmel didn't win as much as usual.

       Today my grandpa turns an amazing 81 years old. It's interesting to think of all the things he may have experienced in his lifetime; from the Depression of the 1930's to the present. I'm sure that he would like me to acknowledge that he shares a birthday with Michael Jordan, which he often mentions around his birthday.   Happy birthday grandpa!

        I guess since millions of people celebrate this holiday every year by exchanging candy, flowers, and gifts, it's probably important to know the  urlLink history of Valentine's Day , as well as the most true act of love, the  urlLink St. Valentine's Day Massacre . As true with most holidays, people usually don't know the history behind the day. It's pretty interesting to see exactly how each holiday was established, as well as some of the beliefs behind them.  I don't have a Valentine today, so will you be my Valentine? (no dudes)

She has supported me every day of my life. She's just cool like that. Happy birthday mom! I'll let you have a corner piece of the cake.  P.S.

       I can't believe it... I nearly lost hope, in fact. One of the greatest movie trilogies ever,  Star Wars , is finally going to be  urlLink released on DVD  this fall. It's set to be released on September 21, 2004 in a special four-disc set. Star Wars geeks everywhere have already found something to complain about: the possibility that the original theatrical versions would not be released. Lucasfilm has quickly appeased them, though, by agreeing to realease those as well. This would make the  urlLink star wars kid  proud.     The Star Wars Trilogy:    urlLink Episode IV: A New Hope     urlLink Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back     urlLink Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

        I finally made the switch to the  urlLink Opera  internet browser today after a long run with Internet Explorer. I actually don't know how to use many of the features it has, so it should take me some time to get used to. There are many cool features in it such as the "undo close page" feature, as well as weird ones like  urlLink mouse gestures . All in all, Opera should be much better to work with than Internet Explorer.

       This first week of February has been same-old, same-old... Except that I missed a couple days of school due to some back pain that I was having for a while. A muscle strain it seems--whatever.  I got a chance to see   urlLink Bringing Out the Dead   again. The first time I saw it was around five years ago when it was fairly new. At the time I didn't know that it was a Martin Scorsese film, but I guess that shouldn't change anything anyway. It's very different, sometimes unsettling, but I like its style. Basically the movie is three nights in the life of a burnt out paramedic who is haunted by the memories of people he was unable to save.  The fact that there is not really a plot supports the fact that the character's life has no direction; it's just an endless series of the horror he witnesses.   Directly after the ending of that movie I went to see the Farrelly brother's newest movie,   urlLink Stuck On You  . It's probably one of my favorite Farrelly movies at this point. I liked the way that they explored the bond of brotherhood and embraced people's disabilities rather than rejecting them. It was, of course, very funny, but also kind-hearted in its approach.

       You may have noticed a few minor changes on my blog; the title, the sidebar appearance, the date, the item titles, the links effects, and the sidebar links, to name a few. It took me about an hour to sort through my mess of code, but I think I like the changes overall, and I'll try as hard as I can to keep them around for a while. Now that I'm satisfied, it would be nice if all two or three of my loyal readers could give me some feedback of some sort in the comments. This way I will know just how soon to start changing everything again. Also, you can include some of your favorite links, blogs, or movies, and I will check them out. If I like them enough I'll slap them on the sidebar as well.  Holla!

       I have finally caught up with a few movies in this past week that I have been meaning to see. Among these movies were   urlLink Lost in Translation   and   urlLink American Splendor  , both of which Nate ripped off of the internet.   Lost in Translation , with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, is about two people who meet each other while in Tokyo, and fall into conversation and a close friendship. They're both lost in a foreign country, as well as in their marriages and careers, which is the basis for the story. The movie is full of awkward comedy, and covers issues which everyone can relate to. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson were great in it and, of course, Zach was first to insert how beautiful Scarlett Johansson is...  The second movie,  American Splendor , tells the true story of Harvey Pekar, a file clerk who turned his everyday life into a successful comic book. The comics are genuine and funny simply because they show that we all fight daily battles. The movie deals not only with real and fictional characters, but even with the way they are presented. There are documentary scenes, fictional scenes, and then scenes illustrated as comic books, with the drawings sometimes moving into reality or back again. This was definitely one of the most unique movies, in terms of presentation, I have seen lately.

       StreetSentz, an organization started by RadioShack to promote child safety from abduction, is running a contest for high school students. To enter you must create a script and storyboard for a 30 second public service announcement to educate children about "protectiong themselves from abduction, violence, and exploitation." The winner will fly to Hollywood and work with a team of film professionals to produce his concept into an actual 30-second spot. In addition, that writer will receive a $5,000 cash prize, as well as $2,000 for his teacher and $1,000 for the school.   $5,000? Film professionals? That's enough incentive for me to give it a shot.

       I have known for a long time now that my blog doesn't exactly look too hot in most browsers, but I now realize that I seriously need to reconfigure my CSS. By looking at sites such as  urlLink SimpleBits  and  urlLink A List Apart , I can see that some major changes can be made that might fix some of the problems that have boggled me for a while. I don't know why I really care so much about it because I am not a professional web designer, but it just bothers me a bit. So hopefully, sometime in the near future, I can make some changes for the better. I say "in the future" because I just tried to make a slight change in the CSS and the result looked as if it would take a lot more time than I have to spare.

        Maybe I'm a little bit behind on my pop culture news here, but if you've heard of William Hung, you have to wonder, just as I do, how he actually  urlLink landed a record deal , and in addition to this big record deal, how he has already made a music video. He is amusing, and I am happy for him, but the public is just making a big joke of him now.  Think of the gimmicks that  American Idol  must use that lead to things like this. They must purposely let a few "bad acts" slip through the preliminary auditions just to have some people that their judges can make fun of on the show. Otherwise, people like William Hung would not make it on the show in the first place. This is probably the reason that I avoid watching the show. That, and the fact that I just don't care who wins.   Anyway, whatever happens with his career, I just hope that William Hung doesn't allow himself to become a big joke to all of the people trying to make money off of him because he actually seems genuine and innocent.

       It's spring of my junior year and the mail from colleges is flooding in every day. I have already replied to many of the colleges that have mailed me, but there are so many of them that I still have no idea where I should go.  Here are the schools that I have received information from:  American University   Arcadia University   The Art Institutes   Avila University   Baker University   Calvin College   College of Santa Fe   Colorado College   Illonois Wesleyan University   Kansas State University   Loyola University Chicago   New York University   Rochester Institute of Technology   Southern Methodist University   University of Kansas   University of Miami   University of Minnesota   University of Missouri Columbia   University of Nebraska   University of Rochester   University of Southern California   University of Washington   Vassar College   Washington University in St. Louis   Colleges in the  urlLink PC&U Magazine    + More  As you can see, there are so many schools that I have looked at, and even more that I haven't looked at, that it's difficult to even know what's good. Another aspect that I have hardly considered yet is just how expensive some of these schools will be. Most of them are so far away that it will be hard to make a campus visit if I'm actually interested.

        How happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd.  -Alexander Pope     urlLink  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   shows the significance of memories in life through an unlikely couple, Joel (Jim Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet), and their experiences with trying to erase their relationship from existence. I've already mentioned this movie a few times in recent posts, but tonight I was able to go see it for myself. The story is told, not in chronological order, but through an assortment of memories in no particular order at all. As Joel quickly loses every last memory of his relationship with Clementine, he rediscovers his passion for her and desperately tries to hide some fragment of her in the recesses of his mind. "Eternal Sunshine" is a collaboration of both Michel Gondry and Charlie Kaufman, who together create an awesome story and visual experience. It is another great dramatic role for Jim Carrey, just as in  urlLink  The Majestic  , which many people overlook. This is just one of those movies that gets caught in your mind, rolling around and producing new questions, which in my opinion, makes it great.

       On Friday, I went to another show at the Eagle's Lodge with bands: threefoundonewounded, The Green Fuse, Kelpie, Ricky Fitts, and The Great Redneck Hope. threefoundonewounded was awesome again, but when Nick, the guitar player, tried to do a guitar throw, his strap-locks gave out and his axe plumeted to the floor. It was a horrible sight. The next band, The Green Fuse, was...different, to say the least. Kelpie brought in a soothing vibe, with a sort of soft rock sound like the Strokes. Then, unextpectedly, Ricky Fitts and The Great Redneck Hope set up directly across from each other and held a sort of duel, with everyone in the place completely encircling them. I can't exactly say who won, but let me just tell you that the whole thing involved partial-nudity, indie rock, grind-core, sweat, moshing, and a few technical difficulties.     I finally made it to church this morning after about a month of absence. The service that I go to with my family is called  urlLink Breakthru , which is basically a later service with a more casual atmosphere. Although I didn't really get into the praise music as far as singing goes, hearing it made me realize that I need to start playing my guitar again. Then I could jam with my brother, on bass, for the first time. My brother gives me crap for letting my guitar sit idly by, collecting dust. He's right to give me crap though... Music can be an awesome thing for me, if I would just devote a little time to it.

        Happy  urlLink St. Patrick's Day  everyone! Or, Beannachtai na Feile Padraig, I should say.

Pronunciation:  guh dock-tah on dee-veal two  Meaning:  May the devil choke you!   Phrase:  Dun do bheal!  Pronunciation:  duin duh vale  Meaning:  Shut your mouth!  (This one's for Darian)  Phrase:  Ta me air meisce   Pronunciation:  Thaw may air mesh/kah  Meaning:  I am drunk  (This one is just kind of funny)  Phrase:  An bhfuil bean sa chistin?  Pronunciation:  On will ban sa khish-tin?  Meaning:  Is there a woman in the kitchen?

       I found this interesting article on  urlLink cinematography.com , which is an excellent site for any news or resources about cinematography. Although the article is heavy with technical terms, the basis of the article&#8212that science may be closing in on a perfect lens&#8212is pretty awesome. Imagine being able to focus on details smaller than the wavelength of light. Even more, the possibilities that this kind of technology open are nearly endless, applying to things such as increasing storage of CDs and DVDs and increasing the number of circuits on computer chips.

       This is from one of  urlLink Nate 's old school assignments that my dad found today. It's from 1992, so he would have been 11 at the time.  I would like to be a rap singer because it would be fun. I could spread God's word and get money for it. I want to be a very strong Christian and lead many people to Christ.   Sometimes I get left out of things because I'm such a strong Christian. But I won't quit.  I wonder what happened to Nate's aspirations to be a rapper. He could have called himself M.C. NatoriousFAT. It's pretty cool that he was focused on his Christianity when he was 11. He seems to be staying true with it today, so that's cool.  P.S. I have free reign to make fun of Nate right now because he's out of town. He will probably get me back when he comes home.

        urlLink Michel Gondry , an awesome and innovative French director ( Human Nature ,  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ), announced that his next feature film,  urlLink  The Science of Sleep  , will focus on "conquering your dreams."  “There's a guy who commits murder in his dream but with an electric shaver. An electric shaver becomes huge and shaves everything in sight," Gondry told in the interview.  It seems fitting that he would be making a feature film of this nature because he has adapted many of his own dreams into some of his best music videos (Björk, Foo Fighters, Chemical Brothers). Make sure to watch out for this movie sometime later this year. Also, check out Michel Gondry's latest movie,  urlLink  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  , in theaters Friday.

       I just spent about 14 hours at school. Eight hours of regular classes, an hour or so working on my social studies demonstration after school, and around 5 hours working on the next issue of the school newspaper. Even after the five hours of working on the newspaper, I'm still not done with my section, and it has to be ready by the end of school tomorrow. (This can probably be attributed to the fact that half of the time I'm there, I'm talking and eating junk food.)  But even though it sounds like I'm complaining, I actually enjoy "paste-up" nights for the newspaper. ("Paste-up" refers to the construction of a newspaper, without the use of computers, by literally pasting the stories and photos on the pages.) For some reason I tend to be particularly funny while I'm working on the newspaper. Somehow I feed off of the conversation around me and make humorous remarks in return.

       Darian discovered this media production team who used a  urlLink homemade Mini35 kit  to shoot their short film  urlLink  Marla  . The kit uses a MiniDV camera, but shoots through a traditional 35mm SLR to achieve a film look without the high cost. This makes me wonder if there is some type of mount that would allow you to directly attach SLR lenses to a DV camera.   The setup looks like this:    Nate said that when he gets a MiniDV camera he's going to use my Canon AE-1 to create his own homemade Mini35. I guess this means when he does this, I can use his camera in return.

        urlLink  Confessions of a Dangerous Mind   &#8211 I thought this one was pretty good for George Clooney's directorial debut. The movie effectively uses bright pop images in contrast with the dark backgrounds the story is set in. Although I'm not too convinced that Chuck Barris really worked for the CIA, it is, nonetheless, an interesting story. Pretty much everything in the movie was good, but I just wish they wouldn't show Sam Rockwell naked so much.   urlLink  Runaway Jury   &#8211 I'm not too sure about this one. It does seem to be heavily influenced by political views on gun control. Nate seemed to be agitated by it more than I was. It does bring up a few good points about the court system, however, but I really didn't find it to be that great of a movie otherwise.   urlLink  Starsky & Hutch   &#8211 This one has some great laughs and I really like the Stiller/Wilson duo as Starsky and Hutch. Anyone that likes their kind of humor should see it. "Do it, do it."

       I just thought I would update everyone on what I've been doing lately for the sake of actually making this blog somewhat about me.   School:  More than eight hours of my day are taken-up by school, so I guess I could say that's what I've been occupying myself with. Here's my schedule&#8212by the way&#8212followed by what I am currently doing in the class.   Tuesday/Thursday   AP U.S. History II: Social Studies Performance Demonstration. I chose to argue that journalism of the late 19th and early 20th century had great influence on American politics, foreign policy, and social reform.   English III: Tomorrow I will be taking the state reading assessment.   Spanish: Preparing a Spanish weather forecast that I will present to the class with a partner. ¡Ay, bendito!     Newspaper: Racing the quick deadlines for the next paper. My article: Barbara Mohney set to retire after 13 years as principal      Wednesday/Friday   Creative Photography II: Panoramic photo sequence.   Seminar: Study and sleep.   Precalculas/Trigonometry: Beginning a chapter on "analytic trigonometry."   Chemistry: Discussing temperature, pressure, and volume.    Monday   All classes   At home:  I've been getting a whole load of brochures and such from colleges ranging from Southern Methodist University to New York University. Just recently I discarded most of the "blah, blah, blah" letters as I went online and requested more information from the schools I'm actually interested in. Other than that, I've been messing around with my camera a bit, reading  The Fountainhead  by Ayn Rand, and basically waiting on spring break to come around. Just a little over a week to go!

       Here are a couple interesting news clips from  urlLink IMDB news .   Kidman Considering Narnia Movie?   Hollywood superstar  urlLink Nicole Kidman  is one of the actresses said to be up for the role of the White Witch in a new movie version of CS Lewis' classic children's novel  urlLink The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe . According to press reports from Australia and New Zealand, Kidman flew last week to New Zealand to scout out locations for the upcoming Disney adaptation of the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, and was said to have taken a tour of Canterbury's high country via helicopter and met with the crew. Walt Disney chairman Richard Cook recently said of the movie - which is due to start filming in Auckland later this year - "It's a very, very ambitious project and one that we believe could be very important to the studio.   Caviezel Under Protection    urlLink The Passion Of The Christ  star  urlLink James Caviezel  is being protected by a security team from attack by religious fanatics following his performance as Jesus Christ in the  urlLink Mel Gibson  movie. Studio bosses are concerned that zealots will attack Caviezel for his role in the controversial film and have hired a 'protection squad.' A furious mob have already screamed 'anti-Semite' and hurled a bucket of lamb's blood at Oscar-winning actor and director Gibson in a New York street. A studio source tells British tabloid newspaper Daily Star On Sunday, "There are some crazy people out there and everything is being done to protect Mel and Jim from physical attack." Caviezel, a devout Catholic, says, "Of course I'm scared that someone could get it in his head to make me a target. But I won't let this stop me doing my business. I'm an actor, helping to promote a movie I truly believe in.

        It's been noted as intriguing, addicting, and even a bit unnerving . . .  I was surprised at how many of these individual logo letters I could recognize. It just goes to show how effective company logos can be. Certain letters are more recognizable than others, so there were quite a few that I had to think about. Eventually I was able to get all of the 4th edition letters on my own, but I haven't gone through the older editions. The only thing is, the guy who created the game will only give you 4th edition answers at a hefty price--$8 per letter! Now there's a little encouragement to guess them on your own. (If anyone wants the answers I can post them in the comments)  Thanks to Darian for the link

       Alright, I finally sorted out the sidebar link-effects. Since my brother has been too busy to help me, and since he had to leave for work before I could ask him tonight, I eventually found the answer to my problem by looking at Darian's style sheet using the CSS sidebar in Firefox (probably its main advantage). I found that I needed to use "display: block" to obtain the effect that I wanted, much like the one Darian uses for his side menu. Thanks for the unconscious help Darian.   I also added my friend, Brandon, to my weblogs section again because he finally posted something after about four months (I wasn't even aware that he had a girlfriend). I doubt he will post much again soon, but he is my best friend so he is worthy of the list. Also new to the sidebar is the "MISC. SITES" section, under which there is currently one site. But it's a good site, so check it out.  Elsewhere &#8211 Today I submitted my two entries for the  urlLink Kansas Scholastic Press Association  state competition, which I mentioned in a  urlLink past post . Since both entries were carry-ins, I will not be going with the others to the University of Kansas tomorrow (not that I wanted to anyway). I think both entries turned out very well, so I can only hope that I will place with one of the two. If I do happen to place, I will be awarded &#8211 what else? &#8211 a shiny new medal. For some reason, it doesn't exactly seem fitting for a journalism contest. It seems that a plaque, or perhaps a fancy certificate would be fitting, but who am I to complain? I could just flaunt my nice little medal in front of some athletes.  By the way, the great hockey action of the NHL playoffs, and Darian's encouragement on his blog, has ignited an urge inside of me to play hockey. I don't know if that will really ever happen, but it's a thought at least.

       When I changed the channel to Turner Classic Movies yesterday while watching TV, I noticed that  Doctor Zhivago  was just about to begin. Since it's one of those classic movies that every movie lover should see, I decided to watch it. After about two hours of the movie, just as I was thinking that it was about to end, the screen displayed "INTERMISSION." It would only be an hour and a half more until the movie was finally over.   Anyway, after dedicating so much time to a movie (I guess it's just as long as LOTR), I was glad that it was all worthwhile. It was a great depiction of the Bolshevik revolution, and it taught me much that I didn't know. Something that I didn't understand, however, was why TCM decided to show three David Lean movies, back-to-back, spanning approximately three hours each. Who, beside my brothers, would really be able to watch  Lawrence of Arabia  at three in the morning.

Unless I subscribed to the magazine in my sleep, or I filled out something on the internet that automatically subscribed me, then I have no recollection of ever doing so. When I received the first bill for this several months ago, I asked my dad if I should just cancel it or email them, but he said "No, I'll take care of it."

       Today in newspaper lab, the staff voted for the two top editor positions for next year: managing editor and editor-in-chief. Basically, editor-in-chief oversees the entire newspaper staff, while managing editor takes care of the writing staff and focuses on editing the stories.   Although I was only planning on running for managing editor, I went ahead and threw my name on the editor-in-chief list. I wasn't really trying to get that spot, so I voted for someone else. Anyway, the guy I voted for ended up winning, so the staff next voted for managing editor. Two other people were running for the position alongside me, so it was a trying campaign. It took ten long minutes of graft and vote rigging, but I emerged the victor.    My responsibilities as managing editor start this week with planning the staff and newspaper for next year.

       National Law Day is not until May 1, however, today I attended a Law Day luncheon put on by the Wichita Bar Association. The special speaker at the luncheon was Cheryl Brown-Henderson, the daughter of Oliver L. Brown, a plaintiff in  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka . She spoke about the myths of the case, its effects on the country, and the continuation of desegregating our school system. Her address raised a good question: Are schools in this country still segregated today? Not necessarily in a literal sense, but in the way students continue to live within their own racial groups.   After the luncheon, students broke-up into discussion groups and participated in a student symposium. Some questions asked within the groups were:   How is segregation within your school?  How would your education be different without  Brown v. Board ?  Can separate ever be equal?  How are changing demographics in our community affecting your school?  What can you do to help desegregate schools?  I don't think any law can be implemented that can change the way people mix socially. It's all up to the person to decide if he wants to make friends with someone of another race. For some inexplicable reason, people just seem to flock to others of their own race, as if they can identify with them as they could not with someone of another race. It's probably more important to educate people on multicultural education than it is to force diversity in schools through some kind of quota policy (which I discovered that USD 259 uses).   Such diversity policies are even moving into universities through affirmative action. I still don't understand how affirmative action is making anything more equal. Why can't schools simply look at each individual in the same light, and judge them purely on whatever qualifications they would under normal circumstances?  Answer me these questions three, or however many I asked in this post.

       I'm sure that many of you have seen the movie  urlLink  Catch Me If You Can  , based on the true story of Frank W. Abagnale. Well, today I finished reading the book of the same title, written by the man himself twenty years before the movie was released. Abagnale comments in the afterword of the book that the movie is actually eighty-percent truth, changing his family structure, omitting impersonations and prison time, and changing the times and locations of some events.   If you're not familiar with the story, Frank Abagnale was one of the most daring con men, forgers, impostors, and escape artists in history. During his criminal career, Abagnale posed as a co-pilot for Pan-Am using a fake ID and pilot's license, impersonated a pediatrician at a hospital, practiced law and assisted the district attorney of Georgia without a license, passed himself off as a sociology professor at Brigham Young University, and passed over $2.5 million in phony checks, all before the age of twenty-one.   What's truly amazing, however, is how Abagnale was able to reform himself after his life of crime, turning his talent for forging checks into a business, and becoming a legitimate millionaire on his own. It's one of those stranger-than-fiction stories that you still can't believe after you read it.

       After arriving home from a 14 hour day at school yesterday, I found that my ACT scores had come in the mail and that my entire family somehow knew my scores before I did. That's just not right. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised by my results.  There are 36 points possible in each main category and 18 points possible in each sub-category. The rank in parenthesis indicates what percentage of students scored at or below my score.  Here's the breakdown of my scores:   English:  34 (99) Usage/Mechanics: 17 (99) Rhetorical Skills: 18 (99)   Mathematics:  27 (89) Pre-Algebra/Elementary Algebra: 14 (84) Algebra/Coordinate Geometry: 14 (93) Plane Geometry/Trigonometry: 14 (91)    Reading:  28 (87) Social Studies/Sciences: 11 (60) Arts/Literature: 18 (99)   Science Reasoning:  25 (86)   Composite Score:  29 (95)  Although my composite score is good enough to get some sort of scholarship, I think that, given some time to study, I can raise my scores in science, reading, and math, and maybe bump my composite score up one or two points.

       I saw  urlLink  Kill Bill Vol. 2   the other night with my brothers. I think I liked it even more than volume one. It's not a sequel, but the second half of the story set up in volume one (although it can stand on its own). Volume two has much more dialogue than the first, but I don't think it slows the story down at all. Although the dialogue may sound unnatural, it helps to develop the characters as they were not in the first half. As for the action sequences, the setting is much more confined and on a much smaller scale than in the first part. Nonetheless, the action is very fast-paced, well choreographed, and bloody. Together, the two parts make for a great story, full of unmatched action and gore, and comic-book style characters.   Make sure to stay through all of the credits. Not only should you see all of the people who worked on this movie, but there is also a nice little clip at the end.

       This has been the longest week that I can remember. I have been sick with some sort of a sinus infection for over a week, so I am just now getting over it. Yesterday I finally broke down and stayed home to make sure that I didn't carry this stuff into the weekend or next week, yet my brother still seems to think that I'm faking for some reason.   At school I actually went ahead and tried to run for senior student council (or dance committee) representative for no reason whatsoever. I guess I just thought I needed some sort of leadership experience that would be good on applications and the like, but that shouldn't be a reason to do anything. The election was today, so I guess I'll see how I did on Monday. In my Precalculas/Trigonometry class I recently took perhaps the most difficult test this year (analytical trigonometry), and despite my lack of studying and my complete disorientation due to illness, I somehow scored a 95% (second highest in the class). It's sort of ironic how I received my best test score on the most difficult test of the year, and under less than ideal circumstances nonetheless.  Throughout the week I have been meddling in some various photography projects, both for school and with my personal camera at home. First, as I previously mentioned, I borrowed a Lomo Compact-Automat camera from school and shot a roll of color slide film for a class project, as well as a roll of color film for myself. Nate also went out and shot a roll of color and B&W film because he has been eager to experiment with a Lomo ever since he heard of them a while back. My color slide film turned out surprisingly well for my first use with the camera, but for some reason the images didn't have too much of a vignetting effect (darkening of the edges)  as I have seen in most of the Lomo photographs online. Nate and I are still waiting for our other rolls of film to be processed.   My other photo project was with my Canon telephoto lens that I had not previously experimented with. The prints from that little test also came out surprisingly well. Hopefully I will be able to put together a photoblog sometime in the next year so I can share some of my photographs, but I guess until then I can get a head-start on the whole deal by compiling as many images as possible.  Now that the weekend has finally come around I will hopefully get some rest, and possibly go see  urlLink  Kill Bill Vol. 2   with my brothers. I'll probably also continue watching some of the NHL playoff games, as I have been doing over this past week with my family. Although I haven't really picked a team that I want to win, I can't pass up the chance to see such great games. My dad was trying to make plans to go see a production of "Godspell" this weekend, but he quickly found out that it wasn't exactly the same version of the play that he is familiar with, so he decided to cancel the whole deal.

       I finally finished reading  The Fountainhead  yesterday. It seems that this book was Ayn Rand's first presentation of her original philosophy, known as Objectivism, which created controversy when the book was first published in 1943. I had already read another book by her,  The Anthem , last year after I found it sitting around the house one day. It was short enough that I decided to read it purely out of curiosity. Just as  The Fountainhead , the book dealt with the importance of the individual.    The Fountainhead  is about an architect, Howard Roark, his battle against conventional standards, and his love affair with a woman who struggled to defeat him. Roark is shown as the ideal man because of his talent, courage, and struggle to remain true to himself. He believes that "individual creators are the fountainhead of civilization." Every one of the novel's main characters struggles to act independently, and the desire to do so becomes the greatest quality a character can possess. The author basically illustrates that society has a dependent mentality, and individuals must act selfishly in order to be free.   Although I don't agree with some of the ideas that I found in the book, it still makes many great points and forces you to think about how dependent our society can be.

       Today I discovered that my photography teacher had recently procured five  urlLink Lomo cameras , one of which he allowed me to borrow for the weekend. Lomo cameras are manufactured by a small company in Russia, and only in Russia, but they have become somewhat of an underground sensation for photographers. I have been wanting to try one of these out for a while, and now I have a chance to experiment with one for myself. Nate even wants to get in on the lomo-action, so we are going to get some pointers from  urlLink The lomographic Society International  before doing some experimentation of our own.

       Lately I have been experimenting with my telephoto lens, as I have been meaning to do so for a while. Since it's spring, there are many new opportunities for macro photos with the small, furry animals, flowers, grass, new-born life, and all that great stuff. I just love that kind of crap.  Also, I have been moving along at a snail's pace reading  The Fountainhead . Anyone read it before? It's such an interesting book and I enjoy reading it, but I want nothing more than to be finished with it already. (You may remember that I mentioned the book about two weeks ago. I thought I would be finished by now.) I actually started reading it so I could write an essay about it for a scholarship. I'm not too sure if that will be happening, but if I have enough time I will give it a go.  That's all I really have to say about that... So for now, I leave you with this question:  How goes the go-going?

       This morning I took the  urlLink ACT  (American College Testing) assessment from 8 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.. (You know, the assessment that tests everything that you were supposed to have learned in high school and is a large factor for college selection.) Although I had planned to prepare for this test months in advance, I didn't get around to reviewing until only of couple weeks ago. Somehow my planning turned into procrastination, so it didn't do much good.  Although I'm confident that I did well on the English and reading portions of the test, I'm not so sure about the math and science. In fact, I barely had time to finish those parts.  The time given for those parts allows for less than one minute per question, and that just won't suiffice on nearly half of the questions. I can only hope that my poor performance in those areas won't make my score plumet into oblivion. I'll just have to wait four to seven weeks for the results. I hope that I passed at least.  If not, then I guess I have next year. I better start studying...

       On Monday, I went to the senior graduation to hand out programs at the door, and luckily I didn't have to miss the commencement. Just watching all of the seniors get their diplomas made me look forward to next year. Not only do I look forward to graduation, but I'm also excited about all of the things that I get to do as a senior. Yeah, that's pretty sappy.  My school year came to a close today, as I took my first and last final in Precalc/Trig. Luckily, I pulled through with an A on the test and an A in the class. Along with the A that I got on my chemistry test on Tuesday, I now have a 4.0 GPA for this semester, which was completely unexpected. I seriously thought that I would get at least one B this semester, but somehow I saved myself at the last minute.  On another note, my photo teacher let me borrow a Lomo LC-A for the summer so I can test it out and decide if I want to focus on Lomo for my portfolio next year. I'm surprised that he would trust me with it for the whole summer. I think I'll go sell it on eBay.  I guess I don't have any exciting plans for the summer, now that it's here. I'm basically just taking a government class, looking for a job, doing some volunteer work, and hopefully visiting a few colleges. In between all of that, I'm going to sleep as much as possible.

       Darren Doane, perhaps the best of punk rock and hardcore music video directors, recently launched his site. The site is cool because it includes information about the equipment and editing techniques that he uses to make all of his music videos and movies. It seems as though he is completely willing to answer any questions that people ask in the discussion board as well. That's pretty cool if you ask me.   Anyway, if you haven't seen any of his videos before, then be sure to check some of them out in the "VIDEOS" section. You're also supposed to able to buy his DVD  urlLink "XDOANEX" at Best Buy , but my brother hasn't been able to find it in the store as of yet.

        Twenty years ago, on May 16, 1984, most of the world believed that we had lost a comedic legend forever. This has turned out to be what will inevitably be known as the greatest comic prank ever conceived. Andy Kaufman, by all accounts, is alive and well at age 55 and is now living in New York City on the upper west side.   urlLink Yahoo! News Press Release   Somehow, this bit of news slipped past me for the past two days, and now that I have heard it, I really don't know whether to believe it or not. The only news site that has released a story on this so far is Yahoo! News, but I can't say that it is the most reputable site. If it is true though, then this is definitely the best prank that I have ever heard of. I truly believed that Andy Kaufman was dead, but I wouldn't put it past him to do something as crazy as faking his death for 20 years.  Anyway, whether you believe it or not right now, "Andy Kaufman" has  urlLink launched a blog , of all things, to update the world on his return and his experiences during his 20 years in hiding.

       The  urlLink Film Language Critique League , a school club of which I am a member, concluded the school year today with  Hearts of Darkness . Sadly, I was the only student watching the movie with the club sponsor, a teacher. The small group of students who made up the club are all seniors, and today was their last day. Being the only student watching the movie, I am now determined to revamp the club next year by promoting it more and setting up some better activities. It would be great to plan some trips to a theater, and I think that would at least draw some people in. Also, (although I'm not too sure it will work) I am going to write to some companies over the summer to see if I can somehow get some DVDs for the club "library." I'm just hoping that someone will see the merit in supporting a student film club.

       Today, for my first visit to the Kansas capital city of Topeka, I went to the opening of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site with my history teacher and three classmates. Basically, Monroe Elementary School in Topeka has been renovated and converted into a museum to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, which declared that segregation of public schools is unequal and unconstitutional.  The site was dedicated by remarks from about twenty dignitaries, ranging from senators to NAACP officials. The prominent attendee was none other than the president himself, George W. Bush. When I told my family about this event a couple of weeks ago, they instantly began saying that I was going to meet the president, but that was not the case. In fact, I was about 200 feet from the podium, so I was nowhere near him.   Despite being so far away, and having to stand in the blistering heat surrounded by 4,000 people for several hours, it was still a great experience. I took some good, but far off, photos of the president, Air Force One, and Secret Service agents (which I will try to post tomorrow), and I was able to hear some great speakers.  The odd thing about today was that I didn't even get to go inside of the school, but hopefully I will be able to go back to Topeka this summer to look around. Anyway, I had to get up at 4:30 this morning to make the trip to Topeka, so I'm going to bed now.

       Today is my sister's 21st birthday, so if you happen to see a drunk girl wandering around Manhattan, KS, then that's probably her... or your mom.  Anyway, happy birthday Lindsey. Since I don't have any money I'll have to try to make something for you with whatever is sitting around the house, like Nate's wallet. If that doesn't work out, then I can just try to mail Crackers to you in a box.

       Only a couple of weeks after my brother made the switch to MovableType, Blogger has finally delivered an upgrade with lots of new goodies. I haven't really had much of a chance to mess with the new features since I am at school right now, but from what I have read, they sound promising. I can now remove my "About" and "Colophon" posts and replace them with separate pages, and perhaps even change to Blogger commenting rather than HaloScan. (I wonder how many people HaloScan will lose now.) So, everyone can expect many changes in the following week or so, which is nothing out of the ordinary for my blog.

       Everyone might think that I simply forgot all about Mother's Day, but that is truly not the case. First, I woke up late yesterday for some inexplicable reason, and I wasn't showered and dressed until after noon. Once I was dressed, I really didn't have much of a chance to make a post because Blogger was upgrading for a few hours. In the evening, I was actually over at my mom's house giving her presents and lots of love.   So, please don't be like my brother and say "if you really love mom then you would find a way to wish her a happy Mother's Day on your blog," because I did.  Just to clear things up: HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY. I love you mom.

       I am dead tired. For the second year in a row, I volunteered for the Bank of America River Run with my family. I had to wake up at around 6:00 AM to be out to the race course by 7:00, so it was a mistake to go to bed late last night. While last year we were assigned to water duty, this year we registered late, so we were stuck with course direction. Although the job title makes it sound like we just point runners in the right direction, our job was actually to barricade roads and divert traffic away from the course area. The problem was, we weren't provided with a map of the course, or even a list of the nearest open roads.   After about ten minutes on the job, I knew that I would be virtually worthless in directing people the right way, so I decided to go with my sister to aid the nearest water station. The runners thought that they had it hard running 10K, but they didn't have to stand for over an hour handing out water to 6,000 people. Pfff... Once the race was over, I went back to help take the barricades down and my brother had some pretty funny stories. It seems that many people became extremely angry when they couldn't drive on the blocked roads. In one case, a women on her way to church (on Saturday?), stopped right in the middle of the intersection and started screaming obsenities to herself. Right...  Anyway, in the big picture, the River Run is only a part of the annual  urlLink Wichita River Festival . It's our one claim to fame in Wichita. Basically, for a little over a week, Wichita hosts various events such as concerts, contests, art exhibits, craft sales, novelty shows, and fireworks. Although it was one of my favorite events when I was younger, I have increasingly lost interest in the festival. I don't exactly know why. Despite my disinterest, I went ahead and spent about two hours downtown with my sister this afternoon. I took some photos, got an airbrush tattoo, posed for a milk mustache photo, and wandered aimlessly. It was pretty cool.

       As I have made my journey into the world of photoblogging, I have discovered a closely knit network of likeminded people who enjoy the hobby. More and more, I find photoblogs full of great work and, in doing so, I have realized that there are far too many photoblogs to keep track of. Therefore, I think that it's better to stick with some of the photoblogs that meet your tastes, or perhaps ones have something in common with your own photographic interests.   For example, my brother likes  urlLink apparently nothing  because the photographer uses a Canon Powershot S30, the same camera that he owns. Many such photoblogs can be found through  urlLink photoblogs.org . Anyway, I just thought that I would recognize some of the photoblogs that I have been keeping track of lately, and try to pick out a few outstanding photos from this week.    These are a few of my favorite photoblogs:    urlLink [daily dose of imagery]     urlLink apparently nothing at all     urlLink c h r o m a s i a     urlLink emptyPictures     urlLink Jinky Art     urlLink pixpopuli     urlLink quarlo    Outstanding photos this week:    urlLink "Taking It Easy"  by Mark Wickens of selective memory    urlLink "spiral"  by Damon Brinson of damonbrinson.com    urlLink lake ontario from toronto, august 2003  by Joseph O.

       If you haven't been watching the NHL playoffs lately, then you are missing out. Last night's game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Toronto Maple Leafs concluded in some of the most amazing overtime play that I have ever seen. Although it was only a little over seven minutes long, it was so fast-paced that it didn't matter.  Only seconds before the winning goal was scored, Sami Kapenen of the Flyers was slammed into the boards so hard that it made me forget my own name. The replay of the hit showed just how much he had to struggle to get onto his feet and make it into his team's box. Forty seconds later, the game was over when Jeremy Roenick drove a wicked slapshot straight into the net.   The Flyers' win over the Maple Leafs, and the Sharks' win over the Avalanche last night conclude this round. The next round is the Eastern Conference final between the Flyers and Lightning, and the Western Conference final between the Sharks and Flames. You are guaranteed some good hockey if you just watch.  Check  urlLink ESPN.com  for more information on the playoffs. As my brother says though, you'll never find hockey on the front page.

       It just occurred to me that maybe people don't know who the heck I'm talking about when I refer to my brothers Nate and Zach, or my sister Lindsey.

       Alright. I slapped some new colors on this bad boy. I couldn't resist. It's the same layout and all, but I just switched up the color scheme. Don't fret. It's not like you would though.   Nate tossed out the idea of hosting my blog for me, and thus rescueing me from my little land of blog*spot. If so, it may mean that I can switch to Movable Type, maybe. Nate hasn't promised anything yet, and I don't want to give Lindsey any ideas, but he WILL host my blog one way or another, or else.  Stay tuned for my new URL if Nate does decide to be so kind. It should be something like natedillon.com backslash something or other.

       After this post, I will be taking a long break from my blog. I've recently realized that I haven't had the motivation required to keep a blog going, and that my posts have never been very personal, thoughtful, or interesting in any way. I have been trying to run a blog for the wrong reasons, none of which were actually for my personal reflection and growth. I have recently been spending far too much time on the computer, getting absolutely nowhere with the development of a new blog, when it was actually my current blog that needed help. I guess that I just need some time to do other things, and maybe along the way I will develop some great ideas and find some motivation. Anyway, thanks to my family and those few other people for reading. I'll be back in due time.

       As of today, my grandpa is a remarkable 90 years old. In celebration of his birthday, my family will be meeting at our grandparents' home in Columbus, Kansas for lunch tomorrow. I'm really excited to see my grandparents and cousins again, for what will be the first time in about eight months. We normally only see each other during Thanksgiving, and occasionally we visit our cousins in Tulsa, Oklahoma, so this should be nice. The only downside to this visit is that we will only be staying for a matter of hours. Everyone seems to have obligations the next day, so it has been hard enough just to set aside a few hours. Anyway, we will be leaving for Columbus around 8:30 tomorrow morning and returning sometime in the early evening.  So, for what's left of today, I wish a happy birthday to my grandpa, and I look forward to seeing him and the rest of my family tomorrow.

       A police officer came to my government class today to talk about search and seizure rights and to answer questions. As he was talking about pull-over procedures, I was reminded of something that happened about a year ago while my family and I were visiting our cousins in Oklahoma.  It was May and the weather was nice, so my brothers, sister, cousin, and my cousin's girlfriend decided to go to a park and play some croquet. We all piled into my cousin's car, with the croquet equipment and my sister in the back hatch, and drove off to the park. For some reason, my cousin decided to drive without his shoes, but we didn't have any trouble getting to the park. It was a rousing game of croquet that we all played, and I came from behind in the end to win the game.   After having so much fun, we all piled back into the car and started for my cousin's house. About a block from his house, a black & white pulled out from behind some trees along the road, turning its sirens on and pulling us to the side. Everyone in the car fell silent, as we began to think of all the marks against us. Not only was my cousin speeding, but he was without shoes, had expired tags, and my sister was in the back of the car without a seatbelt, cuddled up with a bunch of croquet equipment. It must have been a hilarious scene for the two officers, as they walked up alongside the car.   One of the officers walked to the back of the car and tapped on the window, as my sister stared back at him, surrounded by mallets and balls, while the other officer approached my cousin and asked for his license. As the officers continued to examine the car, noting the expired tags, the girl in the back without a seatbelt, and the absence of my cousin's shoes, they seemed to be rather amused. To the surprise of everyone in the car, however, the officers simply gave my cousin a warning and had him put on his new tags (which were in the glovebox the entire time).   As we drove off, we couldn't help but laugh at the whole ordeal. And let's just say that my great croquet win was brushed aside by the experience.

       Starring Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, Diego Luna, Barry Shabaka Henley, Zoe Saldana, and Eddie Jones. Directed by Steven Spielberg.   The Terminal  tells the story of Viktor Navorski (Hanks), a visitor to New York City from Eastern Europe, whose homeland erupts in a fiery coup while he is in the air en route to America. Stranded at JFK International Airport with a passport from nowhere, he is unauthorized to actually enter the United States and must improvise his days and nights in the terminal's international transit lounge until the war at home is over. As the weeks and months stretch on, Viktor finds the compressed universe of the terminal to be a richly complex world of absurdity, generosity, ambition, amusement, status, serendipity and even romance with a beautiful flight attendant (Zeta-Jones).  When I first heard about  The Terminal  back in April, my first thought was "Tom Hanks is playing a foreign guy?" I guess that I didn't give too much thought to the story behind the movie. Just recently, however, I discovered that the movie was actually inspired by a real man who has been living in an airport terminal in France for the past 16 years. Although it sounds like a fabricated story, it's actually true. You would think that there would be some kind of law that would prohibit someone from living in an airport, but I guess that it is allowed under the circumstances.  Beside this point, I ended up seeing  The Terminal  tonight. I went in to the theater expecting another "romantic comedy" because that's what I had heard it described as, and what I got was another level of the genre. It was a romantic comedy that wasn't overly predictable, and one that allowed time for character development, unlike most of its kind. In fact, I probably wouldn't even call it a romantic comedy because it wasn't very romantic per say.   Anyway, I thought that Tom Hanks did a great job as the main character Victor Navorski. Although I have heard his accent described as "laughable," I thought that he implemented it very well into the character and didn't try to force it too much. The humor from his character comes more from the situation than from gimmicks.  (I also got some laughs out of the character Gupta, played by Kumar Pallanatucci, who is in many of the Wes Anderson / Owen Wilson movies.)   Even though this is a different kind of movie for Steven Spielberg, he retained his chemistry with Tom Hanks, and he does a great job with the environment of the terminal. And last, but definitely not least, I have to mention the great work of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who really makes the terminal authentic, despite the fact that the movie was mostly shot on a set.

       For the past week or so, my brothers and I have been trying to come up with something (anything!) to do for our dad on his birthday and Father's Day. But, as always, we were short on ideas and short on money. When his birthday came around and we were without a gift, we were forced to settle for making him dinner and dessert. Now that Father's Day is here, we are yet again unprepared. So, I gave him the next best thing to a gift. I made him some more food. Pancakes and eggs to be exact. I also made an extra effort to go to church with him this morning for the first time in over a month. It was the least that I could do...   Anyway, here is another free gesture. Happy Father's Day dad!

       It's been over a week since my last post, so I'm trying to get back into the swing of things with this one. I don't have a very good reason for being gone for so long, except that I have been going to school during the day and spending all of my free time trying to make a website.   Anyway, my class has been going smoothly, and I only have a little over a week left. So far, the work load has been light and simple, so the remaining time should go by fast. Today we watched "The Day Reagan Was Shot," an example of the kind of work we have been doing. The teacher of the class seems to be another anti-Bush advocate, but luckily she hasn't forced much of her opinion on the class.  As for my attempts to make a website, I have made progress in the past few days, but I still need my brother to help me with parts of the style sheet. The only problem is that he works at night, sleeps most of the day, and he is leaving for school next month. It would be a miracle if he had time to help me.  I guess after I am finished with my class I should probably get a job and complete some community service work for National Honor Society. As I have previously mentioned, I also want to make a visit to the University of Missouri-Columbia this summer. I don't know about taking a vacation. I heard a commercial on the radio this morning for Kansas tourism in which Bob Dole appointed himself Secretary of Fun and advocated taking a road trip across Kansas. Anyway...  I'm hungry. Let's get a taco.

         Although I was only born when Ronald Reagan was leaving office, I have always seen him as a very lovable figure and a great man. I have yet to mention anything of his passing because, up until now, I knew very little of him. For this reason, I thought that I would remember Ronald Reagan with bits of his humor that I have picked up over the past few days. The following quotes are from  urlLink Ronald Reagan's page on IMDB . Most of them made me laugh out loud.   The best view of government is seen on a rear view mirror as one is driving away from it."  "Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours. Recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his." - in the 1980 campaign  "I love three things in life: drama, politics and sports and I'm not sure they always come in that order." - in 1964  "I remember some of my own views when I was quite young. For heaven's sake, I was even a Democrat!" - 1980  "Honey, I forgot to duck." - to his wife after the assassination attempt  "I hope all of you are Republicans." - to his doctors prior to going in the surgery room after being shot  "Does Nancy know about us?" - semi-consciously, to the nurse who hauled him on the gurney  "I know what it's like to pull the Republican lever for the first time, because I used to be a Democrat myself, and I can tell you it only hurts for a minute and then it feels just great." - 1980  "I've been criticized for going over the heads of the Congress. So, what's the fuss? A lot of things go over their heads." - 1985  "Politics is not a bad profession. If you succeed there are many rewards; if you disgrace yourself you can always write a book."  "You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans."  "Government is not the solution to our problems. Government IS the problem!"  "Now, I understand my opponent has been using age as an issue. However, I'll refrain from using his youth and inexperience against him." - said in a debate in 1984 in reference to Walter Mondale  "I have left orders to be awakened at any time in case of national emergency - even if I'm in a Cabinet meeting."  "My fellow Americans. I'm pleased to announce that I've signed legislation outlawing the Soviet Union. We begin bombing in five minutes." - opening an April Fool's Day press conference at the White House  "They say hard work never hurt anybody, but I figure why take the chance."  "Well, I learned a lot....I went down to Latin America to find out from them and (learn) their views. You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries."  "When I go in for a physical, they no longer ask how old I am. They just carbon-date me."  "Abortion is advocated only by persons who have themselves been born."

       Today was my dad's birthday, and he seems completely unphased by it. My brothers and I made him some hamburgers, hot links, and cake, but by the time we had finished cooking, I wasn't even hungry. Anyway, we have yet to eat the cake, so I am waiting to free up some room for that. My brother got some kind of weird Sponge Bob Square Pants ice cream to go with it.   I guess we still have to get my dad a present of some sort, but we were a little short on ideas when we were shopping for him. What do dads like for presents? My dad doesn't seem to sit down and watch movies too often, so DVD's are out. That's about all I can think of. I'll be in trouble when Father's Day pops up in a couple weeks.  By the way, today is also  urlLink Natalie Portman 's birthday. Not so long ago, I was somewhat smitten with her. I still want to see her in her upcoming movie  Garden State  this summer, but Nate seems to think that it will suck.

        It just doesn't get any better than Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. The series between the Flames and the Lightning has been great so far, and there is no telling what will happen in this game. I expect at least an overtime or two. You never know who will be a hero in a game like this one, but you can be sure that guys like Jarome Iginla, Martin Gelinas, Brad Richards, Martin St. Louis, and Vincent Lecavalier will be great. And of course, Miikka Kiprusoff and Nikolai Khabibulin will be tough to score on, as they have been for the entire series.  Althought I have been pulling for the Flames to win a cup for Canada (although I'm from the US), a win for the Lightning would be just as good. Anyway, the puck drops in about fifteen minutes, so be sure to watch. I'll be back for an update after the game.   UPDATE:   urlLink Fedotenko scores both Tampa goals   Alright, that game sucked. Until the third period, that is. I was all geared up for a great game, win or lose for the Flames, and I got crap. I wasn't upset because the Lightning were winning, but simply because the Flames didn't seem to be playing. Finally, when the third period rolled around the Flames got with it and scored one from the blueline! But it didn't matter I guess, as the Lightning went on to win it. Anyway, I'm happy for guys like Andreychuk who are winning their first Cup after such a long career, and for the young guys like Richards, Lecavalier, St. Louis, and Fedotenko. Also, I guess I should be happy that a team in the US won. Hopefully everyone watched the game, even though it sucked most of the time.

       The teaser trailer for  urlLink  Garden State   was released last week I guess, but I just watched it a minute ago. This teaser actually gives a little more information about the story than the first teaser. The movie will be released this summer, and I am really interested in seeing it. It was an official selection at Cannes, so it's supposed to be pretty good. Not to mention, Natalie Portman is in it.

       What? Oh, sorry, I fell asleep for a while.   It's already beginning to shape up as one of those summers when I do absolutely nothing. All the signs are there: I'm going to bed at a fairly decent time, yet waking up in the middle of the afternoon, there have been a few days when I successfully stay inside all day, and my daily activities include being on the computer and watching TV or movies. Luckily, I am determined to break out of this soon, and I guess I will have to by next week because I will be taking a class for three weeks. Still, even the class won't get me out of bed because it doesn't start until 11:30. So it looks like I will have to rely on my own ambition to get out of bed each day and do something productive, like getting a job.  While I have been inside these past few days, I have been working a bit on a website layout, and just yesterday I started on the style sheet (or I should say, my brother started it). I really don't know what will go on the site beside my blog, but I have been meaning to make a site for a while just to learn the process. Once the site is ready to upload, my brother will still be hosting it for the time being. I will hopefully be able to get my own domain sometime in the near future.  By the way, I have been looking into making a visit to the University of Missouri-Columbia, and I was wondering if anyone had an opinion on the school. The school is supposed to have a great journalism department, and that is one of the areas I am considering.
