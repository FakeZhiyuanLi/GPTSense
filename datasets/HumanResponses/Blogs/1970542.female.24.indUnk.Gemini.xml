       The race against time  i have a bodyfit (don't laugh) class to go to at 6.15, but I'm still eluting my protein, I can't leave it now Ive started and I feel very panicked, though theres nothing I can do. If I'd used enough matrix to start with it'd have been done just after lunchtime, but because I was watching my expenditure, I had to add more and wait a couple of hours for it to bind.  I should be pleased really, well I am, because theres loads of protein there. Oh well I have to go and collect fractions now,fingers crossed that I get it done in time...

       One rule for them...  I've just had one of those conversations which has really angered me. Somebody struck up a conversation with me about the   urlLink 17 year old who has alleged she was raped by a group of professional football players.  He (who shall obviously remain nameless) said that since the girl had consented to sex with one of the men (apparently this is reported in the sun) then the courts would automatically not believe her since she was promiscuous. Of course none of us know what has really happened but I am appauled that people actually think like this. I doubt you'd ever hear somebody saying the same about men, haven't we got a right to decide what we do and who we do it with? I just can't explain how angry and upset this has made me feel.

       The bugs are taking over   urlLink This  sort of thing really scares me. It's not so much that it's likely to happen but the fact that we are so unprepared and have continued to worsen the situation for years.  I'm going to have a look for more info on phage treatment. I can't believe it's not mentioned more, unless it's far less effective than I think.

       The road to Borth/Death?  I've just had a late breakfast. It was then, with the prospect of yet another weekend with virtually no human contact and the thought of all the work I've got to get through, gnawing at me, that i decided I'd go for a drive before I came back into work. I'm saying this much, driving on coastal roads around west Wales is not a good form of stress relief, unless you really want to relieve your stress in the ultimate way.

       Ooh it's autumn  It feels really cold this morning, no need for the air con in the lab, think I'll put the bunsens on instead!  It's really scared me, because it feels like it's almost Christmas, which means I really have started my final year of prac work. AAAGGGHHH! got to get on with it!

       Passport photo hell!  Yes I know everyone moans about this, but I'm still going to have a rant anyway! It's that time of year again, when new membership cards etc. need to be issued. I have a photo that I can  bear  to look at and that is going on my NUS (again), however theres only so many times you can reuse these damn things before they get torn and so I've just been to get some new ones for my gym card. No matter how hard I try to get a reasonable photo these bloody machines never fail to reduce me to a blubbering wreck. My latest effort makes me look like I have a skin tone something like David Dickinson's. Needless to say I have not! Unfortunately I am far too tight to even consider having them retaken and so I'll have to be reminded how dreadful I look every time I go to the gym (but at least thats not very often)

       Happy motoring  Just a quick one before I pack up and go home to say my car passed MOT without any problems, YIPEE. I could get to work without it, but I love driving, so I'd hate to be without it.

       You're doing a PhD and you're lonely?.....and?  I've just been speaking to the new PhD student in our lab, for the first time. She has left her family miles away on another continent to come to Aberystwyth. Not suprisingly she feels very lonely and unsettled at the moment.  It has taken me 2 years to realise that doing a PhD is often as emotionally draining as it is mentally. I love my work but I feel I miss out on quite a lot because of it. I'm 23 now and I actually feel my life is going backwards, the only thing that's progressing, albeit very slowly, is my work. My personal life seems to be getting worse, I never meet new people and I feel the relationships I have with my few good friends are beginning to break down. I think this is all due to the inevitable stress which is increased by the thought of the final year of work looming ahead. Unfortunately it's a vicious circle I'm stressed so I take it out on my friends, which pisses them off so I think they don't like me so i think about work more and get more stressed..... All this aside it saddens me to see people unhappy, and I really hope that the whole experience is more enjoyable for her than it is for me most of the time. However it seems to be normal to feel lonely and isolated when doing a PhD, perhaps it's the individual nature of the work and/or, as a friend of mine says, that we are inclined to over analyse ourselves, as we do with our work.

       Strange lab happenings  The phantom "shaker turner-offer" seems to have returned and has managed to delay my experiment by a few hours, which I could really do without. Also I suceeded in not squirting coomassie (bright blue) stain all over my lab coat and face, much to the disappointment of my colleagues. This last thing is amazing considering that I usuallly end up with it at least all over the sink.

       I can't afford a copy, and the National library is too cold   One of my colleagues has just lent me a book that will be really useful for my thesis, it's so good I thought I might try and get a copy myself. I just had a quick look on amazon and found that it costs Â£75! This isn't a huge text book or anything, it's about A5 size at a guess with about 300 pages! It's a lot of money for a book that size but I'm not surprised, specialised books are usually very expensive. I am a bit disappointed though. As an undergrad I used to love being able to buy all the relevant books for my course, and they're still useful now. It's just not reasonable to buy books at this price, especially when they go out of date so quickly.  I'm just grateful that I'm lucky enough to have access to a copy that dosen't have to be read in the library.

       Do you remember..?  Is mischief night just a Northern thing? or do other people know about this? I've just been talking to a friend at work (well it is Friday afternoon) about this and she knew nothing about it. I know that it's fallen by the wayside a bit these days but that's no excuse, she's a fair bit older than I am, so perhaps it's because she lived down South most of her life.  I know that devils night is a big thing in America still but I can't understand why people don't remember it happening in Britain too. When I was a kid my parents used to be scared to go out of the house on the morning of halloween to see what had happened overnight, egged cars, tyres let down were all usual, and once (before i was born) lard was smeared on the side of all the houses in the street. Not that I'm being sentimental about it, (I mean it is just an excuse for vandalism (god I sound like my mum now)and once it moved on to lifting up manhole covers in the middle of very busy roads it became really serious) but it's strange how these things seem to die out and never even seemed to exist in some areas.   (btw mischief night is the night before hallowe'en when kids used to go throwing toilet paper, eggs and flour around and generally being mischievous. It became a big problem in the late 80's (I think), with arson and more serious vandalism (other than eggs I mean, not arson) started to become more frequent.)

       Hallowe'en  I'm supposed to be going out "gothed-up" tonight. I used to like this when I was younger, but now I find it quite a daunting prospect. I don't know what it is really. Maybe it's because it's such a small town and I don't want to stand out too much, or maybe it's because I don't want to look like something I'm not. (But of course both these reasons contradict each other a bit, "I don't want to be noticed/ I don't want to hide behind a mask") In reality I just don't feel that comfortable with the people I'll be going out with and I think I'd at least like to feel comfortable in my clothes. Well at long as it's not a repeat of last Friday, I'm sure it wont be too bad.

      Well I just made the biggest purchase of my life yesterday (No not a house, and besides you need a partner to make the biggest mistake of your life) I bought a new(ish) car. Since I'm a girl I ought to go on about the fact that it's lovely and shiny and black and that it's got a CD player (what will I do with all my tapes?).  Actually though, although I love the colour and the CD player is an added bonus I'm a bit more practical really. It's the right size and it goes pretty quick ;-). It's safer and if it does break down I have a warranty for 2 years.  But I'm still very excited about it (I hardly slept all night) I just need to keep my car in one piece for a week or so untill I trade it in. OK think I've showed off enough now, sorry.

       Classy  The dancefloor of the bay hotel on a Friday night is a bit of meat market at the best of times. Particularly after 1am, when theres less than an hour to go till closing. I'm used to watching drunk blokes, who have by this time generally lost the power of coherent speech try and pull girls by feeling them up. Well it happens everywhere really dosen't it? and I thought I'd seen and heard the lot but last night I was shocked when a bloke pushed me up against the wall and tried to grope me.  I wasn't best pleased. I pushed him off and told him in no uncertain terms (and not in so many words ;-) ) that he should go home and relieve himself (well he wasn't going to get anywhere with me and I doubt he'd have any luck with anybody else). To which he replied, "but I want to  do  you, I want to do you really hard, up the arse!"  Nice.  I decided not to take him up on his kind offer and told him to leave me alone, which he only did when I threatened to punch him.  It makes me wonder whether he was so drunk he didn't know what he was saying, or whether he thought it might actually work. If so, what kind of girl did he think I was? and what kind of signals am I giving out that makes people think that I'd really like to have anal sex with a drunken stranger?

       Carpe Diem  I'm feeling ridiculously optimistic today, and I'll probably not feel this way for very long (but I hope I do) I'm determined to try and have fun (and work hard). I've had people telling me that it's in my own hands, and now I see they're right.  I have lots of things to do at the weekend, including a lot of reading for my work, (then I'm off to Llandudno for a desperately needed break) but I feel quite excited about getting back on track with everything.   Just hope I can keep the positive attitude.

       Speed Dating  Well I've never been out on my own before (you know, to a pub etc) but last night I went to the union to go speed dating. I decided (with some persuasion) that I might die and never have done anything like this, and besides the worst that could happen is that I pay my Â£3 and I leave after 10 mins cos I feel too awkward. Well it was OK (apart from pretending my friends had left so that people didnt think I was a real sad act). It wasn't well organised, not proper speed dating and really it was just the usual disco. Still i managed to talk to quite a few nice people (and the obligatory weirdos). I didn't know I had it in me, now I just want to do it properly (humiliating scorecards an' all)

       Indian nightmare  I started watching  urlLink The Lakes  last night. It's great and it reminds me of being 17 when I was doing my A levels (a very happy, carefree time). I had forgotten just how rude it was though, especially the first episode with Jill Halfpenny (Phil Mitchell's wife in Eastender's) and her friends. Thing is though, it really made me realise that we're missing good series like this at the moment. I've always enjoyed these sort of programmes. i have the whole of  urlLink this life  on video and love watching it. Like the lakes, it's well written, well acted and above all interesting. My disappointment with some of the programmes at the moment was just increased when we turned the lakes off at 9 to watch  urlLink Indian Dream  this was truly abysmal. Don't beleive the hype (and ignore the fact it won an award) it was just terrible. The story was condesending to all parties portrayed and the very motivation behind a programme like this makes me sick. We are a multicultural society (not without it's problems, obviously) and I don't like the way people feel that some "amazing" overlap must be found. Surely we are beyond thinking that other cultures are only acceptable if people can show they appreciate Shakespeare or English villages. I know I haven't expressed what I mean very well, apparently the word I should use is "fetishising" (thanks S). I think this was what I felt the programme did of Asian's and Asian culture (both British and immigrants).  Hmm hope that makes sense.

      Got up feeling bad this morning. I really didn't want to come to work (in fact I still wish I was at home with my pile of as yet unwatched DVDs) but I had to come in for a meeting and I don't take days off just because I feel like it. Anyway, my flatmate had a few things to do in town so I settled for going in to work a bit late, hoping that I would feel less despondent after a wander round. Amazingly it worked, I feel loads better. I don't want to make you feel sick but it's all because people in shops (and even the PO!!!!) were helpful, and my flatmate is so patient and understanding with me even when I'm irrational, and difficult. Sometimes people are wonderful.

      So it was a  urlLink Student protest on Welsh lectures  that stopped me being able to get on campus this morning. I think it's a waste of time and for the record, there was no direction to alternative entrances, because there aren't really any.

       Petrol  I filled up my car in Huddersfield before coming back, and it only cost me 72.9 ppl. Here in Aberystwyth it costs 79.9. Now I'm not saying that petrol should be really cheap, and I think it's high time that some real money (and expertise) was thrown at alternative forms of fuel / electric powered cars etc. But I do not understand why rural areas (or at least areas with fairly infrequent and expensive public transport) should pay more for petrol. Surely places with better public transport should pay at least the same.

       Hair straightners   The only thing that makes me feel uncomfortable in Leeds is the trendiness (yes i know it's not London but still). Too long in Aberystwyth makes you forget how the rest of Britain is. I love Aber. It's small, and you can wear what you want. in fact you're more likely to get stared at if you dress up too much.  Trouble is that when I was out on Friday night (really dressed up for me), I found myself feeling really releived when I saw a lass with wavy hair (like me) that hadn't been straightened and I felt a bit scruffy all night. I hate feeling that self conscious, I'm not a girly girl but it pisses me off when I feel unfeminine (is that a word?) as I did on Friday. Still I'll never bother straightening my hair, I just can't be arsed.

       Ooh interesting..   It was great to talk to people who were easy to talk to, I know all my sister's friends are almost qualified teachers and therefore bound to be good at communicating but I had no idea that such intelligent people could be such fun to talk to.  Is it that I'm sick of hearing people who have their heads up their own arses? Probably. I think it's a symptom of doing a PhD, you spend so long trying to justify your work you never stop.  Oh well it made a nice change

       Mind games  Just had one of those days yesterday where I feel people are trying to emotionally blackmail me. There was a time (probably about 3 years ago at most) when I would still have fallen for this crap. Now it just makes me angry. I have spoken to other people about this and they agree that we have done nothing wrong, but somebody is trying to make us feel bad. Or just trying to get us to do something we don't want to by making us feel sorry for them. I wont stand for this shit anymore. I think everybody reaches a point when they decide not to get walked over and manipulated by so-called friends (if they can help it). The stupid thing is that this particular, on-going, incident is about something so trivial that I wouldn't normally give it a second thought. But as I said, I hate it when people try to guilt trip me and so it's really winding me up.

       On a brighter note...  Well had a bit of a think and decided that I should try and stay positive,  One good thing that happened to me this weekend was a good friend of mine ringing me out of the blue. We don't often see each other and usually just text now and again (though when we do meet up we can just pick up where we left off)  Unfortunately he got dumped this weekend and is quite cut up about it. Although it's a sad time for him I am happy that he rang me a couple of times to talk about it. It's always good to talk to him even when things aren't going that well for him, and it made me realise how lucky I am to still be in contact with him.

       What have I done?  Just feeling like I've given up/lost too much for what I'm doing right now. I'm not that happy at the moment and I'm not even sure if it'll make me happy when I finally finish this PhD. Other people seem to enjoy it more, I can't help feeling I must be missing something.

       Shutup! ....please  Once again theres a reversing alarm for a lorry ringing outside, and it's really getting on my nerves. Along with the ridiculously loud fan on the knackered computer in the office, people talking to themselves, the lift opening and closing and the freezer switching on and off I think I'm losing it. I was trying to work but all I can concentrate on is that bloody noise.  I just can't help it. I've been known to leave the office in search of peace and quiet simply if a lorry is outside, because the low vibrations drive me mad. They just seem to reverberate round my head and eventually I can't stand it anymore. I've always been like this. I hate the sound of lawnmowers (particularly on otherwise perfect summer mornings), washing machines and hoovers (unless I'm the one using it). I may be intolerant, and it may just be stress and perhaps I should wear earplugs, but sometimes I just want the noise to stop.

       More food  I know i've blogged about food once already today but I'm off out to have tapas tonight for my mate's birthday. Thing is, as a northerner I think I'm suspected by some of only eating faggots (not true, infact I've never tried them. though I do have a thing for baked bean pie - dont ask). I'm really excited about trying something new, I just hope I like it, the only thing worse than a load of beer on an empty stomach, is a load of beer after eating something that made you feel sick.

      I just can't beleive that somebody has been funded to find  urlLink the 'perfect' cheese sandwich  and he calls himself a scientist. I love cheese but I think that this study (apart from making a mockery of people trying to get funded for research in more important areas) could ruin my love of cheese, in the same way that dissecting shakespear's plays in GCSE English can stop you from appreciating the whole play. Shame on you Dr. Fisher. (and yes I know it's only cheese, but it's a subject very close to my heart)

       What would Kylie be without her arse?  A very good point I think. I was moaning about how I found Alex annoying and a friend pointed out that at least she dosen't use sex to get on.  So, I still maintain that I don't really appreciate her style of singing etc. but I suppose there is a lot to be said for her making it on merit alone.  I'm all for a bit of integrity.

       The land of nod  Set up o/n cultures, so off home now to my flat which has become a bit of a sleepy place today. flatmates are yawning and finding it difficult to stay awake (and some are failing miserably)    It's great,  because it makes me feel as though I have been uber efficient ;-) all day.

       Oh no not Alex  I don't really watch fame academy (no honestly I don't) but I saw it a few weeks ago and had the misfortune of having to sit through most of the final last night. I can't belive Alex won, I don't think she can sing well at all (obviously she's loads better than me but that dosen't take much). All the songs sound the same and although I'm partial to a bit of radiohead and coldplay myself, it'd be nice if she could sing happy songs without the whine and the Avril Lavigne "I'm so helpless and lost" expression. She just annoys me. No doubt blokes will think that I'm envyous of her. NO. I just think she's shit!

How do I feel? relieved to know it's not just me, sad now I've realised it's true.

       The weekend at last  It's been a very rushed day, had a new protocol (q long) to do before lab meeting at 2. just got it done and had time to get half a sandwich eaten before going in there and telling them all the things that are wrong at the moment in the lab. (well somebody's got to say it) Glad it's friday, looking forwards to a beer and a little less stress for a couple of days.

       yipee  Heard some news yesterday that has really cheered me up. I'm so happy for the person it concerns, She's done so well. But also it has restored my faith in..... well everything, the chance of a career, equality, the importance of doing a good job.... just everything.

        Well have you done.......yet?  Well i made that class last night, though I had to sacrifice some protein. Then I went to see Shed 7, who were great, despite the piss poor turn out.  The week has been hectic with work stuff so far, it dosen't seem to matter how well things are going e.g. this protein expressing so well (even though it's luck), I still feel that it's not good enough. Can't say too much about this but I'd like to make it clear that I am happy with the way this bit of work is going, but I feel that some people never are.

       More self indulgent crap (sorry, but it's best to get it out)  I spent some time wandering around Aber yesterday afternoon, doing a bit of shopping. It was grey and damp, but I was trying to think positively (yes it's mainly about that bloke, but also because so many people are going to leave soon. The few people I do know wont be here, and I'll miss them). It worked well for a time, but then as always it descended back into negative thoughts. The whole thing goes full circle, like this;  "I can be fun to be with, I'm intelligent and I'm not that bad looking, not stunning, but not repulsive either, so It's his loss, and it's people's loss, if they don't want to spend time with me" hmm, Josie is smiley and happy, "fuck you you C***".......  "but then if that really is the case there's still no hope, if there's nothing wrong with me then it's just that people are only interested in themselves and their own gratification" smile has faded, feeling confused and a bit depressed, "what happened to enjoying other peoples company?"  "Well that just can't be the case, look how many couples and groups of friends you see around. It must be me" Fuck it! I'll go home and sulk in the flat, at least it's warm and dry there.   I never have got the hang of this positivity thing. It's like writing my CV, it's one of the hardest things I have to do. Unfortunately I can't help but try to balance the argument.  I know how absurd this sounds. I can see that I don't really think rationally, I know it's just emotion, and basically I'm disappointed, but my way of dealing with that is to take it out on myself. As soon as I come into work and start thinking about other things I can see that, and I can distance myself from that part of me.

       World AIDS day (Decemcer 1st)  Call me a cynic or whatever, but I don't think this suggestion in an email I received will help much;  "If you can't get or afford a ribbon don't worry, you can help just by spending a minute thinking about those with HIV/AIDS"

       Christmas dinner outfit  I haven't only got work to think about over the weekend, I'm not quite that sad. I have to find something to wear for the xmas dinner in 2 and a half weeks time. I made a big mistake last year, and since then I made a mental note to myself NEVER to go to work dos with my tits hanging out again. So this year I want a respectable but not frumpy outfit, but one that still feels like me. I'm stuck, I don't even have half an idea of what I'm looking for, but my mate assures me I'll find something. How do you get something that looks nice and feels comfortable, isn't too revealing/figure hugging, but you still have half a chance of pulling in, if the opportunity arises?  (any suggestions for outfits will be greatly appreciated)

       Calm before the storm?  I've spent most of the day shitting myself (Not literally, obviously, I am 23 and have full bowel control and haven't eaten anything dodgy) i've been scared about my presentation, my accomodation, getting a job, but mainly about my finishing my PhD. Now though I feel quite calm. I think I have a bit of a plan forming in my head, and this weekend I'll work on it more. I hope I can keep feeling like this, I don't need to freeze from the fear again.

       Ignorance isn't bliss, it's just fucking rude  I have a presentation of a paper to give tomorrow for "journal club" (the name is the brainchild of a woman who is very religious and doesn't seem to appreciate us shortening it to JC, I wonder why?) but although I've only just got a copy of my chosen paper (ie. I have yet to read it in full, make notes, and make a presentation) I am still thinking about something else (as per bloody usual) I don't want to sound like a Luddite or anything, but I only discovered the wonders of email when I came to university in 1998, and of course text messaging only started around then too. The thing is I use them all the time, and both are incredibly useful, but I don't like it very much at times. I still struggle with the etiquette of emails, how to address people (I tend to be quite formal but if I met them in the dept. I'd call them by their first names) whether to bother replying (I usually do, even though it fills people's inboxes with messages like "thats fine, I'll see you then" when it's totally unnecessary) etc. Then there's text messaging, I hate it when people text when I'm talking to them. All too often I'll be sitting eating with somebody and out comes the phone, and they spend the next 10 mins trying to get hold of somebody else, I'd rather they just went and had lunch with them. Then there's all those times I see a couple of people sitting together, but both texting other people, why didn't they just stay at home, they might as well be alone because they're not talking to each other. But worse, far worse than this is when I text somebody and they decide that they will wait ages til they reply (obviously you can't always reply very quickly but there are certain people who seem to have a set length of time which must elapse before they allow themselves to reply, so as not to seem too eager, or to look like they have something better to do.) or they don't reply at all. My real gripe with both emails and texts is that I never know whether the other person is just being rude, or whether they haven't received the message. There is actually a reason for this rant. I sent a text the other day (to the aforementioned bloke - see a few posts back) and have never received a reply. Whilst I am certain that he hasn't replied because he's not interested, there is still a small hope that he never received it in the first place. If I  knew  that he'd got it, I'd know for sure. It pisses me off though, because I'm sure he's just decided to ignore it, and that's just rude, (especially since it took a lot of courage to send it) he could just have said he was busy or something, I'd have understood. I always reply, however difficult it is thinking of what to say, I just wish other people did the same.

       Love Actually  Against my better judgment (especially after the vodka induced vomiting the trailer alone drove me to) I went to see 'love actually', last night. (Being the miserable bitch I am at the moment, I had vowed never to watch it but there you go, It's a woman's prerogative to change her mind) I really liked it. It was cheesy and predictable, but it wasn't half as bad as I'd expected (although it made me cry, but then I cry easily at films) Yes it's sickly but I'd recommend it if you want a soppy feelgood film, and as one of the lads said that we went with "If you take a  lass to this film, you're bound to pull!" fair enough I suppose (though I'm not altogether pleased by this comment )

       Smoking ban  So urlLink  doctors  want a public smoking ban .  It's a difficult issue because the people who are going to be most annoyed about a ban, ie. the public/customers (not the workers) are not forced to go and sit in pubs and restaurants breathing in other people's smoke, but since passive smoking has been proven to kill, surely employers shouldn't be allowed to force their employees to work in an environment which is hazrdous to their health.  I personally would rather not have to breathe in other peoples smoke when I'm having a meal (just because I like to taste my food without the taste of smoke) and I would hope that such a ban in pubs (though I'm not bothered about people smoking in pubs, like I said it's my choice) would help to cut down the amount people smoke (though I know this wont happen) But I cannot get away from the fact that passive smoke is harmful. I have to fill in COSHH forms for almost everything I use in the lab, anything with even the slightest toxicity etc. has to be used very carefully. As in all lines of work there are strict health and safety guidelines which have to be adhered to, but passive smoking is one which seems to have slipped through the net. So I suppose I have mixed views. I don't want to live in a country that tells people what to do all the time (we don't have government officials telling us not to eat burnt toast because it'll give us cancer), and when you consider the other pollutants that we are all exposed to (from cars etc) it seems almost petty. But it does kill, and you shouldn't have to put your life at risk for your work. I think the bottom line is that people should be able to work (and go out) without having to put up with a smokey or smoke-free environment (since smoking is legal perhaps it is fair to say it is an infringement on smokers' liberty if they are not allowed to smoke in a public place), but since passive smoking affects other peoples' health and smoke-free environments do not, I have to say that I'm for the ban.   (I should point out that I used to smoke quite a bit, on and off (It's something that i did usually when I had exams, but had started to become a regular thing, so I decided rather than become "a smoker" I should stop before it got too bad. I last had a fag 2 months ago). I think I would have found a ban in pubs useful because that was when I was at my weakest (and where I did it most), I found it difficult to refuse when everybody around me was smoking. If I couldn't have smoked in pubs, I would have given up sooner, and probably wouldn't have started smoking so often in the first place. However, I know that this is probably not the case for most smokers, many of them enjoy and want to continue smoking and so this just isn't a valid argument for them)

       Feeling Better  I got stuck in to some reading for work last night, nothing complicated, just some background biology on the organisms I'm working with. It's made me more enthusiastic and now that I've started reading in the evenings again, I'm going to try and keep it up. Then when my mate got in I had a talk to her about everything (including the huge changes that are going to happen in the lab) and she made me feel so much happier. It's good to know I can talk to her, and I'm lucky to have somebody who'll listen. Anyway I'm going to try to keep thinking rationally, for my sake and everybody else's. I'm ashamed of how weird I've been recently I'm just glad I'm feeling calmer now.

       Bare Minimum  I've just come back from a great weekend in Newcastle (upon Tyne) where I was visiting my mate Eddie. Even the trains ran according to plan, and I had a good time with him and his flatmates (thank God England won the rugby, or I'd have been surrounded by sulking men all weekend) Anyway the thing about traveling on your own is it leaves you a long time to think. I left Aber on Friday afternoon with my head in the clouds, optimistic and really excited about seeing Eddie again. I was thinking how great it is that you can get on a train and meet nice people. People who want to talk just for the sake of it. I even enjoyed (Alan Bennett stylee) listening to 2 lads who were in the TA talking (very seriously) about night ops, and how you should never say over and out, or you sound like a yank (apparently over means "I'm waiting for a reply", and out means "conversation end", but I don't know if that's true) On the way back however, I felt less happy. I've known Eddie for 10 years now, he is my oldest friend,and we can talk about anything. Subsequently we talked a bit about our love lives (or lack of them) I explained to him how I feel that given the chance this bloke I like at the moment would put in no effort at all ( I asked him for his phone no. The other day, and whilst he didn't mind at all, I think he would have been quite happy to just bump into me occasionally, and if the mood took him....) Eddie can always be relied upon to tell me the truth (or at least the way he sees things). He told me that he hasn't met a bloke yet who would put in absolutely no effort in a 'relationship' if he could get away with it ( I know this doesn't mean that all men are like this, but he's one of the nicest people I know, and he admits that he's treated women this way). We then started saying how you just have to make sure that you don't let them get away with it. So I feel a bit fed up about the whole situation. I hate playing games. I try to make it clear what I think and I expect the same from my friends. Why would you want to be with somebody if the only reason they want to spend time with you is because you make them? It's no way to live. Surely people either want to spend time with you or not. I'm not looking for Mr. Right at the moment, but the last thing I need is to waste more of my life on somebody who doesn't really like me. All I really want is somebody who quite enjoys spending a bit of time with me, nothing more, nothing serious I just don't want to be taken for a fool again, but it seems hopeless.

       Out of the Blue  I had a text and then phone conversation out of the blue last night, with my ex. Apparently he's got a 19yr old pregnant, but she's dumped him (the reason he called I think). He was very drunk and kept going on about how we should meet up for a drink, how he could even come and visit me here in Aber (no fucking chance, there's reason I haven't seen him since I dumped him almost a year ago). I just can't believe how much of my life I wasted on him. I spent most of the conversation sobbing, he seems completely oblivious to how much he hurt me. It made me sad, but I'm tired of trying to deal with it. I'm just going to write it here, then I'll put it to the back of my mind.

      Wow, this sounds like an amazing piece of work. This isn't just proteomics, this is a  urlLink protein map  of  Drosophila  protein interactions. I hope it's as good as it sounds when I get the real paper. Also, it's nice to read about functions rather than 'possible functions' 'sequence homology to' and 'may be related to' for a change, not that I'm bitter or anything.

       Back to normality  I said earlier that I felt other people were rubbing my nose in it, but I know that it's me that's got the problem. My life is a big mess at the moment, and my response to it at times is envy, even jealousy, and anger directed at other people. Other times, it's anger towards myself, because I know it's all up to me, I have to sort my work out, and it's my fault I feel lonely. Then sometimes, like now, I feel sad, and I just want to cry. I've tried blaming the stress from my work, but tbh I'm just a great big, emotional, irrational, thick, idle fuck up. But I'm working on it.  I have a meeting tomorrow with my supervisor and I'm hoping that I'll feel a bit better (about work at least) then. As for the rest of my life [ sic ] I don't know. Maybe it's just that I'm meant to be a bit of a loner. Anyway I'll call my sister tonight, because I haven't spoken to her for a while, and I'll get my work in order for tomorrow, and then I'll probably eat some cheese and chocolate ice cream (not together) and hopefully I'll start to feel a bit more normal again.

      I know I'm being oversensitive, and I want to make it clear that I don't blame these people, but I feel like people are trying to rub my nose in things at the moment. I heard the other day that a lecturer in another dept. had asked if me and my female friend were 'together'. I don't even know this bloke, and I'm pissed off that it should even matter to him whether people are gay or not. The thing that really hit me about this though, was that if I had a boyfriend (or looked like I might ever have one) it would never have been said. Then this morning my mate was saying how she was going to go to the football match with people from work (something she's been wanting to do for ages). I said "well you could have gone on your own" and she said, "yes but it's nicer to have people to go with". I barked a reply, along the lines of "well we don't all have that luxury do we" and went back to my room (well it was morning, and I hadn't eaten). The thing is though I felt like shit. I have to go places on my own quite a lot. I like time on my own, but it'd be nice to have the option more often.  I know it's just my own neuroses but I don't need reminding what a loser I am. Now I've got that out of my system I'll go and do some weird science stuff, that makes me look like even more of a freak.

       No, honestly, I'm fine  There's nothing guaranteed to piss me off more than people asking me if I'm OK, when there's nothing wrong. All day people have been saying "are you OK, you seem stressed?" "You seem stressed, didn't you sleep very well" etc. etc.  Of course I'm fucking stressed! I have a maximum of 10 months left to complete my unknown quantity of experiments, and yes it's on my mind all the time and if I let myself, I panic. But I'm OK (today at least). I haven't been shouting at people, I've just been getting on with my work, so I don't understand why everyone keeps pestering me. Sure it's nice that people seem to be concerned for me, but I wish they'd stop asking how I am.

       Playing the fiddle  I went to a concert last night, It's been about a year since I last went, and I really enjoyed it. Trouble is whenever I go I want to start playing my violin in an orchestra again, and I feel a bit sad that I can't do it here.  You see Wales has a great reputation for music (as does Yorkshire actually) but they take it very seriously. That's fine but it does mean that there are no orchestras you can just attend, and play for the enjoyment. They all seem to require auditions, and I'm not that good, and I don't agree with it. When I used to play in Huddersfield (3 a week at one point) it was fun, and although you had to be pretty good for one of them (not too much of a problem as a violinist because you can hide a bit) the others were very easy going and they just wanted to you to show up and give it your best shot. Nevermind, perhaps I'll be able to start up again when I get a job somewhere, till then at least we're lucky enough to have access to decent (and cheap) concerts..

       It smells like something's died in here  Whilst procrastinating (I mean looking for a chemical she required) my friend stumbled across an amazing product available from Sigma chemicals.  Stink bombs can be a thing of the past with your very own pseudo corpse scent kit, including scents for "early detection/below 0 degrees C" and "post putrification". Imagine the scientists who have to work on these things, do they have to compare the smells with the real thing? what a job! I pity the poor bugger who has to check the trauma and fear scent formulation. What on earth can that smell of? would he have to compare it to the smell of someone who's shat themselves? oh well, we're thinking of getting some corpse scent, not for dog training of course, but for the profs office, that should keep him out of the way for a bit.

       If Smirnoff made recombinant proteins  My ambition outweighed my capability last night (not for the first time in my life) when I decided (after seeing a trailer for 'love actually') to drink half a bottle of vodka in about an hour.  I felt a bit numb when I woke up this morning and I have a vague recollection of making myself sick before going to sleep/passing out. Itâs good though really, I feel a bit like the woman at the end of 'the piano' when she jumps off the boat and then decides she wants to live after all, because had I not been sick, Iâm sure I would have died. I wasnât suicidal or anything, but my outlook is a lot more positive today, and Iâm putting it down to the Smirnoff experience. If only it could have the same effect on my work.

       you do it to yourself  You'd think at 23 I'd be past leaving work in the afternoon to have a cry, wouldn't you. Well I didn't quite do that but I did leave for half an hour to get my head together. I feel like a complete failure I can't help my work being a mess but I know better than to go making life more difficult for myself. I don't want to revert to my teenage "if you hope you'll only be disappointed" but I think I'm in danger of it. I have a lot to be thankful for, I just wish I didn't feel like I had to make such a huge effort to be happy.

      I remember once hearing a story about someone I knew from school who went to Oxford, or Cambridge (can't remember which) Anyway, apparently they have a system there with a card which you have to use to get into and borrow form the library and use other university facilities, but it was also used in pubs and kebab shops etc. round town.  When this lad failed some exams in his first year he was called to the dean's office and asked why he did so badly. When he tried to blag his way out of it a long list of where his card had been used was produced, and he was asked why he had only been to the library a few times and what he was doing out on the piss the night before an exam and when he should have been in lectures and so on.  Now I know that this story must be exaggerated at the very least, but I have reason to believe there is some truth in it and my point is that I don't like the idea of my every move being watched (It's a bit like a paranoia of mine, that all your dead relatives can see what you're upto, not a nice thought, and one I have to convince myself isn't possible) I also understand the university's concern at a bright student failing exams but surely how he managed to fuck up is his business? and if he chooses not to tell them that he prefers drinking and eating kebabs to studying that's his prerogative. They can throw him out, we can all agree it's a waste of lea funding etc. but it's his business.  I was thinking about this because of the  urlLink plans to introduce identity cards  in the UK in the next 10 years. Firstly I don't understand what good they will do, how will they help in the fight against terrorism? surely it will be possible to forge them, what is the point in such a costly scheme? And also it bothers me that they may be used to store other information about people and I like my privacy and think we should have a right to it. The usual argument is "if you've nothing to hide..." well I haven't, but surely that entitles me to go about my business without being watched. What worries me is the sort of information that may be held on these cards/databases, for instance the type of work I do could look suspicious, if you're looking for someone possibly connected with germ warfare (OK I'll make this clear, I'm no rocket scientist but you only need a little knowledge with some organisms and some basic molecular biology techniques to appear to be capable of such things) and as far as I can see, if the card is to be used to claim NHS tretment etc. it will be easy to link with every aspect of your life, job, marital status, health, everything. Basically I just don't trust the government and the way they use information about people. It's not so much that people have things to hide, more that I think a lot of mistakes are made, and conclusions jumped to when information is stored like this. It'll be a sad day for me when I'm forced to carry an ID card.

       Overthinking  I'm in a bad mood today (quite obvious from the last post I'm sure.) Not about everything, I'm just easily wound up today. Thing is my head is all over the place, I'm distracted and it's so silly. You see theres somebody I like, and have liked for a while. I had a dalliance (I love that word, my mate John uses it and it makes it sound so sweet and innocent) with him the other night, which was/is great, but I wonder if it could happen again, I'd like it to.  I don't really see him anywhere except where he works, and although I've seen him since, I really don't know what is happening/could happen.  Apparently I'm overthinking it (this is true, I'm sure), but I couldn't believe my luck, and still can't so of course I'm going to think about it.  I know I've got to try and forget, but I just wish I could see in to the future a bit and then I could relax.

       I'm not boring, they are  A friend has been really concerned that he's "out of the loop" with his work mates recently because he chooses not to "play the game". Fortunately my work isn't that bad from this point of view, but after this weekend I do feel a bit left out myself because the friend I went to visit has a much more mature lifestyle than me (or at least thats how she made me feel by not asking a single question about me). A lot has happened in my private life this year, splitting up with my long term bloke cos he was shagging around and getting involved with someone who was no good for me etc etc., it's only now, in novemeber that I feel that I have a good idea what I want. My priorities at the moment (missing quite a few) are;  WORK-THESIS-PHD-JOB Friends Having some fun (hopefully) with bloke(s)  you will notice that getting in relationship with somebody I want to spend the rest of my life with is absent, as is buying a house, and becoming a suburban housewife/career woman. It's not that I don't appreciate that people actually want to do these things, it's great to see people happy, but it is NOT the be all and end all and just because I don't have the same aspirations at the moment dosen't mean that I have a boring life that's not worth hearing about. Sure, I'm wandering around thinking about boys and silly things, but thats the way my life is at the moment, I can't help it. I didn't ask to be landed in this huge pile of shit last xmas, I'm just trying to enjoy myself now that I've got over it.

      god help me. I've got myself in a bit of a mess with my work so far this week, ie. I haven't really done much. Partly this is because I'm still distracted by this weekends goings-on ;-). This is not good. I really need to grow up and stop day dreaming about pulling boys.  Also though, it's because I'm getting really panicked about my work. I really need to get a lot done before xmas, but instead of getting on with it I seem to be almost paralysed with fear.  I only have myself to blame, I have been idle ever since I went to Llandudno, and this has made me scared to start again. Oh well, no matter. I have to go to my supervisers house for a fireworks party so I suppose tonight is out, but I have made a decision to get up to date with my lab book and make plans for my prac work tomorrow. I'll let you know how it goes.

      Just spent a bit of time mucking about with my blog, including adding it to the list at bloghop. I was quite happy till I saw that somebody said they hated it. Fair enough, after all I write this blog for me, but I think hate is quite a strong word. I wish I could say that future posts will be of the highest calibre, but it wont happen. Lets face it, the point of blogs is to talk about everyday life, and unfortunately that (or at least the edited highlights you can blog about) is often a little mundane.

       Flipping beermats  Oh no, I can't believe that somebody has spent so much time and effort developing  urlLink a beer mat that's better for flipping . Am I missing the point? I thought they were meant to soak up condensation and dribbles from your pint glass (not that many establishments in Aber use them, they'd rather your pint stick to the table, and woe betide anyone who actually  leans  on the table, you soon find that your clothes have become stuck to it) Personally I'd be happy if some of the offending pubs here actually started to use  normal  beer mats. I hope these "aeromats" don't catch on, blokes are inclined to sit in the same place, in the same pub, for long enough without this sort of distraction, and what is the point in making a beermat partly out of foam? It wont be very good at the job it's intended for, not to mention the environmental implications of producing yet more foam waste.

      Just had the obligatory "what I did this weekend" chat with my Norwegian friend and colleague. She and her Northern Irish fiance took a trip to Scotland with his boss/ friend and some other Welsh people that they didn't know, for a sheep sale.  They had a good weekend (they were very excited about getting some more sheep (it's a hobby, he's a vet really) and they both love Scotland. However they all went out for a meal together, in the car on the way there My friend was talking to one of the Welsh women who was asking where they were from adn if they understood Welsh. Despite telling her that they didn't understand, they proceeded to speak Welsh in the car and for the majority of the meal, leaving my friend and her bloke to talk to each other.  How bloody rude! my mate is fantastic at English (hell she even understands my northern accent and can immitate me really well) she is almost fluant in French and knows a fair bit of Italian and a few words of Welsh, not to mention her first languge Norwegian, and the second Norwegian language that she knows. It pisses me off enough when people try to make a point by speaking Welsh round me. I know I ought to know some since I've lived here over 5 yrs, but I don't and the reason for that is that I don't need to, everybody speaks English. My mate spends her whole life here speaking English, a second language, and when she does meet Norwegian friends she is careful that she dosen't exclude people. If she's telling a story, and somebody comes in the room, she immediately swaps to English so that they understand too.   But it's worse than this isn't it? they were having a meal, with people she didn't really know, and they chose to exclude them form the conversation. She said she was tempted to answer in Norwegian, but wouldn't do it because of her fiances boss (pity really). My point is, I think that the Welsh language should be preserved, but I hate the way some people feel that it's necessary to only speak Welsh, to make some kind of point, it's not as though they don't understand English and whether they like it or not, Wales is part of Britain. They should just get over it and stop being so xenophobic, they might actually earn a bit more respect that way, as it is, it's hard to be sympathetic when people are so rude.

       Preying on people's emotions  A colleague got an email today warning her about a new drug progesterex, it was very similar to this;  "There is a new drug that has been out for less than a year, Progesterex, that is a essentially a small sterilization pill. The drug is now being used by rapists at parties to rape AND sterilize their victims. My best friend's mom works at a pharmacy and she said the drug is available exclusively to veterinarians to sterilize large animals. But I have heard from several of my friends that are still in grad school up north that at frat parties at their schools (Columbia and Penn State) the drug is being used with Rohypnol (roofies), the date rape drug. With Rohypnol, all they have to do is drop it into their drink. The girl can't remember a thing the next morning of what happened the night before. Well now Rohypnol is not being used alone. Progesterex, which dissolves in drinks (alcohol or soda) just as easily, is being used with it so that the woman doesn't conceive from the rape and the rapist doesn't have to worry about having a paternity test identifying him months later. But the drug's affects AREN'T TEMPORARY. Progesterex was designed to sterilize horses. Any woman that takes it WILL NOT HAVE CHILDREN EVER IN HER LIFE. All guys have to do to get this drug is just know someone, like a friend, who is in the Vet school of any university." urlLink  urban legend reference page     I was suspicious (I mean, I just couldn't imagine how a pill could render you infertile), but she was very worried, saying how glad she was that she didn't have to grow up worrying about these things. So naturally I looked it up.  Now OK a  urlLink Google Search  quickly reveals this to be a complete hoax, but I'm amazed at how sick people are. I just don't find this kind of thing funny. I'm not paranoid about things like date rape (hell I live in Aberystwyth) I do watch my drink, but mainly to check that nobody is nicking it ;) But other women shit themselves about this sort of thing, it's so unkind to scaremonger.

       Lyrics  Well I've always been bad at lyrics, never mind eh. At least I'm not as bad as my mate who though "pappa don't preach" was "poppadom beach", and "big girl" (in that Kevin and Perry song) was "bingo". I also had a mate at school, years ago, who thought (despite having the inlay-dumb twat) that the therapy? song "trigger inside" said "not a nigger in sight". (my score was 30.5 btw, and 5 of that was for telling them that I found the link at B3TA. I really am shit)     urlLink

       Sorry, I meant homeopathy  My mate read my blog yesterday and was laughing at me calling nux vomica hippy shite. Actually she's right, it's not fair. I don't know how this stuff works, but I have used homeopathy before, and all I can say is that it does. I had a wart on my knee when I was about 13, and I was going to the doctors to have it frozen off, every 2 weeks. This didn't work. It was sore and was scarring. Then I tried  urlLink Thuja , and in 6 weeks it had completely disappeared. I also used it for veruccas, and it got rid of them quickly too. (and without that painful burning stuff you can use) I haven't used it for years, since I haven't had either since my early teens, but it did work then, and I've advised pople to use it since. I don't actually want to believe it works, because it makes no sense at all, and I've been ridiculed for suggesting it to a colleague before now. But there you go, thuja at least works for me. Amazing.

       I feel dirty, but not in a good way  Having listened to jibes about last night all day, I feel a bit crappy. The blokes think it's funny, they know what the bloke's like, and are just teasing me repeating what they heard him say to me. The women though, make me feel awful, as if it was my fault. It's nothing specific, but it's the way women are with each other sometimes. It's shit though, as my mate said, when I complained that I couldn't lamp him one because he's my boss, It was him that was behaving inappropriately. So why do I feel so dirty?

       No hangover  Despite drinking an ocean of g and t, a pint of cider, red and white wine and a brandy I am not hungover (just tired) There are two possible reasons for this; 1. My over indulgent weekend has raised my alcohol tolerance to fantastic new heights 2. That  urlLink Nux Vomica  that my friend suggested taking as a hangover cure/prevention actually works  Unfortunately there is no way of telling which as the exerimental design is flawed, and there's no way I'm planning on not taking the hippy shite just in case it works, I'm not risking a hangover, not even for a brilliant piece of science like this.

       Party 2 - Arrggh  No that's not what was supposed to happen.  I made a lot of effort to look good last night, but I didn't want the amorous attention of one of my bosses. That was bad enough, I was pissed off (he is married etc. and I wouldn't go there if he was the last man on earth) but worse is that moment when you turn up at work to find that everyone had noticed and has been talking about it. Great.

       One down, one to go  I had a nice time last night but it was very quiet. a reflection of the department at the moment I guess. I had to have a few drinks to help the time pass, and to take the edge off my self conciousness when dancing to the shittist disco in the world, but am not hungover. I'm just trying to get the enthusiasm together for tonight. The skirt is ironed, (thankyou S) and all I have to do is wash my hair and stuff, then I'll be ready for another party, just the small matter of what to do with the rest of the day first.

       Party 1  Well I'm not sure what to wear yet (though I'm sorted for tomorrow) and I'm worried about not overdoing the drinking (so I'll be in a fit state for tomorrow). Should be OK though, I just hope plenty of people turn up.  (btw, the chances of pulling are slim to none-all the decent ones are attached, so at least there's less chance of an embarrassing day at work tomorrow)

       Newsletters in Christmas cards  I don't know when this started, there used to be some cards with hand written notes which were special, but a letter that's sent to everybody, isn't that a bit impersonal? They're not a bad idea I suppose, my Mum gets some from people she only bumps in to a few times a year, and a short note about how the family's getting on is sometimes nice.  Whatever I think about them, one thing is certain, I associate these letters with proud parents and grandparents, not with someone my own age. I like to think that whilst people still have a reasonable amount of time to themselves they manage to keep up with their friends and any important developments in their lives.  However, this weekend I got a Christmas card from a lass I haven't seen for years. Fair enough, it's the season of good will and all that, so it's nice to have a blast from the past, but I'm hardly friendly with the girl.  Last year's was bad enough, with a bit of a brag about her fabulous new job and how she was earning a fortune (which I replied to with something along the lines of, "I don't get paid much, and never will, but I really enjoy my work, which is the most important thing to me etc." ) but this year there was 2 A4 sheets, with 5 colour photos. It includes such gems as, "we only had a couple of holidays this year" and "Unfortunately, our beloved hamster Mr Wozz died earlier this year, still a great pain to us both" and a list of their pets, including a guinea pig called fadge! I don't think I'm going to reply, unless I ask her if she's taking the piss (especially with regards to her pets' names), but actually I'm sure she's not.  I can cope with letters from my mum's friends about their daughter's third class degree in some mickey mouse subject and her marriage to an ex-con. This kind of showing off is understandable at least, but to hear similar swanking from this girl is just a bit sad.

       Far too much alcohol, and far too little sleep  What a great weekend. Although I feel a bit drained, I think it did me good. Amazingly I was forgiven by all concerned for my terrible outburst on Friday, and after talking to them about it, went on to have a really good night out. I slept really late on both Saturday and Sunday (a real rarity for me, I usually wake at 7 no matter what) I went for a really late lunch with friends on Saturday and basically just bummed around for 2 days. OK the flat looks like a bomb's hit it, I did make a bit of tit of myself by saying something stupid to the bloke who never replied to my text, and I'm worried that I'm really old now, because a lad who was chatting me up walked away without saying a word when he found out I was 23 not 22! (how weird) But it was great, I just hope I can get my energy back ready for my consecutive xmas parties starting tomorrow!

       Need caffeine  I'm desperately trying to organise all my stuff at work, I have found loads of papers and things I haven't read, and need to read, and bloody soon, they are now in 3 big piles on the table by my desk. I don't know what to do, I need to put them in some kind of order, or I'll never know where to start. I need to get all my notes up to-date and the thought that this is the beginning of the long haul is hanging over me like a huge black cloud. I'm absolutely fucking knackered (thanks to our house guests) and pissed off that I had to leave 4 people sleeping this morning because I had to get in to clear the cold room in time for an electrical inspection. I must get on, but my head hurts, and I can't seem to get warm, and now I'm blogging for Christ's sake, like that's going to help. Right, I have some proplus somewhere, I'll have some of those (I don't like coffee) and I'll try to pull it all together.

       Teal is a horrible colour  well first time ive ever bothered to post anything like this, I was bored. It's kinda close (but then these things always are, you can always make bits apply to you) except working too hard, I don't work hard enough at the moment, but I do hold hard workers in high regard so i suppose it could mean that...;-)         you are teal  #008080         Your dominant hues are green and blue. You're smart and you know it, and want to use your power to help people and relate to others. Even though you tend to battle with yourself, you solve other people's conflicts well.  Your saturation level is very high - you are all about getting things done. The world may think you work too hard but you have a lot to show for it, and it keeps you going. You shouldn't be afraid to lead people, because if you're doing it, it'll be done right.  Your outlook on life can be bright or dark, depending on the situation. You are flexible and see things objectively.         urlLink the spacefem.com html color quiz

       Growing up?  I was reading a bit on  urlLink wizzlopia  about trendies, and laughing at  urlLink the anatomy of a trendy , when my colleague asked me if I was trying to emulate trendies, by the way I dress. WHAT! NO! NEVER! The thought of it! I was 15 all over again, the very word making me feel sick. Me, a trendy, how dare you!  But hang on a minute, though the thought of being a trendy still repulses me, I'm hardly the lass I used to be, I have Bench, Hooch and Miss sixty clothes and spend far more on clothes than I ever would have dreamed of a few years ago. Sure I'm not a trendy really, I'm still too grungy, but I suddenly realised how much I've changed.

       Negative or just a bit more realistic?  So apparently, according to my friend, I should think more positively about people, give them the benefit of the doubt etc. It's funny really because I think that I am just starting to be more realistic and I think it's her deluding herself that's the problem.

       Am I finally learning to shut the fuck up?   preamble ; Although I like arguments (see last post), I often end up in arguments I hate, simply because I can't sit there and let someone go on, when I feel strongly that what they are saying is complete shit. Like the one I got into the other week with somebody I had met for the first time (It was about windmills, but it's best not to get into it here). It became very heated, I completely disagree with her, and it made me take an instant dislike to her. Not that it matters, I rarely see her, and I didn't say anything I regret, I really believe in what I was saying. But, I still feel a bit bad about it. I think I come across as a very aggressive and uncompromising person at times, which is not entirely how I see myself. I think that some of the way I react is my trying to assert myself, and show that I do have some opinions. I often spend time with social scientists and other arts students and I feel completely lost when they talk about their work, I don't understand at all (just as they wouldn't understand if I started talking about the technical details of my work- but hey, I can manage to forget about it sometimes ;-) ) As soon as I hear somebody say something that I know a little bit about I jump in, with both feet. Sometimes I come unstuck (they use such big words (and they say scientists can't communicate with people)) and I end up taking my point to the extreme, annoyed by their sometimes ridiculously liberal and in my view, non-factual arguments.  What I'm leading up to; A Postgraduate student in another department here has done a photoshoot for loaded magazine. My mate  urlLink posted on his blog  about this last week and then yesterday, the woman in question asked him to post  urlLink a reply to his post . Anyway the thing is that although I'd like to comment on the post I have decided I'd be best not doing so, I don't want to fall out with someone I don't even know (not that that would necessarily happen, she might agree with what I think) this is mainly because of the way I feel about the previous arguments I've had recently, and also because I wouldn't be able to say what I want without sounding like a simpleton (at least to arts students).  I don't think this is a bad thing though. Perhaps I'm finally learning that I can keep my opinions to myself, and hang the lot of 'em if they think I'm thick, it's still better than looking like an antagonistic bitch.

       Sigh  Unfortunately things haven't got any better for my friend that I'm worried about (the reason for yesterday's post) In fact it's fair to say things are looking pretty bad. Unfortunately my hands are tied.  I hate this. I'm used to saying what I think to people, I like arguing, (when it's something I'm passionate about) and would usually be making it pretty clear what I thought to the people involved. In this case though, I really can't say anything. I can't even let them see that I have an opinion. I hate being dependent on people, but I am dependent on these people, and so I must bite my tongue, and I will. I know what's good for me. I just wish I could do something.

       Do not trust to hope  I still can't get over how thoughtless and unkind some people are. This is a recurring problem for me.  It started on Dec 22nd last year. It's as though somebody dragged me from my little cocoon, kicking and screaming, them saying "you think that most people are kind and think of other people's feelings, you think that if people treat others well, be loyal and honest you will get the same in return don't you?-well you have a lot to learn, this is what people are really like..." I  can't go in to what has made me feel like this today, all I can say is that I'm sick of seeing people that I care about, kind people, get shit on.  I don't think I was naive before, I've always had a healthy amount of cynicism, but looking back on the year, there has been nothing but a long list of disappointments. It's resulted in me feeling that there are very few people I can trust. People who should be looking out for other people, are in fact forgetting about them and making their lives very difficult, without a second thought. I've learned not to expect anything from anybody, apparently it's normal to assume that people are only in it for themselves.  I'm not perfect, I have off days, and there are times when I shit on people, but I feel awful about these things, I do care and I try to make up for what I've done. I'm sick of people not caring at all.

      Things are going well today, things at work are, ...well, working (yipee) and I feel relaxed and happy because I had such a good weekend.  Tapas and dancing with work mates, a concert, a few pints with my mate and her bloke, Sunday driving on a beautiful day listening to jimmy eat world, ah the bliss. Even the obligatory shopping at Argos, which was crowded and full of scruffy children being shouted at, couldn't dampen my spirits.

       lol  I feel really rough today (hungover), so I'm feeling sorry for myself, but despite my self inflicted misery I've been laughing a lot, well I had to, if not I'd cry. My Norwegian friend, in her ever escalating excitement about Christmas, has been singing Norwegian Christmas songs, and whenever I say something she mimics my accent (by far the best imitation of a Yorkshire accent I've ever heard) Where does she get her energy and enthusiasm from? My guess is it's the thought of getting out of this hell hole for a couple of days.

       Diminished responsibility  After seeing something on TV this morning about  urlLink Oxytocin  I have decided that I may be producing too much of this hormone. It has many roles in reproduction, but as I heard this morning, when you have sex with someone, it is this hormone that causes you to become more attached to that person. (and the more often you do it, the bigger the effect, even if you didn't like the person that much at first) Not only does this give me an excuse as to why I feel so attached to someone I hardly know, but also why the 'fuck buddy' thing doesn't really work for me. However, my mate says I'm not producing too much, she says I feel like I do sometimes, because I'm a girl.  Oh well, it's still nice to think that there are things beyond my control, that cause me to feel the way I do.

       Good things  In an attempt to boost my flagging enthusiasm, and help me get my arse into gear with my work (now only 8 and a half months max of lab work!) I have decided to try and post something positive, or nice that has happened each day.  Today I had a very nice piece of pizza for lunch, read banal shite in heat and talked to my friends, whilst eating it!  there that wasn't so hard, was it?

       Oh no Bono again  I don't want to sound uncharitable, but when I saw clips from the urlLink 46664  concert for world AIDS day, I had to wonder what the point was. It may appeal to somebody, and if they raised some money, then it's all well and good, but personally I'd have paid money NOT to have seen Bono and Beyonce doing a duet. In fact I'd gladly have poured molten wax over my genitals rather than hear this shit. Who the fuck does Bono think he is? or more to the point what wankers actually buy his  urlLink artwork  and want to listen to his terrible attempt at singing? I know it's all for a good cause, and it's raising money blah blah blah. but it amazes me that so many people actually like him. It'd be a lot less painful for those of us who want him to shut up, and fuck off, if instead of painting some crappy pictures and raising thousands of dollars, he just gave some of his millions to charity.

       I know the meaning of life, the universe and everything, and it's not 42  Well according to the play I saw last night (apocalypse wow) the reason for existing is masturbation. I only went really because my mate's student was in it and she asked me if I'd go along too, it was actually really good, a bit like a school production in places, but it was entertaining and a great way to spend Sunday evening. Plus it's the best meaning of life I've ever heard.

       Pessimistic? Never!  Last night I was lying in my warm cosy bed, drifting off to sleep. I was knackered cos I'd been sanding and priming a new desk for my computer, and trying to get some work done that the prof really wanted for today. Anyway, I was feeling quite happy. I was tired but happy in the knowledge that I'd achieved something during the day, and  happy because I'd just received a good night text. You'd think that it would be the perfect way to get off to sleep wouldn't you? But no, my fucked up, tired little brain was still whirring, and what popped into my head? An image of Henry Rollin's video for  urlLink Liar . I wasn't even thinking about things, I was falling asleep. All day I've had a slightly uneasy and neurotic feeling that my subconscious is trying to tell me something. Let's hope not, after all, I've never been fond of castration.....

      Well I haven't blogged for ages because I've been busy with work and other stuff and I'm still getting used to having my computer at home. No real excuse actually is it? To be honest the things that have been going on are either mundane (ie. work-though it's progressing OK) or not things I've wanted to write about here.

       What's happened to me  I haven't anything to blog about really, so instead I'll tell you why. Apart from a very busy weekend in Oxford (which was great fun) I have done little other than work and text. Yes, that' right, text, and it gets worse; I have turned into someone who sends smileys in reply to texts. I have even sent kisses! I worry about thinking of a witty or suitable reply.  Help, how has this happened? I'm a text junkie. I used to hardly ever send any. Now I'm on at least 15 a day!and the addiction is growing. I actually expect to start my day with a text! get texts whilst I'm at work that I only get at lunchtime, and get several texts before I go to bed. i'm not looking forwards to the withdrawal.

       I love  urlLink Multimap.com   I'm going to Oxford tomorrow with my mate, for john's birthday. It's brought out the geeky me I'm afraid. I've printed off about 6 maps now, showing where the shops we want to find are, where the pub is that we're meeting at, where the travelinn is, and others just showing more details of the roads and stuff. If we get lost, it'll be my co-drivers map-reading skills that are to blame, and certainly not the lack of maps. However, if we get mugged because we look like tourists, it will be my fault for being so anally-retentive.

       A window on the world  I checked my stats today, and amongst the weird and wonderful searches that have led people (god help them) to this blog, was one google search for "fuck buddy aberystwyth". It's really got me thinking, who could be searching for that? I want to know more.  My mind runs away with me (a symptom of the boredom I'm experiencing doing this bit of work today, I suppose) I can't help imagining that it could be somebody I know, or that it could be someone who's just moved here who wants a 'friend'....  Just reading how people have got to your blog is fascinating, the problem is it leaves me wanting more information. I'll have to stop myself from looking at the stats too much.

       In addition...  Also something happened last week to make me have even more hope. It's helped me prove to myself that not all people are the same, and when someone doesn't like me, it doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong with me. I'm going out on a limb here, I hope it's not premature, I don't want to tempt fate, and I'm touching wood while I write it etc.etc., but despite what I've believed for the last year, I think perhaps not  all  men are cunts and liars.

       Josie's self-help  When I wrote that post yesterday, and read about straight edge lifestyles, it got me thinking. You see the thing that I came to realise more than anything over xmas was that I felt bad about myself, and some of it was completely avoidable. I don't mean drinking (though that does make me feel worse when I'm feeling miserable) I mean the way we live our lives in general. I used to think I was a decent person and treated people well, but there was in particular, one incident (or should I say a number of related incidents) last year, in which I caused someone a lot of unhappiness. I'm not proud of this, and I've had to come to terms with what I did, but I knew that I was hurting someone the whole time I was doing it. (yes, that makes me sound awful but sometimes people are selfish I'm afraid, I'm not looking to repeat it and I've definitely learned from it)  At the same time some of the things I did made me, directly, feel bad about myself. It was difficult to break the cycle, and actually I ended up repeating it at times. The difference being, that I couldn't tell at first that I was hurting myself. What I'm getting at is this, respecting other people, and treating them well is obviously important, but sometimes we forget to respect ourselves, and using the fact that other people don't respect us is no excuse. Iâm going to try from now on, to have a bit more respect for myself, and realise what when something is bad for me.

       Resolutions  I've never really made new years resolutions, they're too easily broken, and if you want to do something why wait till new year? So aside from the "starting as I mean to go on " with my work (hell it's essential if I'm gonna get it finished) I didn't think about changing anything. I stopped smoking last year,  and unlike  urlLink mrwizzle  going  urlLink  straight edge  just isn't an option for me, I like my beer too much I'm afraid. That said, I did want to feel happier this year, and something had to change to enable this.  So, firstly I bought  urlLink This diary will change your life  just before Christmas, in the vain hope that it would do just that. I have followed it, so far, except I didn't get round to sticking any 'out of order' signs on anything on Saturday and there are some things (like self- colonics (which is as bad as it sounds I'm afraid) 13th April) that I just wont even consider doing. However, I don't actually believe it's the diary that's made me feel so much happier (even though it is hilarious.)  Instead, I actually think that it was the uber-relaxing holiday with my family, which made me feel more like myself than I have done for months, that has brought about this huge change. I started looking forwards to coming back to work and finishing my thesis and basically just regained some self esteem. So even though I didn't really do anything to change myself, or my behaviour, I've found that I feel like a different person to the one writing this blog a couple of months ago.

       Back to work, with renewed enthusiasm  Amongst many other things (the usual xmas and new years stuff), I read a book this xmas by David Lodge, called 'thinks'. I loved it. I haven't enjoyed reading so much for ages. I loved the story and the insights into relationships and the arguments about consciousness (don't get me started) but the best thing is that it actually made me enthusiastic about work again. I realised (though this will sound a bit snobby I'm afraid) Just why I have put up with this PhD. I want to be part of academia, OK there are shit things about it, but I love it really. This is the life for me!

      wow what a fucking day! It's so strange to see so much snow here. It's a few inches deep now on campus. unfortunately it has frozen and it's like walking on..... well, ice.  I had a really successful day in the lab (not often I can say that) An experiment that I've been working on, on and off for a year, (solving one problem then hitting another) has worked!! I'm knackered now though. It took 12 hours in total, and then when I left at 7.30, (unable to move my car because of the lack of gritting or snow clearing on campus) I had to contend with the ice rink that is the majority of pavements in Aber tonight. I fell over once (after several near misses), or should I say I lowered myself down onto my arse in an attempt to not slide down penglais and straight into the sea. I can tell you this much, "graceful as a swan" is not a phrase that can be used to describe me. In the end I walked in the road, because that was clear and I decided I'd rather be knocked over than break my neck, or at best, be seen walking like a complete twat all the way home. Anyway enough of all that. For once everything I did worked today. I really feel like I've accomplished something, not just today but with my PhD as a whole. I'm off for a long hot bath, and then to bed. I will sleep well tonight.

       It's snowing!  There's only a very light covering down town and on campus, but it's very unusually to have any at all here. There was even some snow on the beach this morning! Of course in true Aber style they didn't seem to bother gritting last night (or at least not enough) and they didn't do it early enough this morning. So the schools are closed and loads of people who could otherwise got to work have had to take the day off to look after their kids. Being from Yorkshire it makes me piss myself. We're more used to bit of snow, and the gritters keep most of the roads clear, but then my Norwegian mate laughs at me when I tell her about when we had 6' drifts etc.  Anyway, it's really pretty, and so unusual. I'm glad I had to come in a bit early today because I got chance to take a couple of photos, and saw it untouched. Beautiful.

      I've been worrying (obvious I know) about what I'm going to do when the lab moves and I'm stuck here writing up. So I've started to make a few minor decisions. I've ordered a CD burner for home (since I wont have access to one here, and I need to back up some rather large files) and have decided that I'll just make do with paying 5p a sheet for printing (using the university's laser printers) when it comes to printing out the final draft. And I'm going to start looking for someone to move into the flat;   WANTED; 1 FLATMATE, TO SHARE FABULOUS 2 BEDROOM FLAT IN ABERYSTWYTH AVAILABLE JUNE 1ST - JANUARY 1ST GAS CENTRAL HEATING (COMBI BOILER), WASHER/DRYER, LARGE LIVING AREA, CAR PARKING, BROADBAND AND FANTASTIC VIEWS. Â£250PCM   IF YOU LIVE IN ABERYSTWYTH AND KNOW ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  AND IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN ABERYSTWYTH, PERHAPS YOU COULD CONSIDER MOVING HERE. IT'S QUITE NICE REALLY.  (All applicants will be subjected to a shallow grave style interview, (just for the fuck of it - I'm too desperate to be picky))

      G (the twat) once asked me if I had a 10 year plan. He was basically taking the piss and trying to make me feel like a fucking weirdo for wanting something more from a bloke than just a fuck. Anyway, obviously I don't have a 10 year plan. But inevitably my life up until now has been a series of shorter plans just because I have been in education since I was 4. When I started my PhD I knew it was going to take 4 years to completely finish it, but most importantly I knew that for the next 3 years I would be doing my lab work. Now I'm nearing the end of those 3 years and I'm staring into the abyss that is my future. I know what sort of job I'd like eventually, but I'm not sure how I'll get there. Some unexpected things have happened, my lab moving away in summer and leaving me less time to finish, my flatmate moving out before she has finished her 3 years leaving me with a lot of decisions to make about my accommodation and more importantly money. Then theres the other unknowns; Will I get so and so results?, will I manage to write up by Christmas?, Will I pass my viva?, will I manage to find and get a job I like? and the whole time I'm supposed to just concentrate on my work.  It's also making me doubt everything. I can't make proper plans (because I don't know how much money I'll have and if I end up borrowing I can't justify spending that money on  going out/on holiday/weekends with the bloke). I've even started to question some of the things the bloke says to me. It seems too good to be true, and i don't want to get my hopes up. I'm fed up of thinking things are Ok when they're not.  I imagined having my colleagues around whilst I was writing up, which would have been helpful had I had any problems, and I had imagined having enough money to live off when I was writing up. Of course things change, but I'm stressed and it's hard to deal with.  Anyway, If I get a job in science I will undoubtedly be working on 3 year contracts, so I'd best get used to change.

      I'm a fucking failure. I'm 23 and I have to ring my parents to ask them if they can lend me quite a considerable amount of money. I hate having to ask them. I hate being dependent on other people. I know that I'm still a student, and that the money I have is from them originally anyway, but I actually like being able to manage my own finances. Now I can't.

      I'm hoping/desperately praying that I will have submitted my thesis by Christmas. If so, then this time next year, I will either have had my viva, or be waiting for it. So, this time next year it should all be over. It is this thought alone, from a colleague, that has kept me going today. The thought of feeling this stressed for the next 12 months doesn't fill me with joy, but at least there's an end in sight.  It's just the uncertainty of it all. I know everybody doing a PhD (or at least a science PhD) feels the same. The fact that so much seems to be down to chance. Not knowing what results I'll end up with makes it quite difficult to write some parts of the thesis even at this late stage. Also I have the slightly added stress that the lab wont be here anymore after August, leaving me less time than originally expected and absolutely no chance to run over (which is a good thing really I suppose) then there's the problems everybody has when they're writing up; where am I going to get some money to live on? And where the fuck am I going to live? It will all sort its self out I'm sure, but sometimes it's hard to imagine how.

      Bad, bad day today. Lots of panicking at work, and for once, it wasn't me who started it. Me and T have only a few months left and we're getting scared. I had to thank her today though, because without her I'd be so much worse off. I feel very fortunate to have her to go through it with. I know it's not life and death, but it is 3 or 4 years of my life in total. The outcome could affect my employment prospects for the rest of my life. The content of my thesis will definitely affect my first job and I've been given an oppurtunity that many people never get, so with all that weighing on my mind, I do feel the pressure to perform. anyway, we talked, we planned, and i think that we both came away feeling better about it all. I just hope that we make it.

       Wales 1, West Yorkshire 0  Horrible weather today. It's a bit cold, which is OK, but it's damp and wet everywhere. The sky is low, and there's no real colour, it's not really cloudy, just overcast. it's just bloody miserable.  I noticed it when I went across to stores, in another building, to pick up some ethanol and stuff. As soon as I stepped outside I had loads of memories of journeys to and from school and college, and endless breaktimes spent in a miserable wet playground. There are a few downsides to living in Wales, the shit telly (S4C, no C5 reception and terrible BBC Wales programming takes us down to a very poor 3 channels) and the staunch Welsh nationalists (get over it - most parts of Britain have become accustomed to people from other places moving in) but the weather is not one. The reason I noticed what a horrible day it was today, and had all those flashbacks to school etc. is because we rarely get these kinds of days here. Yes it rains a lot, but when it does it pours. I can cope with that. Besides, there are enough gloriously sunny days (ah the joys of coastal weather) to more than make up for it. In Yorkshire however there are lots of grey days. It can be quite miserable, the sort of weather that makes you want to emigrate to a better climate. Today I realised how lucky I am to live here. At least the weather usually does something.

       Hippies take note: Just because I'm a geneticist, doesn't mean I work for monsanto  Iâm as opinionated as the next person, but I think thereâs a time and a place to express those opinions. When I had a meeting on Friday and found myself almost snapping at the boss, I stopped myself, and listened. Sure, I have different opinions to him on my work, but I have the sense at times to let him talk first, and watch how I say what I think on the matter. Anyway, In the same way that I show some restraint when talking to people I expect most people to do the same, and this is especially true when meeting someone for the first time. On Friday night I went to a party, mainly people Iâd never met before. Not a situation I like at the best of times, but since they were the blokeâs friends/acquaintances, I felt a real pressure to make a good impression. The first person I talked to took it upon herself to make me feel as awkward as possible. After the usual small talk, she told me exactly what she thought of the subject I study. Fair enough, but she couldnât even see a point in people trying to find cures for cancer or HIV (not what I do, but a related subject, and something I believe there is a lot of value in) Itâs not the fact that she had different ideas to me, If it had been someone Iâd known or someone I hadnât been at all bothered about Iâd have reeled off the usual arguments, and though I wouldnât have changed her opinion, I would at least have felt that I explained my own opinion. I didnât of course. No. Crippled by this ridiculously desperate feeling that I had to be liked I simply stood there and shrugged my shoulders. I looked fucking stupid. Now, Iâm not uber bright or anything, but Iâm not stupid. I know my subject, I love it, I believe in it, and I have principles. If only Iâd dared to express them. The upshot of all this is that I actually donât like her. Why the hell was I worried.

      I had my first ever clubbing experience at air (formerly code) in Birmingham on Fri night. It was fantastic and far from the weird crowd of drugged up hardened clubbers in strange clothing that I had imagined. Sasha was fantastic, the sound system was amazing-it was loud, but you could here each other speak!?! and the lights and lasers had me mesmerised, best of all though was the atmosphere and people's attitudes. Far removed from the slight edge of aggression I usually experience on a night out (in pubs) people seemed relaxed and all there for the same thing- a good time, and a dance. I'm going again, and soon.

       I'm no computer expert, but some people make me feel like a fucking genius  I'm panicking about talks. I have 2 to write at the moment. It's not really a problem, I need to panic so that I get them done, but I can do without computer illiterate fuckwits making life harder. I was given a CD the other day with some stuff on that I might be able to use in my talks. The idea being that it would save me some time and there's no point re-doing tables and figures etc. So far it has only wasted my time. The man didn't know how to burn the CD, then told me the CDR disc I'd given him wouldn't work, refused to use anything but CDRW and consequently I've had major problems opening the files (due to software differences). So I had to have a colleague get the files (no easy task) on his computer, and burn me a copy on CDR (at his expense)  so that I could actually have a look at the files I'd been given. And all this happened after he made me put them on  my filestore and caused me to go over my available space - thus prompting a string of nasty e-mails from information services. Finally it's sorted, but having looked at the files now I wish I'd just done it myself, it would have been quicker. There's so many changes that need to be made....

(and wish I didn't)  "Elvis has left the building" "we are leaderless" "crazy scene" "dooby dooby, dooby doo" "keep us in the dark and feed us shit" "A trained chimp could do molecular biology" "Oh, he's gone for a strategic planning meeting..... in the outside office"  "%!$#* (the thing most people work on in the lab) is sex" The banging of the autoclaves as they fill with water The postman stomping up and down the stairs early in the morning The lift as it goes up and down and the doors open and close The noise of the decrepit -80 freezer switching on outside the office The noise of high heels on the corridor   Don't ask, just bored of hearing the same phrases all the time (and this really is just the tip of the ice berg) and it got me started....

      A friend told me the other week that his sister keeps a diary of all her dreams. I thought it was quite an interesting idea, but not something I could do. Apart from never being bothered to write every day (I remember loads of my dreams) I don't think I should write most of my dreams down. over the years I've had loads of odd ones, and some were just down right disturbing. This weekend for instance I dreamt I was working for Jamie Oliver, and he was shouting at me about my cooking, I was then searching for bananas and could only find plantain and small chilli like bananas! I then woke bloke up telling him I was a dental hygienist from slough! that's all well and good but last night's has got me worried. Things I thought I'd forgotten about, or got over, but maybe I haven't.  Of course I'm a scientist though and know that none of this matters and it's just seeing his car yesterday that made me have that dream....Of course.

      Everybody is going on about it on the telly so it's unavoidable really, I'm talking about the Beckhams of course. The only reason I'm mentioning it here is that I'm angry about one particular aspect of this "story". Yes, I think it's a waste of time, it's papers just trying to make money, there are more important things to worry about, it's none of our business etc. etc. But the thing that gets me is that most people appear to be blaming Victoria for it!! Now hang on minute!  If  (and that's a big bloody if) David had an affair, why the fuck is it her fault? People seem to think that just because she didn't follow him straight away that it gives him the right to go fucking other women. I don't bloody think so. It's not that I feel sorry for her. I don't know her after all. It's that I hate the kind of example this is setting.  It's unfortunate, but some people seem to think that Alfie isn't just a film, but a set guidelines for relationships. Everybody deserves better than this, and not to be made to feel that it's their fault if they are treated this way. People broadcasting that it's Victoria's fault sets us back years (and I'm not just thinking of women here. I know women who treat men in a similar way) I know that some of it must be jealousy but there's no excuse for this conservative, old fashioned view that a woman should do what her husband tells her to do and that a person should accept their partner's infidelity if they haven't done exactly what their partner wanted on some occasion.

       Hello...?  No I'm not dead, I've just been busy. The last few weeks have consisted of doing a couple of presentations for work (scary) Seeing my flatmate off as she left to start her new job (sad) a major breakthrough at work (yipee-at long fucking last) a job offer (I can't even describe the joy) and sharing a room with bloke at my parents house (weird).  I'll probably have more to say later.....

       never mind the science, where's the common sense?  I've been reading the first part of the Guardian's  urlLink Chemical world special report  recently (and yes I know I'm way behind on my newspaper reading)and I found it (as usual where the Guardian and anything mildly scientific is concerned)wholly disappointing. The whole supplement is full of emotionally loaded statements such as; "propylene glycol is also used in antifreeze" (No shit! but isn't water too?) and even includes a completely irresponsible article declaring that sun cream may cause cancer. Then thereâs the usual ridiculous obsession with ânaturalâ chemicals. The idea being that these are some how better for you than "synthetic" chemicals. This is just nonsensical. without thinking for a second we can all list numerous drugs, therapeutic and otherwise, all derived directly from plants. Are they not having an effect on the body? Are they all good for us? Some of the chemicals found in plants are incredibly potent. Think of vinca alkaloids (such as vincristine) which are used to treat cancer  (they interfere with the cell cycle- stopping cell replication). Theyâre ânaturalâ but theyâre hardly good for you in normal circumstances.  I don't want to be completely flippant about this, I am concerned about chemicals we're exposed to (cosmetic wise I think it's probably best to use as little as possible) and I think that the points raised about possible contradictions between chemicals when using a combination of products and emerging nanotechnology in cosmetics are a particular concern.  However this scaremongering worries me. None of the articles were properly referenced (and I mean peer reviewed papers, not just something somebody says happens) in fact many articles are based on studies that have been discredited by other scientists and results that people think they might get -before the study has even been carried out. This type of journalism makes me sick, because it is presented in such a way, talking to leading scientists in their field âthough you only have the authorâs word for that- and mentioning studies and counter studies, so as to make it appear to be an unbiased review of the subject, at least to the general public.  I really resent this culture of fear that is being reinforced by articles like this. People donât need to be made to worry unnecessarily about things that might not happen (In fact depression and anxiety are  known  to cause cancer and other illnesses). Instead of making everybody worry about whether anti-wrinkle creams and suncream cause cancer journalists' time would be better spent helping to change the culture that has bred these products. White skinned people are meant to be white, and wrinkles are a fact of life. Of course itâll never happen. Iâm being completely idealistic. They want to sell papers, and the cosmetics industry want to sell products.

      I'm feeling a bit fed up today. My funding for my study is coming to an end and I'm going to be skint for months while I'm writing up. Not a happy prospect.  However i was cheered up this morning by a colleague who gave me a pair of cycling gloves (for my weight lifting class) because they're too small for him. A free pair of gloves can't be bad and they fit....well, like a glove. (also it's saved me Â£10, yipee)

      Just had a great weekend being spoilt rotten by bloke. It gets harder to leave every time.   Weather is great today and the last thing I want to be doing is trying to get reliable growth data from my stinky (and I mean really really smelly) bacteria. Sadly that's what I'm doing. However I'm planning a quick excursion down town to "run some errands" (read eat lunch on beach in peace and quiet and warm sunshine)

      Aghh! The dreaded mist and overcast skies of last week have descended on Aber again. Now it feels cold and damp and the contrast with this morning's weather makes it seem even worse. I'm still in work, just finishing off some things. I've felt happier, but a chat with my mate made me see that it's all worth it and the end is in sight.  If only the sun would stay out, I'm longing to swim in the sea again. Had a talk with A today. He's in a terrible mood. He always looks for the worst in any situation. I have a tendency to do this too. I just hope I don't get like him. I'm going to try not to. I think I can do it. I couldn't bite my tongue today when he moaned that his new office would be south facing and so would be boiling in the summer. For goodness sake, it'll be bright and sunny all day long, and warm in the winter, and also have a great view (because where he's moving to overlooks the sea) Even I can see that there are more than a few plus points to that.

      Everything went wrong today (well for a little while anyway-ie. till I left the lab) Experiments all fucked up, and I'm having a bit of a struggle trusting people I work with, which has made me question everybody. I probably only have myself to blame. I spent a little time a few days ago trying to impart some of my cynicism to my friend (not to be mean you understand, just to try to make her see how some people are. I was  trying  to be kind....)It didn't work of course, she just doesn't like to think people are like that (her words-not mine) but explaining my feelings on the matter got me a bit down. So I've been thinking too much about other peoples motives. Ah well a hot and sunny (you can but hope) weekend has arrived and I intend to pull myself out of this rut. I think I'll start with a few bottles of Sol (with a slice of lime of course), then I'll see where it goes from there ;)

       You learn something every day...  This is true, obviously, but it is usually something that you had no way of knowing previously or something insignificant. I do not, however, expect to be learning about things I should know,  about a town I have lived in for 5.5 years. on my caffeine seeking trip round co-op this morning (yeah still not sleeping well (No the caffeine doesn't help, but I have to function during the day) and the dreams are getting stranger and more disturbing every night)I bought the local newspaper. Fuck knows why! I've only bought it about 3 times before (because I was looking for a new car) and I found it the  to be the most right wing bigoted paper I've ever read. In fact I'd better throw it in the bin now for the sake of my health. My blood pressure rises every time I read another article about "binge-drinking", "alcohol-related incidents" and moving the drunks out of the town centre. Anyway the thing I learnt is that Aber has 6 night clubs. 6! Never! There are 2 that I can think of that can be loosely called (and do call themselves) night clubs. They have largish dancefloors taking up most of the floorspace and don't open till 10. I'm obviously not hanging round with the in-crowd. Somewhere between the castle ruins and Constitution hill, must lie 4 of Aber's premier night spots. They are probably lurking down undiscovered alleys with pink neon signs boasting "nite-club" or "members only".These clubs are so popular, so cock sure of pulling the crowds every night that they have forgone all advertising and publicity. Aber is not, as I had previously thought, a smallish town with a reasonably large number of venues for its size, but is actually Wales' answer to Blackpool. I must endeavour to find these night clubs or I might never visit them before I leave Aber. On the other hand, it may be that shitty old hotel bars with meager dance floors, pubs too small to sit in let alone dance in (and who'd want to in all that sawdust) and brasseries are classed as night clubs by journalists. Especially when they want to make the public believe that Aber is a dangerous place and the cause of it all is these establishments and that licensing hours must be reduced. For my part I do think alcohol turns some people into violent twats and I accept that people binge drink (including myself, it only takes 3 pints a night). However, I think that it is a cultural problem and not one caused solely by pubs having late licenses.

It was pouring down this morning, but now it's lovely.

      Just been talking to Mum, the conversation centred predominantly around paedophiles (hmm nice) but at the end she told me that Dad's work are collecting money for his retirement present (it's quite a big place with lots of members of staff that will be contributing) Mum was asking him what he might like (she knew there was about Â£250 collected) and he said that he'd noticed his A string on his violin was looking worn and maybe he could get that. Bless him, a whole set of 4 pretty good ones can't cost more than ~Â£30. It reminded me (today of all days after finally clearing my credit card bill from the last couple of months) that I've probably lost sight of the real value of money, and how disappointed my parents would be since it's something that they instilled in me.

      Today I got the results back from my experiment. They're not good, but they're not that bad either. I think I know why it hasn't worked and at least I've got my technique down. In fact I feel better about it all than I have done for ages.  It's strange but I find that set-backs with my work really help to motivate me. I was talking to a PhD student (first year) from another Uni doing similar molecular techniques as me a few months back. He told me he found his work boring, which after a while I concluded (and told him)was probably because it was all working and he hadn't had any problems getting results yet. I moan constantly about how down heartening it is to work for ages on something and get nothing that can be written up. In reality, though, I think it's the best way to learn and having to make myself think positively about a crap result really helps me appreciate the things I've accomplished so far and stops me taking it all for granted. Today is the first time I've felt like myself for weeks and I think it's because I was thinking that it was all (experiments - not writing) so easy and that I wasn't being stretched at all.

      The week so far; The first week of summer. Hit Monday on a low, had such a good weekend with Suze, Jo and bloke that I felt lonely on Sunday evening and depressed when I had to go into work. I've had some very vivid and fucked up dreams (not including yesterday's) about work. I've started reading Lolita (It's great to have a good book to read, even if the topic is a tad disturbing)and I've got drenched by the torrential rain that we've had for the past 2 days. A has finished work in the lab, and the others are going soon. i've been in contact with a bloke who's analysing some of my samples for me (not as scary as I thought) and I've moved bench and started on the last few bits of work (as long as my results from aforementioned bloke have worked) I've sorted out the pile of crap that's been building up at home and filed it away, and started to organise my papers etc. for writing up.  It still remains to be done though. In fact I've barely started  :(

      Shit! Just had a dream I was 7 months pregnant! I'm still disturbed by the thought. I was so relieved when I woke up but it took a few minutes to sink in that I wasn't really pregnant. That said, far weaker feelings and 'intuitions' have driven me to do pregnancy tests in the past, so maybe I'll get one just to be sure.

      Despite my outwardly pessimistic personality I am a born optimist when it comes to finding a decent morning news programme. Every morning I switch on the telly as though today might be different, that those two twats on the sofa aren't flirting with each other, and they actually manage to read the introduction to a story themselves - without having to read a line each. The problem with  urlLink 'Breakfast'  these days is that it's full of crap and very little news (see for yourself-follow the link. Jackie Chan, breakfast in Albert square, breakfast at wimbledon, breakfast euro 2004, 20 years of Crimewatch...) It's the TV equivalent of the daily mail (see "the changing face of the British family"), with lots of adverts for up and coming BBC programmes! What's more, all I hear about at the moment in the news section is football and tennis (and we haven't even started with the Olympics yet!) I know I should put radio 4 on or something, but I like to see people in a morning, and it's perhaps a little bit too serious for me first thing. so I just persevere, until about 7.15 that is, at which time I have discovered Friends is on S4C. Yes it's pap, no there's no news, but at least I don't spend my morning dreaming about kicking the shit out of smarmy faced Natasha.

      Yes yes yes, I know I should be working instead of mucking about with my blog but it only took a few minutes (even for a computer illiterate fool like me)besides ive been procrastinating for hours now, reading, surfing web and eating the most disgusting combinations and amounts of food you can think of. I am slowly coming round to what needs to be done, and it is getting done slowly. Trouble is I went on broadband in January to enable me to work at home easily, but as I have less to do in the lab and more to here I'm finding it's more than a little distracting....

      Oh dear, more  urlLink hooligans in Portugal  Hooligans are wankers. There's no discussion there. However, I'll be quite happy if England get chucked out of euro 2004 because of them. I've nothing against the game (and that's the operative word people, it's not life or death-unless you're on the wrong end of a fan and a smashed glass) and people who enjoy it, but I hate having to hear about it all the time. It takes over everything-pubs, TV schedules, news, people's conversations and even people's cars! (I fucking hate those flags) Now if only there was a way to get rid of wimbledon I'd be a happy bunny. Too much TV coverage and too much optimism for Tim Henman. sigh

      I want a cigarette today. I have a craving, a desire for that horrible ashy taste. Well actually no, just the nicotine rush afterwards. It's a funny thing but I haven't felt like this since September when I vowed to stop smoking (I never did it that much but it was becoming a habit, and I was liking it too much. I didn't want to become hopelessly addicted) I'm not having one, but the fact that I woke up wanting one is indicative of how badly I'm coping with my work. Also I'm waking up at 5 every morning (well for the past 6 nights) then I can't get out of bed when I should. It's just an avoidance strategy, a way of procrastinating, but it's crap and it makes me hate myself for being so lazy and then I feel tired all day because I've overslept. My body is letting me down. Trying to make me start smoking again, as though that's going to help my work, and making me sleep too long. Sometimes I feel as though I have very little control and I worry that I'll never regain it and I will completely fuck up.

      In the lab still. Fair enough really, I took the afternoon off to spend it with my sister before she left. I feel really lonely though. It's probably the reason I've stayed in all this time, just doing a little bit more and a little bit more work. Avoidance. I've felt a bit weird all day. I think it was having my sister to stay that has made me feel like this. It's been great seeing her. We spent the evenings walking and watching telly together and just talking. In fact all the things I don't do normally during the week. It's not just that there aren't many people around, I can't really afford the time anyway if I'm going to have time out at the weekend. I'm sure I'll feel better when I've slept, but I'll be glad when the fucking thing is written up.

      I saw the picture on the front of  urlLink The Guardian  today and was surprised to find tears welling up in my eyes.

Doubtless the photo had the desired effect on me, but it really set me thinking about what might have been.

      Saw Mum and dad last night (they're down here on holiday)I love my Mum and Dad dearly, and I'm glad to see that although they are getting a bit old now they are still in good health and as sharp as ever, but sometimes I have to laugh at the way they do things. They have their seats in the car in the most upright position possible, you know almost tipping forwards. I find it really uncomfortable if I sit in the front. I just don't know how they manage, especially with the heater on full belt-even on a relatively warm day. They've even now, I noticed, started carrying a huge bag of plastic cutlery (in the pocket behind the passenger seat) so they can stop and have a picnic anywhere they want.  Of course when I met them yesterday they had the car manual out, to check what a light meant on the dashboard, and after some discussion decided that it was the rain that caused it! (hmmm ok) We went for a lovely meal, and we had a really good chat. (something that at one stage of my teenage years I never thought would be possible) At the end of the meal my Dad (in the way that only older people can manage) got talking to our waiter. In a frighteningly short length of time he had ascertained the lad's age, the course he was doing at uni, what year he was in, how often he worked at the pub, what he wanted to do after he finished and how much debt he was in! Oh no, not student debt! This started up a whole conversation, and when he left the table to get our bill my Dad wouldn't stop going on about what a nice lad he was and how dreadful it was that students have to pay so much these days, when he got his paid for by the government. We got the bill and when he walked past again my Dad thrust a fiver in his hand with a conspiratorial wink.  God I love my parents :)

      Today I had a really horrible experience with a couple in the block of flats next door.&nbsp;The cause of it was them believing that I had parked in their car parking spot (which I had, but it's not their spot, it's just that they've "parked in that spot for 4 years" besides there were many other spaces, the nearest just 3 spaces away)  The whole thing was very petty, but what really upset me was the way they spoke to me.&nbsp;Being English I haven't ever been the target of racist remarks before, but today I felt the extent to which some people dislike me, and I think&nbsp;it is&nbsp;purely because I am English, and quite probably because I am young-and therefore more than likely a student.  The man told me I was an "in-comer" and that they had lived here 4 years. When I explained that I had lived here 2.5 years, and 6 years in Aber as a whole, the woman said that&nbsp;they " owned"  their&nbsp;flat and that she was "from a long standing Aberystwyth family" (implying that she was better than me, or had&nbsp;more rights than me to that&nbsp;car parking space ?!?)  I'm so angry. I haven't actually done anything wrong. It really upsets me that 2 people who don't even know me could find it necessary&nbsp;to ruin my&nbsp;day, interrupt my meal and just be rude to me simply because they wanted that particular parking space. The fact that they had such venom, such clear dislike of me really hurt me. They don't know me, but they seemed to make assumptions about me as soon as they saw me and decided it was acceptable to tell me that I wasn't entitled to the same as them because I wasn't originally from round here. I know it's a&nbsp;pathetic argument but that's just the point isn't it?&nbsp;The fact people can feel that strongly about my origins in relation to&nbsp;a car parking space&nbsp;scares me. What if it was something really important? What bloody chance have asylum seekers got trying to make peaceful lives for themselves in Britain if there is this much resentment between people from different regions?  I've said it before and I'll say it again; There are some people in Wales who need to start accepting that other people in the world move around and don't just stay in the same place all their lives. Get the fuck over it!  (I could also get started on how the implication that my not owning my flat and therefore being inadequate pisses me off and that since house prices (and short term contract jobs) mean that more people will be renting in the future it's time that opinions in Britain&nbsp;changed. But then I might be in danger of ranting, and I don't want that)&nbsp;

      I can't be alone in the world wishing that Robert Winston would shut up. His recent  urlLink outburst directed towards Prince Charles  has just made me dislike him even more.  I happen to think that Prince Charles is great at raising public and political awareness about issues. Let's face it, the man has a lot of time and resources at his disposal to enable him to actually research these areas that concern him and many others. Besides anybody who tries to make a bit of trouble for greedy politicians is alright by me. I know he gets it a bit wrong sometimes, but generally I think he's right to make people sit up and listen. In the  urlLink Indie article  he explains that it is nanoparticles that really concern him (and not robots) and I for one think he's right in asking for more research into the effects of such compounds. The effect of using nanoparticles in contact with the skin may be very different from ordinary sized particles. I think the point is here that we just don't know, and a real effort to reassure people with facts is required. Winston's and other people's reactions to Charle's opinion doesn't help the situation. This kind of attitude is precisely what makes people suspicious in the first place.  Scientists must be able to justify what they do, and it mustn't be a case of "we  can  do it, so we  will  do it"

      I may not be a London call girl or even have a vaguely interesting life but that doesn't stop a lot of people, and so it wont stop me. I'm going to write a book when this is all over. I'll call it "redbull diary". I'm sure loads of people would like to read about my selfish struggle to complete my PhD. Imagine how I could  really  dig deep into my psyche and explore my neuroses to the full. Then again....

      Now I can't sit here and slag off the uni. I'd probably get kicked out-which, tempting as it is at the moment, wont really help matters and besides on the whole I like the University and the department. (well I'd have to spend 6 years here wouldn't I ?) I will say this however. The administration staff are very efficient. So efficient in fact that they chose to send me a letter informing me that I will no longer be registered with them in 2.5 months, and that if I want to do anything in uni I have to pay and implying that I'm running over the allowed time to do my degree! They chose to send me this letter as I have about 6 weeks of experiments to do when I'm the most stressed I've ever been. They chose to send it in July, when everybody I've tried to contact about it is off on holiday. They chose to send it in internal mail so that I received it at 6pm, when there was nobody at work, and no way I could contact them about it. I'm really pissed off. I have issues with what the letter's actually saying, and suspicions that the reason I've received it is because of the situation involving my supervisor moving away. I understand that they're covering their backs, and that they're just doing their jobs, but I feel like I'm having to sort out all this crap and plead with them to allow me access to the library when surely the point of the university at this stage is to help enable me to write up, not to add more stress to an already overloaded brain.

      I'm having another emotional day. I'm afraid I've been sobbing in the office for over an hour, and then wasting some time looking for hints on helping me write up. There were many many websites and articles, some with very complex models of thesis writing!?! which I scanned and then realised that It'd take 3 months to decide how I was going to do it if I read the whole article.  urlLink This one  I liked though. It made me chuckle a bit, and it's nice to know that not feeling human is normal.  (will substitute Belgian beer with Mexican beer though ;) )

       Norge   well I've had a hectic time the last few days, but (apart from living in other peoples pockets) I had a fantastic time.  I loved Norway. I will have to go back so that I can see more of it (I'll have to get some more money first, the food and drink is very very expensive).  More importantly of course it was my friend's wedding (and the first one I'd ever been to) It was great. I had tears in my eyes as I saw her walking down the aisle with a nervous smile and eyes fixed straight ahead. Everything was beautiful. The weather, the church, the dress, the meal (2 main courses of reindeer!), the speeches, the guests... I could go on. I left (and I don't think I was alone in this) to go to bed feeling happy and content, knowing that 2 people who should be together were, and that the world is sometimes a very lovely place. (soppy I know, but both bride and groom are great people and deserve all the happiness in the world)

       Prozac in Drinking Water  Thanks to  urlLink badly dubbed boy  for drawing my attention to  urlLink this  I have a strangely paranoid thought that this isn't the result of so many people being prescribed the drug, but may actually be deliberate. Perhaps the government are spiking our drinking water to make us forget about the war in Iraq etc... Anyway, back to my book. I'm reading nineteen eighty four....
