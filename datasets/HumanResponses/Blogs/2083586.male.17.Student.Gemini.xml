      Ok. My life is a lil on the boring side, but crazy stuff still happens...kinda strange stuff even. As of right this second stuff is good, I have my friends, my music, my bed, my lady friend, and my blog. Simple as that. Sorta. What to say...What to say... I dunno I'm not good at talking "Me and words aren't goodly." (HA! tell me what movie that's from and i'll be surprized).  Well as far as my music goes, I listen to it I play it and I try to write it. Most of my attempts at wrinting fail, but I have two good ones. I'm not in a band, but I'm involved in a little side project with Austin, we're called Music in the AM, we have one song...kinda sad but we've only met to write and play under that name once so it's cool. I really want to convince Austin that we should get people to play with us and play at battle of the bands, but I don't think he'll do it. I'm looking to join or start a new band but as of yet I've been rather unsuccessful, so if you have any leads call me or IM me.  Fun stuff I guess. Well I'm gonna check out, I'll see you around I guess.                                                                                                                   -mike

      hmmmmmmm spring break a time of much coolness i guess. just saw eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, it was good infact it was for sure teh best movie i've seen all year tied with chasing amy. it probably will hold it's title til i see kill bill v2. truth be told im actually very bored so if at anytime durring break you wanna do soemthing just call me or im me or whatever.  i need a date, so if you would like to go on a date with me just tell me and i shall be happy to do so. relationships are very complicated and sometimes i get the feeling that i'm not clear headed enough to handle one but then again if i was clear headed enough were would the challenge be? so in coclussion don't do drugs, don't try to hurt somone on purpose, and stay in school, and you'll be fine or atleast not dead.  -mike

      "i wanna make it! i wanna make it witchu." and "the only tihng i know for sure is what i wanna do." hmmmmmmmm.... I think I've found something seriously cool. for more into it visit www.thefade.net the fan site to what i tihnk is one of the greatest bands ever, along with my new hub for discovering countless new bands, since the members are all band whores. yeah seriously good stuff.  well my plans kinda fell thru so right now im tryin to hook up with pat along with listening to my crazy stoner rock. fun stuff. qotsa eagles of death metal, mondo gernerator, and of course the desert sessions. good times. just groovin' and chillin'....yeah.......my mind is free of most of my previous burden. i think i'm done with that, unless of course something very cool happens. but i doubt it. i have to find someone else now...i feel kinda shallow considering that im already thinking of other girls. oh well i have a penis what more can i say? (ha ha ha) wow im seeriously pathetic.  rollin just to keep on rollin right? yeah you know what i mean. sigh. ths has been a strange good day.   -mike

Well as afr as stuff goes i can't complain, although i haven't as of yet found a band, aside from the one with jeff. (don't get me wrong, i will love the band with jeff and kc, but i would also like to get involved in a band that might play some of the qotsa songs im interested in).  no gf as of yet, although there are some really good prospects, idk if im all that interested in having another gf for while, or atleast til after prom. i know some way im going to get tricked into going...damnit.  that's really about it i guess, im kinda bored.  -mike

I ordered the new eagles of death metal album, i found out new qotsa ep comes out april 20th, i got incubus tics, finally got around to buying the vines' cd (very good btw, listening to it right now), i played dnd for 9 hours (dear god i need a life), my bass teacher told me "you really need to find a band to play in, you could totally kick ass if you wanted", and um well i suppose that's it....oh yeah a Georgia Tech better kick some ass and win bc they are going all the way! i hate basket ball btw but my love for any and all college sport out weighs my hate for basketball.  -mike

I bet he misses my trunk. yeah...he probably does. anyway, this weekend was probably better then my whole spring break. lol white castle. lol those drinks were really old. lol 3 hours of sleep. lol good times. damnit i'm really geting sick of the phrase lol. it seriously needs to die, thus i shall stop using it for good. maybe i'll just use ha ha ha or something stupid and pointless like that.

      ok saturday was fun i guess. a quick sum up if anyone out there cares. concert was pretty cool, lots of solos, i'd like to say ill do one next year, but im pretty lazy so probably not. after the concert we were talking to people outside and got traped putting stools away. lost her in the crowd, no big deal she was going out with a few friends afterwards so i just came home.  now i have an ap us project to do from start to finish in one day. i think i did this to myself last time but atleast i had some research done, and of course this time i don't. here's my plan: research write/copy-ish paper then make a huge timeline and a poster with topics from the paper. it should be as boring if not more boring then my last one. but my last one i got a 60/50 for teaching him something. i tihnk mr. gunka thinks i'm a neat guy, sometimes he talks to me about stuff after school or b4 school. mostly bc i know more about history and politics then a let on and he knows that. it sucks knowing stuff against ur will, damn u father for being a politician, and damn u politcs bc i know somehow im going to get invovled.....shit  -mike

      ok guys wow... prom was really really really cool. it was just wow. hmmm well i can't really say anything else except for it was really fun, mostly because my head's spinning from being tired and i'm confused about some things, but it's the good kind of confusion, the kind that keeps you from making a mistake (if that last part made any sense im proud of you). well i can't think of anything else except to say it was probably the most fun i've ever had in a long long time.  -mike

      yay for not updating!!! well i guess there's a lot to say. &nbsp; choir camp was great. lots of fun blah blah blah. im kinda sad it was my first and last one. maybe if im still around when im older ill keep in touch and try to be one of the adults there, that'd be sweet...but i doubt it'll happen. &nbsp; the thing with sarah's going well. slow but great. aside from that i wont say anything else. &nbsp; well i guess that's it.

      I was watching High Fidelity for like the 159th time and i actually made a top five rescording artist list for myslef.  5. Miranda Sound 4. Hot Hot Heat & Guster (i didn't want to kick Miranda Sound off the list by taking hours and making a decision between the two) 3. The Red Light Sting (i only have one of their singles but i love it...a bit too much) 2. =W=eezer 1. Queens of the Stone Age...i dont fucking care what any of you say. They're great but i cant stand the songs "No One Knows" and "Go with the Flow" b/c you people ruined them!!!
