      OK, sorry 'bout the total and complete lack of posts for the weekend. I've got a half hour before my psych class - the last actual class for the whole quarter! - so I'm gonna post and make it long. I fixed my bike today, by the way. It was pretty messed up for a while, and I didn't quite get it all fixed up yet. There's still a problem with the shifter. Once I get home to my allen wrench, though, that will all change. I listened to Flying Man for awhile at home. Yeah, from EarthBound. The odd thing is, it was actually originally written with lyrics. Pretty sappy ones, but still... I also listened to Strong Bad's techno music. Now, imagine a trumpet fanfare in your head. Done? Good. Now for the sentence to accompany it. I got signed up on SeasonsRO today! Problem is, after I had reached level 10, the server shut down, so I dunno if it saved my character or not. I didn't even get a chance to change job to a swordsman... Oh well. I haven't touched EarthBound in awhile.... I don't feel like playing it, for some reason. I wonder when SeasonsRO will be up again? Yeah, that was pretty off the wall. But so am I. It just occurred to me... I find it odd that someone who is always told he needs a psychologist is taking a psychology class. Do you? Yes, that was a plea for comments. I haven't gotten a comment since that Edwina person that I don't even know. I'm wondering if she's actually someone I DO know using a pseudonym... Okay, gotta go do some... Stuff... Yeah. Then head to psych class. SMAAAASH!! y'all later.

      Okay, I just got back from this spring banquet thing with the Inside-Out group where I got to see my buddy Seth in person for the first time since April, I think. I told him the story of the soggy hugger. Yes, tell you I shall, young Padawan. Not in Yoda-speak though. |*3|2|-|4|*5 ][|\| 13375|*34|&#60? No. In any case, I was hanging out in Foster Hall talking to some people. A long, long time ago. Not in a galaxy far away though. One of them, by the name of Cyndi-Lou, tries to hug me! So, obviously, I run, 'coz this chick I don't even know is trying to hug me! So she chases me and grabs my bag, which I drop and keep going. I get away for long enough that she gives up and drops my bag, and then I go get it. But this person would make a good hunter, see, 'coz she was using the bag as bait. I still got away from her this time. Anyways, that was a long time ago, back at the start of Winter quarter. Now, they start doing this festival thing. They have this "Human Bowling" alley, where they strap you into a round cage and hurl you at large wood objects called "pins." I see Cyndi, and try to get into the cage, hoping that she wouldn't see me, but it was hopeless. She yelled, "Hey! You're 'the one that got away!'" So I run, but she catches me this time 'coz I messed up my knee coming back from Inside-Outside, which I shall tell y'all about later. In any case, she hugs me, but the problem was, she was soaking wet from a squirt-gun fight or something, so I was damp for the next few hours. Lesson: Let them hug you while they're dry! Some fun things also happened at the spring banquet. A guy caught his napkin on fire, but Ben wasn't quick enough with the camera. Someone put it out with lemonade before he could get a picture. Oh, yeah. The knee injury. I hit the curb coming back from Inside-Outside and ate dirt. Figuratively, for all the morons who think that I actually consumed soil. I messed up my knee, but not too badly. I did cripple my bike though, which really sucks. So I'm gonna go play EarthBound now. SMAAAASH!! ya later.

      Noon-Day went great, except that I got real dizzy. Dehydration isn't fun. The worst of it is, the nearest drinking fountain was missing the spigot. That's the part that makes everything go in a straight line. I managed to ride my bike down to the college without killing myself and got a good long drink. And filled my water bottle. And drank half of it on my way to the computer to pound this post out. So I'm gonna refill it and go hang out at the amphitheater 'till 727. See y'all.

      Yep, I got that Pepto-Bismol song stuck in my head. One of the worst possible things... Especially if you break out singing it in public. Also, today is this Inside-Outside thing with the Noon-Day and 727 stuff. We got the sun we prayed for, with great intensity. I suppose it's a matter of opinion whether or not that's good... I have my english paper done, but I can't turn it in yet. Not 'till Friday, which is tomorrow. My art final went crappy, and I don't care how friggin' cool the instructor is, I'm never taking art again. It was a nightmare. There's also this Morp thing tomorrow night, but the chicks are supposed to ask the guys. Nobody's asked me yet, but nobody's surprised about that either. In any case (Hi, Ben!), the pizza in the cafeteria is scheduled to be done now, so I'm gonna go get lunch. Yay, Pepto-Bismol!

      OK, this is my first post. I assume that this thing automatically dates it, but in case it doesn't, it's Wednesday, June 2nd, 2004. Yeah. I know, the template looks goth, but hey. At least it wasn't the Day-Glo orange and pink one. My art final is today, but I have a short little break right now. I really don't like that art class, but the instructor's a cool guy. Take Ray Cooper's classes. Yeah. My english final paper is due Friday, and then I'm free of that class' clutches, too. I'm actually getting a good grade! Woohoo! Okay then... My psych final is a week from today, and I have plenty of time to study. Nonetheless, I need to kick some serious 455 on this exam if I want to pass it. Okay, that's it for the ranting about my college classes. I have a L. 6 Dragon character on Crossfire. I recently acquired a new code for my Earthbound game, too. Now I can get out of bed, go out, walk THROUGH the roadblock down through Onett, walk THROUGH the roadblock, waltz right on in to Twoson, walk around until I find the portion of the map with the Dusty Dunes/Threed tunnel, stay inside the walls so the ghosts can't get me, so on and so forth, and all in all, get to Magnet Hill before I've even SEEN the Lilliput Steps. Cool, huh? I'm done now. And yes, the Crossfire thing was just random idiocy.
