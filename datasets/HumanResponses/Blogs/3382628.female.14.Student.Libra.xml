      my shoulders are in excruciating pain. but it feels kind of nice. i had to carry my guitar and amp up redwood then all the way to the end of arlene. i wanted to drop the damned amp but surpsrisingly i do have a wee bit of common sense. instead i just inwardly yelled at myself for wearing a beanie, 2 shirts, and pajama pants on a day like this. evan taught me how to play sunshine of your love...  i went into the big room at the end of spanish and just randomly walked up to harris and asked if smyth was ever coming back. he said no, so i just turned around and went back to shickos room. i think he was a bit perplexed cuz he dragged me back out and made me tell him why i asked. i did, and now everytime i talk to him he gets all melty-looking and sympathetic. i wanted to take the pencil out from behind his ear and poke out his eyes. or maybe just hide it, he gets really frustrated when he reaches up and cant find his pencil. very funny.   gotta light up the barbie and clean el guitaro with butane, later!

      when you see the title of a blog that looks like the one above, it means its just about my day, and not something odd i had to say.   i woke up to the funny popping noise my alarm clock makes, pulled the plug before it went off, and then spent 4 minutes resetting the time. i got back in bed for 26 minutes and played with my lamp switch. then i got out of bed, got in the shower, and for some strange reason couldnt make the water cold so i had to take a warm shower. herbal essences and all that good stuff *orgasm*. took 10 minutes just to dry off, then finally opened the door to the bathroom wearing the same exact thing i was wearing when i went in. didnt brush hair. went upstairs, opened the fridge and then immediately closed it again. opened the pantry, didnt look in, closed pantry door. went back downstairs 30 seconds later and logged on to AIM. put on an away message. called alessandra, explained unfortunate bike problems, asked her to give me a ride. of course she said yes. went to bathroom again, brushed hair with moms brush to piss her off (i shed a lot), and decided i was too lazy to blow dry it so i just braided it and put on a beanie. god awful look for me, shows how lazy i can be. i pondered over the drawers in my armoir and then pulled out the obvious derailleur-ripped jeans, shortys shirt, connors bull head sweatshirt (meant to give it back, oopsie), and blue ankle socks. i got dressed. thats a no-brainer. logged off AIM, grabbed my guitar, and went to sit on the couch to wait for alessandra to call and tell me she was leaving to so i could walk down to 7-11 and wait for her to pick me up. threw day-old croutons at my tabby cat. hed freak out, stand up, circle around on his pillow, lay down, stare at me for about 2 minutes, then close his eyes. then id throw another crouton. this went on for 20 minutes until alessandra called and i walked to 7-11 with my guitar. sat at the bus stop sleeping on my knees until she drove up. got in car. linda (her mom) asked me what the philosophy was about wearing guys sweatshirts. i blabbed some kind of excuse and moped until we came across evan and 2 other people walking up sunset. offered them a ride. they had to sit on the floor of the van. alessandra didnt close the sliding door all the way and evan had to hold in shut. arrived at school. walked into science late, burgess didnt give a shit of course. insulted mr.burgess for an hour and a half and pretended to be extremely interested in the physics behind riding a bike. damn fruitcake laughs at everything. in between insults and taking notes i cleaned sticker goo off my guitar. went to break, was mobbed by people wanting to play my cheap-ass guitar. went to math. halkyard lectured us again. i sat admiring the remnants of last weeks orange explosion on the back mathroom wall. good old joel. copied down the HW, received full credit. was repremanded for not doing POW 15. nick, joel and i attempted to serenade halkyard with another round of "three's" but it was a pretty lame attempt. we'll try again thursday. went to lunch, more mobbing, sat on grass while alessandra gave me an arm hickey. went to advisory. threw sticks at connor and ben. more insulting burgess. went to break. dont remember it. went to art elective. made fun of steve's shiny head. left room, went to annoy burgess with kailey. he blabbed on about weed prices being lowered and then tried to dump his lifes story on us. after i was interrupted several times with "i got stepped on by a bear once" and "my friends and i drove all the way to canada in less than 24 hours..." i left kailey to suffer on her own. wandered around school, begged angela for advil. school got out, went to bus stop, rode home, walked up redwood with my guitar. mom came home:  "WHY THE HELL ARE THERE CROUTONS ALL OVER THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR?!"   later

      i came up with the brilliant idea to dump my thoughts in here while blogging for english. im not sure whether to thank or maim mr.wells.   so theres this little guy, hes sitting up on top of my monitor right? well he keeps yelling these random things like "onions!" or "hanging freely!" or "patriots lost to cambodia!" i swear, hes insane. hes wearing a green top hat, striped bondage pants and what seems to be a lace doily. he cant be more than 4 inches tall...his mother must make his clothes...  i have a paranoia. of things that make small popping noises. well, not popping. like someone letting the cover of a textbook fall shut, or dropping it on tile floor. wow i dunno but so many things make this noise that causes me to go into fits of spasms. it sounds too much like my alarm clock. see, right before the actual alarm goes off, you hear a very faint electrical sort of "pop". i hear it in mid-conciousness though, so the alarm always comes as a surprise. thus, when i hear a popping noise, i automatically think 'GAHH ALARM!" and wait in horror for a few seconds until i realize im sitting in the spanish room, shicko rambling about no respect...or something similar...are those...horns?? growing...? yeah anyways then i come to my senses, shaking slightly but nevertheless releived.   i need a new alarm clock

      well its 2 days until i leave alabama. i made a huge mistake by going out with chris. see the thing is, theres nothing wrong with him, but everytime i think about him i get really pissed off. haha sounds like the ideal boyfriend hum? w/e tho when i leave here i wont have to worry about the little bitch anymore.   so i have this idea...i should shave my head and where a beanie everywhere, then i wouldnt have to worry about guys liking me, so i can be totally free and never have to ponder how to get someone off my back. doesnt that sound nice? id look nice and ugly and i could laugh at the people laughing at me =) yay.  i went white water rafting yesterday, it was bull. our guide was some chick who was all scared for our safety and tried as hard as she could not to let us fall out. last year, our guuide was TRYING to make us fall out. it was bomb...yea anyway the little annoying peice of shit got on everyones nerves so i finally just jumped out and when she came to get me back in i went in another raft&nbsp;and stayed there for the last 20 minutes. i left a comment at the main office saying what a pussy she was. should teach her. the kayaker dude who was filming us was cool tho. he let me hang on to the back of his truck when he was riding around dropping off the kayaking paddles.   i think i am steadily getting a shorter temper. im like mount st. helens, except when i blow up my head wont be flat on top, and no one will be able to veiw me from afar through their kitchen window in portland, oregon.

      saturday night after ellies dad told us that him and my mom are getting married, we were a little bit mad. we went over to her friend sarahs house with a water bottle of vodka that darby (ellies brother) so generously donated. hes not mad, just morbidly amused. i guess ill have new siblings soon.   anyway i had half the bottle, nothing happened. ellie was drunk after about 1/6 of it. i wish i were a lightweight.  they are getting married on the fucking beach in fucking new zealand how fucking kiwi is that? chris is from fucking new zealand and we were fucking gonna go on a fucking vacation but now its turning into some fucking honeymoon getaway where us fucking kids have to entertain our fucking selves in some fucking lame-ass country on the other side of the fucking world.  fuck.  god i cant wait.
