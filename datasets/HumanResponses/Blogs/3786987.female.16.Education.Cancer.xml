        A boring day it may be, realising how crappy ms fong can be... Before you knew it, it is break time for me!!! Time passes real fast... Having to crack algebraic expressions, sure it is hell for me... Making me wanting to end my life early!!! I've taken a virtual trip to Turkey, beautiful place counting on the scenery... But now snapping back to reality, knowing having not done my big proj work, I went to get it done quickly...     Still wanting my beauty sleep, I did it anyohow and got it done finally~ damn am i so tired now, i want my sleepies and my sweet ol' dreamies.. good night for now, so quit reading & stop thinking what kinda crappy diary entry this is!~!~!~!~! ( It is my 1st diary entry so dont think much of it &amp; I am sharing this blogspotty with pei xuanie *winkz* ;o) )    Lotsa Punches,  JoNg

         If     dreams were made and given to me,        Why doesnt it comes true.        I'd force myself to sleep,        Just so that&nbsp;my dreams would&nbsp;continue.           &nbsp;     If 3 wishes was given to Aladdin        And I was only&nbsp;just given 2,        I'll make the whole full use of it.        I'd wish all the wonderful dreams I had would just come true,        And the other is that I'd would give it to you.           &nbsp;     If my tears could write a sentimental song,        I'd give you and the whole world to hear.        It would definitely explain how I really feel.   &nbsp;        &nbsp;     Though things dont always work out the way i want it to,        But things have a way of working out.        And sometimes they work out better than I never dreamed they could.        This may be one of those times.           &nbsp;     But, I know dreams are&nbsp;dreams        And that it wouldnt be real,        Until you&nbsp;you reach out for&nbsp;it.        And wishes are wishes        Which seldom comes true,        Just as you wanted it to.        My tears can never write a sentimental song,        But it drops for someone like you.   &nbsp;     Happiness of another person,        Is essential to your own.           &nbsp;        &nbsp;        &nbsp;      Copyright Of SAY JONG JONG.

      A fun & interesting day. RHD it is today, borrowed Indian ethnic costume from mel, cool & nice it was. We won 2nd place in the rap competition and 3rd place in the mascot competition. Our class 4N2 mascot "THE RISING DRAGON". After, we went out with boon sim, limin, pei xuan, li neng, jude, seng wee and boon's friend to Orchard and Suntec. Saw Dawood too~ Went out with them till "Ballet Time" and "danced till quite late" though on a school night, soon it was time to go home, had lotsa fun with em. A fun & interesting day it was, had a great time.                                       Love, Jong

       urlLink     The greatness comes not when things go always good for you. But the greatness comes when you're really tested, when you take some knocks, some disappointments, when sadness comes. Because only if you've been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.  Jong
