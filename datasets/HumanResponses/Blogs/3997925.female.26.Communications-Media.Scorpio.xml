      &nbsp; jeremiah's reminders: learn to suffer patiently and persevere in doing good things.  of the two, i think i should work on the second reminder more. not that i am patient in enduring sufferings but doing good things is more challenging for me.  at this time, i need not aspire to do one grand thing. i should instead concetrate on how i deal with and treat my brothers and sisters in Christ. i have&nbsp;to&nbsp;bear in mind what Matthew (7:1) said, stop judging that you may not be judge.&nbsp;he added&nbsp;(7:3),&nbsp;why do you notice the splinter in your brothers eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own eye?  i am far from being perfect. but&nbsp;i should learn to accept my imperfections and in the process learn to accept the imperfections of others as well. loving&nbsp;thosei tend to consider "unlovable" is my immediate mission for myself. success rate so far is 50%. far from an impressive 100% but i know i will soon get there. that, through personal conviction and guidance from God!

      "Have you seen him whom my heart loves? ... Do not arouse, do not stir up love before its own time"&nbsp; - Songs 3:3,5  I've always wondered why i remain "loveless", why i've always been loveless. I have gazillions of crushes... i actually find this guy i met "again" this morning as striking, meaning, crush-material. a photographer, he has a lot of character, exudes oodles of appeal. But my crushes remain as that... crushes.  But as Kahlil Gibran said, and think not you can direct the course of love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.&nbsp;Do I need to do anything for love to find me worthy? I do hope that I'd be considered worthy... soon!  For now, I pray to the Lord that He may guide and protect him (whoever he may be) all the time. Swerte mo, hindi pa tayo nagiging tayo pinagdadasal na kita. Hehehe =P   "Have you seen him whom my heart loves?" Am sure the Lord has. Meantime, I will wait for that time when I'd finally meet and see him.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      11:28 "Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."  (When we are too busy for God, we are busier than He intended us to be.)   8:21-22 "Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times but seventy-seven times."   24:44 "You also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect."

      63:7 "Because You have been my help, therefore in the shadow of Your wings, I will rejoice"  (When man views his own circumstances, he is given to despair; when he sees God's deliverance, he is given to praise.)  119:82 "Though parched and exhausted with waiting, I have not forgotten your commands."  123 "Like the eyes of a servant on the hand of her mistress, so our eyes are on the Lord our God until He show His mercy."
