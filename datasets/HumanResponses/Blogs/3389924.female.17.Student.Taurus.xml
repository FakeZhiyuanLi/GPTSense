      well! originally i had a thing at xanga.com but then ryan told me that i should make a blogger.com one so here we are. anyways tomorrow is my canoeing trip with adventure ed and that should be cool. friday to saturday is relay for life. sunday to tuesday is the camping trip! im going to have a very busy weekend indeed. not much is going on haha. im off my meds for the time being and im not sure how i feel about that. croo is going good, im officially a lighting flunkie, one of noah's "babies" as he calls us, that or we are his lighting bitches/wenches. haha. my birthday wasnt horrible but it wasnt great either. emma never said happy birthday to me which really made me sad. i can live with her not wanting to be friends but the least she could have done would have been to acknowledge my birthday. hell i called her from florida and even got her a brithday present. but i guess you cant stop people from being bitches and screwing you over. hell, ive lost enough friends in the past couple years to know that much. mr moran played his guitar and sang for us in class yesterday, it was quite enjoyable. anyways i really need to find a guy to hang out with again, either that or i need to find some time to chill with torey. we definitely had some good times. oh does anyone know the new mookie site? stupid computer people at school blocked the mookie.x7h.com one. oh well! amanda and laura called me on my brithday and that definitely increased my mood to happy at least. im going to ron of japan tonight with my aunt and grandparents so i need to go and work on homework now. love you all lots!

      im back from oregon! i had such a great time. i went camping for three days with my cousin and aunt. lets see, we went to this kick ass waterpark/amusement park in washington. i got to go take a tour of Western Oregon University (WOU) and Willamette University. i liked both but i liked WOU better. it was really nice. one day we went to OMSI (oregon museum of science and industry) with the kids that my cousin is a nanny for. my aunt took me and my little cousin whos 1 to the zoo also. i got to take a ride on the vespa, learned how to drive a stick shift. the entire trip was great. the puppies are SO cute. theres 8 of them and they are 4 weeks old so i got to hang around them a lot and help take care of them. well i g2g ill write more later about my trip...

      this is most likely going to be my last post until i get back from oregon. anyways i went to panera with laura for lunch. then we went scandalous skirt shoppping! i have to admit that it was lots of fun trying on way too short skirts. laura ended up buying one. shes got the body to pull it off without looking too ho ish, i dont haha. anyways tonight dad is bbqing and then after dinner im going back to lauras. were going to rent a movie and chill. her mom is going to work on my scrapbook while im gone so shes going to interview me on my pictures. gd i was so pissed this afternoon. i went to get gas, and i always put my gas cap on the trunk while i fill up my tank. anyways i drive away, get all the way to church and crawford (i went to a gas station by old orchard) and realize i didnt put the cap back on. so i drive back to the gas station but its no where in sight. im pretty sure it got run over. anyways it cost 20 bucks to buy a new gas cap and it just really made me mad that i forgot cause i always ALMOST forget. laura was with me and i just tensed up and stopped talking and she was like, hey its ok, you can get a new one, your dad wasnt mad about it so dont worry. so she made me feel better but i totally blew up at dad and i feel bad that i took it out on him. he went out on his way home and bought me a new one too. anyways ive gotta go and finish packing. were leaving for the airport about quarter to 7 tomorrow morning. FUN! love you lots ryan! have a great move!

      went to the gap with laura to return some stuff and i got a pair of jeans. then we went thrift store shopping! i love thrift stores haha. anyways i have no idea what im going to do tonight. last night we went to flattop and then bowling, thats me, tay, laura, torey and chuck. to tell the truth, chuck was an asshole the entire ride home, talking bout how i should let him drive. then the entire car agreed and chuck was like, youve been in two accidents, i havent been in any. then taylor was like, what about the fire hydrant. that counts as an accident. i really cant belive she brought that up, ive only told a couple of people and it just really pissed me off that she said something. i mean, i dont spread shit she tells me. gd damnit, im just really upset with the majority of my friends right now. aynways i need to go clean my room

      friday i went over to sarah and annie's house about 5.  i ended up going home at 7 cause joe came home but then he went out with ben so i ended up eating dinner at home. then about 845 dani picked me up and we went to go see The Village...the 925 show ended up being sold out so we waited around and saw the 1030 show. i really liked it but the ending was sorta a let down. the movie was nothing like i thought it would be tho. but i thought it was good. anyways i got home about 1 and then this morning aroung 1030 we (mom, lillie, jen, my aunt) went to the zoo. we had fun. then i babysat tonight which was a pain in the ass. im supposed to go out wiht laura now but she went out with some other people...SAD!!! i was ditched, oh well! anyways im going to go and do something else.............ADIOS

      oh yes i almost forgot...i got a letter from amanda yesterday!!! omg i am SO happy to hear from her, it totally made my day. i really wish that i was on seminar with her.&nbsp; after reading her letter i went and looked up pictures of their trip so far and i saw all my camp friends and it just made me so "homesick" for camp. i know im not going to get a chance to go to israel anytime soon, if ever at all and it absolutely sucks. on the bright side im going to go and visit her over thanksgiving most likely and that makes me feel a little better.
