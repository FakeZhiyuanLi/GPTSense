      Now, before I go off on one, about the other rubbish stuff in my life, I want to point out that I'm not a manic depressive, or anything. Normally I'm quite perky and a typical teenager, but it's just recently stuff has been getting me down. Like all the bad shit happens at the same time. Well, all things pass. So this'll just be my venting place for whenever it gets too tough. There are some really great things in my life, and I need to remember that. There's my boyfriend, the twat, who is soooo sweet sometimes, and a complete dick in others. I love him, but he don't half annoy me at times. And I have lots of great friends! Most of them incredibly inconsiderate and insensitive (they tend to forget that I am, in fact, a young woman) but they're good people. And I'm fit, and slim, and although I'm not very pretty, I'm mostly happy with how I look. I'm intelligent and funny, and my teachers might not appreciate me, but I'm good in school.   So life isn't as bad as it seems, really.

      So, I'd better explain Rotten Thing number One. This isn't technically my problem, but I'm in on the secret, and I'm having to help Kaz through it. Oh. Then I guess it *is* my problem.   As everyone in the entire world knows, England are out of Euro 2004. The night we lost it all, Kaz's Dad was at the pub. Drunk. So, he called Kaz's mam to ask her to come pick him up. She took Mark, (Kaz's little brother) and set off to the pub. Well, after a bit of nastiness from her husband's tipsy mates, she bundled him into the car, and drove home.   There was a fight in the car, and Mark came home and ran straight into his bedroom in tears, while the adults fought it out in the living room. Kaz was asleep when they got back, but was awake in seconds from the shouting. Too frightened to leave her room, she sat on her bed and watched the locked living room door and strained to hear the conversation within. She didn't have to wait long. Her father was drunk enough to not really know what he was doing, and her mum was already ill. As Kaz's mother walked out of the living room mumbling 'I'm not up to a fight' he smashed one of his nested glass topped tables, and leapt out into the hall after her. There followed yet another argument. When Kaz's Dad started pointing at her mum, screaming at her, she knocked his hand away. He pushed her backwards and she fell, hitting her head on the computer desk.   How do you know what to do, at a point like that? Kaz just sat there crying, terrified. Mark was in his room, pretending it wasn't happening.   It's been two days since. He hasn't apologised. They might be splitting up, and Kaz and Mark are scared. But they can't ask, can they? Because all adults don't want to be 'interrogated and condemned by an insolent child'*. Adults have forgotten what it's like to be a kid, and even if they do remember, they don't understand. Things aren't like what they used to be.   I held Kaz in my arms while she sobbed her heart out on my shoulder, the morning after. I didn't know what to do or say. So I listened, and didn't interrupt. She seems to be coping better now, but we've not seen each other so I don't know how the situation at home is. I've been trying my best to make her laugh though - silly emails and idiot dancing on the webcam. I just hope I'm helping.  *Lord Asriel, Northern Lights

      Wow! My first blog as, well, me. I hope no one gives away my identity. Not that anyone'll find this place anyway, let alone read it. It's just my little place in the web to let off steam. I called it dust catcher, because my favourite books, 'His Dark Materials' are about Dust. Y'see, Dust comes to humans, and children only 'catch' it when they reach a certain age.. the age I'm coming to. Seemed appropriate, I guess.   And the tag line? Ah. Well, that's because the heroine in the book was fated, to end fate, as it were. But she had to do it, without realising it. She had to do it but be free to make mistakes, while all around her prayed that she did not, yet were unable to help her. Good stuff. Sometimes I feel like that, tied to one fate, and unable to change it so I thought it was also appropriate.   I'll get about to telling you about the world of sorrow I'm seemingly trapped in soon enough.   *grin*
