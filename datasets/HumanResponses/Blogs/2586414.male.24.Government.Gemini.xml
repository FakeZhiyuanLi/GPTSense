      So it has been a week since I have last made an entry into my blog- I am getting slack!  A fair bit has happened in the past week. Earlier in the week we had a bit of a mini heatwave- lasted half a day- it got up to 40.6 degrees here in the day time, but as always- the cold change came through just before I left work- so it dropped down to about 20 by the time I got out of the office. Very convenient and very nice. Since then you would not know it is summer here- and I am loving it- temps in the low 20’s and quite cloudy as well, roll on winter!  Earlier in the week I had been thinking about the job I had applied for in the other agency- I started to think that I did not want it that much. In reality, the only reason I had applied for it was because I wanted to work in the city- due to my moving to the other side of the city in a few weeks. I decided that I did not want the position, and a few days later- I got a letter telling me I did not get it. Just as well- I was starting to think about the drop in salary as well had I taken the position- I am due for a payrise where I am now in a couple of weeks now anyway so I did not really want to go backwards a few thousand per annum….  So I stay working where I am, and I am prepared (I think!) for the 90+ min one way commute to and from work… At least I will have LOTS of time to myself where I can read the paper- yay.  Yesterday we went out to the area where I am thinking of moving to- and checked out a few places. We ended up crossing quite a few places off our list, however there were a couple of nicer ones as well. It is good to know what you can get for your money before we start to get serious about moving to a new part of the city. The good things about that area are that it is drier, sunnier, warmer (in the day time!) and is closer to Melbourne city than where I am now…  I made up a mp3 cd for my mp3/cd walkman… I managed to fit 101 songs on it- however there was room for a few more- but I did not have any other songs downloaded. Now it will be a while before I manage to get another cd together- to download and find another 100+ songs will not be an easy task!   This weekend is Australia Day long weekend. I usually go to the city on Australia day night for the fireworks- however I do not think I will manage to get there this year. Last year they were cancelled due to the fireworks, but this year I just cannot be bothered- I just live too far away from the city to go in and celebrate- which is a shame because the Australia day fireworks are the best ones the city puts on- all without the dramas of public transport to get home (there are much smaller crowds for the Australia day celebrations)  Tomorrow, Australia day- I think I will just sleep in and do nothing much at all- how very Australian of me! If it is warm enough I may go to the beach, but I doubt it will be warm enough for a swim. We have been lucky to escape a prolonged heatwave so far this summer. Also the long range forecast is for a colder summer and autumn than average- so its all good!  I have started eating lots of salad for dinner lately. In my ‘special’ salad- I have iceburg lettuce, grated carrot, steamed peas, sultanas and grated tasty cheese. Yum yum yum. I also NEVER have dressing on my salads either- I do not know why people want to ruin their nice fresh salads with oil and vinegar for. Oh well….  I have been also eating lots of things with whipped cream as well- pancakes, fruit, chocolate cake…… I really should stop hey… lets just say I am building up my fat reserves for the winter!!!

      Now that I have recovered from my sickness, I’ve decided I am not going to bother updating this log everyday- just too much effort and I frankly could not be bothered. Yay for not giving a shit.  Today we had a barbeque- with a few people coming over. It was a very nice day for it- temps in the low 20’s, clear skies and lots and lots of sunlight.. wonderful  I did not drink any alcohol, for some reason I have totally gone off it and don’t want to have any at all. The same thing with sugary foods and drinks- I think they taste awful. I have started to eat lots of salads. My favourite salad is one of iceburg lettuce, grated carrot, grated tasty cheese, sultanas and boiled green peas- all with no topping- just raw- yum yum yum  Tomorrow it is back to work. Bugger. I do not really feel like going back to work just yet. Then again I did not want to have this weekend just now either- with my being away from work (sick) until Thursday I was just starting to get back into it again when I had to take this weekend off. Oh well.   I have just been trying to do up a table on excel. It is a useless program- I could only make about 250 columns- I wanted about 400- so I will have to start from the beginning again. Shit.   I have recorded a few shows that I have to watch later on. Most importantly is my new Zealand news week, from TV3 in new Zealand. I just love that show and have to watch it. It is interesting to see how NZ is so similar yet so different to Australia. At times I wish Australia was invaded by NZ so we could get rid of our government. However, I would like to retain our annual 4 weeks of leave, as compared to their 3 weeks of holidays.  Well- nothing new has really happened…better leave it here huh  Catchyas

      still home from work... i have been given a med cert that covers me until wednesday- but i have a feeling that i will be away from work then as well. i am not getting that much better- at the same time i am not getting any worse! i am still sweating huge amounts of water at night- its like i have never seen before- and it is very uncomfortable. i am getting my appetite back though. i have a craving for grapes and nectarines and apples and orange juice..... yum yum.. although i am only still eating very small amounts...  in a sense i do kind of want to be at work at the moment- if only to make further plans for a transfer from my current site should i be unsuccessful in getting that job i went for in the other government department....  hmm.. i really have been doing very little and thinking about even less- and you thought this blog could not get any more boring? heheh  catchyas

      spent most of the day in bed- i find i am sweating an enormous amount- literally covered in water- my hair is like i just got out of a shower, and the sheets- just totally uncomfortable. that and i still have a sore throat! i went to the doctors (at last!) and was told in an instant that i have tonsillitis. i should have gotten it treated much earlier huh- but this is me- not dead yet so i must be going strong...  i got some medicine- but i feel i may be allergic to it- it did not stay in my stomach for very long at all and tasted awful. i slept a lot today....   one of those weird things happened in the dr's surgery as well today. you know when you get the same train every day- you get to know (visually) the other people who get the same train with you? well- someone who is always at the train station when i am was at the surgery as well. i did not introduce myself- what was i going to say? but thought it unusual for us to meet here as well- of all places to meet on a sunday afternoon...  the worst thing about being sick is- i am missing out on this fantastic summer weather. there have been no heatwaves for a couple of weeks now- and none forecast for a while either. and the long term (3 month) forecast is for cooler than average weather... woo hoo!

      spent some of the day on the internet looking for some more nice places to move to on the other side of the city. i am writing down the addresses and dates down now (as well as prices) as i plan to bargain down the price of some of the houses if i see they have been vacant for a while- and it seems like some of them have.   the part of the city i want to move to is undergoing a transformation into a nicer area- some of it quite very nice and real value for money.   apart from that- spent the day very ill.. watched countdown at night again. they had an episode from 1981- those rockstars looked totally drugged out... then they had one from 1986- i am more familiar with those songs and really enjoyed watching it.   i was unable to eat anything all day- due to feeling unwell. i tried to eat a piece of bread- but it did not stay down long. yuck. i like being healthy a lot better than feeling like this!

      I spent the day at home today. Bloody sore throat. I was up through the night as well, shivering due to fever etc. Not very nice stuff. I am getting over it now though. (Either that or the Herron paracetamols are working really really well.)  I spent a rather quiet day indoors- watching television and videos of shows I had recorded through the week, like Mad TV etc.

      The morning was quite cool and windy, like a warm winters day. I was going to wear my winter long coat (trench coat) for outside, but decided against it. I wish I had taken it now- it was really really cold.   I was at work for a couple of hours, but then again my throat got too sore, so I went home rather early. I think I have passed on my sickness to someone else as well. Another person at work who sits near me went home earlier today, complaining of the same symptoms as myself. I’m contagious!  When I got home, I made some dinner and slept for about four hours. I am not sure if it is because I am really sick, or if I am just exhausted from lack of sleep. I don’t think I am sleep deprived, but then who sleeps for four hours in the afternoon?   When I wake up- I see on the news that it had been SNOWING up in the hills today. Only in Victoria (perhaps Tasmania too…)- snow in the middle of summer, while the rest of the country burns up in heat! Again, I would much rather be snuggled up in coats and pants and under blankets rather than sweating it out in a heatwave. That is why I left Queensland after all, the weather suits me better here.  I spent some of the afternoon looking through the internet for rentals on the other side of town. I applied for some leave so I can go look at some houses through the week as well next month. Some of them look very nice, and very cheap as well. One has to wonder why it is so cheap out there. Oh well, who cares, as long as it is more money in my pocket! I have also applied for a transfer to another office in that area, incase my application for a job I have gone for is unsuccessful.  Actually, regarding job applications- I received two letters from a government department about a job I applied for quite some time ago. The letters basically said that the jobs were no longer available etc etc. No big drama… as I had forgotten all about them. Except, I thought the letters were from ANOTHER agency which I had been in for an interview for a few weeks ago. I called them to ask about my name being kept on a backup list- in the event the jobs were to become vacant again, I asked if I would automatically be shortlisted without having to apply again. Of course, I rang the wrong department/agency, however I did not let them know that. They asked for me to fax the letter that I had gotten, and now I have to make up some story so stop me looking like a total idiot. In the end- the job I went for an interview for still has not been decided- so there is still hope. Then again, I really do not want to remain in the same agency for much longer- it is time for a change.. something new, something more challenging…   Nothing much more happened today. A sick boy does not get up to much in Melbourne…….

      I still have a sore throat, it is quite annoying. I had a sore throat a couple of weeks ago and I thought that I would not get sick again for quite some time. Oh well… I went to work in my new pinstripe trousers by Hugo Boss that I bought for $11 at Savers. Bargain. There is a lot to be said for wearing higher quality clothing… Apart from looking a lot nicer, it feels a lot nicer as well. The only downside is the cost of the dry cleaning to launder them every week. Oh well, that’s the price I must pay…  Quite a strong cold front came through today. The temperature dropped from about 24 down to 13 degrees in about 5 minutes. I went outside just before the front passed, and stayed out until the rain started. The sensation of the warm air mixing in with the cold air is very unusual. I could feel the different air masses swirling around, before it just got really cold. Silly me did not bother to take a jacket to work- it was really cold and windy for the rest of the day. Meanwhile only 1000km away it was apparently close to 50 degrees today. Such is the weather in Melbourne- it could be absolutely freezing on one side of the city, and scorching hot on the other- literally.   Through the day my throat got more and more sore- so I went and bought some Nurofen (I was not aware at the time that Herron Blue was exactly the same stuff- I would have bought it had I known). Anyway I took two of them while I was at work, and noticed I was feeling light headed. It felt really bizarre- my hands were tingling and my eyes had trouble focussing. However, despite all this, my throat was still sore. Not happy.   When I came home, I noticed the umbrella on my outdoor setting had broken in the high winds. It had lasted through all the winter gales, and broke in this summer storm. Oh well, I guess it is one less thing to take with me when I move house in a couple of months. While others in Australia were baking in heatwave conditions, I was rugged up in a jumper, trakkie pants, socks and a blanket while watching television. I really like winter, but I am not so sure I am a big fan of it in the middle of January. Than again, it is better than it being 40 degrees….  Nothing much more for today……..

      The day starts with me waking up at about 10:20 in the morning. This is extremely late for me, but reasonable as I was awake until about 2 earlier in the morning. I was not doing anything exciting, except play Sim City 3000. Me, in Melbourne, on a Friday night- indoors playing a computer game- that is rather sad, even by my standards. I do have an excuse (kind of) though. At 23 years of age- I still have not bothered to get my drivers licence. And I cannot be bothered riding on a train or bus for over an hour from the city to get home either. I only ever go out when one of the major city clubs come out to the suburbs to play in one of the local night spots. I recently went out to a night put on by local clubs,  urlLink Bass   urlLink Station , and the following week, Hard Kandy. Both are more hardcore dance clubs- with faster music and yeah… the kind of music you jump up and down to (and for many people- take your drugs to) I must admit- I have never done drugs of any sort out in public, but still act as if I am on them- dancing like a crazed lunatic. I only go out to clubs in Melbourne very rarely- like once or twice a year. I am not sure if this is because I have grown out of them, or because I generally cannot be bothered leaving my house to go out.   When I was living in  urlLink Brisbane , I used to go out every single weekend to this nightclub called the Beat in Fortitude Valley. I used to think it had the best music, and yeah, I would be dancing up on the tables all night long making an idiot of myself- all without alcohol or drugs. I do drink, occasionally at parties and gatherings etc, but very very rarely out at clubs- water is the drink of choice for me there. When I tried to drink alcohol at the dance club- I found I could not dance very well at all, so I decided that I would stick to water…. That and the fact it is so much cheaper as well! I went out every weekend while living in Brisbane, right up until when I moved to Melbourne- and then all of a sudden I stopped going out to clubs all together. Perhaps one day I will get out there and party on again, but I really doubt it. For a start, I would have no idea as to what to wear to a night out in Melbourne. I hate dress codes- too casual, too formal, no black….. May as well just sit at home and download some music and dance away in the lounge room…. Fun fun fun.  Today is another fantastic  urlLink sunny  Melbourne day, again above 30 degrees. It is meant to be about 37 tomorrow, I am not really looking forward to that, however the warmer night tonight should be fun. It will feel like I am back in north Queensland again…. Perhaps.  Then it is back to work on Monday. I really do not feel like going back to work after so long off on long weekends and sick leave (I had a sore throat the other week, was out of action for a whole week just before the xmas break and all).   Today I decided to go to the garage and vacuum the spider webs from the corners and ceiling of the garage. I have sprayed them all before with surface spray and bug killer- but nothing works. In any case, the garage now looks a lot neater and there are a lot less spiders in it. There were quite a few more than I was expecting, and it looked as if it was just breeding season for the spiders, the majority of which were daddy long-legs spiders. I found quite a few egg sacs, as well as lots of baby spiders. Up the vacuum they went. I have ducted vacuum, so they will remain in the bag until it is time to remove them in about a years time.   There really is nothing more to write about today- it is just another lazy Saturday afternoon…. I don’t feel like doing anything at all, so I won’t. Fantastic.  Catchyas

      Nothing much to write about today…. Woke up cold for the first time this year- only took five days! It has been a while since the first thing I think of when I get up in the morning is “should I wear a jacket to work this morning”. … I end up with a runny nose- at first I thought it was just because it was cold (if you could call 14 degrees cold), but then realised through the day that I was catching a cold. My eyes were getting sore, like when one is tired, however no matter how much coffee I consumed, I was still feeling this tired sensation in my eyes. That and the runny nose kept going.   Work was good. The computer server was not working when I got in, which meant we could not even log on to our pc’s. This was the case until about 1pm. Everyone seemed to be bored out of their minds, however I used the time to plan a presentation I am to deliver in a couple of weeks time. I don’t know why people rely so much on computers now. There is so much that can be done with a pencil and paper. I did the entire outline and some of the detail of my presentation. All I need the PC for is for a slideshow presentation that I will do up later through the week.  When it came to lunch, I went and bought a couple of new work shirts from a nearby men’s clothing store. The sign out the front said 25% off everything in the store, so when I was at the counter, I asked for my 25% off. The guy behind the counter tried to tell me that there was no discount. I told him I got 20% off the very same items last week (and I did) when the sale was 20% off everything. He got all shitty and basically threw the shirts, and my credit card at me. Rudeness.  I do not really mind too much though, as I got my discount in the end.   After that I went to  urlLink Safeway  and bought some things, including a pack of pre-made fried rice and tomato sauce. Yummy. I took out all the bacon pieces after I re-heated it, and put lots of tomato sauce all over it. Only $2 for 500 grams of fried rice. Very cheap. Actually, it looked cheap as well. The carrot was GRATED, and it was mostly rice, but that’s mainly why I bought this brand (home brand)- because I just wanted some cooked rice with tomato sauce- the vegetables were just a bonus I suppose. I normally just take bread to work and made sandwiches for lunch everyday. Very cheap and very cost effective.  After lunch, I asked my supervisor about getting a transfer back to my old office. I had originally worked there a couple of years ago until I moved house to the other side of the city. I am moving back, though this time to another corner of the city. This will happen in a couple of months time. He seemed shocked, I don’t know why. I have already applied for another job right in the city. I went to a job interview for that position last month. I don’t expect to hear anything back until late January/early February. If I don’t get that job, then yeah, I will be looking to arrange a transfer as soon as possible. If not to my old site, than to any other office on that side of the city. Wish me luck!  I got my new suit (that I bought from that Savers store) dry-cleaned today. It looks really good and it is a perfect fit. I cannot wait to wear it out somewhere. I will most likely wear the trousers without the jacket to work. The jacket will most likely be worn with jeans or something. Apparently that is the ‘in’ look. We’ll see. My current job does not require me to wear a suit. Or even to wear trousers. Shorts are acceptable, as are cargoes and that- but I cannot go to work dressed like that. It feels too informal and I end up doing no work at all.   I think I am getting sick. That’s not very nice. Oh well, I am taking tomorrow off work anyway to recover, I do not want for this to get any worse. And in any case, they would not give us 20 sick days (or more accurately, 147 hours per year of sick leave) if they did not think we would actually use it!  Catchyas!

      Four days into the new year, and we have our first rainy day in Melbourne. True to form, the weather turned out to be nothing like forecast. It was meant to be 37, sunny before a late change. It was actually raining by 9am and it only got to 22 degrees through the day, and it rained for the majority of the time as well. Perfect weather for cleaning out the bathroom and getting rid of old hair product, containers, bags, and other things that I had been putting off throwing out- for no other reason than it was too troublesome to take them out to the bin only a couple of rooms away. Today was also a good day for eating lots of junk food and watching television. I did a lot of that.   For breakfast (after midday) I had chicken nuggets (from a world famous fast food chain) re-heated in the oven with some rice I made up, and lots of tomato sauce. Delicious. I rarely ‘cook’ anything for breakfast, but today I just felt like something different- and so it was. I bought the nuggets the previous night, when for some bizarre reason, I decided to go to the fast food place (let’s call it Mc Donald’s), to get a burger and chips. I hate Mc Donald’s. The meat was so dry and flavourless. There was too much mayo, and the bread was also rather dry. I do not know why I even went in there. Maybe I was hoping that things had changed? They hadn’t. I usually go to Red  urlLink Rooster  (which is right next to the Mc Donald’s.) I love eating their chicken roll, and I usually get a small thing of chips to go with it. I love putting tomato sauce all through the chicken roll, and all over the chips as well- after putting on extra salt. Maybe that’s why I am getting a little bit of fat on my gut… I really should start exercising…. Or perhaps I should get rid of the stash of sweets I have in my desk at work….   Sometimes I try to go healthy and eat nuts and sultanas and that at work, but it never lasts long. I should start eating breakfast again. I usually just go to work after just having a coffee (or tea), and nothing else until lunch time…. Poor me though can’t be bothered getting up early to eat though. Such a typical Aussie. However, I read in the paper that in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, it is getting quite popular now to go to a breakfast café for a coffee and full morning meal, before getting a tram into the city. I don’t know about that though. I am such a tightarse. I will not go out for breakfast and buy something I could have made myself. I very rarely go out to restaurants, and never of my own volition. I do admit that Melbourne has some excellent restaurants; I would not go to them- not now that I am living here. As a tourist (I only came here twice, both times for less than a week before moving here to live), I used to love eating out, especially on Southbank, but yeah… not now. I am going to contradict myself now- bigtime. I do sometimes come into the city to have lunch with an old workmate of mine at a restaurant- we always go to Hardware Lane in the city- really really good line of restaurants there, and all reasonably priced- and no I would not be able to make any of that food at home. If you ever come to Melbourne, definitely try it out and see where the locals eat through the week.   I saw a few interesting news stories through the day. That Steve Irwin thing- putting his baby in the croc enclosure- really- was a silly thing to do in public. I have always been embarrassed to be in the same country as him. He really does not represent Australia in any way, shape or form, and it is saddening to think that the world now thinks we act like him. I think the media should just ignore him here, leave him for the overseas markets. What we don’t know here won’t shock/embarrass us.   In another story, apparently the inner city was shut down this morning because of a shooting in a nightclub ( urlLink Bubble ) on King Street. For starters, I would never go to King Street at night. Through the media over the years the police have given the impression that there are stabbings there at least once a week, and it is generally well known that it is a very violent area. Then again, I have gone to Hard Kandy at Billboards, and that is in what is supposed to be one of the drug hotspots in the city, and I had no trouble there when I went. Actually, speaking of going out clubbing- I realised yesterday why I do not go out anymore. It is because of the threat of terrorism… I know it sounds stupid as it is, but after those big attacks on the USA in 2001, the government here was putting all sorts of warnings out, and the media was getting the most it could out of it as well. I was under the impression that terrorists were going to go for large gatherings of people, in a nightclub setting, and to an extent I was right- with what happened in Bali in 2002. People say that you have to not let the terrorists win by not doing the things that you want to do. But then again, by not going out every weekend, I have discovered I can still enjoy my Saturday nights even without going out all the time. All the same though, I do miss going out- I think after I move in closer to the city, I will once again be out and about.   I may have to choose different clubs though. Last time I went out to a local club, I felt as though I was one of the oldest people there. Everyone else seemed to be either underage or just on 18. I felt a little uncomfortable, but then I just started dancing and got over it. Who cares what others think of me being older, I was there to dance the night away.. woo hoo!  Last night, I had the tv on while making the bed… I was surprised to see on ‘Countdown’, a show not unlike top of the pops, but it was Australian and this episode was a repeat of one from 1986. All my faves were on, and after that, they had one from 1985. yayayayay. Those of you with children may be familiar with a children’s group called the wiggles… Well before they were the wiggles, they were called the cockroaches- and they had a song on the show as well, right back in the 80’s. You know what, it was not that bad either!!! It was weird seeing them so young- they are all over the media here- so it was like one of those ‘before they were famous’ moments…. I also saw some Madonna songs that apparently were hits but I had never heard of before (dress you up, gambler…), and even an old SAMANTHA FOX CLIP!!! Video clips in the 80’s were so tacky, but some were also very cool. Because it was an Australian show, they had a lot of Australian video clips, many of them showing shots of the city of Melbourne in the 80’s. I love watching videos and seeing pictures of Melbourne before I came here. It is an ever changing city. New high rises going up all the time. Entire city blocks being rebuilt and changed, mostly for the better. Anyway I recorded the entire nights viewing on Rage, because I think they were playing back to back repeats from the 80’s of Countdown on it.  Those of you who know me may know that I am a little obsessed with the  urlLink weather . For the last couple of years, I have kept track of the temperature every single day. I thought I would use this opportunity to share this info with you- some Melbourne weather trivia… (well according to my trusty digital thermometer anyway!) If you are planning on coming to Melbourne- you might just find this information handy. Remember it is generally wet through Spring (Sep 01-Nov 30) and dry through mid-late summer through to late autumn. Winter is a mix between dry dry dry sunny days and foggy wet ones.   Hottest day- 40.6 - Janurary 25, 17 December 2003 Coldest day- (-0.7) August 20, 2003  Annual Max- 20.3837 Annual Min- 10.4823  Averages-                 (and extremes) Jan- 28.13-14.86      (40.6-9.3) Feb- 26.60-15.86     (36.3-10.9) Mar- 23.50- 13.91    (34.3-9.1) Apr- 20.01-10.23     (27.8- 5.5) May- 17.17- 8.12     (23.2-2.3) Jun- 14.71- 8.70      (19.5-1.1) Jul- 14.00- 6.30       (18.5-1.5) Aug- 14.11- 6.71     (18.7-(-0.7)) Sep- 16.35- 7.36     (21.9-0.5) Oct- 17.22- 8.00      (27.9- 4.3) Nov- 24.37- 11.45   (39.1-6.8) Dec- 28.84-14.67    (40.6- 9.7)

      The day starts with me waking up at about 10:20 in the morning. This is extremely late for me, but reasonable as I was awake until about 2 earlier in the morning. I was not doing anything exciting, except play Sim City 3000. Me, in Melbourne, on a Friday night- indoors playing a computer game- that is rather sad, even by my standards. I do have an excuse (kind of) though. At 23 years of age- I still have not bothered to get my drivers licence. And I cannot be bothered riding on a train or bus for over an hour from the city to get home either. I only ever go out when one of the major city clubs come out to the suburbs to play in one of the local night spots. I recently went out to a night put on by local clubs,  urlLink Bass   urlLink Station , and the following week, Hard Kandy. Both are more hardcore dance clubs- with faster music and yeah… the kind of music you jump up and down to (and for many people- take your drugs to) I must admit- I have never done drugs of any sort out in public, but still act as if I am on them- dancing like a crazed lunatic. I only go out to clubs in Melbourne very rarely- like once or twice a year. I am not sure if this is because I have grown out of them, or because I generally cannot be bothered leaving my house to go out.   When I was living in  urlLink Brisbane , I used to go out every single weekend to this nightclub called the Beat in Fortitude Valley. I used to think it had the best music, and yeah, I would be dancing up on the tables all night long making an idiot of myself- all without alcohol or drugs. I do drink, occasionally at parties and gatherings etc, but very very rarely out at clubs- water is the drink of choice for me there. When I tried to drink alcohol at the dance club- I found I could not dance very well at all, so I decided that I would stick to water…. That and the fact it is so much cheaper as well! I went out every weekend while living in Brisbane, right up until when I moved to Melbourne- and then all of a sudden I stopped going out to clubs all together. Perhaps one day I will get out there and party on again, but I really doubt it. For a start, I would have no idea as to what to wear to a night out in Melbourne. I hate dress codes- too casual, too formal, no black….. May as well just sit at home and download some music and dance away in the lounge room…. Fun fun fun.  Today is another fantastic  urlLink sunny  Melbourne day, again above 30 degrees. It is meant to be about 37 tomorrow, I am not really looking forward to that, however the warmer night tonight should be fun. It will feel like I am back in north Queensland again…. Perhaps.  Then it is back to work on Monday. I really do not feel like going back to work after so long off on long weekends and sick leave (I had a sore throat the other week, was out of action for a whole week just before the xmas break and all).   Today I decided to go to the garage and vacuum the spider webs from the corners and ceiling of the garage. I have sprayed them all before with surface spray and bug killer- but nothing works. In any case, the garage now looks a lot neater and there are a lot less spiders in it. There were quite a few more than I was expecting, and it looked as if it was just breeding season for the spiders, the majority of which were daddy long-legs spiders. I found quite a few egg sacs, as well as lots of baby spiders. Up the vacuum they went. I have ducted vacuum, so they will remain in the bag until it is time to remove them in about a years time.   There really is nothing more to write about today- it is just another lazy Saturday afternoon…. I don’t feel like doing anything at all, so I won’t. Fantastic.  Catchyas

      So… you have made it this far? I started out thinking this was going to be some sort of collection of ideas and thoughts, but I think this may be somewhat more of a journal in its format and content. I apologise if you are reading this thinking this was going to be something a little bit different. Actually I do not know what is expected of web logs- I have never actually gone into one before and read it. I have heard and read a lot about them though. The technology section of the age newspaper has a segment every Tuesday dedicated to top ‘blogs’ on the net. Some of them sound really interesting, but me, I cannot be bothered to actually go into them and have a look for myself… and here I am writing my own- how weird….  Today was yet another fantastic beautiful day. Not a cloud in the sky all day, just like yesterday. Also, it was a fabulous 31 degrees- all without the humidity of some northern cities- you just gotta love a  urlLink Melbourne  summer. (Or Melbourne anytime for that matter.) I spent a portion of the day in a shopping centre. I somehow wish now that I didn’t. I went to  urlLink Coles  and spent quite a lot more money than I was expecting. Then again, I got quite a few items that I only get every once in a while- like bug spray, fragrance things for the house, and other things like that. I came across an air wick thing that looks like a snow-globe, only there is no ‘snow’ in it, but instead a plastic fish that floats in the perfume. It looks really funky and smells nice too. I got another one as well that is also designed to be placed out in the open. I like that a lot more. It is more convenient to have it designed in a fashion so that one is encouraged to display rather than hide it.  Before I went to  urlLink Coles , I also spent a lot more money than I expected at Savers. This place is amazing- it is basically a second hand store, except it is the size of a supermarket. There is a lot of old tat in there, however there is a lot of really good stuff in there as well- either seconds, samples or just really good 2nd hand clothing. I got quite a few t-shirts, shorts, trousers for work, and I even got a suit. Better yet- the suit fitted perfectly- however I will have to dry clean it before wearing it out anywhere! I also got a couple of pairs of jeans as well. After I discovered this place at one of its other locations in Sydney Road, Brunswick, I promised myself I would never shop at normal shops again- the value for money at Savers is just too good. However, there are times where I just have to shop retail- for shoes, socks, underwear… I would never purchase those second hand.   I happened to see the front page of the local tabloid today, the  urlLink Sun , and the picture was a bit disturbing. It showed one of the CBD train stations, Flinders Street, absolutely full of people, at 1:30am on New Year’s morning- just after the LAST  urlLink TRAIN  for the night had left! I am glad now that I did not go to the city for new years like I was wanting to earlier that evening. It was always going to happen though, this government (Victorian Labor State  urlLink Government ) can’t seem to get anything right- in my opinion anyway. If you are going to have 400,000+ people in the city for midnight fireworks, you would expect that you would have trains running all night long. (In Melbourne, buses generally do not operate from the city to the suburbs. The  urlLink buses  that do run operate between suburbs, and even then, do not operate on weekends or public holidays- very inconvenient.) Apparently there were very few taxis about as well. And the trams were absolutely full of people and there were people left behind when the last one left sometime around 1:30am as well. Melbourne is hosting the  urlLink Commonwealth   urlLink Games  in  urlLink 2006 - there should be a lot more people in the city for that event- spread over a period of a few weeks. I think I can see major transportation problems for the games when the time comes to host them. I think I should plan some leave for the duration of the games- what do you think?  Earlier today I had the urge to go to the beach (I live across the road from it), but did not get around to going there. I think I will wait until Sunday for that, it is forecast to get up to 37 degrees. Swimming in a Melbourne heatwave is very unusual. I remember the sensation of being waist deep in the water, and my toes and feel feeling extremely cold, and then my upper body feeling really hot and prickly. It is a really refreshing feeling to finally go all the way into the water, submersing your entire body, but it takes me a lot to get that far- it is just so cold!  For dinner tonight I had chicken cooked in teriyaki sauce, and some rice that I cooked in chicken stock. Very delicious. I cooked the chicken slowly for about 2 hours. By the time it was done- it was basically falling apart because it was so nice and juicy and tender. Yummy. I think afterwards I will eat a gaytime ice-lolly. If you have not had one before- you should try them! I am actually in the mood for lots of sweets. I really should not get started into them though, I am starting to out grow some of my trousers- and that is not a good thing!  (It means more shopping and more going crazy- at Savers!)  The sun is setting now at about 8:47pm, from here on in, the sun will be setting at ever earlier times. Before I know it, daylight savings will be over, and the sun will be setting closer to 5pm and rising at 7:37….. I am not sure if I like winter more or summer. I definitely like the nice sunny days like today, but then again I also like it a lot when it rains all day and very windy. I also love it when it is frosty and clear in the morning time. The air feels so good to breathe in when it is that cold… Oh- want to hear something totally crazy? Yesterday afternoon, I decided to go outside because it was really warm and sunny. I felt that the pavers outside in the courtyard were also really warm- so I lay down on them and soaked up the heat radiating from them. It was one of the nicest feelings ever, just soaking up the heat from the pavers that had been in the sun all day. (By this time, they were in the shade, so I was not getting any sunburn!) Sounds like a weird thing to do huh, but that’s me, weird.   Tonight I was watching some  urlLink music   urlLink max , the retro music station on Foxtel. I came across some 80’s songs that I will have to download in the future perhaps. Some Janet Jackson (Nasty Boys, Rhythm Nation…), Prodigy (all their early rave stuff), and early Madonna… I think as I am getting older, my taste in music is getting more conservative. I used to be into really dark drum and bass, and hardcore techno… Now I am moving more towards UK garage, house, and general pop…. I am even a fan of Delta Goodrem! Noooooooooooooooo!  What else is there to write about today? I came across the tv show Doggy Fizzle Televizzle. It’s apparently a sketch comedy featuring Snoop… It is quite amusing, but to be honest, I have to admit to liking Mad TV more.  Anyway I think this will do it for today’s entry. Still reading? Grouse! ;p  Catch yas…

       urlLink grouse!  (i did not know what else to write as my first ever word in my first ever web log- so i chose that... how very melburnian of me!) i am not sure if i actually have anything to write about now that i have opened this account- however i have been planning on setting up my very own weblog now for a few months... there have been days where i have had thoughts that i just wanted to share with the world (or anyone who would care to listen!)- so yeah- now i have that 'place'...   a brief bio on me i suppose would be appropriate now hey? it should shed a little background on myself, and also hopefully put some of my future entries into context...   i am a 23 year old male, living in  urlLink melbourne ,  urlLink victoria , australia.    i moved from  urlLink brisbane , queensland, about 3 years ago seeking better employment prospects and higher wages than what could be offered in brisbane... i remember looking in the job ads and seeing ALL senior positions were based in melbourne and sydney... i chose to live in melbourne because it is a lot cleaner and greener- and when i went to sydney for a week in winter- i found it to be dirty and not too pleseant (mind you- i went to melbourne for a week immediately after visiting sydney- also in winter- and thought it was great- melbourne that is!) i was in brisbane for 2 years studying a bachelor of arts, and then a bachelor of business... which are still as yet- unfinished.   before moving to brisbane- i grew up and lived in a very small town called  urlLink bowen , in north queensland.   i very much enjoyed my time there- however do not get the chance to visit very often... mainly because i hate taking holidays.. i am not sure whether it is my obsession of hoarding leave credits so i get a huge pay out when i eventually leave my current job- or whether i just hate leaving  urlLink melbourne - it is just such a fantastic place!   anyway yeah thats a brief bio... oh- you want to know where i work now... well i work in the australian public service- or for the  urlLink federal  government... at this stage i wont scare you with the name of the agency i work for- at most parties when i tell new people where i work- it generally kills the conversation. i suppose the good thing about working there is that it pays rather well and the work is relatively easy.. but yeah- it is not one of australia's most favourite government service delivery agencies!   shall i start off with a journal entry? ok- well.. new years eve/new years day 2004- i spent midnight at the beach, looking at the fireworks going off all across port phillip bay- it was really nice, but not as good as last year. i think i will just watch it on the tv next year.... it was a really warm night- about 18 degrees - and people were swimming in the ocean (it was really calm and the moonlight made it just that little bit more exciting and enticing)- but not me- i find the water cold enough on a hot summers day, forget about going in there at night! i stayed up until about 2 watching some  urlLink foxtel  (cable) then went to bed... today i got up, watched more tv.... and got onto kazaa and downloaded some songs from the 80's... (go the 80's revival!)- stuff from technotronic, snap!, bananarama, b52's, and also some more modern things from planet perfecto, dj spinnin, darude.... things to put on my mp3/cd player for the train to work....   well- i am not sure how much longer i should go for- so i will just end this one here for today- welcome to my life- i hope you enjoy reading all about me- but i should warn you- i am a bit of a boring person! heheh   catchyas

      25.02.04  Waiting for a virgin….  I am sitting here, waiting in a queue to verify my booking on a couple of flights I have just booked over the internet. $29 to mostly anywhere in Australia- fantastic I thought as I watched the news. I should have known better- just after I placed my order via credit card- the page stalled. It remained stalled for the next 45 minutes. I eventually gave up and pressed refresh- at which time I received a validation code. I also received a message that my booking had been submitted and confirmed, and that I was not to make another booking for the same flight (otherwise I would be charged twice). It said I also had to call them because my booking experienced an unknown error. I would call stalling for 45 minutes an unknown error….  Anyway, in other news- I got confirmation today of my new address and phone number details out west… I got a place in one of the new estates out there- really really nice.  I have just sent an email to everyone letting them know the details- so yeah- its all happening! We are going to move through the week- as I have the entire week off work- so it works out really well that we found something just now.  It is slowly getting into winter here- days getting noticeably shorter- however I will really feel it when daylight savings ends at the end of March. Oh well.. there are a couple of warm days remaining in the outlook period- so all is not lost!  Meanwhile I cant get over being able to get both tickets at $29!!! What a bargain!!  This morning I got one of those brand new Melbourne trains. They are so lush- and so so so quiet! Also- there are no doors between carriages- it is one long carriage- which makes it feel a lot nicer. It also reduces the ability for people to stand between the carriages for a cigarette etc (and train surfing) Very thoughtful.  I am sick of being on hold to virgin blue- I will call them tomorrow or Friday- and hopefully I will not have to wait for hours for a response!  See ya

      16.02.04  Just a comment for today- about those weird people who choose to wear the most inappropriate clothing... you have seen them out on the streets- out jogging, or just out there trying to get attention from anyone who cares to waste a few seconds of their life to look at them…. Have you ever been on your way to work on a morning when it is below freezing- only to see those people ‘jogging’ wearing nothing more than a loose pair of shorts and singlet (for the guys) or a skimpy bikini top for the chicks? What about those ones who wear full on tracksuits when it is over 40 degrees… again out excercising…. I don’t know how or why they do it- but I think they just look stupid- stupid for wearing such inappropriate clothing.   No- I have not seen someone doing this today- but I was thinking about it. Why do these people wear these clothes at these times…? Dressing for 40 when it is  -3, or for 5 when it is 37……? Weird.  Now that I am over that- I had a very  nice walk along the beach on my way home from work today. The tide was out and it was absolutely clear and sunny- as well as cool. There were a couple of kite surfers out and about. I want to give it a go one day, but I would imagine it would take a lot of strength to be able to control a kite surfer thingo- the wind and the waves… I wonder if there is a children’s version or something…..  Mondays are generally uneventful. Today I got another reason as to why I am correct when I say Sydney is a shit hole… well, a couple of reasons… Did you see on the news those riots in Sydney…? Who would want to live there…. And their public transport just not working at all…. Yuck yuck yuck… And the other reason why Melbourne is better than Sydney… I read in www.melbourne.vic.gov.au (and of course because it was in there it just has to be true)… Melbourne was founded based on opportunity- for free settlers- Sydney was slave central… convicts and criminals running rampant (nothing has changed if those riots are anything to go by)…. Also, Melbourne is the best city in the world (ok- along with Vancouver and Vienna)…. I wonder if anyone had thought of setting up like a travel package- see the world’s most liveable cities in 3 weeks…… Woo hoo…. I have always wanted to go to Canada anyway…   Oh- that’s what offends me now- Australians flying the American flag in their backyards- why do they do it? It is not as if we are part of their country and it is not as if we owe them anything is it? Anyway….. enough from me for tonight  Catchyas

      15/02/04  I am not sure if I have mentioned this so far, but I have now finally paid off my HECS debt. That means now I can finally get more decent money from my pay packet now I am paying 6% less tax. On top of that, I got another pay rise the same fortnight, so it is a double gain for me. Excellent.  Have you ever heard people complaining about Melbourne weather? This week they would have had a good excuse to. Last Sunday it got to 43.7 here, and then on Wednesday, it rained basically all day and only got to 17 briefly after hovering around 14 for most of the day, and then yesterday again it got to 42.7. Last night was unbelievable- it rained a little and remained really hot and humid all night. Literally, it was over 90% humidity and only as cool as 23 degrees. Any thoughts I had of moving back to Queensland were erased with that hot and humid night. Today is equally uncomfortable- about 85% humid and 31 degrees. Everything is moist- the newspaper feels damp, toast becomes damp if left out too long, it’s so disgusting. Roll on winter!  I went to the beach yesterday and for the first time this summer, I managed to fully submerge myself in the water. I had almost forgotten how exhilarating and wonderful it feels to properly swim in that cold water. Wonderful. What was even better was that there was no wind at all- making for a very relaxing star fishing session.  Nothing much else has been happening to me lately- so I will end it here. How boring- but oh well….  Catchyas

      050204  Today summer decided to come back after spending the last few weeks away- and by away, I mean basically everywhere else in Australia except Melbourne. It has been like spring the last few weeks or so- rather cool and cloudy- no heatwaves at all. Today it got to 38.6….. The train home was very uncomfortable- no air conditioning and some of the windows would not open. The air coming through the windows was really hot anyway- so it really made no difference. When I came home- I decided to go straight to the beach. When I got there, it was really nice and absolutely calm and flat. I could see in the distance waves and the mirage of where the dry cold front was, but thought it would be a while before it got to my side of the bay. Anyway, I went into the water- absolutely clear and calm, although very cold. I was only in up to my knees when I felt very light headed- due to the water being so cold and the air being so hot. I think that is what is called ‘shock’. I waded around and eventually only go up to my navel when it happened- the cold wind came from the bay and the water got all choppy (well choppy for Melbourne anyway)- and by cool- I mean 34 degrees instead of 38. Nevertheless- it was still too cool to be in that water- so I got out and went home. I was only over there in the water for about ten minutes. I was very disappointed as I was hoping to be fully submerged today- for the first time this summer. The forecast for this Sunday is for 35 degrees again- so hopefully I will get a chance to go for another swim then.  Today I celebrated my third anniversary of when I commenced my job with the government. Yay. I didn’t really celebrate- however I was happy with the payrise that comes with it. My next salary increase comes in September. Yay. Even better, my hecs is now fully paid off- so I can get even more money from my pay packet- less tax!  I am expecting to move in about 4-6 weeks- it seems all so sudden, but then again I am also really looking forward to it also. We will see in a few weeks time what else is available out there and whether I am approved for another lease. I hate moving, but I have taken a week off work to do it so it should not be so rushed this time.  I have a sore throat. I think I might have tonsillitis (again). I think I will go to the doctor tomorrow to find out for sure. Wish me luck! (in that I don’t have it!)

      24/04/2004  Winter finally arrived yesterday, and it was fantastic. Gales, rain, and cold- just fantastic- a lot better than the heat of recent days. It seemed to have caught a lot of people by surprise- looking at the shivering people at the train station in the city. I say I love the cold weather now, but I am sure, just as always, that I will be well and truly over it by about August/September…..  The day before was a different story though, a taste of summer. It got to 33 degrees here- quite hot I think for this time of year- especially considering the average maximum for this time of year is about 20 or so. It was very windy as well, but also quite dusty. You could smell the dust and earth in the air- it was very uncomfortable. Also when I was walking home from the bus stop that night, dust kept getting into my eyes. I am not sure where it was all coming from- but my guess would be all the construction sites over this side of the city. The western suburbs seem to be exploding in terms of new development for residential, commercial and industrial areas at the moment. It is all good- and I think when I eventually get around to getting a house built- I will go for something in this area.  On Monday I took my first sickie of the year. I am quite proud of myself for being able to go so long through the year without taking a day off work due to being ill. I spent the day mainly planting bulbs all through the back yard. I got about 330 of them through mail order from the newspaper (the age)- all for $44. I thought that was quite a bargain! However, I did not really realize how many that was- so only got to plant about half of the bulbs I received from this offer. I will give the rest away to my partners parents who live nearby- after they showed an interest in them recently.  On the weekend I saw an ad in the paper regarding ADSL connection to this address. At the moment I am using a satellite connection. Apparently ADSL is now available to this area. I was quite annoyed when I read this, because I had only just gone back to satellite connection due to no other broadband being available in this area. When I called up to get ADSL connected- I was told that we could have it connected in about 4 weeks. Later on in the week though- they said that we were one of only five phone  numbers in the entire area that could NOT have ADSL connected at this time. How annoying. Anyway it looks as if I will be using satellite for a while longer yet.  Over the past several months I have been watching the progress of the eureka tower being built on the south side of the Yarra River in the city. It is now up to about 60 storeys… I had thought of purchasing an apartment in this building, but then was kind of put off it by the threat of certain objects flying into it. Everyone says that you cannot continue to live your life in fear, and that you should get out and do things like you normally would. I cannot seem to do so- from going out to nightclubs, to living in high rise apartment blocks. I suppose the one good thing to come from this is that I am saving a lot of money! Instead of going out every weekend, I am staying home watching television- so it is all good.  Anyway this is enough from me- time to go get some breakfast!

      well it has certainly been a while since I last updated this page. I have now moved out west and am absolutely loving it.  It is so much quieter than my old address- and the air seems so much cleaner as well, even though there is a major freeway less than a kilometer away from here.   The day I moved in- it was 37 degrees. That really is the kind of weather you want when you are moving house. (note the sarcasm) but it proved my point in that it really is a lot warmer over this side of the city than the south (during the day that is! during the night it can be a lot colder here than the other side of the city as well!)  One of the first things I noticed was that it was also a lot drier here as well. My face and hands really felt really dry and disgusting. I have gotten used to it now and do not notice it at all (unless it is just not so dry anymore!)   The travel to work is something I do not mind so much either- which is a bit of a surprise even to myself. 2 hours to work and 2 hours to get back. People at work have commented on how much happier I seem. I think it has something to do with the fact that I now have 2 hours in which to wake up in the morning and read my paper before I get into work. I love to read my paper in the morning- and if I miss out on that- well my day just does not seem complete. I know that sounds a bit corny, but it is me   On my way home- I am now reading through the other parts of the paper I normally would not touch, like the sports and business (normally I just read the news) so yeah I am becoming quite the melburnian!  I have considered getting a transfer to this side of town, but I am not so sure that this is something that I would want. I have sent in expressions of interest to two offices that are local to here, but now that I think about it- I am quite happy where I am right now.   One thing that has happened in the last couple of months is the end of daylight savings. I am a little sly when it comes to organizing my work roster when the clock changes over. At the end of daylight savings- i worked an hour earlier (and finished an hour earlier) for the week immediately after daylight savings. That means that today for the first time since, well, last time this happened- I worked until normal finishing time in a non daylight saving period. By the time I got my train to the city- it was already almost sunset. Because I missed my connecting train- I had to wait for the next one- which came about 15 mins after sunset. When I got into the train at flinders street station- you could still see, and it was not really that dark. By the time I got out of the city loop underground, it was absolutely black- I did not know I was out of the tunnel until I was seeing the shipyards pass me by… which meant I had totally not noticed that the train had gone to and passed north Melbourne station. It was the first time I had gone home in the dark to this address. It was an interesting experience, and I cannot say that I did not enjoy it. The only bad thing is that now I will be coming home in the dark until daylight savings commences again in November- unless I get a transfer closer to home of course!  Another thing that has happened as well is the changing of the seasons. The leaves are all starting to go yellow and brown and orange and red. It is really quite spectacular. Especially when you see a tree with ALL of the above colours on display. In a way it is sad as well- as it is a reminder that those long summer days have gone for another year.

      After 3 weeks of relaxation and enjoyment, today was the day I had to go back to work. The journey to work was not as bad as I thought it would be, however when I reached the city I saw a billboard that I rather not have seen. It was a poster advertising holidays in the Whitsundays…. This is where I was just a couple of weeks ago, and brought back memories of lazing about at the beach all day, getting incredibly sunburnt.   My train out of the city and into work was…. late. But once I got on I enjoyed the trip to the middle southern bayside suburbs. One of the first things I noticed was that the trees in the botanical gardens, and also along the train tracks had all lost their leaves, completely. Before I left there were masses of orange and yellow and red… and now… just nothing but branches and twigs. A lot can change in 3 weeks!  Another change is that the eureka tower is now up to 64 storeys and still going up… I think it’s jumped up quite a bit since I last saw it… I can’t wait till it is finished so I can go to the viewing platform and look down over the city, I think that would be really nice.  Anyway I eventually got to work, albeit a little late. This was the worst possible day to be late, as everyone would be waiting for me to come in, and everyone would KNOW I was late. As luck would have it, no one made any comments about my lateness and I settled back in quietly and did my research on what had changed in the past 3 weeks. With the federal budget being announced during my absence, quite a lot had changed- so I spent all of my research time… researching! Absolutely no time to catch up on the hundreds of emails that were waiting for me in my inbox!  A couple of hours into it, everyone came around and sang happy birthday to me for last week. I really hate this, because I get terribly embarrassed. (everyone knows I am getting older!) but I thanked everyone for putting in for my gift (which was a myer gift voucher) and lots of cake. Yummo.  A couple of meetings later, it was back to work, and it was remarkably easy. Everyone coming through was asking the same question over and over again, so that was good as well (no complicated questions for my first day back- I love it!)  Before I knew it, it was time to go home. I was surprised (I don’t know why) that the sun set before I had finished up for the day. I don’t think I have worked past sunset before- normally I would set my schedule so I went home when it was still daylight. It was interesting to see the city light up from my window seat.  The trip home was not as bad as I was dreading either. I had plenty of time to eat my nut and raisin mix on the way home on the train and re-read the Age.  All in all, going back to work was not as bad as I had imagined it would be. I would still, of course, much rather be on holidays though! I think as well I am happy where I am working now as well, no need to look for a new job just yet!  Catchyas

      Today really is a sad sad day. Tomorrow I will find myself back at work. This time tomorrow, I will be sitting on a train coming home…. I am not really looking forward to it at all.  For the last day of my holidays, I really ended up doing nothing at all. Infact, for my week in Melbourne, I ended up doing nothing much at all, all week, which is in a way a bit of a disappointment. I wanted to go to the new wave festival of unpopular culture. I think if I was not sick earlier in the week, I probably would have ended up going out to the city again. In a way it is probably just as well that I did not end up going out again, as I would have just spent more money, which is not always a good thing!  I watched a movie today (a very rare event indeed!)- Swim Fan… It is not the best movie I have seen, but it was still pretty good all the same. I don’t know why though we cannot have our own movies- using Australian actors, locations etc. The thing about American movies that puts me off is that the culture is so different to the one that I know of over here. I end up hating most of the characters, mainly because they really would not be the sort of people I would be friends with in real life. Perhaps I read too much into movies and the characters? I just want to see a film (or films!) with characters I can relate to in them. That is not too much to ask is it? Anyway……………  I realised today I did not do what I REALLY wanted to do these holidays, and that is go to the local beach here. It is relatively close by, but still too far to walk to. Perhaps I should just buy a bike so I can ride there whenever I feel like going there. There have been a couple of good beach days this last week, so I will have to make up for it one day soon.   Anyway I feel like going back and watching some more television- the block is on now (not that I really watch it, but there seems to be nothing else on!) and then big brother eviction and the final of my restaurant rules.

      This morning I woke up rather late- about 10:30am…. Like I have been saying heaps lately- I really need to get into the habit of going to bed early and waking up even earlier if I am not to feel and look like a zombie next week when I go back to work. I, still, am really not looking forward to going back to work. I like doing nothing too much.  Just after lunch time, we went to visit my partner’s brother’s family. I was really not in the mood for visiting people at all. In fact I felt like staying home and having another nap before doing anything else. But we went over there all the same, where I parked myself in front of the television and watched BBC world. One of my favourite shows, Holiday, was about to commence and I did not want to miss it. I ended up watching the show, and then decided to watch some more television- as I was still feeling not at all in the mood to be social- even though I was at someone else’s house.  Once I realised how rude I was being, I decided to get up and start chatting to Samantha. After a couple of coffees, we were really getting stuck into conversation, and one of Samantha’s friends came over, and we continued to chat about nothing in particular.  Later into the evening, it was time to get into the heated outdoor spa. It was finally ready to go, so I went outside wearing nothing but a pair of shorts (it was 10 degrees) and jumped into the spa.. (it was 36 in there)… lovely… I stayed there for a couple of hours before getting out, and soon after, I came home to watch the bill. I was pretty boring after that, making only a steakburger for dinner, and just watched more television.   I learnt a little more German before finally going to bed, but apart from that, today was pretty uneventful.

      I really really REALLY need to start going to bed earlier and waking up earlier before Monday. I am going to feel like shit all next week if I don’t get myself into the habit of going to bed before 2am (preferably closer to about 10pm!!!) and getting out of bed at 10am (compared to 6am next week!). I am still enjoying it all though in the meantime anyway- lazing about doing nothing much all day… staying up late… waking up late… and doing nothing much the day after. I love holidays.   I don’t think I will get back to the city again like I wanted to again during these holidays. If I do go back one day, it will hopefully be to check out digital cameras. I keep thinking back to last Friday when I was in the city, and all of those things I wanted to take photos of. Melbourne is a very photogenic city. Rainforests, snow, grassy plains, the sea, the suburbs and the city are all here… or close enough anyway…   Changing topic completely, one of the first things I did this morning was to check my email to see if my work schedule had come through for the next 4 weeks. Luckily it did come through, which saved me writing an email to work asking for it. I start work at 8:45 on Monday- and as I thought, I get about 3 hours of research time to catch up on all that I missed over the past three weeks. I am not really looking forward to it though, as there will be lots of distractions. I will have a happy birthday thing done for me- a cake and a gift voucher given to me (most likely) and that will take up about half an hour or so, and then I will have everyone coming over to me asking me how my holiday was. I think I should just say it was shit to get everyone to stay away until after I have caught up with everything and then tell them what a wonderful time I had away…. (along with the photos to prove it!)  Much later in the day (after re-watching an episode of Martha Stewart living that I watched late the night before), I went to Bi-Lo for the first time to do some grocery shopping. It, to me, markets itself as the discount supermarket sibling of Coles. I do not know why, but to me, all discount supermarkets have dim lighting and seem to be more depressing places to be in when compared to Coles and Safeway. The labelling on the shelves, to the uniforms of the staff all seem depressing to me. Perhaps it is just me? I don’t know, but what is important is the prices… and they were really cheap in there. I bought so much crap, and it cost less than $250- so I was really impressed with that. I bought 5kg of potatoes…. But they cost $3.50 or so- I am not sure what I am going to do with all of them now that I have them… lots of chippies on the menu perhaps? I also got 3kg of oranges- but I plan on making them into juice with an orange press that I have. In the end I was pleasantly surprised by the value of bi-lo at Werribee. I will have to go there again sometime in the future. I am thinking that perhaps it is cheap there because there is an Aldi just up the road.. oh well who cares- its all good for me as long as it is cheap!  I did not do much lounging about in the sun today, as it was mainly cloudy and rather cool outside- only getting up to 13 degrees today. It is definitely a lot sunnier and drier here compared to the other parts of Melbourne. I can look out to the east and see it being all cloudy and rainy over the eastern suburbs, but over here- it is just cloudy- only a couple of spits of rain… I don’t know why more people don’t move out here at all. The weather is definitely nicer out this way. Like when I go to work out in the east- it can be cloudy there all day, and then I come home only to be told how wonderfully sunny it has been there all day.   I learnt of a fun new revenge trick in the newspaper today. Apparently if you are splitting up with someone or are having a major fight with someone- the thing to do is throw alfalfa seeds into their carpet, and water them. You can imagine what happens next… I thought it was quite amusing, but I don’t think I see myself getting as vindictive as that at all. If anything I am someone who does not really care too much about things…. (which, in itself sometimes causes more disagreements than anything else- but that’s another story altogether!)  You may have noticed, I am getting back into my lazy way of updating these blogs again- I write them each day and save them to disk, uploading my entries once a week or so…. I don’t think I have that much traffic coming through my site so I don’t think its too important for me to upload everyday… but yeah… if you are reading this regularly…. That’s the reason why there are huge amounts of updates getting done all at once….  I have not shaved since last Saturday… I like not shaving… just thought I’d share that with you all…  It’s time for me to go and learn some more german… Catchyas!

      I seem to have this thing about waking up before I am really ready to get up and out of bed. I wonder why we can’t just sleep in until we are good and ready to get up and face the day. Even if one has nothing at all planned for the entire day (like me most days), it is still not nice to get up before your body has truly recovered from the day before. It would be nice to live in a world that does not require a coffee or two in the morning before the thought of being nice to others comes to mind.   This made me think…. Do I (and many other people I know!) wake up shitty in the morning, and stay that way until they have their morning coffee (or tea or whatever stimulant they can find) because that’s how we naturally are, or is it because we have grown addicted to this stuff- and wake up in a not so chirpy and bubbly mood out of habit…. Even addiction to caffeine? For myself as well, I have, I suppose grown addicted to having a drink of LA Ice cola while having dinner (and lunch, and even through the day at work!) I know before I started drinking the stuff a couple of years ago, I never used to drink softdrinks.. but now it seems to be with every meal. Again- it is the caffeine…. Am I addicted to it? Is it just a habit that needs to be broken?  My challenge for winter will be to stay away from cola (and other fizzies) for as long as possible… Yeah, I know, I probably will get through a couple of hours before I revert to the caffeine drinks…. Oh well… Its nice to think to yourself that you can actually achieve these things… it’s the thought that counts… right? Perhaps not, but just don’t tell me that!  Today was rather cool and showery. Just fantastic when you take a week off work to be supposedly on holidays. My sickness earlier in the week threw away any plans I may have had to go away somewhere locally this week. The only joy I get from having this week off work is that I get to recover from my holiday to Queensland, and also I get to sun myself on the lounge… (when it isn’t raining!)  I still am not particularly looking forward to going back to work at all. But at the same time, I might just be getting  a little bored of sitting at home all day as well. I really need to get my licence so I can get out and about a lot more. Then again, I really can’t be arsed to pay for lessons. I last went for driving lessons 3 years ago I think. I only just learnt how to put a car into reverse, manually, before I got too busy for further lessons and have never gone back since. I seeing a lot of deals now that offer free retesting if you fail your first driving test. I think those should be for me. I have absolutely no confidence in my driving ability at all. The longer I leave it though, the worse it is going to get.  My main motivation at the moment for getting a licence is not the fact that I can drive about all weekend enjoying myself, but rather it seems to be a pre-requisite for most jobs now that the applicant (me) has a drivers licence. I wonder if a learner’s permit is enough? I really only got that in the first place for identification purposes…. I had no intention at the time of actually going for my licence… anyway…..  I just thought of a memory of one of the last times I was in Brisbane… Quite an unpleasant experience at Roma Street Station- I went to buy train tickets (their ticketing system isn’t integrated there like it is here) to the other side of the river- and the bitch at the ticket booth was most unhelpful, and really quite rude as well. Making snide comments about victoria and victorians. I was embarrassed to have grown up in Queensland at all from how she was talking. Anyway I called for the station master and made a complaint. I don’t know what the point of writing all of this in this blog is at all really… probably to point out that it is not too hard to find stupid people like this in Queensland… we have a saying here for people from Queensland… “folks are dumb where I come from”… it’s a little ditty that’s meant to be sung…. And infers that all Queenslanders are dumb (except of course yours truly!) I used to hate it but thinking about little things like that, I have to wonder… ;)   I read an article about the Queensland premier a while back, and he said that people down here don’t think of his people like that anymore… (but he also infers that it was actually an accurate reflection of his population say 20 years ago). Hmmmmm… I wouldn’t  be so sure of that mr beattie!  Anyway back to my day- I did nothing much at all. I had a nap in the late afternoon. I went over my German quite a bit. And apart from that, I don’t think I did anything much really!   I ordered some vegetarian Singapore noodles for dinner. It was not very vegetarian though, it had egg all through it. The vegetables were shit as well. Why do they just give you the stalks of everything in vegetarian meals? I twist and snap off the stalks of things at the supermarket- and leave them there, only buying and eating the heads. I had to go through my noodles picking out all the egg and stalks of things. In the end I really only ate noodles.   Its like how I like my pasta. Instead of fancy sauces and meats etc, I really just prefer to have cooked spaghetti with tomato sauce on it. No different than for noodles- I just had it with tomato sauce over them tonight. It already had a mild thai curry flavour to it, but yeah, I like everything with tomato sauce. I even have been known to eat oranges with a little tomato sauce on them. YUM YUM YUM.  Anyway there is not much else happening today. I got a late (very late!) happy birthday call from my dad while I was in the shower… or rather I got the voicemail from him! I tried to call-back but could not get through. Next year perhaps!  Talking of voice mail and other messages- I am now starting to get sick of getting those sms’ that I get all the time now from connex informing me that a train has been cancelled. It seems to be 4-5 trains a day lately- and I only have my phone service notify me of cancellations between 6-9am and 3-7pm, and that’s only on the train lines between my house and my work! You have to wonder how many other cancellations there are through the day across the entire network. It only seems to be getting worse as well, which is not a good thing. I have been tempted to update my notification service so that I am informed of all cancellations and alterations…. For the entire day! I wonder…… I would probably be inundated with sms alerts all day. I’ll save that task for a day when I am truly bored out of my mind I think!  Catchyas

      At last, I am starting to feel better. That doctor on Monday was very accurate- how did he know to give me a medical certificate that would run out on the very day I felt good enough to go to work (if I was not on holidays!) Despite feeling exponentially better than I had the past couple of days, I did not do anything much today.   I spent the greater part of the morning sunning myself on the lounge chair while watching television. I am truly going to miss this when I go back to work. If there is ever a reason to look forward to getting really old (old enough not to be working any more!); this is it. There is, in my opinion, nothing better than laying down on the couch, in full sunlight, while watching television in winter. I love it. Luckily for me, my desk at work is right next to a north facing window (ceiling to floor window I might add…), so I do get to sit in the sun all day at work anyway, but it is just not the same. I doubt I would be allowed to lay on the carpet at work dressed in my shorts and socks only (though I should try it one of these days!)  Getting closer to midday, the cloud came over and it started to rain a little. It then became really cold inside and I had to put on some more clothes. How inconvenient. I went outside after the shower and inspected my bulbs that I had planted a couple of months ago. They are all looking really good. Most of them have come up, which is a really good thing. There are a few (that I didn’t plant!) that do not seem to be coming up. I have tried to find the bulbs in these areas to replant them in a more sunlit area- however I have not found any yet- so I am thinking maybe there were none planted there in the first place.   In the afternoon, I put on foxtel digital radio. I think foxtel digital is not worth the money I am paying for it. Only six extra channels and an extra $35- not very nice at all. I was getting radio anyway in the past with satellite analogue service I was getting- so I don’t know where they get off by saying we have soooo much more choice now. Having said that, I do need my how to channel and tech tv. Why can’t they let us choose which channels we want to watch- on a channel by channel basis? In all the packages there is shit I would never watch and stuff I would be really interested in watching. I think it is just their way of ripping us off even more. I am seriously considering cancelling my subscription altogether. I was living ok without it- while I waited the 3 months to get the bloody thing installed in the first place. This will be something I need to consider in the coming months, especially as I start paying back my substantial tax office bill.  About that tax office bill, I found out today in the paper that interest incurred in the repayment of tax office debt is tax deductible. In other words, I get my marginal tax rate back on the value of the interest I pay back to the ATO. Maybe if I get a job there they will waive my debt altogether…. Or maybe not! ;p I will see if I can get away with paying back $65 a fortnight to it- so I can focus on repaying higher effective interest credit that I have outstanding… hmmm…  All you young kiddies out there- DON’T EVER GET A CREDIT CARD!!! ;) definitely not worth it in the end.   Also in the paper today were hints and tips on how to maximise your tax return…. All very interesting. I should really keep all my receipts for things like pens and paper I get for work…. Then again I get it all free from the stationery room anyway! I should make the most of my deductions this year, and next year too, because I found out that if you owe the tax office money, they will take your refund and pay it straight to your debt that you have with them…. So if it means less money from my pocket … its all good! (yeah yeah I  know its all from my pocket anyway lol)  Later in the evening, I learnt some more German. I am getting good at it, well lesson one anyway! I am enjoying all the word and grammar and vocab games in the program I am using and yeah… I’ll be writing this blog in German before you know it (or maybe not….)  I got a phone call from my nz buddy reymond at about 8:30. We chatted for an hour about nothing in particular. It is very unusual with us- how we are friends and all, because we have never met in person. Not once! How it all started was I used to be pretty big on (how embarrassing!) pen pals- and my pals and I used to swap these things called “friendship books”, where you would write your address and vital stats on a page about 4cm by 4cm and you would send it onto someone else, who would put their details on the next page and so on until it was full, where you would then send it back to the originator.   ANYWAY- one day I came across his name and details in one of the books, so I wrote, and soon we were writing letters that were 20pages long, 40… and by the end of it, we were sending letters that were well over 100 pages long to each other!! (Unbelievable I know, but true!). Then came university, and email, so we stopped sending paper letters and started using chat and email, and now it is the occasional email, and occasional hour long phone call… He surprises me all the time though, by telling me stories I told him from a few years ago. Some of them truly outrageous- I didn’t know I used to be like that! But it all good hey, because at the time I was ok with it and yeah- no need, or reason, to be shamed over what you did when you were younger right? ;)  Anyway after that enjoyable and fun conversation with rey, (whose weblog is today’s “steves link of the day” {just click on the title of today’s entry to get to the link…}) I went to go and watch more television. Today was the first day in all of my holidays that I have not had a nap through the day- so I was by this time feeling very tired. I thought if I don’t want to feel like shit when I go back to work, I will have to start sleeping normally and ease myself back into the 6am wake ups that I will have to endure everyday when I go back to work.   I am definitely not looking forward to going back to work. I want to stay home and do nothing all day. I am so lazy. At this time, becoming a dole bludger is looking like an ideal career option. But then, I would not be able to buy as many bikkies and lollies as I do now… heheh  Anyway nothing much more to write for today. Thankfully I am feeling a lot better today than I have recently. Perhaps I will be able to go out for a day trip sometime this week to a place out of town. I have not really been out of Melbourne much since I have moved here, so it would be nice.  Catchyas!

      Today I woke up feeling worse than yesterday. Yeah yeah call me a whinge, but I can complain so I will- it’s my blog! ;p  I went straight for the orange juice this morning, in the hope it would make me feel a little better. Well, better than what a cup of coffee would have made me feel like anyway. I went and opened the blinds, and watched some more television. I am really enjoying these holidays- despite the fact I am now sick with a sore throat and fever. Not having to go to work everyday is fantastic. Not having to actually do any work at all is even better. And then not having to rush around and do everything in the 3 hours I am awake when I do get home from work is even better.   I am starting to think I should just apply for and take any transfer opportunities that pop up out this way. It would really save me time and let me sleep in now and again! Don’t get me wrong- I really enjoy the work that I do, but I don’t think I can be bothered with the commute anymore.   I have been thinking also about getting a new job altogether. I think I am too lazy though to do anything about it. I also don’t think I would be able to live on a lower salary again either- so taking time from work for study purposes is definitely out. I had even thought about becoming a train driver on the metropolitan network yesterday! I had a dream about it last night, and I think the outcome of it was, that due to the fact I don’t even have a drivers licence or a car, I would not really like being a met driver- as I would not be able to do the late or early shifts- so until I get my act together and get a licence and car- I don’t think I will becoming a train driver… (well not yet anyway- let me check out their conditions and salary in their certified agreement and I will get back to you on that one!)  Today was somewhat cooler than yesterday- only about 17, though most of the day seemed to be under 15 degrees. I just sat in the sun on the lounge, until the cloud cover came and made me put the heaters on.   By midday, I was getting really tired- from the early starts of the last couple of days, so I went and had a nap. I think I had a couple of naps, because I think I remember waking up, and still feeling tired, just shut my eyes and went back to sleep again. I was out for over 2 and a half hours- so I definitely think I had a couple of naps in one. I woke up feeling slightly worse, but I always feel like that just after I get up from a nap. I was soon feeling better- after I had some minestrone soup for lunch.  From there, it was just a lazy couple of hours watching the television. I made some spaghetti for dinner- delicious. Later on tonight I WILL get into the german and learn some more of that. I am still on lesson one. My plan is to get through a lesson a week- but we’ll see how that goes when I start going to work again next week- I might have to make it one lesson every 2 weeks.   I might even catch up on some more tv shows I recorded while I was away on holidays.   One last thing- I was going through my backlog of papers earlier today- and I saw day after the federal budget was announced, there was a huge ad on the second page of the paper, directing the public to call my department with any and all queries regarding the budget announcements and initiatives. I am so glad I took holidays when I did. It would have been absolutely frantic in there- everyone calling to see what they could be entitled to. I will have loads to catch up on when I get back- hopefully I will get the 3 hours research time I asked for right at the beginning of my day next Monday. Heres hoping!  I don’t think there is anything else to write about today. I have not really bothered thinking about things lately (in holiday mode you see!) so this is turning into more of a diary than anything else. I suppose it doesn’t matter- after all it is my blog right? ;)  Catchyas

      As I have the past few years, I stayed up past midnight on 23/05/04 to see in my birthday. As always as well, I took the day (well week in this case) off work. I did nothing exciting, unless you call watching Martha Stewart and some other stuff on Tech TV until 2 in the morning exciting! I was still sick with a sore throat, so did not have a bikkie like I normally do on my birthday. That will have to wait until later on in the week.   I slept in until about 9:30am. The phone was ringing and woke me up. I knew I should have unhooked the phone the night before. Do not disturb- well not until at least midday anyway on my birthday. You never know just what I may have gotten up to the night before. In this case it was ok (well sort of) but still, you never know! I stayed in bed and ignored the phone. It rang a couple of more times before it was handed to me- I was pretty much *told* to speak to whoever it was who was calling me. It was mum- wanting to wish me a happy birthday.  I was not in the best of moods at this time- one because I had woken up with a very sore throat and was still not feeling too well, and the other, the phone had woken me up before my time- and I was still half asleep and shitty for being woken up early. I am glad I got the call anyway, but I think next year I will have to take my phone off the hook and turn off all mobiles before I go to bed birthday eve!  One of the first things I did after taking that call and waking myself up with a nice coffee was to call the local medical practice to arrange an appointment to see a doctor to get a medical certificate. I know- I am already on holiday leave, however at my work, I am able to convert my holiday pay into sick pay where I can prove I was sick on my holidays. I thought I may as well go and do this. I am sitting at home sick on my holidays (and MY birthday)- and why shouldn’t I get this counted as sick leave? Also, whenever I leave (or am fired!) from that place, I will not be able to cash out my sick pay, but I will be able to cash out my outstanding holiday entitlements- so why not top my holiday pay balance by paying back some of it as sick leave….??? Well I thought it was a good idea anyway… let’s see if they put me on the list of people who have to produce a medical certificate everytime they call in sick now!  Anyway once I had done that, I noticed that the clouds and wind of yesterday had disappeared. It was turning out to be a very warm and sunny day. I went out into the garden and did some weeding. I do not know where all these weeds come from, nor do I know how they manage to grow in the bark chip mulch stuff that’s covering our garden beds. I did not think weeds were supposed to be able to grow in that environment- but evidently, they can.  I was really noticing the heat of the sunlight on me as I was out doing the weeding. It was a different heat than that of Queensland. In Queensland, the heat is one that gently warms your entire body. Here, the sensation is more of a searing heat on your skin…. Nothing nice about that- even if it was only 20 degrees in the shade!  By this time (about midday) I was feeling a little special about my big day. I was noticing the dates on the newspaper, the tv guide- all showing *MY* birthday. Today is all about me (when ISNT it all about me? ;p) As I was still feeling sick though, I did nothing (as you should on your birthday) and just watched television. Really enjoyable! No work, no worries.  I sat in the sun for the next few hours. On the lounge chair, with the blinds opened, so that the sun was streaming into the living room. The indoor/outdoor thermometer was reading 32 degrees inside the house, and about 21 outside. I am thinking that while it is very nice to have this warmth on me now nearing winter, I am dreading to think how hot it will get inside this place once it starts getting over 40 degrees outside in summer. I suppose then the blinds will be shut first of all, and the angle of the sun would mean that in summer a lot less direct sunlight would be coming in as well. But anyway, I was there, laying on the couch, sunning myself for a few hours. What a truly wonderful way to spend your birthday. By the way, later this night, I learnt that today was officially the hottest May 24th on record for Melbourne. 21 degrees. To me it felt very nice and warm and toasty in the sun. I didn’t think I would be saying it this early in the season- (but we all knew it was coming anyway…)- I CANT WAIT UNTIL SUMMER!!!! Perhaps I should just move back to north Queensland and enjoy the nicer weather up there????  I went to my medical appointment at 3pm. There was a bit of an inconvenient wait to begin with, as I had never been to a surgery out in this area before. The poor receptionist was being run off her feet- a million things happening all at once. I felt sorry for her, but also admiration at how she was able to manage that huge workload. Of course- I was not in a mood to encourage her at all, as I was feeling sick and sorry for myself. I mean- how on earth could I have fallen sick- today- of all days. Could it not have waited until at LEAST next Monday- when I am due back at work? How inconvenient.  I finally got to see the doctor. I was surprised when he reached for an old flashlight to look down my throat with. I was thinking to myself how typical this was of an older Chinese man- very very thrifty. At least he was not using recycled ice cream sticks to hold my tongue down with! He was very honest though. A little too honest. I asked for a medical certificate for work. He questioned me and asked why I needed one at all. I, after all, only had a sore throat. I said I worked in a call centre (It took me almost 6 months to let you guys know that!) and having to go to work would make my sore throat even worse. Well that and the fact I don’t think my work would be able to give me alternative duties, or be willing to let me potentially infect other workers who would be less willing to come in and do non core duties.  I did not tell the doctor that I was already on holiday leave anyway- it would have caused more confusion for both of us in the end. I could not really understand him anyway! In the end though, I got my medical certificate covering me for 2 days (today and tomorrow) which is good. I also got my Medicare receipt- so now I have to go back and claim back the money for the consultation from the government. If I was not on holiday leave, I normally not bother going to the doctor to get a medical certificate, as it is simply not required. It is the last thing I want to do as well when I am sick- to go and wait in some doctors surgery around other sick people. I also see it as an unnecessary expense, and inconvenience. I mean, if I am so sick that I need to take more than about 2 days off work, I will go in and get checked out, but if it is a sore throat, and I know that this is all it is, I will not waste the time of the doctor or myself. If I had the energy to drag myself down to the doctors, I would have the energy to go to work.   By the time I was finished with my consultation, I felt it was time for a healthy pick me up- so it was off to hungry jacks for some chips and drink. Yum. I was not very hungry actually, as the sore throat had taken away much of my appetite, but I was finally in the mood for something greasy and easy.  I got home just in time to catch Martha again. I find her shows just fascinating. As if the average person would be able to afford some of the things she does and recommends. A “cheap” $5000 flower basket? Get real. It is a good show though, even if we are about 5 years behind in the programming!  Midway through the show, I got a sms from Connex. If I had been at work today, my train home would never have come. My first train home from work was cancelled today- for the first time ever. It was actually the first time one of my trains had been cancelled going to or from work (that I had been informed about via this sms service anyway). I was very thankful I chose to take holidays for this entire week, rather than be stuck at a train station waiting forever for a train to come by on my way home from work, on my birthday. (For more insight as to how I view my birthday- check out that ab fab episode where Edwina goes on and on about her ‘bloody birthday’…) ;p  As I was still feeling sick, I had a nice hot bath. I stayed in there for well over an hour. It doesn’t compare at all with going to a nice warm beach in Queensland (like I was a couple of weeks ago!) but all the same, it was very relaxing and nice. I felt somewhat better upon getting out of the bath and into my trakkies.   I did pretty much nothing else for the remainder of the night, except watching lots of television. I realised who was going to win the apprentice tonight as well. When it first started- I looked up on google who was going to win it. I did not really pay much attention to the people up until tonight- where I heard the winners name mentioned- now I know who to watch over the next few weeks as the show comes to an end.  I was too sick today to do much learning of German. I will have to leave that until tomorrow.  Other than that, well yeah- a pretty quiet one for me. I do not go much for celebrating things like Christmas, or birthdays and things like that. I think if you really appreciate someone, you should be able to give them gifts and love any day of the year. There is no point in going out of your way on these few days to show your feelings to someone who should already know what you think about them. If they don’t know, I’d say you’ve got some problems in your relationship with that person. Like I said as well, I am not too fussed about these things either- just another day off work to me!

      today i think i woke up with a hangover- well i think it was a hangover- it has been a while since i have felt this way! it must have been the bourbon...  i got up at the nice time of 10:15am... i am at last catching up on some sleep!  i went to read the paper, had a coffee, and then played a little simcity 3000. i had planned go and learn some more german- but i dont feel up to it today  after eating a couple of handfuls of those strawberry and cream lollies- we went to coles to go shopping. i found that i could  not use my colesmyer card- because i missed one payment of $10. nevermind the fact i have kept this card at a zero balance for the past several months. cunts. i had thoughts of cutting up the card and burning it- which is something i will do one day- but not just yet. i think i had better just pay the $15 that is now owing and be done with it. coles myer- your card scheme just sucks. i could not even use one of their phones (at the supermarket) to call the callcentre and find out why my card had been blocked (this is something you CAN do at myer). i just used my savings and was out of there as fast as possible- very pissed off with coles and the inconvienience of having my card barred when all i owe on it is $10. how rediculous.   by the afternoon- i was starting to feel a different kind of sick. as i was getting over the hangover- i started getting a sore throat- and that sensation of being cold and hot at the same time. i hope i am not coming down with tonsillitis again. then again- it will be kind of good as i will be able to convert my recreation leave to sick leave and take more holidays later on... woo hoo  i had an afternoon nap- in the hope that i would feel better upon waking up- unfortunately i didnt and i still feel shit.  this means i will be sick (for the first time) on my birthday- which is tomorrow- on the 24th of may (where i am actually turning.... 24!)  hey that reminds me of the name of a band- this time tomorrow- a guy i used to work with plays bass in it- you should all go and see them play one of these days- they are pretty good!  with me feeling like shit for most of the day- there is little for me to write on about- except i am glad that igor is out of the big brother house... and what about that discusson on citizenship in the house this week? i agree with that older dude- you are not really an aussie until you make it legal and become a citizen- if you dont pay taxes and dont vote- you are not one of us... (sorry guys but thats my view on this!)  anyway time to get going- 2 hours until i turn 24... noooooooooooooo  catchyas!

      saturday- my first weekend back in melbourne.....  i managed somehow to sleep in until about 9am... not too late but it seemed to be anyway after waking up very early everyday for the past couple of weeks.  i had planned to go out shopping to get a present for nick- my partners nephew who was turning 10 tomorrow (but was having a party tonight). i still wanted to get one of those bikechain lanyards- however resigned myself to the fact i was not probably going to find one at all in this city- well not until after i needed it anyway.  i was reading the sunday age today when i came across another guy who blogs in this website as well- that famous dude from iraq- i think his blod is dear-raoul... or something like that... i think it is pretty full on how just by writing a blog like this- you get movie and book deals offered to you... and you get whisked around the world to talk about your life story. i dont think that will ever happen to me- my life is too boring lol.... but yeah- i thought good on him- if he gets this just by writing about himself- then excellent  actually for most of the afternoon- i was reading the saturday age in the sunlight,sitting on the carpeted area of my living room... (my living room is a little weird- in that there is a patch of submerged carpet in the middle where the lounges are, then the rest of the area, including the kitchen, is tiled....).. anyway yeah i was thinking in summer how nice it would be to be sprawled all over the carpet, reading my paper in the sunlight through winter... it was as every bit as perfect as i thought it would be... i love the gentle warmth of the sun in winter! (that the the fact it is near impossible to get a tan here in winter- and i HAVE tried!!!)... well.. let me just think that for now- i am still secretly missing the tropical heat of my holiday that i have just come back from. i am so going to become one of those retiree caravaners who journey up to queensland every winter!  anyway, after reading my paper, i had a nap- only to be awoken by some idiot walking around trying to sell 7day subscriptions to the herald sun newspaper. i cant stand the herald sun- too trashy and tabloidish for me.. everything is a scandal in that paper... and anyway- i already have a 7 day subscription to the age :)  thinking of door to door salesmen- we actually get quite a lot in this area. maybe because it is new? i dont know... in seaford- we never got ONE door to door salesperson... infact- i cant ever remember having one turn up on my door and try to sell me something- but since moving here- it seems to happen daily- and always for something different! I think i might have to invest in a no hawkers or salespeople sign on my door or something.....  back to my day- mid afternoon- i had a shower and got ready to go to nicks party. it was not a kids party in the traditonal sense- it was more of a gathering of family and a couple of friends- so there were not as many screaming kids as would be normal for a kids party (thank god). i was warned that one of the kids who would be attending has chickenpox at the moment- i am hoping that i do not get it again. i had thought you can only get chickenpox only once- but apparently a couple of my cousins had gotten it twice... hmmmm...  anyway we are at the party and i am having a great time getting into the peach wine (ok ok my secret is out!!! i actually drink that stuff!!) and chatting to nicks mother- samantha (who is my partners sister in law). we were having a great time bitching about someone we both loathe- when we suddenly had to stop, due to other party guests arriving.. (well it is rude to bitch about someone when not everyone feels the same way- unfortunately!)  for nick, we just gave him $50... he turned out to be a rich boy that night- getting over $300 i think in cash. he is saving up to get a mongoose bike... he can get me one too please! i still want to get a bike myself- but i will probably settle for something cheap and basic (cos thats the kind of trashy guy i am!) :)  a few hours into the night- i get into a few more peach wines, and also some bourbon and coke. my mother called me while i was at the party- and i had to go and explain to her how to add an attachment to an email using the email program. then samantha got out her collection of 80's LP's... kim wylde, bananarama, kiss, madonna... oh my god some of those records are older than i was! (and i was a bastard and told her so as well lol) but yeah some good tunes. then we got out the 80's party cd's and had a bit of a dance- fun fun fun  inbetween all of this i was in nicks room watching over 4 pre teens making sure they were not hurting eachother- they were having a great time playing WWE with each other- wrestling and kickboxing... it was all in good fun and there was no anger in any of it... there was one pshyco kid there though- but we wont go there because i think his parents might one day read this!  anyway much later on in the night- it was time to go (i know sounds pretty boring, but i had a good time- even though i didnt do much!) so we kissed everyone goodbye and left... i said to samantha she will have to get her outdoor spa fixed so we can have a spa party (something she is famous for lol).. so expect to read something about that pretty soon!  when we got home- i ran to the television- my new zealand news was about to come on- i wanted to put a link to the news on this entry- but tv3 seems to have changed their website... anyway yeah it was good to catch up on what was happening in new zealand all last week...  i dont know why i am so obsessed with new zealand- or why i just HAVE to watch new zealand news week... i bet i go there one day and hate it (well i hope not!!!) but yeah.. it seems to be very similar, but different to australia...if i were to live there i imagine i would live on the south island- in the cantebury region perhaps... but i really want to visit the west coast of the south island... so rugged and natural!  speaking of cold places.... i have noticed that since coming back from queensland- i have felt very cold all the time- not just a little chilly, but cold to the bone... i dont know why i feel the cold so much- because before i left- i was running around in shorts and tshirts when it was like 12 degrees and sunny... and now when i wear socks, trakkies, shirts and jumpers- i still feel cold- and that is when i am inside a heated house, in the sunlight, when it is about 20 degrees! i hope i get over this soon and get used to melbourne weather again- because it is only going to get colder as winter goes on!  enough from me for today.. time to get going  catchyas

      I woke up in a better mood than I had gone to bed in last night. I am getting over no longer being on holidays! Today I caught the 10:30 bus to Laverton station, for a train to the city. My main aim was to buy a chain lanyard for a kid who is turning 9 in a couple of days time. The kid is my partners nephew, and I get along really well with the entire family, so I thought I may as well go out and get something for him.  I saw what I really wanted to buy in Townsville last week. It was a lanyard made of bike chain. However, upon reaching Melbourne, none of the shops stocked any form of metallic lanyard, let alone one made of bike chain. I am starting to think that they are illegal down here- as I can see how they could be used as a weapon…. However I did see a couple of guys wearing them at Hoppers Crossing station, and also in Bourke Street mall, so you must be able to get them somewhere! (just not in the city so it seems!)  When I got to Flagstaff station, I changed trains and went from platform 4 to 3, and got the train to Glen Waverley, where I got off at Richmond. My team leader at work told me several weeks ago about this shop under Richmond train station. It apparently sold all sorts of graf material and shirts and records. I thought I’d check it out as I am into it- as an observer, and I also like the fashion that goes with it. I found it easily enough, it is called “This is it”…. I thought it was pretty sparse, but I managed to find a shirt I liked. I am really into the brand “Materialism”, so I bought one of their tees. I was also looking for some burncrew shirts as well, but it seems the only places that I know to stock them don’t anymore. Oh well. The inconvenience of this is it is that they do not accept cards at all. So I had to find a cashpoint and come back (which I did).  After visiting there, I went off to find some new shoes. I have been admiring the new offerings from Puma lately. I think they kinda look retro so wanted to have one for myself. I ended up getting a pair of Puma Avanti’s. I got the one in white with navy stripe. I think I may have gotten them a size too small, so I might have to take them back for a refund or exchange. I looked in a few shops for them, where they were selling for $160. I managed to get them though from Foot Locker for $99. Bargain.   After that, it was off to Myer, where I got a ribbed long sleeve round neck top from Kenji Urban (it was charcoal in colour), and then I also got a couple of tops from Yarra Trail, one in khaki and the other a chocolate brown. They will go well for a more formal, but casual setting….  In between all this, I went up and down through the laneways of Melbourne. I was very happy to find all these trendy shops hidden from view. Some of them were also hideously expensive- I walked into the Hugo Boss shop, where they were selling a coat for $5400, and also a PVC jacket for $2500. I don’t think I will bother with the real thing and will just buy fakes from now on lol.  I bought a lime coke from coles, and thought it tasted really nice. You will have to try one if you get it. I almost didn’t though, as I could not justify paying $2.69 for a 600ml bottle when at the same time I was getting 2 litres of Pepsi for $1.89. Curiosity got the better of me. That and the fact they were not selling any LA Ice…  I came home, had some lunch, and then went back onto the computer, this time to learn some German from a CD I bought in Townsville. I am very slowly getting the hang of it, and will hopefully get me back into studying again.   Today was colder than yesterday, but it was sunny. Albeit a very dim sunlight. I will get used to it though!  Through the day I started thinking (of all things!) aircraft etiquette. In particular, etiquette when leaving the craft after a long trip. I think people who have to retrieve luggage from the overhead compartment should stay in their seats until everyone else has gotten off. I found it to be really inconvenient to wait for people in front of me to ferret around in the overhead compartments while those behind had to wait and wait and wait. Both times I travelled on the way back, I was sitting at the rear of the plane. Getting off in Brisbane was not a problem as there was a rear exit and I was out straight away, but Melbourne- oh my god, I could not believe how slow some people were in getting their shit from the plane. Those of us who are organised and ready to just get off should be allowed to do so. There should be some sort of rule put into place to enforce this.  Anyway that is enough bitching for one day! Got to get going- see yas.

      Today was my first day back in Melbourne after my holiday. I miss the heat of the tropics already, but at the same time, I welcome the reassuring chill of the Melbourne air.   The first thing I noticed about Melbourne, looking outside in the morning, was that the sunlight is a lot dimmer (on a sunny day) than Queensland. I suppose we are about 20 degrees south of where I just was, but still… it seemed to be noticeably darker outside.   I spent the day catching up on TV shows that had been recorded for me while I was away. The Bill, My Restaurant Rules etc. I also went through several emails that had been waiting for me since my return.  I also had a bit of a play with my blog- by updating it so that people can now post comments at every entry if they want to. I would like to be able to add photos of what I do each day- but I am not sure how to do that just yet. I might have to set up my own site and host it on blogspot to do what I want to do…… we’ll see.  By the end of the day, I was feeling a little depressed. My holiday was over. I can now no longer sit outside and get hot just by sitting in the sun. No more going outside without a jacket and pair of trakkies. And definitely no more going for long long swims in the ocean. Well not until next time anyway. It is a shame this city was not built in the tropics. It would be absolutely perfect then. But overall, I would much rather live here than up there, so I guess I cannot complain too much!  Nothin else doing for today- time to get going..  Catchyas

      Today is my last day in Queensland. I woke up again a little chilly. It was about 7 degrees inside where I was staying- not as bad as the forecast 5 degrees that was expected that morning. First thing I noticed when I got up was that the curtains in the caravan were swaying- as if there were a breeze coming in from outside. What do you know- I have been sleeping with the windows wide open for the past couple of nights. At least I had some fresh air!  I went up to the house at about 7-ish, really early for me. I did not say much to anyone until after I had had my coffee. Nice.  After that, I had a bit of a chat with one of my cousins who told some interesting stories of what everyone had gotten up to as children. I was surprised to hear that one of them had shot at this cousin I was talking to with an airgun. What a psycho. I had imagined that this guy would be a bit of a nutter- but to actually shoot at someone like that- unbelievable.   Anyway after a bit of a chat, it was time to see them off. After they had left, I went for another bike ride down the road and around the farm. It was really nice to feel the warmth of the sun on me for a change. By this time, I had convinced myself that I would become one of those Victorians that come up and stay in north Queensland caravan parks all winter long. I really did not want to come down to Melbourne again and its coolish weather. I suppose it helped as well that every single day I spent in Queensland was sunny and warm with absolutely no rain at all. Perfect.   By lunch time, I was fully packed and had said goodbye to everyone. I gave grandmother one last hug before the journey to Rockhampton. Every time I say goodbye to her, I think it will be the last time I see her alive. I don’t seem to be too fussed by it though, and she does not seem to mind or think much of it either. Anyway I got one last picture taken of us, and yeah, off we went.   Before going to Rockhampton, we visited some relatives in Gracemere, just outside of Rockhampton. I did not particularly want to drop in there; I would have rathered staying on the farm for a couple of more hours. I do not really know those relatives at Gracemere and yeah, I could have been doing more interesting things at the farm- like getting a workout by riding that bike up and down some more dirt hills!  After the visit with the relatives, we went into Rockhampton, where my uncle had to order in some truck parts. It was very hot sitting in the shade there, well over thirty degrees. Before long though, we were off to the airport. I was expecting one of my cousins to come along, but she did not turn up at all. Oh well. I could not bring my uncle and mother inside the waiting area at all. Ticket holders only. This airport is more secure than Melbourne! And to think only a couple of years ago I was able to walk straight through to the plane without passing through security at all. Things have certainly changed!  I said my goodbyes to mum and uncle, and went into the waiting area. It was weird sitting in there, because it is a glassed in area, and they were waiting on one side of the glass, and I was there on the other. Instead of just looking at each other, I called her and we spoke through the glass via our phones. It was weird talking to her this way, as there was a slight delay between seeing her mouth move and hearing her voice. A weird thing as well as that we could not look at each other while talking on the phone in this manner. I know for me it felt rather stupid.  On the plane, it was one hour to Brisbane. We flew at 37000 feet, or a little over 11km I think. It was a really smooth flight, and I managed to do something which I had been wanting to do for ages- and that is see a sunset come over the land while up in the air. It is really spectacular to see darkness fall on the ground below you as you fly above, and then to see it consume the horizon, all the while being basked in sunlight myself as I looked outside the window. Just after sunset- it was arrival in Brisbane.   I had been worried about the flight being late into Brisbane, as I flew to Brisbane on Virgin, and then was going to go to Melbourne on Qantas. I had only given myself 90 minutes in which to pick up my luggage and check in and pass through security again at Brisbane. Here I was thinking how silly I was for doing this when I managed to get my luggage relatively quickly from that carousel thing. I was walking quickly to the Qantas terminal now, hoping the line would not be out the door. To my amazement and pleasure, I found that there was no queue at all, and I was able to walk straight through and check in my luggage. It was then straight through security, the wait here being even less than in Rockhampton! This is the fastest I have ever checked into an airport! Upon reaching the departure gate though, I learnt that my flight had been delayed by about 30 minutes, and as a result, I would now not be reaching Melbourne until about 10pm.  I walked around and around the terminal. Bored out of my mind. I found a couple of newspapers to read from Melbourne, and caught up on what had been happening back home in the past couple of days. I wanted to get something to eat, but the food was prohibitively expensive, and none of those places accepted eftpos at all. There was an ATM there, but for me it is a lot cheaper to just buy it using eftpos. And anyway, I could not justify paying $3 for a small cup of chips.  On the flight (at last!) I was very happy to find that I was seated at the very back of the plane, and I had the entire set of seats all to myself. This was the same as my flight from Rockhampton to Brisbane, where I also had the entire row of seats to myself, and I was sitting right at the back.  The food on the Qantas flight was really nice. I got some pasta with sun dried tomato, with some roast beef on top. This came with a bread roll and some chocolate. Yum. I declined the offer for a drink, as I am never sure as to whether you have to pay for these or not. I took onboard a compass- to see which direction the flight takes. I have been interested to know which towns I see from the plane during the day and also at night. For the entire journey, we flew south west (incase any of you were wondering!) About an hour out of Brisbane, I saw a big orange glow on the horizon- I am pretty sure it was Sydney- as it looked to be the right size for a bit city and also it stayed in the same relative position for over half an hour.  Upon descent into Melbourne, we did a bit of a loop over the city. I could see all of the western and northern suburbs, as well as the CBD. I really like looking at Melbourne and its skyline. It is even better at night as I like to see the entire city lit up. If you fly into Melbourne, you must do it at least once at night, preferably when it is clear like it was last night!  I got out of the plane, and the nice chill in the air welcomed me back home to Melbourne. A short while later, I was home, in bed, asleep. Welcome back!

      Well today is the last day I will be at my parents’ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so we’ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down there…. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my god…. Let’s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!)   After that, we continued our journey south. I read a book that mum had given- Crossing Over by John Edward. It was an interesting read- however I found it to be very similar to watching the television show in parts. I actually do believe in the things he writes about. Call me crazy, but sometimes I do feel as though the presence of those departed are around me. Also, at funerals- I never feel upset. I usually (well ALWAYS) get the feeling that the spirit of the deceased is around me, and that they are very much happier where they are. So I am the one trying to hide my smile when everyone else is upset. I do feel it is inappropriate that I feel strangely happy at funerals for those that die- but the way I see it- they are no longer suffering on earth anymore, and they are much happier where they are now. I don’t think many people understand the way I think about these things- and I know I have offended many as well. But hey- each to their own- I respect the thoughts of others on this matter, and thankfully, most respect mine as well.  Back to the bus trip! We stopped for lunch at some place called Koumala. I wondered if this was some sort of Greek name or is this meant something naughty in another language… probably not I imagined… Koumala is really just a roadhouse with really expensive food in it. I ended up just getting some more lollies to eat. I was not going to pay excessive amounts of money for something that was likely to taste crap.  Back on the bus again, and we passed through some more really really small towns. The landscape did not change much once we passed through Sarina and left the sugar cane country. Near sunset I looked out the window and saw a couple of wild kangaroos. Some of the backpackers on the bus were a bit excited about that!  Then finally, at about 6:15, we pulled into Rockhampton. It was still really warm there, probably mid 20’s. I went to get some milk from Doblos- a local independent retailer. I had wanted to go there because during summer, I saw on  a current affairs show (Today Tonight) that they were offering fuel vouchers (save 10c off per litre) to anyone who bought over $30 worth of goods from their stores. It made the news show because the local Safeway (locally known as Woolworths here) was matching it. (Everywhere else in Australia the discount is 4c per litre). Anyway I was disappointed to learn that the discount here was now only 6cper litre, and only able to be used at local petrol stations. Oh well, next time.  From there we went and visited one of my cousins and had dinner. I don’t know what it is about Queenslanders- but they seem to make interesting interpretations of all sorts of food. This time it was Lemon Chicken, but not how I am used to it in Melbourne. The lemon sauce here seemed to be creamy in texture and looks, and taste. This was something a bit unusual for me, as I am used to the lemon sauce being transparent, and a yellow colour. The rice was much starchier than I am used to as well. I should not bitch about this though, as I used to make food like this as well while I was still living up here. Anyway, because I was so hungry, I had 2 servings.   After that, it was off to my grandparents (otherwise known as ‘the farm’.) I suppose I cannot really call it my grandparents, as my grandfather (on mothers side of the family) died over 7 years ago, and my grandmother lives here with 4 of her sons (my uncles)- who have never permanently moved away (that I am aware of at least!). So I think I will just call it the farm from now onwards.   On the way out, I was absolutely amazed by all the stars I could see in the sky. I had thought I could see a lot of stars from the Western suburbs- but it is nothing compared to what you can see from this part of the world. There was no moon in the sky at all, yet the sky seemed to have a whitish tinge to it- not absolutely black. I could clearly see the milky way- beautiful in its appearance. I thought I could even see the comet that is visiting our skies at the moment! By the time we reached the farm though (just after 10:30pm), I did not wish to go sky gazing anymore. I just wanted to go to bed.   I went straight to bed- without even having a shower or washing my hair. I never do this, especially when my hair has freeze gel through it (and has had it in there all day!) But I was just too tired. Just after 11pm- I closed my eyes and went to sleep.

      Well today is the last day I will be at my parents’ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so we’ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down there…. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my god…. Let’s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!)   After that, we continued our journey south.

      Well, today is my last day up here in the tropics. Tomorrow I am on a bus all day while I travel to my grandparents, which is a little over 700km by road away. I cannot say that I am not looking forward to the trip, infact, it will be good to see all the open country again, however I usually cannot stand to sit still for more than a few minutes at a time, so it will be interesting to see how long it takes before I get bored.  Earlier today I went to the supermarket (I was shocked to find they now open on Sundays here- only 15 or so years behind Victoria!) and got some munchies for the bus trip. I got a pack of chicos, kool fruits, and some nuts and raisins... yum yum yum. I also got some water and also some orange/passionfruit juice. I don't think I will go hungry! I also got a chicken to eat as well as part of a salad sandwich. Yummo.   While at the supermarket, I ran into the little sister of an old schoolfriend of mine. Her mother is fijian, and father is irish, and they have I believe over 10 kids in the family! I was shocked to hear that my friends younger brother already has 2 children and is about to get married- it certainly has been a while since I was up there! Also my school buddy is now apparently working in Canberra in the army, as are a couple of his brothers and sisters. The entire family seems to be in the armed forces! It was good to see her again anyway and say hello.  Before that as well, we went to Queens Beach for their Sunday markets. The markets seemed to be really really small.. but then again, I can only compare them to Queen Victoria Market (one of the biggest in the world) and Laverton Markets- also one of the bigger ones in Melbourne. There were quite a few interesting things to buy there- but I ended up getting nothing. I was interested in getting a real leather belt made up for myself (a real bargain at only $25) however the leather for the belt that I wanted was too thick for the belt buckle I wanted. So I ended up coming home without anything at all! In the end all it means is that I will have to go to the city in Melbourne next week and get one from a department store or something.  I went down to the beach for a bit of a look as well; there seemed to be a lot less sand there than when I last was there. Unless the tide was high- but I had thought it would be low at that time of day from seeing the times on the news the night before. Anyway, something that slightly concerned me was seeing that the water was higher than the stinger enclosure nets- meaning that if there were marine stingers, they could easily get into the enclosure stinging people who would otherwise think it would be safe to go into there.  Today seems to be a bit warmer than other days. I was outside talking on the phone before and my new toy thermometer said it was 30 degrees. A little warm for me. And to think that only 5 years ago I used to LOVE it when I woke up and it was really really humid, and already 28 degrees heading onto 35... monsoooooooooooooon... lovely.. (but not anymore now I'm a MELBURNIAN!)  Later on today I'll head back to some of the beaches- and maybe even go for a bit of a swim. It will be the last time I get to swim in nice water (and stay in there for over 10 minutes!) until I come back up here again! Actually one more thing about my big long swim a couple of days ago- I put sun cream all over my face and body (SPF 30+ no less!)and generally it worked.... All except for the bit where my hairline meets my face, and just under the first few rows of hairs on my forehead as well- that has been burnt to a crisp.. It is so sore, and red, and starting to peel. It also looks absolutely ridiculous! Also, since I have been up here, I have gotten my freckles back on my face and my arms... and my body is a slight pinkish colour.... WHY CANT I JUST GET A TAN!?!?!?!?  Anyway enough for me for now, I have to get packing and get ready to head south to the farm for Grandmothers 90th!  Catchyas!

      Today brought with it another early start. This time it was not an alarm on my phone that woke me up, but rather my cat, which thought it would be very nice to sing to me at 5:40am. I love my cat, but I dont particularly want to hear it singing to me at that time of day. This is 'me' time, not listen to the cat meow time.  If it were cooler I would have slept with the windows shut, but it isnt cool at all (infact I am sweating now as I write this next to the window at 11pm!), so I have to make do....   Anyway, the reason I was up early was to go to Townsville. The main reason for this was for me to see my dad, who I have not seen in about 4 years I think. The reason for this is that he regularly works away from home, and due to the nature of our work (both his and mine), it is very difficult to align our holidays so that everyone has time off together. Last time I came up he was about 1000km west and could not make it up for the short time I was here. So this time, we made an effort to go up 200km north.  The trip up was pretty uneventful in itself. I slept for most of the way. I was awake though for a part when my sister, who was driving in the car infront of us, decided to overtake another vehicle just as someone was overtaking her. Like me, I imagine, she would have thought to herself "not dead yet" and thought nothing more of it. The other car was speeding quite fast though- that'll teach them to drive at over 200km per hour.  Anyway when we got to Townsville, we went to my sisters university dorm room, where she unpacked some of her things. She is returning back from a 6 week medical placement in Mackay, where she is in training to become a nurse as part of a nursing degree. Weird thing about our family, my mother is a nurse, as is an aunt of mine, and a cousin as well.  Once she had put everything in her room, my sister joined my mother and I for a trip to see dad. It was good seeing him again. Because it had been so long I had almost forgotten what he had looked like. It was obvious he was glad to see me as well, so that was all good. Unfortunately, we did not spend as long with him as I would have liked. We were only there for a couple of hours and then it was off to Stockland shopping centre, where mum and sister had to buy a few things. Before I left though, dad gave me one of his Phantom comics (I had almost forgotten I was mad about the Phantom as a child, as I was with donald duck comics, garfield (who is still a faveourite of mine!) and archie...) and he also gave me one of his work watches. I really appreciated that.  70 million photoes later, we were in Stockland. I left mum and sister early to go shopping on my own. I went looking for clothing shops, and was generally dissapointed by what I found. Well, I should have expected this to be the case. Coming from Melbourne- 'fashion capital' of Australia (yup even guys with almost no fashion sense at all know that Melbourne is the centre of it all), Townsville really had little to offer in this area. Even the Colarado shop there had a really dissapointing range of clothing. I was hoping to get some things there that they do not sell in Victoria (I heard that these shops have different ranges for different climates)- but I expect that Townsville just got the summer stock that Melbourne could not sell.  I ended up in a surfwear shop- Citybeach. This is the last place I would normally go into- as I feel I have outgrown it. However, I was drawm to their accessories range. They had these necklaces made of coral/shell pieces that looked really nice. I was split between two styles- one of them was plain white, and the other was a mix of white, with metallic blue beads.... I went for the one with metallic blue and white- as I felt plain white was just... well... plain boring! I think the necklace just says to everyone 'tropical lad'.... which is really how I feel at the moment. (shh dont tell anyone!!!)  Anyway after that it was off to my sisters dorm room again. I helped bring more things into the unit, and then I collected some fish with her to bring back to her unit. (she has pet fish). Then I installed some programs to her PC.. among them window washer and spy sweeper. We found about 56 spyware programs, and also we cleared more than a gigabyte of internet history cache files from her computer. As she has a cd burner on her pc as well (unlike this one)- I burnt the photoes from the islands and today to the cd.  Once this was done- it was back outside (where it had reached a scorching 28 degrees... well not scorching, but it was really uncomfortable!) and i gave my sister a hug before my mum and I went back to Bowen.   From there, we watched the news, funniest home videos, and then had dinner while watching Mad TV. For dinner was pancakes, with maple syrup and strawberries. yum yum yum yum  I then watched the bill, then went outside with the cats for a fair while (as it is still hot inside- and by that I mean 25 degrees or so) before coming here to write this. In a short while, I will go watch New Zealand News Week on sky.  My thought for today- how come all the news (and literally this was THE news story of the day) was devoted to an ex-realestate agent from Hobart- aka Mary Donaldson? Ok ok I guess I am jealous (it should have been me marrying a roal and getting all the ATTENTION!!!) but yeah- they showed it live, they are showing 2 re runs, as well as a cable channel running a loop of the entire wedding all weekend- you would think if we wanted to see 15 minutes of this wedding we would watch those shows/channels. Oh well.. good on her anyway..  Oh one more comment/thought for today- I was in Lowes today (ultra low market mensware store) when I saw a tatty tatty version of a really nice tie I spotted in Myer a few weeks ago in Melbourne. It is a nice one with like a bold outline of daisies on it... I want to get the real thing. After looking at the fake- I know for sure that fakes just arent worth the cash savings.  Ok NZ news week is about to start- catchyas!

      Todays entry is going to be really easy.   Today I went to the beach, and stayed there for about 6 hours. I did absolutely nothing except float around in the ocean... warm warm water....  As I will be heading back to Melbourne in less than a week, I have been checking the web to see what there is to do for the week I have free when I return... the best site is thatsmelbourne.com.au.... there are so many things going on next week... I think I will check out the festival of unpopular culture- should be interesting! I am into things like stencil art and that... so yeah.. am looking forward to it.  Nothing else to write about today- am having a wonderful time!  Catchyas

      No, it is not some weird porno subject- but rather the name of a ferry/cruise company that operates in the Whitsunday area. Today was an even better day than yesterday, clear clear skies and no wind at all. Perfect for a day trip through the islands. (Which, co-incidentally, is exactly what I did today!)  I got up at 6am, rather bleary eyed after not being able to go to sleep last night due to the heat. (It only got down to 15 last night here- hotter than the average SUMMER minimum in Melbourne!!!) It was nice to get up at this time for a change though and have it bright and sunny. This time of year- Bowen has about 1.5 hours more of sunshine per day than Melbourne (of course this is reversed in Summer, and enhanced by our daylight savings which Queensland does not have)  After a coffee and a shower, it was off to Shute Harbour- launching point for most ferries and cruises in the area. First up was Long Island. There did not seem to be much to do there. It was very quiet and laid back. The food seemed prohibitively expensive though, $5.60 for a normal packet of Pringles, and also $6.50 for a small (100mL) bottle of orange juice and some toast (with no spread!). I did like it though, as I imagine I would like to just relax and do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING if I were to be an overnight guest at one of these islands.  Next stop was Daydream Island (also known as West Molle.) This place certainly has improved quite a bit since the last time I was here (which was about 7 years ago when I was still living here!) The food and drinks were reasonably priced with no noticeable 'island markup' to the prices. They had a fairly miserable coral pond- which they claimed to be the second biggest in the world. Either they are lying or there are some pretty cramped fish in some coral pond out there. I do not think I would enjoy staying there. It is nice- don't get me wrong about that, but it is not my style.  Anyway after that, we went to Hamilton Island. This apparently is the biggest island resort in the South Pacific- which is not hard really when you realise there is not much competition. Hamilton was a lot smaller than I had originally imagined. I thought there would be a lot more high-rises, so was mildly disappointed by that. I got on a tour (bus) of the island. I was surprised to learn that just 16 years ago the entire island was just a cattle farm. Anyway a sight that worried me was the roofs of one of the highrises- you could see where some of the roofing tiles had fallen down to the ground below. I only hope that this happened during a cyclone and not when there would have been people down below!  Back to the bus tour- we went to the top of some hill, the views from there were amazing. I took several photos. Then it was back to the resort part of the island (everything is within walking distance here!) where I walked out to the beach and waded in some water. The water here is amazingly shallow for this part of the world, and also amazingly hot. I mean I would expect the water to be warmer than in Melbourne, but it seriously felt like it was as hot as a very warm bath- bordering on hot! I know the general water temperature at the moment here is about 24 degrees, however due to the shallow water and highly reflective sand- it probably was much hotter than that here. Nevermind- I still took lots of photos.  AFTER THAT- it was back to Shute Harbour. The catamarans were very smooth and on time- a double plus. The water in the morning was even glassy in appearance. So much so that on the way out of Shute Harbour I saw a shark under the water eating something that resembled a seal... but it could not have been a seal (I think) because they don't live this far north... whatever it was eating- it was enough to put me off going in the water for a full on swim for the entire day! (well that and the fact I left my towel at home!)  Towards the end of the day it got really muggy and humid- due to there being no breeze. I am so glad I came now (when everyone else is complaining about the COLD weather up here) instead of summer- I would have died or something.... it was just SO HOT!!! but yeah- i still had a great time all the same  When I got home, I just transferred some files from my digicam and sent them via email to Melbourne. I also called my father to wish him a happy birthday. (I think he is 53??)  And with that, I am going to bed, slightly sunburned, extremely tired, and a little upset that my tropical holiday ends in less than a week.  Catchyas.

      This morning I woke up and the first thing I saw was a clear blue sky. The first thing I felt was a nice cool breeze flowing over me. I am starting to like it up here!   First thing I did when I got up, was go out and have a coffee, after of course, I had complained yet again about how hot it was. (well it was 25 degrees, and somehow the heat just hit me as soon as I got out of bed... weird that ;p)  Mum took me for a bit of tour around town, we went out to a new housing estate with spectacular views of the bay and islands- I could not believe that some of the house and land packages were going for $200K. Places are worth more than twice that much where I am from, and I do not even live right on the beach (anymore)...  Anyway after that new estate, we went to Flagstaff hill, where there is a new restaurant/lookout thing at the top. Very expensive food, but a great view. I took some pics from the lookout and then it was off to Horshoe Bay.  If you ever come to Bowen you MUST come to Horshoe bay. It is just spectacular. I went into the water for a bit of a swim, and got as far as my navel, and decided it was too cold to go any further. Similar to when I go to the beach in Melbourne, I got a rush to the head and thought I was about to faint. So I went to get out of the ocean, then decided to go back in again. This time is was much nicer, and I dove in and swam about for about an hour or so. It was heaven. The water was so warm, I felt like I was sweating in it. And that was when I was just floating on my back!  I eventually dragged myself out of the water, and proceeded to go up the lookout. I took some pics up there as well, a great view from up there, even if the walk up was exhausting- due to the heat of course!  After that, we went to Woolworths (called Safeway in Victoria/Melbourne). I was served by a girl who seemed to know me, but I had no idea who the hell she was. So I just pretended to know her and talk about my life as if I knew her. I felt very weird about asking who she was- so I didn't. Oh well.   For lunch, I went to Jochiems again and got 2 sausage rolls and an apple turnover, with a trifle for later on. Their sausage rolls are DELICIOUS! yum yum yum yum. Sorry Melbourne, but no one does pastries like these guys!  In the afternoon, we went and booked a couple of tickets for a 3 island whitsunday cruise. Hopefully this weather holds up and it will be a great day.   For dinner, we went and got fish and chips- REAL fish and chips. I had coral trout I think and also some spanish mackeral, nicely crumbed and grilled, with some chips. DELICIOUS. I'm afraid this is another area where Melbourne does not measure up. All they seem to have available in fish and chips shops there is flake (shark). Boring.  Anyway I am looking forward to tomorrow, and trying to fit in as much as possible into my 6 days that I have up here. Even less than that if you count the fact I plan on spending Saturday night in Townsville.  Got to go to bed in preparation for my island cruise tomorrow- catchyas!

      This morning I got up and packed my things and got ready to go to the airport. I had Kelly drop me off a lot earlier than necessary (she did not know this) because I could not wait to get out of there. I also needed time to get some munchies- as by this time I was feeling more than a little hungry from not eating anything for the past day or so.   The flight up from Brisbane to Proserpine airport was really good. Just as I was leaving Brisbane, I could see the rivers of sand under the water- all beautiful colours of blue, and a little further out, a big sandy island, and beyond that, impressive storm clouds. Oddly enough, when I was on the ground, I could not see any clouds at all, but as soon as we were in the air, there they were, almost in your face.   I had a little bit of a treat on the take off as well; we flew right over the city centre. I had not flown there before so it was really good to see places where I had once lived and once hung out at, albeit from a great distance.   I landed pretty much on time and made a bit of a fool of myself. As I was coming through the airport, I was looking at someone through the (highly reflective) windows- and I was smiling at them thinking it was my mum, when infact it turned out to be a total stranger. So I kept on walking through the terminal and finally found her. I got my luggage off the back of the luggage truck. (This would have to be the most primitive airport ever- the luggage gets carted out in a truck!) Then I got in the car and went to Bowen.   It is really hot up here. It got to about 29 degrees today; meanwhile in Melbourne it was a nice 15 or so. I went straight to Jochiems pie shop- they have the yummiest pies, and I got a meat pie and cream horn. Yum yum yum.  I got a call from Kelly soon after that, she was telling me how she and her personal trainer were friends again. Yesterday she called state office of where he works and told them (anonymously) how he drove her to suicide and how he is sleeping with all his clients…. Some people……  Anyway I then got home, ate my pie, and had a nap. It is hot here! When I got up, I had a heatwave headache. I only get these inconvenient headaches when the temperature is well over 40 degrees in Melbourne… maybe it is the humidity here? Anyway I had a lot to drink, had some dinner and watched countdown to Eurovision.   I find Eurovision fascinating, and it is a shame I will not be in Melbourne for it. There they have a big screen in the city where thousands of people sit down and watch the show. I was planning on going there this year but obviously now I am up here so can’t; however I will still be watching it on television though!  Then I watched the apprentice. I have already looked up on Google to see who will win. I can’t understand though why Sam has not already been eliminated yet. I don’t like him either and I agree with Donald- I think he will ruin a company or two in this lifetime!  By midnight, it is still over 25 degrees here. Welcome to the tropics. In Melbourne it is 5 degrees…. I think I would rather be up here, but I wish I would acclimatise a lot faster!  Anyway time to go to bed- catchyas!

      This morning I woke up to my last day in Victoria for about a week. It was sunny- not a cloud in the sky, and a cool 12 degrees…. I finished packing and then I was driven to the airport at Tullamarine. I had not been on the Western Ring Road before, so it was interesting to go through a whole new part of the city that I had never been to before.   Checking into the airport was easy, the queue was almost out the door, but I did not have to wait too long to get my ticket and through the security checks. The flight left on time, and for the first time ever- I was able to see my house (well- more like suburb) from the plane as we made our way up higher into the sunny Melbourne skies. The general suburban area where I live is much larger than I imagined it would be.   Anyway into the flight I saw snow for the first time, on the far away peaks. It really looked quite wonderful, and it is a shame that I did not bring a camera with me on the flight- I could have (and would have!) taken so many pictures of the snow!  The in flight entertainment was some travel show and also a new episode of Absolutely Fabulous. I am not sure if it was the mood I was in or what, but I did not find it funny at all. Such a shame, I used to really like that show.   For lunch, I got a bun with something in it that resembled chicken, lettuce and tomato, some cheese and crackers, and a chocolate. You gotta love Qantas service- you actually get food with your flight!  I arrived in Brisbane on time and immediately felt the heat. I got picked up by Kelly, the friend I am staying with tonight, and we went to Fortitude Valley in Brisbane, straight to Burlington Supermarket. There I got some of these salty plum lollies- which consists of  … I am not sure- I want to say toffee but I am not sure if this is right or not- it is what you get when you boil sugar and water… I think it is toffee anyway- and in the middle of it is a preserved plum seed- preserved in salt. The taste is quite unusual, but I like it- and in the end I got about 25 packets of the stuff to bring up for mum- she really likes them. I cannot find these anywhere in Melbourne- I have been to many Asian shops- I will have to keep looking!  Anyway after we went there I went to “Hit’n’Run”- a factory samples and seconds shop- and got a couple of new funky shirts. Really really nice! After that it was back to Kelly’s house.  For dinner, we had a very interesting interpretation of spaghetti bolognaise. She made the sauce with tomato paste, tomato soup, and curry powder. I did not end up eating much of it and went to bed hungry. I ended up sleeping in the same bed as Kelly- with her husband sleeping on the couch. I was a little uncomfortable in sleeping in the same bed as her- but hey it saved me $$$ at the hotel. I think I will stay in normal holiday accomodation next time- or take a direct flight to north queensland- as it is so inconvienient to have to stop over in brisbane.   I do not know how I managed to live in Brisbane for so long, (it was a little over 2 years that I was there) it is an absolute dump. The valley, where I used to live, is a dump as well. Well, I mean they have a couple of nice bars and shops, but they really need to do something about all the homeless people out in the streets. I dont have anything against homeless people- but the state government really needs to revisit its spending priorities and give some more to the disadvantaged in the community.  Brisbane- just don’t bother, Melbourne is so much better!  See yas

      Tomorrow I go away on holidays to Queensland for a week or so to see family again. I expect it to be really hot and humid once I get up there- something I am not really looking forward to at all. I have just gotten used to the nice and cool Melbourne winter like weather. It has been cloudy all week and not hotter than 16 degrees since last Monday. Meanwhile I am expecting it to be in the high 20's up there and really sunny. I do not mind the sun so much, but I do mind the heat!  I only just packed everything away today- I am only taking shorts and t-shirts- anything else would be a bit silly. I will not be able to go out clubbing with the stuff I am taking up (no jeans and no proper shoes)- but then why would you want to go clubbing or anywhere else for that matter while you are up here? Clubs close at 5 in the morning and everyone seems to go out at about 9-10pm (in North Queensland). In Melbourne many clubs are open 24 hours over the weekend and people dont even THINK about going out until about midnight.... unless of course you are like me and go to dayclubs only- in that case you would get up in the morning like you normally would, and then go to some full on banging club... woo hoo!  Tonight I watched another episode of my restaurant rules- I quite like this show. I was dissapointed however by the fact that the couple I had been following (Brisbane) were eliminated in last nights vote. Oh well... I had planned to dine there tomorrow night but it seems now that this will not be happening. Well that and the fact that the person who I am going to stay with just told me she has only $2 to her name. How inconvienient.  Let me tell you a little more about this person who I am going to stay with overnight on my way up to North Queensland. She and I have been friends since we were about 9 I think. We are now (almost!) 24... Anyway I had lost touch with her after we finished school and one day when I was working as a checkout boy at Woolies Taigum, her mother came through my checkout and recognised me. I did not recognise her at first but that did not matter. I ended up giving her my phone number and she passed it onto my friend/her daughter and we got intouch again. Anyway at this time she was seeing another guy (we were never an item by the way) and then she got pregnant to him and had his baby, and then they got married... I was invited but could not make it up from Melbourne... Anyway I am going to stay with them tomorrow night, just a few days after she tells me that they are now separated but living together still. Effectively they are still married but they can see other people if they want to. Apparently he thinks he is gay. Fact is, she caught him before they were to get married with another guy, naked in a room together, with a bottle of lube on the bedside table.. yeah... I would think I were gay too if I found myself in that situation! They have been married for a little over 4 years now- I am amazed it has taken them so long to realise it was not going to work out- but again, it is inconvienient that they have decided to separate the week before I arrive to stay overnight. Oh, and did I say that her little brother lives with her as well? I am thinking I should budget to stay in a hotel overnight. Yuck.  One last night in Melbourne before I go away to Queensland.... in a way I do not want to go, Melbourne is such a fantastic place to be and quite frankly, Queensland is boring as hell, but then again, I have family up here and I will always come up and endure that what is Queensland for as long as they live here (which is likely to be forever!)  Got to get going- I have a flight tomorrow!!!  Catchyas

      This week, as most other weeks, has been rather uneventful. Certainly nothing has happened that has made me want to do a mid week entry in this blog.. so yeah....   Something I have noticed about winter in Melbourne is that this is the time of year when all those lovely little snails come out to slither across everything they find.   I have also noticed that they love to come out and play just before sunrise- when it is still dark. This time of day also happens to be when I start walking to the bus stop to start my daily journey to work. Each morning this week, I think I have stepped on at least three snails.   One morning, every step seemed to be accompanied by the crunch of a snails shell shattering under my shoes. I hate stepping on snails. I have not being able to see them in the darkness as I walk to the bus stop. I hate how they seem to congregate on the cement pavements- as if they were wanting to be stepped on.   The feeling I get when I step on a snail is one of creepiness, or something like it. It is disgusting. It is even worse to find that it is still attached to your shoe by the time you get to the train station.  In some areas close to here, the pavements are covered with the aftermath of previous encounters between people and snails.   Disgusting.  At least we do not get cockroaches running around over the pavements though in Melbourne. One thing I noticed while living in Brisbane was that at night, there seemed to be cockroaches everywhere- in the city, in the suburbs- all over the pavements were large brown cockroaches. I am yet to see a cockroach in Melbourne- and I have lived in a few suburbs in this city. I am sure they exist... in someone else’s home- but they are not things that run around the streets all night and day long. Thinking of the two- I would prefer to have encounters with snails than cockroaches. But again- I am getting a little off track!  Today I went to a couple of house auctions in the area. They were both double storey, one being 47sq and the other 40sq. The first one was passed in at $390K, and the other one at $360K.  I did not like the auction process much. In the second one, a guy made the first bid of $300K, and immediately upon that a vendor bid raised the price to $350K, and again to $360K.  To me, those houses were very overpriced, especially for the area, and also for what they were. The interior design seemed to me to be a waste of space. They did not utilise natural light very well, and the rooms seemed awkward in size and design.   seeing all the crap out there at the moment- I think I would be better off just building something- while at the same time having some input into the design and everything.   I do not agree with the practice of vendor bids at all though. Especially when they are so outrageously large like I saw today. Oh well, it will not be something I will have to worry about for a while yet!  The weather has been rather mild this past week- with no cold mornings at all. There has been a continuation of the sunny starts and cloudy rest of the days through this week, as there has been last week. On Friday, we had a day where we had a couple of cold fronts move through. In the morning it was extremely dark and grey, something I particularly like (but only when it is dramatically dark like it was Friday!). I was looking out at the cloudscape for the entire journey through to work, just because it was so different I suppose.   In the afternoon, another front came through, just as I was going to get my dry cleaning from the shop just up the road from work. I got caught in the rain and gales, and got soaked from the shins down. (A large umbrella protected the rest of me!). I had to go into the disabled toilets at work to use the hand drier and try and dry my jeans and socks. It did not really work, as they were still damp by the time I got home. (When I got home by the way, it was already 5 degrees.)   The clouds were so dark with this second front it looked as if it were night again. I could see the lights of the city, or rather; I could until the rain came through. I just love a good mid winter Melbourne cold front. Very dramatic and a nice change from the usual.  The weather over the weekend has been very nice as well. Quite warm today, 16 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. It was a good day to have someone come around and mow the lawn. Today we had Steve’s parents come around to mow the front and back lawns for us. They actually left the mower here when they were done with it. I guess it belongs here now or something.   The lawn looks a lot nicer now it has been mown for the first time since we moved in here in March. It has not needed a cutting since then because all through summer it was dead, and has only begun to come to life again with the help of the winter rains.    Talking of the winter rains (again!), I have noticed that on the other side of the train tracks, in Laverton West, there is all this surface water that has collected. I saw in the map that it was a wetland area over there, but I did not know how big it really was until I saw it from the train window the other day. Absolutely huge. It is amazing that there were no mosquitoes here in summer/autumn. Maybe it all dries up by the time summer comes. Judging by the state of our lawns in summer, I would think that it dries up completely well before then!  Anyway... what else has been happening here lately? I have put in for systems testing in Brisbane or Adelaide with work recently. If accepted, I get to go and work in a different state for a month, getting paid heaps of travel allowance and overtime. Getting accepted is like winning the lottery- there are so many applicants, all going for one of just 25 places or so. I have been once before and really enjoyed it, but we'll see about how I go trying to get in there again!  I should have been connected to Ozemail broadband this week, but they still have not gotten back to me at all. I might have to give them a call through the week to see what’s going on. We got leaflets in the letterbox through the week saying that Telstra is now offering broadband in the area for ADSL, which means, in theory, that I can go through any other provider I want now. Telstra only rejected my application a couple of months ago only because it was not available in this area when I last went to apply for it. Let’s hope that things change soon!  This week saw the re-introduction of Absolutely Fabulous onto our television screens. They are as funny as ever, but Joanna Lumley is finally showing her age. Poor thing. Dead ringers is back on as well, very clever show. Something that disturbed me when I saw it today though was that Changing Rooms apparently has a new presenter now… I wonder who it is. I hope they mean the Australian version and not the British one- I don’t want anything happening to my Carol!!!  Apart from this, I do not think I have anything else to write about today! Catchyas!

      Today is the winter solstice. I always like this more than the summer solstice, because on the 21st of June, you can look forward to the days getting longer, the days getting warmer, and things just getting better in general. On December 21st, it is the opposite. Even the hottest of the heatwaves are yet to come; there is a feeling of disappointment as the days get shorter, the sun peaks at lower angles each day, until the 21st of June, where it all begins again. Mid winter is not as bad as I remember it. I think I must be getting used to being a Melburnian. Sunrise at 7:38am is not really that bad. I must admit that getting up in the dark at 6am is a little unusual, but then again, I think I have gotten used to it now. Also, by the time I get home at 7:15pm, it is absolutely black outside. Indeed, today I noticed that by the time I got to the city at 6pm, it was absolutely black. I quite like that. The city is all lit up. The Rialto is glowing a nice blue colour. The flame things out the front of Crown Casino go off at 6pm, when I am on the Williamstown waiting to leave Flinders Street Station. I also really like looking at the flame show. Some of the puffs of fire look quite intimidating- balls of fire more than 5 storeys high, and a whole row of them going off at once- totally amazing. I like going from Flinders Street to Spencer Street Stations, on the overpass, overlooking the city and all the lights in the buildings. It is what living in a city is all about. People being busy all around you. Seeing the light shows of some of the high rise buildings, constantly changing colour- truly an amazing sight. In summer I would have to come to the city late- well after 10pm to see this spectacle. In winter- I get to see it every day on my way home from work. This is my favourite thing about winter. The early nights mean I get to see this spectacular light show every night. What’s even more spectacular though is going on the train between Newport and Seaholme stations, where you go right on the coastline, and you look out and see the lights of the city, from Port Melbourne stretching along the bay to Frankston, Mornington and beyond the horizon. I thought the view from Seaford beach was nice at night- the view from here is even better- and I don’t even have to leave the comfort of the train to see it. Also between these two stations, are the oil refineries. All the lights and steam and flames coming from this place are a sight to see as well. Some might think of this heavy industrial area as an eyesore- but I really like it. A mini version of the city- vertical rows of lights, fire, and a whole lot more pollution. Now I am all for saving the environment- and maybe I am a little unusual here- but I really like the smell of the oil refineries. Maybe I unconsciously get high on the fumes? Oh well.....  A thing about the weather here lately is that every morning, just after sunrise, all the clouds disappear and the sky is an amazing blue colour. Then mid morning, the clouds roll in and it stays cloudy until well after sunset. I don’t know why it does this every day, it is very annoying. I would prefer it stay sunny all day long so I can bask in the sunlight all day at work, but, it is not to be.  Speaking of work, it is still rather busy. I am coping better though- today I came in dressed semi casual. I might try it again tomorrow- I think by dressing casually, I feel more casual and relaxed- it's a good thing!  I notice I have become obsessed to an extent with big brother. And this from someone who was saying only a couple of months ago that they are totally over the concept of the show. Oh well- that's me- Mr Hypocrite.  What can I do- it’s what I'm best at! (Being a hypocrite that is!)  Hmmm... now that I have raved on and on about the winter solstice and how much I like travelling on the train home from work when it is absolutely dark and cold outside, I don’t think I have much more to say! I only really came onto the computer today to upload my other blog entries that have been banking up over the past week or so!  Catchyas!

      This week I have been at work everyday, having recovered from whatever it was that I had last week. It still feels as though I have a cold, but yeah, I do feel a lot better than I have lately! One thing is though that since I have returned to work, it seems that people around me seem to have gotten sick and are now stay home as well... perhaps I am still contagious! Oh well, it can't be said that I don't share things with other people!  Having gone back to work though, it is as busy as ever! Actually it has become so busy we have been instructed to ONLY take calls relating to the budget announcements from last month. Absolutely everything else has to be forwarded through to the local offices to deal with. To think that they were complaining of being understaffed BEFORE all this happened as well! I do not mind so much the new arrangements though- as it means we do less work and just do only the basics. The down side is though that the work is now totally non stop. I think I like it better when I am waiting for hours for a call to come through. I hope those days return soon!  The weather is now consistently cold. I cannot remember the last time I put on a t-shirt now. Everyday I just put on a jumper and trackies and socks.... which kind of makes me think that the shirts etc I bought a few weeks ago were kind of a waste of money. Oh well, summer will come around soon enough!  While I was in the shower this morning, I had a clever thought. When it gets hot, I will just walk to Aircraft station, get the train to Altona, and just walk the couple of blocks to the beach and laze about all day. Altona has kind of a resort feel to it (well the beach side of it does, the other side, is still 100% heavy industrial). I have never gone to the beach there before- I mean I have driven past it, but not actually gone into the water there or anything like that. I imagine the water would be quite a bit warmer up this end of the bay than it was where I used to live- where it would have been closer to the Southern Ocean. While I do actually quite like winter, I still also cannot wait for the days where I can have all the windows and doors open with nice warm breezes flowing through the house...   There has been continuing media commentary in regards to that free the refugees sign that Merlin had up on his big brother eviction show. In the letters and reports in the paper, everyone seems to be in support of his actions, which was very good to see. Some people even made the observation that the Queensland crowd were all just rednecks (an observation made as they all booed him when he made his statement). Queenslanders do have a reputation here for being rednecks, racists etc. From living there, and here, I guess I could say that they are rather less tolerant of those from diverse ethnic backgrounds than Victorians. However there are still a few racist Victorians about as well, which is a bit of a shame. It is their loss really, by not wanting to take advantage of all that diversity and multiculturalism has to offer. I say remove all the immigration quotas and let them all live in Melbourne! Probably would not work but oh well, it would make for an interesting change to the city!  I have noticed recently that there are houses still going up everywhere around here. It seems that entire neighbourhoods are being built overnight. It makes me question the building standards being used in the construction of these premises. Also, I think that most likely these places will look dated and old in a few years time. Not very good! Well, it is not all bad. Hopefully as this area gets more built out, there will be more public transport routes, and before long, hopefully a more direct route to the beach! (either that or I get my licence!)  I am not sure what else to put in this weeks entry! I no longer have time to update this everyday, so we are back again to weekly reporting!   Catchyas!

      It is now the middle of Queens Birthday long weekend. It is a bit strange that we celebrate this on a day that is firstly not the actual birthday of the queen, and secondly, that we celebrate this at all- given that the brits apparently do not have a public holiday for this occasion. I propose we all have a public holiday on my birthday in the future. Well, it suits me pretty much ok, will save me from taking RDO's on my birthday all the time in the future!  I woke up a little early again today, so I went out to get the paper, and parked myself on the carpet, under the central heating vent, in the sun, and put on the television. I was getting ready to watch one of my favourite shows, holiday, on BBC world. Amazingly, this show always brings me stories about places that I really would not mind going to. And every week after I see the latest episode- I say to myself that I would love to go to that place I saw on television just now. I actually only started watching this show because of Carol Smillie. I am a big fan of hers from Changing Rooms (UK). When I read on her website that she was presenting a show called holiday on the BBC- I just had to watch it. I was hooked and have been watching it ever since, even though Carol no longer hosts the show. (I still get my Carol fix from the UK changing rooms though!). Anyway back to this particular episode of Holiday from today.... When it started, the presenter was standing out the front of Federation Square, my favourite place in the entire city. I thought I was seeing things, but worked out that they really were in Melbourne. They were here recently too, as I could tell by the progress of a couple of high rise developments that were in the background. I learnt a little more about the city. For instance, I already knew that all of THE best places to go in Melbourne (bars, clubs, shops etc) are hidden away in the back alley ways- with no advertising and no signage out the front. The only way to find these places is either by accident/trial and error (which is how I find most of the places myself), or by word of mouth. Apparently though, some woman has gone and made a 'pack of cards' with the location details of 52 of these places. I am not so sure about this one- as I think it would make these secret bars and clubs too mainstream, but on the other hand, I would like to know how to get to some of these places too! I guess by keeping it secret though, you are ensuring that only a certain kind of person goes to each place. For example, you go to one of these bars, you like it, and you tell your friends to go etc... rather than getting people to go to places where they do not fit in or make others uncomfortable by being too dressed up/ not dressed up enough/ having the wrong attitude etc.... anyway after that they went down to the 12 apostles and the great ocean road, and then to some nice little B&B's a few hundred kilometres inland. It all looked really nice and as usual, made me want to go there as well. I wonder if these shows are made by the hotels purchasing advertising space with the BBC, or whether it is the BBC itself that seeks out the best of the best for its viewers... This will have to be something I look up in the future.   Through the day I was getting increasingly restless. It has now been a week that I had been sitting at home everyday, unable to do anything due to being very sick with a bad cold. I just had to get out and go for a walk- so I did. I managed to get down to the creek which is near to my house, and go for a short walk along the path. When I got there, I suddenly realised that there were some things there that would make good photograph subjects. So I then walked around looking for things to take photos of. I also checked to see if I could get any decent shots of the city. I found a couple of good vantage points, but I think these would look best first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon when the sun is reflecting off the glass buildings. I soon went back home, my flannelette shirt and trackies not enough to keep out the cold wind, even though it was still pretty sunny.   My cold? I am still sick, though nowhere near as bad as I was earlier in the week. It seems though that I have given whatever it is that I had to my partner, who is now suffering from the throat being on fire and bad sinuses. We can suffer together.... yay.  Later on in the night, I made some spaghetti bolognaise. I made the mistake though of putting too much tomato puree into the mix. Normally I only use tomato paste, pasta sauce and a secret ingredient with the mince, however this time I put in the puree. In the end it had the effect of just boiling the mince that had been pre cooked only minutes before. What a waste. In the end I called and ordered a lasagne and waited for it to come while I watched big brother.   Meanwhile what a shock tonight on big brother?!?!?!? Well, I am first of all glad that Merlin left the house. I am not sure that I could have handled watching him for another week. But yeah, when he was evicted, he jumped out of the car when he reached the stage. I thought that was a little odd... Then as he was walking down the catwalk thingo- he put black masking tape over his mouth and held up that sign that said "free the refugees".... By this time I was in shock, going 'oh my god I cant believe he is actually doing this'... Typically the producers tried to hide Merlin and the sign he was holding, which made it even more obvious that he was up to something. He then sat down and said nothing. He just stared out into the audience and said nothing at all, not even acknowledging Gretel at all. I have a lot more respect for him now, it would have taken a lot to actually go up there and make a statement like that in front of millions of people. The audience was booing him, and understandably so. It costs more than $100 to get good tickets to be in the live eviction audience. I would boo too if I felt I had been dudded out of my moneys worth. But I think he did it perfectly though. Just make your statement, and say no more. At least it will get people talking about the issue now! I also thought that Gretel was FABULOUS in her handling of the situation. She just went straight on with the show as if nothing was happening, and did not appear to be in the least flustered about it. Good on both of them. Another thing in tonight’s big brother is Miriam. Someone finally asked her if she was really a transsexual, and she said yes. A couple of the guys then had a fight over who was more of a man for having the balls to ask her first, but in the end they all accepted her and got on as though it didn’t matter at all. In the end it seemed as though Ryan had seen the show before (there’s something about Miriam), which is a shame. I still would have liked to see that idiot fall for her and get burnt. Miriam would have to be my favourite celebrity at the moment. She is on everything; she presented the channel ten weather a couple of times earlier this week and even helped present the news. I wonder if they will give her her own talk show.   Talking of talk shows, I am a fan of the Sharon Osbourne show at the moment. I stumbled upon it one day, and found it to very funny and entertaining. I think the key to that show is that Sharon is herself on it... and yeah.. I was a fan of hers when she was on the Osborne’s... and now she has her own show.... (I am getting no where with this one am I!!)  I have not had a shave for over a week. I have quite thin facial hair. I am thinking of letting it grow longer. I want to see how long it takes for me to get a full beard and moustache. I actually think I look better this way, but then again I always think I look better AFTER I shave all my facial hair off. I think I will just leave it until I can't stand it anymore!  Tomorrow is yet another day off for me. Queens birthday Monday. I had so much planned for this weekend, and in the end, it amounted to nothing, all because I am still sick. I am a little annoyed about all this, but really, what can you do. The next public holiday here is not until Melbourne Cup. That means no break from the bleak winter/spring weather (as in having the time to go somewhere warmer) until daylight savings comes back into effect in November. Incidentally, November is when I next have holidays booked from work. I am not sure as to what I will do for this week. If the weather is nice I would like to be able to go to the races (Melbourne Cup and Oaks day).

      Well, I was right last night in thinking it would be another cold morning. It got down to 0.6 degrees last night. I am finding it very unusual for it to be so cold, so early in June. Like I mentioned before, it normally does not get this cold until August. I dread to think how much colder it will get out here. And to think I thought Seaford was cold!!! Despite the cold start, it was not a very sunny day. Quite a bit of mid level cloud made the day somewhat miserable and dreary, and cool.  I woke up in a pretty foul mood though. I think it is those night time cold and flu tablets I took. They definately made me sleepy, but I got up at 5am and took a couple more of them, as the ones from the night before were starting to wear off. I should not have done this so close to my normal getting up time. By 9am, I was up again, still heavily tired though from the tablets I took a few hours beforehand. I decided to take 2 daytime tablets to wake myself up and get out of the 'tiredness' bad mood I was in. It was a weird feeling, as I could feel the effects of both tablets competing in my body. In the end I just felt crap, but I didnt have a runny nose or congested sinuses! I have resigned myself to the fact that I may have one of those horrible winter colds that last for a number of weeks. I hope not, but the longer this takes to get over, the more likely it seems.  It stayed cold for most of the day, so I went and had another one of my long hot baths. I hooked up my cd walkman to a set of small speakers and had my own little rave party in my head.... or something like that! While I was sitting in there I remembered that for ages I had been wanting to put in my blog my favourite songs at the moment... for no particular reason I suppose. Perhaps you can analyze the songs to work out my personality (as if this blog didnt help enough in that endeavour!), or perhaps you are stuck for songs to steal off the internet? Anyway here they are... in no particular order!   Push- strange world 2001 and the legacy (remixes of both of them I think)- both very trancey songs- to me perfect examples of hard trance.. but more on the trancey side of things.... I could (and have) listen to these songs every day for months!  Britney Spears- everytime (above and beyond remix)- I am DEFINATELY NOT generally a fan of britney- but this particular remix is really quite fantastic  George Michael- Flawless (go to the city)- again- this is the very first song from George that I have even remotely liked. I saw this on top of the pops last weekend on UKTV, and have not been able to get the song out of my head since. OK, it is just the original flawless (by the ones) with George just singing over it, but still, he does it... er.. flawlessly! and I love it! Very smooth, and I think, for me, this is a very melbourne song as well. Sexy, smooth, funky, hip, all those things... heheh  JX- restless (guyever remix)- i first heard this on JOYFM (i should say i came across this station by accident! i heard techno and left it there until i found out that joy likes its techno too!), months ago, and only downloaded it recently. It was my favourite song during my recent holidays, and I still really like this one a lot as well. Very dancey, it makes me almost want to get up and start raving about on the train to work! I have not heard any of the other remixes, but I think this one is the hardest from what I have read.  Thats all for songs for now anyway. Through the night I recieved several calls from people who were at the Justin Timberlake concert in Melbourne tonight. It sounded good, and it also sounded like there were millions of pre teen girls there as well. Could they scream any louder????  Apart from that, nothing else was happening today. I am getting bored of sitting at home all day every day just being sick. Not good at all. Oh well.....  Catchyas

      As I have all through the week, I got up early, called work, and read the paper. I was again, feeling better than I was yesterday, but still not well enough to go to work. I had actually ironed some clothes last night for going to work in today, but I got up at 6am, felt that I was still sick, and went back to bed again for a bit of a nap.  I got up soon after, and got dressed to go to the shops. I needed to get some more medicine, some stuff that dries up runny noses and that, and also some night time ones as well. I got a bus to coles. While on the bus, I noticed that quite a few people in this area have cats. There were several cats sitting on their window sills sunning themselves. It was a cold morning, down to 2 last night. By now it was still only about 6 degrees. Seeing all those cats in the windows made me want to go out and get one for myself. It wont happen though anytime soon, for the reason that I currently would have no time for one of my own!   Going on the short trip to coles, I was suprised to see how foggy it was getting in this area. Where I live, the fog had lifted a while ago, but the further in we went, the foggier it got. By the time I got to coles (not more than 2 miles away), I could no longer see the sun. I could not even see the shopping centre from the road, and that is a distance of less than 50 metres! I made my way to the chemist and got a pack of 50 sinutabs, and a pack of 24 something else (I forget the name!) which were for night time use. I then went to a $2 shop to get a few things. Insence, oils, some cheap CK underwear (factory seconds, but who cares!), and some other things too. I ended up spending over $30 in there. Not such a bargain basement place afterall, but oh well.  Then it was off to coles, where I got some essentials, like bread rolls, burgers, bread and other things. On the way out I went to the newsagent where I got some magazines on photoshop and broadband. I think I will have to call and change my ADSL connection request after reading some of the articles in that magazine, but thats another story.  By the time I got home, the fog had lifted, and it was an absolutely clear blue sky out there. No wind, perfect.   I did not do much for the remainder of the day, except sit in the sunlight (indoors!). By the time it was sunset, it was already under 10 degrees. With it being still clear outside, it was obvious that tonight was going to be a cold one. By the time I went to bed at around 10-ish, it was already down to 3.  I watched the big brother special, where Miriam went into the house as "Maria". I was hoping that Ryan would fall for her, except that he picked out that she was a man within about 5 minutes. All my evil thoughts dashed. Bugger. I think though towards the end of the live special, the other housemates had (incorrectly) convinced him that 'Maria' was really a chick. I will try and record the up late episode tonight to see what happens next....

      One of the things that sticks in my memory from yesterday is the array of Apple fan sites I came across yesterday. It seemed as though some people see Apple compters as some sort of sexual object. There it was, the apple logo, planted like a watermark, over the bodies of near naked women. I thought to myself- "this is appleporn"... I cannot imagine getting horny over an apple computer (or any inanimate object for that matter!), yet it seems as though some people can't help themselves. Each to their own.... as they say!  I am feeling a lot better today. Very noticibly better actually. I found my sinutabs at the bottom of the medicine box so I had a couple of those. I will have to go to the chemist tomorrow though to get some more as I have now run out of them!   I did nothing much else today. It was a lot sunnier than yesterday, but not perfect. Ah well, a whole week off work, you would think I never went on holidays at all a couple of weeks ago!  absolutely nothing new here... catchyas

      Still sick. However, for some reason, I found myself awake at 6:30. I geuss I could not sleep because of the congested nose and general feeling of being unwell. I put the television on and watched some news, and a little bit of the weather channel. The forecast was for it to rain all day, with a couple of cold fronts coming through. I was looking forward to the rain. The clouds outside certainly looked impressive as well. Very dark and low. It looked even better in the time before sunrise. Just on sunrise, it started raining really heavily. It sounds loud falling onto our colourbond roof (to me it is a tin roof, but hey, theres no harm in calling it by its copyrighted name is there?)...   I had actually taken a night time cold and flu tablet. I really felt as though I needed to sleep some more after being awake more than half the night with this cold. I called work though before I went back to bed. I sounded awful, so was thankful not to have to speak to anyone directly. I got the voicemail of one of the managers, so I left a message and went back to bed.  A few hours later, I was again up and reading the newspaper. It was still raining, and it was a little windy. No chance for a sunning session on the couch today. Oh well, more blankets and television for me.  In the afternoon, I was on the internet looking at ideas for a new computer. I am undecided as to whether to jump in and get a mac this time as opposed to the pc. I think I have been caught up in the marketing of the apples- having seen them being used as props in most television shows now, and hearing everyone go on and on about them as well. They seem to be really expensive as well, some of the monitors (alone!) costing upwards of $3000. I will have to think about that one.  There was about 5 minutes of dim sunlight just before the sun went down, and before long, it started raining again. just as it had all day. There was a severe storm warning out this time, as the second front was a fair bit stronger than the first. (Un)fortunately, we did not get much out of the second one though. Not much wind, just a couple of hours of rainfall. Nothing too heavy either, just normal for Melbourne. (However, compared to north Queensland rainfall, it was really very light...). There were just a couple of flashes of lightening here as well. On average, there are only 10 "thunder days" a year in Melbourne. I would have to agree with that, compared ot where I grew up in Queensland, there are very few thunderstorms here in Melbourne. Anyway, back to this second front, I found out later on that there was a small tornado that came from it, which went through some of the south eastern suburbs (in the Noble Park area). Quite a bit of damage etc- not very nice. I guess it is not so bad afterall to have missed out on the most 'exciting' parts of the cold front!  By evening, I was starting to feel marginally better. Then again, I always do feel better after laying in a hot bath for an hour or so when I am sick. I still have not gone to see a doctor yet. I could not think of anything worse than having to LEAVE my house, SIT FOR AGES in a doctors surgery with hundreds of screaming and sick kids running around everywhere, ONLY to be told that I ONLY have a cold and that there is NOTHING he can do for me. I am better off staying home.  Anyway that's all for today- catchyas!

      Today I woke up sounding like Madge from neighbours. I took the initiative to call in sick as soon as I woke up in the morning (about 9am-ish) because this is when a sick voice sounds its worst. And anyway- I really was too sick to go into work today.  I had my morning coffee and read the paper. I then watched a bit of television, sunning myself on the lounge. Before long I was bored of the television so I went outside to check up on the bulbs and just to get outside. It is very warm for this time of year. It got to 21 both yesterday and today. It will not last for long though, I am sure it will get very chilly in the near future as winter draws on. Actually just on the news- today was the warmest June day in 3 years. So there you go! It was very nice to be outside today actually. Nice blue skies, the sun was not harsh at all, and a nice dry northerly wind. Also today for the first time since I can remember, I smelt the smell of cut grass. Someone nearby was mowing their lawn, and it was a very nice smell. One of these days I should get around to mowing my own lawn here. But I really cannot be bothered and I think it will all die off again anyway by the time summer comes around.   After sitting outside for a bit, I had a nice warm bath. I must have been in there for an hour because I had to top up the bath with hot water a couple of times and quite a few songs played on my cd that I had set up in the bathroom as well. I felt refreshed after the bath, but still sick, with a stuffy nose and all that crap.  I was watching some more television, when I remembered that the transit of Venus is actually on today. I went outside to look at it, but as predicted, the glare of the sun was too bright to look at it directly. I tried to be tricky and tried to use a CD to reflect the sunlight onto a window so I can look at the reflection and hopefully see Venus that way. It did not work. I then went onto the internet to check out the live web cams that were being set up by the CSIRO. I looked it up, only to find it was cloudy in Canberra today. How inconvenient. I then went into some overseas sites and checked out the live web cam on those. I then had a thought- that perhaps a channel had been dedicated to this event on sky news. I was right, there was a channel showing the transit of Venus live. Although, in its news active mode- the screen is really really tiny, only a third of the total television screen space. What a waste. I will complain about that one day when I can be bothered to do so. Anyway I watched a bit of that, only to be disappointed that it was just a loop of the same commentary going over and over again. Not very nice, but still interesting all the same.   I got a SMS from Connex later on in the day telling me that my connecting train home was cancelled today. I am very glad that I did not go to work today. This is a bit of a weird co-incidence as well. The two times that one of my trains that I take have been cancelled- have been on days where I was sick and unable to go to work anyway. I suppose that’s kind of a good thing. It is not so good though for those people who catch a bus that connects with that train at Laverton. Buses stop operating very early here (at about 7-ish). I will have to send in a letter and complain about that as well one day.  I do not think I will be going to work tomorrow. My throat is still sore and my nose is just too runny. I will not bother going to the doctors either, as I have not been asked to by work and I think they know anyway that I am rather unwell by my phone call earlier today where I did that Madge impersonation.   I am very annoyed that the bill is not going to be on TV tonight. Instead there will be some silly ballet on the ABC. I suppose one good thing about this is that I will be able to watch the final episode of there’s something about Miriam tonight. Then I will watch her go into the big brother house on Friday. That will be interesting- especially as all the guys in there seem to be somewhat homophobic. I wonder what they will do when they find out she is a man. What if one of them falls for her? All for interesting viewing!  One other thing that I have been doing today is searching for a new ISP. Apparently broadband is now available in this area in a format other than satellite. I was very pleased to discover that prices have plummeted lately. 35 gigabytes for only $120 per month in some cases, and all that at 1500/512 speeds. Very impressive. I will have a bit more of a look around to see what’s available and yeah, hopefully I will be hooked up in less than a couple of months.  Nothing else for today  Catchyas!

      This morning when I got up I had a sore throat. I normally wake up with this sensation, which I normally attribute to my snoring through the night. I actually did not know that I snore through the night, until one of my flatmates in Brisbane told me so. It was then I was able to put two and two together and work out that it was my snoring that made me feel as though I had mild tonsillitis every morning when I woke up. Because of this, I decided I was good enough to go to work. And so I did.  Before I got to work though, I stopped off at Safeway to get a few essential items. Tissues, lemsip max, and Herron paracetamol. I was attracted to the area that was displaying the Lemsip max as these were a relatively new item. I have never before seen throat lozenges with anaesthetic in them before. Apparently they numb your throat and make you feel that little bit better. As it felt like my throat was on fire- I thought it was a good idea to buy some, and but some I did.  I got to work and had a couple of lozenges. They made my lips tingly, cheeks numb... but little for my throat. Though I must admit they allowed me to talk somewhat. I should not have been at work, but it was too late- I was there and really did not want to go home. Home is 2 hours away. Definitely not worth the bother at this stage.  Not too long into the morning, and a few people around me received emails from one of the managers, asking them to go to the office to talk about a chain email that was circulated late last week. A couple of people had asked me to go into the office with them to face the manager and try and help them out. If I haven't already told you yet, I am actually the union delegate for my workplace. I am getting a little conflicted in this role though, because the more I do it, the more I see that unions are actually quite weak. I have seen cases where apparently, the union was unwilling to assist its own workplace delegates when they got into trouble. This did not impress me much, and led me to think- what would they do for me if I ever needed their help? As well as this, my employer is not really that bad. Infact, I would go as far as to say the conditions there (and the salary) are as good as you would find anywhere in the public service, infact almost anywhere. It is very hard to be effective as a union delegate when you find yourself agreeing with most of what your employer is putting forward. On occasion, there have also been times where I am pro employer and anti union in regards to some of its viewpoints... example- my employer wants us to open six to seven days a week, and late night’s weekdays.... I am all for this- as I would love to sleep in everyday and come home late. This would be the perfect lifestyle for me. But the union, and some employees, are dead against it. I have never gone out on strike, and most likely never will. I think it is a waste of time and I would much rather be working than out in some rally somewhere. Strikes do not work either- the employer is better off by us going out on strike. Think of all the costs like electricity, phone calls, etc that the employer saves on by not having to pay for it because everyone is not there. On top of that- they also save on wages. I am a hypocrite, I stand as union delegate, but I am against most of what it stands for. I am contemplating not running in the delegate elections this year. Enterprise bargaining starts in a couple of months and I would rather not be involved in that process at all. Infact, I might just leave the union altogether. I am already paying the minimum rate payable just to remain financial. Come July one, I might just cancel my membership altogether. We'll see. In any case, I went in with the first of many people who were to be 'counselled' over the sending of a chain mail that promised huge amounts of money (paid by none other than Bill Gates) if they forwarded on this Microsoft related email. I got this letter from about six different people. I do not mind the occasional joke etc, but chain mails really set me off. I hate them. I hate them so much, I did the unthinkable (for a union rep!) and sent them all onto my manager. Everyone knows I loathe chain mails. They should have known better. Also, many people have recently been fired over sending naughty emails in my organisation. Mostly it was pornographic in nature, but in the aftermath, it was clearly stated that chain mails were not to be sent on our network. It could not have been more explicit. Anyway here I was going in to represent someone who is in trouble because I sent their email into the manager. So what, I am a dog, get over it. Lol. The end result was just a verbal warning and a record placed on her file for two years. Nothing too serious. After I came out of the managers’ office with this person, three other people came up to me and asked me to represent them later on through the day. I said if I was still here, I would be able to help them out.  As it turns out, by about midday I was too sick to go on. My throat was on fire. The anaesthetic lozenges were not working. I could not speak. I was feeling tired. It was time to go home.   The trip home was seamless. I get to my train station, and the train to the city pulls up immediately. I get on, and before I know it, I am in the city. Change platforms, and my connecting train is waiting to go. I get off out west, and what do you know, my bus is waiting to go as well. I could not have timed my departure from work better. I arrived home, had a wine (which turned out to be great for making my throat feel better!), and rang the tax office.  After that, I had some lunch- a salad roll with salsa chicken slices. Yummo. I think you can only get this salsa chicken from Coles, as I have not found it at Safeway yet. Anyway after that, I went and had a nap. I was very tired and sick by this time, however when I got up, I felt a bit worse than when I had gone to bed. I just love being sick. Not.   Later in the evening, I had some more red wine- which made me feel better again. I went and watched some big brother. I am glad that Merlin is up for nomination this week. He is such a sook. I cannot stand him being so non confrontational. I was upset that Ryan is not up though; I would like to get rid of him as well. As for last night’s eviction, I was surprised, but glad that Terri and Paul got to stay and extra week. They really entertain me.  I ended up staying up a bit late, but I was not too bothered- after all I am in no condition to go to work tomorrow. Mum called me briefly through the evening, and apart from that- that was my day!

Enterprise bargaining starts in a couple of months and I would rather not be involved in that process at all. Infact, I might just leave the union altogether. I am already paying the minimum rate payable just to remain financial. Come July one, I might just cancel my membership altogether. We'll see. In any case, I went in with the first of many people who were to be 'counselled' over the sending of a chain mail that promised huge amounts of money (paid by none other than Bill Gates) if they forwarded on this Microsoft related email. I got this letter from about six different people. I do not mind the occasional joke etc, but chain mails really set me off. I hate them. I hate them so much, I did the unthinkable (for a union rep!) and sent them all onto my manager. Everyone knows I loathe chain mails. They should have known better. Also, many people have recently been fired over sending naughty emails in my organisation. Mostly it was pornographic in nature, but in the aftermath, it was clearly stated that chain mails were not to be sent on our network. It could not have been more explicit. Anyway here I was going in to represent someone who is in trouble because I sent their email into the manager. So what, I am a dog, get over it. Lol. The end result was just a verbal warning and a record placed on her file for two years. Nothing too serious. After I came out of the managers’ office with this person, three other people came up to me and asked me to represent them later on through the day. I said if I was still here, I would be able to help them out.  As it turns out, by about midday I was too sick to go on. My throat was on fire. The anaesthetic lozenges were not working. I could not speak. I was feeling tired. It was time to go home.   The trip home was seamless. I get to my train station, and the train to the city pulls up immediately. I get on, and before I know it, I am in the city. Change platforms, and my connecting train is waiting to go. I get off out west, and what do you know, my bus is waiting to go as well. I could not have timed my departure from work better. I arrived home, had a wine (which turned out to be great for making my throat feel better!), and rang the tax office.  After that, I had some lunch- a salad roll with salsa chicken slices. Yummo. I think you can only get this salsa chicken from Coles, as I have not found it at Safeway yet. Anyway after that, I went and had a nap. I was very tired and sick by this time, however when I got up, I felt a bit worse than when I had gone to bed. I just love being sick. Not.   Later in the evening, I had some more red wine- which made me feel better again. I went and watched some big brother. I am glad that Merlin is up for nomination this week. He is such a sook. I cannot stand him being so non confrontational. I was upset that Ryan is not up though; I would like to get rid of him as well. As for last night’s eviction, I was surprised, but glad that Terri and Paul got to stay and extra week. They really entertain me.  I ended up staying up a bit late, but I was not too bothered- after all I am in no condition to go to work tomorrow. Mum called me briefly through the evening, and apart from that- that was my day!

      It got down to zero degrees last night, which is suprising as it is still only the first week of winter. Normally it does not get this cold until August or September. Then again, I am living out west now and it is common knowledge that it gets both hotter and colder here than most other parts of the city. The cold weather last night would explain why I woke up early in the morning feeling cold. It is a rather uncomfortable sensation, being woken up from the cold. I generally deal with it though by just going back to sleep. Probably not the most health conscious way to deal with the problem, but hey, its me and I am generally too lazy to do anything much about... well.. anything!  When I did get out of bed, I went and had a coffee, but before too long, I was back in bed, this time from still being tired. A couple of winters ago I would try and avoid napping during the day at all costs. I had this feeling that the days were way too short as they were and I could not afford to miss any of it by wasting time sleeping. I think I am over that phase now (either that or it hasn't reappeared again for this winter yet). Anyway I napped for one hour, getting up just in time for Martha. I did not watch much of it though, so instead I read my newspaper and had some baked beans on toast. Yummo.  After that, I went outside and took some more photos of things. I have already run out of things to take photos of. I resorted in the end to taking pictures of fruit, would garden hose, and a shirt button. I tried to make them artistic by using the macro setting and focussing on them close up. I think they look good, but yeah, I have run out of subject matter I think... well I have in my garden anyway!  I think I am getting a sore throat again. Well, it has been scratchy all day, and slowly is getting worse. How inconvenient.  I caught up on some old television today as well. I have been recording some shows that are on when I am just too tired to watch them. I watched the Glasshouse from last night, and I also watched double the fist. I like the first show, but thought the second one was an absolute load of shit. I do not get it at all. Then again, it was made in Sydney so what do you expect lol. I don't think you would ever find a bunch of bogans like that here in victoria.  In the paper today was more on that police corruption scandal. I think the premier is a fuckwit. I have said it before, but reading what he isnt doing in regards to police corruption is disgusting. Also reading about how the unions (which are the biggest donator of funds to his political party) are allegedly involved in underworld crimes etc.... does not do much for ones confidence in the system. Bring back Kennett. YAY!!!  Did I tell you I moved to victoria because Kennett was premier? It seemed like a good idea at the time. Only thing is that fuckwit Bracks won office just a few months before I came down. How pissed off was I. Anyway I could go on and on about Kennett but I won't, but I will have to find a Kennett fan site out there to link to my blog for all of you to look at. There has to be some sad person out there who has made a fan site of this guy.... everyone has a fan site... I bet some obsessive weirdo has one about me out there somewhere! heheh  I dont think I have that much more to add, so I will leave it here for today.  Catchyas!

      Today was a nice day to sleep in. It had gotten foggy overnight and the day time turned out to be a really cloudy affair. I read my newspaper, and before I knew it, Martha Stewart living came on. They had a piece on owning birds and what sort of diet should be given to them. I would like to get a bird, a budgie or something. I think we will eventually get a pet bird for this house. However Steve (the other one!) wants to get a parrot. I don't want a bird quite that big, so I think we will have to look around and find something that suits both our needs. I am rarely home though, so I would be happy to get something larger this time around I suppose.  A little more reading of the paper, a little more sitting in the sunlight, and it was time for New Zealand News week. We watch this show every week. It is one of my favourites. I would love it if the culture of the New Zealand people (as portrayed via 3 news) was the culture of the Australian people. They should invade Australia and make it just another one of its parts. Go Helen!!!  After this it was time to go to Coles. We were out of milk and almost out of La Ice. I got 8 x 2.25 litre bottles of La Ice, a 3L bottle of milk and some other things. I also decided to try a new kind of shampoo and conditioner- Dove brand. I read in Choice magazine that it was the most popular brand of shampoo and conditioner and a trial, so I thought I would give it a go. I was very impressed with the results.   Anyway enough about shampoo and shopping. After this, I got out the digital camera and took some pics of things in the garden. I only just discovered the macro setting, so I went out and took photos of things close-up. I was extremely happy with the results, and will have to include them on any future website I put together for myself.   I spent the rest of the day lazing about watching television. I had all intentions of going into the city to watch the Olympic torch as it made its' way through the city again (we last had the Olympics here in 1956, and commonwealth games will be here next year)... but yeah, I could not be bothered to go and watch the flame. I saw it on the news anyway. How boring. Also, if I am at home, I can't be out shopping, spending more money than I really have.  One final thing, which I am not sure I have mentioned yet- is now I am fully acclimatised to the Melbourne weather again. I no longer feel cold to the bone anymore, which is a really good thing. Yay for being a Melburnian.

      Today I got my bus. I went to the stop especially early, and the bus came by even earlier than it did yesterday. It came by around 7:06am. I have a feeling the bus driver was less responsible for yesterday’s disaster than I first thought.  My paper came today as well (before I had left for work). I was happy with this as well. As I got the bus to the train station, I had enough time to go to the newsagent and get a couple of magazines about digital imaging and photography. I think I will have to update my profile to show I am interested in digital photography. I was reading these magazines on the train and found them a lot more interesting than what I had first thought. They had reviews for digital cameras, and tips and stuff which taught me a lot more about printing pictures and taking shots than I had ever known before.  Work is still very busy. Before I went on holidays I had enough time to walk around chatting to people. Now there is absolutely no break at all from the work. It is non stop. This time of year is normally busy, but nothing like this.   When you work this hard, you deserve to have a bit of fun though. In my area, we have this stupid thing of making announcements regarding us having parties for all sorts of weird and wonderful reasons. Today we announced we were going to have a getting sick party for someone who is currently sick. We said we were going to put some fake vomit on their desk and also pictures of people throwing up on their walls. We are twisted. Later in the day, we decided we would like to have a graffiti party. We asked our supervisor (who happens to be heavily into hip hop and graffiti art etc) to bring some spray cans to work for our little party. We said we would use the cans to tag the walls and also to inhale the paint. You never know, the party could get a little out of hand and could develop into a chroming chill out session. Of course- all this talk of holding weird parties is in fun, and we would never be as weird as to actually hold a getting sick party for someone or a graffiti party (though the second one does somewhat appeal to me!). Other parties we decided would be nice to have were rivita parties- where we would have all the different kinds of ryvita on offer- the plain ones, the salted ones, the wholemeal ones..... we also would like to have a drug and alcohol party- but that’s another story altogether!  I moved onto lesson two in my German CD today. I printed off the text version of the lesson and read it on the trains and buses home. I am finding it a lot easier to learn now that I have the basic grammar structures under control.  On the train home, I found that two of my fellow workmates were getting the same train home as me tonight. I chatted with them and we got on the train together. It was the funniest ride home I have ever had. Again you will see why I think I am the most boring person alive lol.  After we took our seats near the front of the train (I have a very short transfer time between trains on the way home as well!) we looked over and noticed this guy reading a book. We also noticed his fly was totally undone, and open. Not just a little bit open, but I mean absolutely gaping open. We did not know where to look. We could not look at this guy, because we would be drawn to the open fly. It is like a car crash- you know you should not look, but at the same time, you can't help BUT look. We also could not look out the windows either, because his reflection would have been in it, along with everything else. So we just ended up laughing and giggling like little children for a couple of stations. We then stopped for a while so the train driver could let on a wheelchair passenger. One of the people with me on the train said that a really hot guy in a wheelchair was about to get on. This got me curious, and in my current state of mind, I thought anything was possible. When the guy eventually got on the train, he turned out to be really old with some sort of muscle disease.... I know it is really inappropriate to laugh at these people, and normally I wouldn't, but with the combination of the guy with the fly undone sitting across from us; the comment that a really hot guy was about to get on the train, along with seeing who actually did get on the train, was just too much for me. I burst out laughing, while at the same time trying to hold it all in. I had to hide my face behind my gloved hands and laughed as quietly as I could. I had never laughed so much before than at this combination of events. I then set off the other two, who also were laughing their heads off. We then chatted about stuff, all the while making references about that guys fly being undone. We were saying things like "he is going to FLY DOWN" all the time, with the obvious emphasis on the "flying down" parts in order to get his attention and take some action regarding his fly being undone. He got off at South Yarra station; fly still undone, when I noticed another feature of this man. He was wearing an open trench coat. I told the others that I had visions of this guy walking around with a closed trench coat- then all of a sudden flashing his open fly to anyone who was unfortunate enough to look at him at the time. The poor people on the Sandringham line would have no idea what hit them.  I got home, had some beef in plum sauce pizza (yummo!) and then watched some Mother and Son. This show is really funny. It is a shame that Ruth Cracknell has passed away, as I found her to be a brilliant actress. After that I watched gimmie gimmie gimmie, and recorded the rest (glasshouse and double the fist) as I was too tired for anymore television. Another weekend now awaits me! My first weekend since coming back from holidays.

      Today I got up, feeling a little worse than usual. I did not get enough sleep last night. How inconvenient. In the hour I have at home before I go to work, I normally go around putting things away so I come home to a neat house in the evening. Today though, I put away a few more things than usual, even venturing out to the recycling bin to get rid of some bottles that had been sitting under the sink for the past few days. Little did I know that this extra bit of housekeeping would lead to one of my worst fears being realised... (You will come to understand how boring I really am when you find out what happened next....)   I left the house a little after 7am, and I had a feeling I was running a little later than normal. A quick check of my watch shows that it was 7:08:32.... I am just a little bit later than normal, nothing bad can happen.... but all the same I started to jog to the bus stop. Just as I was about to get onto the street where the bus goes- I see it roaring past at full speed. I could not believe my eyes. It took a while to sink in that I had missed the bus and had no chance of getting it- or to work on time. I say this because I ran after it for a little bit in vain. I guess I thought I needed the exercise! On my walk back home, I called the Age. My newspaper had not been delivered yet again. However, on my walk/run to the bus stop, I had noticed all the Herald Suns had been delivered. Maybe they have something against age readers out here. People think only snobs read it, but I would not consider myself one of those. But at the same time, I could not bring myself to read that other paper, as I think it is just too sensationalist (everything is a drama or scandal in that paper)... so yeah.....  Anyway after confirming that I would be without a copy of today’s Age until I got back home from work, I asked if I could get a lift to the train station. It is not a good thing to wake someone up from a bad nights sleep to ask them to take you to the train station, but I did it all the same, and I got my ride in. I managed to get my train as normal, so that was ok. I was absolutely furious with the bus driver though for coming by early. (A check of the bus time table shows that the bus is meant to come by at 7:05, but it is always 5 minutes late.... so it *is* his fault for coming earlier than *normal* this time around...)-> nothing is ever my fault.  Without a copy of the age to read on the way to work, I got a window seat on the train. It really is not that bad not to have something to read on the commute to work. I normally sit right up the front of the train, where there are no windows. I don’t need to look out as I am reading all the way into the city. This is why I still find the scenery out here relatively new and interesting when I actually do decide to get a window seat into work.   I used to have this thing about sitting right up the front of a train. I have a belief that this is where everyone gets killed or injured if ever there is a train crash. I used to totally avoid sitting up the front, but since I moved out here, I really have no choice. There is a one minute space between the scheduled arrival of my train into the city and the departure of my connecting train. I often do the inter-platform sprint in order to catch my second train. This morning though there was no need. The previous connecting train before mine had been cancelled, and the one I normally get had been postponed. It was eventually cancelled as well, so I was going to be a little later than normal to work. All this and I still had to go to Safeway before work and get a can of soup and some milk for my coffee.  On the way in I noticed the Salt nightclub. I have never been there before, but have read all about it in the papers in regards to the stabbings and that sort of stuff that used to go on in there before it was shut down by the government. I was invited there once, but never ended up going there. I am not sure why I didn’t go, as I am sure I was invited before I stopped going out.... oh well.. guess it does not matter now because I am now too old and it has been closed down permanently.  I went in and got my tomato, vegetable and pasta soup, and some milk, and than ran up the road into work. I had gotten there on time. Yay.  The rest of the day was rather uneventful, work work work and no play.

      first of all i should state that this is the second time i am trying to write todays entry. i originally wrote it on another nearby computer, and went to put it on a floppy. only that floppy would not read on this computer and now i have lost all i wrote just a few minutes ago- so i think i might miss out a few things.... oh well here goes anyway  my day started rather well. while going over the geelong freeway on the overpass- i looked over to the city to see it with the clouds going all red and gold behind it. i love the shilouhette of the city at this time of year in the morning- it is really a beautiful thing to look at and really does make it worth getting up so early in the morning!  the trip to work was ok- i was not late in today so thats a plus. it was rather busy though, so again i had not much time to do anything other than what i am paid to do.  hmmm... this is so much harder to do when you are writing it for a second time! how inconvienient!  i have tomorrow off work as an RDO- i thought i would need a mini break from my sudden return to work- and i thought right. i am absolutely rooted. i could have chosen a nicer day to have off though- tomorrow is forecast to be rainy and windy- rather like today.  you can tell it is suddenly winter- it only got up to 13 degrees today and was cloudy all day long. the wind however was a very strong northerly- conditions like this in summer would lead to a temperature in the mid 40's... but no, it is winter, so we'll be lucky to get anything over 15 this week.  ummm... yeah.. i cant be rooted trying to re type my entry for today. i think i will revert to weekly blog posts at the very least- as i simply do not have the time for it to send this stuff from work. also i tried to do a blog entry from work to here- but it does not seem to have worked. oh well  thats all for now- catchyas!

        Yesterday I had an RDO. Nothing particularly exciting about that in itself, however my employer is notorious for not allowing staff to take Fridays off as an RDO.     The day started out nicely enough- I slept in until 10:15am- something of a rarity- and when I did eventually get up, it was a very bright, sunny morning. In a way I was a bit dissapointed that I did not get up earlier to enjoy more of this sunshine!       I decided that I was going to go out to the city today to buy a few things, however after I got to the train station, I called one of my buddies and realised that they were going to go to DFO today. I thought I may as well go along too, so instead of going to the city, I ended up going to DFO.   I bought a few things there- like a couple of pairs of shorts from Canterbury, a new bag, also from that same shop, and a jacket from roger david. I will return for that jacket from nautica next time!  By the time we had finished up in there, it had turned all grey and windy outside- a total change from the morning. It rained when I got to the train station out there and it continued to rain for the remainder of the night.   I got the train into the city, and I got off because I needed to go to Myer and use this gift voucher I got from work on my birthday a few months ago. I was going to buy a new tie, one that I saw there a month or two ago. To my dissapointment however, they no longer had the one I wanted... so I went and looked at other ties. I found nothing that I liked, and then all of a sudden, I realised that I had also been wanting some good quality white business shirts- and they were right next to the ties, so I ended up getting a new work shirt. Sounds pretty boring huh, but I am really glad that I got it, the quality is a lot better than everything else I have at the moment.   Anyway I finished up at Myer and went to get the train from Central Station. It was one train earlier than the one I normally get, so I thought I would get off at Footscray and get the bus that would normally take me home.   I sort of miscalculated the timetables though, because I got the bus that is the one AFTER the one that I would normally get from Aircraft station. I realised that when I saw my train pass infront of us just after Seaholme station.  &nbsp;  Oops.   At Altona, the driver got a little lost, so we ended up going along the esplanade- I did not mind so much, because I had no idea where we were either, I had never been in this area before, so I was happy to go along for the ride.   In the end I got to Laverton about 5 minutes after my connecting bus left, so I caught the train to Aircraft (there was no wait at all for the train!) and walked home, in the rain.   It was not as bad as you might think, it was not very windy, however it was 7 degrees and raining!       &nbsp;   I woke up today and found that I did not get a cold from walking around in the cold the previous night- which was a good thing! It was very cold today though- only getting up to 11 degrees, and it was rather windy for most of the day as well.     &nbsp;   I really had nothing much to do, except clean the house a little and do all the laundry. At around midday I went to the bus stop to go to Coles and get a few things. On my way back, I came across a landscape designers shopfront. They were having a sale, so I ended up purchasing 4 succulents which I placed in a shallow pot that until recently had been the home of some dying cactuses. The new plants look a lot nicer in their new home than the old occupants!     &nbsp;   I also went into a lolly shop, and got some eucalyptus lollies as well as some redskins and fizzoes- all the things I love to pig out on!     &nbsp;   I then went to the bus stop to wait for the bus- however it was so cold I decided to call for a taxi. I waited for half an hour- before the taxi company called me back saying that the driver could not find me. I guess it did not occur to the taxi driver that there could be more than one bus stop outside of the coles- as I was still sitting there in the cold wind- and could not see a taxi anywhere. I told them that I had waited so long the bus was almost here anyway- and cancelled my taxi order. Sure enough, the bus came not more than 5 minutes afterwards. I had gotten so cold in the meantime though that my ears were stinging- and I even had a beanie on and everything... oh well.     &nbsp;   Later in the afternoon- I went to have a nap because I was going over to visit George and Samantha- they had invited me to spend the night over there. However- half way through my nap- Jim and Angela come over with their kids. Jim had come around to fix up the television antenna which had been playing up recently.     &nbsp;   I am not a very nice person when I am tired- even at the best of times- but God help  anyone  who interrupts my afternoon naps. He said he had called me- however he never spoke to me to tell me he was bringing everyone around this afternoon. I also found out later on that someone else had told him that I was going to be asleep. He actually knew I would be sleeping and still turned up anyway! I was furious, and wasted no energy trying to hide it. While Jim was up in the roof fixing the antenna, I went into the bedroom and then into the office- staying far away from my *guests*. I wanted nothing to do with them at the time-  they had interrupted my afternoon nap!  My foul behaviour worked- they only stayed half an hour- which must be a record short stay by them at  any  house!     &nbsp;   I was picked up a couple of hours later by Samantha, where we bitched about people we know and chatted about others we know currently having a holiday in Bali (yes you know who you are!!!) :)     &nbsp;   She made up a nice roast which I ate, then I got into the peach wine. I did not get as drunk as I had expected- only 5 peach wines and 1 bourbon and coke... not much at all actually. However I felt really cold there (after spending the week in a house with the heating turned up to 26 degrees all the time-  ANYWHERE  else seems cold!) and yeah I think this was the reason for my not drinking much.     &nbsp;   Anyway we watched Shrek 2- I would not have thought that I would be into this kind of movie- however I must say I enjoyed it. The fairy godmother is a bitch. heheh. Then we watched Harry Potter three- which I found a little more interesting. By this time I was a little tipsy and was laughing at everything that really was not meant to be funny. I absolutely pissed myself laughing at the sight of that book of monsters forming teeth and chomping itself across the carpet! (or  was  that meant to be funny???)     &nbsp;   Anyway nothing much else happened today- so I guess it is time to go....     &nbsp;   catchyas     &nbsp;

      It is Thursday night and I have a bit of time spare- which is a bit unusual for me in the middle of the week!  In reality- the only reason I am on here tonight is because there is nothing on television at all. Well, Absolutely Fabulous is on- however I already have series 5 on DVD (on loan anyway) so I am just waiting for Dead Ringers to come on....  I sit here listening to the best radio station I have ever listened to in my entire life- Kiss FM London. They are heard here via streaming audio over the internet. It seems the stuff from London is a lot better than the crap they play in Melbourne. They are playing that Baby cakes song now... gotta love that UK Garage style....  You may be wondering why I have titled today’s entry 'trouble with buses'... or maybe not... well, the other night, the train was held up somewhere between Newport and Seaholme- and as a result, I missed my bus home. In the end I walked back home from Aircraft station. I had never walked between those two places before, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it takes as long for me to walk home as it does to get the bus. The bus out here goes all through the suburb in a winding crawl through the streets, whereas I can just walk straight along the creek and in to my door. It could not be easier. I think in summer I will walk home wherever I can- it just seems so much healthier. Also the next day, I felt really good as well from the exercise. Excellent.  Anyway it was a minor inconvenience that I missed the bus home that night, however the following morning, the bus actually broke down between my stop and the train station! I thought to myself that it seemed unbelievable that I could be having this run of luck with the buses- missing it one day, and being on a broken down one the next. I did not mind so much because I was meant to have gone to a meeting that day, but it was cancelled at the last minute so I did not have to be at work until half an hour later than usual.   After all that drama anyway, I got there (to work) 4 minutes early (or in other words, 45 minutes later than I would normally get there any other day).  It was not all bad though; because I missed the train I normally get into the city, I got to take the express train to the city. It is interesting to get the (one and only!) express train into the city into the morning, as it is the only one that does not go along the Altona line- instead, it goes direct along the old Werribee line from Laverton to Newport.   I would love to see the Werribee trains go direct along this route all the time, however I somehow don't think this is going to happen at all!  Anyway, back to yesterday, my workmates were not expecting me to come in at all, as I am normally there 9-ish after my stop off at Safeway when I get off the train. Their assumption that I would not be in turned out to be pretty entertaining!  Every weekend, I make some muffins to eat at work. It is a lot cheaper than buying them from the shop and generally they taste a lot better when I make them! Anyway I have these muffins sitting on my desk in a container- and yesterday morning, a couple of co-workers decided that they would help themselves to the muffins on my desk. (I had offered them some the day before- however they said they would have some later). Anyway they were in the kitchen microwaving the muffins when I come in and the chick who sits across from me just burst out laughing.... I asked her to tell my why, and she said that I would find out soon enough. I told her that I wanted to know straight away so I could play up on whatever it was that was funny and make the most of it... Play up on it I did....  She told me they took my muffins, thinking I was not going to be in at all. When the two culprits came in from the kitchen, their faces were struck with guilt. They were shocked. They were stunned. I decided at this moment to go all out and make them feel terrible for stealing my muffins. I yelled "who told you that you could have my muffins"... I went on and on, even went red in the face.... until I could keep it up no longer and burst out laughing. Everyone all around me burst out laughing as well- so hard that one poor person had an asthma attack because of it! I really did not mind that they had eaten the muffins- they were there for everyone to share after all.  Back to my train journey home, I have found this fish and chippery that is just between the train station and bus stop. Tonight I got a kids size chips (chip servings are REALLY REALLY big out in the western suburbs for some reason- kids chips is almost a meal in itself!!!) and I also got a lamb souvlaki with extra meat. I was only able to eat half of the souvlaki tonight; I will have the rest tomorrow for lunch. It was really nice though- and it is a shame I cannot eat it all tonight!   To eat it at home though, I had to carry the chips and souvlaki home on the bus. I hate it when other people carry on nice smelling food onto public transport- because it makes me so hungry. I felt guilty for bringing this food onto the bus- because I could smell the aroma of the souvlaki wafting throughout the bus.... everyone else must have hated me. Oh well- tough luck. :)  Tonight I came home and I (FINALLY!!!!) got my TXU duel fuel account. I signed up for this way back in February and it was only just processed recently. For those who don't know- duel fuel is where you get your electricity and gas on the same account, and you pay your bill each month at a pre arranged rate. Personally- I am paying $55 a month for gas and $55 for electricity. I am not sure if this is too much, but I am sure I will find out sooner or later. I do know though that for the gas in particular, it will work out to be a lot cheaper through winter (where I have been known to pay $300 a month for central heating alone) but more through summer where my overall gas usage is only about $30 or so a month (that’s mainly through cooking). Electricity- that’s pretty much the same- with a slight increase in winter due to the need to have the indoor lights on longer than in summer (because it is darker 4 hours sooner in winter than in summer!)  Anyway, it is getting close to 9pm- time to watch dead ringers.... I had better upload this blog!  Catchyas

      hellas hellas hellas, ole ole ole!!!  What a week it has been! Greece has won Euro 2004, while my better half has gone off for a 2 week holiday in Bali. It's all happening!  I guess I will start with what was the biggest thing to happen to the Greeks in Melbourne since (some say) the war! About 12,000 people converged onto Lonsdale and Russell Streets to see the action on the big screens- Greece vs. Portugal. Apparently some of them rolled up at about 8pm the night before- and many of them stayed well after the 7am-ish completion of the game.  I watched a little bit of it after I woke up to get ready for work. I actually woke up an hour earlier then normal- I was actually so excited by the game! Anyway I watched it and found out that watching sport is a lot more thrilling if you actually have a team to barrack for! Before, I just thought soccer was a rather boring game, but yeah, having Greece to support made it all the more interesting.  I guess the fact that EVERYONE I knew was going for Greece as well kinda had something to do with it as well- call it peer pressure if you will!  After the game, I called a few people and we laughed and made jokes about the poor Portuguese guys who cried at the end of the game. Pussies I called them- trying to cheat, lie and steal themselves out of the loss. I found it quite funny actually to see them falling to the ground (when no one else was anywhere NEAR them) and start crying as if someone had kicked them in the shins. I would gladly do that for them if that is what they wanted- heheh ;p  Anyway on the news that night they had footage of the thousands of people who turned up to the city to celebrate. I did not end up going this time around. I knew that if I went there, I would probably stay there all day. Friday was a big enough party with just 2,000 people there. Imagine that area going off with over 12,000 screaming, celebrating Greeks? I would never be able to tear myself away from it! (And let's not even get started on the eye candy that would have been on offer down there!)  The other big news this week is a tragic story, and guess most Melburnians would have heard of it- the story of that poor little girl who got hit by a tram last weekend.   She ended up losing her right forearm in the end.. But reading her story was just so sad. Imagine having something like that happen to you at that young age (13)- or at any age? It is not something you would wish upon anyone- the terror, the pain... yuck!   In the city though, looking at how people dart in front of trams expecting them to stop (trams actually have right of way over everything here) - it is amazing that more people are not hit by trams! But yeah, I was particularly moved by reading the story of that little girl. I hope she gets well soon!  Speaking of public transport, I now have a new position on the train. I now sit in the back of the second carriage from the front. This is where I used to sit on the Frankston train into the city. There is actually a bit more room there and I already know some familiar faces too.   in particular there is this one girl who looks like a movie star. She has been checking me out over the past few weeks, though I am unsure why she is even bothering. Oh well, it is all good, I like the attention anyways!  What else has been happening? Things are easing back at work. Actually I got advised that I am to be part of a new advisory body at work. What we are going to try to do is improve staff satisfaction with their jobs, while at the same time, increase productivity. It can be done! I have studied some human resource management in the past, and also I have been able to apply this knowledge to my work in the public sector- so it is all working out for me!  You would have probably have seen my mid week update- which was a cut and paste from www.abc.gov.au- about that Big Brother shock... I actually did not believe it when people told me about it at work, and then I read it and could not believe it at all.   How could something like this possibly happen?  In the end it was good to see her go back into the house. Monica and Ashalea are now gone- and this week we have Paul, Ryan and Catherine up nominated.  I really would like to see Catherine win, however I think she may be the one to go this week- which is a shame.  On a totally unrelated topic now- I can say with confidence that 'snail season' is over. Well it is either that or I have stepped on every single one of the things! I have not seen any for the past week or so, which is a very good thing.  Speaking of things that I do in the morning- I am really noticing it getting brighter earlier now.   One day last week, there was quite a bit of verga in the sky, and it looked absolutely spectacular as the sun was coming up. It looked like fireballs in the sky, all red and purple- just amazing.  Also, this week I discovered the joys of REAL coffee again. I bought a coffee machine from target over the weekend, and complement it, I bought some of that Green Label Harris ground coffee. It is really strong, and certainly got me buzzing! I noticed as well with that stuff that I am no longer in a foul mood late at night when I am really tired. I think that is a direct effect of the coffee lasting through the day. To make the most of this winning combination- I also bought a thermos flask- so I can take the coffee to work as well and drink it through the day at work. yummy.  Now jump to the other side of the working day- I got a lift home on Friday from work. It took me one hour to get from work to home by car... It would have taken me two hours by public transport... All the same though, I think I will continue getting the train, as due to the type of traffic encountered on the way back, we used up 1/4 of a tank of fuel on the way back. Incidentally, it takes only 30 mins to get to work on a public holiday where there is no traffic holding us up.  One very good thing to happen during this most recent weekend was that I actually won something on Tatts. I only do 4 games a week and I buy 10 weeks at a time (for $16)- anyway I got back $64.95 on one of those games. It was a total shock because I thought I might have won something, but I only thought I got 3 numbers only. It was a very nice surprise.  What else has been on my mind this week....?  I have decided that on public transport- screaming children should be banned- infact, all children should be banned- especially during peak hour. The same goes for people with bicycles. They are actually banned by the rules anyway (bikes during peak hour) yet idiots still bring them on anyway. As if the trains are not packed enough! Speaking of trains (again) connex has written a letter to all passengers asking them to be patient while they re-integrate the 2 train networks in Melbourne.   I don’t know why we ever had 2 in the first place. It is not as if they could compete against each other. We have now ended up with 4 different types of trains (at least) which mostly cannot be used on each others networks. I cannot wait until they are fully integrated again into the one network, hopefully we will get more frequent services- then again I should stick to dreaming! This government is not going to do something about it is it? ;p  I am trying hard to find things to connect the paragraphs in this blog with, but I am not having much luck!   Before I go tonight, I think I will share once again with everyone the songs that are going through my brain at the moment.  David by Gus Gus has really grown on me this past week. I used to really hate it but yeah, it is a creeper! Cry Little Sister by Lost Brothers is also a biggie. Finally, I am not sure if this has anything to do with Greece winning the soccer or anything, however I am getting really into Despina Vandi again. I LOVE her old songs Gia (club mix) and also Ypoefero (club mix).. boogie on down!!!!  Going back to the Greek thing again- we have been making jokes at work about preferring a nice big souvlaki (greek) to a bite size portion of Nando’s (Portuguese) any day! heheh  Anyway that’s enough for me tonight- catch you all later!   While things have been going well for me at work, I am also contemplating putting in an application for a job in the city, working for a similar department to the one I am in now. However, on the way home from work on the train, I got thinking- do I really want to start a new job with lower pay? I mean, where I am now pays the second highest wages in the public sector so to go anywhere else would be to take a pay cut. Oh well, I think I am happy where I am now. I will probably just put in an application and see how it goes.

      It's July, a new tax year, and new tax rates... which for some mean more money in their pockets at the end of every fortnight.... well for those earning more than $52K anyway... I am not quite at that level yet, but should get there in the next year or so... hopefully!  A lot has been made of other benefits available now from the government. Most notably, that $3000 bonus people get when they first have a child. People do not seem to realise though that they could have gotten MORE money under the old system. Think about it- up to $500 a year for 5 years (baby bonus)- totalling $2500, then the $220 or so from the immunisation payment, and another $840 or so for the maternity payment.... It's not as if everyone will be getting the $3000 as a lump sum either- as it can be paid in instalments if this is what people want... I guess that angle (and the fact that people will now be getting LESS) if of little interest to the media...  I am in no rush to do my taxes this year. I have an 'account' with the ATO which means I won't be getting a return for a couple of years. The good news is though I will be more thorough and will claim back as much as I can, and also, the interest they are charging is fully tax deductible... always a good thing.  Anyway, enough about money and taxes (I dont particularly like either much!)  Let's talk about how windy it has been all week! In the middle of winter, we get these gale/storm force northerly winds that come through the city. I actually look forward to this time of year, as it means it is sunny (for at least some of the time!) and dry as well. Only thing is, we've been getting one cold front a day, which means it is consistently windy and it rains at the end of every day.   I actualy got caught in the rain on thursday night. I was coming home on the Williamstown train, that was meant to depart at 6pm- however it did not leave until 10 minutes after this. When it did eventually depart, it crawled along the tracks at an achingly slow pace. I knew straight away that I would miss my Werribee connection at Newport. I thought I would be clever and get off at Footscray and catch a bus home from there instead- as I normally get the one that goes from there to Hoppers Crossing each night anyway, and I knew it started its journey at about the same time I got into Footscray.   Even though it was rainy and cold and windy, I ran across the overpass to that back street behind the Footscray Markets, but I was unable to find my bus stop. I had never actually been to Footscray before (apart from going through on the train) so I did not know where I really was anyway, but oh well... I had a little more of a look around for the bus stop, before going back to catch the next train home, which came in just as I returned to the platform.   I will have to find out where that bus comes from one day so I can get it all the way in from Footscray. It would be a lot nicer because the trains are a bit crowded (just a little!- note the sarcasm!) and yeah- the buses around here are consistently empty.  Speaking of crowded trains, I had to get the Packenham train home one day this last week. I got it in from Caulfield, and could not believe how packed it was. I honestly do not remember any train being that packed in my life! All the way up the aisles people were there standing unable to grab onto anything. When is connex going to do something about this? I really do not think connex will do anything about it, but its still nice to think that one day things will get better on the public transport front.  Actually, while we are on the topic of crowds, were any of you down at Lonsdale street yesterday morning? What a party! When I was getting ready for work, I remembered that Greece was playing in the soccer at Euro. I sat down to watch the final part of it (I did not switch it on until 6:30-ish) and actually got a little involved in the game. In the end I saw the goal that won Greece the game, however I did not realise at the time that they had actually won. It was only when screams of joy erupted across the neighbourhood that I realised what had happened. I also realised then that we had quite a lot of Greeks living in our neighbourhood!   Anyway, I decided then that I would go into Lonsdale street on my way to work to check out the celebrations. I did not get there until about 8:20-ish, and some of the people had already gone home. However there were still flares being let off, people still chanting Greek soccer songs and hugging everyone they saw- all in all- a pretty good celebration.  I found myself smiling to myself the entire trip into work- people who did not know any better may have thought I was on drugs or something, but it was the start to a very good day for me.  I got to do something a little different at work yesterday as well- and that was to run the elections for OH&S delegate for a couple of work groups. In the preceeding week, I had sent out a number of emails telling people how to vote and what to do if they were going home early and could not vote. Anyway it turns out that not all people read their emails, and one of the candidates got a little annoyed (to say the least!) about this fact. (I was not going to accept votes from people who could not lodge them personally- to ensure the integrity of the vote and everything. In the end I told the candidate that it was the voters problem, and not mine, if they chose not to read the explicit instructions on how to vote. It did not matter in the end anyway as to whether we could take those absentee votes or not- as that disgruntled candidate came dead last.  This will not be the end of it though, as I noticed that this candidate was rallying up support from those who possibly voted for him as we were leaving that work area. I think I will have great pleasure in telling him that he came dead last in the vote. There is a way of approaching someone to raise your concerns about an issue, and he did not do that with me very well. I am not one to suffer fools gladly, and he will find this out the hard way on Monday if he continues with his rantings of vote fixing etc.  I've decided I may want to stay on as delegate for a little longer as well (ie- union delegate)- after an interesting week on that front as well. I sent an email to all delegates in the country detailing a few resolutions that were passed locally in the past week. Boy did this set off a ehated exchange amongst our little group. It seems that I am not the only one dissapointed (putting it nicely) with the union at the moment. We have no local organiser, and no support from any other source at the moment. Even the supposed members service call centre in Sydney has told members and myself that they cannot help us.   There were a number of issues that I raised re things that the union was not doing for us. I got a response from one of the head people in the union- which gave me the impression she was saying "how dare you critisize my work- you are just a member, i am an elected official"- my thoughts on this are- "darling- you are an elected official- you work for us- you are not our boss- we are yours". She also mentioned in an email to me that she was not previously aware of the issues that are affecting a large number of delegates across the country. I feel this is an indictment on her, in that no one feels they can approach her with a complaint re service. In the end though, we flushed out a lot of opinion (mainly against the union and how it has been run) and a lot of support for our position locally that I shared with everyone. I might also stay only because now I get 22 hours of free time to do union things (22 hours of paid work time!) so I guess thats incentive enough isnt it? (nb- thats 22 hours every 4 weeks..)  Anyway enough of stupid union politics (and thats what it is, stupid...).. Today I went to DFO out at Moorabbin to do some 'window shopping. I did not get anything at all, I just went out to see how much things cost so I could do some budgeting and thinking about what I "really" wanted to get from those warehouses. DFO- for those who are unfamiliar with the store- is a large building (shopping centre) with over 80 major outlets there, all factory outlets- selling very cheap clothing and things that you would normally pay lots more for in a conventional shopping centre like Southland or Chadstone. There were a couple of jackets in Nautica that I particularly liked, $100 marked down from $399, and also some other shops as well with some nice jackets. I need to get some new jackets actually, as I have not bought a new one for over 3 years now, and my style and taste has somewhat matured in the past 3 years.   One thing that stuck me while I was in there was the fact I was finding myself in stores that I normally would never go into if it were just a normal shopping centre- for example- I was in Country Road, (and I will go back to buy an item in there)- but normally I would never go in there at all. I am glad I did now!  In the end I spent a little over 4 hours in there wandering about- and yeah, will have to go back in a fortnight or so.  I read in the paper about connex- how they are saying that the train delays and cancellations are to continue for at least another year while they intergrate the 2 old train systems in Melbourne. Just fantastic. Another year of getting millions of sms messages to my phone saying that another train has been cancelled or delayed. I must admit though I have been pretty lucky- in that so far I have had only one train cancel on me on my way to or from work (well those that have been notified by sms anyway!). I still will not drive to work though, as it is just too much hassle to get my licence at this old age!  Ummm... what else? Today I did something really boring (suprise suprise) and worked out Steves brothers BAS entitlement for the 02/03 financial year. I actually enjoy working out tax accounts for people, as I find it really easy and straight forward. I suppose working in the government as well I understand how to read legislation and government policy- whereas for most people it just confuses the hell out of them. He wants me to sign him up for BAS reporting... I am not so sure if it is worth his while, but in  the end- he will be a bit better off if he decides to go ahead with it. He has offered to pay me a couple of hundred dollars for each BAS statement I do for him- however I could never accept it. It took me only a couple of minutes to work out his tax liability- as his books were so well kept. He could really do it himself- as it is a really simple business structure, but he lacks the confidence to do so. Oh well, in the end it gives me something to do on my weekends!   Hmmm... big brother.. I am dissapointed Bree went this week. I am hoping Ryan will go one of these days. I would hate for him to win the million...  Anyway I have to get going- its bedtime!!!!   catchyas!
