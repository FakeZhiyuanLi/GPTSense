      Ok, I know I haven't written a Blog for some days now - but as they say; no news is good news.  Which means that I haven't been inspired, or aggitated to write about anything.  Until now.  You see today I am experiencing some slight PMT, which means that; All men are bastards, everyone is fecking me off, I'm emotional, ultra sensitive, mood swingy, and in great need of chocolate.  My boss was driving me up the wall with his nervous "sniff" which, I'm pretty sure isn't a cocaine addiction, but just a simple nervous sniff. He does it when he gets stressed. Although if I spot any white residue around his nose, I will let you know.  I am annoyed also about the weather.  Now, this time last year I was walking around the house in my underwear, whilst fanning myself with a teatowel - it was so goddam hot.  Today, however, I am sat here in my jogpants, my sweater and some nice snuggly socks for good measure.  Now, I'm not sure if the seasons are covered by your council tax, but what the hell, everyone else blames everything on the council tax, so i'm blaming the weather on it - I pay my Council Tax goddam it and I want it to be sunny and warm!!!   I shall now hold a protest until the warmer weather returns.

      Now, I have a bit of a bone to pick with the Met Office; What the f*ck is going on with the weather at the moment?  It's sunny, it's raining, it's winter, it's windy, it's rainy again, it's autumn, argh - enough I want the summer back!  Now I'm going to have to be forced to write a very strongly worded letter to the chaps at the Beeb if things don't improve within 4 days - time is ticking Bill Giles.... time is ticking...

      I went into town today to do some shopping therapy.  It was most needed.  I enjoyed it, but couldn't find anything I wanted to buy, so it spoilt it slightly.  Lots of sales are on at the moment, and I don't know if it's me but don't they always have some shit in the sales - and goddam it, they're always all the same size! And anything you do find which you slightly take an attraction to - isn't even in the bloody sale and it's on the wrong hanger!  grrrr...  Talking of some shit - there is a funny smell outside that smells like cow shit.  Ok rant over.  The wicked landlady is on holiday this week, so perhaps things will feel better.

      Ok so I admit I was wrong.  greece won euro 2004.  Which, although I don't like football or care about it very much, was quite a symbolic message to me.  As you will probably read in my previous entry, I said that I wanted Portugal to loose, which would probably never happen as anything I want never happens.  But this didn't happen and Greece won and therefore I got what I wanted - Portugal lost.  Stay with me here, I know I'm not making much sense.  So the moral of this story is that I mustn't automatically think that things are mapped out against me, sometimes things will go my way, nobody is out to get me.  Ok, I know I'm sounding crazy here, but I promise it makes perfect sense to me.  Congrats Greece.

      I think i've learnt more about myself in the last 3 days than I have ever done so in all my 27 years.  I have learnt that I enjoy blowdrying and straightening my hair.  I actually blame others for my own faults.  Even though it hurts like hell, I still bite the skin around and under my nails.  I am a dreamer.  I am sensitive.  Green eye shadow actually suits me.  I don't like change.  I like my friends.  I like my job.  Even though they look awfuk, I like my baggy old grey jogpants.  A vi-sprung bed is not the same as any other bed.  I cannot live without a scroll wheel on my mouse.  I like a quiet life.  I need to re-discover who I am to change.

      You know the episode i'm talking about right?  (I think you have to like the TV program friends to follow me on this one)  So Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are stuck in Monica's room whilst Ross and Rachel come home having an arguement and they end up having this arguement and "talking" for the whole night?  Well, I always watched that episode and thought, "what a load of crap, nobody would ever do that"  - But now my friends I am wise, I am wise to all this relationship crap, because I've just spent since 3pm this afternoon (it's not around 9pm) doing the exact same thing with my Boyfriend.  ARGH.  Portugal and Greece are playing the final of the world cup as we speak, i'm not sad that I am missing it, but I desperately want Portugal to loose, which means.. (as anything I want usually doesn't happen, because it's "shit on Ericka" week, that Portugal will win 2-0)  I'll post back later to let you know whether I was right.  Many I should put money on it.

      I've just had a thought, I haven't really introduced myself properly yet.  So here I am, Ericka, 27 and I live here in sunny Brighton.  It's not that bad, the sea is nice when the sun is out, but if it's not, it's kind of crap and dreary. I was born in September in 1977, I have two brothers (older) and therefore that makes me the token baby girl.  My mother prayed for ever for me not to be another boy, and luckily for her she was blessed with a little girl. Recently I've been having a little bad luck, so I've resorted to this diary crap for therapy.  I'm finding it quite useful and I quite enjoy poting my ramblings on here. I loved the film Shooting Fish and hated Titanic - mainly because you knew the ship was going to sink eventually - I like pasta, but can't eat it very often as I have a wheat allergy and it gives me hives.  I like freshly cut grass and leaves on the paths and roads in the autumn. I have a degree in product design and I did want to become the next Dyson dude and design some historic household appliance, but instead I work in an office with a bunch of over 40's who are gathering dust.  I type all day on the computer and have mouse strain in my right wrist.  I'm a sensitive soul, but I also have the bite of a bulldog when i'm really angry.   I love Tigi hair products, and nothing makes me happier than blowdrying my hair and straightening it - I used to have an urge to be a hairdresser in my younger years, but my family urged me into doing designer crap as it earns more dosh. I have a battered old Beatle car, which I love to bits, and her name is Wendy.  She's an awful beige colour, which reminds me of the centre of a cadbury's cream egg.

      I went back to that proverb site i told you about, and here is those cool quotes i found:   "When God sends us on hard paths, he provides strong shoes."  - I like this one   "The man who can smile when things go wrong has thought of someone else he can blame it on."  - I laughed at this one   "Some people grin and bear it.  Others smile and change it. "    "A fall will always make a wise man wiser."  - this is the one i was talking about in my previous post.

      A NEW DAY: Sounds very philosophical doesn't it?  "A new day"  well today is a new day and I am going to goddam take this  bull by the horns and yell "hear ye, hear ye"  in a loud take-no-shit kind of voice, "I am strong!  You will not shit on me, life!".  What do ya reckon?  Sounds scary huh?  I went on some proverb site which I found on google the other day and it had this quote on it that was pretty uplifting, and it's ironic that i should remember it in my desperate time of comfort.  It went something along the lines of bad things that happen only make a wise man wiser.  I'll try and find the actual quote, because obviously it will sound better.  Oh, and before i forget - now this is irony - but I applied for two jobs about a month ago and this morning I got two rejection letters back in one day.  But job rejection letters are the least of my worries, so I laughed in their faces.  I think I may also be going a little crazy, but i'll get back to you on that one.

      Rice Crispies - delicious!  Sprinkled in lashings of sugar (i'm sure that your not meant to do that, but who gives a F****)  It's funny how some things stay with you for a long time, i.e food you ate when you were a wee little person and the only reason you made your mum buy them was for the free fridge magnet.  So as you can tell I have cheered up a bit.  I watched this program tonight before Big Brother about these paramedics and A&E department documentry and it really got me.  It made me put my situation into perspective.  These doctors, paramedics and nurses are bloody marvellous - BLOODY BRILLIANT, they work astonishly hard - I for one could never deal with 4 motorcylist accidents and someone dying on me every day at work and being responsible for that - crickey - they are superhumans.  And to all Paramedics, Doctors, Nurses and anyone else who saves lives, this post salutes you men and women - A MEN!

      "101 ways to kill your landlady" catchy title d'ya reckon? on the best seller list?  I'm trying to make a positive come out of this negative y'see, so all suggestions are welcome.  I've just eaten an egg sandwich, and let me tell you that it was the nicest egg sandwich I have ever eaten in my life - I think the fact that it is the first thing I have eaten since breakfast yesterday is a good sign and possibly why I enjoyed it so much.

      Just to report on how things are going.  I watched Big Brother and the eviction - I'm not sure if I like BB this year or not - it's different. I still liked the BB with Helen and Paul the best, they don't make 'em like that anymore.  Anyway Marco got evicted, which I think is a good thing for the house as I think he was loosing it a bit in there.... anyway I won't go on anymore about BB though I promise.  So I'm feeling a little better, I remember Chris Martin saying something about wanting to quit the music business when Alan Mcgee totally dissed the band early on, but his dad just told him to go back in the ring and sock this McGee fella for a couple more rounds. Which, I think I feel like doing at the moment.  I may wake up tomorrow thought and feel totally different about the whole thing, but right now, this minute i feel like i can beat this day. And the bottom line is that I WILL! *does bulldog face* grrrrrrrr

      Good evening friends and foes (I like to add my foes, because without them I would not be here)  Just to introduce myself, my name is Ericka (it's unfortunate that I share my name with the male version Eric, I know). I am 27 and today I was not only kicked out of my flat by my wicked landlady, but I have split up with my boyfriend.  For that reason alone, I have re-named today, not the shittest day of my life, but the first day of my life - I know that sounds like some bible crap, but in these desperate times, nothing could be more bizarre.  This is a space I would like to share with anyone and everyone who's ever felt like shit, been shit on, or has just had a shit day.  Alas, everybody, no matter how perfect, will one day experience the feeling of utter crap.  Come! Unite! Mighty crap ones!
