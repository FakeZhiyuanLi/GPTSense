      I was watching the rock countdown and Slither by Velvet Revolver was like 17, almost all the songs on there were total pieces o' crap, but one of the only good songs was three spots away from not being on there.  Those guys working on our septic system finally left, but the next place they went to was my neighbor's two doors down who had something messed up with there plumbing. The guy kept coming to ask my mom stuff and it was like every 10 minutes the bastard knocked on our door and I answered it and he's like "Is your mom there?" and I had to go get her, and it really pissed me off, cus I'm not his slave or something.  I think I'm starting to like rock more than rap, not to say I don't like rap, but yeah. Cus I got birthday money from some of my relatives, so I went to best buy and got the velvet revolver cd, which I've only wanted for about a week, and the new The Roots cd, which I've been waiting for for months, and I've only listened to a few songs on The Tipping Point (The Roots cd) but I've listened to Contraband (Velvet Revolver) like 10 times straight through and am not starting to get even a little bored of it. And on the play list I made of some music I down loaded this week, the only thing even close to rap is two wyclef jean songs, and he's not really a rapper. This also happened when I bought the Ludacris cd, and the Phantom Planet cd a few months ago, the Ludacris cd has only been listened to like once, but Phantom Planet is still in my car cd player. I was thinking about it, and out of the last 10 cd's only two have been rap. I don't know why you'd care about any of that, but just thought I'd get it off my chest (and it's a big chest to get off of cus of the weight thing.)  Now I'm gonna write something I've said and you gotta guess when I said it. "She got her name cus she lets all the guys dock their ships!"

      I couldn't fall asleep again because of that damn movie and was up till about 4:00 am. I woke up at about 1:00 PM because the plumbing people called and asked for one of the guys working on our septic system to call the office. So I had to go under the crawl space and tell him, and it was dark, and there was insulation everywhere, and I've been coughing all day.  I went to gamebros today for the last time, and I was gonna buy a game but some other guy bought it right before I came. I hung out there for a while, it's been open since I was one which means 13 years. It kind of seems like this is the end of an era. I'm leaving middle school. Gamebros is closed. The dog I got right after a  6 month period where my first dog, my dad, and my uncle died, also died. I started liking Rock as much as I like Rap. So I feel like my life is a polar opposite of what it was when I first started 8th grade. 8th grade was a pretty depressing year because I made all those fat jokes and didn't care when anyone else made them, which makes me think I've finally excepted my fate that I'm fat and there's not much I can do about it.  I went to Fargo, ND the monday after middle school ended to see relatives, let me tell you it's one incredibly boring place. My relatives were fun, but after my mom drove around for awhile to see here old school and stuff there wasn't much else to do. All of the food sucks, you can't get much fresh fruit, fish or anything. All there was to do was watch godfather movies over and over again on my mom's laptop, and also simpsons dvds. One night I was up until about 6:30 in the lobby watching vh1, mtv, and mtv2 so I could find rock songs and watch the bass players. I pretty much learned all the lyrics of that Ashlee Simpson song "Pieces of Me," jeeze louise they played that song like every fifteen minutes.  I haven't gone to california this summer which has really pissed me off. There is so much to do in San Diego when I go down there to see my relatives. I didn't really know them until february of 7th grade, cus we hadn't talked to them or seen them since I was 3. They were mad at us cus my mom kept my dad at home because his cancer was terminal, instead of puting him in the hospital hooked up to tubes just to keep him alive for at the most a couple extra weeks. We finally got in touch with them in 7th grade, and we went down for a weekend a few weeks later. They acted like it was no big deal that we had been excomunicated from that side of the family for most of my life. After I got past that anger they are actually pretty cool people. I still haven't seen my oldest cousin though, he's at Harvard, and wasn't able to come to my bar mitzvah cus of finals, and hasn't been able to go down to san diego when we've been there. But he's engaged to some girl, so I'm hoping I'll get to meet him at their wedding, but with my luck something will happen and I won't be able to go to that.  Me (Sam Mandler) and Joey O'Leary have a really awesome band, and we're gonna be the new beatles one day. And then Joey will get shot John Lennon style, and my wife will die Linda McCartny style. So maybe being like the beatles isn't all it's cracked up to be.

      I am having trouble going to sleep because of that movie the village, god damn it was freaky. So to keep myself I have been drinking diet soda (remember I'm on a diet) and listening to that queen song Under Pressure.  I've also been watching that parody of This Land Is Your Land, that's some funny shit. Go watch it at ww.jibjab.com!  I was talking to Wes about how life sucked, and I decided that it really doesn't. Cus whatever shit has happened to you, it's happened way worse to someone else.  There are people who are obsessed with horses, but will never probablly get one, but then my mom owns a horse and neither of us ever ride it or anything, and it just hangs out at the ranch we board it at and gets fat, that seems really ironic to me.  Our sewage got all messed up today. because the pipes are supposed to go down to the sewer like this \ but they are like this U and so they got a bunch of shit (literally and figuratively) stuck at the bottom of the curve, and so now my mom has to pay a bunch of money to get it fixed. So I thought the solution should be we (the human race) get rid of toilets and go to the bathroom in our yard like our dogs.  A really good song is "Every Morning" by Sugar Ray, the guitar is just so simple, but really awesome, and it's a really happy song that fills you with optimism that you'll get a really awesome gf some day. Mark McGrath also has a really awesome voice.  The Presidential Election is coming up, and I don't really like any of the canidates, but if I had to vote today I'd probablly go with Bush, Kerry just seems to fake...and don't get me started on Nader.  That crush calculator thing is dumb, I put it in my info and I didn't get a single real crush list. I got one that was like sam you fat gay fag go to hell etc. another that was like asdkfljaefj;laskdf, and then one with some random names of people I've never heard of from someone named rita jones.  Mellissa broke her arm. That kind of sucks for her. Another thing that sucked for her was when Evan H. gave her 2 wedgies with her shorts when a bunch of people were there. That's probablly really emberassing. She didn't know who I was until like the end of this year I think.  Lakefair can be  a really depressing place especially whe you're fat. You see lots of couples and know you won't ever get a gf. And most of the fat people there are the redneck, trailer trash type. I really don't want to be white trash, but I guess that's my fate if I'm fat and live in Olympia. What also sucks for me, is even though I didn't go on any rides, if I had wanted to, I would probablly have to pay double tickets cus I take up two seats or something.  High school is going to really suck. I'll probablly be the first freshman who is to heavy for the senior to throw in the frosh pond. I also probablly won't be able to fit in my desk, so they'll send me to a disabled class, cus if i'm that fat it's probablly a disability right? PE is going to suck, I don't mind playing tennis or working out at the valley cus noones gonna make fun of you, but making fun of out of shape fat kids is always really fun at school. Some bigger guys, like Wes, noone makes fun of cus he's too likeable, but I piss a lot of people off, so I always get made fun of. And everytime someone makes a fat joke I die a little inside. I think I'd be a lot better off if I didn't have such low self esteem, but I do, so the only way to not care about fat jokes is to make lots of them myself. I wonder if there are people who don't go to the dances cus they are dateless, maybe after I get rejected for the first time next year, I can start a club for people who can't get dates to dances. Wow that would be really embarassing to be in that club, which sucks for me.  You know what sucks? When you like someone, but for fear or rejection you won't even tell your best friends who you like, much less ask her out. It's really troubling, but when someone knows who I like it's always ended up badly, and I've never had the guts to ask any of em out. Most of the people I have "liked" since being at Jefferson didn't know I liked them, and every once and a while when I have told someone who I like it seems that by the next day every one knows who it is, and the person even if you were friends with them trys to avoid you. They are also left labeled as the person fattie liked, which is something I would't wish on my worst enemy, much less the girl that I like.  You know what I wonder sometimes? What it would be like to be skinny. I've always been fat and probablly always will be. But I still wonder what it'd be like to be able to get 100 on the pacer, or run a 14 second 100 meter, or run a lap without feeling like you're on the brink of collapsing.  What really pisses me off about some skinny people is how they can get angry when they're called skinny, that just seems really silly to me, I'd give anything in the world for someone to call me that and mean it, and some people are offended when someone tells them that. Seriously, jesus fucking christ, you should be happy your metabolism is fast enough that you don't look like a fucking walrus. Another thing that makes me mad are skinny people who don't take advantage of the fact that they are athletic. I give 210% just to get 45 on the pacer (my all time best and twice as high as my previous record) and some skinny people quit after like 20, people like that sicken me.  Gamebros is going out of business today, and I'm kinda depressed about it. They are my favorite store and after today they will be no more. And do you know whose to blame? Nope it's not the rival game stores, it's all the people who stopped shopping there and supporting a local business just because they get a game a day or two later, and cost a dollar or two more.

      It's a proven fact that it's not healthy to be fat, especially as big as I am (fyi i'm huge) so I have thought of some ways to lose weight, tell me what's best.  1. Annorexia, those people are just skin and bones, and as long as I don't die I'll be really skinny which will kick ass.  2. Bullemia, those people can eat whatever they want and as long as they throw up afterwards they don't gain any weight, which would be totally awesome  3. Diet and Excercise, this is what I'm trying now and it's working (I've lost about 20 pounds since the beginning of July) but I want to be skinny by the end of summer, not just less fat, cus otherwise I won't be able to get a date to a formal, which would totally suck ass, and unless I start going to the valley every day I'm not sure if I can get down to the weight I want to be.  4. Go into coma, I could have someone like Karl shoot me in the head so I go into a coma, and then go on the food through a tube diet. And once I get down to a good weight I figure I'll just wake up, this seems like the best plan of all cus it'll be like one day i get shot, and when I wake up I'm all cool and skinny.  Aren't these ideas good? No? You're right they're dumb might as well give up and stay fat.

      That qualifies as the freakiest movie i've seen in a while. M. Night Shyamalan could take a guy reading a book and make it the freakiest thing you've ever seen. Those creatures scared me shitless. I didn't go to sleep until 5:30 am after I got back from that movie because I kept thinking the creatures were real. I talked to Crystal's sister most of that time it was a strange conversation. That went from what I do on a normal weekday to how funny it would be to take a poop...that's right... a poop... in crystal's shoe.

      I did a lot today even though I really didn't.  I woke up around nine (I know way to early for the middle of summer) because I had to go to a bat mitzvah for one of my mom's best friends daughter. Overall the girl did a really good job, and she had an unfuckingbelieavablyhot14yearoldcousin (yes its all one word) but I didn't go to the reception so I didn't find out she was 14 (she was "built" like a 16 or 17 year old, so the kids at her school are lucky to have some eye candy like that every day) and apparently she's really nice and stuff, so I kinda missed a fun night there, but what'reya gonna do? The bat mitzvot did a good job she did more torah than me, but I lead waaaaaay more of the service, so I guess we probablly practiced the same amount.  After I got home and got out of that damn suit I was wearing, and took a shower I went to best buy and bought some cd's. I think I made some really really good choices. I bought both of The Strokes' cd's and they are so freaking awesome. I also bought the Sugar Ray cd 14:59 and that has two of my favorite songs by them, Every Morning and Someday. I've listened to The Strokes more but I plan on giving 14:59 at least a few solid listenings.  I decided today who would be the coolest president ever, yes he's a Republican, but he's the type that even if you're a democrat and you're running against him you'd vote for him. His name is Rudy Guliani, and he is the shit. I will list a couple of awesome things he's done.  Took on and took down the powerful Italian crime family in New York. (I like the Mafia in the movies but real-life Mafia probablly really sucks ass.)  Cleaned up the streets and closed much of the decadent porn shops. (I like porn too but not the decadent ones, cus those are the seedy gross ones where watching there porn is so bad that just watching it could probablly give you AIDs.)  Had a vulgar "art" display with a female Jesus covered in shit taken down at a public art gallery. (I like vulgar art as much as the next guy, but not when it's in a public gallery where five year old kids go on fieldtrips too, put it in a private gallery, but I'll be damned if you make my taxes pay for that shit [no pun intended].)  Had Arafat ejected from the Lincoln Center and when Arafat asked why he told him because he was a terrorist. My personal favorite. (Arafat is the head of Palestine, he wouldn't agree to peace treaties in 2000 and encourages his people to go into Israel, and blow themselves up on buses, in cafes, and on crowded streets. If I were Guliani I wouldn't have just thrown him out I would have done to him everything in the list of things to do to Mr. Winkler, plus stuff so bad I can't even think of it.)  Went to every single FDNY and NYPD funeral he could which ended up being most of them. (That is just awesome. The fact that a mayor would care about his citizens that much is truly hearwarming, [sorry if that sounds gay] I don't think that many mayor's would find time dealing with something like 9/11 to go pay respects to people who died in the line of duty.  He was on SNL. He was on SNL like 7 years ago, and I was reading some reviews of it and it sounds like a really good episode. So there's another reason to vote for him, has Kerry been on SNL...I don't think so, he's to much of a square.  So yeah... if he runs for president in 2008 everyone has to vote for him. And put up signs all around their neighborhood, cus he is like freaking awesome. I know that I'd be really happy to be able to say when I grow up the first presidential canidate I voted for was Rudy Guliani.  Ok enough of my political agenda. I played a bunch of basketball today and lifted weights for awhile. I've upped the stacker2 to 2 a day. It's ok don't worry, the reccomended dosage is 3, and I'm still one under that, and it's ephedra free people, so get that through your head. God damn... I'm pissed about not getting to meet Mira's hot cousin (Mira is the girl who had her bat miztvah.) I'd probablly never see the girl again but damn it still angers me.  I need a happy song to get my mind off of that, so I'm gonna listen to some Sugar Ray. Well that's all I have for tonight, so remember, if we start campaigning for Guliani now, we'll have no trouble getting him into office com November of 2008. Oh yeah and stupid Gold Crest won't let me put political signs in my yard, and my mom won't let me get a Bush sign and put it in my room so if I get a Bush sign I'll have nowhere to put it which is really depressing me. I could frame it and hang it in front of the John in my bathroom so when people go to use the bathroom they will get some of my Republican propaganda, I know what a great idea.

      Like I said this post is completely pointless, just a few things I wanted to cover while they were still on my mind, and while I'm still totally awake.  First of all I've decided to start a club. "A club?" you might be asking, "what type of club?" It's nothing as cool as say the Fat Kids club, which isn't such a bad idea, or the I Bet When I Buy My Homecoming Ticket They Make Me Buy Three, Two For Me, And One For My Date club, both of which I am a member of. It's the Make Mr. Winkler's Life Suck club. You don't do much, and there aren't meetings or a fee to join. All I want is for the world to be a more hateful place, when it comes to that craphead at least. Oh and you get a prize if you find out his adress for me so I can egg the bastard's house. Um yeah, so sign this post with your name, and you're in, and I'm gonna make cool cards for the club, oh and don't tell "The Man" about the club cus then he'll lock me up and throw away the key, cus yeah that's what he does.  Also I've come to the conclusion I like rock alot more than I used to. If you were to look at the songs on my RealPlayer you'd see there isn't a single piece of rap. I don't know whether it's because of the big push from a ton of people this year to get me into heavy metal and punk, or just that the rap industry, although making more money than ever, not making nearly the quality cd's that  were coming out in the early 90's or as I like to call them The Golden Age of Rap. Pietro is probablly partly to thank (or blame) for all of my rock cravings lately, but he was trying to get me into old punk and metal. And I'm into stuff like Rooney (Power-Pop) Sugar Ray (Pop-ish Grunge) The Strokes (Alt-rock at it's best) White Stripes (Bluesy Rock.)  I'm not sure if anyones still reading it, but if you want an explanation for the stupid ass post, it's cus 10 years from now I want to look back and be able to remember when I decided I like my pop-ish soft rock more than my swear-laced gangster rap.

      Today was incredibly boring, so I'm gonna try and keep this post incredibly short (at least compared to some of my other posts.)  I really didn't do much today, I ate really crappy yesterday because we had company over so today I've had tofu, brocolli, and bannanas. I think I'll probablly lose some weight because there's no way I could have taken in more than 1000 callories max, but I did lift weights and jog.  I went to see Napoleon Dynamite again today with my neighbor, it's even better the second time, I notice more stuff that I didn't catch before (either I was talking to Megan, or I was gone getting popcorn to throw at Jared and Ashley!) The jokes are still hilarious, and since there's not much plot in the movie it's not like now I know the ending so there's no point in going, because although I wasn't sure if Pedro would win the fact that he does doesn't crappify the movie for me.  This also reminded me of the two really good songs in it that I down loaded, one is called Forever Young, and that's by Alphaville. The other is a White Stripes song called "We're gonna be friends," both are pretty awesome, and they both work really really really well in the movie.  I know the first time I saw it I said the previews were sucky, but actually they were pretty cool. The Johnny Knoxville movie looks hillarious "I've been pretending to be mentally challenged, so I can fix the Special Olmpics," holy shit that's one funny line. The other one Hero which is produced by the same people who did Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon looks fucking unreal, in the sense that it has the same supernatural style of martial arts that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon pulled off so well. The shot with the girl standing in that orchard with red flower pettal things is freaking awesome, and it stars Jet Li, who after Jackie Chan, is my favorite martial artist.  That's all that really happened today, there was a bunch of crappy tv on, and I gave ratings to all my songs that I have on realplayer.  Everyone go see Napoleon Dynamite, it's the funniest PG movie ever, and one of the best movies to come out this year.

      I was reading some news sites, just cus that's what I do, cus I think the news is super cool, well I don't, but I like to know what's going on in the world and I found this really really odd piece of news, and I thought wow everyone should see this.     Serena Prasad, 22, got into a fight with her boyfriend in Turlock, Calif., on May 2 and allegedly stabbed him several times in the chest, but seeing that he was injured, put him into her car and headed for the hospital. According to a police account, while she was stopped en route at a traffic light, she realized that her boyfriend had not had enough yet, and she walked around to the passenger side, stabbed him again in the shoulder with a steak knife, and kicked him in the head, but police happened by, and she was arrested on a charge of attempted murder.    That's like the funniest think I've seen in a while. I think Ashley and Jared have that kind of relationship, maybe it's the red hair that leads me to believe she could go psycho at any moment. I bet the only reason he stays athletic is so that when Ashley goes nutso on him he can escape with minimal injury. Maybe that's wrong too, but it'd be funny as hell if it were true, though I'd feel bad for Jared.  I bet Mr. Winkler has this kind of relationship with just about everyone he knows, except he's the one with the steak knife and not the other way around. Mrs. Rae too, she seems like the crazy knife weilding type.

      Today was a really long day!  I had to get up at around 7:20 am cus I needed time to take a shower and stuff before my 8 am dentist appointment. I felt like I was gonna pass out when I got there, and everyone in the dentist office from the receptionists to the head dentist guy said how tired I looked. The dentist who came and got me was really happy, and when I sat down in the chair she said my shoes looked comfortable, which was an odd thing to say if you ask me.  Before they fill a cavity they numb your mouth and give you nitrous to breathe. The shot in the mouth hurts, it feels like when you get pinched really hard by a girl with nails but in your mouth. The nitrous is awesome though, you feel so high, and you think everything is funny, I'm thinking of taking up dentistry just so that after a long day I can relax with some nitrous. I heard "Where are we running," by Lenny Kravitz on the speaker system while they filled my cavity, and that was pretty cool cus I like that song. They were talking alot, and they would ask me questions and because my mouth was being held open, and it was really numb saying anything just came out as like "aaaaah" and whenever they made a lame joke I'd laugh cus everything was funny. Like if someone had come in and held a gun to my head, and been like give me all your money or your dead, I probablly would have started cracking up.  I don't like the dentist because I never can see what they are putting in my mouth which is sort of frightening, and they cut one of my gums a little bit so like when I brushed when I got home it started bleeding, and it still kind of hurts so that sucks. And where they put the shots in hurts too, and the filling feels really odd.  When I got home I got two sleep for two hours before tennis, and I didn't have to worry about finding clothes or taking a shower cus I did that before the dentist, woohoo.  The level four lesson today kinda sucked. I got stuck with this girl who has a horrible serve as a parter, so when we played doulbes up-down with serving even though I only had one double fault the whole hour it seemed like she only had one good serve. I also was having to run back and fourth cus she kept missing her vollies and I had to try to get the ball back in play. Also whenever I said switch she'd just stand there, and then they'd hit a winner to the other side that if she had moved she would have gotten. It was great when max, and daniel got down there though, cus then we played hit max, where max runs around on the court and me and daniel try to hit him, it's the most fun I've had today besides the feeling of the nitrous in me.  Today in level five we played feed out doubles, where the coach people feed, and the two teams play out the point and whoever misses the ball goes out but there partner stays, and the person in the front of the line goes where the person who missed was. I did pretty well I won about thirty points, and only like 5 or so people in the class of like 25 got higher than me I think. I was also getting around my half of the court really well, and my lobs were second to none.  Today I made some tea and I remembered when I burned my leg. So I thought I should write about it just in case some of you haven't heard the story. It was the night before the last day of school in seventh grade, my mom was at her friends house and I was alone. I wanted to stay up all night for whatever reason so I boiled some water and made some hot chocalate which would give me the energy I needed to pull an all nighter.  I was walking back to my chair with the  HOT!  chocolate when my dog, who likes to jump up on people decided to jump up on me. My hand was hit and the hot chocolate tipped over all over my leg, it was the worst pain ever. I was running around the house screaming like a mad man it hurt so bad, I went to the shower and turned on the cold water and put the nozzle right on my leg, it worked breifly but really didn't help with the pain.  I heard my mom pulling into the garage, and somehow managed to get over near the door to ask her what to do. First she said put ice on it, but after a minute of that it wasn't helping and huge blisters were shooting up on my leg. She said that this was more serious then she thought and that we needed to go to the hospital. The drive over was one of the worst experiences of my life, the pain was getting worse, and my leg was one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen. When we got there, I got in right away because there weren't many people there at 11 at night, and anyone could see how bad it was getting. They had to let all the blistters come up before they could dress the burn, and it took about half an hour from the time I got to a bed till the time they finally got me a shot for the pain.  The shot made me really dizzy, and high feeling, I passed out and woke up at about 1 in the morning with cloth wrapped around my leg. This is when I found out that my right thigh was like one big second degree burn. The shot hadn't worn off, and they needed a wheelchair to get me out to the car because I was too dizzy to walk.  The next day it hurt really bad, and when I redressed the burn I got to see how gross it was, there were like one inch tall blisters, and some had popped during the night and covered my leg in a yellowish puss.  It didn't hurt much after this first day, but I still could walk much and when I went to Wes' birthday I could barely walk much less try bowling. When it finally healed I was left with most of my right thigh discolered and scarred. alot of that has gone away a little over a year past the fact, but the scars are still there enough that any boiled water turns me into a nervous reck, so much so I haven't had a single glass of hot chocolate since then.  Yeah what a great story, eh? It's got goriness, and pain, and getting high-ish. I should adapt it and make a movie, and my character would be played by Denzel Washington. Is that a good idea or what.  I'll probablly write more later cus we have company coming over, and there's bound to be lots of weird conversations, and Bush bashing (they're all really left wing!)

      My life has been excruciatingly boring as of late. All I've done is played tennis and looked around online for ways to lose a lot of weight if not by the freshman dance then definately by homeocoming.  I've subsisted on the same fruits and vegetables, with almost no variety in what I eat or drink. I eat lots of apples and banannas, and rice. All I drink is water, green tea, and propel fitness water during tennis. As you can see my summer has kind of been shit.  I really hope all this effort pays off cus I want to take up snow boarding again this winter, and since my friend will have had his license for six months by then we can drive up to crystal like every weekend. I would have the last couple of years, but by the middle of ski n snowboard season in sixth grade I was so so so pathetically out of shape after going down one of the not so hard, but not bunny hill easy runs I'd be worn out, which sucked cus I couldn't snowboard all day like I would have liked too, and it was embarassing.  I'm getting a cavity filled tomorrow, which sucks majorly bad. I hate the dentist, they scare me with there perfect teeth and poky things, and how they say all the abbreviations for stuff when writing stuff down so for all you know they could be saying you have life threatening cancer in your teeth.  That's all I can think of. So yeah...

      Let me set a few things straight. Yeah I broke my no fast food rule the day after I started it, you don't need to remind me I'm not proud of it or anything, and I haven't slipped up since.  If you want to leave a comment and be really critical of what I do a la the anonymous comment on my post, Movie and food (that I didn't eat,) think about if it's really worth it.  Talking to a hot girl isn't as easy for some people as it might be for others.  The stacker2 I'm taking is ephedra free that means no side effects except for the high type of feeling you get from all the caffeine in it, so don't tell me it's really un-healthy and stuff.  Going a day without eating isn't as easy for people who are used to overeating almost every day as it might be for a really skinny person who doesn't have food and weight problems.  I don't write this thing to get told off, I write it so I can look back and be like oh yeah that was funny, and to entertain people like Dylan K. So if you're gonna be a bitch don't bother reading it.

      I lost a pound yesterday because I didn't eat anything, but today during tennis I kept having bad sideaches and stuff, but if that's the price I pay to be skinny I'm ok with that.]  There was some other funny stuff that happened yesterday that I was too lazy to write about. Like when John said something about stealing Laura from Dylan, so Dylan said he'd kick John in the nuts and then we made up a thing like the green eggs and ham thing but it was like would you beat him in a box, would you beat him with a fox. It was really funny, but'd you have to have been there to get it.  It was great during the dinner when Jeff was eating me and john kept touching his pizza, and pretending to lick our fingers and touch it. And then we sat and stared at him without blinking while he ate, and we were like "pretend we aren't even here" and he's like "ok" so then when he puts the pizza in his mouth we started touching it. Me and John picked pieces of the artichoke off the pizza, and we decided we owed Megan, seven and three quarter cents for them, that's another thing that would only be funny if you were there. Me and Jeff also threw tomatoe chunks at eachother.  Tilt is being remodeled and I had no idea until me, john, and dylan went to play games at tilt, but they were all closed up which made me mad.  I'm still laughing at some of the stuff from the movie, like when Napoleon was eating his tater tots in class and he wouldn't give any to the other kid so the kid smashed them with his foot.  Tennis was pretty cool today. When I took a shower this morning there was no shampoo which made me mad, and then my mom said she'd get some while I was at tennis and surprise, suprise, she didn't. There weren't many people at tennis, cus it was raining, and people like to sleep in when it rains. There were only two teachers Bobby, and Jordan (who was sick yesterday and could barely talk at all, he was also really iritated about something, I think.)  The games were all pretty boring in the level four lesson it was half court singles, and I did reasonably well, I was down to the second to last half court but got back up to the half court third from the top. Then during the next lesson we played team doubles and I was on the best team with 2 kids who are really good players and are gonna be juniors, and then me and this kid john (who's the son of my mom's stock broker) are both going into ninth and we are both pretty good especially in doubles. We only lost once the whole time, and that was a close game. We were at the top court pretty much the whole time, and then when we had a rematch with the team that beat us we didn't just beat them, we humiliated it was like 21-9, and I couldn't have been happier. The stacker2 excelerates your body alot so I sweat so much and it's really gross. But that's more water weight that I'm losing which makes me happy as hell. I got good news yesterday but it's a secret. One of the teams were really poor losers and they said like all of our feeds were bad, and that we were calling good balls out, even though they were doing all of that, but we whooped them every time. It's lessons like that that remind me what I love about tennis.  Heres a good line from Napoleon Dynamite "So what are you gonna do today Napoleon?" "Whatever I feel like, GOSH!"

      Today a bunch of us went to a movie, Napoleon Dynamite, it was a lot of fun and stuff. And the movie was great.  Before the movie we all met at Vic's for pizza, we being me (Sam), Dylan, John, Jared, Jeff (who didn't go to the movie,) Lisa, Laura, Megan Leonard, Megan Kelley (sp), Kelly, Ashley, Lena, and that was it. They ordered a shit load of pizza, like 3 eighteen inch ones. I didn't eat any cus of my no crap food diet, and when John asked why there was so much pizza left I said cus the fat kid didn't eat as much as they thought he would.  During the course of the dinner a lot of hillarity ensued. Such as when John said Ashley was eating a lot of pizza cus she's eating for two (pregnant) and I asked her "Is it true?" and then said her silence ment yes, me and John then had to go to the other table otherwise we would have been beaten within an inch of our life I think. Lena and Ashley kept putting cheese into eachother's drinks, I don't really get it, I think it's a girl thing, and that the girls on the other side of the table were probablly doing it too, but I don't know cus fat kids weren't allowed on that side of the table. There were a couple of awkward parts that noone else really picked up on, like when they were saying there weights and someone said a really low weight and was like I'm so unhealthy, it's like Jesus Christ, you got a kid who was over 200 at the beginning of summer so quit your whining. Other awkward parts were when I had to explain to a bunch of people I wasn't eating cus I can't eat greasy pizza on account of I'm fat. For the first time ever noone was really upset at my fat jokes, cus it's always only like one person who says I need to stop, and then everyone else says something just so they don't sound like a jerk, but noone actually cares they just say it so they look compassionate.  Me, John, and Dylan walked to the movie before everyone else cus we wanted to be not late. Everyone got there like fifteen minutes before anyways so it was all good. There was this car with a couple of teens in it and I looked at the girl in the back cus she was alright, I wasn't gawking or anything, but they rolled down their window, and she said "I'm taken" and the guy called me a queer or something. When we got to the mall parking lot there was this truck that we walked past, and all of a sudden a dog went nuts, and I hadn't seen the kennel in the truck and just about killed john I jumped so far. I had like a mini asthma attack it freaked me out so much. Before the movie Megan K. wanted to go play the games in the lobby so I left my soda with the other Megan (big mistake! she drinks so much of it!) and went to play games with her and david t., but they were playing police trainer together and getting all flirty together and so I left them and went back to the theatre, and when asked where they were I said the photo booth with the occupied sign on it (you'd have to have been there to get it!)  None of the previews were too memorable, the one new show Joey! with Matt LeBlanc looks good, and the John Goodman show looked ok, but not like something that would get good ratings.  Jared and Ashley were getting there freak on just a few seats away from us, it's pretty disgusting, so I told them to get a room, and Jared being the nice, polite person he is flipped me the bird...jerk! This display of kindness made me go get a small popcorn from the lobby so next time those two started getting it on in there seats me and megan could throw popcorn at them. Suffice to say none of the popcorn got eaten and one of the people who works at the cinema is going to really have there work cut out for them getting the theatre clean. We also threw the empty popcorn bag, and empty soda cup thing, with the straw, covered with me and megan's germs, still in it. I don't think Jared or Ashley are on very good terms with me, and wouldn't be suprised if I found out both of them have blocked me on AIM.  The movie was fuckin awesome. So many great lines, "Hey Tina come get some ham!" "Girls like guys with skills like Numbchuck skills, and bow skills" lol. And then "Why are you all sweat?" "I've been practicing" "Practicing what?" "My dance moves!"  Jared made Megan bleed, what a mean guy.  Here is a story from tennis, I didn't play for like half of my level five lesson. I was a little late because there was a line at the casheir so I could pay for my gatorade, so then I got there and I didn't have a team for a game so I just talked to Andrew (14 year old who helps teach the class cus he is one hella good tennis player.) We talked about how whiny kids in the class were how I was fat, and how chicks like fat guys too (I don't know where he thought that up, cus it sure as hell ain't true other wise I'd have a gf.) I finally went to play and was on one good team, we one most of our games till it switched to team doubles and then we started losing most of the games (no communication.)  The hot girl looked good today, still didn't talk to her, but whatryagondo? It was great cus when we left the theatre I said "I'm sorry for ruining your movie going experience" to some lady. After everyone had gone, I was waiting outside and these four fat asses (bigger than me, if you can believe someone's bigger than me) were hitting eachother with bottles and there were like 20 people out side and we were on the opposite side of them, and we were all laughing and making fun of them cus one of their voiced cracked when he called his friend a "fucking queer bait," their words not mine. That's about all for today. Here's a Jay London one liner "I'd like to leave you with a joke," for some reason the way he delivered that was hillarious.

      Today I decided I wasn't going to eat anythign until the movie. It's working really well, I still drink water cus otherwise I'd pass out during tennis, but I haven't had any solid food all day.  Stacker2 really helped my tennis game today, I took it and after the jitteriness that I get from the amount of caffeine in there went away I was able to play harder than usual without getting tired. It's amazing what science can do today.  I saw Lindsey leaving the valley, but she didn't see me so I figured no point in saying anything. I was talking to Varsity anyways, thats what I call him because he goes to a really small high school and so he was on the Varsity tennis team as a freshman, I'm not sure what his real name is though.  I've lost another couple of pounds since the last time I weighed myself which kicks ass, and I'll lose a bunch during August I bet, because I'm taking Stacker2 the miracle drug.  I've decided Maroon 5's cd "Songs about Jane" or whatever it's called is my favorite cd right now. The bass player is great, and they aren't hard rock (which I don't like, except for Velvet Revolver) everyone should go buy their cd on account of it's awesome.  I'm seeing Napoleon Dynamite tonight with a bunch of people. It looks good, they're going out to eat before it, but I don't want to have pizza on my diet, and cus i'm not eating today so I'll probablly hang out there but not eat anything.  Yeah that's about it, here's a good one liner from the one...the only Jay London "You may recognize me... I'm the fourth guy from the left on the evolutionary chart." That's a classic.

      If I had to pick the best trip of my life it'd definately be the trip to Spain there was so much awesome stuff that happened there even though I was the only sixth grader and didn't know/ like most of thepeople on there.  The first awesome memory was on the flight over when there was a spanish kid about a year younger than me, and using my handy dandy spanish phrase book I talked to him like the whole flight over, and he let me listen to some spanish rap which was pretty hardcore if I do say so myself. Then the plane flight was over and I never saw him again, but he was a pretty awesome guy.  Another great memory was when at our hotel they served us bad fish and like half of the trip got diahreeah and the boys room was really bad, cus four guys + one bathroom + dihareea= one bad ass smelling room.  One of the other funny things was when the high schoolers from like Bellingham who came on our trip got really really really really really drunk. They were so messed up, and yeah they were drunk out of their minds, and then they all went to Burger Kind.  Another fun thing was when I got lost walking around Costa Del Sol, and this nice, fat, old, taxi driver gave me directions on how to get back to the hotel.  Hmm... that's about it for good/funny stuff, but it's enough that that trip kicked ass, and now I want to go again during high school with the spanish teacher or something.  "I would of told you I wasn't gay if you had taken your cock out of my mouth!" Funny line from Andrew Norton on last nights Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn, which is like the funniest show on tv, and everyon needs to watch it.  Here's another awesome Jay London one liner.  "I wanted to get my girlfriend breakfast in bed, but she said one pig under the blanket's enough." Wow what a funny, funny, guy!

      Me and Taylor B. were talking about how we like to make it mad enough it tells us to apologize, so I decided to piss it off a lot. It was great. It gave me a definiton of apology...  SmarterChild: I see you still aren't getting it. Let me share a definition of "apology" with you:  Etymology:  Middle French or Late Latin; Middle French apologie, from Late Latin apologia, from Greek, from apo- + logos speech  : an admission of error or discourtesy accompanied by an expression of regret.  Get it? Now say you're sorry.  He gets so anal about things, just cus I said fuck you enough times I was over the rate limit doesn't mean he needs an apology. Geeze people have said tons of bad words to me, but I don't tell them to apologize, so I'm come to the conclusion SmarterChild=Loser. And he supports Kerry, what an idiot. Kerry is a creep (no offence to people who like him, he just bugs me for some reason.)  Hmm... in other news, Stacker2 totally kicks ass. It's got a sumo load of caffeine, and so I have one and then I can work out for like an hour and not be warn out, and it burns fat and boosts my metabolism, it's like my super drug, and it's going to get me down to the weight i want 150 or so, by the end of the school year, I think.

      I guess a lot of stuff has happened today, which I guess is pretty freaking sweet!  I went to the valley at 6:00 am and played basketball for an hour, my 3-pointer is getting pretty good, and my free throws are more consistent than ever. I got up at five to get ready, but I only got about 4 and a half hours of sleep, cus I was watching boxing.  Boxing last night wasn't too good cus it was two old heavy weights. One was 32, and the other was 38. The 38 year old was like 5'11" and tipped the scales at about 238 the other guy was about 6'2" and only weighed four pounds more. The 32 year old easilly one the fight, because he was in better shape, younger, quicker, with a longer reach, and his last fight had been for the title against Vitali Klitchko, but he lost that one cus he was 260 and in bad shape. There was a great Behind the Glory on one of the best middle weights ever Sugar Ray Leonard. My favorite fight was his second against this bully Roberto Duran, and he went all Ali/Emmanuel Augustus and showboated so much and wooped Duran's ass so bad, that Duran quit in the middle of the eigth round. During the credits there was this great old time R&amp;B song that was like "It's yooour daaaay Sugar Raaay, and everybody loves you, It's your day Sugar Raaay" and it did that over and over again but still remained catchy.  Tennis was fun today. I wasn't playing very well to begin with but I got over that. One of the teachers tested my reaction time by hitting a ball at me, so I hit a good overhead later and got him back. There's a really hot girl in the class, but I'm too embarassed to talk to her, so so much for that, but she's really hot. When I went to get a gatorade after my first lesson (I take two back to back) I noticed on my way back that I had a runny nose so I got in the bathroom and got a paper towel and when I blew my nose it was covered in blood. So I don't know how I got it, but I had one bad ass bloody nose, and missed the first few minutes of my lesson trying to get that under control. I was really tired in my second lesson cus I had played basketball and not slept very well, so I kind of stopped trying after awhile.  My mom had a hair appointment downtown right after tennis so I had to sit in the lobby of the salon for like an hour reading rolling stone, which is an alright magazine, but I don't care for the couple of pages in every issue devoted to Bush bashing, which I really don't think is necessary or appropriate for a serious music magazine. There was some interesting stuff in it though. Like Lindsay Lohan in a bikini, that was probablly my favorite article. And then some stuff about how file sharing is up but the legit stuff like itunes and cd sales are up too so it's all good in the hood, no wha m' sayin? Yeah the whole gangster talk doesn't work so well online.  I went to taco bell and got 2 chalupas, they were good, the gave me so much fire sauce though, so I put it in my fridge to put on rice and sandwhiches and stuff.  Yeah actually now that I think about it today was pretty damn boring.  Here's a good Jay London one liner "My girlfriend had crabs, so I got her fishnet stockings"

      I'm gonna start taking drugs to lose weight...no not crack, or speed, or heroine, or cocaine, or something like that but Stacker 2. I always see those commercials so it must not totally suck. Coupled with my new, no fast food, less snack diet, and going to the valley pretty much every day, I think I can get skinny enough to get a date, that doesn't suck, to a formal by the time the second or third one comes around, but I'm probablly out of luck for those freshman dances and the first formal, unless I do that coma thing.  When I'm strong and skinny I want to get in lots of fights. I want to beat up so many people. Mainly Vin Sanders, who's always giving me shit about being jewish, and fat, but it's just cus he's a little fag, and when I'm strong I'm going to totally beat the shit out of him.  Also I haven't forgotten about my least favorite person from last year...Mr. Winkler. Who gives me a fucking B even though I try harder than hell to do good in PE, but skinny kids who just barely do good enough can get fucking A's, if you're going to act like that you commy bastard, why don't you go teach PE in North Korea. I think I'll just c/p the rant from my buddy profile, if anyone hasn't read it.    Mr. Winkler

      Today was my birthday. A bunch of people called to tell me happy birthday at like 10:00 give or take an hour, but I wasn't awake until 1:00 pm, so my mom had a list of relatives and stuff I had to call, which was annoying as hell.  I sat around the house and played Espn NFL 2k5 which is a fun as hell game, until about 3:00. Then I took a shower and stuff, and changed clothes so I could play tennis. I was only playing ok today because I have a really bad cough so in the middle of a point I'd start coughing and was having trouble breathing, much less trying to get that damn green ball over the net. I figure I'll be over it by tomorrow so I'll be fine at my lesson.  Does anyone know what are some good weight loss stuff, like criatine, or stacker 2 or something, cus I gotta lose weight, and I hear drugs are the way to go.  One of my mom's best friends since college and her family came over for dinner, that was sorta fun. Her son's only 2 months younger than me, so we just played basketball most of the time. He's skinny, and the only reason I beat him is cus he hasn't played since the end of basketball season at his school, and he was incredibly lazy about defense and stuff.  I'm gonna start going to the valley three days a week at like 6:00 am, to work out with all the people who mumble stuff like...look at fatty trying to jog/lift weights/use the rowing machine etc. etc. you get the picture. Well at least I think they say that, but then I'm all paranoid and shit, but better safe then sorry when it comes to fat jokes.  I don't know when I'm getting my bass, but I know it's this week, I'm gonna order the Queen bass book, cus they are the shit. I also want the nirvana bass book, and the foo fighters book, cus those are cool as hell bands too.  I'm watching the "Slither" video on Real One Player, it's pretty cool, but my monitor is so much smaller than my tv, and the video quality is cruddy, so it's not as cool as on one of those crap music channels. And the lead singer's pants in that video disturb me, they're just a little too tight in my oppinion. He should take a page out of the rap fashion book, and wear some bagg pants, so I'm not able to tell whether he's a jew or gentile (whether he's circumsised or not) (that's an exageration, they're not that tight.) Slash looks pretty kick ass in that video though, so it's all good.  Now I'm watching "Cold Hard Bitch" by Jet. That video is like so cool weird, like Napoleon Dynamite. That's a good cd, I haven't listened to it as much as I probablly should. The Mase video "Welcome Back" is pretty damn cool too.  This is my first post in the month of August, it's amazing how the two days since I made this have flown by. I feel like a totally different person.  The Rolling Stone Magazine headline cracks me up this month. It's about Lindsay Lohan, and it says "Hot, Ready, and Legal" they're just trying to get pedophiles to buy their crappola magazine. Even though it's legal for them to think she's really hot, it's still really weird.  Has anyone else noticed all of Maroon 5's  singles have been somehow sex related.  Like "Harder to Breathe" is about orgasms, and "This Love" has a line about keeping her cumming every night, and "She Will be Loved" has a line like "I've had you so many times, but I still want more" and the video is about this guy thinking his gf's mom is a M-I-L-F Milf! But you'd be hard pressed to find a single parent who wouldn't buy their cd for their kid, cus they do it in such a round about way, that you barely even notice what they just said. You're just like wait a minute... did they said what I think they said...hmm...?  Yeah that's about it, here's a funny one liner from Jay London, of Last Comic Standing 2..."I once saw a stationary store move!" That's it, ok go away.

      Ok so this is gonna try and re-cap the last couple of days, plus all of the random political and other junk I always put in.  The last few days have been pretty much the same, four hours of tennis due to the camp, and that's fine, yeah that's about it. Today I was stuck with Andy Dsari (sp?) as a partner in one of the tennis games, and he fucking stinks. He missed like all of his shots. I'd get like 10 shots in a row, and we'd be about to win and he'd miss an easy as hell shot. I think I'll make the JV team at Capitol as long as they don't descriminate against me because they think I'll suck cus I'm fat.  One of the tennis pros got so pissed off today. Jordan was supposed to help at the camp, but he was giving a lesson and he said Andrew could help, and then Doug went to Trevor, and Trevor said Andrew should do it also, and so Doug was pissed at Jordan and smacked his racket against the ground. Then when he got outside he threw it against the wall and had this pissed as hell look on his face. Jordan said he had just gotten that racket, and it was completely totalled. He had snapped part of the frame completely in half, and he was pissed during the whole camp. He kept getting angry at me also because I always talk to Andrew when he's explaining stuff, and he was getting really mad at me. During team singles my team was the best team at the camp, we only lost one game, at the top court, but we won the next game, and didn't lose after that one loss.  I bought Hot Fuss by The Killers, it's pretty freaking sweet, it's like indie-pop/power-pop/alt-rock-ish and pretty awesome. They aren't as good as The Strokes or Maroon 5, but I'd say they are just a few rungs under those guys, and since those are two of my favorite bands right now that's saying alot.  People have been telling me who they like recently and I don't like knowing that type of stuff. I don't like keeping secrets and stuff, and although it hasn't happened recently, but sometimes someone will tell me who they like, and it'll be the same person I like, and even though I've never and will never have a chance with any girl, it still is a sucky feeling.  Playing tennis outside for two hours four days this week has burned me to a crisp. My arms and face are totally red, and I'm not happy about how bad I know they're gonna peel in a few days. But it's my fault for not using sun screen, but that's ok cus sunscreen is for the weak, and I'd like to think I'm no weakling.  My new addiction is Yahoo! Grafitti. It's like online pictionary and it's just about the funnest thing in the world. Also it's great cus noone can make fun of you for how you look cus they can't see you. And it's great when I win (I win alot, I'm pretty damn good, ask megan k) and tell them they lost to a fat fourteen year old.  I feel like a totally different person then I was at the beginning of the summer. I like totally different music, I play a sport, I'm less fat, the list goes on and on, but I feel different and it's weird. I don't think anyone really knows what I mean (cept maybe Kameron G.) because all of you people who read this are skinny, athletic, popular people which is like a polar opposite to fat, unathletic, not too popular Sam.  I'm finally getting my bass tomorrow. It's been put off again and again and again but it's finally gonna happen. I'm really really happy about it too. Cus chicks like guys who play cool rock n roll instruments, so now I'll play one and girls won't hate me as much, actually it probablly won't have any effect on that but whatever.  Now we need one of my rants, because everybody loves a good rant today I will rant on the evil MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America)  This is one of the most evil groups on the planet, they are made up of a bunch of studio execs who don't care about the independent filmmaker, and only care about the bottom line (profit). MPAA might as well stand for Motherfucking Pricks Against America, because they only look out for the select few while many many good filmmakers are struggling to get by. They want to get rid of any way an idependent filmmaker can get his movie out to the public, they are trying to get rid of DVD-r's because some people make illegal copies of dvds. If they did this independent filmmakers would have no way to get their product out because they wouldn't be able to make a sellable dvd. Also Mr. Winkler is probablly a member of them, and he is a shit head.  Has anyone noticed how cool that Linkin Park video for Breakin the Habit is? It's directed by the same guy who directed the story of O-Ren-Ishii in Kill Bill, and both of their style of animation is freaking unreal, but in a good way. Ugh... there's a secret I'm keeping that is killing me (not literally, it's not like I have a brain tumor or something) but ugh..... it's really bothering me, but I can't tell anyone cus I don't trust anyone enough. (not cus you people are untrustworthy but I'm paranoid about stuff cus I'm so used to people saying stuff about me behind my back, like fat jokes and stuff) Ahhhhh it pisses me off it's like bottled up inside and I really need to get it out!!! Damnit Damnit Damnit!!!! Ok.... That's all for today............. Yeahhhh

      Today was the average summer day so yeah......  I woke up at 10:30 and had some tofu for breakfast, I like that stuff more and more every day I eat it. I had a tennis camp today so I was pretty much playing from 11:30-4 and I'm worn out as hell. But I gotta get a date to homecoming so this is part of that process of getting skinny and getting a date.  I had two propels when I was there, those are like my new favorite drink they are so freaking awesome.  I did a lot of thinking today, cus I played basketball for about an hour, and I don't want to sound gay by humming maroon 5 songs while I play so all I have are my thoughts. I was thinking about what I want to do with my blog during the school year, my goal is to get it as one of the banned sites on the OSD computers. So that means you guys have to go on it at school and leave plenty of swear laden comments. I just think that would be fucking awesome as hell to be like, my site got banned by my school district. So that's what all you people who read this have to do as a way of repaying me for writing this. Hehehe, that'd be cool if they called me in and were like Sam your site is bad, and  you are evil, and you're going to hell, and if you ever go to it while at school again we'll suspend you. I'd be like hell yeah hell yeah cus that would be freaking awesome!!! So ok everyone, tell me on aim or something if you'll help me do it, cus I'll post so much of the funny shit that happens at school. hehehe getting this banned would be so unbelievablyfreakinghotcousinawesome, that's a real word btw it's on dictionary.com!  I played pretty well in tennis but I was so worn out by the end that if I won in Olympic singles I wouldn't even try to get to the other side of the net. It was quite a pathetic site to see. But I sweated a bunch so I probablly lost a bunch of water weight.  I went to this asian restaurant and got rice with veggies and stuff it was pretty damn good, cus my mom didn't want to cook cus it was so hot today. My arms aren't so pale anymore, but the getting a little tan brings out tons and tons of freckles on my arms.  This next paragraph or two will be dedicated to my favorite movie of this year, and probablly one of my favorites that has come out this year. That movie is Dawn of the Dead, it's gory, sexual, swear laced, black comedy, horror movie, and it's awesome. Its about this plague type of thing that makes everyone into zombies, and a few people escape and end up inside this mall, that's the only place with food and shelter where they can be safe from zombies. I will list some of my favorite parts, in no particular order.  When they take golf clubs to the roof of the mall they're hiding in and start pegging zombies in the head with the balls, hehehe!  Also when on the roof they take guns up and start shooting zombies that look like celebrities.  When they are on an escelator and happy music is playing even though the whole world is dying off.  They are watching this news show, and this hick is like telling about how you have to shoot em in the head, and sometimes they wiggle around for awhile so you gotta make sure you finish em off.  It's just an overall awesome movie, and everyone needs to see it. Oh and this clip where this one guy is doing it with the hot girl in the middle of some random store. So get the dvd release when it comes out in October, and check out the original one, which is a low budget horror classic if ya ask me.  Remember gotta get this thing banned at school. Ok that's all for today, peace out.

      I've noticed readership of this has gone down, at least I think it has. So before I summarize my day I'm gonna throw out a few ideas for new things to do daily on this blog.  1. Porn reviews, me and David thought that since not many girls probablly read this (cus honestly what girl cares about a fat kid's day to day life!) that porn reviews would be funny as hell. Like at the bottom of every entry do something like *Insert porn name here* is a 10/10 pornographic masterpiece and even people who hate porn should check it out.  2. Shut this thing down. Maybe people are getting bored and the dream is over, I could probablly spend the countless hours I've been writing in this working out and losing weight.  3. Make every post a weird rant. Like have a rant like I'm some fundamentalist christian, and have it be all pro life, pro war, anti gay thing, and then the next one be like a psycho liberal. Yeah that's a really dumb idea, don't even consider it as a possibility.  4. Keep it the same, every once in a while some of the stuff I write is entertaining to someone. Like the unfuckingbelievablyhot14yearoldcousin thing which david and me both got a laugh out of.  Ok now in other news... Not alot happened today, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna alot.  Today August 8th is the aniversary of my uncles death he died in 1994 just a few months after my dad, it was a very sad year that year, and that's why i hate years that end in four including this year. So everyone who has a drink today pour out a little liquor for my dead homie, my uncle William.  I've been listening to The Strokes all day and they haven't gotten any less kick assy than they were yesterday. I decided I wanted to lose a pound today and I'm pretty sure I was able to.  I ate really healthy today eating rice, tofu, and a hard boiled egg. I worked out a bunch today. I did weights played basketball for about an hour, and played tennis for an hour. So I at least probablly lost some water weight because I've only had a few cups of water, and a Propel when I was at the Valley.  When I was playing tennis there was a hot girl on the court next to me, but when I looked closer I noticed that I had been fooled into thinking she was hot by her body, but she had the weirdest fucking fourhead ever, it was all bony and stuff. And I bet before she has sex whoever her partner is will make her put a bag over her head so he can pretend she's some one else during the intercourse. But she did have a great body so she gets some props for that.  I played relatively well during tennis,  I was making the majority of my serves, but I was just missing something today that kept me from playing up to what my A game is. I was going to go to this picnic for my mom's office but it sounded like a waste of time so I just hung out at home, and that was all good.  I played a bunch of basketball today and every time I play I notice my shots getting more and more consistent which is really cool to see. Then I watched some SportsCenter, it's old school week, and when they were re-capping a game and a guy hit a home run Kraig Killborn said "Jumanji!!!" It was the funniest thing I've heard all day. The old school look of sports center is way better then the modernized/stylized look they use for normal broadcasts.  I'm a vegetarian now, I don't remember if I told you guys that yet, but I'm thinking this is my key to weightloss success. I'm getting my bass tomorrow so expect a lengthy post about going to Seattle to get it, and all the attractive women I'm bound to see on the way there.  Oh yeah RIP Rick James, that guy was crazy. I was watching behind the music on him and he was out of control. He'd smoke joints on stage, and then like he'd have a bunch of women in his room and be like you come with me, you wait here for afterwards, you come back tomorrow, you wait for if I want some more after the second girl. Shit this guy was getting more pussy than um...i can't think of anything better than someone who owns a lot of cats, but you get the picture. Rick James you will be missed.

       Well yesterday was kind of a mixed bag, I got good news and bad news, but before I get into that I'm going to get into other stuff.  I found out something awesome today, the original Dawn of the Dead is getting a new collectors edition on dvd. It's a four disc set with three different cuts of the movie, with three seprate commentaries, and a fourth disc that has some documentaries about the making of the film. This is an excellent movie and a zombie-horror classic. It's about four people who go to a mall for shelter when zombies begin taking over the world. It's alot different from the high-budget remake that came out earlier this year. There's more humor in the original one, and the mall is more like the type of mall we have, not a huge two story mall like in the remake. I'm getting really excited for it's September 7th release, and I'm gonna make everyone watch it because of it's greatness. It'll be a good appetizer for the October release of the Dawn of the Dead remake's special unrated directors cut, that I'll be buying the day its released.  I had my sports physical yesterday, and it's really not fun. I got good news while I was there, I had lost more weight than I thought, and I have 20/20 vision in both eyes, which is pretty sweet. However there was some really really really crappy news that most of you already know, I have been diagnosed with the horrible disease of asthma. I'm still cleared for tennis, but this news is making me really depressed, and it sucks, and I'm pissed off at whoever gave it to me. I know it's not the end of the world, but it's one more thing that'll make tennis hard, and yeah it sucks.  After being at the doctors for two hours I finally got to go to tennis, although I wasn't trying very hard, when we spent the lesson playing singles with serving I ended up winning most of my games and tying with a few other people for second place overall. But I did lose to this one annoying ass kid named Willy, who's this fat bitch, and a sore loser and a PAB (one of me and Lucas Zucker's inside jokes) I was really embarassed to be defeated by him, he has a hot sister though. I also decided that one of those fake preppy girls named Gretchen isn't too bad when her friends aren't around, it was just her yesterday, and overall she was a not too bad person.  I went and got Cooper's present today at the mall, but I can't say what it is, cus that would ruin the surprise. But then me and my mom couldn't find any decent cards and so I had to get this really really retarded one, that's really retarded, but was the least retarded of the ones there, and I even wrote something to that effect on the card.  I need to go school shopping at the mall, but I don't want to go with my mom, so if there's anyone that wants go hang out at the mall with a fat kid, then tell me cus I need to go school shopping but it'd be embarassing being at the mall by myself, so yeah people we should go to the mall and hang out, and shop and stuff.  I found this hillarious thing on the internet, it's new lyrics to the Milkshake song, and it's pretty darned funny. Here it is     "      my pokeman bring all the nerds to the yard, and there like, do you wanna trade cards, damn right, lets trade some cards, ill trade you, but not my charizard" Hehehe it's pretty funny I think, but I have a stupid and juvenile sense of humor, that many people find offensive and unfunny, especially when I make all those fun fat jokes, that girls just don't seem to understand.  I found a new favorite show recently, it's one of the only shows to make me laugh out loud even when I'm by myself it's called Trigger Happy Tv. It has the funniest skits, like one was the "Orangatangagram" and a guy goes into a store with a person dressed in Orangatang costume and says "someone has sent you this orangatang, It'll stay for three days and then leave, don't worry it feeds itself" and then he leaves and the person in the store has no idea what the hell is going on and then the orangatang just sits down in the middle of the store, and that's the end of it, but it's really weird funny stuff like that, and its made in England, and its on Comedy Central sometimes, but doesn't have a real schedule or anything.  That's all for today, cus today and yesterday were pretty boring aside from that whole asthma debacle.

      So much to write about, actually not really but I'll find stuff, and take up tons and tons and tons and tons of room.  Everyone's been giving me the cold shoulder lately, noones really wanted to talk to me, and I don't know what I freaking did. Some of it's probablly cus of making lots of fat jokes, but jesus christ people you need to get over it. I mean come on it doesn't hurt anybody, the worst thing that happens is I don't have much self esteem, and can't talk to girls, but honestly why the frick does that matter. It's not like I'm making fun of things wrong with other people, just myself, so people take a break on all of the inspirational crap like, you're not sooo fat and stuff I don't need to hear it. It'd be a lot easier for you to just laugh with me, instead of yell at me. And if you get mad at me for making fat jokes then I'll never talk to you again, not like you'll care but whatever.  I found the two sweetest magazines ever when I went to Barnes n Noble the other day. They are two awesome film magazines. One is called Empire, and it's made in the UK, so it costs 10 bucks cus they have to import it, but it's worth it because it's so freaking awesome. The other is Independent Film-maker, and it's about Independent filmmaking of course. It's full of awesome reviews of new indie films on dvd and in theatres, (not the ones around here, but the ones in LA and New York that show independent films) and there's a super sweet interview with the guys who made the new metallica documentary Some Kind Of Monster, which looks pretty awesome. It's about the making of their newest cd St. Anger, but in it there's stuff like when they had therapy sessions, and auditioning for a bassist and stuff like that. Empire is full of sweet reviews of lots of the Hollywood stuff, but also lots of European films. Theres also a great article on the worlds best method actor ever, Marlon Brando. They did mess up on their review of his last movie though, they gave The score 2 stars, when it's easilly a 4 star movie. There was a really sweet picture in Empire of this japanese guy who's all bloody with a pistol to his head, and also since it's british they say fags, but it means cigarettes, but it's still funny.  The Lamberts are moving to Longview, which sucks I guess, Kyel was always mean to me, and Kasey made a lot of fat jokes, but I know a lot of people are gonna miss them, so that sucks for those people. I'm gonna miss all of the random acts of violence that those two have been involved in, so yeah.  I've been listening to some sweet tunes lately. I downloaded a whole bunch of Led Zeppelin, and my favorite of their songs is Black Dog, I would go buy their cd's but I'm waiting till I have the 120 dollars so I can buy the boxset, which looks pretty sweet. I also downloaded some Iron Maiden, which is pretty cool, but a little too satanic for me, and some AC/DC which I'm starting to like alot, but is also a little on the satanic side. For now, at least, I'll probablly just stick to my power-pop like Phantom Planet, and Rooney, before I try and get into the really hard rock like Iron Maiden.  I finally got my bass, and it's just freaking awesomer then hell. It's a red Spector OL4 or 5 (I don't remember which one.) I got a sweet amp too, and it was awesome. We got it up at Bass Northwest in Seattle, that's the place where Karl got his, and they were really helpfull in finding me a bass. I like my amp too it's not really great, but it has distortion which is fun to mess around with. I started taking lessons from this guy named John who works at Yenney's, he's pretty cool, but the bass is hard to learn. One of these days I'll be really good, and then I'll be in a super cool band, and I'll make millions.  Tennis has been a lot of fun lately. I've gotten so much better this summer. Today we were playing team singles, and me and Riley were really good, but we got a bunch of sucky girls on our team, so me and Riley had to completely dominate, and we did, and the only time our team was losing points was when Jordan made us go out because we had been in for like 10 points. It was pretty cool though, but I was totally worn out. There are so many really rich, fake, stuck up people in that class and it's really annoying. And all of the bitchy girls, who are hot, but have a personality about as good as a piece of dog crap. They are really annoying, and they cheat, and are sore losers. They also think that the world revolves around them. The worst part though is when after you lose a point to them they say nice try, or something along those lines, when you know they don't mean it, and are just saying it to cover up what a real bitch they actually are. Sorry about that but they just piss me off to no end. And they always seem really happy when they beat me in singles, it's like nice work you beat a fat kid, who moves about as fast as a beached whale, bravo. And it's not like I could tell them off because their superficiality works on some of the other rich stuck-up kids, and those kids would kick my ass. Most of the tennis class people aren't too bad, but the people like that make every day really shitty. Oh yeah there names are Gretchen and Marta, so if you know them tell em that the fat kid from tennis thinks they are both annoying bitches.  I played tennis with dylan today it was a lot of fun, but on the way into the capital court my shoe got caught on the spinny door and I pulled it off and it gave me a two inch long cut in my ankle. It bled all over my sock and shoe, and my sock is now ruined becasue the whole back part is bloody. I played pretty well, we're both at about the same level, but I couldn't serve most of the time because the sun was so bad. The football players were hillarious, cus they were getting yelled at, and doing weird runs with like skipping and stuff. And during their jumping jacks they spelled Cougars a bunch of times.  I haven't eaten anything today because I had a bunch of crappy food yesterday night at Karl's house, like mexican food, a hotpocket, and two sodas, and a bunch of chex mix so I figured I'd burn that fat today by playing tennis and not eating, and I think it worked. I guess that's annorexia but since I'm only doing it today it's ok, but if this works then maybe I'll make the annorexia full time, because until it kills me it'll be sweet to be skinny. It goes something like this. I call this the Annorexia Flow Chart. 1. I stop eating and work out way more. 2. Still fat, and hating being annorexic cus fat kids like to eat 3. Best shape of my life, I'm in shape, and losing a bunch of weight, and maybe even have a gf. 4. I'm the size of Lisa and David Hopper, but still feeling good. 5. I'm dangerously malnutritioned, and then I die.  I think that 3 and 4 would make being anorexic worth it, but then I wouldn't get to eat, and I like to eat (it's pretty obvious, isn't it?)  I watched Predator last night it was pretty sweet. It's about Arnold Schw...I'm not even gonna try, goes into this jungle type of place with his army guys to rescue hostages, and they kill all the bad guys, but then they get hunted by the Predator, which is this crazy alien monster. It chases them on there way to this helicoptor and it's invisible and gets everyone but Arnold and this one girl. It's cool how it kills people it exploded one guys head, and exploded this other guys stomach, and is really sweet. Arnold eventually sets up a bunch of booby traps and finally kills it, and then it explodes like an atomic bomb, but somehow Arnold is ok, and he escapes and meets the girl at the helicoptor. I'd say it's pretty good for an Arnold movie, it's no Oscar Winner but it had lots of action and cool explosions, so I guess it did what it was supposed to do.  I've been watching the Olympics boxing religiously it's so great. I love the amaetur scoring, where it's a point for every clean hit in the head or body, it rewards players for being a good boxer, not for cheap blows and knock out punches like in the pros. Some of the really light classes are boring, but middle weight and up is a lot of fun to watch. Tennis is ok too, but they don't have as many of the top players because they are so tired from all of the tournaments they've been in this year. And basketball just plain sucks, none of the good players want to be in the Olympics cus they're too tired from the season, and then there's Kobe with his extra-marital shennanigans which keep him in the  court room, instead of the basketball court. Some of the girls gymnastic people are hot, but they are so muscly, it's intimidating.  I also saw some of the woman's weight lifting, and the ones with short hair could have passed for men, I swear to god, but there was this really funny section of fans from thailand that had really weird clothes and stuff and they were cheering like it was a real sport.  That's about all for today, and everyone listen to led zeppelin cus they are the bomb, and my new favorite band. Listen to Immigrant Song, Black Dog, Kashmir, and of course Stairway to Heaven, cus those are my favorites, and they totally kick ass.OK that's it!!!
