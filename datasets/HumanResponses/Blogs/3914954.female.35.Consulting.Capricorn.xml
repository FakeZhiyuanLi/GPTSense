      Last night I watched the news (which is not something I do often) and I have to say I was appalled. Appalled at the way teenagers in this country are portrayed.   Firstly, there was the naming of the schoolboy killer – Alan Pennell, a 16-year-old who killed Luke Walmsley. Now, while this is a horrific tragedy, the branding of a 16-year-old as evil shocks me to the core. We are so quick to blame; surely the questions we should ask are, What made a 16-year-old go to these lengths to be heard? Were the adults around Alan aware of the conflict emerging between him and Luke? Why was there no adequate intervention? What are we doing as a society?  &nbsp;But no, we go into a moral panic and the media brands a child as evil.  Then to top it all, eleven teenagers were given an anti-social behaviour order – eleven teenagers branded as criminals because they had nothing better to do. Now believe me, I have dealt with teenagers like this for over 10 years, so I am not looking at this with rose-tinted glasses and I do not in any way condone the behaviour, but is this the answer? What are we doing to our youths today?  And then, if you just were not convinced that the word teenager meant the Anti-Christ, a whole report dealing with how our teenagers are sexually promiscuous and spreading diseases.  In thirty minutes, we as a country had firmly told the world that the word teenager = bad. Is it any wonder that they behave that way?

      As I sit here feeling very sorry for myself, (I’ve got a cold) I am reflecting on the week gone by.  I spent three hours with a leading TV media company the other day, speaking about two forthcoming projects – this was very exciting, something I have dreamed of for a long time. I went there all prepared, thinking that I was looking my best, only to come out after the meeting, look in the mirror to see that not only was I having a very bad hair day, I also had a piece of bread between my teeth. Will I ever learn? Look in the mirror first!  &nbsp;I got to hand a media opportunity over to Dan, one of my team, this week. That felt so good, finally not having to bear all the burdens, and now someone else knows how I feel. He called me after and said that it was so scary. All I could say in reply was,  &nbsp;“Welcome to my world!” Tee-hee!

      I have to tell you about the people who are doing my Show reel they are amazing.  &nbsp;  Now you know how this was a huge step for me and the difficulties I am having with it well they have made it so easy  &nbsp;  Here is the response  &nbsp;  “10 mins is good Sarah.&nbsp; If you make sure those 10 mins are easy to find you could leave it up to us to decide which bits should be included and in which order? We’ll send you through a copy to check before sending the finalised one – then if there’s anything you’re not happy with we can change it for you…”  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  So easy and helpful  &nbsp;  Horary for http://www.pozitiv.com/&nbsp; &nbsp;

      One of my ex-clients wives has just contacted me letting me know that Ken (my ex-client has suddenly died). He was only mid forties and was preparing to be a coach.  &nbsp;Please join me in our thoughts and prayers for this devastated family.

      I am of the firm belief that if you want to build your coaching business take a holiday! Since been back I have two new clients, two people signed up for our coach training and three media opportunities in the pipeline. It always amazes me – up to London tomorrow to pitch at two Media companies.  &nbsp;  My show reel is well and truly on the way although getting over 6 hours of tape down to 3 minutes is proving a challenge…..  &nbsp;  I sometimes wake up and want to jump up and down I cannot believe my luck. &nbsp;  Talk about asking and you shall receive.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today I went to see Blood Brothers at the Theatre it was amazing…made me very sad though and yet again got me thinking about the choices that we make as teens and where they lead us in later life. Got me thinking about what the most important decision I made, as a teen was I am still thinking.  Today started strangely with Eddie running an hour behind time without realising despite my many attempts to tell him what time it was…I tell you men.  Got to watch myself on The Stress Test it either was not that bed or I have just got use to seeing myself more on TV – who knows – what were your thoughts?

      Today I did something very brave – I contacted someone about a show reel – while on the surface it does not appear much believe me it is.  I have an agent who wants to meet me and I am petrified to say the least despite the constant pushes from my coach to get this done it has taken me over two months to pluck up the courage.  Big step – lets see what happens now.

      1.	I like the sun 2.	I like holidays in Europe – previously I only choose the States 3.	I like to plan – this one was not and stressed me out 4.	I need more than coaching in my life 5.	I love doing nothing – wonder if I can get paid for it 6.	I want more of an Internet based business – watch this space. 7.	Life is better without TV – watch out kids….. 8.	The Tuscan way of life suits me 9.	I was born to have a tan 10.	I have lots of things I don’t need- how could I ever wear 100 pair of shoes…   Today I get the feeling life will never be the same again…Talk about under the Tuscan Sun.  Sarah

      So here I am back from Tuscany - ho hum....  I left blue skies a palace I was living in and the freedom to do as I please....  I learnt so much in Tuscany though.  I love the way of life it is so simple and easy, I will be looking at how I can incorporate more of this into my life.  So look out I may not be able to answer your e-mails as I am having a siesta.

      Well another great week, made all the better by spending a few days on my Dad’s canal boat. Two things make this special. Firstly, the fact that I get to spend time with my Dad after his life-threatening brain haemorrhage and secondly, I get to slow down and see what is important about life; being present with the people that matter.  So who do you need to slow down and be present with this week?
