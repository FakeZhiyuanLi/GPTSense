      i'm listening to sondre lerche, i'm still a little sullen that i didn't get to see him at slims, but i guess that happens when you're havinga war with your phone. no questions. my fingers are looking rather red today, can't quite explain.   there was a time, late after school two years ago, i was preparing for my 8th grade play, school had ended at this time, three weeks of designing the set, rehersing dances and lines. the whole production was on us, the 8th graders, with very minimal help. I was set desginer i think, but no one would listen to me because i was always telling them what to do, which was why only half the set was good, after a while they got fed up of me. rather, i got fed up with them and decided to go join john in the light booth. a small room, balcony-like overlooking the gym and theater. we stayed up there a lot working out the lighting. i got to use the cherry picker to put up the coloured lights. nathalie came one night while we were all putting the stage together, she tried to order us pizzas. no one would deliver to 40 hungery 8th graders, they thought we were joking. i got mad and yelled at them on the phone, it was pretty funny. and the final night, when we rolled tape back and forth on the stage when the action was else where, some kids were caught drinking afterward, which is where the story ends.

      Um... i was using my old computer earlier today, now that I think about it I'm not quite sure why I was using it since it's missing a keyboard and all. But I found all these wonderful Hitch hickers Guide to the Galexy quotes, so.... they are as follows... (if you haven't read these books yet you must....must must must, they are hilarious and beautiful all wrapped up in one, although there are actually 5 books... but ONE!!!)  "ladies and gentelmen" he said, "the Universe as we know it has been in existance for over one hundred and seventy thousand million billions years and will be ending in a little over half an hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant and the End of the Universe!"    Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of horror, he was suddenly  in a terrifically good mood.   "The  point  is,  you  see," said Ford, "that there is no point in driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might just as well give in and save your sanity for later."   These mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. they are merly the protrusion into our dimension of vastly hyperintelligent pandimensional beings. The whole business with cheese and the sqeaking is just a front. They've been expiirementing on you, i'm afraid.   "The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with a particularly  sickening thud this morning."   now, either you give yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possible one or two others we noticed on our way out here!    He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind  was  busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off.   "The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and  miss."  He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were all torn and worn through.   "I may," he added with a grin which would have sent  sane  men  scampering into trees, "have been imagining it."   Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway so i don't know why I bother to say it, oh God, I'm so depressed   "My  doctor  says  that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and that I  am  therefore excused from saving Universes."   It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. For instance, on the planet earth, man has always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much more-the wheel, New York, wars and so on- while all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent that man- for presisely the same reasons.   Very  few things  actually  get  manufactured these days, because in an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in which  we  live,  most  things  one could  possibly  imagine,  and  a  lot  of  things  one would rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was discovered recently in which most of  the  trees  grew ratchet  screwdrivers as fruit. The life cycle of ratchet screwdriver fruit it quite interesting. Once picked it needs a dark dusty drawer in  which  it  can lie  undisturbed  for  years. Then one night it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into dust, and emerges as a  totally  unidentifiable little  metal  object with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows what it is supposed  to  gain  from  this.  Nature,  in  her  infinite  wisdom,  is presumably working on it.   the girl he had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him dearly over the last hour,and it would pobably have been a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be too busy evaporating herself to notice.   Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now.

       The Execution of All Things   Soldiers come quickly, I feel the earth beneath my feet. I’m feeling badly, it’s not an attempt at decency. And if you’re well off, well then I’m happy some for you. But I’d rather not celebrate my defeat and humiliation here with you.  Someone come quickly, this place was built for moving out. Leave behind buildings, the city planners got mapped out. Bring with you history, and make your hard earned feast. Then we’ll go to Omaha to work and exploit the booming music scene and humility.  And we’ve been talking all night….  Oh god come quickly, the execution of all things. Let’s start with the bears and the air and mountains, rivers, and streams. Then we’ll murder what matters to you and move on to your neighbors and kids. Crush all hopes of happiness with disease ‘cause of what you did.  And lastly, you’re all alone with nothing left but sleep. But sleep never comes to you, it’s just the guilt and forever wakefulness of  the weak. It’s just you and me….   The execution of all things. The execution of all things. The execution of all things.   A Better Son/Daughter   Sometimes in the morning I am petrified and can't move Awake but cannot open my eyes And the weight is crushing down on my lungs I know I can't breathe And hope someone will save me this time And your mother's still calling you insane and high Swearing it's different this time And you tell her to give in to the demons that possess her And that god never blessed her insides Then you hang up the phone and feel badly for upsetting things And crawl back into bed to dream of a time When your heart was open wide and you love things just because Like the sick and dying  And sometimes when you're on  You're really fucking on And your friends they sing along And they love you But the lows are so extreme That the good seems fucking cheap And it teases you for weeks in its absence But you'll fight and you'll make it through You'll fake it if you have to And you'll show up for work with a smile And you'll be better You'll be smarter More grown up and a better daughter or son And a real good friend And you'll be awake You'll be alert You'll be positive though it hurts And you'll laugh and embrace all of your friends And you'll be a real good listener You'll be honest You'll be brave You'll be handsome and you'll be beautiful You'll be happy  Your ship may be coming in You're weak but not giving in To the cries and the wails of the valley below Your ship may be coming in You're weak but not giving in And you'll fight it you'll go out fighting all of them

      Weee! you can always tell when I've got too much time on my hands, I start making different layouts every day. I'm not too fond of this one, meaning I will probably change it by the end of the day. The grey and purple is nice, it's just.... too simple. I'm having huge cravings to go back to having a real webpage, a real real one, but I dunno, I think I wont have enough time for it when I go back to school. Okay, let me rephase that, I don't want to spend my time on a webpage because then I will never do my homework, and my goal for this quarter is to actaully  care  about my school work, meaning actually doing my homework at home and dun dun dun, studying for tests. I don't know how long that theology will work, but I'm willing to give it a try. I'm just tired of sitting through class and not listening, not doing the work and getting mediocre grades, it really fucking pisses me off sometimes. School really does matter, since I've got nothing else I'd better start trying in school. meh, I hate being acountable sometimes. In other news, I'm going to make money tonight, I'm going to make money tonight. i'm dancing, can you imagine? I desperately need money and now I'm going to get like 60 dollars tonight. Yippe! I love my neighbors, I really do. Some say babysitting is a lost cause, i say... money!!!!

      it's justs about to be 2:00 AM, i'm not looking foawrd to that, I never look foward to that. Generally, or so I have noticed, if i haven't fallen asleep, or am profoundly tired by 2:00 i wont fall asleep until 5 or 6. and that's not a good thing. I'm really going to have to fix myself before school starts again, i'm pretty sure they expect me to keep my head off the desk, although I don't think they need much more than that. eh, oh well. I'm about to go get up and put some sigur-ros on and hopefully fall into a nice sound sleep. As much as I'm not really tired right now, I think I'll be able to sleep, it's just a hunch. but in the meantime... sigur-ros.

      Okay, I was talking with Geary about normal, or maybe "normal" was just mentioned briefly, but I remembered an essay I wrote about "normal" and normallities. of course the essay was written of my own accord. Meaning I wrote it during the countless boring hours locked up in school, mostly geometry class, but was never exactly assigned by any teacher. I really wish the teachers would assign exciting projects, if they let me write, or somehow incorperate art (any form of art really) into what we were learning or as I often say "learning" i know everything said in all my classes. Except of course Pre-Cal and French, but I'm not even supposed to be in those classes. Anyway, now that I've gone on a nice long tangent about hating school and how useless it is, I'll write down my essay on normallity. I couldn't find the final version of it, but the one i did find is close enough, I'll just change it as I write. I always change my mind mid-sentance anyway which is why i'll end with some thoughts of panda bears, like the one sitting above my computer. Okay, that's enough of my slander for now.  The perfectness of normallity has and will continue to show itself in true forms that it has never shown itself in before. Normal is not a stock character, it can't be thrown around to describe others. No one is normal, yet everyone has normalities in their lives, and that normality is what brings comfort, what brings sadness. Everyone lives and breathes from their normality while they deny it exists. There is no normal, yet norms are implied in almost every situation. Social norms, who do they dictate to, who fits their selective role. When gathered in a group, similar or not, there are always going to be some forms of matching normalities. Perhaps that is the norm in that group. But social norms dictate to whole societies, but they have yet to be defined. In this socicty what is normal, what is expected, the prevailing question remains, what are our social norms? Is the same thing really expected from every person in socitey with no preface to possible personal talents or flaws.  um... i went on for awhile about that, then i kinda changed the direction of the essay to something more personal. it's not all that great so i wont waste any more of my time or yours, frankly i'm pretty surprised you've made it this far. anyway, maybe another time in another paradoxal universe i'll write out the rest and complete my thought. i'm notorious for leaving things unfinished, i just get too distracted with something else, i love beginnings, i have trouble with the middle and endings just come to fast. i need to work on that, and i will, as soon as my feet heat up.

      digital camera wonderment!!! i went to the beach with geary today. see...the sea.  see the sea! i have too much fun with words sometimes. here's geary in the ocean. j'adore geary.   Then this was me coming home on the bus. well, the picture isn't of me, it's actually a picture of trees and well... you can see for yourself right? ahuh. i just thought it looked nice. i remembered how to take pictures in black and white on my camera today, so i went crazy with glee.   Then I just have too much fun with photoshop. i was bored and crying and felt like turning the flower orange, or something like that.   and now to scare off all my stalkers here's a picture of me. i was waiting at the bus stop forever and this little old lady kept staring at me. i started taking pictures of her then ran away. in my mind i was really hoping that she would chase after me waving her cane, but she didn't. :(

      I'm melting away into nothing, a mere ghost of what I once was. And who is this typing at the keys, most certaintly not me, I was lost some where in the subway, maybe never to return. I'm eating myself from the inside, something in me has died.

      I remember a time when i would run around and pat everyone slowly on the back saying 'there there, there there" i don't know when i stopped doing that, i only know that i don't anymore. I hate it how you never notice when something is fading out of your life, but as soon as it's completely gone you realize it's gone. It's like cold water being poured on your face early early in the morning. WAKE UP SLEEPY HEAD I have a feeling that I will never get to sleep tonight. It's already 4 in the morning, i never meant to stay awake this late, my insomnia really is getting worse. I'm hope I can still force myself to fall asleep tonight (meaning this morning... but who's counting?) i've tried just about everything. I rolled around for awhile, but that just made me more anxious. so then i tried to liy starfish style and clear my mind. I almost thought that was going to work until I realized I was both standing up and only had one sock on. I don't really know how i got out of bed or why I did because it's ice cold out, but somehow i was. I also tried Geary's rock idea. I am rocks.... yes, that didn't work so well, i kept imagining an ocean wearing me away, it made me even more tired, but still unable to fall asleep. i kept my eyes closed for awhile too, i imagined a clear sky. perfectly clear, nota single cloud. That was going pretty well until I realized that I still only had one sock on. I hurridly took the other sock off so that now I am at least even. I really just want to fall asleep. Sleep would be ideal right now. You've got no idea how envious I am of everyone who is alseep right now, I wish more than annything that I could join then, metaphysically of course. My arms are starting to freeze, I'm sure that if i could see them in the light that they would have goose bumps, but it's pretty dark in here, the only light is that of the light of my computer screen. White light bouncng and reflecting off of every other plane in here. I think on my little car adventure i'm going to track down some dramamine tomorrow, or some other kind of sedative. I really really need to start sleeping. This morning I almost passed out. I've been eating almost every half hour during the day to give myself enough energy so I can stand up without feeling light headed. It's not a feeling I  particularily want to keep around. Besides, eating that much just leaves me feeling grossly full and sick. Speaking of feeling sick I really hope i'm not coming down with phnemonia or something. I was sitting out in the rain for awhile the other day when it was raining out. I've got an interesting cough now, I'm hoping it's gone tomorrow. It probably will be, well, my body would heal itself if it could sleep, but i'm finding that harder and harder to do. Maybe I'll turn the TV on and close my eyes and hope the late night TV sounds will soothe my into sleep. Either that or i take a bottle full of tylonol and sleep, no, I wouldn't do that. But i will say goodnight and PRAY to god (although i don't believe, i'm pretending i do for the sake are argument) that I can get some sleep. bon nuit.

      sigh. i was trying to fall asleep but failed. i want to wake up quasi early but i doubt i will. i want to get away from it all, from everyone. i found the keys to my car today, i might go for a long long drive tomorrow. i know i don't have my license yet but i need to get away from here, i need to get away from my mental state. i'm poisoning myself. i just wish things could be like before. but i don't know if they were any better then, i don't know if i was any better. i just need to get away and get my head clear. i don't know if i'll actually go threw with driving off. i don't see any problems unless i park my car in a different spot then were my mom did, she'd probably notice, i'd have no excuse, no possible explanation. i've head that if you haven't slept in 72 hours that in court you are considered mentaly insane. does that mean i'm insane, i think i'm just mentally unstable. maybe i should stop thinking. i need to get out of here.

      I was a bit bored and reading through my notebook(grey) and i found this quasi poem thing. and since i've got no life and obviously love posting here WAY too much i've decided to type it up and post it here. so read, or don't read. so i'll leave you with this, and leave a comment please :) je t'aime  Where will it go When the morning ends When the beginning has no longer begun Before the end, should there be one Should there be bubbles on the bus, will the clock stop ticking Will the life stop living And so just sit here and take my hand It will all be better soon I know where the evening goes And that's when I learned my lesson, my lesson of life Nothing has to repeat itself, choose your own future Just because you’re your own writer Doesn't mean you can make your characters do whatever you please The story is a collaboration of a collective Because everyone is self taught, an inner knowledge  But a splendid time is deserved, and written once in awhile So sing what you want, can you hear me now Feel me now, this is part of a story, a shadow of a sunset And where will you go, where will you lead your story Where will you lead yourself when you're given the chance A loud sound of awakening, hello, come dance It’s a life now, a newborn hatchling learning to soar Run before you walk, will they ever be right? Will I ever have sight.

      how about loooooove, measure in love. seasons of love.... and the song goes on. some how a showtune found it's way onto my hippie music cd. am i singing along.. yes, yes i am. i love that no one can hear me out here. i can listen to music loudly and sing along and no one will loose their hearing due to my bad voice. heh, high note, it's obvious i haven't sung in awhile. i'm kinda paranoid at the moment, i keep hearing things outside. tick tock, i am the clock. show tunes followed by the smiths.. wonderful, wonderful, i'm dancing in bed. but i really am paranoid. something is moving around outside, it's probably just my bunny. lovely connie, i should bring her in here and cuddle with her. j'adore ma lapin (i'm not usre if that's how you spell rabbit, but i'm hoping i'm right) or it could be that stray cat in my neighborhood, i saw it out infront of my house earlier today, sometimes it's in my backyard, i see it in my neighbors yard a lot, i think it's because they keep cat food on their porch, they've got three cats. i'm allergic to cats. i'm allergic to rabbits too, that's why i love connie so much. she's my baby!!!  (no one's allowed to eat her!) "and you can sing this song when i'm gone" i don't know why i'm addicted to writting in my diary thing today, it just seems like... i dunno, i think i'm going insane. woohoo! i don't know if i'm going to go online tonight, it seems to be my poison lately. i just stay on all night and have mindless, but not meaningless conversations with anyone and everyone. it's hardest for me to talk to the ones i love the most, or it was lst night. i was in a bit of a volatile mood. i don't know if it showed. anyway, i'm off to write some crappy poetry and about killing spiders and being emo in the corner and crying about them. actually no, no emo today. "we had joy, we had fun, we had season in the sun, but the stars that we could reach were just star fish on the beach"

      yes.... just as i said, i am writting more down here in my (own private idaho) own little sancuary. hehehe. i've actaully got no energy, it's hellishly cold out here and the heater is broken, all i can think to do is curl up under the blankets and invited people over so i can snuggle with them for their body heat. it's  that  cold in here. but... since i live under a dictatorship, no one will come here and i will shiver alone. oh well. there are many other nights to find people to sleep with. that makes me sound strange... oh well, i am strange. :) right now i'm listening to hippie music, it makes me happy. while i was upstairs a few minutes ago i burnt myself a cd with some of my favorite songs. currently i'm listening to jefferson airplane. bello bello. i feel a bit like dancing, or maybe my body just wants to move around to make heat. either way... i'm going. love and kisses.

      shite. I don't know how this happened but I'm hooked on techno music again. I should have known this was coming since I've been having HUGE cravings to go to raves lately, but who knew it would progress this far this fast? egh, it was probably a lot due to my two and a half hour stint on ddr yesterday. see, white girls can dance too! okay, maybe not, but who dance like that anyway? maybe those little asian guys who move their feet HELLA (egh, I hate that word) fast, but still, not  real   dancing. bah, whatever. I had really thought I had solved this techno obsession last year, well, the beginning of freshman year I guess. I really really thought I'd cured my infatuation. meh, this isn't good. I really want to go to a rave soon. I'm gathering people. we're going to crash a rave real soon, i still have my glow stick behind my bed, this will be won-der-ful. okay, that's all.

      "something smells wierd in here" I look the other way and point to the container on my desk. I realize the inquisitor can not see what I'm referring to as they are lying upon my bed (MY BED!) I pick it up and tipping over very carefully reveal to them the contents. dirt, dirt, and more dirt. The plant inside was just starting to come back to life, it's a weed, but that will work, it always grows (i'm growing). The inquisitor accepts this as the source of the smell, I don't say anything more on the subject. I'm feeling pretty lucky today. If I believed in god, which I don't, I'd pray to him right now, and thank him for the luck I was blessed with today. "Blessed children of the pond, please pcik up your minds and follow that trail back into the woods of your home, the woods were you came to learn the meaning of life." Around 8:30, a few minutes after Geary left i remembered I had to mail a letter, so I left my house to walk the two blocks to the mail box, past the bus stop where Geary was sitting. I sat there until the bus came and took him away, went to the mailbox and walked back home. The whole venture took me maybe (MAYBE) 7 minutes. As soon as I turned the corner to walk down my street I see a gleaming white van, uhoh. My mom was home, and early too. My mind went crazy, i couldn't remember the condition I left my room, I couldn't remember anything. I walked in real casual, like i didn't see any danger. And there wasn't any, I thanked my lucky stars, the ones I never knew I had. I couldn't believe my luck. What a difference 5 little minutes can make, life or death. I went to goat hill pizza to get my dinner, I love that place so much. so so so very much. I'm saving the left over pizza for lunch tomorrow. and now is when i stop writting and start my homework. good night minions.

      Bello, it's 8:22 and I haven't done ANY of my homework from spring break. okay, I didn't really have that much homework. I just have to do some French worksheets, study for my French test, and gather some things for my biology project. The best part is is that it's now dark out and possibly raining *crosses fingers, please rain tomorrow, please rain*  this means I'm going to have to explore my backyard in the dark, bello right? right. But in other news, I've finished my painting, this makes me happy, i never finish ANYTHING, seriously, I can do a lot of things, but it's really hard for me to finish something. If you ever investigate my room there are dozens of half finished projects that are just gathering dust. I partially blame my laziness and partially blame my fear of ending things. I don't fear dying, i just fear endings, does that make sense? I don't really care if it does, because I know what I mean. Anyway, this is the final product of my painting, I'm aware it's pretty shitty, but a lot of emotion went into it. "better than a knife right?"

      I promised I would go to sleep... I really don't think thats possible, so I'll go paint for a little while then climb back into bed and do some use some hardcore sleep tactics. if you have ANY ideas of sleeping, or how to make an insomniac sleep please leave me a message, i'm desperate, i got back to school tomorrow and i want to go in with sleep. I haven't slept almost all week except maybe an hour or two everyother night. I'm not lying here, I'm dead fucking serious. SOMEONE FUCKING GIVE ME SEDATIVES!!!!!

      Well, it really does feel like spring break is over, for the first time since wendesday night I'm sleeping in my own room and in my own bed. sigh, a new era approaches so quickly. I don't know how my insomnia will go tonight, i was so fucking tired today, it took so much strength just to keep my head up, and I  partially fell asleep/passed out on the bus while going to Julia's, I missed the stop and had to walk about 5 blocks which was really nice because it was misting (okay, not really sure about this word, but i don't like saying light drizzle, it sounds too dignified) Julia and I went to see a crappy movie which doesn't have a title, nor do i remember the characters names. We just lied around infront of the theatre, it was nice, except my head felt like it was dying, or about to split open, or just sleep deprived. meh. I failed in getting the Belle and Sebastian tickets, this saddens me a bit, I'll have to go after school one day when there is a show at the fillmore. Yet another excuse not to come home after school. I still haven't figured out how i manage to get home from school at 7:00 everyday, it just doesn't make sence, I don't really have anything after school... sigh, oh well. No one is online, this saddens me a bit, I have no one to share my insomnia with, I guess everyone else has school tomorrow, I don't, this makes me happy. Knowing that I'll have the house to myself again tomorrow also makes me happy, very very happy. yes. . . . . anyway. I've been listening to bodies by smashing pumpkins on repeat for the last hour, i think i'm depressed.  In other news I've been painting a lot lately. I've been doing a lot of abstract, i've never been a huge fan of abstract painting, I've got nothing against it, it just never interested me, now it's all i can do. I tried sketching for a while, i just got pissed off and went back to my paints. I spent way too much money on paints last month, almost all my money :( sigh, at least they will last me for awhile, like a year for most colours. I hate art stores, well, it's one of those love/hate relationships. I hate that i love them so much because whenever I go in an art store, flax in particular, i find things that i need and want and need and want, and before I realize it I've spent all my money in theart store. I guess art supplies are better than me wasting my money on something else... like clothes. But anyway, back to talking about abstract. I really think there is some kind or corrolation between me having a sudden interest in abstract and my emotional state (insanity if you didn't know).  It's not exactly an identity crisis, but I'm going threw something and I've got no idea what it is, my thoughts aren't my own and well, i don't really feel like writting about it here. But i definately think that my mental state is effecting my art. Art is a good release, better than... well, previous methods i've used for my depression and anger. much much better. okay, that's enough of my ramblings for this hour. I think i'm going to go call geary and wake him up.  hah, goodnight.

      Well, once again it's about 4 in the morning and I'm still awake, this is bad. Today (meaning yesterday) was kinda crappy, i actually dont feel like talking about it. The animatrix just ended, now i'm watching cowboy bebop, the second one i've seen. It's good but a little strange, maybe it's just that my mental state is strange, or both, who knows. I have to go to sunday school in about 5 hours, I'm not really looking foward to that. I skipped last week, i don't remember why, but I did. I probably just wanted to sleep in or something like that. I think I'm rambling, yeah, I am. I need to pee and I'm a bit hungery too. okay, bye.

      Foward: I was cleaning up some papers that were stacked high on one of my shelfs, I found this poem. I didn't write it, neither did the person who showed it to me, no one knows who wrote it, but everyone has heard it, or should hear it. Kristin showed me this poem last year, I found a copy of it typed neatly in a stack of papers about the 30 years war, I guess that's what i was studying at the time. It's always... interesting (?) to find things from past lifes, well, from existances that have died. and without further ado, the poem...   Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines         he wrote a poem And he called it "Chops"         because that was the name of his dog And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A         and a gold star And his mother hung it on the kitchen door         and read it to his aunts That was the year Father Tracy         took all the kids to the zoo And he let them sing on the bus And his little sister was born         with tiny toenails and no hair And his mother and father kissed a lot And the girl around the corner sent him a          Valentine signed with a row of X's         and he had to ask his father what the X's meant And his father always tucked him in bed at night And was always there to do it  On a piece of white paper with blue lines         he wrote a poem And he called it "Autumn"         because that was the name of the season And that's what it was all about And his teacher gave him an A         and asked him to write more clearly And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door         because of its new paint And the kids told him         that Father Tracy smoked cigars And left butts on the pews And sometimes they would burn holes That was the year his sister got glasses         with think lenses and black frames And the girl around the corner laughed         when he asked her to go see Santa Claus And the kids told him why         his mother and father kissed a lot And his father never tucked him in bed at night And his father got mad         when he cried for him to do it.  Once on a paper torn from his notebook         he wrote a poem And he called it "Innocence: A Question"         because that was the question about his girl And that's what it was all about And his professor gave him an A         and a strange steady look And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door         because he never showed her That was the year that Father Tracy died And he forgot how the end         of the Apostle's Creed went And he caught his sister         making out on the back porch And his mother and father never kissed         or even talked And the girl around the corner         wore too much makeup That made him caugh when he kissed her         but he kissed her anyway         because that was the thing to do And at three A.M. he tucked himself into bed         his father snoring soundly  That's why on the back of a brown paper bag         he tried another poem And he called it "Absolutely Nothing" Because that's what it was really all about And he gave himself an A         and a slash on each damned wrist And he hung it on the bathroom door         because this time he didn't think         he could reach the kitchen.

      Okay, I can keep my eyes open now. Today is wonderful wonderful wonderful. I woke up smiling, i don't think i've done that in a very long time. It was like the first day of summer. I woke up around 10:30 because babsy called me from work to see if I was awake yet and to inform me that I still needed to the recycling (I still need to do that...) And then she told me to eat breakfast, as she always does, but that I might want to eat it on the dinning room table, I sat up in bed very fast. for the past week my mom has been hinting around that my uncle is going to send me his old SRL camera, because I don't technically have my own. I knew that I was going to get it, but i didn't know when. I Hung up with her and ran into the dinning room to find a box with my name on it. In the box is a beautiful Olympus OM-2n SLR camera, from the early 80's. It's beautiful. My uncle also sent me two extra lens, now I've got a wide angle and a marco lens, I'm in love with the marco lens (I've been secretly saving my lunch money to buy myself one ofthose for the past few months) He also sent a mini tripod, it's adorable, some filters, and a release cord. I couldn't have been happier, but then it got better.  The mail came around 11 or so, I was too excited about my camera to go look at what came, besides, i never realy get mail unless I'm expecting something, which I wasn't. SO I happened to walk by where the mail was lying... A large envelope... it has my name on it.... it's from CSSSA. I squeeled and tour it open   Congratulations! The Screening panel has completed its evaluation of your candidacy. You are invited to become a member of the 2004 class of the California State Summer School for the Arts-InnerSpark.   joy dances around the room. I was almost certain that I wasn't going to get in, and then i did.  Now i've got to make a decission. I can either go to photo journalism and backpacking for a month in washington, or go to L.A. for art school. I'd rather do the art school. But it's not quite that easy, The thing in washington is part of a scholarship program, they send me on two completely free summer trips, pay for all my college apps, give me SAT prep classes, and lots of other benefits. And you can only enter the program in soph. year.... so I don't know what to do. I'll probably end up going to washington, maybe  art school next year. I HATE THIS!!!  Belle and Sebastian was beautiful last night. We bought scalped tickets for 50 each, they were originally 30... but it was worth it. We had seats on the floor, which meant we stood maybe 10-20 feet away from belle and sebastian. They played a lot of songs off of "Dear Catastrophe waitress", almost all the songs off of it actually... they Also played "sleep the clock around" and "get me away from here i'm dying" and "seeing other people" and "beautiful" oh the whole night was just beautiful, especially since i didn't expect any of it to happen.

      "you know it will make it that much better" I'm kinda pissed off right now, no, pissed off isn't the correct word, I don't really know what the correct word would be, I'm not very good about verbalizing my emotions. All the premonitions, and well, haunting dreams are coming more and more true. I really am losing everyone, everything I once held dear, it's flung itself out of control, i'm out of control "a real friend would hand me the gun" so why do i feel so alone right now, so fucking hurt, stepped on and squashed. I'm being petty, I know, maybe it's just the isolation of this house for the past 5 days, but then again, I know it's not. I really am losing everyone, everyone that mattered, that still maters. I'm crying right now, the kind of crying where you get a headache and want to shoot yourself.  "from the shelter of my mind to the window of my eye" I don't know why I do it anymore, why i even try, I don't belong here, i don't belong with anything i have, i really really need to get out of here, out of this place. The few things i've been staying around for, the things that keep the blade from my skin, well they're gone now, evaporated into eachothers lives. That trip i've been talking about, well, i think it's day is getting closer, yeah, i'll wait until it can be legal, but that day is getting closer too. i have nothing worth staying around here for. it's out of my control, out of my reach, just hand me the fucking knife and i'll end it all now. So now I can barely see the screen through my blurred tears, oh well, oh well, it's not like anyone cares, i want to say goodbye but i can't bare to, i don't want to, i really don't want to. but the door hit me on the way in, i said i never meant to leave, but now all i can see is the door. "so i'll play the game" i guess it's what i made happen, because i can never talk, and i porbably never will, well you can see, i'm dying here, and this time i'm not lying. i've died inside, but no one can see, no one saw me when i was alive, so it doesn't really matter, nothing really matters, we all die in the end anyway, why is now any different than further down this fucking road. I WANT OUT, but there is no plane to come and save me, nothing to save me. I lost what really mattered to me, i lost it in a blink of an eye, duch good shading i didn't see the transition. now i'm dreaming of before, what went wrong, why i'm here all alone. isolation is my one known, it's all i've ever known, i don't know why i thought it would change, i never change.  now i'll just dissapear, and it wont matter, because it seems to be over.

      mh, I've ben sick for the past few days, it's been... well, sickly. I've had a starnge stomache bug and haven't been able to eat in a few days. I just spent the last hour staring at an avacado wishing I could eat it. Then I've been having low blood pressure i think, i'm not really sure but i can't really stand up without falling down or grabbing onto something to stabalize myself, I've pretty much just been stuck lying in bed reading. I guess taht isn't so bad except i sun burned my back to the point of swelling, fun stuff huh? well yes... thats about all.

      today was good, i woke up to sleep the clock around, and want back to sleep. I woke up again around 11 and remembered i was going to give lisa a wake up call at 8, oops. but sleep was good. I slept the most last night and it was the best sleep i've had in over a month (well, from whenever i developed insomnia, i kinda forget the beginning date) so i gave lisa a call, and around 1 her mom came and picked me up. I spent the rest of the day at her house. tonight is prom night, right now lisa, julia and sean are all at prom.  Julia, Sean, and George all came to Lisa's house around 6 something to finish  getting ready. I got to put Julia's make up on. Then George gave me a ride home and let me borrow his donnie darko dvd.   I just finished watching it a little while ago, it's still sinking in. I had never seen the movie but many people were telling me i had to. it was... i can't think of the appropriate word. it was made by the same person who made final destiantion, i liked that movie as well. donnie darko was depressing, but even more so because i could make certain parallels with my own life. it was good, i enjoyed it and am probably going to watch it again tonight or tomorrow morning, it all depends.  I might go out in a few hours, the prom ends at 1:00 so Lisa, Julia, and Sean may come get me since the prom isn't too far away from my house. they were talking about going bowling or maybe seeing donnie darko. who knows, i'm not even really sure if i can go out. but i can find a way, there is always a way.   I still haven't gotten a new internet cord for my computer, i really hate not being able to use that computer because it's gota ton of images that i'd like to post here. oh well, maybe i'll go buy one this weekend, but until then good night.

      "you'll learn little child, you'll learn" it was that kind of day. I don't know what that means, but my feet really hurt. School was a drag today, I was harassed by my biology teacher for not coming yesterday to watch the video, but she loves me so it wasn't all that bad, but i  really  have to go watch it on monday. I had a good conversation with my english teacher about 1984, which is one of my favorite books. Apparently there's a movie of it, he's going to bring it in and let me borrow it. I'm nota huge fan of movies of books, expecially when I see the movie first. I don't like to be influenced by someone else's interpretation of a book while i'm forming my own thoughts.         yes....      My geometry teacher is still sick, I feel really bad for him, he comes to school most of the days and just tells us we can have a study period because he feels to sick to teach. I've heard him coughing, I think he has pnemonia or something of the sort, his cough gave me the shivers. I really hope he feels better. Oh, french was alright today as well, we got to play expression bingo, it was the first time all year that we've played a game. I have to admit I actually had a good time in french.  After school Lisa, Casey and I went to get food because I was starving, then to lisa's house with a HUGE detour through glen park. I made them go through SOTA as well because that's the school I should have gone to, the school i got into (visual arts) and the school I wasn't allowed to go to. "you need to get a real education" oh well, i wont get into that subject. It was fun being back in those hallways again, I had really missed it. We also went through glen park, I saw my old pre-school "nursery school is over and we are going home, good bye, good bye, except for...." oh i loved being a little kid.  well there's three of us and one tostado (sp?) what did you expect?  Lisa and I went to the school chorus concert, it was bello. I really wish I could sing when I hear all there amazing voices, sigh (emo tear, the purest tear of them all) mr. murphy was there, i wanted to harass him but i had to leave.   that's about all. tomorrow is friday, i haven't really figured out what i'm doing exactly, I know i need to get to SI at one point to see julia. but i need to figure that out. la la la la, i feel a lot like dancing right now, but my feet hurt so much, all the walking these past days *shakes fist* oh well. so i'm deciding to to end this entry by singing rocky racoon.    now rocky racoon checked into his room only to find....

       Sebastian you're in a mess You had a dream, they called you king Of all the hipsters, is it true? Or are you still the queen?   School was alright today, I had my least volatile classes. Bio was.. I can't remember, I think we did sheets or took notes, or something boring. Then I had a Geometry test, it was really easy, it always is, i finished 45 minutes early, my teacher glared at me while he was reading my test. I think I bother him, I never pay attention in class (sleeping mostly), I do my homework maybe half the time, and then i get the highest score on all the tests. I think it's resentment. Also, when i used to stay awake I was always correcting him, teachers sdon't like that very much. Lunch was beautiful, i was supposed to go to bio and watch some video but it was sunny and all my dearest friends were sitting in a circle in the sun. I skipped the bio thing and stayed with them to eat lunch. It was special. Then english, I hada sub, i drew on casey most of the time while attepmting to start different homework assignments. And then the clock struck 1:15 and i was free for the day.   Lisa took me to get dessert because i burned her 20 copies of a cd. then we went to haight to get lisa a wrap, we were going to meet sean there but he was having a newspaper crisis and couldn't come. Lisa didn't find a wrap but i got a really nice sweater (it's actually a jacket, but my goal for the day was to get a sweater... so i'm pretending it's a sweater). it has stripes.  I forgot the purpose of writting here. I had something I wanted to say, but now my memory if out the door  hand over the window  I've been listening to belle and sebastian all day.  Oh! i remember. I took the bus to school this morning, I haven't had to do that in a while. it was really nice. The 19 goes right by the farmers market at the UN plaza ( i think that's what it's called) but i stared hungrily out the window, i had not eaten breakfast and there were mounds of fruit. If i hadn't been pushing being late i would have stopped. I was even considering coming to school late with flowers in my arms and a bag of fruit ( a summer dream) because i would only be missing bio. but i decided to be punctual (pats self on the back), i wish i hadn't, i need to start living more. But it's almost summer, i'll get a lot of good adventures in then, oh i can't wait.  thats all, i can't feel my feet but i have the urge to get up and dance.

       if you could hear the way this sounds, you just might be swayed  Today was alright, no more, no less. I had a nice afternoon on the grassy hil between california and washington streets. it was an afternoon well spent.  The dinner i had to go to was dismal, i had a headache and they had no food that didn't have meat in it. I ended up eating a cookie because i felt really hungery, on the verge of passing out actually.   "our chance is gone"  I'm not really in the mood to write anything right now. well i am, just not this. i know... I'll post some of my story up here. the first page or so. how's that sound? okay? ALRIGHT!!!!     Chapter One  And it's a shame they all said to her A living shame It's not like it was her fault or anything It was just a shame, that's all. They constantly reminded her of this, the shame and whatnot. She let them, it wasn't really her place to say anything or do anything. It seemed that they liked to sulk around in her problems more than she did. Sure, it was an unfortunate thing to happen, but she wasn't about to bask around in all the sorrow, all the heartbreak, and all the leeway for depression they gave her. As much as she didn't like to think it, sometimes she thought that she should feel worse about the situation, she should be morose, and sit and cry. Let them make her feel better. Was it wicked not to care? But then again, that wasn't it. She did care; this was just her way of dealing with it. She wasn't trying to pretend that it didn't happen, she knew what happened, she accepted what happened, she grieved but she wasn't going to let the depression take over her life. It just wasn't how it was meant to be.  If we all went into deep depressions every time something went wrong in out lives then no one anywhere would ever be happy. Death was everywhere, there were many evils of the world, but some of them just had to be accepted. Accepted and dealt with. Sure, sometimes depression was okay, but she didn't like the way that they were all pressuring her to feel depressed. Sure she missed them, she really did, and she knew what happened was bad. But she wasn't going to let it take over her life. She wasn't. She kept telling herself that for a few weeks. That was, until she realized that that was all she was ever thinking about. It wasn't going to take over her life. So she stopped thinking. Not completely. One can never stop thinking completely. She just stopped thinking about most things. She would let what happen happen. And with that mentality she failed three of her classes and barely passed the others. Everything was just irrelevant. She came to school when she felt like it. And went to c lass wherever she chose. It was her life right, right?  No, it wasn't. Soon enough her stack of counselor request slips fell over on her. She didn't go willingly of course, but she went none the less. The minute she entered the office she knew she shouldn't have come to school that day. She just knew it. It was a mistake. Perhaps I should back up a bit. Tell the tale for the beginning. Just why she felt pressured to be depressed and why everyone thought it was a shame. A month prior to her counselor visit her two best friends, well, apparent best friends were killed in a tragic car crash. It's wasn't exactly a crash. Her friends had been standing on the street corner and a car went out of control and hit and killed them at the site.  The thing was, although she had spent a lot of time with her two friends, they weren't really her friends. They were there when they felt like it. They didn't really make her feel accepted, but being friends with them was better than sitting home alone on a Saturday night. But, to the general public, meaning her school community the three of them had been best of friends, real buddies.  But her school community saw little and heard even less. She was very aware of this but tried to stand out all the same.  Her parents showered her in pity, and, for the most part, left her alone. She had siblings, two brothers, but they were older and she heard from them infrequently. They didn't come home very often. She was however, more or less content with her home life, if it could be called that. Her parents, in leaving her alone, let her be out as long as she liked, and gave her a nice allowance. She let them think whatever they wanted. She didn't like being home much, and therefore, hardly ever was.

      Type type type, it's almost becoming automatic. I spent a good deal of the evening working on my story. Did i ever mention that? i'm writting a story, a book, a manuscript, a whatever. It's fiction obviously, but parts of it are taken from my life and from those around me. Okay, not exactly taken, but heavely influenced. I started writting the story in december while I was sitting in the SFO ariport waiting for my plane to take me to doomsville (new jersey, eternal damnination) the plane was 2 hours late. I sat away from my famliy against some pillar that had a power outlet on it.   The story has changed a lot, it's definately progressed with me as I've changed.  change change change  In my mind it's already over, that will hurt to say, i know it will. I don't want to say that, or anything truthfully because I don't like dissapointing people. I'll go on letting them believe what they want to for now, even thought that's not who I am. I need to get out of my situation. Right now i'd like to take along drive down the coast, either alone or with a dear friend of mine.   I feel a bit like throwing up, I disgust myself with my thoughts. I can't believe some of the shit i've done, i don't regret it because i'm not the regretting type, i just don't want to go through that again. do that again. I wonder if anyone understands that, i doubt the one person who does need to understand that will, or if they do, they will be angered and know that my mind has made a decission.   I've been flirting with certain concepts for a few years, longer than i can puntucally remember. concepts about myself, about who i am. i always figured thats how everyone was, everyone thought about that once in a while, at some point in their life. but i'm not anyone, i mena, i'm not just anyone, i'm different, and proud of that too. i've come to realize in the past few months that i am that way, that i am, i am, oh i am. but fitting into the mold makes so many less waves. i don't want to crush others dreams. like i said, i'm going to dissapoint so many people, but i'm dissapointing myself right now.   tomorrow i go to my psycologist again, maybe i'll tell him about that, i porbably wont. i need to work this out on my own. no, i've already worked it out. "i always cry at endings" there is an ending coming up, but it will also be a beginning, so it will be new.  different differenciate  I should probably be doing my pre-cal homework, my final is in a week, i'm starting to get a wee bit nervous about that. I have an A in the class and i understand everything, but finals always make me nervouse. plus, if i've got all this emotional crap going on it will be so much harder to conecentrate on school work. mleh.  sometimes i wonder if anyone reads this, this, my journal, my life.  no wait i wonder if anyone understands this. understands my writting, or in other words, my life. do you understand?  do you care?     is there anyone out there because it's getting harder and harder to breath.

      I realized something today, I'd rather hurt myself and hurt others. I need to make a decision, no, I've already made it. Now it's just a matter of courge, i hate hurting others, which is exactly why it's taken me awhile to really address this problem. they don't even know there is a problem, that's the problem. Some issues I used to have with myself,  well, not really issues, things i thought about. Well, I had kind of thought I had settled them, in my mind at least, but I don't think I have. Or actually I have settled them, I'm just acting against my mind again, I'm acting, see the problem? That's not really me you see in the halls everyday, it's not the real me, just a shadow of a dream i once had to belong.   So about that realization, I'm going to need to say something soon, or I could just dissapear and run away from the problem, that's what I've been doing this past week, but on a smaller scale. I really wish things didn't turn out as they did, but shit, i really hate hurting other people, I probably wont say anything for a long time, just because i like to avoid confrontation.   In other news, I came home right after school today, that was a first, I got home around 3:00, i was amazed. I made myself some lunch because I hadn't eaten all day, then i took a nap. Right now I'm supposed to be in my student council meeting, it started at 5:15, it wont end until 7:30. I rally really should be there, but I have a killer headache and don't feel like getting back on the bus.   yawn  I still haven't figured out what i'm doing this summer. I'll be 18 in one year and 4 months and 14 days. Babsy would let me graduate early, I'd like to go to college a year early, I can't stand SH, the walls, the expectations, the prejudices, just everything. I wish I didn't hate it so much because I really love learning, so now I just ask why? I need to get out of there, I can't wait until the summer.

      The best way of waking up is to the sand that fills your bed, then remembering how it got there, who was there the night before. I love waking up to sand.   "i'm waking up to us"   So yesterday, friday may 14, I woke up in a horrible state, I hadn't slept at all, so it wasn't really waking, it was much more realizing that I had to get out of bed and go to school without any sleep, once again. So I arrived at school as I always did, I took my Pre-Calc final at 7:55 in the morning, I wasn't as nervous as I should have been. The test was actually pretty easy, I got really confused on one problem early on in the test, but everything else went well, so I guess the incessive studying last night really paid off. Then, let's see, broadcast time, there was a shortage of annoucements so casey and I shared one, I was in a quirky mood so "Ya'll know who y'are" I did my best southern accent. I've always been known to do stange things with the annoucements, it's a risk letting me do thme live, and they've stopped playing our pre-recorded ones. The day got progressively grueling, I blame lask of sleep. I was very glad my french teacher was out because I didn't thnk I would have been able to handle a full hour and 15 minutes of french. Lunch was passe, and in biology the teacher put on a movie about darwin so I took a  very  nice hour long nap. Of course I was woken up by Dany and Sean throwing teddy grams at me, but that's become ruetine.   After school I really didn't have any plans, I had briefly spoken to Julia the night before about possibly coming to visit, but I was kicked off line before anything was decided. so after school Casey and I took a nice walk to the Van Ness Station with chemicals to releave the crappy friday.  Caasey was headed to the mall to meet some friend of hers from her old school, so I decided to go to S.I. Halfway there I realized that Julia was probably wasn't going to be at school still since school had let out an hour prior so I gave Sean a call. He said she was at some resturant, so I went there and found her. But that wasn't what caugt my eye first. about a year ago, Kristin, Kevie and I had a small obbession with this guy named Mick at S.I. he worked the carousel and we'd go and visit him on saturdays. I haven't really talked to him since then, he was kind of an asshole. But he was in teh resturant as well, and it caught me off gaurd.  Julia and I went to the beach, explaining the sand in my bed. Then I took her to her doctors appointment and sat in the waiting room eating lucky charms while some old lady glared at me. Then we contacted george and he came to pick us up. We tried to barter for a pink shirt, and almost boughta huge knife, but ended up getting coke and shrimp instead. We decided to go to a hill, so we drove up to twin peaks and climbed to different hills "they say it's going to get really windy up here later tonight" another hill clmber jokinly commented becasue it was already ridiculously windy. Then we picked up Casey and got more food and went up to Mt. Davidson, the one with the HUGE white cross on it. I did my catholic duties by smoking on the foot of the cross and singing "the hills are alive with the sound of music". Casey and I sat on some form of a bench and watched the city lights for a really long time, when I have my license in a few weeks I'm going to go back there with my camera and tripod and take a huge panaramic picture, not to mention do other things up there. We dropped Casey back off at her house around 9:00 and then Julia and George came over and stayed until 11:00. We were going to watch fatal attraction, but the assholes at blockbuster we're being assholes. instead we layed on my bed and watched the Belle and Sebastian DVD. All in all it was a very god night.  There was more that happened later on the internet, but I don't feel like documenting it here, it's too... just no.

      is an introduction really nessisary? no, i think not. but i'd like to take this time to thank lisa for giving my this information, it's INVALUABLE!!!   sputnik 94109 (10:18:42 PM): I appreciate her enthusiasm, but be sure to slap her around a tad for having such a shamelessly emo screen name. sputnik 94109 (10:19:11 PM): and if I find out she writes bad poetry to go along with that screenname, I suggest she move as far away from me as the earth's geography will allow. sputnik 94109 (10:20:08 PM): no, I'm sorry, I must have meant deep revealing an insighful. sputnik 94109 (10:20:19 PM): and I'm sure she's a fine poet. sputnik 94109 (10:20:32 PM): right up there with that pompous bastard from dashboard confessional.

      I really really shouldn't be on my computer right now, let alone writting on this little journal thing. Tomorrow at 7:55 in the AM I take my pre-calc final. I'm almost done studying... I've only  got one and a half chapters left to review, wich is pretty good considering it's only 8:13 and I would normally just be starting my homework about now... or in a few hours. I still have to do my actual homework for all those other passe classes I take, but that's not at my list of priorities right now, I need to get a good grade on the final to get and A in the class. last semester i had an 87 this semester I have a 95  and the final is 20% of my grade, which means i should be studying...like... right now. *shrugs* i'll call this my study break.  Coming home on the bus was interesting today. I never really come home right after school so it was a little strange riding the bus around by myself at 2:30 in the afternoon. It was a very pensive ride. I've been very pensive in general lately, casue and effect senarios, and a tad bit of history. I'm not really sure if that's making sense, so I'll clarify a little bit while still remaining annoyingly ellusive and uncomprehensible. I was really depressed at a certain time, I was also having problems in school, i was hearing certain rumors. I acted on a whim to quiet the rumors and to fill the viod of depression. thus leading to the "one really stupid thing a year" (it's a theory of mine, i'll explain later perhaps). Well, it cured the rumors, i was... normal by others standards, plainly put, no longer given the sideways glances and uncomforting questions, but i knew it was all a lie, which depressed me more. so I woke up one morning and said "what the hell am I doing?" I don't know if that really clarifies and more. I was just figuring things out on the bus, it explained a lot about my life in the past three or four years. Almost like fate now that I think of it.... strange.  Anyway, the bus, I was looking out the wondos at one point or another, I was somewhere near the civic center, and there was a man dressed in bright yellow (at first i wished casey was around so i could punch her, because all things yellow get punches, along with "special" cars. the punch buggy game...expanded) but then i noticed he was leaning face against a fence, two cops beating the hell out of him with their black pole things, batons? police cruelty, the man was already in handcuffs, he  wasn't trying to run away, i just don't understand some things in this world. I'm not trying to defend the guy, i'm sure he did something to desserve the arrest, but violence? do we really need more violence? I asked myself that as two teachers guided a class of small children across the street to avoid the sceen. I then went to stike up a nice conversation with the person sitting next to me about violence in our society. I love meeting new people on busses, they've always got interesting views, well, not always, but it's worth the gamble.  I am still multicoloured, casey made a big deal about it today, she dragged me over to all sorts of people and said "look at my art" then proceeded to lift my shirt up. i felt like a flasher all day long. it was comical in it's own way. Lisa, Frankie, and I tried to get Casey back after school, all that happened was us getting yelled at by Mr. Moy because we were causing havoc in the hallway and myself gaining new bite marks and unnessisary loss of skin due to sharp fingernails. WE WILL GET YOU BACK!!!!   Mr. Murphy loved his pie, he ate it with us at lunch, it actually turned out really good, although it it was cold it would have been a whole lot better. Today was the last day that I'm going to be able to sit at my pole in the courtyard and eat lunch with lisa (emo tear) today was the last day of senoir classes. Mr. Murphy suggested we tag our names on the pole just to claim it, I'm thinking of licking it since that's my claiming method. perhaps tomorrow it will really become MINE MINE MINE.  alright, i've procrastinated my studying enough and I just realized that I've had Holland 1945 on repeat for the past half hour. I put commenting back on here, i accidentaly deleated it a week or so ago, but now it's back. whoopie!

      Hm, I had wanted to post some pictures of what happened today, but most of them were too.... we'll leave it at that. Casey and Lisa came over, apparently to make pies, but it's never just for pies. We did however make two lemon merange pies. one for Mr. Murphy, and one for one of Lisa's classes. We also made cookies, they were gone in about an hour because Max and Mateo were present for a little while. As always things progressed as they do and I ended up lying on my bed with my arms and legs duck taped together, They couldn't seem to keep duck tape over my mouth because I would start eating it and spitting it at them. I'm also now technicoloured, lov-oh-lee.  I should stop keeping so many sharpies in my room. All in all it was a very good day, even if I can no longer wear short sleave shirts in my house for a week or so. Seeing how i never shower, all this body paint will be on for another weeks or so. I haven't showered in about... a little over two weeks. Lisa points at me and says, "dirty liberal" or just calls me an indie kid. I don't have many good comebacks, i never do.  I have an english test whish I have to study for tomorrow. It's not really a big deal kind of test, but I have to be super careful with my grade in english because of all that whooplah that happened last quarter with my catcher in the rye essay. mleh, I'm still pretty pissed off about that. anyway...... I've also got to start studying for my pre-cal final because it's THIS friday,  i'm in the only class that has to take it this week, everyone else takes it monday or wednesday, i'm really mad.  My legs are starting to get really cramped from sitting like this on my bed, I need to get that new internet cord so i can use my other computer again. gr...   Tuesdays are death days, it's my new lingo for excomunication. or something of that sort. It's the day i skip out on an afternoon of school and think about all the things i should say but wont. Sometimes i really do wonder what would happen if i was completely honest with everything and everyone. sigh, some things i'll never know. Oh! but on the very very bright side, I'm in a wonderfully good mood today, actually i've been in pretty good moods all week, wonder why?   anyway, i'm thinking it's homework time, so goodnight my loves.

       "let's just take the train"   When I got home today I gave the lady at Summer Search a call, I was supposed to call at lunch but forgot. She's the one controlling what I do this summer, and I had asked last week if I could go to CSSSA in L.A. instead of backpacking in Washington. I asked on friday and she told me to call back today, so I called. And know what...? I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL, I'M GOING TO ART SCHOOL. I really didn't think she'd let me go because there is a huge emphasis on going to an outdoor camp. But she said that the program would make an exception for moe. WOOHOO!!!! Now i've just got to fill out a dozen or so forms and send them down there by next friday.   That's really all i've got to say right now. I ran into my old friend today on the bus, we haven't spoken in... 3 years? we used to be best friends but then had a huge fight in 6th grade. I don't even remember what it was about, sigh, i don't really care either. It was strange seeing her though.

      As it were, I’m dallying. Actually, I was dallying, now I’m actually waiting for the bus, my appointment is in 15 minutes, it’s about a 7 minute bus ride so now all I really need is for the bus to come and carry me away. I got out of school at 12:30 and stopped at Cala to buy myself some lunch, I hadn’t eaten during my actual lunch period so I was very hungry. I got some bread and cheese and the famed chocolate milk, I’ve been really getting obsessed with chocolate milk lately, I hate the taste of normal milk, but when it’s disguised with chocolate it isn’t all that bad. Anyway, after I bought my lunch I walked the rest of the way to Sacramento Street where there is a park and my bus stop. I sat in the park for a while and ate my lunch. Now I’m sitting on a ledge by the bus stop waiting for the bus. I’ve now got 10 minutes to get there, I have a feeling I’m going to be late again, I shouldn’t have given myself a picnic. Bleh.  WHERE IS THE BUS?????  I’m starting to get impatient, so I’ll tell a story.   Why I love that my name begins with and A By Allie One Tuesday morning I was lying in bed, sleeping in fact. It was pretty early and my bright eyes playing stereo alarm clock had not yet gone off to Conner Oberst voice. This was the way I was accustomed to waking up on school days  “there’s a man holding a megaphone musta been the voice of god”.  I was very peacefully asleep until I heard what I thought was my cell phone, a second listen, yes yes it is. I sat up in bed and say the blue light that my phone emits when ringing. I check quickly to see who’s calling because I’m one of those people who screen their calls, it was Lisa, so I picked it up. No, it wasn’t Lisa, it was her backpack. I swore and hung the phone up, it flashed the time, 6:15. And for a few moments there I couldn’t figure out what I was doing, I didn’t remember what day of the week it was, or if I had to go to school. Then I remembered it was Tuesday, a school day, and I had 15 more minutes left of which I could sleep So let me explain the A part, you see, when people forget to lock the keys on their cell phones, and they get banged around in their backpack, there is a very good chance that the phone book will open and call one of the first few people on the list. And A is always at the top. I get lots of calls from backpacks, it’s even better when I don’t pick up and I get 20 minutes messages from backpacks.   Ahah, the bus has arrived, I am supposed to be there in 2 minutes, I guess I’ll just be late again. Sigh, maybe I’ll make my mom write the note for 12:20 next time.

      Sorry to keep putting lyrics up here, but it's been that kind of week, i've got songs floating all about my mind. So here are the lyrics to "is it wicked not to care" by none other than belle and sebastian. It's on of the very few belle and sebastian songs i can play on my guitar. and i've been singing it in my head for the better part of the past week.   Is it wicked not to care when they say that you're mistaken  Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there?  Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours  Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?  I know the truth awaits me But still I hesitate because of fear  Skipping tickets making rhymes Is that all that you believe in? Wearing rags to make you pretty by design Rusting armour for effect It's not fun to watch the rust grow For it will all be over when you're dead  Counting acts and clutching thoughts  By the river where the moss grows  Over rocks the water running all the time Is it wicked when you smile Even though you feel like crying Even though you could be sick at any time?

      "i'm not your rag doll"   there's some things she just wont understand. Babsy went out shopping and bought me this skirt, it's not ugly per-say, it's all about taste. And the skirt is not in my taste. "come-on allyson, just try it on, look, it's even by ralgh lauren" like that will convince me more? I don't know how many times i have to tell her to stop buying me clothing. She wants me to be something I'm not, something store bought, a cut out from fassion magazine. It breaks her little heart that i'm not. She's asked me at least 10 times in the past 20 minutes to try on the damned skirt. why doeesn't she understand this? I'M MY OWN PERSON!!!! fuck, i know i should get so emotional over this but it's just another example of my relationship with my mom. I'm everything she never wanted. well, almost everything she never wanted. I can't even bear to think what she'd do or say if she knew the truth about me. Sometimes i just want to fit in around here, i mean, it is my family, my only family. I can understand that i've become a huge dissapointment, so can't she just leave me be already, excomunicate me, whatever, i don't care. i just wish she would stop shsoving her culture down my throat. I don't force anything of mine to her. It doesn't really bother me that she's not interested in anything in which i'm pasionate about. I respect that she isn't part of my culture, and i respect her and her ideals. why can't she respect mine. she never misses a cue to insult me and what i enjoy. whe doesn't miss a cue to remove me from the situations that make me the happiest. and the worst part is, when i'm miserable because i've made a bad decision in my life, she's happy, because i'm living like a normal 16 year old in her minds eye. I don't  try to let her down on purpose, i don't try to be different, it's just the way i am. I just wish she's respect that and leave me alone. And she doesn't even know who I am, but then very few actually do know. but what would she do if she knew i was... well. this is altogether too impersonal. i'm sorry, but ask me if you'd like to know, i'll probably tell you, and even if you don't ask about that certain truth... you'll find out soon enough, the truth is beginning to seep through.  there are mascara tear streaks down my cheeks. I wear make up becase it hides who i am. it reflects my internal struggles externally. As said before, i'm kinda hiding something about myself, so in turn, i'll hide my face behind this paint. the streaks only show the pain.   i'm reverting back to my old vices, old escapes.

      plural(s) sometimes i can have very bad judgement, that's all i can say. but that's not all i will say. Let's call it the stupid thing i did in sophomore year. Freshman year my stupid thing was drinking so much i got alcohol poisoning and blacked out for...5 or 6 hours? Everyone has a stupid thing they do every year, well, I just choose the most outragerous thing every school year, or most memorably stupid thing in this case. This year, well... do i really need to go there?  One morning i woke up and said "what the hell am i doing? what on earth was i thinking" and then it just too will, strenght, whatever you want to call it. I hate being mean, it just happens sometimes. But being mean is a hell of a lot better than being an asshole to all my friends and losing my personality to nothing, nothing. (in my mind i'm picturing a whisp of air) But now I'm back to my senses and mostly back to the person i was before, the person i liked. The one i had finally found. Back to the good times, a bit different yes, but good. as it were, i'm happy, could it really be?    But now I’m confused. Is this deepth really you? Do these dreams have any meaning? No.  No, I think it's more like a ghost that's been following us both. Something vague that we're not seeing, something more like a feeling. ~ Bright Eyes, Something Vauge   I'm caught in a bit of a cycle, if you were to imagine, a hamster wheel. no, that's entirely incorrect, scratch that image. think of... a rock tumbler. I'm caught inside. Not one of those risgusting rocks that come out looking gorgeous, I'm just a bit of 'matter' stuck intide. but i get thrown around and around with all the rock bits rubbing up against my sides, slowly wearing me down as well. The more lies I shed, the more bits of rocks there are to injure my sides as i spin round and round. So the cycle, I'm slowly leaking the truth, except that's not entirely true, not yet at least. I'm clearing up some lies, some things in my life that weren't true. when all of those... preceptions are gone, then maybe i'll spread the truth, it will be like a small brush fire, but one it takes wind everyone will know, which is kind of why i keep it a secret, or mostly a secret. I couldn't sit in class with a fire around my ankles. So the cycle continues and continues, I'm losing my will to stay with it, but maybe i'll come out new. not a new person, but a true person. if this were to make sense I'd be proud, but i have a feeling i've dug myself into the gound by speaking. oh well. this is me.  whisper voiced (12:00:48 PM): i need to locatea t 25 ft long telephone cord today toodals426 (12:02:02 PM): i'm going to target i think whisper voiced (12:02:15 PM): mecca! whisper voiced (12:02:24 PM): i think i'm going to hunt one down at radio shack whisper voiced (12:02:44 PM): i should wear protective gloves, i hear that they bite toodals426 (12:03:06 PM): LOL toodals426 (12:03:37 PM): they do  I still haven't gotten the cord either. i need that cord. i really really really really need it. oh well... life's rough i guess. actually i really shouldn't be complaining (i'm not really complaining either. *shrugs*) because i still have my laptop to play online with. but once you have the whole grapefruit, why settle for only half.

      Today is senoir skip day, which means I'm in schol and studying for a killer french test I have to take in 45 minutes. I've come to the library in hopes of studying, but I know that will never get done. I've got the book open on my lap and I'm hoping some of the knowledge will seep up into my brain without any effort. But I know that this will never happen so I'm reading, and raeding, and re-reading, and avoiding the nun because I'm out of dress code (as aways) Really I'm just avoiding the nun and writting here pretending to study. Mleh, I hate french. Well not exactly, I love the language, it's just my teacher has something against me, I swear she's out to get me. I may be over playing this whole thing, she doesn't realy like anyone (i think she looks like a horse, which isn't exactly an insult in my book, but it's worth noting) that class is emotionally distressing to me. Which is exactly why I'm taking psycology and sociology instead of french next year.    Word of the Day for Monday May 10, 2004  sentient \SEN-shee-uhnt; -tee-; -shuhnt\, adjective: 1. Capable of perceiving by the senses; conscious. 2. Experiencing sensation or feeling.   I'm a geek sometimes, I get the word of the day e-mailed to myself everyday. It makes for good conversation. I still haven't gotten the new cord for my computer, which saddens me because lsat night a made a really nice layout because I'm thinking of having a web page again (during the summer at least)and I want to uplaod it. I was originally thinkint of buying one today, but now i'm planing on going down to fisherman's warf and playing dance dance revolution with casey. We wanted to make doing that a weekly ritual, but then i got sun burned and well, i had other distractions and expectations which I wont get into. But now that i'm alive and breathing again (yes, i finally went and got my meds after 2 months without them).  Liberation station.   but DDR is the bomb, last time casey and I spent like... a lot of money on it. I'm thinking of buying mateo's play station and the play station version of the game so that I can play in the comforts of my living room. ....I'm not obsessed.... *hangs head*  Okay, back to studying... On classifie les hotels en France et dans les Departements d'Outre-Mer selon le confort qu'ils offre a la clientele. Le classification d'hotels peut vous indiquer les services qu'offre un hotel (restaurants, piscines, ect.), la qualite du logement et le prix des chambres. A l'exterieur d'un hotel francais, vous pouvez voir un certain nombre d'etoiles. Plus il y a d'etoiles, plus l'hotel est confortable.  meh, i don't feel like writting any more about this french crap. we're studying how to take vacations on the sea (le mer) and have to write essays about hotels and whatnot. very very boring. maybe i'll start writting my blog entries in another language, that could be fun....? perhaps. eh, too much effort. now i really do have to study becase lunch ends in 10 minutes and i have to pass this test.

      Hm, a moment ago I had something to write here, that notion is gone. I guess I'll just post a poem-ish thing i wrote a few hous ago.   Sometimes I sit upon a hill and think Wouldn’t it be nice to get out of this place But I’m only thinking to myself.  It’s a lonely lonely world out there And I’m pulling in all my walls Guard me please, I don’t want to see the stars But the moon has risen, and raped the land below Everyone is so uptight, they don’t even open their eyes to watch The scores of colours and the swirling of the leaves I’m waiting for the sun to rise I’m waiting all alone for my myself to find myself I’m lost in a world I once claimed my own  Sometimes I sit on that hill and make wishes To all those below who will never hear I’ve got my fears, I keep them to myself  I keep to myself  With the glues sticks and torn up pictures I piece together the world as I see fit Picture here, drawing there, a little dribble of paint Creating the scenery that fills my eyes A change of location, a change of heart.  I was always that way, I just was too scared to look Just open your eyes The stars are fading now as the sun kisses the hills Wake up wake up.   Sometimes I sit upon that hill and think What a wonderful place this is Why do I need to escape, a bird caught in wire I’ll call it a vacation time, because I do plan on returning some day The hill that over looks the city, the city by the bay I still need to get out, get away, fly away A change of scenery, a valley to close my eyes in A grassy field all my own, peaceful wind  I’ll keep to myself because I need to be alone. I keep to myself because I am lonely  “And when the planets align, there will be no planets to align” Lyrics from songs float through my mind Half lived dreams and more so than none This is not mine, why do I hold it in my hand And I flew away, I plan to, I plan to I need to leave this hill, I need to leave these expectations Not quite who I appear, nothing is ever really clear I mentioned it once, in a half hearted laugh I joke so no one gets hurt And then everyone gets let down I’m sorry   I'm not really sure what i was thinking about if anything. It's just one of those nights. I'm sitting on my bed right now listening to OK Computer on repeat. Only the music is very very soft and i can barely hear it over the howling wind outside. I love weather. the rain especially, but wind is nice too. the wind will put me to sleep tonight, which makes me very happy. so good night little dukies.

      Sundays always bring me down quite a bit. Today was no different, I awoke late as usual, I had stayed up too late the night before and was compensating by sleeping in, although the sleeping in never happened. See, today was mothers day, although I'm normally not a part of this family I felt compelled to fill my old role for once. I made myself roll out of bed at 8:00 and I clumsily climbed my hill in my pajamas to buy flowers for my mom. I nearly tripped walking back down; walking with your eyes closed can be dangerous.  She enjoyed the flowers, I also gave her a painting I made a month or so ago. I had seen her eyeing it on my desk while I was painting it. Since I never really have any money I figured I'd give it to her, she's moving into her remodeled office in a week or so, so I figured she could put it up there.   The rest of the morning I spent in my room trying to fall back asleep, that actually never happened, I just made my bed and discovered the remnants of a blue smiley face rubbed into my pillowcase. That's one of the best surprises in the morning, reminders of the night before in your bed. For me that's usually sand of some sort, or marker rub-offs that once indicated that I was under 21, and thus banned from the bar.  Later on I drove Babsy dear over to Mill Valley to go hiking, she's a fan of mild hiking. We hike 4 miles maybe, it was nice, but I had ulterior motives. The specific place we went, Tennessee Valley, has a small little bunker way up upon a hill, last time I was there with Loni and Steve we explored up into the bunker, there was lot’s of graffiti on the walls, artsy graffiti. When I left my house I remembered to bring paints with me, and so I added my own artwork to the bunker. "I'm going to pretend that I didn't see that" Babsy wasn't too approving when she dunked in to see what I was up to and to ask to borrow my camera.   Now I've just got a huge headache and a ban from the internet. I'm not really looking forward to school tomorrow because I have a French test that I’m going to fail and some other test in a class I can't remember. Also I've got to do that biology thing I've been skipping for the past week, I'm surprised that Dr. Hicks doesn't hate me yet for skipping so many times, Biology is a waste time. mleh.   Right now I'd give anything to be sitting in a dimly lit café sipping on some tea. That was my summer existence last year; I never had much to do so I entertained myself by going to cafés. Sometimes I'd play chess if Nick or Chad were around, but I'd mostly sit and drink tea and write on my computer. I started writing a story back then, it's different from the one I'm writing currently because it was more abstract than anything, I should really try and find that story, I remember liking it quite a bit. I miss the café atmosphere, I got to know everyone in this small café near my house, they're closed now and the new café just isn't the same, sigh. I'll find my new niche soon enough. Lately I've been taking my laptop to the park a lot, it used to make me nervous, I'm not really the nervous type, but I always imagined a stray soccer ball flying into the screen while I was deeply caught up in what I was writing. But that's never happened.   Oh, I just remember, the other test is on Brave New World, I really like the book but I need to read two more chapters for tomorrows test, I should get on that later tonight. I like to read a lot before I go to sleep; I’ve found it helps with my insomnia.   My insomnia has actually gotten a bit better, I now can pull off sleeping maybe 4 hours a night. that still isn't the best but it's better than nothing at all. I had a good night sleep in Thursday, but since then it's been back to 4 hours. Sigh, I should probably tell Kris about that, maybe he’d be able to give me some sleeping meds. That would be nice. I've heard that you can get really vivid dreams with certain kinds. Kodachrome dreams. Oh! I have an idea.

      aklhi here (thats the new spelling of my name, i've become paranoid of babsy finding this blog, so if she searches google or something, she wont find it under a psudenim (sp?) also, this is just the new spelling), let me tell you about my day, saturday that is. because in my mind it still is saturday. well, today was grand. i haven't used that phrase in a while. but today was amazingly great in it's simplicity, or complexity.  "you're on top of the world again"  I hung out with julia for a whil,e then george camea nd picked us up in his yellow volvo. we drove around for awhile, we tried to go to ameoba but there was no parking. sometimes cars suck in that sense, parking. mleh. so we drove around and screamed out the windows. Then we went to hear hansel. they were playing at club 18 which is at the jcc. it was great, grand. it was like old time,s the good times. homely. it was good for my mental health. I left around 11.   i don't really feel like writting a lenghtly entry about the state that i'm in, har har, the state that i am in. i;m listening to tigermilk right now by the way. tigermilk was my favorite belle and sebastian a few weeks ago, i'm not relaly sure which one is my favorite right now. I really like stay loose off of dear catastrophe waitress. But right now I've got boy with teh arab strap in my stereo, it's been my alarm clock for the past few days. it's all fancy pants, shoes i mean.

      today's max's birthday, he got an iPod from my mom, he was overjoyed, then remembered that he had no music on his computer and cuddled up with me in bed to ask if he could take my music (i have 12.3GB on mine) it was his birthday so i had to say yes. Later i'm taking him to best buy to buy him the indaver zim dvd. It used to be both our favorite tv show, then it got cancelled. sadness. he'll like that, i also bought him a Ramones cd the other day, he liked that too.   I went to virgin downtown with babsy, she said she'd get me a confirmation present, i was so happy. I decided i'd get the white album, i laready have it, but it's... i can't incriminate myself here, but yeah. so i got that and...! AND!!!!  AND!!!!   THE DEVO DVD!!!!  oh it was so so so so happy, it was the last one there. It has 19 different videos on it, i called lisa as soon as i got home to tell her about it. we're planning a DEVO party for next saturday, all the cool kids are invited. the perfect nine. it should be great. lot's of devo, fun people. and pie. what more could you need? except maybe a monkey named walter.

      i'm writting a song right now, did i mention that. I haven't written or done anything very musical since 8th grade when i first started learning the guitar. i doubt i'll ever finish it, i seem to have a problem finishing most things.   I made art today, yes, real art, not food sculptures, or body drawings, real art. I'm getting back into that groove again, staying up until 4 in the morning, huntched over with paint in my hair and my fingers permenantly wrapped around a paintbrush. I don't know what drives my insomnia anymore, but some very interesting art has emerged from it.  i've been listening to the modest mouse cd for the past few hours, it's good, the first time i heard a song off this record was on the radio, live105, i was really pissed off, "fucking sellouts" not modest mouse, no, not modest mouse. but the record is really good, it's not just a one hit record.  i hate sitting home on a friday night, but tonight i wouldn't even want to go out if i had a car. there was a bon fire thing i was possibly going to, and then some other party as well, but honestly, i just don't have the energy. i'm out of caffine pills, and have no other stimulants accessable at the moment. I may climb into bed fairly soon. i feel like i've been scuring from one thing to another all week, like everything is on fast foward and i'm stuggling to keep up, i need some time off. i really wish this weekend was the three day weekend instead of next weekend. oh well.  tomorrow is my brother's 13th birthday, i bought him a ramones cd, i think he'll like that. my mom got him an iPod, i know he'll really like that, he's been asking for one since christmas almost, well, maybe just the past month, it just  seems  forever.  sunday is my confirmation, i'm going to have to work later that night as well. i have to work on monday and tuesday too. mleh, i hate working, but i get money, and i need money so i can keep up my cd and milk buying habbits. hahahahahahahaha, no one will understand that joke.   okay i lied before, i do wnat to go out right now, but i want to go drive up to mt. dave, but alone, i don't want to be around people tonight, unless they stay really quiet and had no expectations. i'm rambling, i'll stop.

      I rolled over and hit my head on my desk, "fuck" i say to myself, it's that time again. slowly, and this time carefully i gut up out of bed, another sleepless night. my eyes seem a bit out of focus, i blink a few times and my room comes into view, more specifiacally, my bottle of caffine pills comes into view. I was at that point, clinically insane, 72 hours without sleep, i reach for the bottle to ensure i stayed awake during the school day.   I was a mess getting ready for school, i was tripping left and right, and if you asked me i probably couldn't tell the different between left and right. It was dress us day at school so had to look nice, "dressy" I wore my blue and white skirt as i had been thinking about, it was fun. I was really tempted to wear my knee socks, but i couldn't find my blue ones anywhere and i was really rushed for time, so rushed that i forgot my wallet and keys on my desk.  Five minutes into the school day i got detention for wearing the wrong shoes. oh well, i would have ended up there anyway. it had been about two weeks sincem y last detainment so i was starting to wonder what was wrong. I went to the senior awards ceremony (didn't have a choice) it was nice, really long, but nice. I spent most of the time talking with chris and casey and braiding casey's hair with kevie.  Lunch was crazy, correction, i was crazy at lunch, the caffine pills were hitting me full force then, i was so extreamly hyper, i think it was getting annoying too. I got my yearbook at lunch and that's all.  During french i had to go see mr. dean man, that wasn't too fun, but while i was walking down the hill some of the baseball players started singing "i'm to sexy for allyson, too sexy for allyson" i thought it was extreamly funny, they didn't have shirts on either. it almost convinced me never to wear a skirt again, at least not to school.  after school i went to a meeting about a costa rica trip for next year to save the turtles. mark, casey, and nick were there too. then i cut detention and made casey come home with me because she has a copy of my house key. i got my wallet and other things. i decided to change my shoes and wear pink steletos, a very bad choice but oh well.  we left and went to haight street to purchuse "a carton of milk" i wandered around wasteland for a while, there are a pair of pants i really want to get there. i bought the new modest mouse cd "good news for people who love bad news" and casey and i went to the park to converse. "4 out 5 hippies smile", i smile "4 out of 5 hippies come back" i give away the remains of my milk, sigh. i love golden gate park.   Casey and I departed and I picked Julia up at 7:00 so we could go to Lisa's Baccalaureate Mass at school. we got there a little late, my feet were hurting a whole lot by then. the mass was alright, i saw too many people in my grade there for my comfort, but it was alright. I stole Sean's honor, but eventually had to give it back, and julia abused mr. daniels, it was great...! then babsy picked me up at one point, we went to safeway around 10:30 to buy fruit for a fruit salad. i was really bored so i took the shopping cart and pushed myself around singing fake pastic trees. my tibute to radiohead. babsy eventually told me to stop acting childish. oh well, it was fun.  I just got home a little while ago so i should probably start my homework. I have to work after school tomorrow. i hella hate that i have to work on a friday, but i really need the money.

       My flower would not unfold, always waiting for some sunnier day. quiet and patient, but afraid and hidden away. and the awful truth's been told, matter of fact and i can't take it back and I wouldn't want to, or at least that's what I say.   I'm sitting in my bed right now, i'm not really tired but i have to wake up in 5 and a half hours because i plan on going swimming in the morning. i just finished typing up my homework, it was boring and dull, i was too lazy to use my thresuarus so it's the same boring old words i use all the time. i still have to study for my french test, but that will come later, maybe in the morning. i honest don't care about the test, i don't care if i fail french anymore, i just don't care. i really shouldn't be taht appathetic towards french, i'm propably getting a c in it right now, maybe a d because i was doing even worse at the beginning of the quarter. oh well, not like i care.      wish you gave me a number wish i could call you today, just to hear a voice.  i got a long way to go getting further away. if i didn't know the difference,  living alone would probably be ok. it wouldn't be lonely. i got a long way to go getting further away.

      I've been listening to Cat Stevens all morning. All afternoon really, I was listening to Sigur Ros all morning and all of last night, I purposely left it on repeat to keep me company. My room was really cold last night, but I threw the covers off in a sweat, something here is wrong. So I put on Cat Stevens a little while ago to change my mood, sometimes music can do that, so far... I guess it's been succesful, but I've got a belle and sebastian song stuck in my head all the same.    Oh, you care I know You care I know You care I know I forgot for a while . . . . On a sulky afternoon spent in dispute you'll give yourself a headache, yeah So I spend the day in stories and in dreaming of the time when we're on stage

       it's like waking up from a bad dream, only the dream isn't bad at all, just stable. This morning as I walkind in the Franklin st. door and walk onto the 3rd floor to go to my locker, I stop, a dead stop. "There is no one here" I check my watch, 7:22, okay, a little early, but no earlier than ususal. I was baffled, I went to my locker and see some of Lisa's things, oh right, senoirs. They don't have any more classes and don't have to be at school until noon. The 3rd floor is strickly for student council members and senoirs. Every morning there would be the same senoirs living their lifes against the walling in that hall. Rob would be sprawled out somewhere taking a nap, others would be working on homework, or sitting in circles just existing. Now there is no one, there's nobody to say "watch your head" to as I open my locker. No more anything. I had already been thinking about change this morning, the time change, and yes, it was a while ago, but it's never really dark in the morning anymore. Back in november and december when I would get to school at 7:00 for morning detention (i had that a lot) it would still be really dark. The school was practically asleep, i would have to enter through the Gough st. gate because everything else was still locked. The thing about that gate was that it had lights under it, to light the entrance, they'd be on, i haven't seen them on since then. There was a certain beauty to that darkness, one i can't quite explain.  Today, this morniing was very pensive, i'm wearing my oversized black zip up jacket today, i haven't worn it since the beginning of sophmore year. I'm wearing it out of desperation of course, i can't exactly wear short sleaved clothing anymore, for more than one reason. I've always hated this jacket from the start, but i wore it anyway. I remember in freshman year i would wear it with my red striped polo and black tie, the tie has been confiscated and the polo is probably around somewhere. I remember one night in particular that i wore this jacket. It was a night over one year ago. Two of my old aquantences and I had been frociling about the Cathedral Hill Hotel selling ballons we had previously freed from Mels across the street. We met these two guys on a high school trip for a broadcast thing (details about that have faded). They wanted to smoke so we took them to golden gate park, the childrens playground. I remember complaining about my jacket so much that chris from santa fe gave me his, it was a nice jacket too, courderoy and everything. There was another time that i passed out in the jacket over the summer and woke up with patches sewn onto it. wierd expirence.  enough about rants on clothing items, enough with rants in general, i go on rants, or tangents way too often. I now don't even recall what i was originally set out to write about. no, it wasn't the dreamlike state of this morning and no senoirs, it was something, something, oh i'll never remember at this rate.  written at 7:30 while waiting for school to start (or for casey to come)

       Everybody wants to be everybody, can’t you see, everybody wants to be everybody. Don’t know that you’re free  Not the best place to be sitting at this moment, but at least it’s a breather. My house was getting really claustrophobic today. I painted my nails incandesant blue/purple to take away my peeling blues, of course it didn’t work, and now I’m stuck with distracting nails, I think I’ll remove the paint when I get home.   This morning I went to Sunday school as requested, I crowned Mary during church, I had to climb this little foot stool and place a drown of flowers on the statues head. Somewhere in one of my religion classes in the past two years I remember learning that there was no idolatry allowed in the catholic religion… yet we’re allowed to crown statues and sing songs to them… Some things just aren’t adding up here, if that isn’t idolizing, then I don’t know what its? Anyway, after mass I had to hang around to do my confirmation practice, I can’t believe I still have to do this dispite everything, on the bright side, I’ll never have to go back to church after I do this. My mom will feel her parental role of guidance (hmm?) will be fulfilled.   Around 1 or actually, I think it was a wee bit closer to 2, I got tired of sitting in my room. I’ve been trying to finish off all these different art projects that I’ve been working on lately. But it wasn’t working out as I wanted. Since there was mass about of art supplies on my desk I ended up making some bizarre collages,  which was a way of finishing something, but not what I wanted to get done. I’ve got deadlines all around me, but none of which I plan on fulfilling at the moment. I already missed out on the art show at my library, it sneaks up on me every year. I was pretty mad when I found out I’d missed that, it took a lot of wandering to cool down.  So I left my house with this lovely laptop and my camera. I was going on my own field trip. It was nice, right now I’m in Doloras Park. I would always pass by this park late at night when I was taking the long way home on the busses.   Oh I have a tangent. Something I love about San Francisco, the busses. Okay, I actually hate them at times, but that’s only when I’m in a rush, or super tired. There are so many ways to take the bus home from school. Well, most of the time I’m not coming from school, but that’s a completely different tangent on which I wont expand. Back when I was on set crew for the play I would stay at school until 6:00. Most days I got a ride almost all the way home from Isabel. But sometimes I would also take the bus. There was one way I’d really like taking when it was dark out. Most people believed I went this way because it was “safer”, they thought that I didn’t like waiting in the tenderloin for my bus home. I really didn’t mind waiting there, and I always had great conversations at that bus stop. Oh I remember once, I was at that bus stop at 11:00 pm, there was the old women who was telling me about her son who became a millionaire, I didn’t really believe her at the time, I still don’t, but she was nice and bought me cigarettes. But people there are so open to talking, telling stories, sometimes I envy that, I’m a horrible storyteller. Anyway, back to the original tangent. I would take the underground out to 24th street and take the bus home from there. It was the most beautiful route at night because when the train passed the park you could see so many lights in the city, there was just a special force inside of me that made that sight really contemplative every time I saw it. I also would take the bus home through the mission that way, there are nice lights along mission too. I used to walk down 24th street very late at night with some old aquantences of mine. We’d get offered a wide assortment of drugs from passing cars, but the lights were so beautiful, they’d fill my soul.   It’s getting a bit nippy out, it was never exactly warm today, but it wasn’t cold. Now it’s windy, which is making me rather cold as I wasn’t smart enough to bring a sweater with me, only my bare arms. I think I’m going to go and buy myself some lunch, maybe I’ll get a burrito, it feels like that kind of day. Oh! And if I go over to the burrito place of my choice I can pop in streetlight records and get the new modest mouse CD. Or actually, I want to buy a Donovan CD really badly. Options I’ll weigh out on my journey. Goodbyes for now.

      1:42 PM Well, I’m assuming that I’ll be transcribing this into my online journal later on today, so keep this in mind, I’m in geometry class right now, the class I don’t really have to take. It’s been really hard for me to sit through this class a lot lately, so I’m wearing Casey’s sweatshirt so I can hide my CD player, I’m listening to Tigermilk right now, it’s hard to fight off my urges to dance. Today has been rather melancholy, well, not exactly, I’ve actually been really happy all day. It’s one of those things, when something, like yesterday for example, happens that is so wonderful, so much fun, so inexplicable mesmerizing. The next day is spent in a post-high so to speak. So even if today is fabulous, if it’s not as exciting as the day before it’s just… lacking. I know I’m not really making much of any sense, but then again, when do I ever? I keep fantasizing about this summer, I was really scared about this summer for awhile, I was scared that I’d slip into my old depression and isolate myself. I was scared about going to L.A. for CSSSA, for many reasons, like expectations, for how I’d act down there, who I’d act with, many things in conglomeration. But now, I’m excited as hell, the whole fear thing has dissolved into a very nice tasting cocktail. Okay, I know I mentioned fantasy in the beginning of this thought, so let me explain that. Fantasy, something that’s not really real, a dream land I guess, but that’s not how I meant it. When I used to dream about the summer, I’d dream very possible situations, both exciting and dreary, but they’d scare me because I wasn’t sure if I’d be able to fit into my shoes in them, that I wasn’t the person I saw in the dreams. My stomach would clench in dread, regret, dismay, all those things you don’t really want to associate with on a normal basis. But now, although they remain the same fantasies, same dreams, visions, whatever you want to call them. They don’t scare me so much anymore. Now the dread and anxiety about them has vanished. I’m not sure if that clarified the concept or not, but that’s all I’ve got on it. The summer here in S.F. will be wonderful, I’ve got my friends, the cali chix, just everything will be a beautiful abstract drawing, chalk full of meaning and wonderment. And in L.A. for CSSSA, well, I’m not so scared about that anymore, I’m going down there alone, without any strings or acquaintances, a clean me. There will be no expectations of me down there, no former knowledge, no nothing. And the thing I was most scared about, I was scared I’d have to prove myself, to people around me. Not prove that I deserved to be there, but that I was a person. But I don’t feel that way anymore. And yes, I’m purposely being vague.   New subject. I just looked at the clock, there are 20 minutes left in this class and the school day. “you know my wandering days are over” there’s nothing I’m looking for anymore, I’ve found and have all I want. Well well, aren’t I being pretentious today? But really, I’ve been lonely for a really long time, I always had though I needed a “significant other” to make that loneliness go away, well, I tried that a few times. The most recent attempt only made the loneliness and emptiness increase day by day, I think that’s why I ended that. So recently I’ve come to terms with many things, but what I’ve finally been able to accept is that my friends aren’t going to abandon me, I’ve beaten the cycle of my mind telling me to pull away, to not trust anyone.  And it’s been very liberating, so “my wandering days are over” I’m no longer looking for anything (or anyone) to make me happy. And although it’s taken me a while to get here I couldn’t be happier that I did. Now to tackle the next obstacle on my journey to nirvana.  And now it’s freedom time so I will click my shoes together three times and end this transmission.    2:52 PM transmission number two (for you blue) I’m on the bus right now, if I weren’t in a rush I’ve get off this bus for a more pleasant driver. It’s one of those jerky busses, and it smells to boot. But that’s okay, I’m not really in a picky mood today after all. There is a guy sitting across the way from me, he has glasses like the ones Clark would wear during performance nights. He just left but he had the same shoes on as me, blue vans. It’s just one of those moments, where you can watch people in the city, take written photographs without them knowing, there is no one else on the bus of particular interest. I’m riding through the mission district right now. Arguably one of my favorite  wandering spots in the city. Although, I really enjoy this place a lot more in the early morning or late at night, it was beautiful last night. Hm. 25th and mission, there is one of my favorite burrito places in the city, I’m wondering if I should get off and nip a bite to eat or not. No, not today, I don’t think I’ve got any money anyway. I’ve just got a bunch of ID cards from all my friends and notes from Casey and Lindsey. I love writing notes to people, although, there have been a few instances that I’ve forced myself to write notes to people I don’t really like, well, that I just can’t really connect with. Notes are kind of a sacred thing to me, I hate when I have to BS through a note, so instead I just don’t write it. I’ve become really comfortable with who I am, and I know this is actually pretty random subject to bring up. I’ve finally found myself, I was trying to explain it earlier I think. But I’m fully comfortable with my actions, I have no regrets and for once I really mean that. I really do feel comfortable, like whatever I do is who I am, without explanations. So ask me anything you want, and for once I’ll answer with a truth, a real truth instead of my normal non-shalant “I don’t know” trailing off into space. Well, I’m just about at lisa’s now so this is the end. ( I think of the doors song, “this is the end my friend”)

      well, it's 12:45, i got out of school 25 minutes ago and in am now in my school library. i had detention for "skipping" part of pre-cal, that was pretty painless, just picking up trash and nw i'm free for the rest of the day. everyone else is still in class until 1:15, so i'm going to wait here until they get out so we can hang out.   as i was sititng here just now i remembered something my computer teacher said last year in class one day. i actually don't remember what she said, but i remember she was talking about hw teh school can read whatever you write in e-mails if you use a school computer. i was thinking about this because i wanted to write about what i did yesterday, and why i was missing in action for quite some time. but i don't know if it's safe or not so ill refrain until i get home.   but in the meantime i'll do something construction, perhaps? parhaps? i should be working on my biology extra credit project, i don't really have to do it since i've got an a in the class, i would just rather do it because i have a tendancy to forget my homework every now and then and dr. hicks doesn't accept late work. so it's my.... safety net? yeah. i'm supposed to research mollusca, whatever the hell that is and write an essay about it.  but i'm not really in the homeworky mood, and my eyes hella hurt as well.   Last night i went to sleep at 7:00, do you know what kind of record that is for me??? seriously, i've got insomnia, i normally can't fall alseep until 3 or 4, and even when i didn't have insomnia i would go to slee around 12. sowhat's up with the whole 7:00 thing? i woke up a few times during hte night because max kept turning hte heater on to 85 and i was sweating like a fat kid in summer, so i kept on stummbling out of bed and turning it off. then i woke up at 5:30 and did all my homework because i'd neglected it the night before. today has been extreamly clear, "so this is what i'm supposed to feel like everyday" it's not like i'm hyper, i'm just not tired, not even a litle bit, and i like it, i like it a lot. babsy was giving me problems this morning, she think's somethings wrong because i went to sleeps early. last time this happened, well, almost happened (i took a nap early on, but then she woke me up for dinner and i had to much work to go back to sleep) she asked me if i was doing drugs. which i wasn't, because i don't. but i find it funny that the one day i live healthy, and get a healthy amount of sleep she gives me problems about it. sihg... life is so ironic sometimes.  my foot is really falling alseep right now. every time i come to use the computers in the library, which isn't very often, i alway sit indian style, crosslegged, however ou want to call it. and after a little while my feet always fall asleep. i've got this suspician that i've got low blood pressure. a few weeks ago when i stayed home from school for half the week i went to the doctor because i couldn't stand up without fainting, he said that whatever i had was making me have low blood pressure and... what was the rest... anyways, i took a pill it got better. but wo knows. i'm just writting to take up time. i'd really like to skip over to the park right now nad have a nice... sit. but everyone gets out in 5 minutes so i'll wait here.    Word of the Day for Wednesday May 26, 2004     cap-a-pie \cap-uh-PEE\, adverb:    From head to foot; at all points.    ohkay, my attention span is going. i'm wearing lisas shoes since she took my slipons *shakes fist at lisa* i might have to turn emo one day and sit in a corner and write a song about it.... or not. because i'm not emo. "three emos and an indie" thats the band.  it's kinda breezy in here (loosey goosey, loosey goosey)

      i feel like i'm not in my body right now, it's hard to explain exactly or perhaps i just don't know evactly what it is i'm expirencing to describe it and have any truth visable to me. after all, this whole online diary thing is for me, did you know that? me. i like to write too much, this is just where i go when there is over flow. i guess i'm talking about my writting now. i'm writting a book (i think it's a book, i mainly refer to it as my manuscript) i'm not entirely sure what my expectations for it are, or even if i've got any expectations. i started rereading it last night, there is quite a bit done so i haven't finished my rereading, and i noticed i changed certain attibutes around a few times. not attributes exactly, i'm not sure what to call it, but sometimes it's appearent that i was in a certain mood when i was writting certain parts. my voice changes i guess. i need to work on that, or just go over and make things smoother. loose like that. i think the book will be for me, well, not  for  me, but for my sanity, besides, i'd be really surprised if anyone else ever read it, or was even interested in reading it. i'm not making much sense today, let's change the subject.  after school i hung out with casey and lidnsay for a wee bit, we too a nice littel stroll through the park, it ended horribly, well in my mind i was distressed. my french teacher saw me as i cross the street, she was a few steps behind. and i'm only distressed because i'm not worried about her seeing me. i really should be worried, but once again my apathy has taken ahold of my controls. then i went home with casey to a lisa who was sleeping in my bed.( i was about to but in a whitty quote from an online conversation, but i decided against that) casey and i climbed in bed with her to wake her up, then we all baked pie. i took a shower today, i was getting the feeling that no one around me was appreciating that i hadn't showered in 10 days. mleh. i was going to babysit and want to get invited back, so i guess i was thinking about that.   i feel like spilling today, i'm reading tomorrow, oh i'm really dreading tomorrow. last week, egh, i don't even want to think about it. tuesdays are psycologist days. last week i came out crying, not because of what he said, but because everyone such fucking idiots. well, he is i guess, not noticing anything. i kept trying to talk about things that were really bothering me, things that i had been cutting myself over and he just changed the subject to meditaion and my sleeping problem. i feel like i'd really like to be more straightfoward and just tell him what i want, but he can be really unaccepting, unresponsive. anyway, i came out upset so i stalked all the way to haight street to buy cigarettes to ease my mind. and now, well, there's not much more to that story.  so i'm not looking foward to tomorrow. i might ditch my session, just leave school early like i normally do to go to my session, but instead go do something else, something productive, something to ease my mind. i already have that horrible churning feeling in my stomach about tomorrow. and i've got to work tomorrow too, this sucks.  wednesday i want to have fun. NO MATTER WHAT. i'm either going to have a peusedo party at my house, although i'd rather not. or go hang out with my friends and loose my sanity, my stability. i will go on. i just need to have fun, okay, i have fun all the time, but it's always cut short by something. wednesday will be my day to just have fun. plain and simple, no worrying about homework, or curfews, or anything. i'm rambling i know, but this is important to me. i think?  come by when you get off school i'll be sitting around out back just kicking the pebbles in the dirt in my own way i'll be away but you can always bring me back bring me back, oh bring me back  i'll stop by when i get off work hoping to find something that has been gone you'll know me by clouds that surround so hang a right, come by anyway i'll take you back and that's a fact and we can take a break, not quite a holiday but we can go away anyway  take a weight of your sholders you know it's well past due i'll get you away from here, set us free and we'll either be succseful or dead but you know we have a chance this isn't a declaration, but a chance turn back before it gets to late before it gets to dark, before we turn around  and i couldn't think of anything to say so i took time at the inverval to get away and that's where i'll stay until someome finds me, i'm not hiding too hard is it worth the trouble, is there any pain. i'll great you with a smile  now i'm off to bombard all my friends with pictures on the starnge invention commonly called instant messenger, i do home they enjoy the show. i've got all sorts of random pictures of me with my friends i decided that they should see them too. and as long as my school picture, or winter ball picture never meet anothers eyes, everything will be dandy, DANDY!!!!

      i feel like wandering at the moment, although it wouldn't really be wandering since i know where i want to go, it's this little place a few blocks away, casey knows it, it's just a bunch of trees where you can sit and be almost invisable. I'd like to be there right now. I'm supposed to be working right now, i feel really bad about that, i had to call in and tell them i had a little family obligation, brothers birthday and all, he seemed pretty let down. i hope he still wants me back on monday, i feel very tempremental at the moment. of course there is no family obligation, i'm just sitting in my room wishing i was out. i could easily go out right now, it's only 6, sunday curfew is 9, i think. but i'm pretty sure i've got some homework to be doing. maybe i'll go for a walk to the park on 20th and vermont. i used to go there when things were going badly.   i remember one night in particular, it was about 10, or maybe later. i was withering away in my house, i was starting to realize things would never be the same, i only saw the bad in that, in change. so i put on my suede jacket with white cuffs, grabbed my phone and sketchbook, and went for a long walk to that park. i talked to casey for a long time, i'm pretty sure i was crying while i was talking. this whole event has partially faded in my mind now, it took me almost ten minutes just to remember why i was so upset that night. i do remember now, it was about kevie and kristin, swanky times.   I always associate people with songs, i associate everything with songs. someone i new recently pointed this out to me. they always happened to start singing, or just mentioning songs i had particuarily strong feelings towards. like "brown eyed girl" the song by van morrison. my dad used to sing that to me all the time when i was little, i remember him with that song. Oh, not to go on another tangent, but once i've started thinking about something i go with it. there was another wong that i always associate with my dad. "under the boardwalk" i think it's by the drifters but i can't quite remember. when i was little i had a loft in my room. it was really justa bunck bed without a bed on teh bottem. my dad built it for me when i was 4, it was a birthday present of sorts. anyway, i remember many nights, i'd lay up against the bars keeping me from rolling off and listen to me dad sing that song to get me to fall asleep (have i always had sleeping problems?) he'd stand there, he was very tall. but was sparked the tangent was that one day i was with some friends of mine, we were waiting on line to go on a ferris wheel in golden gate park. it was pretty foggy out that day. they were singing it, i politely asked them to stop, they didn't so i asked again. i was being forceful, i'm generally pretty passive with everything, so they asked why. this was last summer by the way. i told them that the song was sacred (i really did say sacred, strange huh?) and that i'd feel better if they wouldn't sing it. i just got that look. they knew what had happened with my dad, but they didn't like to talk about it with me much, so they just changed the subject. sometimes i wish i had talked more about it when everything happened, but that's how life works.  Now i forgot why i started writting here, i hate how i distract myself so much with this writting. oh right, music association. um, i don't remember what i was going to say about that.   I haven't told many people about this plan yet, mainly because i've only just started formulating it. i'm planning to change my room around a bit. if you've never seen my room it's painted mango, i chose the colour in 8th grade, i still love it dearly. i honestly couldn't imagine my room any other colour. on a side note, my room is the only room in my entire house that is not painted white, i think that says a lot about how i fit in with my family. anyway, my plans. i was thinking about putting a wire from one end to my room to the other, high up, the long way around. then, buying sheer purple fabric, the semi see through stuff and pinning it to either side of my room and hanging it over the wire to create a purple apearing ceiling. then, once that's compleated, i'm going to buy lanturns, the chinese ones in bright colours, i was thinking red, but red has been a fantasy of mine for two years now. i originally wanted to get the kind of lanturns with light inside of them, but that is way to complex for me, and probably too heavy for the wire that i'm going to hang them on. i'm going to do this all in one day over the summer while my mom is out at work, i think if she was here while i was putting it up she'd discourage me and not let me do it. but once it's all up i think she'll let me keep it. and if she doesn't i'll keep it up anyway, just like me christmas lights designated for the summer only. i've been putting this plan off for about a month now, mainly because i haven't had more than 20 dollars in my wallet at any given time, i think this project will be costly. but i just got money for my confirmation, so i'm going to try and save it and make this project work.  i'm not really sure why i just rambled on about what i'm going to do to my room, i'm guessing this is dreafully boring. i'm painting fantasy senarios in my head right now.  max just came in here to fart. i swear he'll never grow up, but i love him all the same. it's become part of his game, i guess it's the one he plays in his head because i'm not a player, more like the victem. he likes to come in here fart, scream "safety" and run off in a fit of giggles. I normally don't mind all that much, except sometimes whne i'm in one of my painting vortexs i don't hear him sneaking up, normally the music is fairly loud as well. i'll never admit it but sometimes he really does scare me when he sneaks up.   my mom took us round the backyard earlier today, we were both dressed up max and i. I was in my lovely brown dress which i got to wear to my confirmation, really confirmation was an excuse to get myself a nice dress. so i was all dressed up, and little maxy was in black suit minus the tie. babsy kept trying to take photos of us and we kept goofing off. i really wanted to get connie in one of the pictures but "she'll muss up your dress" with a long sigh i said okay and pretended to pose, only to stick my touge out at the last moment. "allyson.... (she said with and emphasis) stop goofing off, i want to send these pictures to the grandparents" i sure one of the pictures will turn out okay. after she took about ten she asked me if i left the light meter set correctly. i just gave her a funny look started singing. max and i did the tango all over the lawn, it was pretty comical. i think i'm going to miss maxy when i go off to college, i'll have no one to interupt me, or to stay home with me when i don't feel like going out. everyone once in awhile, maybe every 2 months i have a max appreciation day where i take max where ever he wants and let him have whatever he wants. it's my way of spending time with him and showing him that i love him. i normally take him to the movies, or last time he really wanted to go to in and out burger, so we did that and played air hockey. normally when i tell people about my 'max appreciation days' they say they're sorry i have to spend the day doing what he wants, i don't think they understand  that i choose to do that, even babsy was caught off gaurd the first time i did that. it's nice to spend the day with maxy every once in a while. it's like being a kid again.  i just found my membership card to the legion of honor and the de young museum. i'm pretty sure it expired last month, which means i'll need to renew it. i really want to see the art deco exhibit at the legion of honor. but it's a drag getting to the museum, but i guess it wont be so hard when i have my license. i'm thinking about joining MOMA as well, i used to have some kind of membership there abouta year or two ago. i'd go there on rainy days after school and sketch differnt exhibits. back when i was really passionate about my artwork, i'm starting to get that way again. if anyone wants to go to either museums with me let me know, we'll make a day out if it.  i was reading something online earlier about treasure hunts. i remember in 8th grade i planned a huge treasure hunt in my neighborhood for my birthday. but then the actual day turned out to be 97 degrees out with is a huge rareity for san francisco so i decided i wasn't going to make my friends climb around my hill for an hour in the heat. but i want to have a real treasure hunt soon, during the summer before i go off to art school. i'll need to get a few other people involved in planning it, it can be a city wide search ending... who knows, somewhere nice. treasure hunts are fantastically fun, but only if everyone else is into it as well, i guess i'll have to ask around and see who's interested.    ENOUGH!

      Today's rather dreary, this morning i was confirmed, it was a nice little quait ceremony. I like my church well enough, i do the readings there every 4 weeks, i'm not really very religous, if i had more time, and perhaps energy, i'd look into converting to hinduism, because it really fastinates me, i thank john trapasso. i feel more connected to it's beliefs that the catholic beliefs, but it's good to be involved in something.  my mom took me out to crepes on cole par my request. it was to celebrate, hooray!  I've been listening to camera obscura all morning, i think things like that can effect my moods. i've been painting as well, nothing much that i like, but it's all about the process right? i need to go to the art store soon and buy some new paint brushes. OH! i also have to go get my camera fixed, my new camera!!!! well, it's from '79 so it's not really "new" but it's new to me, my uncle just gave it to me about a mounth ago, i can't believe it broke! i feel really horrible about it. it's not my fault, i don't think it is at least, i was just taking a picture, as i regularly do, and when i pushed the button down it didn't come back up again. I started freaking out, fortunately babsy didn't get mad, i'm going to go to the camera stop on bryant on satruday and see she they think. in the meantime i'll use babsy nikon like i always have. to be honest, i like the nikon much better than my olympus, but oh well, i'm lucky to have what i've got.  Babsy was trying to be a good mother last night and talk with me. well, let me explain. I was in my room, on the computer as always, she came in and lied down on my bed, she does that a lot. i don't really remember what she came in to talk about, but i was looking online for a polariod printer, because i hate having to rent them. and i found one on ebay, 71 dollars, she says i can bid on it. it would be really aswome if i could have one, the new ones cost about 160, i don't really feel like paying that much, especially sicne the film for it is pretty expensive as well. I'll find out on wednesday (i think) if i get it or not.  today is too meloncholy, i have to go work in 30 minutes, i'm not really looking foward to that, but it's okay. right now i really feel like finding my tracy chapman cd, getting in my car, rolling the windows down and driving down highway 1 for a really really long time. and then camping somewhere for the night, with my telescope, i need to get back to nature, the city is crowding my thoughts. don't get me wrong, i love living in the city, i 'd never want to change that, but i need a break every now and then. maybe i need a break from people too. who knows. i've had too many strange thoughts lately to try and rationalize them quantatatively, so i'll stick to painting.

      when school ended at 11:30 i was found hurridly scurrying to the french room before anyone caught me. You see, i had to do my french oral final, something i had been specifically avoiding since tuesday, if i had run into any friends i would have blown the oral off, and gotten an F, so i was hurrying with my eyescast down, and hood up. the oral went surprisingly well, i got an A- on it? yeah, i was uber surprised, i forgot what i had planned to say, because i was too lazy to memorize the script, but i had a notecard in english which summerized everything that ihad to say. so i made it up on the spot, the only places i  messed up was i used the present tense for a few words, whoops. After i finished madame asked me to stay, there had been another girl making up her oral as well. so i stayed to talk to madame, i find it a wee bit ironic, on the last day of class while i was doing the other part of the oral final where she asks 5 random questions, i find out that she loves belle and sebastian as well, she was at the same show i went to, but up in the balcony. anyway. a week or so ago se saw me walking with some of my frends a few blocks away from school, i was smoking, she saw and i made my friends walk faster so we could get away. so she brought that up while talking to me, says i shouldn't get addicted. she's actually pretty nice when she's not yelling at me in french. she says i should see a movie called high fidelity, i forgot why she said i should see it, actually, i didn't understand why because she said it in french.   So i got out of the french room and met up with jamie, i had promised to go see harry potter with her. it was opening day, i always see these cult kind of movies on opening day, but normally it's with my friends from my old school. anyway, the movie was kick ass, although lupin looked different than i had expected, but all in all, it was good. they cut out a few scenes i wish they hadn't, but it was good.   the movie ended around 4, so i got on bart and went back to the city. i called casey when i got to civic center to see what she and lindsey were up to because we had all wanted to go hang out with some guys on mt. dave. they were at casey's house hanging out so i went there. casey was fighting with rye on the phone, so lindsey and i went outside for a smoke or two or three?? that soon got old so we went in and did some shots of vodka, then we went back upstairs to caseys room to get ready to go out. i washed my hair in caseys shower because it was greasy i guess. "alright, my hairs clean now, oh wait, nevermind" so lindsey did my hair and make-up, and i wore caseys clothes.  then dan and chris came and picked us up. then we bought some 40's and went to twin peaks, then to chris's house. i can't get into too many details, but there was a video camera.. not pretty sights. and yeah. i can't get into details for everyones safety. good fun, good fun.  I got home around 11:30 and crashed on my bed. i don't know how i mangaged to get out of my clothes, but somehow i did. i had a hell a bad headache, anda killar hangove in the morning.   OH! i had the craziest dreams last night. and i normaly don't have dreams. i woke up around 8:00 to let wendy into the house because no one else in my house ever answers the door. then i went back to sleep. the hours between going back to sleep and 10 were spent in a half dream state. i think the noises around me influenced my dreams a bit. but it was crazy. i'll describe.  I don't remember how it all began, but i was getting of a bus, a school bus but it wasn't for school. someone owned an old school bus, but had turned it into a kind of hippie bus. I was getting off and there was a huge field with some kind of carnival going on. I went to investigate, i found my cousin from L.A. she was getting her face painted. then i ran into lisa, she was wearing a dress. we wandered the place for a bit, then we ran into julia and mario. we went and did some kind of contest that involved fish. then i noticed that there was a church at the top of the hill. the field was on a hill.  so i walked up there on my own, there was a wedding going on inside, i saw ms. jefferys in there, i think it was her neice getting married. i was walking around one of the side aisles because it was very cramped inside although it was a huge church. i found my dad, he was just standing around there. i didn't fave me in the dream that he had ever been dead, is was just normal, like running into anyone. i stood in back with him for a little bit, then we went outside to get food. i had a boca burger, then i decided to start rolling down the hill. by this time most people from the carnival thing had gone inside the church to watch the wedding.   when i got to the botton of the hill i ran into ryan, the boy who i compete with at school. he bragging about how good he was at some tahitian dance involving moving sticks. so i walked away and started playing chess with mario, because there was a chess board there.   but it started to rain, so everyone who was still outside ran into the church, the wedding was over and the church was almost empty. for some reason the church had transformed into a theater, so i went on stage and started dancng and singing belle and sebastian songs. before long every who mattered was on stage with me dancing.  and then in the back of my head i head someone say, "yeah, i think she's hungover" which is when the dream went to a different scene.  i was back in san francisco, and i was running down some street, i think i was late, but as i was running i head stereolab in the background, chase music. i didn't understand why i was running so i stopped and turned around, and as soon as i did there was someone right there, with a gun pointed at me. i blinked once and they shot me in the chest. i continued to stare blankly at them, while moving my hand to the wound. instead of dying as i should have, i just turned back around and continued running.   this is where it got complicated, because i was no longer watching the dream as myself, it turned into a movie format, i was watching the person who had just shot me, i saw myself run away, the person who shot me turned to the person next ot him, he said "will she remember it when she get's older?" his female compainion responded " i wouldn't worry  about it, she knows where she's going now" but i didn't know where i was going.   the dream ended with me running into a bagel shop, i ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel with butter. i got my bagel, went out side to sit at a table with a stranger and lit up a cigarette. which is when i woke up.  it was very strange, i wish i knew what the dream meant, but it was very ironic when i went into the kitchen to see if i wanted breakfast and wendy said she bought some bagels. i looked in teh bag and there was a cinnamon raison bagel sitting on top. i guess some things will always be left unexplained.

       WARNING:  this entry contains extreamly boring geometry theorems. I can't believe i had to type these all up...   4-1 (Isosceles Triangle Theorem) if two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.  Corollary 1 an equilateral triangle is also equiangular  Corollary 2 an equilateral triangle has three 60 angles.  Corollary 3 the bisector of the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is perpendicular to the base at its midpoint.                                  4-2 if two angles of a triangle are congruent, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent.  Corollary An equiangular triangle is also equilateral.  4-3 (AAS Theorem) if two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.  4-4 (HL Theorem) if the hypotenuse and a leg of one right triangles are congruent to the corresponding part of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.  4-5 if a point lies on the perpendicular bisector of a bisector of a segment, then the point is equidistant for the endpoints of the segment.  4-6 if a point is equidistant from the endpoints of a segments, then the point lies on the perpendicular bisector of the angle.  4-7 if a point lies on the bisector of an angles, then the point is equidistant from the sides of the angle.  4-8 if a point is equidistant from the sides of an angle, then the point lies on the bisector if the angle.  5-1 Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent 5-2 Opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent 5-3 Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other 5-4 If both pairs of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are congruent, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram 5-5 If one pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral are both congruent and parallel, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. 5-6 If both pairs of opposite angles of a quadrilateral are congruent, them the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. 5-7 If the diagonals of a quadrilateral bisect each other, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram 5-8 If two lines are parallel, the all points on one line are equidistant for the other line. 5-9 If three parallel lines cut off congruent segments on one transversal, then they cut off congruent segments on every transversal. 5-10 A line that contains the midpoint of one side of a triangle and is parallel to another side passes through the midpoint of the third side. 5-11 The segment that joins the midpoints of two sides of a triangle (1) is parallel to the third side. (2) Is half as long as the third side. 5-12 the diagonals of a rectangle are congruent 5-13 he diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular 5-14 Each diagonal of a rhombus bisects two angles of the rhombus. 5-15 The midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equidistant from the three vertices. 5-16 Is an angle of a parallelogram is a right angle, then the parallelogram is a rectangle 5-17 If two consecutive sides of a parallelogram are congruent, then the parallelogram is a rhombus. 5-18 Base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent 5-19 The median of a trapezoid (1) is parallel to the trapezoid (2) has a length equal to the average of the lengths.  6-1 (the exterior Angle Inequality Theorem) the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is greater that the measure of either remote interior angle  6-2 if one side of a triangle is longer that the second side, then the angle opposite the first side is larger than the angle opposite the second side. 6-3 if one angle of a triangle is larger than a second angle, then the side opposite the first angle is longer than the side opposite the second angle. Corollary 1 the perpendicular segment from a point to a line is the shortest segment from the pinto the line Corollary 2 the perpendicular segment from a point to a plane is the shortest segment from the point to the plane 6-4 (the triangle inequality) the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. 6-5 (SAS Inequality Theorem) if two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the side of the second triangle. 6-6 (SSS Inequality Theorem) if two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, but the third side of the first triangle is longer that the third side of the second, then the included angle of the first triangle is larger than the included angle of the second.  7-1 (SAS Similarity Theorem) if an angle of one triangle is congruent to an angle of another triangle and the sides including those angles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar. 7-2 (SSS Similarity Theorem) if the sides of two triangles are in proportion, then the triangles are similar. 7-3 (triangle Proportionality theorem) if a lone parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. Corollary if three parallel lines intersect two transversals, then they devide the transversals proportionally 7-4 (Triangle Angle-Bisector Theorem) if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divided thw opposite side into segments proportional to the other two sides.  8-1 if the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then the two triangles formed are similar to the original triangle and to each other. Corollary 1 When the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, the length of the altitude is the geometric mean between the  segments of the hypotenuse. Corollary 2 when the altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, each leg is the geometric mean between the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse that is adjacent to that leg. 8-2 (Pythagorean Theorem) In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs. 8-3 if the square of one side of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is right triangle.  8-4 if the square of the longest side of a triangle is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is an acute triangle 8-5 if the square of the longest side of a triangle is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is an obtuse triangle. 8-6 (45-45-90 theorem) in a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is the square root of two times as long as the leg. 8-7 (30-60-90 Theorem) in a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice as long as the shorter leg, and the longer leg is the square root of three times as long as the shorter leg.  9-1 if a line is tangent to a circle, then the line is perpendicular to the radius drawn to the point of tangency.  Corollary  tangents to a circle from a point are congruent. 9-2 if a line I the plane of a circle is perpendicular to a radius at it’s outer endpoint, then the line is tangent to the circle. 9-3 in the same circle or in congruent circles, two minor arcs are congruent if and only if their central angles are congruent. 9-4 in the same circle of in congruent circles (1) congruent arcs have congruent chords. (2) congruent chords have congruent arcs. 9-5 a diameter that is perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord and its arc 9-6 in the same circle of in congruent circles, (1) chords equally distant from the center are congruent (2) congruent chords are equally distant from the center of the circle. 9-7 the measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent is equal to half he measure of the intercepted arc Corollary 1if two inscribed angles intercept the same arc, then the angles are congruent Corollary 2 an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle Corollary 3 if a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, then its opposite angles are supplementary 9-8 the measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 9-9 the measure of an angle formed by two cords that intersect a circle is equal to half the measures of the intercepted arcs 9-10the measure of an angle formed by two secants, two tangents,, or a secant and a tangent drawn from a point outside a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 9-11when two chords intersect inside a circle, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord. 9-12 when two secant segments are drawn to a circle from an external point, the product of one secant segment and its external segment equals the product of the other secant segment and its external segment 9-13 when a secant segment and a tangent segment are drawn to a circle from an external point, the product of the secant segment and its external segment is equal to the square of the tangent segment.

      i realize i've really got nothing much to say today. it's thursday, but you probably already know that. i'm taking journalism next year, at first is didn't want to because ms. hurley was the only teacher of it. but i was still going to because i  really  wantedto take journalism. today i found out my freshman english teacher, ms. phealan has taken over the newspaper and the journalism class. now it makes sense why she was asking me if i would be insterested in being an editor next year. it's going to be awsome. casey and lindsey are going to take it as well.  bello  after school today was fun, i got some nice good  clean  studying done. har har har. ouch. that hurt a bit. anyway, today seems a bit like a friday, although i've still got three more days of school left. blah major.   quiz question. leave the answer in my comment box. i want to hear EVERYONE'S repsonce, so that means you. *points* yes you. Q: how are paris hilton, anna nicole smith, julia styles, and angelia jolie connected?

      a monkey in a cage, it was the last time i was at the san francisco zoo. i was ten years old. i stood there staring with my big green ten year old eyes, i couldn't stop staring. but instead of staring at the monkey, i was staring at myself, i was the monkey, i was in cage. this was the first of many moments that followed were i felt like i was in a cage, that i danced when prodded, and did my best not to offend anyone so i could survive. i called it my "monkey theory" for a while. i was in a cage. am i still? sometimes i wonder, with all the restrictions in my life, the thin lines i like to hop back and forth on, am i still that ten year old gogling at a cage from within a cage. six years have gone, and a lot has changed, as it should change. but i still feel trapped, but only rarely, around "home" mostly. i feel like i have to cover up what i'm doing, like i have to hide myself. and sure, one could easily make paralells to my drinking and smoking habits and having to hide that. but that's not what i'm talking about. i feel like i need to control myself around here, like i have too stay quiet and appear normal. can't upset anyone, i'm relying on them for food, protection... just like a cage.  i painted my nails blood red out of boredom yesterday.

      today sucked for about an hour and a half, the rest was full of tuesday bliss. can you guess what hour and half i'm referring to? psycology time, i swere i'm never going back there. i forgot that i took my(casey's) sweatshirt off and kris noticed something i had wanted to keep hiden. he made me feal really REALLY REALLY uncomfortable. i wanted to scream and run out of the room. seriously, you don't get THAT close to me, i feel shitty again just thinking about it... i need a smoke.   anyway, the day got better, casey and i went to hang out on haight street. i spent 50's on cd's but i'm mostly happy. actually i've got to complain (sorry) okay, there is this band from scotland called camera obscura, a personal favorite, so i go in to buy a cd of theirs. who knew that there was also a band from san diego called camera obscura. well i do know. they're really obnoxious, i'm pissed that i wasted 7 dollars on the cd. but i did get some good ones. sondre lerche, le tigre, felt, and franz ferdinand.   hippie hill was the happening place today "can i look at with without being stoned?" i had to put that there, oh and the muffin man came to feed all the hippies muffins. i was tempted to get one, but i figured i'd rather save to food for the people who really need it. "everybody! it's 2 minutes to 4:20" someone screams across the hill. oh it was a beautiful day.  now i'm home with a headache trying to remember if i have any homework. i think the only thing i  have   to do is my french oral final poster. bleh, i don't feel like doing that.   love, allie

      babsy came in to tell me to go to sleep, it was 10:00, it's now 11:15 and she's asleep in my bed. i really wouldn't mind going to sleep right now, but my bed is occupied, i really hate it when she does this. she claims my bed is more comfortable. now i have to put up with hearing her snore. mleh. i still haven't done anything for my french oral final tomorrow, it's not until after lunch, but i'm worried. i really wish it wasn't a partner kind of thing, then i could do it all on my own. but we need to make some sort of a diolog about which french  colony we want to visit on our vacation, how we'd get there, what we'd do if something went wrong. where we would stay, what we would do in our free time. what the place is like, what the food is like, talk about what we like there. i think we may need pictures as well. fuck. i really wish this was a solo project. i could do this on my own, but jenny is a dolt and she's going to fuck it up doing improv. fuck fuck fuck. i guess i'll chose a country tonight and print out pictures and information on it. then we'll take it from there. fuck. i really can't fail french. i need to get a C, i really really do.  in other news... i ended up going to the barbeque for a bit, i needed a brain break and decided to be social. all of our pretencious neighborhood group was there, jackie was just back from costa rica from his green peace services, i forgot their names once again, but the couple that owns  urlLink the center for the book  was there, we were discussing pin hole photography, it was good. let's see, who else was there, of course jeremy and some of our friends were there. i casually ate my veggie buger and snuck a few maragritas because no one cared. margi was telling me about a big block party that was going to take place over the summer that she was trying to plan. it sounds like fun, she wants us kids to play music, meaning i have to talk to jeremy, he plays drums, i play guitar, trevor plays bass and we'll probably get nick to play guitar as well, and mike to sing, although i think they're tying to con me into vocals. bleh, not something i want. but the block party sounds fun, so there will be music, and then food, vegeterian of course, and then margi mentioned a few garage sale kinds of things, oh! and art shows. she wants to sell some of her art and she said i could sell some of mine if i wanted to as well. this summer is starting to sound better and better. then i was talking to nacy (jeremy's mom)for a while, she was telling me about CSSSA because summer, who's still in dublin, went there about 4 years ago. Summer had a hell of atime, she went for acting, she's studying abroud in dublin right now, i think she's coming back in two weeks.   eventually i left and went back to studying, i really enjoyed my stay over there though, i need to start spending more time with the local group. eveyrone is so wonderful, and the adults don't treat us like kids, which is always a plus. it's like one big family.

      i feel horrible about this, although it really doesn't matter, i have two plants in my room. two cacti (the plural of cactus?) and i haven't watered them in over a month. i know that i'm not supposed to water them very often, but the person i bought them off of said every two weeks. it's been way more than that. it probably doesn't even make a difference being a dessert plant and all, i just feel bad.  my head is hurting from studying, i just took some tylonol but it hasn't kicked in yet. i took it two minutes ago so i don't know why i expect it to have started working yet. i'm supposed to be at a dinner party at jeremy's right now. a barbeque for memorial day i guess. i had too much work to do so i'm sitting here in my room listening to the gentle waves on repeat and taking notes on brave new world. very dull.  i might take a walk in a bit, and everything that entails. i'm kind of sick of my room right now, i've been in here almost all day studying and doing homework, deep down i'm very ahsamed that i haven't made it out today.   i guess we're lucky that they like san francisco a whole lot.

       “Without having variety to choose from an individual will only believe in what they believe in because they are ignorant to all the other options in the world, therefore they don’t truly believe in what they think they believe in because they don’t know any other ways of life.”    There is a slight possibility that I’m having too much fun with my biology essay on evolution. Just a slight slight possibility….   I just made a bottle rocket for my brother, it’s his science homework for the past two weeks to construct one, and it’s due tomorrow. Of course he never did it, and since I remembered how to make one from when I was in seventh grade, I’m making the entire thing for him while he writes his essay on Russian classical music, or maybe just about Russian. I this it’s hilarious how I’m doing his homework for him when I should be studying for my finals. At least I got the essay done, which is a relief. But now I’ve got my hands covered in black spray paint since the wind cant make up it’s mind which direction to blow, and enough paint chemicals in my lungs to make me light headed. Okay, distraction time is over. Next on my list of things to do is take notes on brave new world, so I’m off.  Listening: camera obscura

      I'm kind of placid today. Not really with it, and not really sure what it is that I should be with. I've been contemplating doing my homework and studying for finals since they begin on Friday. But so far all I’ve managed to do is take the stack of papers out of my bag and put them into piles according to class and importance to the finals. I have to write a persuasive essay on why evolution should be taught in schools. I’ve got my main points, but every time I sit down to write it out in 5 paragraph essay form I lose interest and start doing something else. I’m not being lazy exactly, I’m just doing as little as possible to still consider myself working. I’ve got all day tomorrow to work as well. I think if I finish my essay today, and maybe study a bit for Biology and History of Christian Art, I’ll be good. This was I’ll have all tomorrow to prepare for my French oral since my partner is even worse than I at French, and doesn’t really care that she’s going to fail the final. All I need in the class is a C, and right now I’m not even sure if I’ll get that. I don’t understand what happened, I had an A all last semester, and now I’m trying to raise my D to a C. this fucking sucks. The only other class I’m worried about is English, I don’t know what’s happening in that class, I’ve been getting 100%’s on all the tests, but I had that really cruel and unfair C+ last quarter because of the catcher in the rye essay fiasco (yes, I’m now calling it a fiasco) I just don’t know.  I used to do so well in school, now I just don’t care about it very much. I think it’s because my classes were so boring this year. I feel partially ashamed to say my favorite classes were pre-cal and biology. Well, English got good the last semester since I switched classes, but that was largely because Casey and Lindsey are in English with me. I assume next year will be better, The classes I’m taking are all pretty much classes I would choose to take, English, Psychology, Sociology, U.S. History Honors, Chemistry Honors, Journalism, and AP Calculus. Ethics is the only one that I’d rather not take, but I figure if I get good people in the class it will be fun. Enough of my rambling about school.  Eugh, today’s one of those days where everything is crap, well not exactly, but I feel like calling it crap. I’m not really tired but my body feels abused, I woke up with more bruises on my legs again, I honestly don’t know how they got there, I honestly don’t know why I’m writing that here. I’ve been thinking a lot today, about all sorts of things. Firstly, CSSSA, it’s been suggested to me by too many people that I’m going to come back from L.A. a full on druggie shooting up heroin in my spare time, having sex all the time with anyone, and what was the other thing… shit I can’t remember, something about an attitude of sorts, I’ll have to consult my AIM logs later when I’ve got my laptop on. It’s those suggestions that scare me because I really can see myself doing all that stuff there, and coming back completely changed. There have been a lot of interesting conversation about my behavior lately, mostly with Andy in Connecticut, I’m pissed I wont get to see her this summer at the chore :( oh well. I think it was best started that I’m let go of my limitations of mind. Here, this is what I mean (I’d straight copy if from the log but I don’t like revealing screen names): “you’ve stopped caring what other people are going to think about you, stopped acting so to speak, I’m sure you know what I mean. You’ve just become who you were always too scared to be, yourself.” Let’s see, she goes on… “You know, this probably explains why you’ve stopped being so depressed. Suppressing yourself makes you depressed. So now I guess you don’t have so many problems because everything is true.” My response “I guess, no you’re right, there are no more ‘what if’s’, because I dunno, I’ve let go of expectations?” well,  that’s all of that I’ll put here. But I think it’s really true. I’ve spent enough time avoiding who I am, and late at night have always wondered what would happen if I was just me, or who the real me was, because for a very long time I never knew. So I tried on different personas in different settings. I always felt really uncomfortable, itchy skin. I would just go around avoiding what I really wanted to say, and what I really wanted to do. A lot of recent conversations have helped me out a lot lately. I wasn’t even aware of the transition to this, to being comfortable with myself, but I think it was helped a lot by talking with friends. So with CSSSA, whatever happens happens, Sean is going to be down there as well, I’m not really sure how that will be, I’m actually a little apprehensive about how things will be down there in L.A. Who knows, I always have trouble deciphering my thoughts and feelings, so maybe this is all imagined anyway. I’m feeling a lot better about CSSSA then I had been, but I’m still a little nervous, an excited nervous. There’s not an inch of me that doesn’t want to go, but with everyone’s suggestions of how I’m going to change down there, what kinds of situations I’ll get into, I just don’t know what to expect. The scary truth is I can see myself becoming the indie druggy that everyone keeps suggesting that I’ve almost already become, I can see myself doing just about everything that has I’ve been told will happen. I’m not so sure I want some of the things to happen. Maybe it’s just my limitations that still haven’t been broken all the way?  Another thing that I’ve been thinking about a lot lately is relationships. I think I wrote briefly about this on Thursday. I’ve always thought subconsciously that I’ve needed someone. But in truth, I’m really good by myself, I’ve always been good at being alone, and have chosen to stay that way most of my life. It’s only when I get really depressed do I really start believing that I really do need someone else. I don’t know where this thought is going. For a long time, the exact start time is a little fuzzy, but probably since 7th or 8th grade, I was pretty convinced I was bi. It’s something I think less about now, but I’ve kind of shifted away from it, as I’ve shifted away from relationships. It’s not something I deny, just not something I put into action often. We’ve all had our drunken moments, some things I did during those intoxicated moments fueled my mind, but really, they were nothing more than drunken moments. Now I really don’t know where this thought is going, it probably would have been better never to write any of this out on the internet. But what I’m trying to say, I think, is that although I don’t really consider myself to be bi any longer, it’s not something I’ve turned down definitely. I’ve never really been a person to pursue relationships anyway, so none of this really matters.    I think I’ve allotted myself too much time to write this all out, to let my mind wander in the form of written words. Sometimes I wonder what I’d to if I didn’t always write these lengthy entries when something was bothering me, or I just needed to empty my mind in order to focus. This has always been a good place for me to get away mentally, I just hope I can keep it up, I’ve been very… unwell lately. Physically unwell I mean. Mentally I’m pretty good, I’m happy with who I am and that cup of tea, but in the meantime I haven’t been sleeping very well at all, I’m pretty sure the insomnia has gotten worse, I did sleep on Wednesday, but that’s about it. I’ve been having to take caffeine pills to keep myself awake during the day, and lots of pain killers to get rid of my plaguing headaches. Today especially I think my body is feeling the wear and tear from all this. I just feel energy less, which is kind of normal, but I can’t find the word I want to use to describe this feeling. I feel limp, and very disconnected from myself. I really fancy a nap right about now, but I’ve still got to write that evolution essay. Sigh, everything always happens at once doesn’t it?

      Well, i thought instead of explaining what happened saturday, i'd havea storytelling in picture format. I haven't posted pictures here in awhile so i thought it seemed rather fitting since i've got about 200 pictures from yesterday, my camera has become quite the slut (i originally called it a whore, but then seabass corrected me because whores get paid, and my camera was most definately not getting paid)so without further ado: saturday in technicolour.    ask questions, be scared, stay away from produce.   yes, i will get you back for pouring glitter on me...   bow down and pray   lisa's counting wall       some how the fruit is always the first to go.       mark's cake!!!         getting your dollars worth at a bowling ally

      summertime... i exploded at babsy this morning, i was feeling slow and tired and was sitting in bed reading very peacefully when she comes in and asks me to take care of the recycling downstairs. that's my job in this fake family unit, the recycling. anyway, it doesn't need to go out until monday morning when they come collect it, so i told her i'd do it in a bit. she came in a half hour later and was going on and on about how lazy i am, i screamed at her and went off to do it. i then proceeded to leavethe house to "get my summer reading books" i ended up buying one of them, the other was out of stock or something. but i went to yurba buena garderns because they have the international music festival there all this week, i sat for a while and wrote some notes i'd been meaning to finish. i smoked a bit to calm my raging temper. whne that didn't work i went to buy a cd, and had a lovely conversation with the cahs register girl about camera obscura (that was what i was buying) and belle and sebastian. then i came home and continued reading.  now, let's see, i'm just sitting around, i was watching high fidelity for a while, good flim, i really should start watching movies more often, i havea huge list of things i want to see, oh well. it's looking pretty sunny outside, i think i may go take a nap in my backyard, or maybe get in the hot tub for a bit. oh, i cleaned it out and filled it up after almost a year of not using it, everyone should come over soon, i'll have a party.

      i've noticed that i haven't been writting here as often as before, i've been pretty busy i guess, well, summer has been pretty overwhelming so far. i'm still having some trouble grappaling the idea that it's really summer, what a dream... sigh.  yesterday was really good, i slept in late, picked up my pictures on church st, went to lisa's to bake pies, went to balazo on 24th and mission to see hansell. i met the SI freshman, they're pretty cool, we went on an alcohol run, which was succesful. i danced a bunch inside, then there was a bunch of us all sitting in the hallway being a "fire hazard" it was one of the nicest moments of the evening, everyone just sitting there talking, weven if joe was molesting tiffany. then i was standing around outside for awhile smoking, or as lisa puts it, beinga bad indie kid. *shrugs* oh well. i was telling mario and lisa and bland about this go-cart racing place down in palm springs, i think we're all going to try and go down there. it would be fun. i haven't raced go-carts in about... *silent sigh* a year and a half ago. my dad and i used to race go-carts all the time, i really enjoyed that. then, i think we went to the beach and set of some fireworks, only i really fucked one up and it shot at me instead of the sky. one word of advice, don't hand explosives to drunks. but we didn't stay at the beach very long, i ended up sleeping over at julia's house which was nice, i don't think i had done that since... october perhaps. yeah, i think so.  today was been rather meloncholy, but in a good way. i rented high fidelity as madame bernard suggested, "it's the new belle and sebastian song", it's all so ironic when i think about it. anyway, i took a nice long walk with my sketch book to smoke. thats the one thing i don't like, maxy has no life, which is okay, but he never leaves the house and i miss not having the house to myself anymore. but i guess i'm out most of the time anyway, so it doesn't really matter.  Now i'm listening to the smiths and searching for my age of empires cd, maybe maxy borrowed it, i should look into that. anyway, i'm off. later days.

       Holland, 1945   The only girl I've ever loved Was born with roses in her eyes But then they buried her alive  One evening 1945 With just her sister at her side  And only weeks before the guns  All came and rained on everyone  Now she's a little boy in Spain  Playing pianos filled with flames On empty rings around the sun All sing to say my dream has come  But now we must pick up every piece Of the life we used to love  Just to keep ourselves At least enough to carry on  And now we ride the circus wheel With your dark brother wrapped in white Says it was good to be alive But now he rides a comet's flame  And won't be coming back again The Earth looks better from a star That's right above from where you are  He didn't mean to make you cry  With sparks that ring and bullets fly  On empty rings around your heart The world just screams and falls apart   But now we must pick up every piece Of the life we used to love Just to keep ourselves At least enough to carry on  And here's where your mother sleeps And here is the room where your brothers were born Indentions in the sheets  Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore And it's so sad to see the world agree  That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

      well, i feel a twinge of sorrow for not writting here for a while, this happens sometimes, especially when a lot's going on. So perhaps a storytelling should be incorperated into this dear little entry. The last I wrote was on sunday, let's see what i've been doing, because these things are hard for even me to remember.  Monday was finals, and the day ended at 11:30. instead of going home and studying as a good student would have, i went to haight st. and the park with chris and casey. it ws kind of a good bye day for chris since he's not coming back next year, and is moving in a week or so. i admit i was a little paranoid, when we walk under the bridge to go to hippie hill i saw my brothers entire 7th grade class, they were having a picnic or something. but max and mateo came up and i had to use my swift decision making skills and toss my cigarette in the bushes. bah. anyway, it all turned out good so i don't know why i complain. Then we left around 3:30 i went to drop my film of at colorworks because i need some kind of example art work to bring down to csssa. which was my day.  Tuesday, which was yesterday i guess, was the last day of school. we got out at 11:30 again. i had to go through the hellish process of selling back my books. erg. then around 12:30ish brian and i left to meet lisa, seabass, and casey in japantown. the 5 of us left almost as soon as we got there, we went to seabass' house to drop of brians  backpack. then lindsey came and we all got on the 31 without a plan. (what, are you new?) we ended up getting off at arguello because there is a store that sells to underage there. so we bought three 40's and two half pints of rum. we walked up to the park and found a rather nice log to perch ourselves upon. i downed my 1/2 pint pretty quickly, i guess i've got a pretty high tolerance. then we walked in the park for awhile, stoppingat many benches of for smoke breaks, it was just like a movie...    then we got on the bus again and went to stutro park and observed the ocean. it was rather nice up there.    then we left to go to julia's house around 6:00. seabass left to go to an interview and lindsey had to go home, so julia, mario, casey, lisa, brian, and i went to the canvas on lincoln and 9th. well, lisa came there with us, but she had to go home when we got there, she had some nice arts and crafts. brian and i got burritos, then we all lounged aroundt he canvas. soon sh sea, frankie, mike and si sean came to join the party. there was a free comedy night there so we all sat around listening to them. some of them were pretty bad. we convinced both mike and seabass to get upthere and do comedy. everyone left the canvas around 10:00 so i took the bus home with brian and seabass. i realy love taking the bus at night. there was one point while i was taking the 22, i was the only one on the bus, it was nice, very very nice. anyway. i got home at 11:04, 4 minutes after cerfew, not that it matters. i talked to julia for an hour of so on the phone, i felt bad because i was in a rather volatile state because i had a headache and was dead tired. sorry.   Today i don't know exactly what i'm doing yet. there was some mention of a barbeque with taylor, but i don't know if thats still happening. i should probably pick up the phone and call some people. that is all.

      It’s been a while dear journal. That feels rather informal, calling you a journal and all. Let’s start over.  Hello, it’s been a while. Okay, I can’t exactly remember the last time I wrote here, or wrote a lengthy entry, as I know this one is bound to be.  Things have been rather topsy-turvy lately, it’s summer, that’s one thing I guess. I’ve been enjoying the freedoms of having no schedule or much of any obligations. Most, if not all my actions have been very spur of the moment since I first got out of school last Tuesday. Even Tuesday wasn’t planned, but I really like how everything just falls together in the most intricately perfect ways. I’ve been keeping rather busy, going out just about every day and night, but I still feel like I’ve been home enough to relax. The consistency of this summer is marvelous.   Yesterday was really nice, I woke up at 12:30 after going to sleep 5 hours prior. I didn’t plan on going out all day, I figured it would be nice to just unwind and watch TV all day, I had the house to myself for the first time all vacation. But then Casey called me around 2 I think, she wanted to know if I wanted to hang out for a bit, she was on the boat coming back from Mill Valley. So I met her around 3, I was of course late, but I had some errands to run before hand. We both wanted to go to the beach, but we were hungry so we thought we’d stop in and get some food on van ness before we got on the 5. While we were eating Lindsay called to see what we were doing, since she didn’t live to far away we went and met her at her house then proceeded to the beach. We got there around 5:30; we thought we’d stay there for an hour and then head to ours homes respectively.  Lindsay and I went swimming, I actually went swimming, meaning all the way under the water. It was warm so we lounged around for a bit. Then Julia called, she reminded me that there was something happening at the canvas at 8:00, I had known about it but had completely forgotten. So I gave old Babsy a call to ask her if I could stay out later and go see it, and if Casey and Lindsay could sleep over. Both plans were a go. So we acted upon both plans. Sean and Mike had made a video for the “Open Shorts” which is like and open mike for film shorts. It was good, I only saw three of the films because I had to leave at 9:30, or something equally ridiculous. We stopped for a burrito on the way home and arrived at 10:30, maybe 11:00, I don’t really know. We made pizza and went to my back house and just lived for a while. We were smoking in there as well and the room was getting hella hazy and smoking inside so we had t open a window and let the cold cold night air in. We watched a lot of TV, had some fun games going on and around 4:30 we got hungry again so we crept inside and got some cereal and milk and other good breakfast foods.  Casey fell asleep around 5:00; Lindsay and I stay up until 5:30 to watch the sun rise. It was good. We all woke up around 12:30 and just lounged around my backyard. We filled up my hot tub at one point which was really nice. Lindsay left around 5ish to go to Marin and Casey stayed until 9ish when her dad picked her up. We had some good good times.  I was hella paranoid because I thought Babsy had seen us smoking in the backyard when she came home during her lunch break and caught me off guard. I honestly don’t know if she saw or not, but she acted hella normal, and hasn’t really said anything about it. But maybe she did see and just doesn’t really care. I was talking with her about getting my license an hour or so ago and she said I couldn’t get it because the insurance was going to triple, and she didn’t want to pay that much, I understand. As much as I want to drive I can understand that she doesn’t want to pay that much for me. Anyway, I mentioned that I wanted to get a California ID card because I’ll be 17 soon.  Babsy: “what? So you can get into bars?” Me: “no, you have to be 21 to get in, the drinking age is 21 mom”  Babsy: “you should have grown up in new york” she says with a large smile on her face.  I don’t think she knows that you have to be 18 to buy cigarettes, or anything like that. I really don’t know. Sometimes there are some advantages to having an ex-hippie as your mother. I remember a few weeks ago Babsy kept talking to me one night when I came home completely smashed (she didn’t know that I was drunk though) she was telling me how she and her friends would drive over the border into new york every Friday so they could buy alcohol (she lived in new jersey and about 20 minutes away from new york city) and have parties. I keep telling her that the drinking age is 21 in Cali, she always forgets. One of my favorite times telling her that was her response “that sucks, I’m sorry. Back when I was your age anyone could buy alcohol if they looked over 16” I was fuming inside. WHY COULD IT STILL BE LIKE THAT?????  Onwards. Monday was really nice too now that I think about it. Very very random, but beautiful all the same. Lisa called me up to go to “lunch” and to buy inky pens. Somehow we got carried away and plans changed. We ended up meeting up with Brian and Seabass and drinking, then Brian, Seabass and I went to the balibreara residence were we met up with the four SI freshmen. So we all went a walking and ended up singing bohemian rhapsody on the bus and playing elevator tag in the Marriott. I got home smelling of booze and cigarettes at 11:00, so I took a shower, the first in over a week. It was good unplanned fun.  What else? Oh, my summer search thing, they want to kick me out of the program because I’m “showing disinterest”, whatever. I’ll probably be able to stay, I just have to BS it up a whole lot on the phone. Babsy would kill me if I got kicked out of the program. I’ll have to be more careful from now on.   I’m lying in bed right now watching the Belle and Sebastian DVD again. It never gets old. Okay, that’s all, I promise.

      i think we need some tacos in here. TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  um.... yeah! *grins evilishly* (evilishly? is that a word?) a whisp of smoke just passed in front my computer screen, it scared me a bit (it just did it again) but then i remembered i'm burning insense and my room isn't on fire. whoopie!   i don't really have much to say here, loni and wendy are coming to visit on wednesday, i think they're staying until... friday, maybe saturday. thursday i have to go to the dentist, then i'm going to a show at bottom of the hill, a friends band is playing there so i feel obligated to come and support. wednesday i might go up to mt. dave, well, i want to at least, casey..... (i don't think she's listening)   well, i'm sitting in bed, using my laptop listening to crappy late night tv, watching whisps of inscence blow by. ohhhhh kay. it's an ice machine!

      I actually have nothing to say. i've been awake since 5:30 AM friday morning, it is now 3:32 AM on saturday. You might think I would be insanely craving sleep right now, as it's been... 22 hours, but nononono, insomnia strikes again (big mouth strikes again). i don't really mind though, except that my battery is running out and i'm overheating in bed, life is pretty good right now. i'm looking foward to a nice morning of listening to sigur ros and reading the pile of books next to my bed.   in other news, i saw farenhieght 9/11 today, mindnight showwing, very good. the movie was very long, 2 and a half hours long, and some of the images were very blury, but it was good. i don't find it the least bit ironic how they are releasing this movie only 4 months before the presidential election... good work democrats, good work.   anyway... i'm off in another world at the moment, a swirly mood where all i want to do is write nonsense, so i'll close this window before i can't contain the rein (of fire, hahahahaha)  oh, banana party.

      there's an art to clicking on this computer. at least online there is, so i've learned. it's a hold down and a flick of the  finger while kepping the other fingers off the track pad. and if you don't do that correctly you'll get a nice message from the computer automator, "this page failed to load" buut really the clicking is just off.   i'm listening to my modest mouse cd. float on just came on, so did the tears, the song is uncannily depressing. float on, sometimes i really feel like thats what i'm doing. for the first time in my life i really feel at place with who i am, like i'm not wearing a mask anymore. but somedays i just feel like i'm floating through the day, everything means nothing, i'm just watching a show. it's that trivial nonsense that keeps me up, i go out to be out, to get away from my house. but it all could mean nothing, i feel like i'm living just to take up time.  i see no future in  which i fit, it depresses me sometimes. i can barely see past this year, not even, i c an't really see past the summer, it could be the smoke distorting my view, but i think it's the chemicals in my brain, i have no dreams of a future, no hopes of family, jobs, anything. i see myself floating on just to be alive, to be here, to float. i'm sure i'll end up achieving some kind of future, i just don't know how it will happen, where i'll end up. i'll just float through my days wondering, wandering. a belle and sebastian song come to ming "my wandering days are over" i recomend everyone goes out and listens to it. in some senses my wandering days are over because i'v'e become the person i am, mentally i'm happy with who i am as fore mentioned. but in other sense i'm still very much wandering.   and with a long smoke filled sigh i stop thinking about the future. it will happen, it always does. sometimes i wish i had more ambition, or a passion that i could rely on for strength. i've got interests, sure. this summer at art school will be great, i've no doubts in that, but sometimes that are just so many things i want to do, and my summer fo next year is already planned out, wilderness camp for 6 weeks. backpacking, yeah, i like that kind of thing, but i don't like such certain plans, unchangable fates.   I want to take a semester off from SH next year and go to this artist colony school in Napa, the Oxbow School. you go there for a semester and study art as long as some academics. i honestly think that would be a better community for me. i would be away from my family which brings me sanity and a sense of self. i would be with amazing people and be doing something i love. babsy said i might be able to go there SH willing and if i get finacial aid. it cost 15,000 for a semester. i really feel like i need to get away from this enviroment, away from this house.  I've discussed graduating early with babsy a few times. a semester early, i don't think a full year is realistic. babsy would let me do it, we're just not sure if Sh would. I'd be willing to go to summer school, take night classes, i'd do whatever it takes to get out early. and what would i do with one less semester of school? i don't really know, evveryone esle would be in school, maybe i'd go on a roadtrip by myself, or work, working sounds good. i just feel like i've outgrown SH, i have since i got there, and i'm not meaning to sound pretencious, or concieted, it's just the community, i love alot of people there, but the general attidute of the people there just isn't my cup of tea.   as i said, i just don't know where my life is going. i'm going to be an editor on the school newspaper next year, i'm excited about that in my normal, non-expressive way. ms. phelan  has taken over the paper since evil ms. hurley got fired (thank god) i'm going to take journalism with her next year, i don't really care that it entails getting to school at 7:00 since i pretty much already did that. i like ms. phelan, sure, she's not the best teacher in the world, but a lot of the problem was that the students in the class just didn't care. she's agreat person though, she really cares about what she's teaching, and the students. she was really excited about csssa when i was telling her how i was going to go there, she had been berreting all her juniors to apply there, but failed miserably to interest any of them. i've been meaning to pop into SH to talk to her some day, i tried to when i was picking up lindsay with casey, but she was teaching, and then on the phone.  i'm in a writting mood tonight, i've been writting a story/book/whatever for the past 6 months, its about a bunch of high school kids. indie kids as many would classify them. i don't know if it's any good, but it keep me interested, keeps me thinking, gives me something to do.   i just looked at the clock on my computer screen, it says 2:39, i promised lisa that i would go to sleep early, and early for me means sometime before 4:30, my normal pass out time. i think, given the option, i would be nocturnal. the night is so much easier to deal with, well, there are just less people to deal with, which makes everything so much easier. it's all i do when i'm home, stay up all night, then sleep in all day and leave within an hour of being awake   "the good times are killing me"   -modest mouse quote  perhaps one more cigarette and i'll get under the covers and fall asleep to the flashing colours on the tv screen. late night cartoons are my favorite, it's actually the only time i do watch tv. tv is poison, i stand by that.  so goodnight sweet dreams and all that merryment love from, allyson

      actually, i haven't got much to say.   i really need to pop out for a smoke right now, babsy keeps yelling at me, and i am now reminded why i chose to spend as much time out of the house as possible the basst two weeks. remind me if i ever get urges to stay home, that i shouldn't. under no circumstance should i be allowed to spen a full day at home, or even half a day. this is death.  lisa, casey, and julia came over in the afternoon today. we baked all things banana. it was good. i wanted to go to the canvas with julia, but babsy said i had to stay home "you've been out everynight, i want you to stay here tonight" bleh, i really hate being here. and i still really need a cigarette.  i'm going to go see if i can sleep outside tonight. that would really help the situation a lot.

      a long long tuesday  3:15 AM  go to sleep. finally  6:00 AM  woken up by mother who makes me drive her to the car garage to pick up her car.   6:30 go back to sleep... only i couldn't fall alseep so it was much more like lying in bed with my eyes closed dreaming up stories and tossing and turning while trying not to lay on my sun burns.  9:30 AM  get out of bed and "get ready" to go out which involved locating my bag, getting dressed, and brushing my teeth.  10:00 AM  sitting at bus stop smoking wondering where the hell the bus is  10:50 AM  get to school find casey, find bland, go to beach.  1:00 PM  back at school, find some food to eat and pick up lindsay.  okay... that's not working anymore, well, i don't like scedules very much. casey, lindsay, and i went and hung out at lindsays for a while then we decided to go see napolean dynamite at 4:20. the movie was good, i'd recomend it, but it was strange. afterwards i we went to go smoke in some park courtyard where all i could think about was a nice hot cup of coffe which i eventually got on my way home.   I was home at 7:00 today, that was a first in a very long time. babsy and max had something to eat, they failed to mention they were eating dinner to me so when i walked in the kitchen around 9 to see what was going on babsy told me that if i was hungery i'd just have to feed myself, which i'm used to by now. i don't know, i feel like i'm not really a part of my family anymore.  there is a buelah show on saturday at the fillmore, i think i'm going to go see them. well, i'd like to go see them it's mostly a matter of how much the tickets are and if i can find anyone who wants to go see them.   I've been listening to sondre lerche all day, it's been fitting. i can't expand on that subject but i think i'm off to the kitchen to go make myself some dinner.  love, allie

      i haven't actually got too much to say, i was talking to an old friend for awhile, i think i may go to the  Fashion Co-Op  with her, it should be fun. i'm listening to seymour stein right now, by chance actually. but i watched little shop of horrors with lisa earlier today, one of the main people is called seymour, so i made us listen to seymour stein after the movie was over.   i went to my appointment at summer search, it was a grueling and painful hour long talk. i was starting to get rather fed up, really fed up actually. i hate BSing that much, but at least i'm still in the program. i'd rather BS it and stay in, then be honest and have to deal with babsy's wrath about being kicked out. all in all it went well i guess...  well... what else, lisa and i are doing lot's of banana baking. enough said.

      well, i'm back from the delta. it waws boatfulls of fun (har har) i learned how to waterski, which is awsomely fun, even if the water was grossish.   i don't really feel like writting anything actually. maybe it's just the squirrels? i'm getting really distracted. i took a nice bath, i just lied in the warm water reading for a while. forgot to do any washing *shurgs* oh well.   yeah... the new belle and sebastian ep comes out tomorrow, i want to go buy it, i'll have to go to the bank sometime soon. i need clothing as well, pants, and skirts. that's the top of my to do list.   which is where i'll say goodnight.

      hey kids, this very well may be my last post here for the week. in about six hours i will be waking up and hauling a whole lot of camping gear into the car and then driving my mom and brother up to family camp. it's not even that i get a choice to drive, babsy hates driving on the freeways so i'm really the only one who can drive. yipee! anyway, i should be piss tired and craving a smoke the  whole time, but i'll manage one way or another.  camp will be... fun? maybe, maybe not. i have a feeling i'll be taking lots of long walks into town to look at the lake and get away from everyone. i don't even want to imagine the hell once i run out of cigarettes, thats one thing i forgot to do, i guess thats good since i am trying to quit. it's my goal for the end of the summer, let's see how i will do?   now it's about 12:30 and i'm sitting in bed with a laptop, i should as they say "hit the hay" but i'm not feeling very tired, not very tired at all. hm. i guess this is good bye until i get to L.A.   hugs and kisses, allie

      is it so sad that i'm in love with my new alarm clock? yes, i think it it. but then again, having said alarm clock is a bit of a novilty. see, i've never had one before, sure, i've had my stereo which i could program to turn on at a certain time, but nothing like this. this little alarm clock glows red number right next to my bed, it goes off at exactly 8:30 AM pacific standard time and when i sleepily hit the snooze button (SNOOZE BUTTON!!!!) the constant beeping will subside for exactly 9 minutes. it's a novilty... let me enjoy it.  another new addiction to my collection of electronics is my cell phone. as many may know i broke my cell phone... on purpose. anyway, after two blissfull weeks of not havinga phone i finally got a new one today, a new number too. (415-533-4794 for those who care) anyway, it's a colour flip phone and i've been obsessing over it for the past few hours. it's got many lovely options on it, i can go online.... and have many wonderful ring tones... and COLOUR!!! and best of all, it flips. IT FLIPS!!!! okay, rant over.  i saw spider man 2 today with casey and maxy, it was pretty good, better than the first one, but thats not saying too much (i didn't really like the first one) but it was fun. i spent the day in a skirt once again, i'm waging war on the wind... yeah, i hate the wind.   what else... ... .... ..  .. .. ...  .   ..  .... ..  ... okay, i can't think of anything else to write. i'm not really tired but tomorrow (friday) should bea long day. i have to pack a whole lot and lisa might come over (hopefully with whip-its?)   GOODNIGHT

      to keep writting here... i feel very dry of words today. no, i've got a lot to say, this just seems the wrong enviroment for my speach. actually, this is bullshit.  i'm sitting in my darkened room listening to jefferson airplane, it's like last summer, except not at all. this summer has been so much better; will be so much better. last year... well, i was sad in my own way, i wasn't letting anyone in, but then again, no one was really trying to hard. i was a closed case, story finished. i didn't want anyone to see me weak, i wasn't able to be weak, i had to be the strong one, i am by nature. so i was there for all those around me, i felt overwelmed so i drank when i got the chance, oh and how i drank when i did. but i wouldn't let anyone see how i was crumbling, i couldn't. recently i've been asked why my voice sounds like a monotone sometimes. i hadn't wanted to answer the question, the questions were, as it were, driving the monotone. when i get cornered, orput in akward positions, it's my defense to lose emotion, to just remove any of my feelings from the situation, it helps me in a way deal with everything that i need to take care of. and in essance, that was my summer. i forgot who i was because i wasn't important anymore, i had to take care of other things, and other people. i had to be the strong one. it helped others to not see the tears, for if they had... well, it would have been worse, it would have been bad. and that was the essance of my summer last year. occasionally i got out of my house, but then it was only to  escape to to friends who didn't really care, and didn't really see. but i went along with them anyway, i drank to forget it all, and once i really did forget it all. a fatefull night. but that's not really what this is about. it's about... well, who knows.  last summer i listened to white rabbit on repeat for about 3 hours while i composed a poem about time. perhaps i will post it now.   A TIMELESS PEACE these days are just packed nothing in particular, never predictable it's always sunny when everything is amusing and you're never bored when the world is full of possibilities just take the dive  time rolls on, speeds up, and floats away try and catch a moment and you'll be stuck there forever waves crash, clouds pass time drifts by  spend a day in the ocean wake up the next morning you can still feel the gentle rocking life takes you by surprise and what you never expected, it's just around the corner  seasons come and go when you take the time to appreciate whats in front of you it's always there time drifts by  when you think you're stuck in a rut don't get caught in the past you only have enough time to live in the present and if you're in the past how will you ever reach the future live for the time   a few people have seen this poem before, and most of the time i'm normally asked what i wrote i about, a lot of people jump to the conclusion that i wrote it about what happened to my dad. well i didn't. i honestly don't know what i was thinking about when i wrote it, it's not even very good, it just represents a certain time in my life to me. and isn't that what this is all about, poetry i mean. it's for you, for yourself, so if you manage to remind yourself of something, however large or small it is, then you were sucsesful in writting the poem, i'm rambling, sorry.  so jefferson airplane, this is how it all started. you want to know why i started listening to this right now today? i was watching tv, VH1 actually and they were playing the 50 worst songs ever. and there was a song by "starship", and those of you who may not know this, i'll tell. the singer and songwritter from "starship" is the same person as the one from "jefferson airplane" i admit it was a horrible song they played on the tv "we built this city out of rock and roll" but it jogged my memory so i sat up, went into my room and turned this on. so that is that, and i have got my itchyness out.  i'm really trying to quiet smoking, or at least cut back considerably. it's starting to get to me, and i'm starting to get to myself. goodnight. love from, allie

       Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school Tell your mum what to expect, she says it's right out of the blue Do you went to work in Debenham's, because that's what they expect Start in Lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor  And the head said that you always were a queer one from the start For careers you say you went to be remembered for your art Your obsessions get you known throughout the school for being strange Making life-size models of the Velvet Underground in clay  In the queue for lunch they take the piss, you've got no appetite And the rumour is you never go with boys and you are tight So they jab you with a fork, you drop the tray and go berserk While your cleaning up the mess the teacher's looking up your skirt  You've been used, you're confused Write a song, I'll sing along Are you calm? Settle down Soon you will know that you are sane You're on top of the world again  Monday morning wake up knowing that you've got to go to school Mum said she had little choice when she was young, so why should you? Do you went to work in C&A, 'cause that's what they expect Move to Ladieswear and take a feel off Joe the Storeman  Tell Veronica the secrets of the boy you never kissed  She's got everything to gain 'cause she's a fat girl with a lisp She sticks up for you when you get aggravation from the snobs 'Cause you can't afford a blazer and you're always wearing clogs  At the interval you lock yourself away inside a room  Head of English gets you, asks you, "What the Hell do you think you're doing?" "Do you think you're better then the other kids? Well get outside." You've got permission, but you've got to make the bastard think he's right

      i'm out in the back house again tonight, i'm kinda depressed tonight. well no, not depressed as before, i'm just realizing, actually, i can't really put it into words, i'm happy that i'm going to art school, i just really wish i could stay here with my friends, lisa especially, i wont see her again until thanksgiving. possibly one day between art school and new york, but i don't know.    the movie i was just watching  on tv ended, it just switched over to christian conversion crap. i don't know what to call it, but it scares me    anyway... i haven't got much to say right now, it's about midnight, i think i might have a cigarette break and then go to sleep. i think i'm going to meet casey at school tomorrow around 11. i'm not allowed to go out tomorrow because i'm supposed to be packing... but i need to get out for a little bit. ooooo! aqua teen hunger force is on, i think a smoke is definately needed now.  lot's of love, allyson

      why hello, it seems like ages really, but in reality it's only been a week, a week, can you imagine? it seems so long since i've really been home. oh, i'm in L.A. at the moment, i will be here for the next 4 weeks for art school. i'm actually in valencia, a sub-whatever of l.a. it's really hot, 95 actually, i have my newly bought fan blowing on high. i have my laptop down here, and internet so all will be good.  my roomates just came back into the room, they're okay, they're from l.a. so i definately hold that against them, i dispise l.a. folk... but it's okay. i have my own little space in my room and it's really close to the exit so i can sneak out to smoke whenever i need to, i just need to find someone over 18. the search continues.  okay, well i have a lecture thing to attend now so i think i'll be going. or at least start to get on my way.  i love you all so very much, and i miss you too... please write me. i'll leave the address when i can find it.  love, allie

      i miss the city.   a lot. tomorrow is saturday, i will have classes until 4, then i'm going to hang out with my cousin for the rest of the day and part of sunday, then back here. i'm really loving my hair, it has purple streaks in it now. for once i'm really tired. i just dyed two peoples hair, i still have to do someone elses tomorrow, possibly two people tomorrow. everyone in my room and the ajoining room is dying their hair (i'm such a trend setter, ha) so they are having me do it for them. fun times.  i ate too many dried apricots and now i feel sick. i don't really want to have classes tomorrow, i don't really want to leave, i just love this place so much. "she loves me like a rock" i miss the lair as well, and all the lair folk. *tear* i need to settle my mind, perhaps my stomach as well.    The first thing I remember, I was lying in my bed I couldn't've been no more than one or two And I remember there's a radio, coming from the room next door My mother laughed the way some ladies' do  Well it's late in the evening, and the music's seeping through  The next thing I remember, I am walking down a street I'm feeling alright I'm with my boys and with my troops, yeah Down along the avenue some guys are shootin' pool And I heard the sound of acapella groups, yeah  Singin' late in the evening, and all the girls out on the stoops, yeah    we've been doing a lot of dancing in here, rather, i've been doing a lot of dancing in here and the roomies just say i'm carzy and that i'm not allowed any more sugar, so logically i dance on over to the food bar and have myself some starbursts. i've been so free here, with myself i mean, i have less inhabitions with many things, i'm more me. more truthful as well. i honestly naver want to leave.    Well I’m on my way I don’t know where I’m going I’m on my way I’m taking my time But I don’t know where    i've been listening to lots of musicc, i've been on the verge of tears more than once. sometimes, normally late at night while elliot smith is somberly whispering through my earphone, i have these huge pains inside and i just want to burst into tears, i haven't been able to. someday i'll be in a fit of tears and it will feel good, right now... now i just have to deal. i just miss everyone so much, sometimes it really takes being away from the ones you love to appreciaate them more. i knew i loved my friends before, i just never realized HOW much they meant to me. it's getting to the point where hearing their voice on the other end of the phone only makes me sad.   I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told. I have squandered my resistance, For a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises. All lies and jest. Still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.  When I left my home and my family I was no more than a boy, In the company of strangers, In the quiet of a railway station, runnin' scared. Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters, Where the ragged people go. Lookin' for the places, only they would know.  Lie-la-lie ...   that one was for clark because he was being a pretencious little musician and refused to play it for me. so i struck back in the only way i knew, i sang the song every waking moment. the boxer. it's good, it really is. i remember a few years ago before i was really aware to all the good paul simon songs, clark played it late one night and got on my case for not knowing the song. serves him right that it's now a favorite. next year, man next year we're planning revenge. i'm going to learn the song on guitar and play it everywhere, maybe right outside of his cabin. hehehe yeah.   "Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together."  "I've got some real estate here in my bag."  So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner pies  And we walked off to look for America.  "Kathy," I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh  "Michigan seems like a dream to me now  It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw  I've come to look for America."   Laughing on the bus;  Playing games with the faces;  She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy;  I said "Be careful his bowtie is really a camera."   "Toss me a cigarette, I think there's one in my raincoat."  "We smoked the last one an hour ago."  So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine  And the moon rose over an open field.   "Kathy, I'm lost," I said, though I knew she was sleeping.  "I'm empty and aching and I don't know why."  Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike:  They've all come to look for America  All come to look for America  All come to look for America     and this... this is just my favorite paul simon song, maybe... maybe not. it's my favorite to sing in the shower though. i really like the lyrics, it's like a dream to me... that life, just living, existing finding yourself. it kind of describes my existance in an obscure way. iono, i can't relly explain it properly, i just connect to it. so pass me a cigarette (THANK YOU LISA!!! I LOVE-ED YOU)    Sitting in a park in paris, france Reading the news and it sure looks bad They won’t give peace a chance That was just a dream some of us had Still a lot of lands to see But I wouldn’t want to stay here It’s too old and cold and settled in it’s ways here Oh, but california California I’m coming home I’m going to see the folks I dig I’ll even kiss a sunset pig California I’m coming home    although i'm still home in california, i miss the beach, i miss it with a consuming force inside of me. the beach, the ocean, it's a part of me and i feel disconnected here, i haven't seen that lovely ocean in two weeks, i miss it. i miss just sitting there by myself, or with others and watching the sun set. i miss getting soaking wet while still clad in school atire. i miss the sand gatting all over my bed and waking up smelling like sea salt, i miss watching the seagulls, and runners with their dogs. i miss the way how yellowish white foam sticks to the sand in cartain parts of the beach at low tide. i miss worrying about getting sand in my camera. i just miss it. thats all i want from home. i wonder if babsy would go to the beach and send me a cup of  sand? oh how i would love that.   Sunbeam shine, mousy girl on the end pew You'd stay home, oh if only I let you Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie  Municipal pool, you're a junior life saver And your friends are all serious ravers Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie Reading Judy Blume But you came too soon  You're too tall, much too tall for a boyfriend They run and hide, from your buck teeth and split ends Don't be scared, like the books you've read You're the heroine You'll be doing fine  Wouldn't you like to get away? Bestowing the memory of good and evil On the ones you left behind The heartless swine  And you love like nobody around you How you love, and a halo surrounds you Le Pastie de la Bourgeoisie In the Autumn cool Say cheerio to school   sigh, belle and sebastian. i guess that's a good note to end upon. i no longer am tired, but i am. i'm tired of waiting. do you know what i mean? i'm tired of waiting. but i wont explain and save myself from looking more like a fool. -love

      well, tonight is rather quiet, i think everyone is tired from our first day of classes. it upsets me a bit because i really want to go have another lawn party right now since curfew isn't for anouther two hours. sigh...  i have a meeting at 10:30 in which i need to attend. i think i just might go sit on the grass an draw for a bit, or write or both. i really don't like being in here when everyone is just... i don't know, not being energetic.   i love lisa, she's my new god. i'll worship with every flick of my lighter. thanks

      hello folk of the cyber world, i'm out to assult the waves once more. today was another beautiful day in valencia california, it's very hot and we're all very trendy with our 10 pizza fest on the hill and indepth conversations about hookahs. i had a bunch of stuff to do this morning which was interesting, i dropped off my artwork, i took a tour of the very confusing campus (i will get lost, i still haven't found my painting class because it's in some obscure building) then later in the day there was a faculty slide show which was really amazing but my bottom did not appreciate sitting for two hours. but that was all over by 3 so i walked the 2 miles to the market place and bought some stuff to make casey a birthday preasent, i think she'll like it.  what else, oh, night time party on the hill. i ordered a pizza which came around 9ish and my friends and i gathered on the hill across from my dorm room, sean and jason came over from the boys wing to indulge in the pizza, we played go fish and watched the stars for awhile. around 10 most everyone went inside (our inside curfew is 10:30, dorm room curfew 11:00, it's later on weekends) and i was sitting on the hill with sonya (i think that's how it's spelt) and we were talking about the bay area and such things while smoking, she's looking for a cigarettes source as well. it's definately not s.f. there are no hobo's to ask for favours.   it's finally hit me how awsome my summer is going to be here, even if the classes aren't all that great there is still so much time to just hang out and live, "i'm just liiiiving man" it makes me choke a little inside. i can't wait for tomorrow, i'm going to have my first real class, i have photography first thing in the morning, then design, then art and culture. it's going to be a real live shin-dig.  well, i think that will be all for this submission, i want to talk to some folks online for a bit and then go to sleep quasi early since i want to at least appear awake in my classes tomorrow. i've been really hyper all night though, i was having a dance party for awhile, it was good. i don't think the jolly ranchers that i just consumed are going to help me fall asleep.... hello insomnia!

      you can always tell when i've just come back from lair ofthe bear (Cal camp from which i just returned) because i start listening to simon and garfunkel incessively, yese, even more than i normally do. didn't think it was possible? well it is, i've been downloading all sorts of songs since i have a super fast internet connection here.   why simon and garfunkel? well that's pretty easy, i firstly love them, secondly i spend lots of time singing the songs at camp because our very biased music director clark (.....) likes playing the songs, except for some reason he refused to play the boxer for me this year, i struck back by singing just that song the whole time, and i mean the whole time. my goal for when i return home is learn how to play it on my guitar so next year i can go stand out infront of his cabin with dani and marianne and sing it loudly. i'm not being spiteful, it's just an ongoing joke that i felt like writting about, i realize it has no relevance to anyone who doesn't go to lair of the bear, or know who clark is. but that's OHHHHHKAY.  new subject, i have a lecture to go to in a few minutes, i feel kind of groggy but i'm loving the life around here, so much freedom, it's just like college... if i knew what that was like. except i'm waging a war with dominoes pizza, i spent a good 10 minutes yelling at the manager because they wouldn't deliver a pizza without a land line. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH CELL PHONES????? yeah... i got mad, but i still made it back 15 minutes after curfew. fuck that. i have a room that lets out into this garden thing, if i ever need to i can always sneak in then, or go out after they do the bed check. i don;t know, something like that.  but now... now i have to go outside, 20ft away from the building and indulge, then i'm off to my lecture. so may the man in the kilt wish you well.

      have you ever missed someone so much it made you cry, i mean really cry, where all vision is lost and you get a pounding headache. uncontrolably, it just creeps up on you, like a shadow after a day in the dark.   i can't express it properly in words, and ai just want to go lye down and look at the stars for awhile, for then i will know i'm not alone.   soberly without regret. (b&s)  but i'm happy deep inside, it's just sometimes, oh sometimes these waves come over me when all i can remember are these little things from past years, memories with will live on forever in my head. i love my father dearly, i only regret not doing all the things we always wanted to do, roadtrips, ball room dancing, some things you just can't get back. but i'm... i don't know, i've got only good memeories, and they will carry me through my life.

      i downloaded abba music for our dance party tonight. we started a disco train in the hallway, my roomates are at war with eachouther again, i'm stting in the corner trying to get them to calm down, but no such luck. the disco train was pretty awsome though, we were stopped from daning in the halls at 11:00 though because some bullshit about making noise and it being after curfew, i say, do what you want. but then again... i don't really want to be kicked out of the program.  we played telephone tonight outside the cafe, it was good but i'm getting ahead of myself. i locked myself up in the photo studio this evening. i shot a whole role of some of my friends dancing around, then i developed it, but not in 4 minutes as jason can do with his special harry potter magic powers. and then i printed some and was kicked out of the lab because they close it around 9:00 and it was definately past 9:00. but it was good fun. i felt super productive for once. now i'll have something to do while i'm avoiding colour printing. i don't think i'm going to like colour printing very much, black and white is just so much fun. oh well. but after we left the darkrooms we played telephone. it was very interesting. a good smoky enviroment. shrugs.   i'm going to the getty this sunday, it should be fun, i'm a little mad that they're splitting everyone up by department and making htem go at diffferent times but i have the same time as sean and jason so i don't really care all that much. actually most all of my friends here are going the same time as me, which is jawsome. yeah.... perhaps now i'll go to sleep. or download more music, or something. something not here.  laters.

      well, it's about 3:30 AM right now, i'm avoiding sleep. it's actually not hard at all, sure i'm tired, but i've also got insomnia, so i'm good. the reason for me staying up in such a ridiculous manner is to make it until 5:30 and watch the sun rise. yeah, i'm waiting for the sun to rise. one of my suitemates mentioned that she wanted to come watch with me, but she sleeping, and i kind of doubt that she will wake up. andwawy, the sun will rise over these mountains and it will be beautiful, i plan on finishing my roll of colour film on it. i need to take a lot of pictures tomorrow for my photo narrative project. shrugs. it will all work out.  right now i just got off the phone with julia, and am lying in bed listening to belle and sebastian. a sentimental peice. i hope i'm not alone in my morning sun watching ventures, i'm going to do it again next weekend as well. saturday nights.\/ sunday mornings are the only time i can do this kind of thing because sunday is the only day i don't have class, which kind of sucks. but whatever.  i'm just wasting time now. i've got two more hours to go. it's not that i'm getting tired, i'm actually pretty awake, it's just that i'm bored and running out of things to do. actually i ran out a long time ago. so i dunno. i'm bored.   i've been really enjoying art school. a whole whoole lot. it's sad to think that i'll be home in two weeks time. i don't want to go home at all. maybe to san francisco, but not home. i don't have a home there, it's just... i'm not sure exactly, i think it's going to be hard to follow rules once more, and be concious of outside factors. i just don't want to deal with the stress i get at home. besides, i'll miss my late night walks, and most of all, i'll miss the people. i'm getting really attachted to the people i'm meeting down here, i think saying goodbye is going to be a hard thing to do. after living in such close quarters with anyone for a month you're bound to grow some attatchment, so it should be really hard considering other things.  but who knows, maybe i'll keep in touch with people. sure, most of my friends who i've met here are from L.A. but not all of them. and that's important, i just don't know, i'm in a very confused state right now. and sick to boot although i am starting to get over whatever it was i had.  i like to avoid talking about things, i think that is pretty appearent, but sometimes i wish that i wasn't quite so reserved with my words. hah, my draw smells like cigarettes. i find that amusing. anyway, my avoidance. i don't know where it comes from.   i was thinking about some things for awhile this evening while i was sitting on some grass. what would happen if i took all the meds that i'm supposed to take? i mean, i remember when they first gave them to me, i remember not wanting them and choosing to toss them day after day. but maybe i should have taken them. maybe i would be a little more sane. i don't know. i think it's depression talking. but whatever. i'll see the sun rise soon and all will be better.  good night you humans, us hawks must stay alert and watch your backs.

      it's currently 11:42 PM in monday evening and one of my roomates is snoring and asleep and the other is having an emotional breakdown with her boyfriend because of csssa love. and me, well i'm here, sitting on my bed typing on my computer. life is good at the moment, other than the sour after taste of chocolate and toothpaste which is currently haunting my mouth, but whatev.   today was pretty good i guess, other than getting in quasi trouble twice for taking smoking breaks, but once again, i just don't really care. (i should really go over and my roomate number 2 feel better)  being a monday that meant we, meaning visual artsits, had art and culture (or as barbara foster refers to it "A&C", please turn off your cel phones, and bottled water only) it was alright for once, i didn't have the constant  urge to fall asleep, maybe it was the music, or the ADD afflicted speaker who was constantly talking about san francisco, home. home... sigh. after that, let's see, dinner, vons, snack core turned back into nap core. we watched are you afraid of the dark episodes curtisy of meredith and meredith.  nap core tonight was good, but it wasn't sunday's nap core. sunday's nap core was good. maybe it was just that we had mattresses there sunday, and today we didn't because they're not allowed. fuck the school. i'm so bringing mine down there on friday night. serious nap core friday night.   i had a fever earlier today, i got kind of sick during design. maybe i just convinced myself i was sick to get out of not doing anything because i had finished my chair and my smoke breaks were horribly unsuccessful. i did feel a bit like throwing up though, i blame the caf food.  speaking of food. we had some good orgasm food at nap core (snack core?). jason and i walked to vons to buy bread, brie, and avacados. ella, zully, and other wadering nap core folk indulged in the food. we were moaning it was that good. it's definately going to be lunch tomorrow as well. god food, good times. (my roomates phone just went off, it's her boyfriends, they're fighting kind of. i'm not really sure)   well, i'm thinking i'm going to try and sleep soon, i'd like to break the insomnia thing. tomorrow is the sleepover in the music hall, some 14 hour composition. in my mind it's just an extended nap core. it should be good, i'm trying to harass everyone i know to come.
