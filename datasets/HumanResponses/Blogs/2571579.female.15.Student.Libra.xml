      Hey...right now i'm babysitting for my cousins. UG! They make me NOT want to have kids at all. I was half asleep and my dad told me they were commin over and i had to watch them.  As i rolled over in bed for the 20th time after that i heard the door open and the noise began.  My aunt yelled up, 'Casey no sleepin on the job' i wanted to sink into my bed and never get up...but i had to and now they're making noise and being annoying...What kind of a winter is this? The sun is blinding. It seems like spring already. I feel bad for the skiiers and snowboarders, which i would be one of but i hurt my knee, but i stil wanted to go up there and eat some of Montage's great food lol Well i should go before the kids destroy anything, later

       Last Entry! For two weeks at least hehe. Today was the last day at the park. It was .. well i'll just tell you what happened. I gave this kid Earl four quarters for his dollar so he could get a soda. He realized i still had his dollar and started freaking out. He was like attacking me haha. Then he started crying and ran between the baseball field fence the wall next to it. I told bobby and him and a few ppl were trying to convince him to get out. That didn't work very well and the kids started yelling that Earl was stuck. I jumped down to try and help him up to find out that he had plenty of room even the way he was sitting. However i didn't and couldnt change the way i was facing but that's ok. So the whole camp decided to flock over just as i get inbetween the fences or whatever. But he came out as soon as he realized he had everyone's attention so i slowly made my way out with him. A kid was leading him out with a ball of yarn like he was being pulled out of a mountain avalanche. Then they clapped when he got out. But that was my day.. i just cleaned up arts and crafts after that. When the day was over we went to Salerno's. That was a party as always. Bobby took one sip of his beer and we wernt sure if he was drunk from that moment or just acting like an idiot as he claimed. He was just ripping people apart and all they had to saw was bob your drunk and the whole table just died laughing. I had like 4 or 5 peices of pizza haha. He asked why i was so quiet and i said that i had nothing to say. Which wasnt true at all but i didn't want to get the jokes turned on me which could have happened easily. I know i need to say something about Al now.. i just dont know what. There are so many things i'm just not sure anymore. Matt was saying how he asked how far we got and that he called me prude cause we got next to no where. But matt knows other stuff but i dont know what really went on in that convo. Everyone left and we barely said goodbye so.. till next year i guess. That kinda sucks =\        After the party tho.. Erin, Christina, and Katie came over as our second year tradition. It was fun as always. The most eventful part was probally the drawing on me with permanent markers. They all signed their names on my legs and drew a few things here and there. It came off tho. Already actually which is interesting. Pen and stuff usually never stays on my body long. Like when i'm writing myself things to remember and then i cant read them. anyway...      Carissa called me twice to remind me that i was going to the pittston fair with her after i already knew that. However at 7:30 i called her and was planning on getting ready real quick and going but she was going to Matt's. Alrite no biggie. I chilled here with eileen and we watched Dirty Dancing Havanna Nights. Heath would be proud! I already miss her and Mand. But that was an amzing movie!!! I loved it soo much! It makes me want to move to Cuba and meet a hot guy and dance with him forever. ::sigh::       Eric Clapton- Tears in Heaven   "Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees.

       haha well today was deffinately a good one. Work was fine, last day is tomorrow so the pizza party is after but we're limited to like 6 trays cause last year we went crazy and i beleive the bill was like $206 and j. mac said he could have a banquet with that much.&nbsp;Whatever thoo. Bobby put ice down my shirt and no one did anything the whole day. He got really pissy and left like 7 times. Too bad he just drove around the block. Then he threw trail mix at me and i was like Bobby! i didn't do anything all day .. and he interrupted me and was like exactly! You havent done any thing all month except flirt with Al. So i yelled shut up and was a little embarrassed cause everyone knows it was true but i honestly dont care. Tomorrow will probally be the last day i see him for a year tho and i think i heard him mutter something about not dating sophmores so i was like .. whateverr.. After Salerno's i think Erin, Katie,and Xtina are comming over so that will be fun of course.     &nbsp;  I layed outside for a while today and painted my nails. Then i started packing and i'm deffinately not gonna have all my shit together by saturday morning omg. I cant wait for the beach tho. Me and eileen are gonna tear it up! I feel bad tho because carissa is going the same week or she was suposta and she was gonna bring me. But i'm going so she has nobody to bring. =\&nbsp; We talked that over a little and came up with nothing.. So she said she's not going which makes me feel worse cause i could be taking her but idk. I'm gonna have a good time no matter what tho... Tonight i had Anna, Mackenzie, Leah, Tara, and Carissa over and we swam and went on the trampoline and that's always a good time. I'm glad i got to chill with all of them before i go away. I also got to talk to Timmy Washo on the phone and i just remembered how much i missed him! I think that was the first time i talked to him all summer and it was for like one miute. That's alrite tho. It's something to look foreward to with the school year even tho i cant beleive i just said that haha. Well i'm gonna go and i shall update later.     &nbsp;   Phantom Planet- California &nbsp; "On the stereo listen as we go. Nothing's gonna stop me now.

       Today at work it was xmas in July. It wasnt that bad.. the kids were either talking to santa or the news men who were there. Me and a little girl annie were avoiding them the w hole day so it was cool. Then there was a storm with lots of lightning and thunder so i sat on my porch and watched it haha. Later .. like idk when but I picked up carissa and she was pissed because Matt screwed her over and went to Sopp's house with Trevor. So I called and pretended i didn't know what was going on and&nbsp; was like 'arent you going to the game with us?' He was like call sopp i gg. THen my mom brought me and carissa to Eckerd&nbsp;cause i had to get stuff for&nbsp;camp/vaca. Trevor called and was like .. do you wanna do something, i'm here with sopp and macart. Maybe they were pretending to be stupid like i did before to them. But they ended up comming here. Trevor and sopp were on my comp fuckin around with it and i think they asked Kirsten something about thomas .. and she got pissed and then i was like 'omgg i'm sorry that was matt.' but it wasnt&nbsp;but he doesnt care. I made carissa almost&nbsp;spit milk all over because i was screaming something about Emu's .. yes the ugly birds. But idk it's in a song. She ended up spitting it&nbsp;in the toilet but it was really funny.    &nbsp;  Steven and Robert left for proshot today haha . that's pretty&nbsp;sweet cause me and john get along very well with out them. But they come back the day I leave for cadet camp. I dont really care tho.. i'm not gonna cry and be like wow ill miss you soo much. And i thought i had something else to say but .. i dont think so. Peace out =)    &nbsp;   Beatles- Penny Lane &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"In penny lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.

       WOW I just realized I have like  3 days to pack for a week of 'cadet camp' (boot camp) which i'm not personally looking foreward to. I have to make sure i dont bring anything on the "Do not bring" list .. like a watch god-forbid i know what time it is. But the second week is Seaside Park with eileen! So i have to pack&nbsp;practically all of my clothes for our hott nights up on the boardwalk meeting as many people as possible. Keeping the seperate suitcases will be diffucult cause i am deffinately not the most organized one. Now on to my day..  The park was insane today. Matt's still mad at me and since it rained the wholee day the kids were all under the pavilloin and by 12 they just we're crazy. The volume level was so loud. I think cassie just left for a while cause she couldnt take it. The consulers ordered food.. and mine was forgotten =\&nbsp; So me and erin went up to Dino's and i had to pay for it again..grr. But after the crazy day i decided to go for a nice run. Of course it started pouring but whatever.. i like the rain so i kept going. I was actually went on Drakes Lane and on Bridge St then around pignatti so it was a lil different. Then since i was completly soaked i jumped in my pool and layed on a raft while it was raining haha. I got on the trampoline and bounced for like a minute and then i pulled my neck so I got off. I had to fight for the shower which i'm not used to. Steven won. Tonight i wanted to do something but i just started getting all my clothes together cause i realized i dont have much time for that. So here's to the rest of my week in Old Forge and a good Xmas in July (yea a little late) at the park tomorrow.

       Today started off average. I had work and i got hit in the head with a tennis ball while playing 'wall ball'.. i was doing good too haha. Jared Hill was there for a little and that was cool cause i dont see him that often even tho he lives right by me. I cant wait till next year when ill get to see him hopefully everyday at school. He always was on of my favorite people in the world. Tonight I went to heath's house. That was really funny in the beginning but then matt got pissed off and left. We were bustin around with him and i took&nbsp;his keys and he just freaked out.. like he was really serious. I dont know if i've seen him that way in a while but he got bitchy and left. We all kinda expected him to come back but he never did =\ I called him and he yelled at me .. a lot and i'm really not used to that from him. I feel really bad. I'll say i'm sorry again tomorrow at the park and hopefully he'll get over it. But it was a really good night besides that. The guys were all busting eachother about being gay and stuff. It was fun. Now i'm hearing that craig and heath are talking and that's really good. Me and heath were talking about that today and i told her it would be great if they could make up. Mandie still seems pissed but i hope they all .. live happily after and everything. Espically cause they're all going on&nbsp;vaca in 9 days and i wouldnt want that to be shitty for any of them. Craig might only be with them for two or something i'm not sure how it all works out but w.e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Matt is on and i'm talking to him. He's bitching that he worked all day and he didn't need girls 'playing mind games with him' .. alriteee you work at the park with me which is nothing and at a tanning place where you sit and watch girls sign in! You over react and are a drama queen.. but yet i'm still saying i'm sorry. Go figure .. more tomorrow      CCR - "I wanna know,  have you ever seen the rain , commin down on me."

       wow i havent written in a while! I've been pretty busy i guess.. doing a lot of nothing. Yesterday was Brian Simko's 16th Bday so tonight he had some people over and i chilled there. But Lets go back to at least last night. I went to the movies with him, eileen, carissa, and matt. We saw Catwoman. I thought it was good even though i couldnt sit still and randomly would rock my chair or meow at the screen for no reason. Simko got a little agrivated lol .. after the movie we decided to be different and go out the side exit. So i kicked the door ..labeled 'emergency exit' open and we walked along a white hallway. Or we can say i tried bouncing off the walls. I was a little bit hyper haha But that was fun. .. After&nbsp;me and eileen slept over carissa's. There were many good times right there. We hung out for a while and then tie-dyed shirts at 3:30ish at night. We kind of got the dye on our bodies and it is tricky to get off haha .. it was down my leg and on my foot. After that we watched "i love the 90's' .. good show. Even tho i dont watch TV i do have to say that would be worth watching. Eileen fell asleep really early so i was thinking we should do something to her. What a good friend i know lol. We decided that toothpaste was a good choice and i started putting it on her face. She half woke up and just smeared it and made it worse. Then we took two pics of me standing over her with the empty toothpaste container. I was going to take the last one on the roll with carissa in it even tho she had nothing to do with it really. As i was putting the flash on she woke up entirly so i snapped it and she was like 'uhhhh?' and then she had to get it off her face. She didn't really laugh with us but she wasnt mad or anything. I think she'll laugh once she see's the pics tho haha i cant wait! But then she went back to bed and me and carissa watched more "i love the 90's' and sang the song 'uhhhh uhhhh nananana nana nana' and 'mmm mmmm mmm' haha classics of '94 i beleive. Then we watched animal planet for a while and then just talked. As it was starting to get light out we realized it was like 6:30 so we eventually went to bed. That night .. I guess you would say.. was 'Simba's' party. It was good. Jess and Sara were there.. and Ken .. and other people i didn't know but they were all pretty cool. Then i got into a few pillow fights and then an Axe&nbsp;fight with Ken. Needeless to say.. i lost and reek of it right now. It smells great just not on me .. and not this much haha. Tomorrow I'm going to&nbsp;a Philles game in the new stadium so i guess that will be fun.. I'm not sure. I have other stories like how i almost got me and some people killed after the movie by bangging on someone's car. And another time with simko when we flipped people in a gang off and they came back and got outta their car to talk shit. But we're not gonna get to deep into all that right now.     &nbsp;  I've decided i REALLY have to make the best of this week because i leave Saturday for camp and then vaca and all. I'm not even sure i'f ill get to sleep outside on my trampoline or in the woods before all that because i have work =\&nbsp; Hopefully after vaca ill be able to do Lotsss of fun stuff but that's what happened last year. You start cramming things to make the best of your time away from school. But whatever.. i gotta be up early tomorrow so ill update about that.     &nbsp;   David Bowie- Ziggy Stardust &nbsp; "..so we bitched about his band and should we crush his sweet hands"

       ::yawn:: I'm not really that tired but.. that's Ok. I just posted that i was going to get my hair cut ect. so here I go. My hair is now dark.. i kind of wish it wasnt AS dark for the summer but whatever. It's kind of a winter do. I just cut like a half inch off but then i decided to ask for it to be angled in the front since I did it twice myself and it came out bad but that's just what happens when i get bored. I dont like it tho because it curls in by my chin and it pisses me off =\&nbsp; grrr! Whatever tho .. there's nothing i can do so ill just wait till it grows longer. I'll probally straighten it in the front now so it's not as bad. But tonight I met eileen, mandie (ackoury), and kayleen i think. haha wow it's sad that i forget her name already. But we were just walkin around and Matt saw us and picked us up. Mandie pissed me off tho because she barely knows matt and she was telling him to go drive them here and all this shit and they wanted to get eggs and she was just being an asshole. Her friend was cool tho.. except when she was playing chicken .. that was stupid. I dont even care tho. Before matt dropped me off he asked about Al.. i donno what his problem is. It's not a big deal if I like people or not...or it shouldnt be. Cause the person i've been trying to forget about for like .. years on and off.. doesnt IM me anymore. So i'm trying to be mad and say it isnt worth caring. It's only working a little bit but that's alrite. I'll get there.    &nbsp;   Dave Matthews Band- Typical Situation&nbsp;  "It all comes down to nothing"

       Well today I went to work and it was .. just regular I guess. Two little kids were gonna get married so that was funny. Then people got into a berry throwing fight and i got nailed. They dont hurt that bad tho. But anyway.. I beleive at 5:30 i have a hair apointment. I know i'm getting a trim but my hair has some realllyyy bad roots that i'm trying to let grow out. My mom said maybe they could dye the ends that are like blonde, to match my natural color.. But i dont even know. I'll post after that's done with.

       haha well  today was quite an experience. In the afternoon&nbsp;my cousins came over and Angelina went online on the American Girl Doll website. While she was on that carissa called me from Atlantic City and i told her that. Then we started reminising on the dolls we used to play with. I asked my mom to get it outta the back-back closet and found that the cool thing to have when i was 10(ish?) was  Magic Attic  Dolls! So i started playing with mine. Her name is Rose and carissa has the same one. We decided that when she comes back we're gonna play with them together and buy clothes for them.. because they are sold on the streets of scranton haha. Then tonight I went to some festival/picnic i dont even know what it was haha. I think it was in pistton tho. I went with Mandie, Heath, and Matt who all some of my favorite people in the world! While we were there we called about every other person "dirty" and that became the word of the day. I beleive that i started it haah but it was just an overall good time so it doesnt matter. When we were in Mandie's car planning on going home we had a little problem.. the car battery was dead! So she called her mom and they were going to come jump us. For the time being we tried to push the car... in the rain of course. It always rains at times like this haha. But that didn't work. I rang on the doorbell of the house we were in front of but nobody answered. A car was parked in front of ours so even if Mandie's mom came she would have had to go in the middle of the road for the jumper cables to reach. Then the lady who's car it was came (she was at the picnic) and she left and Mandie's mom came so it was all good. Her brother (who's 15) did all the hard work because Matt didn't know what he was doing. haha but Now i can say that i know how to jump a car so it was a good experience. But that's it for tonight. I have camp tomorrow so Ill update then =)&nbsp;   I got a country song that I'm rockin out too.. my love  Tim McGraw.  It's a new one by him so I give it my approval. "I became a friend, a friend would like to have...Some day I hope you get the chance to  Live like you are Dying "&nbsp;&nbsp; .. amazing song that reminds me of my counrty lovin' days

       I'd like to start off by saying that I've in a very good mood as i'm beginning this post =)&nbsp; haha .. this morning i woke up at like 9:30 and i didn't really do much all day. I put some clothes away in my room cause my bed was covered. Then i went online for a lil bit and was planning on going outside and maybe finish my book. But it turned out that I just layed out and tanned for like 2 hours. It was cool tho cause I got compliments on how dark i was tonight. Soo since today was my brother John's 10th birthday, the family..and the Chromy family went to eat at Osaca. Then i got dropped off at Jitty Joes so i could finish off my night with Carissa, Eileen, and Matt. I was glad to see Matt cause he was away all week on vaca! It's been quiet at work without him. But we just drove around for a while. Carissa was in a very bitchy mood but that's ok. We stopped by Mandie's house to visit cause Matt loves her. He said they have been like best friends since 8th grade or something. I didn't know they were that tight but whatever. It was very cool. We might all go to some picnic tomorrow so that's guarenteed to be loads of fun. After we dropped her off we went and chilled at the park and had some good talks. Then we dropped Eileen off and me and matt continued our talk so it was a good night. He understands me and i dont think a lot of people do so i'm glad to have him back. We're both kind of going through the same thing. Well that's it for now .. post tomorrow probally xoxo Case    &nbsp;   Greatful Dead- Friend of the Devil &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"Set out runnin' but I take my time.

       well i'm not sure when the last time i posted was but whatever.. Things have basically been the same.&nbsp; At work i've been playing basketball with Al and some of the kids and then playing Spit and that's about it. I cant wait for x-mas in July haha. But next week Christina wont be there =(&nbsp; but matt will. Hopefully someone will come visit me.     &nbsp;  Today i went to the mall for a&nbsp;favor for my brother steven's friend Alex. &nbsp;So i brought Simko along and we had quite an adventure. After we ate we decided to go out onto the Bridge..so we walked all the way down and then .. climbed the fence cause i wanted to go into the parking lot. But then we found that there was another, bigger fence that we couldnt climb. So we climbed the one fence again and then walked the bridge back. My dad was at the doors to get back into the mall with the biggest smirk on his face. We went to open the door and we couldnt! haha then we asked him to open it and he couldnt either. So my mom had to get a security guard to open the door for us haha .. that was great tho lmao    &nbsp;  Thenn after that event we went to the Avoca picnic. The picnic it self was kinda sucky but we went to eat somewhere else w. Jess and Sarah so that was a lot of fun. Then me and Simko walked around some more and almost got into a fight. These people drove by us and were yelling stuff out the window so as they drove away we flipped them off. A few minutes later three white guys that were acting like tough shit came outta their car and got up in our face&nbsp;and were all likee 'yo did u flip us off??" and simko was just like .. no, you were sayin stuff so we waved. Then the one guy was like yeahh show us your fingers and he did a nice spirit finger move. They got pissy and were&nbsp;just kind of&nbsp;decided to screw the whole thing and then they walked off and&nbsp;we started laughing. So&nbsp;the other one was like 'are u laughing? ill take you with my one arm'. (because he had the one in a sling haha) But whatever that was the excitement of out lives and it was pretty funny if you ask me.     &nbsp;  Hopefully the rest of my weekend will be just as good but maybe with other people who i would like to hang out with more =\&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont think i'm gonna get into that right now . maybe another time.. xoxo Casey

Then I played Al in spit and lost..and then in checkers.. and i lost again. But whatever it was fun lol. After work I had an orthodontist apt. which was not cool. He said that i have a problem with the way I swallow? how dare he! Well anyway neither of my retainers fit and i'm not getting new ones which is gay.. my teeth are probally going to move and I'm gonna be pissed and if he thinks he's getting me to put braces on again he's joking himself.   After that I went for a run .. a long one. It was exactly 50 minutes. I dont know how far really but on my schedual I'm gonna write 5 cause I'm suposta do that one day this week. Then I did some things that I was suposta be doing all summer, like step-ups and the heel-raise series. So I'm probally gonna be sore tomorrow.   I beleive tonight I'm going to Hoop City for the Hannan Varsity games, both girls and boys. The only person that i think will be playing is Eileen and i'm not even sure but I'll finish when I get back.

Then Carissa came over and..I was laying on my counter laughing about this song we made up for a family haha .. wow Then we went to Bridge Street with Lynn. Me and carissa delivered wings to Steve and we chilled on his porch for a while. That was fun haha .. between throwing eachothers shoes on the road and catching fireflies haha .. ask for detailed stories.

The whole day we sat in the pavillion..then we ordered pizza and played Bullshit haha When i got home i talked to Carolyn and we went for a run.. about 3 miles and it was raining a little so it was nice cause i like running in the rain. We talked the whole time about Prep tho and i had a cramp and we were going slower then I usually do but that's ok. I enjoyed the company.

      alrite well nobody came over tonight so i was ..lets say upset at first. But i didn't really talk to Mandie and Heath so whatever. I ended up going for a run at 9 and it was really good but then I started to feel sick so i walked some and then finished up. It was getting kind of scary tho because i felt like someone was following me and the srteets around me have very few street lights..and also things were making weird noises that i didn't like.

      alrite well this is gonna be long because my father had this guy look at my computer and they put all types of restrictions on it so i had to get him to take some of them away. grr it's all because of my brothers too. But whatever ill start with yesterday.  Me, eileen, lynn, and carissa went to eileen's grandparents house and swam in the lake for her b-day. Well me and eileen swam but it was a lottt of fun! some memories.. my sandles floating away, and the dog "deer" pissing on the canoe haha. That night carissa, eileen, brian and me chilled at my house. Macart stopped by for a little too because he's not gonna see carissa for likee 11 days :o who by the way got her belly button peirced and i finally got to see it! haha my mom said it looked cute but i just dont want it done. But whatever..me and eileen jumped in the pool and it was a good time..it was suposta be a surprise party but yaknoww.. the St. Pat's picnic got in the way and some people just couldnt give that up for the night.. hmm eileen: "I want to be normal Chet!" wow discussing Boy Meets World haha. Then she slept over and we went for a walk and got home at likee 12:45 ish lol shit that dirt road with NO lights was scarry!!.. and we stopped by Lynn's house since nobody could come with us. That was cool tho.   Today I just layed outside and read some of "Lord of the Flies" ..which sucks. Oh yeah and then i was cleaning the edges of my pool haha but then i gave that job to my  brother John. Now I'm sitting here in a wet bathing suit trying to see what i'm gonna do tonight. I beleive that Mandie and Heather are comming over but i'm not sure who else so I'll find out and wirte more later.    The Who- Teenage Wasteland   "Don't cry, don't raise your eyes.

      tonight i did end up going to the picnic .. it was kind of weird but better then i expected. I went with steve and craig and then met up with Mandie and Heather and that was ok i guess. Simko was there and that was cool. He told me kristi didn't have a problem with me like i thought she did so that's good. There is still an issue with craig, heather, and a lil bit mandie i think too and i hope they work it out because i really like all of them and i hate to see good friends like that get split up.   ..so yeah my back is really sore and it has been for a while. Andd i din't run today but i did fall asleep under outside under a blanket for a while and carissa called and i was like 'dad why didn't you tell me' and he said he tried but i was out so who knows.. i must have been tired.

      Well Steve and Carl, the E left this morning so that's kind of depressing. The whole house is a little less fun and there's not as much to do. But.. life goes on. Work was actually pretty decent and i decided that i like the baby park the best because i can chill with lil girls who are actually close to my age haha. I'm not really in the mood to run today.. but i have to so ill do that at like 6 maybe.   Tonight I want to go to the picnic but i didn't talk to anyone really about it. I was planning on meeting Mandie and Heather up there but I was gonna see if carissa or someone would come with me earlier. Hopefully ill be able to figure something out...write more when i do.

      today work kinda sucked .. i had to sit in the baby park with kids who shouldnt have been in there in the first place. I sat on the four sided sea saw or something and my ass hurts now. but kids were like harrassing me and they didn't listen and they were saying stuff they shouldnt have been and busting me about this kid. Nina came to visit me which was cool .. i wish she was working again. Matt's going on vacation next week so i might be stuck walking home =\ ooo and then my brother john threw something at a little girl and she cried for like 10 minutes and i was pissed at him and then i was arguing with my dad about it. in the end john is not going tomorrow but keira might be which is probally worse. ugg  I want to go for a run but it's too hot and i just cant run in this weather. Oh and i was going to have people over tonight but I dont think that's gonna work out either cause my mom's away and i cant deal with my father. And i need to visit my greatgrandma but my dad probally wont want to bring me but i havent seen her in a while =(  But i just read Mandie's journal and it motivated me to do sit-ups so i'm gonna go do that.. write more later   Pink Floyd- Wish You Were Here   "so you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue skys from pain?" *Kyle was playing that for me when i was talking to him on the phone yesterday so that made me happy and now i'm in a better mood =)  Well now it's 8:27 and i showered after my 45 minute/hopefully 4 mile run. My dad is bonding with steve over music like Pink Floyd ..who's CD i listened to when i was running and other real music like that. So that made me happy. I beleive people are going to carissa's after the Hannan bball game but i might just chill here. That's it for today xoxo -kacie

      this is gonna be short cause i'm soo dead. tonight i went to marissa's with some people and we chilled and had icecream from Jitty Joes.. i dont feel good tho and i'm thinkin that's because i had a brownie and icecream for dinner ... and then icecream again. So yeah now i'm talking with some people about somethings. love lifes ect. i usually say that i dont have one but if you know me you know who i like. I think i'm gonna have to wait sometime for him to figure shit out so i'm not going to be like a pain in the ass, or ill try not to at least. but i would like to hang out with him more =\   now for a good quote.."but to wait for you, well that's all I can do and that's what I've got to face" .. there's more but w.e. The song is  Gavin DeGraw- Against All Odds   and it's an awesome song.   xoxo--kacey

      so yeah.. i had work again and i got stuck in the stand again.. but whatever i dont even care, it could be worse. After work it starting raining and i wanted to go for a run then but i kinda felt sick so i waited and then by the time i went it stopped. It was really humid out tho. i ran 3 miles.. and then went swimming. Steve (guy from England) kinda scared me cause i was under water and when i came up he asked me something. Then they got into a water fight with John. that was pretty funny.   and now.. i have water in my ear (hence the name of the entry or w.e. i'm even doing now) and the plumber just finished looking at my water heater because my shower gets cold and my dad has to turn it on and off. thankfully i've only had to take one cold shower. maybe i just wont shower untill it's fixed haha   Tom Petty- Girl on LSD  ..which reminds me of good times with carissa =) who wants to do something tonight so maybe ill write again if that happens.

       Well today being the last day at the park it meens the last time I will see Al.. till next year. I did like him and today made me realize that. Matt was saying that he said I was prude because they were talking about how far me and him got when we were all sittin at the park. I thought maybe he actually cared enough to being up a conversation about me. After the park we barely said goodbye. Tonight i asked matt about that .. and he said they didn't even talk about me "soo relax" That hurt. He knows I liked him and when i said "sorry i thought maybe he cared.. nvm tho" he was like haha... I kinda need to cry tonight. It's mainly pms and i'm just not sure. Simko's trying to help me out cause i told him i was in a weird mood which makes me feel terrible. I love him so much. He's one of the greatest people alive. Like right now carissa is all about "I love MacArt" .. which was the last thing she said to me but he actually cares. Even after i told him i didn't like it and that probally hurt him and i just dont know what to do and i'm leaving tomorrow for two weeks and i have to pack now so i'm probally gonna go soon. That's enough for today tho.. hopefully I'll meet some kids at the beach to get my mind off everything. xoxo - casey       Goo Goo Dolls- Iris  "...When everything feels like the movies, yeah you bleed just to know your alive.

      Here we go. My good good good friend&nbsp;Simko told me he liked me. I knew it was comming because someone slipped it to me. (lol thanks Mandie) But he was like .. 'what would it do to our friendship if i told you i liked you' but i just said i didn't like him like that but i hope we could have the same friendship .. so we do. I guess everything's cool with that. I kinda feel bad tho. I hope i dont lead people on like that. Especially&nbsp;him cause he's an awesome kid and I would never want to hurt him. Mandie told me not to break his heart so i tried really hard. Hopefully&nbsp;he didn't like me that much. I've known him for 5 months (since feb 14th) and they have been really great. We&nbsp;became good friends almost imediately and i would trust him with my life. I really hope that&nbsp;continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;xo *later days&nbsp;   Beatles- Black Bird &nbsp; "Blackbird singing in the dead of night, take these sunken eyes and learn to see.

       Ok. This is the begining of my 'personal' blog. I'm not gonna write in this every day. Only when I feel it's necessary. It's going to be about who I like and stuff&nbsp; like that. So last person I went out with was Craig and i still kind of like him. The thing is I know I should just forget about it and move on. So i'm trying i guess. At the park Matt Wisneski comes and visits a lot because his sister goes there and I thought i liked him for a while. I'm not really sure anymore tho. First off he's only gonna be a 9th grader. So I've never even dated anyone my age let alone younger then me. On the other hand he's really funny and I love when he's there. Ok .. then I kind of think I like Al who works at the park with me. See he's 18. I play basketball with him and wow is that fun. Lets just say we get somewhat physical with it haha. We were playing 1 on 1 =)&nbsp; I also play checkers and spit with him.. and i always loose but that's Ok. He's a freshman in college tho so i'm not sure if that's too old or whatnot tho. I also dont know if he just thinks of me as a little girl. Matt knows that i kind of like him now but i dont think they really talk so that might not help. I liked him last year a little too but i didn't really talk to him as much. I guess with two weeks of the park left I better figure it out before it's too late. But I guess that's it for now and I will post again when something changes. --peace; kacie
