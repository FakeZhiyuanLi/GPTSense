      Democratic convention is happening right now! Al Gore was one of the speakers, his job was the voice of experience after "losing" (read Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men" if you don't know what I mean) in 2000. He was pretty typically. . . Al Gore. Which basically means he got his most applause when mentioning Bill Clinton. . . Jimmy Carter was very aggressive without bashing bush, but definitely had some deep stabs at Bush, especially at&nbsp;Bush's military "record". Clinton had a very good speech, which far outclassed anything Bush has uttered in the last 4 years. Democrats are looking very good, my faith that they can win this next election is rekindled!!!

      I love Fridays, they're the best!  &nbsp;Right now outside my window the wind is blowing and the rain is falling and it'd be shit to be outside right now. Well anyway, random fact of the day is that when the ground is very wet, and you step on it, you sink into it, like quicksand. Experienced that one at work today, but hey, tomarrow is saturday, good times are on their way.  -Isaiah  &nbsp;

      &nbsp; So I figure When I'm famous someday (haha yeah right) I should cronicle my life so the media doesn't screw it up (like everything else, wait did I say that!). So here goes!  7/22/04  &nbsp; whoa, i'm tired. Even though I only worked like 3 hours today, I'm totally burnt. Nothing really exciting happened today, besides me getting whooped in HORSE by my neighbor. Damn. Made a resolution last night, I'm now going to try and leave tips&nbsp;for waitresses/waiters. . . They're very unapppreciated. Joanna wanted me put her into this, so. . . Joanna is cool!!!! Yeah!!!!!  Anyway, live well, don't vote for Bush. . .  -Isaiah

      Yeah, lot's of stuff has happened since I last updated this thing (still haven't figured out why I am updating it at all, who wants to hear about my life, and I really don't have time to do it. . .). Fencing camp was great. Hanging out, listening to Logan's weird as hell stories, even falling down the mountain during the hike was cool (yes I definitely jumped over 3 and a half feet in the air!). I've confirmed that my girlfriend is very attractive and smart and cool, so that was good. . . Yeah, camp was the greatest--definitely the highlight of my summer.  So when I get back my parents buy me a laptop for my birthday. I was like where did this idea come from! Not that I'm arguing or anything, it'll be really snazzy to have. Well, I must sleep, work starts again tomarrow. . . grrrrrrrrr. . . Oh well, I need the money, I guess.
