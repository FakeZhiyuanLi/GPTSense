      Hazel was going on about calipers last night.  You know, when I'm up at the Cottage there are  urlLink tent calipers  everywhere, and I manage to keep grease from getting under my nails!

      The date with the Argentian Beef Express (ABE) has been picked up by the network!  Yes, Honest ABE, has asked for my Volvo in dating.  Date one was chocolate martinis at  urlLink Magnus , and for #2, we are going to try solid food.    Miffy, if you remember, Magnus and chocolate martinis did not always mix well.  Early into a party at Magnus (it was still light outside), I cornered a  urlLink local PBS  producer, and insisted that I needed to host a chat show RIGHT AWAY.     So, solid food in Madison.  I need suggestions.

      I am selling my house, an early  urlLink Charlotte Perkins Gilman .  A couple brought their five year old son to my first viewing.   I'm assuming the parents were advised to put his name on the mortgage for tax reasons.   So the boy, let's call him Boy, was told I had seven  urlLink  standard poodles .  Boy turned to me and said, "Let's play  Poodle Hunter !"   I thought, okay.  I said, "Okay. Let's look for the poodles in the house, Boy."  I showed Boy the first two.  "This is a tabby poodle named Badger.  And this is a black poodle named Idaho."  Said Boy,  "Their names don't really matter."   *Manversation: Males of the species speaking as gods.

      While not a behavior that i normally would  consider  participating in, it has come to my attention that blogs may be used passive-aggressively.  Well, I don't know about you, but I've been wronged!  Many times over.  Maybe i can use this as a forum to vent my irritations...Here's a story that shows just how much I hold in normally.  Just last night Laney wore the same Prada jacket that she  knew  that I had purchased.  She was with me when I got it, after all, and though I said I would  probably  return it, she couldn't have known for sure.  Well, I ended up giving it to one of the girls employed in the building.  I didn't like it much anyway.  How'd I do?  Was that passive-aggressive or just catty?  Either way, Laney deserves worse.

      The last time I was single, a long, long time ago, in a state far, far away, I gave myself what I called The Concentration Camp [Hair] Cut.  I'd wear either a torn t-shirt that read SCUM or a black slip.  And I wrote A LOT of poetry.  It wasn't bad. I was nominated for New Chicago Poet of the Year by an editor (also my professor) at  Poetry Magazine . Got published. But here, same time period, is what I called "my punk song":    I'm a girl  Blonde and blue Five foot six Enormous tits  My boyfriend f*cks me  Left and right We're so good 'Cause I'm so tight

      I just google'd an old crush.  This was a pure and innocent crush, beginning at age 9 and lasting YEARS.  Nothing ever happened.  We never kissed in a closet, or sat next to each other on the bus or even talked on the phone.  But I was in love with him.  Of course he knew I existed.  It wasn't like that.  He knew exactly who I was.  I was a Good Girl.  He would look at me, and I would BLUSH.  He was older.  He was dark.  His hair was long and ever in his face.  And I absolutely loved him.  We shall call him  Class of '83 .   Eden  and I wrote a song about him, names changed as ever:       Suzan Crumstock drives a yellow Cadillac, She also slouches and thus has a bad back.  She has two sons, one is named Scott, To this my sister said, "I need a guy who smokes pot*."  Though Suzan did beg, and Suzan did plea, My sister's heart was set on  Class of '83  .    *He was a rebel, and I thought a rebel would smoke pot, plus it rhymed with Scott.

       Eden  just let me know that I semi-ruined her last trip to London because before she left I had yet to give her my choices from  Lush .  This translated to picking up a Fever massage bar at Heathrow ON HER WAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY.  So I just asked for mini  Karma  bar, mini  Big  shampoo, mini  Retread  conditioner, mini  Mask of Magnaminty , & Mini Cooper.  Please and thank you,  Achotee HaYikara  ( My Dear Sister  in Hebrew).

      My books are off their shelves, ready to be boxed. This is proving traumatic.   Here are the piles:  fiction (stuff I would read again, lend out, or was assigned by local book club,  Madwomen in the Attic ) biography (many on Sylvia Plath and Janis Joplin) theatre (early passion turned into undergrad degree) women (later passion turned into fleeing graduate school) Jewish (former National Bible Scholar, as was Eden) poodles (remember, I have seven) humor (treasure: Comic Relief book autographed by  urlLink Richard Lewis ) financial (yes, I am the millionaire nextdoor) children's literature (two piles: favorite books growing up & books for visiting children to read) cookbooks (see humor)

      References. When I ride the bus, I don't want to make eye contact.  I don't want to talk to anyone.  I don't want to waste time either, so I read. Currently it's  The DaVinci Code  .  Today I had my sunglasses on, and I looked up and saw that a fellow passenger was wearing a t-shirt that read,  urlLink I'm Going Underground , and it had a map of the London tube stations. So I think, he's the right age to be a fan of the  The Jam  (and Paul Weller). His shirt looks old, and really doesn't fit anymore.  That must be his old Jam shirt from "the day" as old punks are known to call it.  I check out his shoes, not Cons, but up-to-date shoes. He's Indian, so he could be English. I determine I've found an old punk stuck in Madison after 40. And I go back to my reading.  *Replacements' partial lyric.  I love to sing this song in Hebrew. The lyrics work out perfectly.  The Mats are in my head because the movie  Saved!  has two of their songs,  urlLink Skyway  and  urlLink We'll Inherit the Earth .  Saved! is a wonderful film. I cried. Made me want to go back to Westerberg High in the day.

      Well, I had to go in for some job training today.&nbsp; Tedious.&nbsp; It was one of those things were you can extract about 5 minutes of useful information from a 2 hour presentation.&nbsp; Still, it got me to thinking, is my continuing single existence the result of setting my sights too high?&nbsp; I mean, the odd fellow who gave the class wouldn't normally have blipped on my radar, in fact, I had never even seen him before despite working in the same building.&nbsp; I am considering registering for all kinds of classes taught by computer geeks.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have to use glasses when I read computer monitors, but an added bonus of expanding my dating pool to include this class of men is that it hardly matters if I am bespectacled!

      My younger sister  Eden  is about to head off to the Continent for a week.  I wished her a fine breakfast.  Last summer, she was good enough to bring me back a very relevant massage bar from   Lush  . I have to say that last year's model of  urlLink Fever  was more fabulous.  The red part was not just the top of the bar, but rather a pair of lips. I so love my sister.  She also brings me back super rare English collectables of Princess Diana and Miss Piggy. Both of whom I wanted to be.

      I've confessed by love for Thursdays (weekly Garbage and Recycling Pick Up and bi-weekly Green Eggs and Chevre from the Farm), but today, oh, today is something even more rare.   It is Brush Pick Up.&nbsp; This happens only four times a year!&nbsp; Last night, chain saw'd by good neighbor Nash, I took the  urlLink invasive species  that live on my property to the curb.&nbsp; Nothing makes me happier than making the world a better place, and that begins&nbsp;with my own backyard.

      Mif, Haze and I made our pantie-run to Victoria's Secret the other afternoon.&nbsp; The plan was to each pick out a pair from the new  urlLink PINK  collection, and then leave.&nbsp; Five mintues.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  However,&nbsp;when we were ready to check out, we&nbsp;found&nbsp;a line to the back of the store.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was made up&nbsp;of very blonde, and somewhat under-dressed, high school girls buying all sorts of foundation garments.&nbsp; (I'm still taken with the amount of blondeness that is in Madison, WI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I grew up,&nbsp; let's just say, it was more small, dark and intense.)&nbsp; This is what they do after school.&nbsp; Spend $20 on panties.&nbsp; This is their enrichment.&nbsp; Maybe they need fresh panites before studying for their AP exams.&nbsp;

      Before I moved to the city from which I'm about to flee, I called City Hall to find out what day would be Garbage Day and what was their recycling policy.  Didn't ask about schools.  I just wanted to know what day I could put the trash out BEFORE I EVEN LIVED THERE.   "That is insane," Mif.

      Haze and I were dinner guests at Mif's last night.  She made, among other things, spring rolls as big as your head.  And I loved them.    Planning all along we'd go out for dessert, we headed for Michael's on Atwood for sundaes including one  Death by Chocolate , size small. Two high school boys were working behind the counter.  They were cute.  Especially the boy who had the name tag that read  Eleanor .  The other's read  Noah . It was time to get friendly.  "What's with the Eleanor thing?  Hate the former first lady?" "No, I just hate the name." "What about you," I ask Noah, "Can I call you Norah? "Norah! I'm gonna use that, " said Eleanor. Noah responds to Eleanor, "Hey, I know where you live." Eleanor counters, "Hey, I know where your sister lives."  "Shut up. I know where the lake is."

      I was just talking to a friend in the office down the hall about her first meeting with a new therapist.  She asked if I knew anything about him, but I didn't.  I do like the therapist that I am with now, but one that I have had through the same HMO was terrible.  Four years ago I was ending a long term relationship with a sculptor named Franz.  I felt terrible about ending things with Franz because I still loved him (still do, which is probably why I am destined to remain single), but I just didn't think we were good for each other anymore.  Every time I met with the therapist he would ask me if I was a virgin.  Every single time!  As if I could somehow regain my virginity* in between sessions.  I thought that was kind of odd, but at the same time I sort of liked that someone saw me as "innocent."  I didn't mind that the therapist was kind of quirky in his approach.  After I told him that I really prefered neurotic people he told me that I was a woman after his own heart.  I have to admit to being flattered.   He finally crossed the line in the therapy session before I broke up with Franz.  He asked me if I had thought about exactly how I was going to do the breaking up.  I hadn't come up with a  specific  plan yet.  He said, "Well, are you gonna break up with him, or are you going to fuck him and  then  break up with him." I told him that I hadn't thought about that.  Then I pretended I was no longer in the room.  Anyway, when you are shopping around for a therapist, I really think it is important to ask right of the bat if he/she intends to sexually harrass you.    *  Apparently one way to regain your virginity is through dentistry.  When I had my first cavity filled the other day, the dental assistant announced, "Well, looks like we've got a virgin!"

      Mif brought me Thai food for lunch today.  Squash.  So nice not to have to say, Vegetarian, please. Like when a loved one brings you coffee in the morning already with your specific combination of cream and sugar.  This person was paying attention and wants to make you happy from the moment you wake up.    Twice now, I've left the house to find dead  urlLink voles  at the front door.  There is an outside cat who leaves them for me.  The voles are always in perfect condition and only have small puncture wounds (which you really have to look for).  I may not be a cat, or even a meat-eater, but I know a cat loves me.  Coffee is hard to make when you have claws.

      I'm doing the  Cliff Notes  version of the above post's link. A woman was attacked outside of Paris.  The knief-wielding gang looked at her identity papers, saw she lived in a wealthy area, which of course made her Jewish.  And as a Jew she deserved to be attacked.  You have to wonder if her train was heading toward Vichy.

      Last night over chevre, I told Mif, "I may not believe in God, but I do beleive in love."  I think that broke her heart.  I honestly believe in love and commitment.  I can live no other way. Example: the poodles.  Do I have too many poodles?  Yes.  Was that my choice?  Yes.  But did I make a commitment to them?  Yes.  They are mine.  In sickness and in health.    When my oldest, Cookie, was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor, the oncologist told me, gently, "She's in a lot of pain." And like a mother, I wanted to kiss her on the head and make it better. Make it go away.  Pull the cancer into my own body if I could.   But I couldn't make it better, and neither could the doctors at the vet school.  Cookie was done.  We gave her pain medication and her favorite foods, and I kissed her head until the pain was gone.  It left her head and entered my heart.

      Today, in the mail, I got some Valpack coupons, a replacement debit card for my defunct checking account from my old bank... and something advertising "free cotton panty for you and your friends!" on shiny magenta paper with hot pink polka dots.  I opened it to discover a credit card-type piece of plastic with the same magenta/hot pink theme as the cover.  Upon reading the  very  informative flyer, I figured out that this little card entitles me (and up to 6 of my nearest and dearest friends) to receive one pair of cotton panties from Victoria's Secret's PINK collection  each .  So what say you, ladies?  Shall we make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Vicky's for free pink undergarments worth up to $7.50 each?!?  Do we have enough self-control/bravado to get our free panties and run away without any of us feeling the need to buy anything else?  And, more importantly, who shall we ask to round out our little panty party?

      My medication suggests I not (orange label, side view).  Nothing about heavy machinery.  Just a warning.  Nothing bad will happen, but maybe you just should not.   Not is harder than I expected.   I like to drink and write.  One followed by the other.  Long hand.  Nothing at the keyboard.  Long hand.  Wonderful, heavy lined paper, pens with inks that do not smear.  The words come from a different place.  Dare I type this, a better place.  Yes, I make mistakes, mispellings, but I do that straight, too.   I make mistakes in real life, in real time.  I visit websites I shouldn't.  I am short with people I shouldn't.  I withdraw from people I shouldn't, but then, I am also All-Access Belle.   Break up with me, and I won't argue.

      At a dinner party, a newish friend mentioned her first impression of me. I was talking to a young adult male in the hallway last summer, after hours, and said to the boy,  "I'm not coming on to you; I'm just really friendly."   Conversation killer?  Hardly.  Another friend suggested I trade mark the phrase and put it on t-shirts,  really really small t-shirts .

      Hello, darlings!!  I feel like  such  a bad person -- I have been phoning in my blogs since we started.  Truth is, I was in  urlLink St Barts  with a boy.  It was one of those summer fling things -- we locked eyes across a room, he bought me a drink, I told him my name, and he begged me to come to the island with him!  Unfortunately, not only was I phoning it in from St Barts, but I was also phoning it in  in  St Barts.  Girls, remind me never to fall for that cheesy island line again!  Must have a fabulous dinner party now to weasel myself back into your good graces.  Belle, Miffy, pick a dinner party day.  Maybe a  urlLink southwest  theme?  We must have vegetarian  everything  and use the magic eraser.  What could be more fabulous???

      this morning with my excercise girls, i noticed a belly button ring lying on the sidewalk.  ick!  i know naomi campbell has one, but, come on, my body is my temple.  oh, alright, i'll admit to a little lipo here and there in my problem areas, and you are never to young to botox, but why have needles put into you  unnecessarily ?  still, i guess this beats the time when i was in new haven for my sister's graduation.  mother, daddy, and i had to walk a few blocks from parking to commencement.  when we passed the school of forestry, there was a   crack pipe  lying on the ground.  i hate to be reminded of the traps of poverty.

      Speaking of boat floating, I took a lake kayak lesson tonight - my first kayak experience ever.  (Kayaking is one of those Things Texans Don't Do.  Now I know why.)  During the 2 1/2 hours I was on the lake, I had to nearly drown myself about 40 times.  I was really really good at nearly(??) drowning part, not so good at the righting yourself thing.  I kept finding myself clinging desperately to the instructor's kayak, with my kayak upsidedown on top of me (trying to drown me!!).  It took on so much water that I had to get out and drain it once.  While getting out of the kayak, you know, on purpose, was a fun new experience, the amount of water that came out inspired panic.  Not as much panic as the drowning part, but still.  My favorite part about drowning (other than, yum, that lake taste that's still in the back of my throat) is the tremendously relieved/pathetically grateful air-gulping moment right after you realize that, despite sensory input to the contrary, you are  not , in fact, dead.  (This is the atheist's equivalent of the thankyoubabyjesus moment.)  Ugh.  I got home and piled up my wet clothes just inside the door.  My Gumby-tired arms were so weak I couldn't get out of my wet sports bra.  I stood, defeated, in my living room for a full 45 seconds, wondering if just cutting myself out wasn't the best course of action.  Double ugh.  But now that I've washed my hair 5 times (Aussie stuff rules) and thrown a frozen pizza in the oven, I feel almost human again.  C'mon Good Sense(R) Naproxen Sodium, do your thing!  Got to study some more for my Chem final tomorrow...

      So, in the space of 12 hours I have convinced myself that it would be a really great idea to run away  urlLink home  and go to med school. I take one chemistry class during summer session, and decide I really  do  want to be Kay Scarpetta or Mark Greene when I grow up. Anyone out there ever been to medical school? I have a knack for finding really ridiculous web resources like  urlLink this  and  urlLink this , and would like to talk someone sane. (Actually, the second one is kind of funny - the "___ of the day" stuff is great. And the title of the giant powerpoint slide that is first website reminds me of a kit I bought once called "So you want to teach yourself to knit!! Baby afghans!!!!") Yes, Belle, I'm asking myself 'How did I get here?', but everything's  not  the same as it ever was. Its all new and scary, and I'm a total weenie when it comes to that kind of stuff...

      Ang recently posted on  urlLink boat floating .  My boats are in a totally different fleet.    I have a friend with a shrine to  urlLink Daniel Day Lewis  in her office.  I understand and SEE that he's handsome.  I do.  But for me, I'm more into the fact that he married grown up woman and director Rebecca Miller. I don't judge books by their covers.   Hey, I even take off the dust jackets!   I just want to read it.  I love used books, books with notes written in them. In high school I would only shop at thrift stores.  I wanted clothes and books and things that had "already lived."  That's what I called it. I have books from my mother, her maiden name written on the inside cover. Precious.  Of course once I know what's inside, and I've fallen in love, it's all illuminated text.

      I wish I could feel angry and wronged today, but I think I need to accept my culpability here.  I've been thinking a lot about Franz, the sculptor, this morning.  I wonder if I drove him away by being to demanding?  Instead of forgetting the good and remembering the bad, as is my usual, I've been thinking of the fun we used to have.  I feel like people don't have fun anymore, at least I don't have fun anymore.  Where is the sense of adventure and fascination that I used to have when I left my front door?
