      alex  you turn to me and with a single wave of you hair, you flash that smile again, you know the one. the same that's sweeter than the finest scents of all the world combined. i envy how you live your life with  not a single care in the world , but for being real and living to the fullest of your potential rising. i love the way your skin is as  golden  as if you resided in the depths of the midday sun. i marvel at how you are gentle always, even as we splash and fight until we're drenched but still we laugh because for just that moment in my life,  everything was right . i hate how infinite barriers separate us, but i will never,  ever , forget you. you are the best for me that i have seen in my few and numbered years.  thank you.

      relapse  "kiss me," i said. but i am so fake. i preach it, and teach it, but quickly i break. hypocracy follows wherever i go i hate it, debate it, yet fall down below  the codon to end has repeated itself as deeper into the regression i delve i walk out to purify all of the holes that living has left deep inside of my soul  for once i am doing this only for me never when i am with someone to see it shames me, i blame me, for all that i do i should but i don't lay the hate upon you  i group them together, the things that i crave for a while i was whole, i was selfless and brave but the haze from the tip calls for my attention and it's me who deserves to be scolded and hung  so in my summation i summoned it thus i broke through the pattern, now lying in dust the light that withstands at the end of the mold is warm to my lungs, but i am so cold.

      lost  i'm writing from the summit of the throne i have created. far from prying hands and even kindness solely motivated by my grief. the cliches and angst ridden slogans follow me as i open my heart to the alter i cut myself so deep that my blood simply freezes in a continum of everlasting parody. i walk throughout the forest passing by never ending vacant cabins. i approach the long-standing fork in the road, ready to stab deep into my lungs and remove my one last "i can try." none of this means anything, but all at once is the only thing that exists in this box of deadly potions with the labels all rearranged.  the disciples of this false pretending absorb without feeling the accepted truths, far too weak to question the derivation of these fallacies.  if years from today this is somehow found, what if every word is mistaken for the lost love of teenage days that never came to surface? they will be.

      late night  a late night afternoon with clovers, present as you look me over. frosty dew that should appear, much later in the early year is what's ahead, i walk around, i feel my face, i touch the ground. and all i know that second there, is how it feels to feel your stare. i shouldn't care or dare at all, or blink as i embrace the fall. it's not as though i didn't plan things, make you think you had a hand in making me the way i've wasted, sickest, sweetest thing you've tasted. all because i let you move me, trapped inside romantic movies. when i start to walk away, i'm still to blame and not ok, and nothing's even changed at all, forgotten still becomes the fall.

      1 year today  a year it's been already, it seems. happy anniversary dear. have a drink or maybe lots more, and pretend none of this ever happened. not that i would expect in this lifetime or any others for you to recall the significance of this fatal date. i just sit here by myself and for once allow myself to remember. remember the memories and cherish them even though they do not deserve the cuts and scars i have forever etched into me from what you did to me. it's good sometimes to just think of things when you need them. things that you wouldn't even know you needed until someone came along to change you, and change the way you see everything, from continents to clarification of self, to how the world gos around without falling. it's not right for me to now not know how i lived before you. and it's so hard when you see the one who enlightened you fall to the ruin of their own teachings. it's hard to believe that such a change could come about in a small amount of time. three hundred and sixty degrees of worthless criticisms that you can now shout back at yourself. it was bad enough once, but how many times did this happen? countless. i knew how wrong it all was but spontaneous desires  have been awakened and are unsupressable.  it's more of a habit really, that i even recall your name. you should have been forgotten long ago, as i'm nearly forgotten from your endless array of companions. you see, your massive ensemble can afford to be one short. many more in fact. but in my close circle of acquaintance, there is a clear hole where you used to sit so comfortably, and no substance can fill it, though i have experimented with them all. happy anniversary dear, wouldn't have missed it for the world.

      disguise  i am a river with hazardous flow misfortune and rupture on hand the things i've been taught and have wanted to know become suddenly patent and bland  i am the dirt, and i relish my place alone and unharmed and unpaved nobody cares of the look of my face of the hurt and the sorrow i've braved  i am a tree in a forest of guilt silently choking away troubled and awed by the pain i have built waiting for one useful day  i am the air of continuous being breathed in but spit out again continually searching, undoubtedly fleeing sinking and drowning again  i am the sun, the source, the king which nobody doubts as a fact the solace and structure and calmness i bring are welcome in life's painful acts  i am a candle, i burn from the top but that isn't my one fatal wound i have been scarred from too many a drop my future is outwardly doomed  i am a symbol, a fabricate play a subjective accepted fact i have been taught on too many a day too profound to be taken aback  yet i am a girl in a fake plastic world convinced i can never get by sitting in darkness, all huddled and curled i will never reveal the true i

      it's beginning  after decades of wasted time and jumbled lines, i think it's finally clear that nothing ever will be clear in my mind. i don't know a single thing that would posess you to think that i could possibly be a normal soul, just facing the every day dramas and spilled dreams.  it lingers in the air as i walk on by, staring at my imperfections, though only from the waist down momentarily, only because that is all i see along with seventh grade shoes. it's obvious as i sit alone at the end of classes, not knowing where to focus my attention, although gossip would kill me. it doesn't make sense how the only things i live for are conspiring against me to cut and kill the only things in which i take pride. if a man wrote this he'd be considered a sensitive martyr, but i am just a lonely forgotten piece of plastic, as if they forgot a piece when the rest was shipped out to impact the world.  and it's impossible to change a century of unbalanced standards. it's funny how that works against you, even as you fight it from the depths of your insides but know you will always fail. and how every little thing is a paradox to no one else. the season of giving has given me nothing, almost wanting to die rather than face tomorrow. silently fighting my way through the wall, while over and over and i stumble and crack like the ice pond outside. it is tempting to melt it, and silently slink in but only if no one else is watching. and sadly i cover the christmas tree, while in the background people scream and cry and torture one another and live for the gold. but what does it matter? there's no symmetry! there are more on one side than the other, it must be perfect for everyone to see. how could you do such a thing that means nothing at all? i seem to have been mistaken once again in thinking i am finally free of this. so why aren't i happy? well why aren't you real? why is there no one who's willing to be pure at heart, no matter how much they preach it? i just sit here and wonder but it's all imagistic and none of these visions will begin to exist. i listen to chatter of longing and hope, and smile at the jokes but it doesn't mean a thing. uncertified surgeons have butchered my heart and laid it on a garage sale table, in the back of a darkened out of the way neighborhood corner, where no one dares to venture. this is how it feels when there is nothing more to put forth effort towards. this it how it feels to be surrounded by those who love the cardboard cut out of you, but loving not a single element of anything in the entire expanse of this everchanging universe, we "live" in. this is how it feels when you don't, and you won't, feel anything at all until the sun explodes.

      my last alarm  i cut myself today as if perhaps to say "i'll never like the weather and the pain is here to stay" i sat down on my bed "i've lost again" i said i sighed and then i cried and watched my sheets soak up the red my wound began to bleed i wonder "what is it i need?" and tomorrow all the sorrow will imprint upon my sleeve i cover it and calm "i've really done no harm" i slow my pace and wipe my face please disregard my last alarm.

      common anguish  you met me  then you let me  fall in love. you bruised me then you used me  without guidance from above. you waste me then you taste me  from the corners of my heart. you lost me and you cost me  all the trouble that i start.  it's all my fault, the things i said i'm sorry i'm so kind i nicely made your bed, and then i slit my wrists in mine. you combed your perfect hair and laid a flower on my head you sat me in your favorite chair an honor for the dead you brought her up, and stripped her off on top of my fine floor you slowly turned the music off the kind you mocked me for i'm happy in this special place but not the one you think i love to watch your saddened face so have another drink

      hate  i know you want to just forget, oh that my dear, i will not let. the pain ensued since you let me get you, and now i never will forget you. as soon as the deed was good and done, you threw me out into the street. a little strange, but hey, it's complete. why is it in secret that we always had to meet? don't you think it's strange we had to make it so discreet? why shouldn't i have yelled to the world, there's finally one to make me his girl! i should have stood in the rain and twirled. and danced and pranced 'til i made it sink in. i thought for once i might just win. but i lost again, i did, you did. i tried to make it up to you, you ran and then you hid. and now you're nowhere to be found, i frown. but every time you're near, i fear. i wish that you would disappear, i hate you.  i'm always indecisive but this time i am for sure. the only way to save me is substitute the cure. i need to be away from you, i need to find another new, i hate to say you got me but i hate you.

      an ideal gent  one, two, three, four times i hurried back for more you charmed me from top to the depth of my core oh dear don't you know that i know i'm a bore?  step up to the plate, you're the last hopeful batter whether you score is the one truthful matter take you my heart, from the depths of this platter why should you care as you watch it all shatter?  four score and infinite days since we've spoken two candid hearts but just one that is broken you'll see that i've left an invisible token forgotten and sad on the bed, you were joking  for every stab wound that has sunk into bliss another rememberance calls of your kiss silently dropped in an unfeigned abyss surely they'll notice that things are amiss?  a stereotype of the lost love avenger putting myself in the utmost of danger risking it for not much more than a stranger a childlike mistake as i layed in the manger  how can my life be reduced to this fact my whole world rotated from one painful act to you it is nothing, you've made it clear that what you lack in compassion you lack more in tact  all that i want is to want nothing more than my calm crimson locks and an old four by four to bypass these nights, and these long days of lore please don't even wave as you're slamming my door  without even talking you slowly torment i try to be kind but my patience is bent the sadness i gave and esteem that you lent are all i have left of the last ideal gent

      dead at the beginning  i am waiting for the nothing that will happen  i am staring at a screen on which responses never show i am clinging to a vision that is nothing but just that and i am sadly still perpetually alone  would you love me if me if i died? it is tempting to find out i can unearth it's almost worth it to be sure without a doubt  you see the saddest thing of all, my dear the things we've said, the meaning clear mean not a thing to you, it's true i've cried my insides out from fear  if i was gone i could move on and feel the earthly love i miss the things i crave and dodge for fear i'll never gain another kiss

      i have ripped apart my insides so that they now mold together with the surface and there is nothing left between to make me whole. i take now this knife and stab it into my chest where it will forever stay. when i am dead and buried it will still be there constantly reminding me of better worse days. the days of time that lasted ages yet went in milliseconds ticking toward the doom so sure to follow. the days of useless drama, though trying pointlessly to avoid its circumstances. they days of yearning for acceptance of the masses thereby torturing my soul. the days of striving from the depth of my core for one thing my heart perpetually desires and failing.

      "i'm shining!" she said, i'm plastic within but look she's so pretty, empty under grin "NO!" she cries, as she rips off her face "why can't you see that i can't love this place?" "it's not like i hide it or try to just fight it you do not a thing, you just sit there and light it and say, 'why is she sad, there's nothing that's wrong' but it doesn't matter, my future is gone" "shut up you rich girl, you have it all never a suffer from winter 'til fall" "then i will just die here, and you won't be sad" "you're right, you deserve it, you're nothing but bad"

      a revelation  A challenge arisen to pinpoint my state, for musings to outwardly show; A faltering picture of vacant surmisings is all I can summon, or know.  I'm dying to say that I'm lying today, but so little of former times changed. The principal whining and effort filled rhymings just different in how they're arranged.   That isn't to say that I'm wholy the same; that I'm still quite unsure from within. Now it's as if I've discovered the cause, but purposely bottle it in.   My one optimism in finding a rose though plagued with some unhidden thorns, has bettered the weather, but sure, I am never; with discontent normalcy's born  So I'm still a tree in this forest of guilt, yet disovering I can get by. The daily routine of the pain I had built is stll present, just shifted aside.

      misplaced superiority  shut yourself up is what i'm really trying to say as you stand smug and technologically advanced yet unaware of my meaningless name without regard for tasteless slurs realizing not only ethnicity's a battle and i am a woman and surely and poorly will never be better than you.  yes this powerful creator who i do not praise who i do not even believe as tangible hangs over me with every wrongdoing a veil preventing well deserved contentness and you say "that is why" "that is why she will forever delve into darkness."  and you are wrong as you don't know what i have discovered and even if you did you would be wrong and i know what you have have done blasting down the best of us for fun and i know where you find comfort tucked inside the barrel as you aim and you are wrong.  and i know what we all do and i know what we don't and how the world destroyed itself  resulting in today.  i know this and we are all wrong.

      Leaving  go down to the garden, a metre from here you'll find a canary, stop running to hear a gap between species was never so near as she tells you, she yells, "you are wrong."  you'll runn up the hill, an indignant opposer "I shouldn't have heard that, it's you who had chosen her" away in the distnce the wind calmly blows her you realize that you are not strong.  a message from home, but do you remember? the solitude that you repelled last december a conformist haven where you were a member you know now, they know how you're gone.
