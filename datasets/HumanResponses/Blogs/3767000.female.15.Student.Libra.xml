(well thats a bit of exaggeration..) but i was soOoOo scared!! i do not dare to look at my results of course.. jocelyn had to do it for me... ...     32/40!!!! first time in my entire life i've got an A for english!!! haha.. ya my english is that bad.. i couldn't believe it!!! i was just so excited that i couldn't stop laughing.. i couldn't stop jumping.. i couldn't stop hitting annabel!!! haha...

       1st blog.. hope its not gonna be the last..    &nbsp;  the past week is terrible.. actually, every week is terrible in term 3.. teachers are giving tests and homework like nobody's business.. well, these tests are to prepare for us for prelims and Os.. but we don't even have the time to study! so what's the point? these teachers think that we ONLY have their subject.. wow.. piles and piles of worksheets.. what&nbsp;s**t is this? damn..   most of my friends are getting stressed up because of this.. hope i won't be influenced by them.. all of us gonna fall into the 'depression mode' soon.. u teachers want us to work hard for our own good.. but is it really the best for us? what will happen if we reached the peak too soon? what will happen if we fall and can't find the energy to carry on?   the final words..  its for your own good..     &nbsp;  52 more days to prelims..   12 more hrs to eng prelims oral..    &nbsp;   but those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.     They will soar on wings like eagles:     they will run and not grow weary,     they will walk and not be faint...     (Isaiah 40:31)

       Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?   Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?   I must be strong and carry on,   Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.      Would you hold my hand if I saw you in heaven?   Would you help me stand if I saw you in heaven?   I'll find my way through night and day,   Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.      Time can bring you down,    time can bend your knees.   Time can break your heart,    have you begging please, begging please.      Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure,   And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.      Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?   Would it be the same if I saw you in heaven?   I must be strong and carry on, Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven.
