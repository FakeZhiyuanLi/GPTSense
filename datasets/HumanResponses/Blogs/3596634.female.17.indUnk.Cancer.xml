      my sister comes home from Europe tomorrow... i'm so excited to see her again. she spent the last month with her boyfriend backpacking through Europe. they went through France and Italy. she sounds like she's having so much fun. i'm so jealous... but i think it's so cool that she got to go to France and Italy and soak in the culture. she said that after graduation we'll go on a trip to New Zealand or something. there's no one else i'd rather do that with, at the moment. she's such a good big sister.i can't wait to pick her up at the airport tomorrow. she always has the greatest stories to tell... and now with Europe as an added feature, they're sure to be something. i'm expecting alot of drunken adventures with Mike, her boyfriend. as long as she doesn't tell me anything about the sex, i'm fine.    i finished re-decorating my room this week too. it looks so much better. the colour before was this yellow-green colour that looked like a hospital room. now it's much calmer. it's very balletic too, posters of Onegin, Swan Lake, The Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty. i also have a pair of pointe shoes signed by Xiao Nan Yu... she's such an amazing dancer. i've got my own pointe shoes in a cubbie box thing, they're old and frayed.. it looks kind of cool. before i didn't have any pictures up and my room was so bare... now it actually looks lived in. i wish Adam could see it, but he's in buffalo and right after that he'll be in Europe... Austria or Hungary or something like that. i'm going away with my friend Camilla for the long weekend. we're going up north somewhere... it'll be total jokes.   bye y'all

      summer's here and i'm painting my room green... i have green knees too (i kneeled in the paint). adam's supposed to come and help me paint but i don't think he'll show up. he took me out last night and now we're together again but taking things slow. which i want because i'm afriad of getting too close too fast again. it was so sweet, i can't even tell you how much i missed him. i'm glad that we're together, but i still want to keep my distance from getting so attatched. i don't want to center my whole life around adam, he's got his life and i want mine, but i want to be a part of his and want him in mine.and what exactly constitutes as taking it slow? i mean i thought that would mean the "i love you"s and "i miss you"s would come gradually, not all at once, but they did. i though maybe it meant not having sex and taking our time with that, but then we had amazing make-up sex. so maybe it means not spending as much time together as we used to.  i think that might be it, knowing that he doesn't have much free time to begin with so it would be extremely selfish to request that he spend all of his time with me. i understand that. i can be a very understanding person if i'm given the chance.

      i never thought i could miss some one so much... i realize that for the last two weeks i've written about nothing but adam, but i'm just so upset i don't know what else to do. nineteen days later and it still hurts like it did initially. i don't know what i can do. he told me he loves me still but he needs time to think things over, but he does love me and miss me. i want to wait for him so badly but i don't think i could stand it. and what if that time never passes and he just forgets about me while i'm still waiting? i can't think about anything but him and the way we were. he was always so afraid that i'd walk away from him, little did he know that he would be the one to walk away. every one tells me that i'll find some one better then adam but i don't think i will.... i think i'll always love him because he was my first. and right now i don't want to find any one else. he used to call me beautiful and i would just lay in his arms all night thinking how perfect things were. i don't understand anything right now. i never thought that we would be so disposable...we just fid so well together. i was so foolish to believe that something so good could happen to me. the whole time we were together i was expecting something horrible about him to come out... and nothing did so i let my guard down... and just as i did that my boyfriend broke up with me. i feel so empty and alone. i've never felt like this before.... and i've had many down times in my life... i've never had a time where i felt completely alone. i just miss him so much. i sound so stupid but it's hard to keep these things in. andrea, i am so jealous of you. i wish i didn't feel this right now. i've never been so attatched to some one before.

       i don't know what to say anymore. i just need out of this fucking town. i've gotten used to the fact that i'm alone, i've been alone most of my life... even with my brief encounter with popularity in grade 9. The thing that gets me though is that i never felt  lonely .  or if i have, it's never been this obvious. i guess i've realized alot about myself this year. through all those attempted suicides and therapy sessions... i've realized that maybe i'm supposed to be alone. i'm not unhappy... and i'm not content with my life, but i don't want to build anything on an unstable foundation... that'll just mean that my hard work will all come crumbling down around my feet.   he said "i love you" tonight, he meant it and i don't know what i'm going to do. should i let myself get hurt all over again? he sounds like he wants to get back together... but "he needs to figure some things out" about golf probably. he misses me, he remembers the way i feel in his arms, how i felt laying with him, etc... he went into great detail with the etc.  fuck

      so i think i might have just had a break through thanks to The Other Sister and a very faithful teddy bear and box of tissues. i think that i just might have realized something about adam that i can accept. i'm not going to bash him, i'm better then that, but i will say that i do not need him to be happy. i feel so foolish for cutting up my little wrist because i missed him and wanted his arms around me. i'm allowed to feel like shit, and i will for quite a long time, but i think that i'm actually ready to be friends with him. i mean real friends... because i love him and friends love each other (not the way we used to;) but all the same, friends are there for each other). i want him to read this, i want him to know that it is still eating me up inside that we'll never be together, but at least i can accept it now. 13 days after it happened i can say that i'm not angry with him, and i never will be. i just hope that he's happy and he'll be successful in life.    So after lots of junk food, crying and deliberation i still stand by my statement of: There's nothing bad to say about Mr. McCauley. i think i know him well and he wouldn't have hurt me if he wasn't going through an awful time.  And i spent the whole day watching bad romantic-comedies hoping to find some insight.... the only thing i took away from those horrible films was that every character went through pain, it's a natural function. so i've decided to take my broken heart and not try to mend it at all, because i think that it'll heal on it's own. at least i was deliriously happy for five months.

      Last night i went to this stupid athletic banquet. The music sucked, the food was half-way decent, but the company was horrid. i sat at a table with people who are generally nice but can get quite annoying, one of them being a guy that's in a class of mine. it was actually this guy to dragged me there. he asked me to dance at the first slow song (which of course had to be at the end of the whole evening)and the slow song was one that me and my ex boyfriend used to listen to and dance together to. well... during the course of that song i looked up at the guy i was dancing with and felt this huge wave of disappointment wash over me. i was half expecting to be dancing with adam. i started to cry. Again i broke another one of my rules because of adam. i always promised myself i wouldn't cry in public... but i just broke down... so i did what any other girl in my position would have done- i ran to the ladies room.  So tell me, why am i letting something like a broken heart bring me down? Why can't i just get over adam like i have with every other guy i've dated? why? because i still love him. he was the first person for me to actually love and  i feel so stupid now because he betrayed me and i broke all my rules for him. did he ever really mean it when he said "i love you", or was it just to get some ass. i loved him so much that he wouldn't have had to say those lethal three words to get me in bed. FUCK!!!

      in the last week or so i've gone through so much pain and heartache. it started with the run of Fame that my school was putting on, i expected my oh-so-loving boyfriend to show uo on opening night seeing as i bought him a ticket and he promised to come. when he didn't show up i was angry, disappointed and hurt. i was worried that something horrible had happened to him, when i got home we got into the first fight ever. that night i cried myself to sleep and didn't end up getting much sleep (about half an hour to be exact). The next day at school i had to pretend that nothing was wrong and dance in the play like i never got into a fight with some one i loved. that night i skipped the cast party and went straight home to try and make peace with Adam. Well my attempt to make peace resulted in my heart being broken. He broke up with me because he was going to be away alot during the summer and he was going through a lot of trouble with his golf tournaments. he didn't want to drag me down or leave for a tournament and come back to find out i didn't love him anymore. and just like that our five month relationship that was full of "i love you"s and "we'll always be together"s was over.  What baffles me the most is that after weeks and months of his saying "i love you", "we can make it through anything" or "i want to marry you"... he decided that i wasn't worth the effort to stay with. What changed his mind? i keep asking myself, racking my brain to find answers, hints or even the teeniest clues as to what could have made him choose to leave me. You know what comes from all that thinking? A whole lot of nothing... i find that i'm almost worst off because of those questions.  And now he wants to talk to me about something? an enigma that could potentially break my heart or start to mend it (depending on what way you want to look at things). As if the tears i've been crying for him meant nothing we could possibly get back together or he could say something absolutely devastating. and i just know he'll call me "babe", "sweetie" and all those other little pet names he had for me. twice already he's made the slip of saying "i love you", what if he really means it, or what if it has just become so habitual that it's lost all meaning.  i'll keep you "posted" jess

      this is my first post ever, you should be excited for me. i guess i made this thing so that i could rant and work out my "problems" without using the precious resources known as friends. I'm a dancer and i'm currently looking for an angent to get me commercial and theatrical auditions. my boyfriend of 5 months broke up with me eleven days ago and i'm sick of hearing the trite bullshit people feed to broken hearts in a futile and pathetic attempt to soften the blow.   Last night i got two of my friends to drive me to Adam's place so i could drop off the stuff he left at my place when we were together. he answered the door and we had a brief conversation that resulted in my running to the car and shaking uncontrollably all night. The night after he sent me a msg on msn. of course i was surprised because we've only spoken twice since the break up. Adam's message said "hey, i wanna talk to you when you've got a minute". well tell me something. What the hell does that mean? i'm sitting here in class and wondering if A) he wants to get back together, B) he wants to tell me to kill myself and never talk to him again or C)(this one is the worst for me) he wants to tell me that he "still wants to be friends". As i mull over these three options that are eating away at my sanity i wonder, which would really be the worst one for me?  Which brings me to my last question... is it really so bad to stay friends after a break up? In my case, i still talk to almost all of my ex's and consider a few "friends"... but in the case of Adam vs Jess, i think it would kill me to be able to talk to him and know that he doesn't love me anymore or that he couldn't respect me enough to be there for me the one week that was stressful and the one time i needed him there for me. And if we did get back together, what happens next time he gets stressed out (which was his reason for breaking up with me in the first place. that and he was going through a rough time with his golfing and stuff)... will he decide that he needs another break and that we'll need to break up if his stress level starts to rise? what about when he gets married? will he divorce his wife because his job is stressful?  These are my muddled and confused thoughts for today.  jess

      i realized i hadn't typed anything for a long time, not that any one is reading this... but here goes:  i have had a crazy last two weeks... i've chilled non-stop with my best girl Milla. we went to the WOSS grad parties and got trashed... met some cool guys and dare i say that there might be a budding romance between Milla and one of the guys we met that night. Milla and i went to Huntsville and made a tonne of friends and then came back and haven't stopped partying since. i think tonight was the only time that i have stayed in without seeing any of my friends.    Adam gets home from Europe on tuesday or wednesday... i'm not going to lie, i miss the guy. the night before he left he came to my house... he basically told me that this whole year was horrible for him.. full of downs, hardly any ups. the way he is now makes me wonder if he could ever feel the same way about me as i do about him. hrmmm, depressing isn't it?
