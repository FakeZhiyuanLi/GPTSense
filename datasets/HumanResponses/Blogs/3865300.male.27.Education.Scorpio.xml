       urlLink Net-Wise Teens: Safety, Ethics, and Innovation    Overall, I thought this was a very informative article.  However, I could not relate a lot of it to my teaching situation because my kids fall into that 59% of free and reduced kids that do not have a computer (article said that 41% have home internet access).  I really liked the idea that 6th graders are required to take an Internet Skills course at the Prospect Sierra school.  We have a  technology  class that is offered as an elective, but every time I walk by the classroom I see the kids just playing games on the computer.  I really think our technology instructor should read this article to get some ideas on what to teach the students.  There were many websites mentioned in the article that I have never heard of, but seem like they would be helpful.  I would like to check some of them out, and then share them with my students.  The article also brought up the point of making sure your AUP is up to date, and to be honest, I've never seen ours.  So that is something else that I am going to look into.

      I can still remember the first computer we had in our home.  My brother had a Texas Instrument from Radio Shack; the kind with the black screen and green characters.  You could type a bunch of commands in and it would make a smiley face appear, or something to that effect.  Man, technology has come a long way! throughout high school and college I used computers a lot.  I used them to type reports, and research things on the internet.  We had some really great college technology classes that were specifically created for teachers.  We learned everything on Macs because those were the computers of choice for public schools at that time. There was even a different computer lab, just for education majors, that had all Macs in it.  We learned everything from creating Word documents, to designing our own working webpage.  Everything I learned in college was very useful, and that's where I started getting really interested in technology. Once I graduated, and started teaching, I continued to incorporate technology into my classroom and my life.  The school I teach at is in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Charlotte.  The kids come from nothing, and have nothing.  The students can't even afford pencils, let alone a computer.  Some don't even have electricity!  I feel that it's my job, not because I get paid but because of the person I am, to show these kids what's out there in the world.  And I feel technology is a great way to do that.  I only have one working computer in my class, so my students always ask, "When can we go into the computer lab?"  They want to play on the computers, but we don't ever really have time to  play .  I use some of the computer programs we have at the school, such as Orchard, to help tutor the students in the mornings.   Our school actually just got a whole new computer lab with Compaqs to replace the Mac lab that had been there forever.  Along with the lab came a laptop cart that had 15 laptops, a printer, wireless router, and LCD projector.  Sadly, I was one of the only teachers all year to use it.  I liked it better than the lab because I could show the students how to do something using the LCD projector, and I could monitor their work more closely than in the lab.  Most of the teachers didn't use it because they just didn't know how.  We were told that we have a laptop cart, but there was no instruction on how to set it up and use it.  This seems to be a major downfall to incorporating technology into the classroom.  We always get great stuff, but no one ever instructs us how to use it.  It may be hard to believe, but there were a lot of teachers that didn't even know how to open a laptop or turn one on. Well, needless to say, I'm a fan of technology and computers.  I like using them, and I even took a course this past year on how to build one.  It was a workshop offered to teachers for $275, in which we built a CPU (put in the processor, motherboard, memory, hard drive, disc drive, CD-ROM, etc.) and then got to keep it.  It also came with Windows XP professional and Microsoft Office XP, which was nice because I was still using my college computer that had Windows 98 on it!  My wife complained at first, but if I wouldn't have built the new computer, we would have been out of luck for this class!

        urlLink Learning to Be Wired      The main idea of this article is that you have to be careful when trying to integrate technology into the schools. Technology should not just be a class that is offered, but it should flow through all curricular areas. It is also something that should not be forced on people as "the only way" to go. Some teachers are not ready for it, and some students are not ready as well.  The Lowell school, in this article, is a prime example of how technology can work for a school. Though Lowell was no typical school... "The school already has a corps of skilled and dedicated teachers, and it provides the supportive environment they need to do their jobs well. It already has small class sizes, perhaps the single most important prerequisite for effective teaching. It already has a beautiful, safe, newly renovated building; an extensive library; and a full range of programs in art, music, dance, drama and physical education." They initially started out as a K-3 school. When they moved to a new building, and had room to add grades 4-6, they needed to create a whole new curriculum that would set these grades apart. With the explosion of technology and a new building they could pre-wire, they thought technology would be an excellent base for the curriculum of these upper grades. With class sizes so small, they could afford to have computers, more importantly laptops, for all of the 4-6 students. They had a great technology coordinator that worked with the teachers to help them implement technology into the classrooms. This is something that all schools should have. A lot of times we have a "technology teacher" in schools that teach the kids, but not the teachers. This leads to defiant attitude towards technology. A good thing that Lowell does to encourage teachers to implement technology is that they offer $400 mini-grants to teachers that complete a course and create a computer-based project that they will actually do.  There are a lot of skeptics mentioned in this article, but I think that the Lowell school proves them all wrong. I agree with the use of technology in schools, and I feel that more money needs to be spent on it. There seems to be a big problem with where money is going, as the article states "One, there's a real displacement of resource distribution between rich and poor schools. And two, there's a push to spend money disproportionately on technology instead of on the other ways of improving school environments. Put these two things together, and you get the argument that okay, if you're going to spend more money on poor schools, let's spend it on technology." And I agree with that. I teach at a school that has a population consisting of 96% of the population on free and reduced lunch. And when I brought in the laptop cart that our school purchased last year, all of my students eyes lit up. Some had never even seen a laptop before. They loved learning and working with the computers.  The article also mentions using the technology at appropriate ages, and appropriately in the classroom. The Lowell school also set a good example at this. When 3rd grade teachers said that they did not want their students using word processing because they needed to learn how to right, the school listened. They didn't introduce computers until 4th grade. When a math teacher had success teaching her class with manipulatives, and didn't want to switch to computers, they were ok with that too. A school has to listen its teachers if it wants to make the integration of technology a success.

       urlLink  Not Your Father's Shop Class     This article is about how in high schools around the D.C. area are turning "vo-tech" into "high-tech." Some schools, such as the Chantilly Academy in Fairfax County, are offering a myriad of IT (Information Technology) courses to help students become more computer savvy. These are not just  Internet 101  classes, but opportunities to obtain some advanced certificates in IT. Students can receive certification in such advanced training courses as Microsoft Network Administration, Microsoft Networking Essentials and NT Server Four.  What does this all mean? It means that some high school graduates can immediately enter the workforce, in highpaying IT jobs, and make a bright future for themselves. The article says that IT employment is supposed to increase by 2008, stating "Among the occupations expected to expand the fastest by 2008 are database administrator (77.2 percent), systems analyst (93.6 percent), computer support specialist (102.3 percent), computer engineer (107.9 percent) and a category described as "other" computer science (117.5 percent)." These are all jobs that these high school graduates will be qualified for. Many students, on the other hand, choose to go on to college and further their education, and these certificates can help on that route as well. John Wittmann, administrator of Chantilly Academy, states "These Certifications and career academies are not substitutes for college, but the good thing is that they can help students get jobs to pay for college."  I think this is a great idea. The article states, "Recognizing a growing market, computer hardware and software manufacturers are working to put their teaching materials in U.S. high schools. Among companies with high school level instruction at Chantilly and other area schools are Cisco, Microsoft, RBT Systems and Oracle. The companies sell IT curricula, certification tests for students and instructors, upgrades and equipment, which is often available to schools at a reduced price. The school systems, in turn, provide certified teachers, teaching facilities and instructional support." I think it is necessary for companies like Cisco Systems to come into a school and say, "Hey, we're going to need some Database Managers, so this is what you should do." I think companies should have more of a part in our children's education because in the long run, that's who we're preparing them for. When we visited schools in the Netherlands, they said that this was a regular practice in their schools. They have a college track and a workforce track high school system. Big companies, Panasonic for example, come in and tell them to incorporate "this or that" into the curriculum because that is the quality they need in their employees. I feel that we need to be more acceptable to this. I feel that our educational system has to recognize that not everybody  wants  to go to college. We need to start introducing more things that the students  want  to do. It is  their  future that we are preparing them for, not  ours .
