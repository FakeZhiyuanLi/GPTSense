      I need a good nights sleep. I know I may joke about the whole Sleep Is For the Weak thing, but honestly I just don't get much in the way of sleep anymore. Never fails. I get maybe a week where I'll have a good nights sleep, but then for what seems like weeks afterwards, I'm right back to where I started.

      The bad kind. The kind that have been eating away at you for several days. The ones telling you that something bad is going to happen, but you don't know what. Those kind. Since last Friday I've felt this way. I have no idea what it could be, but something is a miss. I've been trying to shake it off for a while not, but with no luck. With each passing day it just gets worse. I guess for now I'll just have to wait and see.   On yet another note. I've got this damn song stuck in my head, so you all now get to suffer and read the lyrics. Or not. Anyways it describes kind of how I feel at the moment. &nbsp;   Looking out the door i see the rain fall upon the funeral mourners. Parading in a wake of sad relations as their shoes fill up with water. And maybe I'm too young to keep good love from going wrong But tonight you're on my mind so you never know.       &nbsp;   When I'm broken down and hungry for your love with no way to feed it. Where are you tonight, child you know how much i need it. Too young to hold on and too old to just break free and run.       &nbsp;   Sometimes a man gets carried away, when he feels like he should be having his fun. And much too blind to see the damage he's done. Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one.       &nbsp;   So I'll wait for you... and I'll burn. Will I ever see your sweet return? Oh will I ever learn?       &nbsp;   Oh lover, you should've come over. 'Cause it's not too late.       &nbsp;   Lonely is the room, the bed is made, the open window lets the rain in. Burning in the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him. My body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come.       &nbsp;   It's never over, my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder. It's never over, all my riches for her smiles when&nbsp;I slept so soft against her. It's never over, all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter. It's never over, she's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever.       &nbsp;   Well maybe i'm just too young To keep good love from going wrong.        &nbsp;   Oh... lover, you should've come over'Cause it's not too late.       &nbsp;   Well I feel too young to hold on. And I'm much too old to break free and run. Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done. Sweet lover, you should've come over. Oh, love well I'm waiting for you.       &nbsp;   Lover, you should've come over'Cause it's not too late
