      I remembered why school was so nice today. One of the videos that we were watching about WWII had the Moonlight Sonata song in it that always seems to get my attention. It's such a beautiful song because you can interpret it as a sad song but also as a romantic song, sort of the same as Aeneas' aria to Dido or at least that's what I know about the song that is very poorly entitled Cafe del Mar - Dido on my playlist. It was from some chillout CD as well as other very cool breezy songs. Yeah today was kinda ok..Well at least the last part of it..Don't quite know what happened to the middle well ok the first was ok because of school but after I got out of school things just plummeted down real fast, it's like my mood just shot right down in an instant. I went out with my buddy today. We were searching for those darn glowies but we didn't find any, hehehhehe on the way we saw a lady that had a big rip in her pants and you could see her A- cheeks. It was a bit amusing yet inconsiderate of us to laugh like idiots, what can I say we're an evil breed of people. Yeah it was fun hanging out with her today, took my mind off some things that were making me a bit depressed. You know I can handle rejection pretty well but when I looked into my nieces eyes (she came over today) I saw that she didn't know me. I was about to cry because she means so much to me. One time I remember feeling so down that I honestly thought she'd be one of the only good reasons why I should keep living, with other important reasons was my family and of course the endless fear of going to Hades. I think my relationship with my buddy is so great because we think alike, everytime we're together we never cease to steal each other's thoughts. We think the same way, react the same way and just basically be the same person but with minor differences.I'm currently listening to my fave Tiesto song of the moment UR feat. Aqualung. The verse that got stuck in my head, besides the stupid commercial for the scuba Ritz crackers, was "My heart is elated(excited) but my head is exhausted". It describes me... Yeah maybe I'll back back later today with finishing thoughts for this week if not tomorrow's always a day.

      This day is bad, I just know it . It might get better when I go to my buddy's house and go shopping for glow in the dark things for her to decorate her room with. But so far my day sucks. School wasn't bad, it was okay , you know the usual long notes, the videos, the discussion, the 15 min break and so on and so forth.something weird happened on the bus today... I was getting off the 324 and the back door wouldn't open, for the first time in my life I had to ask the driver to open up the door for me, that's was very weird. And another thing on the bus , I was getting on the 323 and one of the best teachers I've ever had Mr. Nilson was there and I passed right by his seat not noticing that he had said hello. I barely even noticed that I sat in the dead center on the back bench where I never ever ever sit. Instead of me looking at people, people were looking at me. Then I realized why, I got a little nose bleed, not very noticeable but it was a sign that something wasn't right. I had to clean up my nose so no one would notice, no one did..I came home and I cleaned it up better. I might be getting sick or something , I really don't feel too good. If I were to look up syndromes of chronic depression I'd fit the profile pretty good just about now. Yeah I know I might not look sad or anything like that, I might even look cheery at some times but that's just a cover up that my mind usually makes up as a self defense so people won't keep bugging me about why I'm not feeling so good. I don't care much for sympathy these days.

      The quote from today is another song I was listening to, on repeat . I really liked this one part when the guy was singing the chorus,he sounds very melancholy in it.I would have put another quote in it from another song I had on repeat unfortunately I don't quite understand the lyrics.Today was a though day, I didn't even get my nap today, but it's on the list. Also on the list I have : putting my my glowies, reading my notes over, chilling outside and perhaps later I will engage in some physical activity. I got the really really hard test back, low B (not good at all). I actually got the same as my buddy, it appears she had a rough time with it too because it was all from the text book :( I'll get over it. I hope the other A's I had will cover up this B.I'm not having such a good day, I mean sure school was fun today, the class had a good discussion well actually the teacher told us something very interesting about some tests this guy did on some humans. Maybe one day I'll write it in here and you'll see for yourself that yes all people are capable of killing, mutilating and abusing others no matter who they are. It was a real eye opener, this discussion.Wow I'm quite tired today, I'm planning on sleeping early today to make up the time I spend last night trying to fall asleep. Something was on my mind all night and I couldn't figure out why, almost something that related to paranoia.I was feeling uneasy, sick, just not well.yeah sleep now and maybe it'll get better.

      finally 5 more days til i get to sleep in something that doesn't have spiders crawling at head level. Also finally i'll be able to get into my room without feeling like i'm somewhat disturbing anyone or barging in on someone while they're trying to be alone. It almost feels like i'm become a prisoner of my own house. It's sad how people try to cling to me when i don't quite like attention except when i ask for attention which really isn't very often (for example i need attention when :&nbsp;i try to say something important, i get hurt or i feel neglected) not much on my mind tonight actually i just felt it was time to say this. soon i will feel&nbsp; a bit more of a individualist rather than a slave.

      For those people even care about other styles of music such as trance and dance they would know where I got this quote from. It's from Telepopmusik - breathe. I love this song and I got the chance to listen to it on my way home while sitting beside someone . "The reader" as I call him gets on at 76th and 128th where I used to get on but because of some unfortunate incident I had to change my daily routine. I've seen him before on the bus ever since I started summer school. He listens to rock as far as I know and he reads everytime I see him on the bus. I'm quite intrigued by this fellow because he always manages to stay somewhere close to my usual seat. I think he have some kind of mutual understanding now because for 3 days in a row&nbsp; I sat in the parallel seats in the back and he sat on the seats facing the front. I can't really describe it but I basically I was sitting behind him just so close that I could smell his cologne and actually read from his book (if I squinted a bit). There's certain feeling of mysteriousness about him that makes me wonder "what is he thinking". On another topic; my day was okay I guess if you think getting your tests back and watching another endless video about Hong Kong and the Canadian divisions that fought there :(. What I found interesting about this day is that I just found more reasons to not like Americans which I will not get into any time soon. I'd rather keep my strong opinions to myself because I really don't want to be used as some sort of propaganda. Wow another few days and my room will be practically evacuated :S I kinda miss my big bed oh which BTW reminds me to put up more of my glow in the dark&nbsp;things (butteflies, stars, penguins, planets&nbsp;and of course spiders). I'm thinking of redecorating my room very soon to fit my current personality :P just kidding. *sigh* I really miss my little niece and I'm afraid she will not recognize me :(

      that's from a song that i really like one other verse is " those people's persons, somedays people annoy me ". Yeah i'm not a big fan of people but that doesn't mean i don't have a sense of humanity. I do like some people but in the end if they get involved with me in any way i'll most likely do someeting that i live to regret evey minute of my life. I think the term for people who do that is "evil". i'm  not quite evil just very non-social . I can't even believe i'm still friends with my best buddy after about say 3 years. It's somewhat of a record. but my last thoughts for today are simple :i don't like people at this stage of my life, i'm stuck in evil mode and i will keep stepping on everyone's hearts until i can fill that void in my soul, the craving for  life  because now i feel like i'm  dead, numb and oh so very empty. I need a miracle to get out of this sinkhole, i need a breath of life.

      As usual waiting at my new bus station that I have to take the 324 to then walk about a block to the station. I can't believe I got out of school today without falling asleep on the way. I had a very tough day because I had a huge test and it was all *whispers*  MULTIPLE CHOICE on friggin' SCANTRONS.  Those things make me so nervous since they're so small and you have to stay within the lines or else. I think I did very bad on it cause it was super hard and most of the stuff was from the textbook and not from the notes which I adore so much since they're a whole lot easier to understand. I really needed something to cheer up my day and get my mind away from the HELLO mister with shirt off :D I actually think he's cute..I saw his face today cause he actually put his shirt on so I didn't get distracted by the perfect structure of his upper body  *drool*  and the funny thing he gets off at the same bus station as me. Now I'm not all for older men but this dude is puuuurrrrty. *looks around for sister*. It's ok I can say that I mean I'm sure she sees other cute guys at her work so it's only fair if I see cute dudes in my daily routines cause I mean the only dudes I see at school are the triple geek alliance and people I haven't seen in my entire life that go to other schools.heheheheh triple geek alliance hahahhahahah this is my hello to them "salutations!" just kidding but I did use that one on them last week. It was hilarious. I kinda feel sorry for Chris geek, he looked desperate today when we didn't say hi to him and embarrass him like we usually do. Yeah I'll be back later with more thoughts.

      Sometimes I do consider my life as being caged, sometimes the cage gets too small and I try to fit in the little corner and sometimes I'm comfortably peaceful in that state of claustrophobia.I would like some freedom but honestly.. I wouldn't really know what to do with it.It's funny how at night I begin to realize things, like yesterday night while trying to sleep without the constant fear of spiders literally crawling around my bed, I was thinking of a conversation I once had with this person about one month ago. I came to a conclusion that my life had always been about other people. I've been spending a good chunk of my life giving advice to others, helping others out of their cages, making people realize who they are and I neglected everything about me. I always do everything for the sake of others and forget about the obvious bars of steel in front of me that get thicker and keep me away from discovering who  I  really am. I get lost in everyone's personalities that I can't distinguish which one is my own, where did I lose myself?Or better yet where was I all this time? I can understand most people won't understand this babble but I do in a weird twisted way , maybe one day I'll be able to explain it better and not end up looking like a person that severely suffering from some kind of denial or worse schizophrenia. Post Scriptum: I saw The Ring tonight and Gothika they were pretty cool, made get in touch with my mind for a while.

      For those who are on my msn list know that I have a bus quote almost everyday. This is today's one. I decided this quote would be appropiate because it's that i was thinking when I&nbsp; was on the bus today on the corner of the bus where a very annoying girl always sits like a idiot and just sprawls over the whole bench and chats with her friend one of which is the infamous Pipi long stockings (she wears the funniest pink shoes ever). Well today I took that spot and reclaimed it as my own again. She kept giving me dirty looks like she knew why I specifically chose that spot. FYI this girl is almost like&nbsp; a blonde girl stuck in an eastern Indian body. I mean honestly I think they get the point when you're talking but waving your hands one of those balloon things that have air blowing in them, and they look like people, is very stupid. I thought she was going to smack me a few times with her hands and if not with her hands them with that hair she kept stroking and moving. I mean why would you even bother stroking your hair if there's not guy around to notice? Yeah sure there was some sick perverted guys at the back of the bus especially that dude I saw at the bus station today&nbsp;, if I'm not looking towards you you don't have to grab my attention because I still most likely won't look or give you my evil look. Anyways enough of those people, at home I actually got to nap today IN PEACE and quiet:D yeah I just fell asleep on my sister's bed and it was heavenly especially after the day I had at school, I thought I was going to literally start drooling on my desk if the Hitler "multimedia presentation" (aka video) wasn't going to end. P.S I've reached a new record: one week without cutting my nails thus I have really long pretty nails now :) which isn't at all like me .

      yesterday was really hot outside.It was a good day for once because i woke up happy and of course my cute black cat woke me up.I didn't do much that day except for going on the internet, talking to some friends and of course get mad at everyone in the house once again.After carefully planing out an escape to my back yard i was accompanied by my fellow inhabitants of my room. We played some badminton, tried to dodge all the bees arround then of course when outside it's 33 degrees you have to have a water fight. Endless hours passed till me and my sis went out to get some movies. Last night i watched the Butterfly Effect, it was pretty cool and might even end up on my favourite movies list then :( we HAD to watch Confessions of a teenage Drama queen. Not exactly my favourite genre of movies but oh well i survived all the pink and blondes for one day.next up on the list would be Gothika, Can't wait to watch it. I love mysterious movies and respectably horror movies. that's about it for the afternoon. P.S Ever feel like when you're in a connection with a person that you can't see you feel like you know that person? creepy...

      Ok that's it I can't censor everything that I write here with the fear that I might lose something or someone. At this stage&nbsp; I'm just about to burst into tears of anger.I'm just going write everything that totally  peeves  me off and I'm not going to step on nails trying to make everyone happy. If you don't like me I don't care much. First of all it I really hate it when people  follow me  around everywhere like I have a tail of yummy candies. It's so annoying that I have to feel all  paranoid  every single minute of my life or try to make sure that my every movement is not being somehow recorded. Another thing that really gets on my nerve is how people enjoy waking me up or making a lot of  noise  when I try to take a nap because for crying out loud my life is not pink and I do need my  rest  in order to function properly.talking about quiet I also hate it when people bug me when I'm trying to do my homework or do something that requires a lot of focus and attention. I  NEED my privacy , I don't do bad things but I do need my privacy, at least 10 minutes to be with myself and just  relax.  If I'm drawing I'm drawing and there's nothing you can do about it.I'll eat whenever I feel like it so don't try to shove food in my face and force me to eat it all. For crying out loud don't snoop in my things, if there's something you'd like to see or take ask for my permission. For me  no  and  shut up  are always valid. I make up and  change my mind  whenever I feel like it!!!!I will tell it like it is even if it's the bluntest truth ever.

      I'm sure a lot of people don't get along with others, but me I've reached a new level of not liking people. All the names are locked up in my brain and rarely taken out. One of them&nbsp;i already mentioned, Danielle. I'm currently in summer school and doing pretty well in the socials 11 class. Pretty boring class but&nbsp;I do have an interest in history so might as well do good in it right? Wrong how can you expect to be top of the class like your dear sister was when she took summer school in the same course and ended up with 98%. UHG Danilelle has the highest mark in the whole class then there's my buddy then me. After my mark there's only seventies, sixties and fails. I'm ok with my&nbsp;A just that i don't think it's fair a girl from a semi-boarding school full with racists should be top of the class in my school. It's just a bruise to my school pride and also to my intelligence. The worst thing about this person is that she brags about it too, well not covertly but you do get a sense of "i'm better than you" when you're arround her. Everytime we get a fairly hard test she tells us "you're kidding that was soo easy!" gosh how&nbsp;I would like to wipe that snobby look off her braceface!!!Well enaugh of her there's also more people that&nbsp;I really don't like, it's not that they did something bad to me is just that i don't think we click I don't have a good vibe from them. Some times&nbsp;I try to see the good side of them but i simply can't. Call me prejudiced but some people&nbsp;I just can't stand. though people are on this evil list they can get out. Take my sister for instance.. she used to annoy the living blodd out of me when&nbsp;I was younger and&nbsp;I probably did the same to her but now we get along just fine except for the little exchange of mean words like "stop taking my clothes!" if people change then yes&nbsp;I can accept them if not they're stuck on the evil list forever.Btw even my best buddy was once on my evil list but she got out of it pretty fast in grade eight. In grade seven she used to boss me arround everywhere, left scars on my poor souls forever *tear*.

      Me and My best buddy have this funny thing that we keep between us. It originated from one of my ackward moments waiting at the Newton Central for my bus to come after school on a Wednesday. This was about say 2 months ago but we still have fun with it. So it all started on this windy day, but sunny, in surrey. I was waiting on the bench when this very strange woman approaches and&nbsp; blatantly asks me for the time. Since my hearing is impaired and I usually try to force out every single f word that circulated in that bus station: I couldn't hear her till she had to do the usual "got time" hand signal. I don't quite remember if I told her the right time but I sensed she was there to stay for the whole waiting period. I took my earplug out and waited for the next question to come from that lady's mouth and sure enough it did in a very stuffed up snobby voice "does this bus go pass HMS lumber?" and i thought "wth is this woman asking me???" finally not so sure about that question I said "sure". I could have said no but then my conscience would be bugging me for hours. Then  it  came, like a strike in the face in the same snobby stuffed up voice almost with a hint of desperation "do you have a smoke?". I was about to burst out laughing but I kept it in while she kept mumbling something like "yeah I really need a smoke, the ATM card ate my card yesterday on my birthday and I couldn't get any money to buy a smoke now I can't take it anymore.. Hey do you smoke?" I was still suppressing my laughs when I did something so unlike me that was way too funny. I tired to do the opposite and I said that I don't smoke ,yet I'd like to. Now I mean what was I thinking? I guess my secret desire to be a bad girl sort of just sprung out or something but I just don't know, it was too weird to describe. A few minutes later that same hour a bus driver was carrying a little blue purse with glitter and looking though it, I was so caught up in this ackward moment that the guy starring at me behind me started laughing with me.heheh I guess grown men have their stupid little desires too sometimes and no I don't mean that in a sick way. The moral or the point of the story is that that one quote "do you have a smoke" evolved into this funny snobby accent me and my best buddy use whenever we need a good laugh or we want to make fun of someone like Danielle :D (A : stupid 90.1 percent). That's it folks.

      Yeah my brain is very talkative today, it appears I just needed some free time away from home with my buddy to just feel a bit more relaxed and not feel tense and paranoid about everything.Yeah I'm planning on writting more things that just piled up in my lil black book here. Just so I can get to peace with them.So first of all a simple question: what is up with Americans.. Honestly!!!! I mean sure they're all big and great economy and blah blah blah but they are so selfish!!! they expect everyone to support them in war and ge all "it's okay if you go bomb kids in Afghanistan!" but the truth is Americans are evil... Not all but most white rear ended, racist, superior feeling people. I have more point to back off my feelings of resentment towards these people but I shall keep them to myself because I still do fear for my life. *checks to see if anyone is aiming sniper at my head*. Another thing that is really bugging me is how people stare!!! Didn't their mammas tell them not to stare and that it's rude!! I was&nbsp;at the bus station (as always) and every single car that went by just had to look towards me, I had to double check if I wasn't sitting in front of some big ad because it felt like I was on center stage and I'm sure others feel that way too. Oh oh oh and while we're at it why do people assume things anyway? I personally don't quite assume things I just base my decisions on precedence like : "if X did that before it is very possible&nbsp; X will do it again therefore I shall do this". But yes most people assume things like is someone is wearing glasses then that person is very likely to be a geek when that person could be the dumbest person in the world. My best buddy has the same problem with people who make assumptions too, and she told me all about it. I agree 100% that it's better to get information on a subject before you let loose your mouth to spill everything that comes into one's mind. That's about it but I will be back sooner than you think.

      The bus is a really interesting thing, apart from the ripped up seats and the excessive dust on it, it has a certain  je ne sais quoi  . It's like when you're going on a bus you're immediately entrapped into a soap opera. And the characters&nbsp;are very unusual, some could be even called sociopaths. not too long ago I saw a very immense woman on the bus and I started to feel the embarrassingly for her since she didn't seem to care that 2.5 of the front seats were occupied by her. Why do people allow their bodies to disfigurate themselves so bad? I mean seriously do you have to eat the last kilogram of ice today? Yes sure I'm being a but offensive about the "health care patient that are naturally obese" but seriously why are people getting so lazy? Even in my own family I see examples of this disease called "laziness". heh sure it's fun having a remote control but for crying out loud it doesn't take that long to walk 1 meter to the tv and press a button. Oh the funny thing about being lazy is, you're getting fat while you're at it :D bonus!!!!! yeah I realized all the world's just a big ball of sleaze bags and slothy people. yes slothy is a word, comes from sloth= laziness. Don't ask me how I know that.

      So&nbsp;I finally got into my account...phew!!!! funny thing is&nbsp;I knew the pass just&nbsp;I kinda got confused on the username :P so i ended up making a new account... which now&nbsp;I am trying to delete but eh whatever.. my cuz is bugging me about giving her credit about finding the user name, but we all knew it was in my head all along (or was it?) So today i went out with my best buddy for a couple of hours. It was pretty fun, well everything is fun when you hang out with Agi poo. We went to a park and ended up watching some hot soccer players, or at least&nbsp;I think they were hot considering we were staying pretty far away from them and also considering my eyesight is largely compared to a mole's (fyi moles are blind). I'va a lot of fun these days, at skol, talking to her in our special accent. I can't believe we're almost turning into blondes, like some sort of canadian Nicky and Paris Hilton. Yes blondes!!!! Well I'm a red head now. Ha who would have thought I'd end up with amber hair? Maybe black.. but red?! I'll get some time to get used to it, I'm not used to drastic changes such as these. So nothing's really new, just same old routine: skol, sleep, tv and trying to keep my sanity in all this HEAT.&nbsp; Yeah few more days and it'll be very quiet in my living room, you'll see I'll be sleeping 5 hours instead of 2 well okay 3 :Pyeah&nbsp;It's very hard to not get mad these days, i mean u have heat, stress, issues all mixed in together and you end up with a lot of bottled up rage. Who feels these negative effects? Yes my "lovely family which&nbsp;I adore so much". *looks arround for spies*.P.S wonton and sauce is really good.

      So this is me. A bit weird and twisted but oh well we all our differences. umm not much to say in the first blog, i guess the right thing to do first is to describe myself but then again who would be reading this blog anyway..umm scratch that a lot of ppl want to read it...oh u ask such as..? well let's see there's my cousins, at least a couple of my friends and other people who have absolutly nothing else to do but read about other peoples lives since their own life is boring.So let's see now i'm short, weird to the maximum, grumpy when people bug me, a bit paranoid, some might label me as quiet though if i'm mad i can get extermly loud, always tired and you'll discover more about me on the way. Still here or have you fallen asleep? anyways in this blog i'll be talking about my life and most of the observations i note in my little black book about people who go on my 323 bus (that's why my name is buschronicles). i'll also be talking about my problems since people don't pay enaugh attention to actually hear them from me so..might as well read them..that's about it. till next time oh btw i will now keep better track on my bus quotes in this blog so expect a new post at least every 2 days.

      It's finally all over. I can sleep in from now on and not worry about that alarm thing going off in my head.I am going to miss learning more about society, history and just plain people. And you know what it might be a high b but i'm still proud , i mean i finished a grade 11 course in summer, 6 weeks!! that's pretty darn good for someone who: had a lot of issues over the summer,didn't have enough time to study, suffered from "mild" insomnia and had to take the bus to school in summer with all the heat.maybe if some of these factor would have been gone than i could have gotten that 90 i was hoping for. Well I did get 92% on my final so that's something to lighten up the big B sitting on my report card. After i got the report card i had to stay after school and volunteer with something. It appears that Mr. Nilson needed me and my best friend in the kitchen to organize a barbeque for some Korean Exchange teachers. So basically as soon as i got out of school all i did for about 2 hours was chop, dice, cut and style veggies so other people can have a good time. I guess the constant compliments we got was worth it but we also had sume fun giggling and sort of making fun of 3 teachers that started helping too after a while. It was my math teacher Ms Cheema :P and another lady that i still don't remember the name of. Boy were they unexpirienced in anything to do with cooking or kitchen ustensils. It was funny seeing grow women trying to find their way i the kitchen as me and my best buddy were like chefs (heheh Emeril: BAM BAM BAM).now ussually i'f have to write something  that happened on the bus but i decided to skip that today due to the some complaints that i got from people saying that the only thing i write about in this blog is about hot guys and people who think I'm hot. well that is all there is to think about when you're on a bus that you've been TOO many times.But  FYI  something special  did  happen on the bus but you'll just have to ask me about it.  BTW  this blog is actually about  BUSCHRONICLES!!!!  HELLO?! bus stories, bus quotes ring a bell??? gosh some people are just illiterate.

      I post up lyrics to a song and it seems everyone thinks it's a good idea. Eh that's ok, it just proves how influential I can be :P just kidding; So here goes another song that I haven't listened to in a long long time.  kinda  describes how I'm feeling : The Roc Project feat. Tina Arena - Never  I can't be with you again Don't remind me of the good times that we had Learned a lot from us since then And I  never  want these feeling to ever come again oh no!  Please don't tell me that you changed Don't wanna hear of how you've lost your "evil" ways The one's who's changed this time is me And I won't go back to feeling  helpless and deceived   Chorus: You'll  never  hear me crying You'll  never  see me trying To love you once again  Your love is so past tense

      The quote for today is the exact thing that my bus driver said as I got on the bus. I was surprised that bus drivers actually notice people that go on their bus. Well this bus driver knows me already because he used to have the 323 route for a long time. Some things never cease to surprise me but one thing did. It's so weird that people can get over things so fast but I guess it's for the good of everyone.You know I'm really lucky I never had a specific group in high school or at least I wasn't devoted to one group only because for me groups mean complications. You have people dating within groups, you have people getting mad at eachother, interest conflicts and of course you can't ever spill up anything that you hate about a member of the group because they'll all turn against you. Oh no I was happy with my best friend and whenever I lost her because of some group I always got her back or she came back to me.I guess you can call me a bit of an individualist but honestly I wouldn't like to be tied to the rules and commonalities of groups. Well today is the official day I finished socials 11 :) it was just so ironic how the test was below my expectations. Most of the questions on the final were from previous tests from which I did my studying. I basically knew the answer before reading the question since I memorized the previous tests. That really helped and I feel proud and confident that I'll do good. Maybe not as good as my goal was but still I survived a lot of hardships and conflict and issues this past month yet still I managed to balance out my life and school.I think I am ready for grade 11 now. Oh another thing that happened today before the final started, the fire alarm started going off. We thought it was a bluff and just continued getting into the test groove waiting for the teacher to tell us to start the test. But no it wasn't a bluff there really was a fire and we had to evacuate the building for 30 min. I was so mad because I was so ready do go ahead and do the test. Maybe it was a good thing the fire alarm started because when I got back into class I was working so hard and I for the first time I double checked every page as I went through the 100 questions. I only remember stalling at 3 question which got their answer after school and me and my buddy talked through the test. I actually made it to the end with 30 min to spare. I was so happy to hear the bell ring but I will miss my teacher and I'm eternally grateful for all the things I learned in that class.

      just a song that I really like by onee of my fave artists: ATB feat. Roberta - Ruby  Ruby  always waits a while before she stays Never looking back till he’s miles away Keeps her reputation like a stone She’s not really tired, she’s just overgrown  She says, "Hey, I could be wrong, But at least I'm breathing!" Hey, we could go anywhere but down. She says, "Hey, let me be you And I’ll fall down screaming!" Everything’s a miracle when you’ve got your face in the ground  Ruby never says what side she’s on She lives in the shade of unfinished songs She has got a photographic soul Everyone she meets in a fractured hole  Ruby likes the sound of people’s clothes No one ever knows when she’ll go She’s got reservations with the ghost She’s not looking back She’s just growing old

      I just read some random blog arround the site, I was and still am deadly bored and very tired. Going into the grumpiness in about 3...2....1 there I'm grumpy. AS I was saying, I was reading some pretty weird blogs and MOST of the people admitted they had mental problems in their blogs. I find that very peculiar because I consider myself as a pretty troubled person. Now what's the possiblity that most people who write in blogs are actually writting in them because it's a way to cope with their.. umm let's just call them personal issues.I think the possibility is quite high because that's why I'm writting in this blog. it's a way to cope with my endless internal conflicts and emotional distress. No Im not getting into details today because Ichose to be happy before Igo take my nap. If Idon't take my nap I'll be drooling over they keyboard at arround 10 o'clock which happens to be very very early for sleeping.At the moment I'm harboring some anger but I'll get rid of that as soon as I hit my pillow, not out of anger but purely out of comfort.Yeah yeah laugh you ignorant jerks, you think you're all that and picture perfect you slimy bag of corrupt worms seeking my destruction. PS Iwonder if being "borderline" is an actualy personality disorder or better yet a scinetifically recognized term. I should check in on that.

      Boy is it a scorcher today!!!I thought i was gonna die on my way home, luckily I was wearing light colors and my sunglasses. Today was a bit different in the morning. My friend told me last night that she was getting a ride. That made me worried about her but I got it cleared up when I saw her, alive and well coming to school without a ride. I honestly thought she was getting a ride because she might have gotten hurt during one of her family friend visits.That's not all why  my morning was different,I got off at 76 th which is unusual for me because 99% of the times i take the bus all the way to Newton central. one of the guy regulars saw me getting my backpack on and he rushed to the back of the bus to get onn at the same time as me.And as usual he hesitated a few times trying to get closer and maybe say a couple of words on the way to school. Didn't work for the poor guy, I kinda felt sorry for him because he's been secretly admiring me for about 6 weeks now. oh well.School was okay today, more notes, more videos same old.After school it was boiling outside so I skipped my daily 2 block walk and just took the 322 and actually said hi to the driver.The "reader" was on the bus as usual though he sat in a different place . Maybe he didn't notice me because of my cool shades :p and the fact that I wasn't wearing my ordinary style of clothes. Enough of me... I hope things will work out in other people's lives. I know some people have to get over some things, some have to go through things, some have to prevent things and of course some have to accomplish things.And no i'm not naming anyone because they know who they are ,(or do they). Some might assume things but that's they paranoic state of mind talking.

      I just came home from the barbeque. It was actually fun considering I was there with oh soo about 10 guys, couple girls and my sister, all of which we're older than me.the guys, well, i have to admit some we're handsome, some okay, and some just weird. At least a couple of dudes we're looking at me and my sis. What can i say we looked pretty hot today. I did my hair in a new funky way, can't really describe it but it looks like a "fun" hairstyle and my hair color got lighter too. Next things you know in autumn my hair's gonna match the ground full of amber, crimson and brown leaves embracing the earth. I wore sunglasses again so I'd feel a bit better arroundthe prople I didn't know, but I got used to most of them and ended up listening to some pretty funny conversations. Who would have thought you'd have fun in university?My sister and I, we're planning a photo shoot today. This should be fun. It's so nice to have my weekends back to myself, I'm enjoying the rest of my summer because you know what, it's not over yet.

      Well as usual my weekends get planned by someone else other than me.Today I'm going out with my sister to Bear Creek for a "barbeque" with some SFU students. I wouldn't be too surprised if I was the only youngster arround but oh well I'll just blend in with my sister, plus I have my music to keep me away from conversation like "oh really you're only in grade 11?!". yeah I hope it'll be fun. Last night was boring though, there was no one to talk to so I just decided to draw. By about nine I finished what could be one of my best portraits, and I don't even know the person that I drew. It was a guy from a forum site and he messaged me a few times telling me how hot I looked. yeah that was a break from the ordinary. Anyway I saw his profile and he had a very nice pic there of him so i jst decided to draw it: turned out good I think. I woke up about an hour ago, I didn't want to wake up from another nice dream. *sigh*  I have to go do my hair and try looking a bit older than I am maybe that will help :P whoi knows maybe I'll see someone that looks nice arround there, maybe i'll spy that person down all day heheheh no no just kidding but there's still hope.

      Yesterday night was cool. I was doing my usual routine before sleep. You know chat a bit, listen to my "before sleep" songs. Yestreday it was ATB day before sleep, listening to his songs made me feel like i was in the most wonderful places ever.I lit up 4 candles yesterday, when i blew them off the whole room seemes like paradise. I knew it was going to be a very nice night and sure enough it was. I had dreams, with people I didn't know because their faces we're all covered. I danced with someone and he smelled real nice, I was drawn to his scent, While I was dancing it felt like he didn't even hold me but a breeze was moving me. And of course since my brain has to incorporate my favourite songs in my nice dreams, the moonlight sonata was playing constantly, softly in the background.It's so nice that woke up with a smile on my face for once. All this inspires me to draw something nice, something that will make me remember last nightn forever because I know "the one" is close, just have to wait for him and one day, that one day i'll be truly happy.may it be one day, 1 year, 5 years or even a decade but I will wait for him.

      Today was okay. Raining, yet it was a warm rain. The only thing making it cold was my mind and the breeze that seems to be focused on me.i decided to finish my drawing on the bus because I didn't get the time to add finishing touches to it last night. Speaking of last night, I slept so deep again. This was the first night I didn't wake up in panic, crying and afraid. I don't remember having nightmares in the month of July but something was on my mind so often that it made me wake up sweating, curled up in a ball in the corner of my mattress. Last night I slept like an angel, little butterflies glowing above me, almost like they were watching me and the stars making little lights like a path to guide me to the world of dreams.My cat stayed with me most of the night, I felt wanted but that wasn't it. I felt wanted by something else too, not quite sure what it was.This day is probably going to be very peaceful. I still plan to take a nap because I'm exhausted. We had more notes today in class and more videos and of course he just had to give us the essay back. Bad news for once, but I'll get over it. There's still hope to get my A in socials.I'm currently listening to a sing that got stuck in my head yesterday Grace - Not over yet(BT mix). It's pretty cool "It's not over, not over , not over yet. You still want me don't you?". And no this verse form the song is not relevant to my life in any way, shape or form.yeah I'll be back with more info after I wake up.

      I just woke up from a very deeep intense sleep. it's bizarre how for 4 hours my mind was keeping me deep in the dreams world. I remember in my sleep trying to tell myself to wake up but my eyes were glues shut. When i did wake up it felt like my soul jumped back into me and that caused me to gasp to hard that it almost felt like...I came back to life.Actually my brain woke me up cause the phone rang and considering I'm always nervous and tense and my heart is always on the edge, the ringing of the phone startled me out of my sleep. Thank goodness I didn't trip on the stairs trying to go get the phone.Yumm watermelon, felt like this was the first watermelon I had ever since i was born. Every single taste bud felt it, I am feeling alive.If I stay still I can feel my heart beat going steady, steady, synchonized for the greater power that allows it to pump the essence of life inside of me; life.

      Before I didn't observe people on the bus I used to read. Usually it would be either some goosebumps story or something we had to read for school. I find it easy to read on the bus while listening to music for some reason, maybe because I don't have the fear of looking like a nerd on the bus considering everyone on there has their weird things about them. Today I was drawing on the bus. I started this picture last night while trying to study for my WW2 test which BTW didn't go so well today :( but that's ok.I like the current picture I'm drawing, maybe I'll put it up on my elfwood gallery soon .I have to take a shower today, the big dilemma is whether I should straighten my hair again or leave it messy like last time. I really likes the messiness of it, kinda fun and hot (or at least that's what all people say when they see my pic with the messy hair). yeah today was a good day unlike most of the days in this week. Today is CSI day :D yah! But I still have to sleep or else I'll grow nervous and no one likes it when Denise is grumpy, oh no no NOAA my kitty is so cute, he came to say hi to me. He luvs me. Wow I'm so hungry, but my mom said she's making me something special, I like it when some thing "special" happens around here.Well there's not much to say about to day at school. Just that Rynell is really funny, me and my buddy like to joke around with him. He reminds us of Kevin (Aka stupid kid). We didn't call Kevin that cause he was stupid just that he was so annoying, well not to me he was nice to me but he liked annoying My buddy in French class. Oh the good old times. Funny thing that happened on the way home is that I missed 3 busses in a row, I actually wanted to walk to Newton station this time even if it was raining, nice summer rain. The first bus driver that I ever had (he knows me by now) was amazed that I walked to fast from the bus station where I missed his bus to the central station. He actually told me "wow that was pretty fast walking from all the way there and catching this bus with 2 minutes to spare". I think I might have blushed and I think I said "I like walking". You know what, I do like walking.

      have you ever felt like you were keeping all your feelings so bottled up inside you that they were literally choking you? What about this : have you ever felt like you were fighting for one more breath but it never came no matter how much you tired to take it in? Have you felt like your heart was twisting inside you trying to get something out, beating faster and faster, paralyzing your brain making you cry so much that you though this could be the end?Have you ever in your life thought that a normal teenager could release so much pain, hurt and anger out at the same without damaging one's self? This is a description of my last night. I was in my room playing one last game of cards with my 2 cousins and my sister. During the course of the game one of my cousins was just vying for an argument with me and sure enaugh it did come . I ended up looking like the bad guy in the end when all I ever did was try to be nice, it was never possible. Something inside me just couldn't let everything go. I couldn't just ignore all the disrespect, the anger, the mess, the constant grumpiness. I said it all last night, i told everyone my feelings or at least the most dominant feelings i had inside at the moment and made 2 girls cry. What was i supposed to do in the situation given??? I was boiling inside! Then everyone just turned against me and I ran upstairs to the bathroom. I felt my heart cease to beat in the regular tempo then it came. I was choking on my own breath, it was a  panic attack . from that point I don't quite remember much except for my sister trying to help me and I remember my constant cries for breath, something was making my feet, face and hands go numb like they've falled asleep. Little nails everywhere and the heat came from inside out. I was burning and I didn't know what to do. Finally I remember falling asleep with my mom talking, it was like  a dream. My mom and my sister were talking but I couldn't quite understand. I just remember hearing my mind say "it's genetic". Perhaps I was concious at the moment but it all seemed like a dream. In the morning I woke up in my sister's room. My heart was at it's normal tempo again yet my breath was still heavy and it still is right now. I need some sleep, some rest from stress. Hehe think happy thoughts, if i can find any at the moment. P.S : I am sorry for being angry all the time, but considering not many people let me talk it out with them. My pain but goes deep into my heart untill it bursts. Maybe sometimes when a person says their heart is hurting and they can't breathe you should actually listen because it could be serious, sometimes fatal.

      i'm not really in the mood to write why i put this quote up. I just want to say that yes this is the day the girls go home(finally). i have a lot to do after they leave, like change my bed sheets, my pillow cases, vacuum my rooms, finish my essay then finally sleep in MY bed in MY room with my glowies :). Well on a happier note i found my pass for elftown. it's like a forum community linked to elfwood where my drawing gallery is. I have to start drawing more pics soon and put them up on the site. The best that happenes so far today is the response i got from some people of elftown when they saw my page and the pic i put up. I got 3 new elf mail messages saying either "you're hot" or "how are you". I've never felt that good in a long time.i even began to have a mini convo with this guy from Manitoba.. Who would have though that was ever possible?Oh when i came home i watched the last part of the Lord of The Rings trilogy. i saw the first 2 parts yesterday and today i saw the last part. i didn't get to see it all because some other cousins came over today. That'll just have to wait for later.Right now i'm struggling to find a good conclusion for my 5 paragraph essay on "compensation". Yeah history is kinda fun. Fast fact: Hitler commited suicide and he did actually get married.

      I appologize for the 2 day gap between blogs but i simply didn't have space and time on my pc to actually write a blog. Apparently i was "enjoying" my weekend NOT. My whole summer has been flushed down the toilet and what do i have to say "oh it's ok maybe i'll enjoy next summer". I think the month of july has  been permanently scarred and labeled as "no sleep, no quiet and no peace" month forever. I mean for crying out loud long weekends are for having fun, sleeping in, going out but noooooooooo not for me. I have to wake up early than my usual time, clean up my rooms and try to maintain my sanity amongst all this pressure and anger that i harbor in my head. I think it would have a been a lot better if i went to church yesterday, maybe i'd be able to come to peace with those feeling of rage but oh well too bad maybe next time...if there is a next time. need some time alone like maybe  2 weeks alone my myself to try to fix myself up, try to get myself out of this hole i fell into. well i have to stop my blog abruptly since my cousins are coming down... i'd better get some peace and quiet while i'm eating or else i'll go bang my head against my drawers once again.
