      I am fundamentally not wired to believe that men would want to pursue me.  I am in a situation where I must not pursue a particular man.  I refuse to accept that he does not want to pursue me.  I automatically assume that he would not want to pursue me.  Nobody is pursuing anybody. Not that anyone would want to. Particularly.  (I knew the quote but not its origin. I didn't realize this was an Orwellian situation although now that I know I'm not surprised.)

      I'm listening to Les Miserable, the London cast with Colm Wilkinson and France Ruffle. I first heard this album when I was at Otterbein. It was the start of a broadway revival of sorts and I was studying theater at the time. I remember listening to One Day More while laying on my stomach ... coloring or sketching I think .. in Cheryl's room with Caroline and a few others. Shannon and Missy were there. It was Shannon's album. Listening to the promise in this story at the start of my own artistic career.  I failed as an actor. Failed for most of the same reasons that make writing a blog so natural for me. As an actor I can never extinguish that part of me - the observing ego my therapist called it (but that was much later and in another context.) I wanted to be an artist but I can't achieve that lack of self-consciousness that is the hallmark of self-expression. In order to express the artistic intention an actor must suppress his or her conscious intent.  I'm too self-aware to be self-negating. Disappointing for an actor but it's been my saving grace as a person. The promise I hear in Les Mis these days is that of love and mercy for souls who dream and try and fail.

      Dammit my new Diablo character expired! It's so aggravating since I made a big deal about getting her special set of armor. It's especially frustrating because I know I played her for more than two hours but for some reason stupid Blizzard kept setting the clock back.  I can't believe I forgot to check it. And the most maddening part is that I've been deliberately avoiding D2 because I've felt shy and I  knew  I was being avoidant and I didn't try to stop it! Damn Damn Damn.

      I just took my remeron. That's an antidepressant that functions as a sleeping aid when you take small doses.  Sleeping is probably the key to everything for me. Or lack of sleep, rather. I've been an insomniac since I was an infant. Talking to my mom about it recently, she told me that when I was little I used to hold my eyelashes open to stay awake. I asked her why I did this and she replied, "how should I know? You couldn't talk!"  She's still bitter about the fact that neither of us slept for years when I was a baby. In fairness, I was a beastly difficult infant.  Anyway, last year my therapist suggested that getting my sleep disorders under control would make a huge difference in my mental health. I wasn't sure. I'd spent my entire life getting too little sleep and I didn't think it was a problem. I thought I was used to it.  In retrospect I guess I was used to it but it was a lousy feeling. I'm much happier now that I try to sleep regularly. Healthier too.  I'm not crazy about the remeron. I take the soltabs which just dissolve on my tongue. This is terrific because I medicine tears up my stomach and with the soltabs I don't need to eat or drink milk or anything. But I don't like how much sleep I need to feel rested in the morning - 10 hours or more most nights. And I'd like to learn to sleep without it but no luck there at all.

      Aarrgghh - I missed a day.  I'm still trying to find my range here. It's all in my voice of course because I can't speak in any voice of my own but I haven't decide yet if I want to try specializing in a sort of notes or just continue with random thoughts that occupy me before bedtime.  The point of this is that I've been feeling self-conscious about writing. I also have started to build it up into something dreadful. That's absurd of course - my only real talent is for words and writing. I enjoy writing in its way. Or more precisely, I enjoy playing with my large vocabulary.  I'm not a writer in the sense that I feel compelled to espress things. My expressions are essentially effortless. This is how I sound when I talk, folks. :)  I started a blog because I want to exercise my writing and skills and, I confess, I want to see where I can go with a public proclamation. Alright, so far the public is me and the stuffed bears on my monitor but still. Baby Steps.

      I've been staring all evening at Stardock's WinCustomize site.     urlLink http://www.wincustomize.com/   WinCustomize is the home of a useless but fascinating set of programs that lets you change the way your desktop looks. You can change icons, windows, toolbars and so on.  Ok, ok -  not  useless. With Desktop X you can easily (honest - it's really easy) create gadgets and make your desktop into an actual place to do things instead of a big empty place to stick icons. Also, WinCustomize has terrific WinAMP skins too.  But the bits I like are aimed for aesthetics - pretty not useful - and more to the point pricey given my current state of employment. The good news is that Stardock offers a variety of deal and generous upgrade pricing!  The one I've got my eye on is WindowBlinds. This is the main one that governs how you can make your windows look, via WinXP's Visual Styles. I own WB 3 and I was thinking I'd have to put off upgrading until I find some more moola. But as I was looking around the site, I realized that as a prior customer, I could upgrade for just $10! Huzzah!  WinCustomize has been running what they call the GUI Olympics where they invite different artist to prepare graphics in categories like 'Most Creative' and 'Most Usable.' I've been salivating over this skin called Opulence (click on the picture to see it up close.)    urlLink http://www.guiolympics.com/skins2004.asp?skinid=172   I promised myself a reward for doing good today (more on that later) so watch me bust out that credit card!

      If I were to do a list of birds, it would look like this:  1. Gold Finches, so bright and tiny, such pretty songs. 2. Hovering Hummingbirds like little jeweled toys. 3. Snowy Owls with golden eyes and wings as silent and enveloping as clouds.  4. Burrowing Owls always look so grumpy - verry cute! 5. Peregrines - we have these in the city where I live. Heartstopping black and white.   The differnece between my list and the original is that Sei lived in Heian Kyoto - a city of rice paper houses in the cradle of unspoiled mountains. She knew her birds as fellow citizens; I know them from zoos and nature shows.  Oh I have to tell you all about the zoo some day and all the animals which by which I've been bitten.  For birds, I've been attacked by  1. A Duck (I was trying to feed him!!!) 2. Great Horned Owl. (I was just looking at him!!!) 3. An Emu. Emus are stupid birds - all the ugliness of ostriches without their elegant height and coloring.

      Today's lesson - always write your post in Notepad and then post it into the update window.  Since I'm here, let me recommend Notepad Pro from Fookes Software.   urlLink Http://www.notetab.com   This has a tabbed multiple document interface, a terrific system called the clipbook that works for writing html, a tremendous user support group and more options than I can explain. I use it in place of the plain old windows notepad and for light html editing as well. I altered my blog template using this software.  There's a freeware version as well as two shareware options. I have the Notepad Pro version since I like to support shareware.   nbsp& -->

      Here I am writing my first blog entry. I am uncertain where I am going. I am eager to begin.  I could begin with a list of hateful things or maybe a memory of an elegant event. I have assumed a weighty persona and I am mindful that I must not disappoint. I am mindful that I just made three typos in that last sentance and Sei would not be forgiving.  Is this real? But yes - this is really a blog. Is this true? But no - I am not Sei Shonagon and this is not Sei's Pillow Book. Is this honest? But of course - why would I lie to you?  Here I am publishing my first blog entry. Wish you could be here.

       urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?   I'm checking out a feature of Blogger that I haven't tried before. It's the Blog This Button!  Basically, if you're surfing the net and find something you want to add you hit your Blog This button and little javascript window pops up with the link in place and some basic tools. It's got options to spell check, save the blog as a draft or publish it, with a drop down box where you can select your blog if you have multiples. That's a nice touch, I think.  I thought this was purely a Google Toolbar feature but I was mistaken. It is built right into the Goolge Bar, if you use that. As an Opera lover of course, I don't need the Google Bar since it's redundant (in Opera, just type your search into the address bar with a letter prefix. for example, 'g collies' searches google for collies. 'z collies' searches Amazon, 'e collies' searches ebay - pretty cool but that's Opera!)  ANYWAY - I found that for most modern browsers, there's also a bookmarklet that you just drag-n-drop to your links bar that supports Blog This! Dynamite! Let's try the spell check ...

      So did we just do a dine & dash in Iraq?  I mean, is there some way to look at this without seeing the Provisional Government folding up it's tents and stealing away? Is there some possible way to describe the hand over of power in Iraq without using phrases like 'thief in the night' or 'cut and run' or heaven help us, 'hightail'.  Yes, I know the cover-story is that we're doing this two days early to foil the dastardly terrorist. Honestly, running away because we can't stop  terrorists from attacking us is galling.  We've gone from 'Bring it on!' to 'Run away!' And it's not amusing.  And of course, they know where we live and they have our credit card on file so it's not like the dirty little coward routine is going to save us. Nor should it.

      Wow, I finally got a decent night's sleep. I've been sleep deprived for ages. My normal sleep machine got broken a few weeks back. It was a homedics version. And then I was house sitting and had to get up at odd hours to get my Dad up for work (this is the condensed version, you recall.) Anyway I bought a different brand of sleep machine - this one's from Relaxor and also has soothing lights and aromatherapy. I think it took me a few days to get used to the different rhythm of the sound.  I've been calling it a sleep machine - what it is really is a white noise machine that plays sounds like ocean waves or rainfall and masks things like traffic noise and housemates and stuff. I really like this new machine. Hopefully I've adjusted now. Or maybe I've been too sleep deprived. I managed to give myself a migraine Wednesday that I'm sure was from lack of sleep.  So the name of this blog is 'Pillow Notes' and I'd intended it to be a few random jottings before I went to bed. The thing is I keep thinking of stuff to write about at other hours of the day. I like the concept of Pillow Notes but in practice I need to keep my bedtime less fraught with incident and I need to write when the inspiration hits me.

      Hey there - I've been a ZA user for years. I had pro for a while but didn't use the ocokie features since I prefered Cookie Pal. So I switched from ZA Pro to ZA Plus. I know, I know the free one is good but I like to support companies whose products I like.  However. Since then I've fallen in love with Opera which doesn't work with Cookie Pal. Opera's only flaw is its primitive cookie handling. So now I'm trying out ZA Pro again. I've heard that it doesn't work with Opera but it seems to be doing fine here. And why the hell has knittingdragon.com tried to put a cookie on my system?  Look I know cookies are not malevolent little traitors. Usually. But it's my system dammit and I want to decide what gets stored here.  So far, Blogger seems to be running slowly. I suspect that's because I have Google ads disabled at the moment. We'll see how this goes.  Oh - some links for your enjoyment:    urlLink Opera - the World's Greatest Web App    urlLink Zone Labs - Internet Security

      Today I bought two pair of shoes: Chunky black slides with a wide elastic band, square-ish toes and a semi platform heel & sole. And I bought a pair of sandals - thongs, black with a miniature little heel and beaded instep.  Also a pair of slippers, micro-suede mules - no heels, pink soles, white and blue bands across the instep with a fabric flower in yellow on them.  And I bought taupe leather gardening gloves and garden shears. And a new work out top and capris, grey & pink. And a foot massager of clear plastic with beads that you roll your feet across. I bought groceries, and diet coke and salmon burgers and grapefruit. And I bought a Starbucks medium latte since cappucino doesn't travel as well. And a brownie.  And I bought a magazine, Computer Gaming World. And new gel pens. I like new pens. Oh and socks - 9 pairs, cotton, crew, assrt color. This is mostly from Target.  And I bought a chair and ottoman from Pier One - their St. Simeon Style. It's roomy enough that I could sit in it with a puppy.  I didn't buy a puppy today.

      I'd like to write about myself.  That is to say, this is all about myself and I don't actually want to write any of it. But the object of this exercise to face the problems I have with shyness and avoiding closeness with others. We'll just stipulate that there are 'others' somewhere out there and, if they so chose, they could in fact notice my writings.  That's no the point really. I'm doing this in search of a major audience. An audience of one would be sufficiently scary. The point, and I'd like to reiterate it since I'm rather proud of it really, is that I'm doing it.  So let's talk about me.  I worked in a library when I was a student. God I was an obnoxious little know-it-all. But I do in fact know a lot about books and writing.  I worked in the Children's Room which was terrific. Kid's books are still the best I think and I read them with pleasure. I like the pure inventiveness that is allowed to reign in kid's books. The stories don't have to be externally realistic - they work as long as the internal logic holds true. They can be a form of fantasy that needs not pay homage to D&D and before that, the Professor.  I'm not sure why I was resistant to becoming a librarian. I've considered libraries to be my natural and private game preserve. I suspect that I didn't embrace librarianship due to a combination of my reluctance to claim worldly goals and my lack of confidence in my ability to achieve them.  If you're looking for sites abotu kids' books, by the way, you've got to check out Jan Brett's page -     urlLink http://www.janbrett.com   Brett's work is outstanding of course but her website holds an incredibly generous and lovely amount of crafts and toys and pages for children.

      I am drinking a Balto Heroic Beer. It's good stuff. Very Very Good.  I say this of course but I should tell you that I don't actually like beer. I really like Bass but I don't like beer. That might change though. I might like Bass and Balto. B beers. Balto is a golden lager - very honey sweet. No bitterness. The opposite of Bass really, which is a dry bitter English pale ale. I'm not sure why I like Bass since what I hate about Beer is the dryness and the bitterness. I think I like Bass because Peter Wimsey does.  I don't drink very much. When I went off to college for the first time I made a bad habit of drinking to help me cover up my shyness. I stopped drinking when I got kicked out after my freshman year and I really didn't drink for years aftwards.  In someways this was good since I learned to move beyond my shyness. I fell back brazeness and I've always had a strong supply of that. I'm glad sort of that I didn't drink because in my stronger episodes of depression and avoidance I worry that I would have turned to that for a little help.  I drank far too much at my sister's wedding reception. Maybe 6-7 gin and tonics. That's always been my favorite. I can drink that stuff like it's 7-Up. I was pleased though that I didn't fall apart. I fell asleep immediately in the car though and then developed an intense craving for cheeseburgers.  Beer makes me feel a bit flushed and sleepy. I'd like to learn to enjoy feeling sleepy, come to think of it. But really, I'd like to learn to drink so I can enjoy the process occasionally.

      Today's update is brought to you by the letter O. And the letter P.   Why O & P? I have no idea ...

I found this while searching for Sleep Aids. As a life long insomniac I can't imagaine anything that would be worse than having funnels shoved up my nostrils whether they were called Nasal Pillows or The Fingers of Dr. Manchu.

      My gosh it's been two weeks. No wonder my nerves here are shot. I feel electricity in my ribs - ripple up my sternum. I keep hearing 'it's too hard.' It's too hard. It's too hard. Why does that come out of me? Where did that come into. I have no grace but words I have words like a song about spun from light and air that seeps through the glowing of my ribcage and illuminates my thoughts. I cannot claim to find enlightenment I can barely see where I'm going by the light of my voice. I can hardly feel my fear I can hardly breathe my fear and when the fear moves through me do my ribs tremble as they give song?

      I'm typing this in a new planning system.   urlLink FranklinCovey >  PlanPlus for Windows XP    Ok, I've mentioned before how I'm crazy about the Franklin Planners. I've been a fan of their paper planner for years but lately I've been thinking I could improve it.  So I cleared a space and really started working up a system but it's still too easy for me to ignore it sometimes. It gets covered with notes or I forget to look and really, it's still a pain because I've got vaules over here and goals over thee and I have to keep copying things back and forth ...  Anyway, I've decided to check out Franklin Covey's software. I have Outlook but being an Opera Fanatic - and specifically an M2 Fanatic, I'm not eager to haul the bloated beast that is Outlook. So FC is releasing a new set of tools for people who don't use Outlook. There's a 30 day trial and I'm already in love! This here is an attempt to use the PlanPlus Note taking system to back up my blogging. Hmmm - I note that there's no spell check ....  The beautiful part is that the goals tasks and missions are drag & droppable, they're right here! There's a whole section for planning your week and it starts at the Mision statement. Then it takes you to your goals - this is terrific - you can look over the steps of a goal and drag it into your week! It's so much easier to keep my priorites straight when the planning sessions automatically begins with the things I value most.  I'm dying to use this! I'm still going to check out the Outlook version but Franklin Covey has made a bigger fan out of me!

      It's eating my ribcage out to write this. I can feel that pull in lungs.  It's like glue dripping off my fingers. I don't want to write. This is pointless and boring and stupid. Why would I bother posting this.  History! It's fascinating to see an artist struggle and of course I use artist in the 'stupid wanker whining about his feelings' sense.  Is there value in doing this? Value in forcing myself to do it. It gets easier. I can remember when it was easy. Maybe I should set myself a word count. I've gone off the stream a bit. That's ok. It's easier to write maybe it's easier if I just type what I'm thinking and not try to write. I talk to myself constantly. Writing could just be typing down what I'm saying.   So what would I say about myself, in response to a question of why do you want to study here? Well first of course is that I love to study. I really miss being away from school. I still look forward to that first day when everything's new. So really I want to come and study here for the sake of studying.

      well it's been a disappointing week, all around. I managed to make myself ill worrying about the driving stuff. See I don't drive and I've developed a complex about it. I've tried learning but I always manage to ruin a car in the process. Last time I left the hand brake on while driving on the highway.  I've been looking into the blogging process. In truth, I'm rather ridiculously obsessed with it. I love TypePad but realistically, I'm going to aggravated by their wizard interface, I think.  I'd like to try Word Press down the road, or perhaps b2evolution. I'm excited at finding websites with such competitive pricing.  Also, I've been looking into CSS. I need to hone my skillz in that area in any event. I really couldn't switch to a personal site until I have better control over that.  In the meantime, I'm sticking with Blogger. I like it here. :)

      I'm not sure what's derailed my day more. My Mom's computer or my stupid sleeping schedule or the news that Bethesda Softworks is gig to develop Fallout 3.  My Mom's computer is just a vicious beast that taunts me to and snickers at the effect. I'm supposed to be the computer professional! I'm supposed to know what the fuck I'm doing. So why the fucking fuck does the game run THIS time that I clicked on the icons but ti didn't run the previous times? WHY? WHY!!! WHAT'S DIFFERENT????  Drive me right up the fucking wall.  Bethesda - I have mixed feelings. I think Fallout was one of the all time best games ever. Not as good Torment, mind you bet very very good indeed. Now Bethesda has made two of my personal favorite games of all times - Daggerfall and Morrowind. I love both of these games deeply and I think they have the most elaborate and detailed history and cosmology of any game ever made. Just leaves the Ultima games in the dust. But, I must admit, they aren't great games - not in the way that Fallout and Torment just grabbed the brass ring in their bloody teeth.  Also, Beth has never made a turn based game, to my knowledge, and I really do think a real-time Fallout will suck out loud. The combat in DF &  MW is really quite lame - a random wild clickfest. The tactical game in Fallout would go right out the window in a turn based scenario. OTOH, I can completely see Beth making a game that relies on charm and luck and intelligence to see it through. FO1 had a path that was completely non-combat. I can see Beth making a game like that and I think it would be dynamite.  Alright - lets see what else I can accomplish here.

      I'm blogging today because it says in my planner that today I blog.  I'm using a Franklin Covey Planner, Daily Classic size with the New Yorker Pages. Those are cool pages they have a mono-tone blue border with the New Yorker font (you'd know it if you saw it.) Everyday it gives a little cartoon - the cartoons have long been the most brilliant part of the magazine - and a funny little news item. The New Yorker has a name for these spots ... I forget it though. Andy White use to write them. That part I remember.  Franklin Covey markets their planners as tools to help focus on the important part of life. The Franklin in their name refers to Ben, who kept a little diary where he outlined his goals and plans.  It's not so much a journal or a calander, although it's that too. The point is that you use their tools to help focus on what you want to accomplish. They have a series of guides that lead to your writing a mission statement for your life. Then the daily and monthly planners help you keep those goals in focus while getting you through the daily chores of meetings and work and assignments and so on.  Personally, suffering as I do from severe depression, I find myself feeling overwhelmed by tasks so I procrastinate and think of it as 'too much.' The more you procrastinate, of course, the more there is to be done and the greater the mental burden.  So I've been using my Franklin as a way to keep track - I outline what I want to accomplish step-by-step and I can look and see for myself that I don't have to do EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW. My planner today says I need to pray, blog and schedule out next week. I've also chosen to clean my room and shower. (Believe me, for a person with depression this is like swimming the English channel, some days.)  Instead of feeling overwhelmed, I feel proud that I accomplished today's goals and confident that I can accomplish tomorrow's. It's a major turn-around in my mental process. Here's a link a link to Franklin Covey's site, just because I like to look there -   urlLink  http://www.franklincovey.com/

      I have lust in my heart for the Nokia 6630 Smart phone:   urlLink Nokia 6630   How can anyone resist this? It's adorable! It's slim and tiny. It holds an hour's worth of video. VIDEO!!! my current phone, the avant-garde 3650 is the spiritual predeccesor of this phone. It's a unique shape with a camera and odd phone number pad. The 3650 can record about 5 minutes of video.  This one's smaller (the 3650's main complaint is it's dial and it looks huge in photos, although it's not.) and eschews the odd design for standard number arrangement. Having held the 3650 while taking photos I can see that the shape of the 6630 with the roundish bottom has been designed for better stability.  The 3650 has mono sound but the 6630 will have stereo sound and headsets. It's got easily swappable memory chips so you can store mp3's or (I suspect) swap game cards similar to the function on the newest N-Gage QD (Nokia's gaming machine/phone.)  They aren't pushing the virtues of the 6630 as a game machine, unlike how they presented the 3650, but it's obvious that it has the features. It also has upgradeable memory chips. It's a series 60 phone with Symbian technology so it will play any of the game that run on the other series 60's. It's got the big video screen that the 3650 boasts - also the joystick.  It's got broadband access and the phone can be used as a broadband modem with wireless cards connecting it to your laptop. Also, you can connect with bluetooth. The camera looks like this -  1.3 megapixel camera sensor, effective resolution 1.23 megapixels for image capture (1280 x 960 pixel resolution)  and you can instantly print your photos.  I could go on about this phone for the next six months which is good because it will be at least that long until it's released.

      Man am I beat. I don't know what the deal is but I've been waking up at 3-4 every day. It's making me nuts. I can't get back to sleep.  Actually, that right there is the big issue. When I'm deeply tired I have to consciously relax my mod and mind. It's like prying my fingers off a ledge. And then when I wake up I'm not so tired any more (quite) and it's harder to let go. I've learned in the last year or so how to drift off if I'm deeply tired - the sleep medicine I take helps trigger the sleepiness - but I haven't really learned to fall asleep unless my body's just screaming for it. That's the next step I guess.
