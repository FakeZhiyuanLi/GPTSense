Its smaller              sibling, the DL300 can hold 12.5 terabytes natively or 37.5 with compression. Data transfer speeds rate at 80                   MB per second." (source: enterpriseitplanet.com)       4.)   IBM Seeks Knockout Blow in SCO Case   And, last but not least, my personal favorite story from today.               IBM has made a recent court filing that would force the SCO group to forceably show proof of copyright             infringement on their part.  SCO has yet to come up with sufficient evidence to convince...

         This is a test post for news.   Today's News comes from Google Tech News.       1)  The House makes a bill against P2P filesharing   That statement is at the heart of the war on file sharing, both of music and movies, and underpins    lawsuits against thousands of music fans, as well as legislation approved last week by a House Judiciary subcommittee that would create federal penalties ...       2)  More updates about Google's G-Mail   Google's new "G-Mail" service is making its debut soon offering up to 1 GB (1000 MB) of storage space.

       Just a little news preview for this summer... i decided to go ahead and just post one news update before May 28th...  And what do you know... I'll actually comment on each of the stories!  This news preview's news comes from Internet Week.com   1)   urlLink Lycos jumps into the 1GB email market  .  Wow... this is amazing... everybody's getting into "big" storage.  I think Google has everyone's attention, though... I might get a lycos account just for testing purposes ;-)  2)   Cisco leak .   More details about the computer code stolen from Cisco surfaced on Tuesday, including new samples of the source code and information on how the code was distributed, four days after a Russian Web site reported news of the theft and posted sample code ...  3)     urlLink IBM, Cisco Team Up For VoIP   .  VoIP (voice over IP).  This is kinda neat...

       Ok... sorry about the lack of News posting - I'm going to change the format for posting news headlines.  I'll start posting after I've read a lot of stories and when I have a commentary for each of them -- it will most likel *not* be every day, but rather two to three times a week.  I'll try to have one up today, though...

      I was having a conversation with my English professor this morning about my subject of The Open Source Movement for my Cause and Effect essay. She said" Thats the free one right?", like there was some one program for Open Source.   I proptly told her that Open Source was more the a couple of free programs. Its a community, a community that likes to have a choice. A choice to just to go with the "Commercial Engineered" program made by "professionals" that tells you what you can and cannot do, or make your own programs. Programs that you control, programs that actual do what there are supposed to do.  Plus you have a whole community of poeple deicated to a project, that anyone can do with whatever they want. I personally believe that no closed source operating system will be hole free because noone can see the code, and see if it really is as good as they say. And I would take the advice of 500,000 Plus, then the advice of 20 anyday!

      Well I stayed up again way past my bed time last night. I think I got to sleep about 3 this morning, then woke up about 7. The reason for this was that I went bowling last night. I went with one of my friends, but we didn't leave untill about 9. I haven't been bowling in awhile and trust me I bit really bad. But, the night wasn't totally lost, I ran into a really really good friend that I haven't saw in a long time. She used to leave beside me for about 2 years, but they moved to Rutherford, NC. We still see them maybe 3 of 4 times a year, but I just realized how much I miss them, and I think that I will try to make it at least a monthly thing to visit them.   Well I guess I better go, by the way  urlLink Justin  has a new website up.

      Well this is the last day of Call For Help, and I wish I could be there. I won't write a lot about this, just see my last post.    I am really amazed at the lack of sercurity people have for their computers and passwords. My cousin Rachel, the one with the xanga account, doesn't like to remember her password, so she lets Mozilla remember her password. Since she keeps telling me that she will block me if I kept leaving comments on her blog like "Blogger Rules" and giving links to my blog where I go on a rant about it, I decided that I would give her a little taste of what a lack of sercurity can do.   Last night at their house, I opened Mozilla and went to the Xanga website, and just as I though their was her login name and password already in the login box, but the password was in asterisk. How did you get her password then Nick? I got it super easily, All I did was copy the asterisks into the body of an unencrypted email, and sent it to myself. Well there you go, if you want to teach someone in you family a sercurity lesson. Well I really not that mean, because I will send her a email, with a link to the blog. So if I don't post for about a week, then she probably killed me.

      The beloved show Call For Help, had its last taping yesterday. The final show will air Friday at 6 p.m. Call for Help has been on the air since  urlLink TechTv was ZDTV , which is 6 year. Here is a quote from Leo Laporte's blog:      G4 is shopping the show and it's possible another network will pick it up. I pray someone does. I'll keep doing it if I have to fly to Sandusky twice a week. Somehow, somewhere, Call for Help has to live on, if only for the folks who have come to depend on the show for their computer help. I know so many moms and grandfathers and kids and just plain folks for whom Call for Help was an introduction to technology. The show helped get so many people on track, and I feel like we're letting many more down by not doing it any more. Cross your fingers that some network executive somewhere is willing to take a chance on a funky little show that makes such a big difference in people's lives.  I would like to thank, Leo Laporte, Cat Schwartz, Roger Chang, for the dedicated 6 years that they gave us. I will really miss it, and hopefully get to see everyone again. If I had a channel trust me I would pick it up in a heart beat.

      Man I am so tired. It all started yesterday when I got up at 3 am, and stupid me didn't go back to sleep. Anyway, about 9:30 last night one of my friends calls and ask if me and my cousin wanted to play some Halo, and like the true Halo fan I could pass up the opportunity to score a couple frags.   The best part was that I brought my xbox and a link cable, so that we could play on separate TV's. So there was five people playing:     Me: A Jedi   My Cousin: Antius   My Friend: Assault   His Brother: Shadow   His Uncle: Random  We played maybe 2 hours before his uncle left, and I was doing alright, but not winning that many matches. Then I pick my favorite level, Prisoner with Rockets, and I did the best I have ever done. At the very first of the game I got 2 double kills, and the first ever between us A TRIPLE KILL. Everyone felt so mad because of how bad they did we ended up playing 5 times, and this was the outcome: Me-4, and Antius-1.    On another note, I really hate Xanga. I really don't see why people use it when blogger avaible, here are some of the reason it sucks: Crappy Templates- the templates are all one color, and they are not even good colors. Have to Login to Blog- I never login to blogger, I use w.blogger. It sucks really badly when you have something to type, and then you have to login and go though about 3 more unnecessary screens to actually start typing. Eprops- what the heck, this is one of the stupidest things I ever saw. I mean how stupid is it to have a ranking system on your blog, Like I really care if I get a gold star for my blog. How Child-like. If you feel the same leave a comment. Let the hate mail come, if you can't find the link on this page it is  urlLink here  thats right I got a Gmail account.   Well I think that I am going to take a nap. I am falling asleep writing this.

      This is a qoute from Leo Laporte's blog:     Microsoft shills the Alexis de Toqueville Institution are try to spread a little FUD by claiming  urlLink Linus Torvalds didn't write Linux . Linus  urlLink admits it  - he says he was just covering for Santa and the Tooth Fairy. It's one thing to blame terrorism on Open Source, but this is really going too far.    This is going a little far in trying to stop Linux, trying to blame terrorism on Linux is the stupidest thing that I have ever heard of. Now Microsoft is trying to say that Linus didn't even write it, that is like saying that Windows Me was a good stable operating system. Well I guess I have another thing to add to my list of things why I hate Microsoft. By the way things are going I think I am going to have a book one of these days.

      Who here likes Xanga over Blogger? I know about 3 people that use it. I love blogger and think it is very cool. I think that Xanga is for people who are not very "tech savy", which is everyone I know except Justin. He is the only one I know that understands what I am talking about, and has the same opinion of things that I don't like. Like software the is very crappy and not free opposed to the free best software that I ever used.   I am thinking about starting a Daily Tech review and sending to people as email that they can't get ride of.   Also I really don't like the band called "The darkness", which are the gayest band in the world. Let the hate mail come...  I am starting a Online Petition for The Darkness

      I just saw the preview of  urlLink Halo 2  from the E3 Microsoft Conference, and it looks awesome. I can't wait to play it. Here are some of the new features: Dual weapons - This means you can run over a weapon and hit Y to pick it up in you off hand, and the two trigger buttons fired independantly. Destrutable levels - The levelsare more realitic this time around, when you shoot a boulder with a rocket launcher the blouder moves; also when vehicals take damage, you can tell a difference in the driving.   Sorry about the blog for all those you don't know what I am talking about.   On a more techy note I am currently downloading Knoppix, a bootable cd distrobution of Linux, for a relative.

      This sucks very badly !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is a qoute from Leo Laporte's blog: I've just learned that G4 has fired the entire staff of TechTV.  Per the WARN Act (governing plant closings) all the employees of TechTV have been given 60 days notice. The San Francisco operation will be shuttered by July. 100 of the existing jobs will be posted for those willing to relocate to LA.  Outgoing COO, Joe Gillespie will say good-bye to the troops tomorrow. Incoming CEO Charles Hirschorn will say hello (and good-bye) on Monday.  No word on which shows G4 will keep or which hosts will be kept on. End of Qoute   322 people have aready responded to leo's blog, I guess all the letters, emails, and calls to ComCast has made no difference.   I really really do not like Paul Allen (former owner of TechTv). I think he has ruined one of the best tv shows on the air today. Now I have another reason to HATE microsoft.   I will really miss everyone on Techtv, I know you will do good in whatever comes next.

      Me and  urlLink Justin  have got the Radio Station up, but there are some bugs to work out.  We are using Peer Cast, with WinAmp running as the DSP.  It is down right now, and we have some late nights ahead of us to get all the bugs work out.   Who would have though not even a couple years ago that two geeks will be running a Internet Radio station out of their bedrooms?

Any out there love their host provider? Then send me the link please.   P.S - I have finally settled on a domain name, which is the hardest part. I am not going to post it, just because I know people who have been sorry after they did. You will find out when i get a domain.

      When I started my computer up a very bad sound came from the CD-ROM drive. When Windows booted up I tryed to open it, but somehow Windows counldn't find my drive, the one that been in there for like 2 years. So I did what any long time user of Windows would do, I restarted. Of course it work fine, thank God. Anyone else out there have this probelm, hope it doesn't happen again.   VBS started tonight at my church, but its only for birth though sixth, but I am supposed to help do something, I don't know what yet. Hopefully something cool.   Don't forget that Spider Man 2 comes out this coming Wednesday, This is going to be a must see. Hopefully I can watch it a the Spartan 16, the same place I saw Day After Tomorrow, which is also a very good movie.

      Lately I find mind drifting back to the good ole days, which were maybe a year and 6 months ago. Where things didn't have such a bleak outcome as they seem of having today, and I find myself looking back and missing the time spent infront of the tube watching  urlLink Leo  twice a day. I miss watching Call for Help before it was pre-recorded, but I would settle for that then no CFH at all, sob sob. I miss watching The Screen Saver where you knew that in every episode that you were going to end up laughing your butt off, but also somehow learning in the process (I never got how they did that). I miss watching new episodes of X-Play, with the super funny Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb, I extremely dislike people who can only see beauty in a person, and not anything else (even though of current circurmstances, *cough maxim *cough, which might I add wouldn't of happen if things had continued in the good ole days way.)   But I tell myself that you can't always live in the past, you have to look to the future, no matter how bleak it seems.

      I went on quickest planed vacation ever. It took us 30 minutes to say we were going to go, to actually leaving. I went with my aunt and uncle, and my cousins, and a friend.   It took us about 2 hours to get there, and we walk around Gatlinburg for about 3 hour after getting there, even though it rained most of the time. It still was the best time I have had in a while.

We are going to be Co-Admins of a site that we are working on, and also we are going to combine are message boards to make one big community of geeks for geeks.   This will not take place for so time, probably in December. We are going to try to advertise on as many website, and search engines as humanly possible. To all that reads this post, I will really hope that you going mine or his message boards, and will help any way possible with the community to come.

I really like it, mostly because you have a bunch of different skills you can learn. So everybody don't have to be the same. Plus it is really fun to have a bunch of people to help you.

      A good friend has fell in love, in love with IE2. He says its ten times better then FireFox, but I have to disagree. I can't even get my IE to stay stable enoungh to open 3 web pages, plus the lack of SSL, which is an open source project called "Secure Socket Layers". FireFox uses v2.0 and v3.0 of this application, plus the use TSL, which add to the sercurity of FireFox.   I will not be changing over browsers.   On another note Rachel, the one going to Mexico, left this morning. But we had a fun night together watching Scary Movie 3, which is a whole lot better then the first 2, but still has some questionable parts.   If you haven't noticed, I have a new link on my blog to  urlLink Jessi Elder . She is my other cousin, the sister of  urlLink Rachel . She hasn't been blogging long, and just like Rachel she has made the mistake of using Xanga. So if you read her blog be nice.

      Well its not so much a pain as it is a soreness, but that is what I get for laying out of the gym for 3 weeks. I can't do anything that I could before, and my legs really really hurt just to walk on them. Hopefully they will be better tomorrow, but then we have to do legs again tomorrow which really sucks.   On another note my cousin Rachel is leave for 1 whole month, wow. She is going down to Mexico to help some of her friends with a mission project, which is really really cool of her. I ask you to pray for her, and her mother. I know we will all miss her, but I also know its for a good cause.

      I am sorry for the lack of post this past week, I have been really busy and didn't really find the time to make a blog, but I finally have the time so heres the past week of events.   I started back going to the gym on Tuesday, and later that night happened to stay up until about 4 for another Halo Lan party. I saw The day after tomorrow in a new theater in Spartan, SC, called the Spartan 16, which has 16 different theaters which is really really cool.   I found out today that me friend Justin got the Sasser worm, which really sucks, I hope everyone has a good week.   Here is another rant about Xanga:  I really don't see why peope use it, I can't even get my template to work. See I am not a go by the book kind of person, I want to customize everything to look different then everyone elses, but I don't see why xanga won't let me do this, I guess they are to lazy to code something that actually works properly.

      This is one of the funniest Political jabs that I have saw and a long time, but sadly JibJab is being sued for it, talk about a violation of the first admendment.  Here is the article: When was the last time you saw John Kerry on his knees before world leaders, clad in S&amp;M gear and with a ball gag in his mouth? Or eyed President Bush looking sheepish in a red dunce cap?  Chances are it was sometime this past week on national TV and maybe 10 times before that on the Internet, thanks to JibJab, a site that is posting animators Evan and Gregg Spiridellis' latest creation, This Land.  The film features Kerry and Bush dissing each other like boys on a playground to the tune of Woody Guthrie's classic song, "This Land Is Your Land." It's made it around the world, with enthusiastic viewers commenting about the film on the site's blog from as far away as the Netherlands, New Zealand and Guam, and its historical value has been noted by the Library of Congress, which on Tuesday e-mailed the Santa Monica, California-based Spiridellises asking to add the animated short to its archives.  But while about 25 million viewers have been clogging JibJab to chuckle at the film's South Park-like Flash animation and juvenile insults (Bush labels Kerry a "liberal sissy," and Kerry responds by calling Bush a "right-wing nut job"), the Spiridellises aren't exactly laughing their way back to the drawing board.  In the wake of their short's popularity, which began soon after its July 9 Web release and has been punctuated by appearances and mentions on almost every major U.S. news show, the brothers found themselves in a legal skirmish with Ludlow Music, which, Ludlow attorney Paul LiCalsi said, owns the copyright to Guthrie's famous tune.  Ludlow Music is a unit of music publisher The Richmond Organization. JibJab Media, the proper name of the Spiridellises' company, never got permission to use Guthrie's song in This Land, and Ludlow Music is telling them to pull down the short.  About a week ago, the brothers were served with a cease-and-desist order on behalf of Ludlow Music, demanding they remove This Land from their website. LiCalsi said Ludlow has not filed a lawsuit yet against JibJab and hopes to resolve the case without taking that step.  urlLink More

      I loved this song before Shine Down redid it, but now I think I like it more. I just a good song, one of the classics.  Sometimes I just want to be a Simple Man, with nothing to worry about, and just me and my trusty friend the Internet. Here is the lyrics for those who haven't head it.   Simple Man By: Lynyrd Skynyrd   Mama told me when I was young Come sit beside me, my only son And listen closely to what I say. And if you do this It will help you some sunny day. Take your time... don’t live too fast, Troubles will come and they will pass. Go find a woman and you’ll find love, And don’t forget son, There is someone up above.  (chorus) And be a simple kind of man. Be something you love and understand. Be a simple kind of man. Won’t you do this for me son, If you can?  Forget your lust for the rich man’s gold All that you need is in your soul, And you can do this if you try. All that I want for you my son, Is to be satisfied.  (chorus)  Boy, don’t you worry... you’ll find yourself. Follow you heart and nothing else. And you can do this if you try. All I want for you my son, Is to be satisfied.  (chorus)

      I finally get to read this book, and it a pretty good book for those not reading it from a religous aspect. Its about how Davinci was part of the secret society called the "Prion of Sion", and about how the are protecting the secrets of the Holy Grail, but the four top members get murder.     This is all I am going to say about, if you want to know more read the book or email me.  P.S. - its kinda hard to explain.     _____________________________________________________________________    I found this sometime ago from Kevin Rose the Co-Host of TSS. It has abunch of Windows viruses, a lot of them. It should make a hacker job a lot more fun. Well  urlLink here  you go.     I think I did my daily evil deed.

      I have been wanting to do this for a while now, and I have notice it hasn't been done before.  So me and my good friend  urlLink Justin  are going to start the long and tiring journey of The Communist..uh I mean The Geek Manifesto.     I believe we are going to do it like this: Justin is going to start to write a novel, which I believe is the biggest task know to man, and I am going to start with what I believe to be a profile of a geek. This isn't going to be on of those "Find out How Geeky You Are" things this is just going to be a profile of me and a couple other people on what makes a geek. If you have any question or suggestion feel free to email me.     urlLink    Any TechTv fan I thought you might enjoy this, I I did.

      I have a new favorite site,  urlLink GeekStreak  its a pretty funny site. The guy who runs this is a pretty active member on  urlLink Leoville , his ID is LordKat.  We went into town today for the 4th celebation, and it blew. It was really small, smaller then all the years before. We are going back over their about 8:30 to see the fireworks, which should be good.   I have 3 more gmail invites left to give, if anyone wants one just leave a comment. First 3 to comment gets them, NO EXCEPTION

      I went and saw Spider-man 2 last night, and I have to say that it was a very very good movie. It was really well done, and I would go see it again. I went to the new theater in Spartanburg, SC called "Spartan 16" which is the same one in which I saw "The Day after Tomorrow". If you were worried about spending your money to see this movie, then don't it was well worth it for me.

      Well I haven't done much the past couple of days, I saw Hidalgo its was an ok movie. Some parts was cool. The most funny part at the movie was the manager at blockbuster, we were about to check out and he asked if I knew what other movie that guy played in he couldn't remember. LOL. For all that don't know the main character of Hidalgo is Aragon of the LOTR, one of the bestvmovies ever made, and the manager of blockbuster didn't know who he was.  Also, I went over to a friend house last night and play the guitar with him, and like usual ended up playing Halo for a couple of hours(more like 4). Well that all.

      Well I went and saw The Village last night and I was pretty good, If you like any of M. Night Shamylan's other movies you will like this one. I want give away anything, but after you see this you will have differnet view of society.  He is a pretty good director, and all his other movies are: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs.  All really good movies.
