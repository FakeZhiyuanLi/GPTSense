      i'm sure, now that i think of it , that your family was just looking for a reason to goad me.  seeing as how they've never ever liked me and now look what i've done and all.  and that's fine.  that's fine.  fuck that.  i don't know if you will read the rest of this email, because that paragraph i just typed is about as rational and levelheaded as i can be.  what's left is discombobulated angry mess.  it's all raw and terrible and you don't deserve it, i guess.  but it goes like this:  you can be such a pathetic, manipulative, vindictive, snide bitch, ____.  when i think of you i try to imagine how you were ever soft or sweet or good, because what's left is bitter and ridiculous and base.  you say you loved me, but you never fucking did.  you wanted some great girl goddess #9 to sweep into your little closeted life and find your cunt and make you alive.  so i did.  you wanted some sick mothering figure to tell you it was okay to act like a 5 year old and chase away your bad dreams and loveyouloveyouloveyou no matter what.  so i did.  you wanted to know what sex was.  so i showed you.  you wanted to kiss a girl.  so i kissed you.  you wanted it to be hot.  so it was.  you wanted to make love with some fantasy of a soft sensuous heifer.  you wanted my voice and my bluegrass songs.  you wanted my childhood.  i gave you these things.  you wanted to give me everything.  so i let you.  you wanted to validate yourself in a relationship and prove your sexuality.  you wanted to explore me and use my love as an inspiration for every other experience in your life.  so you did.  you wanted my chubby hands and my nose and my red hair and my cat and my sleep noises and my rainbows and my smile and my style and my dreams, ____.  i gave you everything i could.  you turned every fucking thing around until it was about you.  you made every situation a testament to your neediness, jealousy, or insecurity and i tolerated it.  i indulged you.  i did my best to put your fears to rest and keep your insecurities at bay because i wanted to care about you and i wanted you to have what you needed.  i let you pretend we were different people so that you could be okay, ____.  i made myself a different person.  i tried to help you be a different person.  fuck you.  fuck that, you are not a different person.  i am not a different person.  and this is the part where it really gets messy.  this is the truth that you already know that you nevernevernever wanted to see and i didn't want to show you.  why?  because we always thought it could be different.  i kept waiting for you to show me that moment, that glimmer that would prove to me that our relationship was worth the sacrifice and the compromise.  the moment in which we could be ourselves and actually understand each other.  the moment that i would stop regretting my choice, when we could be real.  i pushed us toward that moment but you always pulled back and it never happened, and it never could have happened.  the great big obvious truth is that we never should have been.  fundamentally.  i mean in that great philisophical way that all things happen for a reason and that we learn from all things, it was all fine and well that we wasted 3.5 years of each other's lives.  but actually.  really, truly, we never should have been together.  and in fleeting moments i miss you so strongly.  i don't know what i miss, any more than you know why you can't stop thinking about me when i obviously hurt you to your very core.  it's proof that we made a connection.  that's all.  it's moments of comfortability in which you think it's okay because there's a warm body or song to sing or a trip to take.  you think it's okay because you make plans or you spend money or you move around the fucking country chasing after ideas that you can only hope will finally come to be realities.  you think it's okay because there's nothing immediately better.  you think it's okay because you want it to be okay.  because you want it to be easy.  you think it's okay because you can cum.  or because you cook.  or because full house is on.  but nothing ever made it okay for very long, did it, hon?  even in those silly happy wonderful roadtrip sex-in-a-thunderstorm let'sorderpizza idroveallnight ofcoursei'llmovetosouthcarolina loverstobed littlesnack chiquitabanana moments there was a darkness.  here, you will think that darkness was ________.  you will think i could never be happy with you because of my feelings for him.  you think that because i thought of him, called him, missed him, visited him, wrote him, and eventually showered with him, laid naked with him, and "SUCKED HIS DICK" that i could never be happy with you.  but that's not it.  it wasn't because of him.  it was because of us.  so it was a great big fucking waste of fucking precious time.  yours and mine.  and all the fucking cocksucking i could ever do would never be as terrible a thing as you lying to yourself about who you are, as terrible as you pretending to be happy, as you suckerpunching our relationship with your detestable manipulations and fucking headtrips.  and what's ultimately terrible, the most terrible thing of all is that now you think it was me.  you think my untruthfullness brought this sad relationship to its tumultuous end.  you think that my lips on his penis erased so many false words falling from your own lips, that my secret private thoughts of him were more sordid than your secret private thoughts of other women, unrealized even to yourself because you're not strong enough to know who the hell you are.  i knew.  i loved you anyway.  it didn't matter who you wanted to fuck or what you might have thought about other people.  it's a shame that you never took advantage of my open-mindedness or acceptance.  it's a shame that you only milked me for your specific needs and demanded that i keep myself as sheltered and as blinded as you were.  it's ridiculous that you should have asked me to lie to myself just like you and deny who i am just so that i could be with you.  just because you were already there.  it's offensive that you think my bisexuality is a big fucking cruel joke and that i just like to throw it around to make you feel bad about being gay.  that i'm a slut who would fuck just about anyone of any sex for any reason at any time.  beacuse i'm like that.  i gave you moments of my life that meant something.  i could never trust you with the moments that meant everything.  that's not my fault.  you left me once and you took it back.  there were feelings of relief that i was afraid of.  what did it mean that i was almost glad you didn't want to be with me anymore?  what did it mean that you got drunk on the beach and suddenly realized that this was the most ridiculous summerville situation of our lives?  why, then, did you want so desperately to revoke those words?  why did i let you?  you left me once and you took it back.  you left me twice and i'll never see you again. it is with respect for all of the suffering we have caused each other, and all of the precious moments we can no longer trust that i say "...finally".
