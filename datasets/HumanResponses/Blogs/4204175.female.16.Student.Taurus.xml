      Loneliness is...  Cold like wet sand Moulding under your feet As blue as the serene ocean Calm currents stirring silently in the vacant night It moves like a snail Sliding across the misty boardwalk where life once used to play It feels like the firm grasp of air It's always there But never close enough It smells like dry salt As the Echoing winds sound all over It looks like an empty bottle buried at the end of the ocean It taste like poison You swallow it And slowly start to crawl to your corner And want to die Then you realize your werenâ€™t alone  You just went unnoticed  Loneliness is...

      Today was aryt, i woke up to the sound of heavy rain. I heard ova the radio bout this 10 year old kid from the limpopo province whos private parts were used for muti and was murdered(muti is like a type of medicine u get from a witchdoctor. its used on people u hate or sometimes simply to get somebody to fall in love with u, although u can use it for many things). Thats just gross, and they were reports about two women who escaped being used for muti. Apparently if u use muti made from a child combined with drugs u get a really good effect... I dont know wat this country is coming to... i mean u hear about these things bt using a 10 year old kid( its just sick using another person's body parts)... i cant believe people can get so desparate for something that they will use a person's private parts to gain what they want. Thats really disgusting!!!

      some asshole foned today and says i'd won a car I'm like what car?, i'm not expecting any prizes or things like that. he said i had been picked by somebody who works for his company(oh and this guy is an afrikaaner, u know the ones with really bad accents so we spoke in afrikaans). Anyways he gives me an address(somewhere in Table View) and tells me to come to his place to claim my price at 9pm...Why the hell do u want to go to a person's house at 9pm?(a person u've neva eva met or spoken to) So i tell him, i cant make it, i'm busy i didnt plan on it... He then keeps on tlking shit. So i said, "i thought your company was sponsering this thing, so why do i need to come to ur place? Why cant i jst meet u at your work place or something?" He says... they had been trying to get in touch with me and when they couldnt, they had decided to let him keep on trying and call me later to get the car. (this is probably the lamest excuse eva!!!) After hearing this i just simply laughed and hung up the phone. A minute later he fones again saying, "why did u cut me off? Do u know how rude that is?" So then i said, "look i dont know who the fuck u are or wat u want so just leave me the hell alone!" This guy is a serious freak so he says "srry, i'm really srry i bothered you, plz forgive me!!!" I'm like wateva FUCKFACE!!! And i put the fone down on him, luckily he didnt fone back

      Sometimes I wonder why I'm alive, And how my fears won't pass me by, I cry when I can't have faith in myself, Asking my soul to release my inner self  I was born into this world as a sinner, If I ever lose I'm still a winner, Take a good look at me sometimes, You will find out why  I have pain in my heart, Can't play the part, Of a person I'm not, There are alot  Of things people just don't understand about me, Can't even walk or breathe, Without someone judging me, Because I am just me  This world is full of hate, Something we can't replace, So ask yourself the question "Do you want to live or die", Cause our world is in everyone's eyes
