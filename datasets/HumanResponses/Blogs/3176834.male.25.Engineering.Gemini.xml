       1. Where has Reva been launched? The Reva Electric car was launched in June 2001 in Bangalore and is currently available in a many cities across the country.    2. Has Reva been exported? Yes, Reva Electric cars have been exported to Nepal, Malta, Hong Kong, Switzerland and China. Keeping in mind that the cost of a Reva is approximately one-third the price of a similar Electric Vehicle in Europe / UK / USA - there is a great appreciation for this car in the international market. Agreements / MOU`s have been signed for UK, Japan, Israel and Norway.  We are having serious discussions with people in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and other South East Asian countries. Reva cars are also currently being tested in the UK & (Other) markets.   3. What is the seating capacity of Reva? Reva is a two-door hatchback, which can comfortably accommodate two adults and two minors.  4. What are the colours that are available for the Reva? Reva is available in over 2000 exciting colours to suit your personality and style. This is in addition to our standard production colours – Cherry Red, Blue Envy, Passion Yellow, Angel White, Autumn Rust, Nature Green. The REVA Classe is also available in Black Velvet colour   5. How economical is Reva? The Reva uses 9 units of electricity for a single full charge that gives 80 KM range in city driving conditions. This works out to less than 1 US cent per KM. Since the Reva does not have an engine, clutch or gears, or a carburetor, radiator, exhaust etc, the maintenance cost is low. Estimates show it is 40 % lower than the maintenance cost of a small car over a 3-year ownership period.   6. How far can Reva go on one single Charge? Reva will take you a full 80-KM on a single charge. There is a battery level indicator light which comes on when there is 15 KM of charge remaining flashes when there is 5 km remaining, and the onboard computer automatically shifts the car into an " E " or economy mode, which enhances your driving range by another 5 KM.  7. What type of batteries is used in the Reva? What is their life span?  A total of eight 6-volt tubular lead acid batteries specially developed for EV`s form Reva's power pack. The battery pack has a typical life of 3 - 5 years depending upon usage. It comes with a warranty of cycle 40,000 KM / 3 years.  8. What if I need to recharge the battery? Reva’s charging system is extremely simple, very reliable and safe. It has an on- board charger along with a charge cable and can be charged anywhere, at home or at work, by simply plugging in to a 220 Volt, 15 Ampere socket. There is no need to carry an additional battery. Charging the Reva is as easy as charging your mobile phone.  9. What percentage of components in the Reva is indigenous? The Reva has about 1100 components of which over 90% of the components are indigenous.  10. How safe is the Reva? It is an extremely safe car. It has passed all mandatory safety tests. It has been specifically designed for the city – accidents which normally are from the side or front / rear. Overall / Side impact - The special steel space frame and side impact beams used in the Reva cocoons the passengers shielding them from impact. Reva uses ABS body panels that are dent / scratch proof. This ensures minimum damage to the car and enhances protection to passengers in the event of a collision. Front / Back impact -. Injury to passengers is also minimized in the event of a frontal collision due to the position of the spare tyre in the bonnet space where other cars usually have the engine. The front and rear bumpers are energy absorbing and retain their original shape after a minor impact. The weight and position of the battery pack under the front seat ensures a low centre of gravity / stability.  11. What kind of testing have you done? The Reva has already been tested at ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India), Pune and has been passed for homologation and roadworthiness. Tests at ARAI cover all mandatory parameters. The Reva has also cleared the shaker test, which simulates 250,000 KM of road testing. In addition, Reva has completed 10,00,000 KM of extensive road tests to ensure total safety and reliability before the first car reached the customer.  12. Where are the Reva dealers / service network located? The Reva dealer and service network is in operation in Bangalore and other markets in Karnataka, Goa, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, with other cities / states under finalization. Our plan is to ensure the best sales / service and ownership experience for Reva customers.   13.&nbsp; What about the availability of spares? With high degree of localized components in Reva availability of spares is not a problem. Usually replacement parts in a car consists of Spark plugs, belts, clutch plate, engine parts, exhaust etc. Reva does not have any one of them. Most of the parts in REVA are highly reliable and do not need a change for a long time. Brushes and brake components are amongst the major parts needing replacement after a long time.  Of course in the case of an accident, parts will have to be replaced. Stocks of spares of Reva are sufficiently available at all our dealer points / service stations. Since the Reva has been launched with a very high degree of local components, there is no difficulty in the availability of spares at a reasonable cost.   14. What is regenerative braking?  Regenerative braking recovers useful electricity by putting it back into the batteries. Regenerative braking lets the motor act as a generator, converting the vehicle's momentum into electricity. So, when you take your foot off the accelerator or press the brake, the motor becomes a generator, slowing the car and returning energy to the battery. Since it takes energy to make energy, the vehicle's momentum is consumed and the vehicle slows. The immediate benefit of this process is that it simulates the compression braking (slowdown effect) feature of gas engines, reducing the brake wear normal to most cars. Energy spent climbing uphill is recovered on the way down, rather than wasted burning up brakes! In Reva, regenerative braking makes driving in stop-and-go rush hour traffic smooth and effortless.

       The new generation 'Green' engine from Hyundai is set to revolutionalise the diesel car segment Hyundai's Fuel Cell Powered Santa Fe strikes gold   October 10, 2002, witnessed the launch of a new generation diesel variant of Accent from Hyundai Motor India Limited. This new 'Common Rail Direct Injection' diesel engine from Hyundai combines the performance and handling of a petrol engine with the fuel efficiency of a diesel.   Developed by Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea, in association with Detroit Diesel, USA, this new engine does away with high noise, vibrations, poor drive quality and particle pollutants- all common problems associated with conventional diesel engines.   Working on a patented 'direct injection' technology, the CRDi engine has 'rails' that inject pressurised fuel directly into the engine thereby improving engine efficiency and reducing noise and vibrations. The CRDi also electronically controls engine pressure, fuel quantity and injection timing to deliver better fuel efficiency and lower Nox and particulate emissions, making it one of the most environment friendly diesels in its class.       Operates at very high pressures (1,300 bar)     Highly atomized fuel → efficient fuel-air mixing → higher engine efficiency     Reduced Nox emissions     Common Rail helps maintain high pressure at all times → high and constant injection pressure     Electronically controlled fuel timing and metering of fuel quantity → optimum fuel-air ratio → High fuel economy     Lower engine noise     &nbsp;

       With a conventional mechanical transmission gear shifts require an interruption of the connection between engine and gearbox which not only harms the comfort and the performances of the vehicle, but also represents a loss of kinetic energy. A shift under load, without disruption of the torque transmission is thus desirable. This is commonly performed by automatic transmissions composed of a hydrodynamic torque converter associated to planetary gear trains. But these automatic transmissions are complex, expensive and their efficiency remains lower than that of manual mechanical gearboxes. The simple and effective twin clutch concept invented by a brilliant French engineer before WW II has at last been developed and its mass production launched by VW and Audi. The competitors certainly do not intend to be left behind…   The new Octavia offers the truly revolutionary DSG technology (Direct Shift Gearbox) which combines the foremost benefits of a manual gearbox with the advantages of a traditional automatic transmission. The result is a smooth yet dynamic acceleration while providing excellent economy. Moreover you can choose between an automatic or manual Tiptronic versions. However, you won't be able to appreciate it, unless you try out the new Octavia for yourself.

       Ferrari has announced the official name for its all-new 2+2 model – the 612 Scaglietti, which goes on sale next summer. Named after famous Ferrari coachbuilder Sergio Scaglietti, the 4.9-metre long, all-aluminium 612 will blend the perfect combination of performance and comfort in the best traditions of a true Ferrari berlinetta designed to accommodate four people in high-speed luxury and safety.   For the first time, Ferrari will manufacture a 12-cylinder model with both the space-frame chassis and body panels in aluminium, built entirely in-house at Modena, Northern Italy, in the dedicated Scaglietti light-alloy technologies facility. The benefits of this construction method include a 60% increase in structural rigidity and significant weight savings of 60 kg compared to the current 456M GTA – despite the new car’s larger dimensions.   The overall layout – engine mounted behind the front axle, gearbox in unit with the differential at the rear – ensures an ideally balanced weight distribution (46% front, 54% rear), as well as permitting a lower centre of gravity, which benefits the dynamic behaviour of the car. The performance-orientated handling is enhanced by active damping and a new stability and traction control system, making its first-ever appearance on a Ferrari. The 612 will run on 18 inch diameter front wheels with 245/45 tyres and 19 inch rear wheels with 285/40 tyres.   The 612’s 5748 cc, 12-cylinder, 48-valve, 65°V engine is a product of the most advanced Ferrari technology. The all-aluminium power unit has a compression ratio of 11.2:1 and generates a maximum output of 540 bhp at 7,250 rpm, with 434 lb ft (588 Nm) of torque at 5,250 rpm. The new car is expected to accelerate from standstill to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 4.2 seconds, and to achieve a top speed of 196 mph (315 km/h).   All 612 models will be fitted with a six-speed mechanical gearbox, with a choice of manual, and F1-style paddle shifts. Newly developed for the 612, the electro-hydraulic system is known as the F1A. It is designed to deliver both fast and ultra-smooth gear changes.   Designed by Pininfarina to epitomise dynamism and elegance, the 612 brings the name of Sergio Scaglietti back into public awareness. Scaglietti is the coachbuilder who brought to life some of the most beautiful Ferrari models in the 1950s and 60s. The new 612 features scalloped sides that recall the famous 375 MM he created for Italian film director Roberto Rossellini as a gift to his then-wife movie-star, Ingrid Bergman.   With a significantly longer wheelbase than the 456M, the 612 has been designed to offer ease of entry for rear-seat passengers to an outstandingly luxurious cabin which will accommodate four adults in comfort. On-board comfort is boosted for the driver – by the adoption of ‘new generation’ ergonomics for the instrument binnacle, steering-wheel mounted and fascia-mounted controls – and for passengers by the fitting of dual-zone climate control and a Hi-End Bose sound system, specifically tailored to suit the unique acoustics of the leather and aluminium trimmed interior.   The capacity of the luggage compartment has been enlarged to 240-litres – 25% bigger than the 456M – and will hold a five-piece Ferrari luggage set or two full sets of golf clubs. The new 612 model is 139 mm longer, 37 mm wider, and 44 mm taller than the 456M, with the wheelbase increased by 350 mm to ensure the latest Ferrari is a genuine 2+2 four seater.   First deliveries of the 612 Scaglietti in Europe are scheduled for March 2004. Prices will be announced later this year.

       Hi folks! It's a small but enthusiastic effort to gather information about CARS from across web or various resources and club it together at one place. I know it's a next to impossible task but the idea is to atleast set the ignition and change gears as and when required.&nbsp;Most of the information will be gathered from trustful sources. The feedbacks, personal experiences and criticism from car lovers across the world will add spice to this site. I hope you will appreciate the effort. I am not a writer so spare me for my bland English.   Here's some information about me. I am a software engineer by profession. Work with a billion dollar company but it suck. Its just for money honey...I have done computer engineering so technically cannot enter into Automobile Domain right away. But still I have decided to build this site up so that my interest can be channelised and I can connect with people (known/unknown) sharing the same passion.

       While it is still unofficial, the dates are more or less firmed up. Market sources have it that Toyota will launch its new IMV (international and innovative multi-utility vehicle) on Indian roads in January 2005.   urlLink   But first, it is likely to unveiled before the Thai market towards September-October this year. The all-new vehicle will be taken to the ARAI, Pune for homologation in the second half of this year. It will be powered possibly both by CRDi diesel and petrol engines. Sources say the suspension system for the new vehicle is being currently tested on Indian roads on all-weather conditions on the Kijang, an older MUV. The Toyota will look at making the engines compliant with both Euro II and III emission norms since vehicles in India will be switching to a higher gear from April 2005. While the metros and major cities will graduate to Euro III emission norms and by that understanding to a higher quality of fuel, the rest of India will move up from Euro I to II norms. The engines will basically be designed to be sturdier and tuned up to deal with both fuel types. In fact absence of Euro III compatible fuel has prompted many car makers to postpone some new cars launches because their engines will not perform to the desired level, and will even suffer higher wear and tear. Market sources say the IMV Project is aimed at greatly enhancing Toyota’s competitiveness by optimising its worldwide development, procurement and production activities through orderly and efficient tie-ups among production bases outside Japan. Key to the network is the supply of various systems and major components between Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam and India. While this new structure will increase the degree to which Toyota’s production facilities in the Asia region mutually complement one another, it will also establish it as an important international supply base. Toyota production facilities in Thailand, for example, will fill the role of global supplier for pick-ups, MUVs and diesel engines. Annual pick-up and multipurpose vehicle production in Thailand will be expanded to 200,000 units, half of which will be earmarked for export to more than 80 countries and territories within and beyond Asean. Toyota will increase diesel engine production in Thailand to 240,000 units a year and expects to annually export 130,000 units. India is being made the base for production of manual transmission systems for various Toyota vehicles. The Rs 480-crore facility (at two locations) will have the capability to produce 168,000 units per annum. The rollout will begin this June. Meanwhile, even Rav-4 and the new Prado are tipped for a third quarter launch in India this year.
