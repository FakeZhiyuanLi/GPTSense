      omg! what a crazy day! well the craziness started friday night when i talked to 5 people i haven't talked to in a long time...it was just a little bit confusing. Band camp day 3, was not quite as fun as day 1 n 2, but was alright. i hurt my ankle early in on the day and soo the rest of the day was kind of sucky, plus one of my good friends was having a horribly sucky day bc of a certain guy. guys you just confuse the heck out of us. you know that? oh well youre tons of fun too! lol anyways..today was underwear/bra shopping day! i love this day..actually i just love shopping! but after about a million errands and buying panties, bras, socks, a tennis racket, and gas for the car we went home. Later on in the night when i was chatting away on the phone i got a call from one of my older sisters, becca, and she was crying saying she was going to the e.r. so of course i was freaking out. she ended up cutting her hand on some glass that broke when she was at work and her hand wouldnt stop bleeding. when i looked at it when i got to the e.r. it looked like a chunk of skin was missing! you could see the little white balls of fat..i almost fainted. anyways she got 6 stitches and we headed home. after that we started a bonfire in our backyard..i love the smell of firesmoke. well that was my crazy day..until another blog post..xoxoxo

      hAPPY bIRTHDAY sarah wright and melissa skaff! they finally turn 15.lol today was crazy. band camp day 2. Hilary (our instructor) was there, and made things a ton better. we get alot more work done and still have fun doing it. I love this years show, bc it has more cg than usual and our work is awesome. supper we went out to HyVee for the birthday girls and it was alot of us. first we started with just the two sarahs, then picked up melissa and rosy and supposed to be cole. but not cole bc hes a jerk. (i dont even know him but i've heard enough about it..sorry melissa!) then we met up with kayla schaeffer and boy ben c., mary n em, and then 2 other guys i didnt know names of. Sarah westerman and I went and bought a big package of cookie dough and split it out and gave to the birthday girls. then we sang a horribly tuned happy birthday and made them laugh. Drill was fun after supper again, GREEN FLAGS KICK ASH! lol we get to be the frames and were all excited. well im really tired because last night i got barely any sleep, but im ready for the weekend.

      hello to everyone out there- this is my first blog post! yay! today(wednesday...although it is thursay right now) was a LONG day. lets see here... FIRST DAY OF BAND CAMP was interesting enough. sarah and i got there a little early to see who all wanted to get some homecoming outfits. miss. mary katherine (what a cute girl) had gotten about 5 more ppl to join which is great! i can't wait to get the t-shirts and to see all 23 of us in them! after the first long hours of drill and basics colorguard got split from the marching band (sarah WRIGHT..) and the drumline (oh we were all devastated) went in the gym and were joined by mr. macklin. we had a nice little group discussion that lasted an hour 1/2 about how cg needs to be more positive and no more quitting. after that we had 20 mins until break so we sat in a circle and each said our name & if we had a loving other . it was quite fun. i did not know that elise jahr was going out with a guy name justin! supper time was fun when sarah westerman, sarah wright, mary and emily anderson all squeezed into my lil convert. and cruized down to the mall to eat a delightful meal. it was all fun and good and full of gossip! lol after dinner we had a couple more LONG hours full of band camp drill..which was interesting enough with jessica being paranoid about a guy staring at her, and lil stoner and i were singin and dancing. Around 9:30 i finally got home, and then about 15 mins later sarah westerman and her sweet older sister picked me up. we then went driving over to Thunder Road and met up with fun Emily Graff. And then met up with the rest of sarahs church group(dave, alex and his cute friend) and went gocarting around for atleast 2 1/2 hours. SUCH A BLAST! at first i was whooping everyone..and then everyone starting hittin me and i had a million collisions that the workers there started to call me by name. oh and we also saw our long lost sisters meri and jamie there with there church. i miss them so much! the live in canistota so we barely get to see them. it was fun..well i better go to sleep now, another day of band camp ahead of me!

      wow! its been awhile..i think were up to like camp day 7 or something. today and yesterday kicked ass! were finally getting drill and laura steffen, alyssa floyd and amanda g. were so energetic it was hilarious. we all got split up in the gym for goofing around too much but then i was next to gorgeous jessica westra. we then discussed her wedding plans, in hawaii, and i'm a bridesmaid. lol inside joke..shes not really gettin married altho she IS in a serious relationship with mysterious cameron. hmm.. for lunch today we went to kaylas boy ben chambers. it was so freaky because he moved into the house my best friend lived in back in fourth grade. she moved away and he moved in. its like it was fate for us to be friends.lol we also hauled melissas crazy bike, sarah wright and sarah westerman and me in my convertible and cruized to melissas house. it was crazy cool fun but dangerous. (do not try alone..not enough room AT ALL!) oh and before i go..drumline is soo fine. "drums turn me on..thats what gets me in trouble" lol alyssa and laura! well i better get packing..going to denver saturday and i still gotta email jordan.
