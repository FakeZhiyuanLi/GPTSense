I really worry about the people that I care about...sometimes too much. ^^;; blah.  But yeah..I got a lovely sight yesterday talking to my friend pete online...x.x god...I swear, I'll just need someone to take my eyes out for a while...cuz, yeah. He was on a webcam when we were talking..and he decided he wanted to show me his dick..and then he started  masturbating !! I freaked out...that was something that I really didn't need to see...at all...>.  But yeah...*shrug* I dunno. I'm mostly just worried...so that's really the only news I have...^^; so...yeah. baiobaio

      Blah...I feel so bad. I got Jeremie sick...and the bug I had, he has it 10x as bad as I did. ;.; So he's not at school today...and I'm worried sick cuz I dunno if he's ok or not.  But yeah..I did take my promotion at work...so I'm gonna be workin this thursday at 4 and then on saturday at 4:30. So I'll be getting less hours, but getting paid more. yay! *dances* But I'm not gonna be able to hang out with Jeremie cuz...yeah..he'll be in the dining room. ;.; *sigh* oh well..at least I'll have enough money on my next paycheck to buy myself that GBA sp that I want...and Fire Emblem...*drools* I'm so pitiful..I'm obsessed with Fire Emblem...^^;  Anywayz..notta much is really going on...I broke down at work yesterday...cuz I had really wanted to go home, and the guy who got there half an hour after me got cut right after he got there, so I had to work my full 4-something hours. It sucked..cuz my manager had to take me into one of the garden rooms so I could cry in peace...cuz, yeah...I had to keep going in the kitchen so I could cry.  But..that's all I'm gonna write right now...baiobaio.

      Adam is moving. To Pulaski. WTF IS UP WITH THAT???? He should stay here...*nodnod* but at least he'll have senior status and he'll still be able to go to Bay Port..otherwise I'd be sad. Really really sad.  I don't think Jeremie ever told Vicky that we're dating though. Cuz...yeah...she doesn't say anything about that. Ever. Which makes me wonder if Jeremie will end up doing something with her when he goes down to Ohio...I dunno. I'm prolly just being paraniod...but still...I don't want him to do anything stupid, yah know? *sigh* I just don't know...he prolly has his reasons, or maybe she does know but she never puts that in there. I don't know...meh.  Anywayz...today is Jeremie's birthday...and I have to work. so that SUCKS. Cuz I don't get to celebrate with him...and it's Henry's birthday too so I'm missing out on that along with it. Grr...I'm missing out on so much crap cuz of my job. But I love my job...so it's kinda worth it..cuz I'm gonna buy Jeremie something tomorrow if I can get to the mall..which would kick ass..^^; lol.  Anywayz...notta much is really going on. My mom is being a bitch about how I can't go down there on weekends anymore...and it's getting on my nerves. My job is more important than going to see her for a weekend!! Who cares if she lives in Madison?!?! It's 2 1/2 hours away for christ's sake! It's not like I can go visit her and she can bring me to work or something like that. Plus, she told me to ask off on some weekends and try to see her, but I really don't want to. I mean...I love my job. I don't want to leave it unless I absolutely have to. So...yeah.  Anywayz...I hear I'm getting a promotion at work!!! *dances* Yay!! I'm gonna be working in Banquet!! ^^ though I will miss my buss job...considering that Jeremie will be a busser soon...so I won't get to see him all that often...;.; that makes me sad. I was so excited cuz I'd get to work with him...and now I can't. ;.; So not cool.   But that's all for now..^^ baiobaio!

      Fwee! ^^; lol. I dunno..I'm just in a good mood today. My throat is feeling better and it's my lazy day at school...in which I only have 4 classes, and they're my easiest ones. (SS, Study Hall, Band, and Language) Yesterday sucked though...I have all my "hard" classes that day. (Study Hall(I know..not tough..it gets worse), Biology (we dissected the poor froggies! ;.;), French (that class is evil...), and Geometry (triple the evilness...*mutter*))  But yeah...Jeremie doesn't have ta work tonight..so I'm gonna go try and go to his house...cuz I won't be able to see him tomorrow until he drops me off at home, then work, and then back at home after work. And those will be really short periods of time...o.O ^^;. lol. I'm such a dork.  Anywayz...I get my paycheck tomorrow!!! *dances* chaahaaaaa!! lol. I can't wait for that...cuz then I'll make my dad take me to get it cashed..then talk Jeremie into coming with me to the mall, and then we'll go back to his house (hopefully) around noon to paint! ^^ yush..we're gonna paint his walls. yay! color! ^^;  But that's all for now...baiobaio!

      Blah..I dunno. I'm feeling better than I have been...my throat doesn't hurt as much as it did yesterday and monday...so I guess that's a good sign.  But yeah...I dunno. I'm just really tired lately. My meds were upped from 150mg to 300 mg...and I think it's making me get evil-ass headaches...so that sucks. I should prolly bring some ibuprofin to school tomorrow...yah think? ^^  Anywayz...using google to search for pictures for my poems is being a pain in the ass. I mean..I'll find pictures I want to use...but my school is stupid and won't let anyone right-click so I can't get it!!! ;.; It makes me sad cuz I really like them too..and they'd be perfect for the poem...but I can't get to them! Grr...oh well...I'll just have to find a different one I guess.  But yeah...I dunno. Henry is having a birthday party with all his little friends on Friday...and I have work..thank god. I don't wanna go watch a bunch of little first graders run around Chuck E Cheeses...considering last year their main goal was to knock me over and sit on top of me...damn little kids.  But yeah...Jeremie doesn't have work that day either...damnit. I wanted to hang out with him this weekend...and I kinda can't cuz when we could hang out I'll be working...but I think we're gonna go to the mall on Saturday after I get my paycheck...since I don't work until 5:30 and my dad said he'd take me to the bank Saturday morning to cash in my paycheck...yay! I'm gonna have money! ^^ lol.  That's the only news I really have...I'm gonna put up a new poem and hopefully my new prose on DeviantArt soon...once I get some damn pictures...stupid slow computers...>.  And...now I'm done. lol. baiobaio.

      Phew...I don't think I have to worry about Jeremie going to Ohio anymore...thank god. He's still going, but I'm feeling better about it. I mean...if anything happens it's prolly gonna happen whether I like it or not...I will be sad if something does that I don't want to happen...but I can't stop him. He wants to go on this road trip so bad...and I dont' want to stand in his way. That would just be selfish of me. I only hope that he'll come back and still love me...or love me more. (In the essence of that whole  Distance makes the heart grow fonder  type of thing...o.O ^^)  Anyways...I dunno. Emmy is feeling better...yay! *dances* I just wish that Sunny would come back...but I do have to say I don't really miss her extreme hyperness all that much. I've been so sick lately that I don't think I'd want to have to deal with it. I still miss talking to her though...  But yeah...I've been so sick lately..my throat is just starting to get better..but my voice is all fucked up and my head feels like it's gonna split open...ow...hopefully that'll go away soon. But I won't be able to get lunch today...;.; I'm all out of lunch money and I still don't have my ID card with me...cuz I think it went through the wash...or something...I dunno.  Blah..that's the only real news I have...Henry's and Jeremie's birthdays are on Friday...so I'm gonna have to buy them something on Saturday cuz I get my paycheck on Friday...and I won't be able to go to the bank until Saturday morning sometime. Then I just gotta get to the mall...o.O lol. But I do plan on getting a Gameboy Advance SP or w/e the hell it's called...lol. and Fire Emblem..cuz that game is really damn addicting. ^^; yes, I'm pathetic. lol.  And...thats it. Yup..that's all the news I have at the moment. So...I'm gonna stop wasting your time now. Baiobaio! ^^ :wave:

       I am just confused. Heather said that I shouldn't give him another chance because of how much he hurt me (you hurt me a lot) that I should just stick with Jeremie because he seems to be more truthful also because he isn't ghetto. But that is just Heather. She doesn't like guys that dress liek Chris. But everytime that I saw Chris but didn't talk to him I would think about him for like a week. I would always ask my mom why he affects me so much. She just said that he was my first love. He still has a major part of me.    AHHH!!!! I think Vicky really likes Jeremie and wants to date him...(aside from the guy Chris she's talking about in here....) ;.; This is not cool...cuz Jeremie replied to that...and what he wrote scares the shit out of me...:   *hugs tight* Just follow your heart and do what you feel is right. If you get lost, I'll do my best to be there to help. Just wish I could help you. First love will always keep a part of you. My first love still holds a part of me although i don't think she knows it, but i merely have to live with that. *hugs tight again* Just try to be as happy as you feel you need to be and try not to let things bother you much. Love you   meh...I love him so much...and I trust him...but...god...I don't know anymore. I'm so scared that I'm going to lose him...and I don't think I could handle that at all. I mean..he's one of the few people that I trust unconditionally (There's only two other people...Tim and Pete...)...the one person that I feel I'm meant to be with. I can understand the whole first love thing...I still have some of that from Jayme (yes...I do think that I did love him...cuz I still think about him occasionally...blah). But....*sigh* I don't know. Maybe I'm just being paranoid...but...god...I don't know what to think right now. Maybe I should just ignore it...and whatever happens will happen..whether I want it to or not.

      Blah...I dunno really what to type today..but I thought I would...  My meds aren't fully working anymore...I've been getting depressed really easily lately and I've almost broken down at work at least twice...which isn't good. *shrug* I dunno. I guess I'm just tired of feeling sad and I wanna feel better...but it's not working!  But yeah..I have work next weekend too...5:30 on Friday and Saturday, and then 10 again on Sunday. Grr...But Jeremie's last day at Texas Roadhouse is on Friday!! ^^ yay!! That means he'll be working at Rock Garden with me sooooooon! ^^;  Anywayz..I dunno. I couldn't get on my damn computer yesterday cuz it was being extremely stupid...damn computer. It wouldn't connect to the internet so I couldn't do anything. So I called Jeremie and ended up talking to him for like...4 hours (I should note, we almost never talk on the phone...so its amazing that we talked for that long..^^). But I got cut for work when I was supposed to...so that was a good thing. But yeah..I had Gail freak out at me for a bunch...so I got really depressed towards the end of our convo..cuz..yeah...Gail's a bitch and she enjoys making me feel like shit.  Other than that...not much is really going on today. I, for some odd reason, can't find my ID or my poetry folder...so I'm kinda ticked about that...but I'll prolly find them tonight. (If you wanna see my poetry...go  here  ^^)  Yeah..that's all I really have for now...baiobaio! *waves*

      Yeah..I dunno. I have work tonight at 5:30...which is prolly gonna suck cuz I don't know who's all gonna be bussing besides Cody and me..hopefully Dillon is there...otherwise we're prolly screwed...  But yeah..I'm finally talking to that Jon kid who left me a note last weekend when I was at work. (He'd been following me around practically, and had left the note with my manager that had his AIM sn on it..so I decided I'd talk to him. It's gonna kill him when he finds out I have a boyfriend..^^ *giggle*)And he's actually a pretty cool guy. I'm thinking I could prolly be really good friends with him.  Anywayz...I dunno. I'm still kinda worrying about Jeremie going on his road trip to Ohio...cuz I can tell that Vicky likes him..she wouldn't put him as one of her "interests" if she didn't. And...I dunno. I trust Jeremie, but I don't know if I can trust her or not. Maybe I'm just being paranoid..but he's gonna be gone for  two weeks  and I won't be able to talk to him at  all !! ;.; I'm gonna miss him so much when he goes...  But yeah...I'm gonna try and get my mom's computer...cuz she said she doesn't miss it at all. So I think I'll just have Adam give me the tower and have my sis get the screen and keyboard and mouse and shit..cuz, yeah, I won't be able to go down there anytime soon cuz of work...since they only have me working on weekends. Stupid people.  I dunno..that's all I really have for now..I'm prolly gonna put some more poems up on DA ( my account ^^ )..which will be cool cuz everyone seems to like my poems...o.O I dunno why...but they do.  And that's all the news I have for today...baiobaio! ^^

      yesh..i'm bored...^^    LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.    urlLink   Love test thingy...o.O ^^     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Nerdslut    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Your: Wondering eyes. Your not quite focused and your quite the day dreamer. Your a bit odd and as many say "Your head is in the clouds."     urlLink   What type of eyes do you have?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You have a Lost Soul. No one is really sure what that can always mean, because it can be defined in many ways. As Legend goes, lost souls were the spirits of passed away people who are neither in heaven nor hell. They walk the earth, brooding mysteriously, always appearing when you expect it least. So hence, if you have a Lost Soul, then you are probably very insecure and shy. Stuck in your own little box, you watch the world fly by as a loner. You dont know your place. You seemingly dont have a place in society or an interest. You are a very capricious person, and are confused and frustrated about where you belong. You crave for the sense and feeling of home-but have not obtained it yet.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You're Element is Night. You're a loner who is very creative but never show your work to anyone. You may smile a little but sadness or loneliness surround you and other can feel it when they're near you. You have a dark or unusual beauty that makes you mysterious and you probably have a lot of secrets that you've never told anyone. You're beauty is intriging and unorthidox but the real thing that makes you special is your eyes. Something in them makes them like "Diamonds in the Rough"    urlLink   What's Your Element(girls)? (PICTURES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      You're a Vampire. Vampires were the creatures of the night that were believed to live off of human blood. Count Dracula, being the most famous vampire, set the stereotype. They had dark hair and pale skin from being away from the sunlight. If they actually existed, it's very possible they had the skin disease that made you allergic to the sun so whenever the sunlight would hit it, it would hurt like crazy. They were usually snobbish and control freaks and kept werewolves as pets.(please rate)    urlLink   What Mystical Creature Are You?
