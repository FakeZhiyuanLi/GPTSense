      Today went pretty well.  I wasn't too sure what I was going to do with my kindergarteners today because having them for only 30 minutes (with how they act) can take a long time trying to get them into groups.  Especially when they do not understand English at ALL.  IT totally bites when that happens.  So  today we go the lines for exercises (which they will forget by next time) and then it took another while to get into lines for doing walking (relay lines) We didn't even have time to finish one with the last group.  They just do not like to stop talking.   It was so great yesterday. My aunt came into town with my cousin who is going to school here and I got to go to the baseball game with her and her friends.  It was kind of funny but they all seem kind of out there to me.  They are almost 50 but act my age.  What's up with that??   My aunt's friends are going to try and get me some babysitting jobs so I can earn a little cash here on the side.  But for now just gotta keep track of it all.  Well I gotta go jump in the shower before my boy comes home.  (I am REALLY dirty)  Kind of abrupt but I will try to blog later

      Well I did clean up the house, I didn't quite clean it (except the bathroom) but it looks a heck of a lot better.  It makes me feel better.  Today when he gets home I think we are going to go walk around the mall. I just want to get out the house to see what is out there. I have not actually gone shopping me for in a long while. It kind of stinks sometimes. I just know that I don't have the money to really go spend any right now, but hopefully soon we can do that. I don't really like all those sexy clothes any more, I want to look cute just not slutty.  I mean come on have you seen the skirts that some of these 8 year olds now wear. I could never imagine having a child wear something so short. I am glad that at the school I am at they have to wear uniforms, but even some of them are too short. (They had a thing on CNN last night about companies not making clothes that kids are allowed to wear to school)  I know some of the stuff that they do sell now I won't wear.  It makes me feel like I am trying to sell myself to other guys attractions by doing that and that's not my walk of life. Well that's my rant for now talk later

      Today a day at home to get things done that I couldn't get done during the week.  Much to busy now that I have started teaching. I mean come on I am working fourty plus hours a week and then come home and try to clean up a little bit and to cook my man some food.(at least attempting to cook) I am getting better at it though (or at least he says I am).  Teaching is not as easy as I thought it would be.  You trying keeping 30 5-year olds in one little area while trying to explain something to them that they are going to do.  Oh man, not an easy task!  I am managing though.  It could be worse.  I could be the type of person that totally dislikes thier job and totally ruins the joy of another person's career by ambushing them.  Now that wouldn't be nice.  Also I never thought that kids in elementary talked as much as they do.  Do you remember when you were younger it didn't really matter if you had to be in a group with a boy at the age of 6 or 7, well that totally isn't the case anymore.  We have the so called popular groups in each class that won't touch another boy, so I had a fun activity last week for all first thru third grades.  I couldn't believe that they would not get into groups with people of the opposite sex.  They finally would when I bribed them with water.  Now how sad is that??  Give me a break!  I told them if they would get it quick enough that they wouldn't have to stand next to them that long, but they were like "yuck I am not touching him/her"  I actually wish I would have had a video camera. :-)  Well I am going to go do some cleaning so I will blog back at you at a later time.   :-) Mandi
