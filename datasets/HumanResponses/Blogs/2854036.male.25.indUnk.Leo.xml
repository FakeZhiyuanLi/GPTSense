       Hey, I sent you an "invitation" to this blog that you have to accept, then this blog will be yours. Did you get it?

       Once we get this set up I'll delete this post and you can do what you want with your blog. I can help you set it up how you want it or you can do it yourself, or leave it as is. I don't think you can host your own pictures with this free blogspot hosting, but if you ever really need to we can probably figure something out.

      Blogger has some pretty snazzy stuff now, but will it show a picture when I update via email?  If this works, you'll see what our kitchen may look like in the near future.  (edit) This doesn't seem to work, so I'll add the image the old fashioned way.   kitchen

      Sandy City is probably going to let another big ugly shopping center be built in the sand pit that was always supposed to be turned into Sandy City Central Park. That Sucks! See  this.

      It's pretty hard to find bike rims around here. I finally got a used one at the Highlander bike shop for $15, yippie! I also took off the handlebar ends that caused me to crash in the first place.

      It didn't hurt much the day I crashed, but it sure hit me the next day. I had started to think I had broken a rib. I'm finally getting better and can move around again. Tomorrow I'll probably try to find a new rim.

      My bike's outward facing handlebars caught the fence at Willow Canyon  and I was thrown off the bike today. My front rim is totally bent. I landed a few feet away on my knees, elbows, and the top joints of my pinkies.  Yesterday Rahula (my cat) carried home a baby duck that got seperated from it's mother. He didn't hurt it at all, he carried it like a kitten. We found the flock wandering the neighborhood and reunited the duck with it's mom. I wish I would have thought to take a picture of the duck, but I didn't.

      I feel I need a bit more color around here. I'm going to be working on redesigning the site with a touch of gold. Here's a  sample  of what I'm probably going to do. After the redesign is done I'll be posting any new things I may be working on at that same link.

      With all the stuff that's been added to the site recently I've almost reached 50MB of data on my server. A picture of Maya will push me over the edge. After this I will be using over 1% of my web space!

      I am adding a guestbook to my site. I'm just putting the link here while I work on customizing it. Feel free to sign the guestbook, but keep in mind that your signature could possibly be deleted if you sign before the guestbook officially opens, which will be signified by a link on my main site.

      Lari found my site and emailed me a few days back. If anybody out there wants to get ahold of him lemme know. I'll be updating my site to reflect this (and maybe some other things) when I get over my extreme bout of laziness.
