      well, i've been skipping work for several days now. but today was different. I actually went to office plus got some work done too. But lets see whether i can maintain this. Now that'll be something to brag about. smaller victories mean nothing, its the big ones that count. _______________________________________________________________________________________ one more achievement.. i've been trying to start watching Smallville for some time now. And luckily today i have started watching it.. seen the first two episodes of the first season. Was something really worth seeing.   All in all.. had a real good day today.. . but i've been better.. and those days will never return i think.

         In the distant future...  With technology spreading across the internet, information sharing had a sense of value and importance which enabled easy communication. However, there were a number of cases in which there were communication problems. Crimes committed by network hackers began to spread onto a worldwide scale due to the disperse of secret information. Will we be able to keep track of where this is going?  One such case happened on a certain day when the stock prices repeatedly jumped, which lead to depreciation in the New York Stock Exchange. The hacker who was responsible was detected by the server through the transaction, but he has yet to be arrested. The establishment was under the United Nations WNC (The Worldwide Network Council). The danger in the network still continues to increase.  And it happened suddenly... In the year 2005 the main computer that was connected to the network for the entire world, stopped working on December 24th. The communication controls and the other networks connected experienced a network collision in a worldwide scale. After this incident, the network recovered its performance 77 minutes later. The automatic retaliatory system of the United States began to operate erroneously and was dangerously moving to a point of crisis, which was connected to a terrestrial existence. The "Pluto Kiss" virus which attacked was created by a mere 10-year-old elementary school student...  Among the few, the "ALTIMIT" OS was not affected by the "Pluto Kiss" at all. Eventually, the WNC announced that the majority of the network servers of the entire world will switch to the ALTIMIT OS, in 2007, 2 years after the incident.  In addition, the restriction of the network utilization of entertainment system was removed in the same year, December 24th. Simultaneously on the same day, the MMORPG "The World" was sold. The United Nations declared the safety of the network and "The Mother Mary's Kiss" was named and was known as an international holiday.  And on December 24th of 2007... 0 o'clock and 0 minutes, the worldwide simultaneous download of "The World" began. "The World" will bring disasterous incidents years later, without anyone realizing it now...
