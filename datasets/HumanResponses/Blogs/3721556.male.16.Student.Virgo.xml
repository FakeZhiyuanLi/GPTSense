      ALright, i'm really fucking tired of this shit. I'm talking about my school, Abington Heights, and the fuckig druggie scum that resides there. I fucking hate how my school talks about how our community is very clean, and drug free, when in reality there's practically a fucking ghetto in part of it and there's alchohol and drugs flowing freely into the hands of kids!!!! FUUUUUUUUUCK! it makes me so mad to see this shit! There's this street corner by my school, and all the ICP druggie fuckers go there to smoke before and after school, and i swear on my life that i have watched our school cop drive by them and not say a fucking word! thats total shiiiiit!!!!!! I mean, these little fucks will sit in my math class and talk about how they're gonna smoke pot over the weekend, and nobody gives two shits about it! and where the hell are they getting this shit?????!?!?!? I mean, i know that they get it ffrom friends, but where do the friends get it? And society makes drugs look funny and cool and not serious, i mean, look at all the sitcoms on tv cracking jokes about smoking pot and what not, very nonchalantly. I mean look at fucking movies for godsakes!!!!!! Cheech and Chong have been around forever making smoking pot look cool, and nobody gives two fucking shits about it!!!!!!!! i hate how our society is accepting marijuana as a normal thing for kids to get into, cause it realy fucking isn't.I cannot stand a society that accepts drugs and alchohol! I mean, why are cigarettes and beer fucking legal?!?!?!it makes no sense to me! And look at other places like amsterdam, where it's fucking legal to smoke pot there, aaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!! makes me so godamned mad. I'm telling you guys, we need to reform and totally wipe this shit out. Do whatever you can around your town to fucking stomp these druggies out. I'm doing my best over here, try to do your part too.

      Alright, ya know what's been eating at me lately? The way most youths of my generation are acting lately. It's 13 year old girls having sex with 25 year old men. Is that just a little fucked up to anyone? Kids walking around with their pants past their ass, girls with thongs(ick) showing past their pants, kids dealing drugs in school. I mean, they say how they're cracking down on drugs???? Thats total shit! If i wanted some pot, or coke, i could walk down the street and get it if i wanted too! It's ridiculous, and i think alot of it is to blame on MTV. Supid mtv makes it look cool to have your ass hang outta your pants, and that its cool for a young girl to have sex with older men and do drugs and drink and all that stupid shit that you godamned idiots are doing lately! I mean, all the scum in my school(abington heights) like the druggies and drug dealers, and older pervs are the ones that get the girls now! Any kid with some brains, refuses drugs, and dates people HIS AGE, is very unlikely to ever be considered by any women. Fortunatly, im one of the few lucky ones that has found a girl that actually has morals and such :). Stupid rap videos preach  smoke pot, blah blah, pimp my 15 year old 9th grade girls, blah blah, im a player, blabbity blah, i didnt get past fifth grade homie! . It's total shit, and someones gotta stop it. How do i know all this? because for the past month of school, i was thrown into the thick of it. I was transferred from public school to some kinda stupid military charter school crap. And you shoulda seen the kids there. All the big drug dealers and such were surrounded by girls! I had to put up with wiggers and drug dealers, whores and skanky 13 year olds. No NO, i was never hit on by them (thank you god, if you;re up there) But i got shit because i wear tight black jeans and a jacket with patches all over it instead of wearing an over sized baseball jersey with a marijuana leaf on the front and my pants at my ankles? They say that they're tolerant of all people, because their whole rap culture is mixed race i guess, but all day i got shit for my clothing, my music, "why your shoes so weird son?" was a comment made towards my combat boots. "why you gotta wear them red suspenders dog?" ya know what i wanna say to them? "WHY CAN'T YOU SPEAK PROPER ENGLISH YOU RETARD?!?!?!? grrrrrr, i hate it, and i dont want my kids growing up with this shit, because i'll be godamned if they turn out like that.    anyhoots, thanks for listening to me, nobody else will :p

      Can't a guy be naked in his own house!?!?!?!? I am sitting here, playing games on the computer, in just a towel(just got out of the shower) And then my brother and his little doom minions come tearing into my godamned house and start mauling my cats! There's this one kid sean, that is going to be a serial rapist when he grows up, because he used to sneak into womens bathrooms when he was a little younger, and tried to watch women pee! He always makes comments about my girlfriends boobs and stuff, and it dives me mad! ANyway, these little bastards go into my room, throw my clothes everywhere,and once i grabbed sean by his shirt and dragged him outside, so the little shit went home and told his mom i friggen beat him senseless. grrrrrrrrr i hate them they're here right now chasing my cats and screaming and arguing over who gets to hold the cats when they catch them. meanwhile im still here barely clothed screaming at them to leave and it's like im invisible, omg sometimes i wish murder was legal in some instances! grrrr...

      OKay, there's a big straight edge rally in allentown this weeked, i guess all the punks and skins from around the east coast are gonna be there. If ya don't know what straight edge is, here's the scoop. Straight edge is a lifestyle where you devote yourself to stopping the spread of drugs. No smoking No drinking No drugs of any kind, and when you do those things, or even worse, SUPPLY those things to others, you loose your rights as a human being, and are shunned.  Anywho's gonna be some real cool bands playing there, Including Sham69, Warhungry,the 4skins, and tons others! all the bands there are oi bands, so it's gonna be alot of fun. I won't be attending though, gotta spend as much time as possible with casey before i leave for evil boot camp :(.

      I think i may be the luckiest guy in the universe, because i am in a realtionship with the girl of my dreams :). We've been dating since just last christmas, and it's been an amzaing time. I mean, i truely truely love this girl, i dunno, its weird, i've neer felt about anyone this way before, it makes me feel all bubbly inside *hee hee*. But like seriously, if any body has some comments on realtionships like this, please post a comment here,  that'd be greatly appreciated :).  I LOVE YOU MORE THAN LIFE IT SELF CASEY!!! :) (and trust me, im a big fan of life, so, yea, that means i love you alot^_^)           okay, i hate drugs soooooooo soo soo soo much. i cant stand em, they piss me off so much i just wanna scream. AAARAAAAAAAARGH! everyone should just go straight edge in my opinion, they should have a zero tolerance for drugs, or for the scum on my boots that sell them. I say death to all druggies! i almost got kicked outta my last school for an incident involving a drug argument. In my drug and alchohol class, we had to draw anti-drug posters, and mine were  *ahem* a little graphic, and such, involving druggies getting kicked in the head by boots and what not, and they htreatened to call the police. But i think they should be happy that at least one kid in this whole fucked up generation has the sense and the balls to do away with all that peer pressure shit and friggin respect my body, ya know? oh well, enough ranting for me, i think im gonna go night night, going out with casey tommorow :) Im already beaming ^_^ night everyone.

      I think that everyone of you should go out and buy the cheap sex album "launch off to war" Theyr'e an amazing punk band with pro bush adminstration with songs like "launch off to war" and "dick cheney and the boys" Man i love that launch off to war song "look up at the sky see the bombs falling down, life doesnt matter when it's not on our ground!" it's a  very neat and inspiring song.   WOw, i cant stop posting, im on a roll here

      ALright listen up, and listen up good fella's. I'm tired of this whole new peace punk leftie movement i'm hearing about. Ugh. i mean c'mon, you all should know that punk rock was founded on right wing ideals. take the sex pistols for example, with their anti-abortion lyrics and such. Or how bout the casualties, with their "kill the lefties" song? now i'm not condoning any violence towards democrats or the like, but hey, classic punk, right wing ideas :).    On another note, i want my permit already! i'm gonna be turning seventeen soon and no permit, ugh, i love how my girlfriends mom drives us everywhere, makes me feel REAL cool with myself. ;p.   wow.....i post alot
