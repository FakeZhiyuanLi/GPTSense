      My gorgeous beloved flatmate has decided to spend the summer in London for some unfathomable reason.  She's been gone 2 weeks now and I MISS HER!!!  It's just poo without her - top 10 things I'm missing about not having her around...  1)&nbsp; Nobody to share wine and giggles whilst watching BB / Eastenders / 55 Degrees North etc... 2)&nbsp; Nobody to share hungover, morning after the&nbsp;night before stories with 3)&nbsp; Nobody to have impromptu visits to the pub with 4)&nbsp; Nobody to tell me to iron my clothes before I leave the house 5)&nbsp; Nobody to put glitter on my back / shoulders before going out 6)&nbsp; Nobody to just loaf about in jarmies with on a Sunday afternoon  7)&nbsp; I can plug the phone into charge and nobody falls over the wire in a comedy fashion - (my flatmate without fail falls over the wire EVERY time!)&nbsp; It's&nbsp;funny but I guess you have to be there... 8)&nbsp; Nobody to hug me and cheer me up when I was sad this week, because&nbsp;my rat baby had&nbsp;to go&nbsp;the great rat house in the sky 9)&nbsp; Nobody there that just 'gets' me 10)&nbsp; Nobody to get hysterical with&nbsp;when finding&nbsp;slugs / spiders / moths in the flat  Come home soon sweetie - Newcastle NEEDS YOU!!!&nbsp; xxx

       This is what happens if you get Katie and I in an msn window together.    Brace yourselves!    Fluff says:  ello babes you still at work?   kate says:  Aye - it's a bugger innit? Oooh are you all full of tea now? I'm doing budget monitoring / audit stuff - YAWN!   Fluff says:  yeah full of tea kinda.. mum made it. wish she hadnt bothered over done fishfingers and underdown peas and sweetcorn   kate says:  Mmmmm, Yum What is it about fish fingers? It's like they go from being frozen, to not quite done, to burnt - in the blink of an eye?   Fluff says:  heh its a phenomenomenom   kate says:  Oh god - that reminds me of a bloke I met on the 4 dating site that I shagged out of politeness - he looked like captain birdseye   Fluff says:  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   kate says:  In fact I think he was probably older and mingier than captain birdseye. Like his older, uglier, more perverse brother or something???   Fluff says:  omg thats a story for the blog right there !  Fluff says:  and you need to put pics up  Fluff says:  for comparison hehe   kate says:  He didn't smell of fish tho. Which I suppose under the circumstances is the only up side I can see to that story...  kate says:  Aw it's a blog story and a half that one!   Fluff says:  *refrains from saying something about after shagging did he have fishy fingers?*  Fluff says:  hey you know how to post pics across that are hosted elsewhere on the net right? its cheating but easy   kate says:  *squeals and then falls off chair laughing*   Fluff says:  *flutters eyelashes*   kate says:  And for the record, no, they smelt of roses! Or something...   Fluff says:  hahaha of course!  Fluff says:  dont get all that fish talk anyway   kate says:  But hey, I didn't know you could post piccies from elsewhere on the net. I could mebs use my 4 dating pic, or at least part of it? I don't have a picture of him - thank god! It was a blind date - lets just say his idea of fit and mine are WORLDS apart! If only I was blind - then I'd have an excuse! Ooooh - you've changed!   Fluff says:  hehe yeah and yeah and er yeah.. oh and a visual of birds eye man would be funny though  Fluff says:  where's your dating pic?   kate says:  It's on the channel 4 dating site. I'm gonna see if I can post it here - hang on a sec!   Fluff says:  you can.. you just go on the pic.. then right click and select 'properties' then copy the address/url and use it as a link  Fluff says:     Fluff says:  like that  Fluff says:  am sending a pic of my tattoo on my moblog   kate says:  Awww it's all soooo technical Will try and sort pic and then run over to yours for tattoo ogling   Fluff says:  heh   kate says:  Yay!

Fluff says:  mind you if your after a degree of anonimity thats not a bad thing i suppose   kate says:  GENIUS!!!!   Fluff says:  heh what? what did i say?   kate says:  About the anonimity! It's like I'm on the telly discussing sensitive info and I have to have my identity protected!   Fluff says:  argh fucking hotmails servers too busy and my tat pics in my inbox  Fluff says:  hahah yes! like the voice disguise   kate says:  Fucking TIT WANKING hotmail!

Fluff says:  hahah  Fluff says:  its never good when you have to ask that of a fella is it   kate says:  I'd rather ask the entire male population of 'Small Penis Land' than shag Ole Captain Birdsters again!   Fluff says:  hahahah.. hey at least they'd think twice about double penetration they'd have to overcompensate   kate says:  tehehe!   Fluff says:  right i blogged the pic  Fluff says:  of my tat i mean btw!   kate says:  Ooooh! And knickers too! You spoil us missy! Is it something celtic?   Fluff says:  its a flower with like tendrils .. no other meaning as far as i can tell although at the time i had a choice of petal colours and got them in blue after this bloke i was crazy about  Fluff says:  how poor is that!  Fluff says:  his nickname was Blue see  Fluff says:  as in Blue Veined Picalo  Fluff says:  coz hi surname was  CENSORED    kate says:  Not poor at all hun! I've only got that celtic crown thingy because that's where my ex's name was. Only it was spelt   CENSORED   Fluff says:  TEEHEE mind you.. no offence but&nbsp; CENSORED  better could almost be a sexual thing   kate says:  Jesus - you'd have to have a clown's pocket to attempt summat like that eh?   Fluff says:  HAHA  Fluff says:  *draws the purse strings tighter*   kate says:  And exactly - Howay - I couldn't be seen walking around with   CENSORED &nbsp; on me arm could I?   Fluff says:  heh... i can see the necessity!  Fluff says:  hey   kate says:  Deffo a lesson learnt there... Yes?   Fluff says:  if they cover the petals in a red colour will that merge a little with the blue and make it purple ?   kate says:  Might do? But you could just get them coloured in purple if you fancied?   Fluff says:  HEHEHEH  Fluff says:  fuckin ell thats funny   kate says:  What do you think you'll get done next?   Fluff says:  yeah i'll go the easy route trust me  Fluff says:  erm i dunno... would like to add to the one i got i guess, i just love the position and dont like a lot of bits of me body anyway to draw more attention to em etc.  Fluff says:  just dont know what to add  Fluff says:  maybe more flowers and tendrils.. one flower head for each of me kids? but ten i#d be a bit of a bouquet going on down there  Fluff says:  then*  Fluff says:  it'd*  Fluff says:  damnit my typing   kate says:  A bouquet - I'm liking it! Suppose it just depends on how big you want it to be. So is it on your hip then?   Fluff says:  no middle of my back lower  Fluff says:  so i got plenty of room to go horizontal   kate says:  Did you see the up the wrong-un pic I posted?

It's FUNNY! Well I think it is!   Fluff says:  hah running as we speak   kate says:  Not crap at all, I didn't design any of mine either. I just picked them out of books and stuff...   Fluff says:  yeah but in a way i should of.. was funny doing it on the spur with a mate.. when i got home to bloke he took one look and was horrified that id done that without asking him   kate says:  TOSSER! It's your back! What right has he got to be horrified! The day you tattoo his back is the day you need to ask permission, till then it's soooo none of his business!   Fluff says:  see why i left him?  Fluff says:  kate says:  totally hun!   kate says:  There she is - Koba Verde!

Wrong-uns love all things bad!   Fluff says:  thats good.. coz i meant the 10$ not the 3k   kate says:  He! He! You know I think it'd be cool just to post this convo on one of our blogs. Mine mebs to explain why I've been so quiet today?!? Whady'a recon?   Fluff says:  heh sounds like a brilliant plan! but pick a bit without my  CENSORED   Fluff says:  the porno bits fine HAHAHAHAHA  Fluff says:  god the morals of THAT   kate says:  We haven't said anything about &nbsp; CENSORED   for that matter in this one!   Fluff says:  HAHAHA oops   kate says:  Wrong-un's don't do morals either!   Fluff says:  which again is lucky!  Fluff says:  *sighs* it IS a mighty fine ass  Fluff says:  *eyes glaze over*   kate says:  Of course! It's the way forward! (morals or lack of them that is...   CENSORED  ... Mind you..?)    kate says:  Dreadlocked men have a similar effect on me. Phwarrrrrr.... Drooling now!   Fluff says:  (you really aught to bite it next time&nbsp; CENSORED  ) oh and was just reading up and the convos a riot... you could post it practically right up to the bit about posting it or something  Fluff says:  ought*  Fluff says:  oh and i think we should discuss  CENSORED   Fluff says:  *likes being naughty*   kate says:  Yeah! I think it'd be fab - don't think anyone else has ever done that. (the posting not the biting of&nbsp; CENSORED )   Fluff says:  *alot*  Fluff says:  i know i have  Fluff says:  the biting not the posting  Fluff says:   kate says:  RUDE! We LIKE IT!

Bloggers - they'd be expecting a webcast next time   Fluff says:  i know! they are sick... .oo( oo bit appealing!)   kate says:  But if I suddenly start talking about &nbsp; CENSORED   be thinking, hang on a minute...? Surely!   Fluff says:  hehe why? we all talk about  CENSORED    kate says:  And I for sure would be one of the bloggers going WEBCAST! WEBCAST! WEBCAST!   Fluff says:  hahaha   kate says:  But that's because I'm a wrong-un and I have no morals   Fluff says:  there ARE alot of internet cafes in major cities arent there   kate says:  Sod that!&nbsp; CENSORED  a webcam in&nbsp; CENSORED  orifice. *choughs* Sorry, I meant office!   Fluff says:  tell me when you've posted by the way i wanna seeeeeeeee .. oh and you could always blot out the bits about&nbsp; CENSORED  and what i said by going "CENSORED" over it in red... that'd get em wondering hehe  Fluff says:  HAHAHAHA  Fluff says:  *turns hers ON*  Fluff says:  *using her nipple*   kate says:  And then you could censor &nbsp; CENSORED   bit too.

      'Scuse me.&nbsp; (blows snot into a hanky)   Today I have a cold and am feeling like a pig really has shat in my head.  And there I was being all smug at work because I hadn't been struck down with the bug that's affected just about everyone and&nbsp;then I go and get it over the weekend.&nbsp;   It'll be all that clean living I did last week that's done it.&nbsp; Well clearly a lesson to be learnt there boys and girls!&nbsp; Shan't be doing that again in a hurry.  I got a surprise gift this morning but am in a little bit of a quandry over it.&nbsp; When I got up I found a parcel for me from amazon.&nbsp; Inside was a Dreadzone CD I've wanted for ages and a note which read&nbsp; 'To Mrs You - From Mr Me xxx.'&nbsp;   It was&nbsp;from my ex.&nbsp; Now don't get me wrong, I like a surprise gift as much as the next girl.&nbsp; Especially a cd from the techno-dub masters themselves.&nbsp; But it totally threw me.&nbsp; I guess he was as confused by the hugs the other day as I was eh?&nbsp;   I rang him to say thanks and we had a long chat.&nbsp; He asked if I was seeing anyone and I said no, because I'm not.&nbsp; But I told him about JB, a guy from World HQ I have&nbsp;the odd&nbsp;daft laugh with.&nbsp; And god, it was wierd telling him.&nbsp; I think I would have felt more comfortable scooping my own eye ball&nbsp;out with a blunt spoon!&nbsp; But he was fine with it, apart from making a snorting  'oh well that's just typical'  noise when I admitted that JB was a dreaded, pierced, tattoo'd crusty hippy.&nbsp; But I suppose that's to be expected.&nbsp; Then I had to take a deep breath and ask him if he'd met anyone.&nbsp; Turns out he met this bird in a club and saw her a few times and then called it off because he felt like it was too much too soon.&nbsp; But I'm taking it as a good sign that I have no jealous feelings towards her and no resentment towards him.&nbsp; Then I broke the tension by breaking wind really loudly down the phone at him and we both rolled around in fits of giggles for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we tried&nbsp;to work out why pumps can smell of eggs when you haven't had any just&nbsp;like when you're sick and there's carrots in it but you haven't had any of them either?&nbsp; We're so mature.&nbsp; But maybe, just maybe, it's a sign that we're finally moving on...

      This week I have been FAR to healthy!  Long walks in the country, no alcohol, only erm  smoking   every other day and consuming more healthy meals than you&nbsp;can shake an organic celery stick at.   So healthy in fact, I feel a bit odd.&nbsp; A bit not right.&nbsp; A bit spacey.&nbsp; A bit down right WRONG!  I've worked it out though - I'm in need of a good re-toxification session.&nbsp; Starting in about, oh, now.&nbsp; ( Cracks open a beer, lights a fag and applies glitter in preparation for the night ahead...)    &nbsp; Ah,&nbsp;feeling better already&nbsp;- is it my round?

      There are currently over 120 human beings in the city of Newcastle alone, that are homeless and destitute due to the fuck up that is this country's Asylum Appeals Process.  These families and individuals are in limbo since the government saw fit to suspended all removals to Congo and Burundi on Thursday 1st July.&nbsp; They receive no state support as they have had their claim for&nbsp;asylum refused and they have not yet been removed from the country and have no idea when they will be able to leave.  There are two charities in the city that are dedicated to helping the&nbsp;people affected by this hideous situation.&nbsp; The Newcastle West End Refugee Service (WERS) and Common Ground.&nbsp; They offer advice, support, food, clothes, toiletries etc...&nbsp; However WERS will run out of funds next week.  How wrong is that?  I've had a blitz of my wardrobe and just spent twenty quid in superdrug on toothpaste / toothbrushes / soap etc...&nbsp; Having been homeless myself, I KNOW how precious these things can be!  And if there's over a hundred people being forced to live like this in Newcastle - how many are there having to do exactly the same thing in other cities?  Jesus the world if Fucked UP!  For more info check out  urlLink www.freefestival.org  and click on the WERS / Charities icon.

      If life runs in cycles I think I've reverted back to my 18 year old self.  Only this time I have responsibilities that get in the way of being as daft as I was back then.  Not that you'd notice - I have a really important Management Committee meeting that I have to facillitate tonight and what am I doing? -&nbsp;Preparing Notes?&nbsp; Checking Minutes / Agenda's? &nbsp;-NOPE! - waffling here is much more appealing so that's what I'm doing.  Also I have two dangerous attributes that I didn't have when I was 18 - a greater capacity for drinking&nbsp; (and er... all things associated shall we say, nudge nudge wink wink)&nbsp;and a bit of cash.  I blame boys, well at the very least my&nbsp;last relationship.&nbsp; It's like I have to find myself again and the best way I can figure to do that is to go back to how I was before and start again.&nbsp; A&nbsp;plan that me and my oldest, bestest mate Sozza G, decided may be a tad flawed, during our two hour catch up phone call last night.  Why are all&nbsp;my mates getting married / buying houses / having babies / carreer obsessed?  And why do I just feel the need to be wankered and giggling and doing inappropriate things as often as possible?  Sozza G, made me feel much better though&nbsp;coz she's just bought a new house for Â£149K.&nbsp; Hey that makes my cumulative debt seem almost insignificant!&nbsp;   Drink anyone?&nbsp;

      Don't know about you but my body clock is shot! &nbsp; This is possibly something to do with my insomnia, I'm thinking.&nbsp; Still no joy on the getting a full night's sleep front, but I'm hoping it's just a phase. &nbsp; Go and see Farenhiet 9/11 - If you don't think it's excellent I'll give you your ticket price back, or at least buy you a pint... &nbsp; Bloody typical, just about to finish work for the day and the sun's gone in and it's started to rain!&nbsp; Shan't be doing any country walking, cobweb clearing tonight then.&nbsp; And me washings on the line. &nbsp; Today my ex came to my work with a box&nbsp;things that&nbsp;I'd forgotten were at his house.&nbsp; He's over the 'I hate you' stuff, well for the minute anyway.&nbsp; I suppose I know he was just pissed and hurting when he sent the nasty texts.&nbsp; It was actually really good to see him.&nbsp; He looked more attractive today than he has done in months.&nbsp; Mind you, that could be something to do with the fact that a)&nbsp; I have had some appauling 'dates' over the last&nbsp;couple weeks and b)&nbsp; as a result of (a) I haven't had a shag in just as long.&nbsp; And he smelt nice too.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Aw bollocks!&nbsp; Enough of the sentimentality!&nbsp; All the hugs and nice smells in the world wouldn't make us two right for each other and maybe if we'd accepted that earlier we wouldn't now be in such an emotional pickle.&nbsp; It's a well known fact that scruffy hippies and massive oil company computer programmer business types&nbsp;are just not meant to be together!&nbsp; It's like the chalk and cheese thing;&nbsp;because I think that everything can be dandy if you are say, brie, and your partner is say, cheddar.&nbsp; Everything can be lovely and happy coz at least you're both cheeses.&nbsp; But if you're say, a cheese, in a relationship with a table or a spoon or a piece of chalk or whatever, the fact is it's never gonna work is it? &nbsp; So there...

      &nbsp; Yesterday was gorgeous!&nbsp; Warm and Sunny and VERY beautiful! &nbsp; So I decided to make the most of the fine wheather and drive up to Northumberland then go for&nbsp;long walk&nbsp;in the country side.&nbsp; And as I was&nbsp;out and about,&nbsp;I noticed these really bizzare little creatures!&nbsp; They were like some kind of butterfly / wasp crossbreed thingy?&nbsp; Their bodies were&nbsp;all black where a wasp's would be yellow and black and they had big, long black antennae things too.&nbsp;&nbsp;But unlike wasps, they had these really pretty red wings, like a butterfly! &nbsp; Now I grew up in the countryside so I kind of know a bit about insects, ie: does it bite / sting / eat spiders etc...&nbsp;- but these little critters were new to me!&nbsp; (Oh and they seemed to like clover to sit on, or whatever&nbsp;it is exactly they do on flowers?) &nbsp; But whatever they are they were out in force yesterday!&nbsp; Some kind of black wasp butterfly, big&nbsp;day out or something. &nbsp; Any ideas about what they could be?&nbsp; I'm flummoxed, although it'll give me something new to look for on the net when I'm pretending to be busy at work. &nbsp; I also found an old air raid / bomb shelter.&nbsp; Hence yesterday's entry.

      Arses!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Help! &nbsp; I'm hiding in&nbsp;my office at the community centre but it's a bit like a goldfish bowl so it's a bit shit for hiding in.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I am still drunk from last night's adventures and everything is a bit surreal.&nbsp; I have that awful paranoia that everyone knows I'm wrecked, so not good.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Aw bugger, just caught a glimpse of my reflection in the glass - I think I'm pushing scruffy chic to the max today. &nbsp; And I have remnants of last nights glitter in inappropriate places. &nbsp; Eugh...&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Got a lovely surprise of Saturday afternoon when my beloved flatmate hollered for me from the sitting room.    Micheal Franti and Spearhead were on telly - playing at T in the Park!    (Just to put that into perspective, it's like telling me god is on telly!)  Fantastic, Amazing, Beautiful - the ex-spearience in three words!

      Last night I received 5 drunken text messages from my ex saying things along the lines of "I hate you" , "I'm starting to listen to my inner voice of suspicion I had about you all along" , "I hate you some more and I even hate your friends."  Nice to see he's dealing with things well and still managing to hold onto a little pride!  I mean really, is there any need?  I think not...

      Today I got new tattoo's and I just LOVE them!    I made the ultimate tattoo mistake of having my partners name inked on my arm when I was 19 and (even younger and even more foolish than I am now).    However me and said blokey split up the day before Chrimbo Eve, I know my timing is impeccable, and so I decided that 6 months into the split it was time to move on and get rid of the constant reminder of our failed relationship that I was carrying around on my arm.  So I now have a tribal crown with a green eye in it and a celtic symbol for eternity and the Levellers 'Rolling A' symbol below.  I'm gonna have a play with the digi cam over the weekend and so might post some piccies nest week.  So tonight this little wrong-un will be joining her wrong-un mates in an evening of dancing and alcohol misuse with a collection of brand spanking new tattoos to boot!  Fabtastico!

      Last night I watched a documentary that absolutely scared me silly!  So much so that when I got up for a wee in the night I had to switch all the lights on in every room before I entered it whilst en route to the bathroom.  Something I haven't had to do since I watched Silence of the Lambs and read 'The Birdman' by Mo Hayder!  It was about the man who murdered and cut up the prostitutes in Camden a couple of years ago.  Now usually I can cope with grisly stuff but there was something too real and frighteningly simple about this film that was shown last night.  They showed cctv footage of the guy dumping the body parts in wheelie bins on his estate as well as the real crime scene photos.  The guy is now serving 3 life sentences and is refusing to say what he did with the missing body parts and also why he did it...  Horrid, Horrid, Horrid.  Also last night I watched that new detective thing 55 degrees north.  Very, very funny for a geordie to watch!  There were some classically BAD accents.  So many of the actors sounded like they had been to an accent class run by that guy that does the voice over on Big Brother.  Not just that the geography was so mental - if you run to the end of Stowell St, aka China Town, you don't end up on the Quayside like they did last night - they're about a mile and half away from each other.  Oh and one of my lecturers that taught me at uni was on too - she was the witness's solicitor.  My flatmate calls her 'dog face' - something to do with a dodgy essay mark I think.  I also did some work on a new shirt that I am designing.  It's a pink vest with a girl with dreadlocks on it.  The dreads are loose though and made out of multicoloured french knitted lengths of wool / ribbon and thread.  This is not going to be a 'Mammoth Woolie' (the name of the jumpers I knit for charity)  I'm liking this one a lot and am going to keep it for myself.    My insomnia is also getting worse!  So far I have tried herbal and traditional medicines and nothing is working.  Grrrrrrr....  Answers on a postcard please.

      Well, I think I can congratulate myself on surviving another Monday.  Even if I did cheat slightly and not roll into work until gone lunch time.  Mind you, considering this weekends partying antics the fact that I am here at all is cause for celebration!  Yet again, I think I managed to consume the equivalent of my body weight in vodka on both Friday and Saturday nights...  Not big and not clever I know but 'Oh how we laughed!'  Friday night was spent meandering around Newcastle's pink triangle with my lovely friend M, who proposed several times over the course of the evening.  Sadly, I'm not gay but if I was then I'd surely marry her in an instant!  However I'm thinking that Newcastle's gay population must be totally minted to put up with the ludicrously steep prices in the bars in and around the 'Centre for Life'  Â£3.70 for a vodka and coke!  How mad is that???  Although I still managed to get squiffy enough to stumble on stage for the 'lesbian karaoke' to give an awesome rendition of 'No Woman No Cry' with M as my foxy 'wailer' backing dancer - Lav-leee!  Sorry to those of you that received drunken calls from me when I rolled home and decided it wasn't bed time - even though it was blatantly the middle of the night - you all know who you are and to those of you that were rudely awoken I hereby apologise and would like to say that I'll never do it again but you all know me better than that and it can't be guarranteed until my phone is fitted with a breathalizer!    Didn't get up until 7pm on Saturday.  Then went to a FANTASTIC night at the Cumberland Arms in Byker - Home Cooking - Great company from AG, as ever, the bands were sooooper and the late bar was jolly fine too.  And at only Â£3 entry - it's a bargain if ever I saw one!  Heaton was wet and dark on the way home and A was freaked by the number of snails out and about at 2am.  Luckily, I had my little pink torch to guide us home and save the snails from being squished.  Sunday morning found me aching all over and wishing that I had a spare set of vital organs on hand for such times...    Until such a time I followed the fail safe, self medicating tradition of cheese on toast, co-codamol and buckets of tea.  Rounded off with a couple of special cigarettes.  Ah, roll on Friday!

      I want to be a goose.  I read an article last night that expained a theory about why geese fly in a V formation.  It said that the goose in front, the one that leads the way if you like, creates a current and slip stream with it's wings that the two geese directly behind it get helped along by.  Then the other geese following the front three geese get helped along and so it goes on.  They take it in turns at being the leader.  And because they work together like this they can cover 71% more ground (or air maybe, coz they're in the sky) than they could if they flew alone.   AND if one goose gets tired or sick, then two other geese accompany it down to rest and recover and then when it's better the three of them all fly off together and join the rest of the flock, able to catch up because they can do the slipstream working with each other trick.   And because they do this they get to have summer all year round because they can fly to wherever it's sunny, anywhere in the world!  Like maybe they wake up one day in Canada and think ' oooh it's getting a bit parky innit?  Let's us all be off to Africa where it's nice and warm'   And off they go.  So when I grow up, I want to be a goose.

       urlLink    Errrr...  I have no idea how this injury was sustained, only that it happened on Friday between the hours of 9pm and 5am.  I have no memory of what happened between these times (which may be a good thing?) but anyone kind enough to set me straight will win a prize - ta! xxx&nbsp; urlLink

      Blinkety flip - Is it Friday again already???  Last Friday was rather stupendous as I spent the evening with my lovely bendy friend T - she's a yoga teacher don'tcha know! Anyhoo we got rather squiffy round at hers and then she sent me off into the garden to harvest lavender for her to sell at a flower show market thingy she was doing the following day. It was great.  I had a whale of a time happily pruning her sweet smelling bush in the moonlight. (oooh er!)  Then S came over with promises of doing something exciting with a trout, but by the time he arrived none of us were capable of any kind of trout handling so we had to dial out for food. Easy enough you might think. Well, yes, under normal circumstances there would be no problem. However, that night I had noticed that T had said the word 'Chicken Kebab' a lot!. I think I was noticing it even more through my fuzzy haze of squiffeyness because usually T is very veggie. Anyhoo, that night T was positive she wanted said 'Chicken Kebab.' And some bright spark decided that the responsibility of food ordering would be left to me. Not a very good plan under the circumstances because as I dialed the number, I was suddenly hit by the hilarity of the word 'Chicken Kebab' and I realised that there was NO way I was going to be able to speak to a person in the straight outside world AND say the funniest words I had ever heard, without turning into a guffawing baboon. But it was too late! The nice outside world lady had answered and was asking me things! And no matter how hard my rational and by this point very hungry self told me to 'hold it together hippy' my anarchic wasted side just wouldn't listen! So poor outside world lady just got me saying 'Yes' * giggle*  'Can I please hahahahve a Chik heheheh - OH BOLLOCKS!' * hang up fall to the ground laughing*  Finally T came to the rescue and did manage to place the order with only a few muted giggles (whilst me and S snorted with hilarity in the background) and we were saved from starvation.  Full of food and wine and things we rounded off the evening with a good old sing song and games of charades. Bloody Hippies...
