						   I hate the theatre, and yet it seems I'm somehow attracted to personalities that thrive on living drama in their daily lives.  It seems strange to me that stabability should seek whimsy; I think I'm going to throw myself into inevitable insanity one of these days...  Signing off, M.

						   "If two lovers can still remain friends, they were never truly in love...  Or they still are."  Certainly explains the hostility between Satan and I, doesn't it?     Signing off, M.

						   Wow, yesterday was so boring I didn't even blog anything.  Today I just sat at home watching the Olympics until like 4:15 when I drove myself into church.  When I got home Dad and I went to eat at Monical's because the girls are out of town...  The problem was that I then got forced to drive Dad to the goddamn concession stand at the football game where I was stuck for way too long...  Not like I had anything to do at home anyway, but still, I would rather have been home.  Anyway...  Signing off, M.

						   I went driving all by my lonesome to **censored name**'s today...  Aren't I proud?  We went to Pizza Hut and dropped off my application and also picked up a blank tape at Pamida for my mom.  Then we went back to his house and played lots of Age of Mythology before I had to go back home...  That's pretty much it.  Signing off, M.

						   Wow... **censored name** wished me a happy birthday about fifteen minutes ago... That's really strange. We haven't talked in months... REALLY, REALLY STRANGE. Should I re-emphasize a point here? STRANGE!!! With a capital fucking S! Very strange... Signing off, M.

						   Yay! I got my license today! Oh, and I picked up an application from Pizza Hut, which I'm going to have to drop off sometime tomorrow. I'm so happy about getting my license for some reason. But I'm sad too, because dear 'ol **censored name** got nervous and didn't get her license today... I came into the DMV today just as she was getting out, and I felt so bad for her. I really hope she gets online so I can play healer again... So ironic that I'm the one that gets thrust into that role, is it not? Yet, it seems that people with problems are drawn to me. Anyway, enough of my life calling garbage... Signing off, M.

						   Well, today was boring. It consisted of me driving around in **censored town** running errands with the girls, driving with my dad tonight to get his damn license lecture, and the Cubs losing. Big fun. Oh well, I get my license tomorrow!! Yay!! Signing off, M.

						   Wow, I'm e-mailing stuff directly onto my blog... I'm so easily amused, aren't I? Anyway, talkin' to **censored name** now. She got a cell phone today, so she's pretty happy, even if she's mad at me, which I think she is. She said I could stop by her house on Wednesday, though, so it's all cool. **Censored name** was asking what I did to her earlier tonight too... But then **censored name** denied bein' mad at me, so I'm kinda confused. Oh well. I'm having too much fun blogging via e-mail! Signing off, M.

						   Today I experimented with the LiveIM thingy on my phone... It seems pretty cool. I think I wanna get a text messaging plan, which I've already been told I have to pay for. Not like this is a problem, since I'm applying at Pizza Hut once I get my license. Speaking of that, it's TWO DAYS from now (less than, actually)! Oh, and I wished good ol' **censored name** a happy 16th today. I hope she gets online later tonight... I haven't like really talked to her since the Six Flags trip, which has been a while. No one's online right now, though... So sad... Signing off, M.

						   TWO DAYS UNTIL MY LICENSE!!! YES!!! Oh, and it's **censored name**'s birthday today. I already sent her an e-mail wishing her a happy 16th. I think she's still a little mad at me, which is upsetting. **Censored name**'s a great friend, I really hope she appreciates the e-mail within the first hour of her b-day. I wanna go visit her when I get my license, so we have to be on good terms again. Anyway, that's all for now... Signing off, M.

						   First, I have to make my disclaimer... This a joke, not to be taken seriously.   Now to the possible obituary for my annoying sister...  **Censored name** died far from the comforts of her own house today. She was at her grandmother's, picking up sticks out while riding a golf cart. Since she pissed off M. too many times, M. slammed the brakes and turned suddenly, throwing her from the cart and crushing her skull. Her nosy, bitchy behavior will be missed, to be sure.

						   I have to go to **censored town** tomorrow, which really pisses me off. If we could just wait until next weekend, I would be able to take my own car and visit **censored name** in **censored town** since it's close to **censored town**. But noooooo, my father is annoying like that. Oh well... Signing off, M.

						            Greg Maddux of the Chicago Cubs picked up his 300th win today against the San Francisco Giants in SBC Park.  It wasn't a typical Maddux outing in that he only pitched five innings, giving up four runs on seven hits with three walks.  Yet it seems fitting that the great competitor Maddux would have to struggle his way to the great 300 win milestone.  It is even more fitting that he should pick up his #300 with the same team he picked up #1.  Maybe the most fitting is that he could be the last 300 game-winner in the history of the game.  His former teammate Tom Glavine is the only remaining player with a chance to get there, and the evolution of the game indicates that no future pitcher will ever achieve this great milestone.  So "Mad Dog" Maddux has achieved a great milestone with a fastball topping out around 85; most say he made his career out of astonishing command.  He may have this, but what he's made a career out of is having guts - being a tenacious competitor.  Congratulations to you, Greg Maddux!   -M.

						   I got a new toy!  Yay!  We went to True Value today (there's a Radio Shack in it) and got my new cell phone.  It's an LG4600, which is basically an upgrade of mi madre's LG4400.  I didn't think I was gonna get it for another few days when I turn 16 and get my happy little license.  I'm busy going crazy trying to put everyone in my contacts now, though; I'm kinda alternating between the keyboard and the phone keypad at the moment.  LOL!  Anyway, back to the cell...
