      Well, I'm not sure exactly how it happened, why it happened, or what I was thinking when it happened, but it turns out I'm going to prom people. Break open the non-alcolohic sparkling grape juice.  I debated the whole thing for a quite a while. You know, we're not exactly close friends, but we're certainly not enemies (so i would hope). The more important thing was the ridiculous costs. But, I swallowed all that and finally asked her, so I'm excited. It should be fun, and she's a great girl. Line from Guys and Dolls: "She's a beautiful doll alright, with one-hundred percent eyes."  In related news (related to quote) the pit sounds really good; it should be a great show. Except for one nameless character. One of the music teachers said after this person sang "is it too late for me to return my tickets." Don't let that discourage you; i may be bad, but everyone else is much better.  I hope you all realize i was kidding about that last sentence.  I have to write an essay for bio that i'm not ready for, and study blindly for a test in bio that i'll never be ready for...stupid independent study.

      Well, I wasn't going to post today, I was just going to skip it, but i was down here doing other things so I thought "Hey, what the heck...I could really go for some kidney beans...I'll post before I go to bed." My mind is a little random at times, especially late at night.  Here is one of my favorite random thoughts. I was in APUS last year, just sitting there minding my own business when BOOM! a random thought hit me. I leaned over to Katie Morrison and said, "Wouldn't it be great if a teacher purposely held onto the attendence until the hall monitor knocked on the door. Then, the teacher opens the door, says 'I'm sorry, just a minute,' and the hall monitor walks into the room. Then, the teacher, once her path is clear, makes a break for the door with the attendence slips." Imagine it: teachers running through the hallway Dave Starsky style gripping the attendence. Add to it the element of them yelling "Hahaha! You'll never get my attendence you insignificant little hall monitors! Hahaha!" And there is complete Kaos, with a kapital k.  Of course, this whole online attendence thing completely ruins that. My dream of seeing teachers running away with the attendence may never materialize. C'est la Vie.  Hey, musical tickets go on sale next Monday. Whoohoo. Guys and Dolls. Come see Tony, Joe, Sarah, Robin, Katie, Katie, Kait, a few more Katherines, and all the gang. It should be the best time you have ever had at any event in your life (I'm required to say that in my contract).

      I just thought I'd be a little random. I was at school, and I thought of a fun little post. And, I've got a great random idea coming up in the future, so hold on to your seats for that one. Katie Morrison, you know what I'm talking about.  So, I was in the bathroom at school, something I rarely do I (i think like 30 times since Kindergarten), and i realized there's a big problem that needs to be solved. Now, ladies, I don't know obviously if you encounter this problem, but we boys certainly do. There is a 8.746% chance that there will be a clean stall open. 8.746!  Here's the problem, and i just don't understand it. Sometimes, the toilets are filled with urine and feces, and that just creeps me out, so there's no way I'm using that. Others, have wet spots all over the place, on the floor, on the seat, on toilet paper. And then there are stalls that just have toilet paper strewn all over the place? Why do we guys have to be rude, potty-mouth, dirty, slobs?  As long as I'm talking bathrooms, I have two bathroom pet peeves: #1) Bathroom doors should push from the inside. Do you know how many people don't wash their hands? Almost all bathrooms pull from the inside, so you have to grip a grimy handle. That's illogical. #2) Hotels that have bathroom sinks in a separate room from the toilet and shower. So you have to open the door with your germy hands and wash them. Again, illogical.  Well, that's enough of that.  Random Factoid: Prom would run about $250, $125 if split with a date, which is uncomfortable. Why am I thinking about this so much? I truly don't know.

      A few months ago, I recieved a scholarship for Hillsdale. I called everyone I knew to tell them i got a full scholarship. Then I read the fine print and realized I hadn't, not at all. So that fall was painful.  But yesterday, after I posted, I went through my folder of NU stuff, and I found a financial aid offer. Since all my teachers told me NU doesn't give money, I was highly skeptical. Not wanting to jump to conclusions, I read it over and over and over and over. Then I started running around my house, jumping on furniture, and screaming like a little girl. I won't tell you how much it is, but it's substantial...quite substantial...like 96% substantial.  So today's been a great day. I ruled out Northwestern months ago because of the money and unlikelihood of getting in. But here it is, the things I so wanted in a college. Cheap, prestigious, close to home (that one's very important...i need my family). So, I'm pretty sure the Michigan schools are out, wildcats are in.  My only reservation is its size. I really wanted a small school. And a Big 10 experience is quite different from a small school. But, the positives are awfully positive.  Anyway, my day was spent today doing a boatload of homework, watching the Cubs game, playing basketball with my sister (no, i didn't lose), and watching the finale of Dream Job on ESPN...my guy from Glen Ellyn won...he was certainly the best.  Random Factoid: My Gateway monitor has the letters OSD on it, and i don't know what that means  Pip PIp.

      Alright, I just want to make it clear that I'm not trying to be showy or bragging or anything, cuz i always worry that people will think that. I'm just extremely excited and I wanted to tell the world, but please don't be offended  The mail came an hour ago (which is a whole nother story...that i'll tell you mid sentence to leave you in suspense...8 months ago our mailwoman of 7 years was relocated...since then we have had a variety of mailmen, but they all deliver the mail at 3:30....our mail used to come at 10:30...i understand that someone has to get the mail at 3:30, but if you are used to getting the mail at 10:30, someone else must be used to getting it at 3:30, so why switch things around? Just follow the same schedule as your predecessor) and I got an acceptance letter from Northwestern! I'm ecstatic.  I probably won't go there, though, cuz they're way too expensive and they're the only school to offer me no financial aid as of yet. Still, it's incredibly exciting. I hope all of you have gotten into great schools that you've wanted to be accepted to and I hope you were as excited as I am when you recieved your letter.  Random Factoid: For Burkee: an official linguist from Harvard University wrote that "illinois" is native american in basic root origin, but it was taken and adjusted by the French. Technically, it should be prounounced "illonwa." However, midwestern culture has typically prounounced it "illanoy." Neither accepted prounounciation uses the "s" at the end. "Illanoise" is usually said by people far from the state or gangsters (ie Big Jule in Guys and Dolls")  Pip Pip!

      The afternoon was fun. Spent the whole time working on government commercials. Definitely a good time.  Since it's Friday and Lent, I had eggsalad for supper. And as I was peeling lettuce for the sandwich, I realized that lettuce is one of the wierdest things in the world. Think about it. 1) It's name is lettuce. How many other words ending in "uce" are pronounced "us?" What does it come from? More importantly, just say the word, slowly and with deep thought. LETTUCE. Isn't it a strange word? 2) It's both green and white, and there's really no rhyme or reason to the coloration. It's not just like the stubby part is white. Sometimes, you get a very dark (or vibrant, not really dark, because dark is more of a forest green and I'm definitlely talking about a bright green) piece, and other times it's so light that it's almost white. Why? 3) It's shape and structure is the wierdest thing of all. Do you just dig into it like an apple? Do you cut it like a canteloupe? No, you peel it, but not like you peel an orange. Some of the pieces are long and wind all the way around, so you have to cut the piece...it can't be circular. Others are really small and tear apart too easily. Also, you can never follow a straight tear...it's always ridged and without design. Lettuce is the wierdest vegetable on earth, weirder than the rutabaga...at least i know how to eat a rutabaga.  That was an excerpt from the new Broadway musical, opening in June, entitled "Mortonson's Rant," a sequel to "Mortonson's Lament."  Random Factoid: Coca-Cola made 50 international beanbags in their first bean bag series, with batches of 10 being released every four-five months. Each beanbag was an animal native to a different Coke drinking country. For instance, there was a mongoose (which is neither a man or a goose) from Pakistan with a coke bottle in its hand.

      I am posting tonight via the 6th connection to AOL. I connected once, it froze...connected a second time, it froze...you see where I'm going? That's 6 phone calls? You know how much money that costs? You know how much I could get at a garage sale with all that? (btw, the first garage sales will be opening in a few weeks...if you'd like to join me in a walk of some 50 house block sale, let me know...it'll be a good time, good time)  Spent today planning for government commercials that we'll be filming tomorrow: Eric Hoffman vs. Ryan Morton, Republican vs. Reactionary (we like to give the American people a whole spectrum to choose from). Some campy advertising techniques being put into play. I even roped my three little sisters in to it (named Martha, Abigail, and Betsy for historical significance). Plus, I'm leasing myself to Heneghan's group for the old "America First" campaign, aka Mortonson's neo-nonracist-Nazis.

      Well, we've reached the halfway point of our much needed Spring vacation. It's time to look back at how we've spent those days. ... ... ... Well, that was fun.  You know what one of those simple joys is that we all should appreciate? Rolling our necks. Now, I'm not talking about the ability to do so, although that's very important too...I like seeing things on the side of me. But what I'm talking about is just the relaxing and spirit-lifting feeling you get from rolling your neck, hopefully cracking a few "neck-knuckles" (say that 5x fast). All of you, sit back and roll your necks to the right a few times, then to the left a few more...Don't you feel better? Ah.......Back cracking is also a great reviver...the desks at school are wonderful for back cracking. You can either do "the twist" or you can do "the push." The first is just twisting your back as far as you can, while the second is pushing all your weight to the back of the chair and feeling one of those spiny-disk-thingies cracking. Oh what a glorius sensation.  Well, that's enough of that.  Happy Birthday to my dear friend Joe Macaluso. He's the big one-eight.  Also, a belated birthday greeting to Christy...sorry I didn't mention it in my blog on day one (March 21...she is also 18...whoohoo)  Random Factoid: Andrew Mellon, Fatty Arbuckle, Thomas Dewey (a republican...just threw in that VALUABLE adjective), and Steve McQueen were born on March 24.

      Alright, so technically it's Day 4, but I have very limited access to the internet...I don't even know my own password (which makes this blog thing even more fun...my parents have no idea...hehehe...aren't I a regular renegade)  Shane: thanks to your encouragement, I'll start telling stories...as of yet, I have none, though. You mentioned Chaucer...wouldn't it be cool to finish his tales? There's only like 80 left. How hard could it be to write everyhing in couplets? Pretty darn difficult, but a team of us could pull it off. We could even cheat, and midway through the stories "the Host" can change his mind and decide stories will only be told during the trip there, not the return trip. That's only like 20 more then...let's get on that. Sometime between now and our deaths. Anyone who's game, let me know. 20 people equals 20x the profit, or something like that.  Anyway, my day today was like all my other days: pointless, futile, dull, and just how I like it.

      Good Ev-oh-ning.  I'm wondering what the next big step mortonson wil take could be. I quickly defied the odds with a blog and a tag, but I need more, otherwise I lose the shock factor and I go back to being a nothing. Like Andy Kaufman, always needed to do something else. Please, if you have suggestions, tag the board, if you will.  Still new to this whole updating thing...I'd like to tell funny random stories like Shane, cuz Shane's a great guy. But I don't thing I've reached that point of my online relationship yet. So, I'll just recap my day. Woke up at 11:30 (springbreak is marvelous), watched Days of Our Lives (there is a serial killer who's killing all the great old characters...I highly recommend you start watching, 1:00 on NBC), watched a movie that is slipping my mind right now (must have been good), and then I played wiffleball in the backyard with my sisters. I broke one as it soared over our house...if Schaumburg's baseball team used wiffleballs, pitched them underhand, and gave me 10 strikes instead of 3, I think I'd be a shoe-in for a bench-player.

      It's astounding how quickly things travel across the www. I told 4 people that I had a blog, and suddenly everyone knows. As exciting as it is for me to know I was mentioned by other people, it did kinda take the fun out of telling people. On the other hand, it was really exciting to see kp, burkee, and heneghan on the tagboard...certainly wasn't expeting that.  In other news, it is officially 1:00am, so I have beaten masca so far: 2 days of posting in a row. My goals are awfully pitiful. I should be thinking about you know deciding on college and getting scholarships, and here i am excited that i've posted three times in 12 hours.  It turns out that that vase that broke was a crystal wedding present for my parents, 18 years ago...that smarts.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to get addicted to this whole posting thing...You may read posts in a few weeks/days/hours of my saying "hey, I changed the radio station today at 11:41am, and I think i'll do it again at 11:44am." Yeah, that'd be pretty pathetic.  Random Factoid: The only 16 seed to up-end a 1 seed in the NCAA tourny was Harvard, in the Woman's NCAA tourny.  Pip Pip

      You ever think about the little things that you 20 minutes later you wish you hadn't done? It's just funny to think about the chain reaction.  Let's say, hypothetically, you're three year old sister, let's say her name is Sage, wants a bottle. So you leave your room to give her a bottle, never imagining what the final disaster of that action will be.  So you go to the kitchen, and her bottle is no where to be found. You search her bedroom, the livingroom, your parents' bedroom, and no bottle. Ironic thing is that she has three of them, and they're all missing!  So finally, so give up and say "Here, Sage, I'm gonna let you be a big girl and drink water from a cup. Now you be careful" (If you think you know where this is going, you're wrong).  So you sit her on the bench, and walk away. She then calls you back, and tells you to look out the window. You look out another window, and tell her you see the bird (which is of course a lie to get her off your back) but that's not good enough. She wants you to look out her window. So you do.  But she knows you don't see it, so what does she do? She points to it.  In doing so, she knocks down an empty vase that was on the table and it shatters to pieces.  All because you couldn't find one of her three bottles.  My question: Why keep an empty vase on a table?  Random Factoid: The capital of Burkina Faso is Ougadougu.  Pip Pip.

      Well, here I am, bloggin' it up on the ol' world wide web. Not really sure why i'm here, since I loathe technology and know that only 1.5 people will actually read this, but meh(kudos to tony for his borrowed expression).  So I'm obviously new to this whole scene, but I'm relatively excited about it (thank you Gagan for leading me here, and Joe for helping me...pathetic, isn't it?). My goal is to post more often than masca, a lofty (note sarcasm) but honorable goal.  I think I'd also like to add a little Mortonson flavor to the blogspot. Every post, I will include a random bit of trivia that I hope you enjoy.  Today's trivia: "Thinking Things Over With Calvin Coolidge" was actually the column Coolidge wrote for a Boston paper after he retired.  Pip Pip.

      I'm getting a little sluggish on the updating people.  You've gotta keep me in line...if anyone even reads this anymore.  This 5 day weekend, this so called Spring Break II...psh...it's nothing but a 5 day weekend of work...they give it to us and think they're so nice, but it's the weekend before AP tests...none of us have time to really enjoy the weekend...Dirty devils.  So, I'm down to 5 tests...I remember thinking in 8th grade i'd be taking 8 tests senior year...hah.  I'm not in Calc and I wimped out of Bio. I would need a 5, and i'm not getting that. I need 5s on Lit, Lang, Macro, and Gov, but i think i stand a better chance at those...hopefully i'll get a 5 on two of them...then there's Stats, where I only need a 4.  In other news, i'm running a scholastic bowl tournament for jr. high kids tomorrow, bright and early...I'm trying to leave my mark...I want posterity to speak of Ryan Morton...maybe this will continue for years, and I'll be the one who started it.  I so desperately want to be remembered. I fear being forgotten.   I also fear death, not my own, but those of other people. You know, I could deal with my own death, cuz I wouldn't be there anymore, but I could I get over someone else dying? I'm lucky enough to still have all my grandparents...the closest deaths were of my Great-Uncle and a classmate in 8th grade, who I wasn't too close to.  In randomity, does anyone else hate that scratchy material on some bookbags? I'm not sure if it's vinyl or nylon or whatever, but for years it's annoyed me. If anyone scratches it, even feet away, I get chills down my spine. Even putting my finger on it makes me feel uncomfortable...someone else please tell me you feel this way too.  4/30 = They play tonight in St. Louey...start of another rivalrous season.

      I felt like talking about my sister today. And by sister, I mean Sarah, the oldest, 13 year-old.  Basically, the idea struck me after I heard about her first softball game of the season, which was today...i couldn't attend because of newspaper deadline, and that's a blasted shame: she allowed 5R in 4innings (maximum is 20R...5R is amazing at her level), and struck out over 3 batters per inning (the catchers can't catch her, so the batters to go to first)...this amazes me, because she has always been a decent pitcher, with speed, but never any control...in the winter, she not only developed accuracy, but also changed from speed to flaming velocity.  On top of this, she has never been a good hitter. A lot of strikouts, very little power. She was 3-4 today. And I missed it.  Why am I talking about my sister, you ask?  Well, so am I...why the heck would I be talking about her to you guys...she doesn't know this exists and you don't know her.  I hope I didn't take up too much of your time  4/26 = Last time I checked, my favorite pitcher, Randy Johnson, was crushing the Cubs 7-0. Zambrano was terrible in his return to the desert (almost a no-no last time) but he did get the first hit through 5 innings off of the Big Unit.

      How much would you pay for lunch with Principal Sharon Cross at Magiano's? I would pay $3.50, which I did, along with 5 other seniors. What a steal...what should we talk about? Maybe it will be after graduation...that would be glorious.  The auction dance was rather dull...really dull. A whole lot of items went for really low prices, while some stupid people paid extravagant amounts of cash on Cubs tickets...don't get me started. The socializing for 30 minutes was fun (got my groove on), but the auction fun only lasted 40 minutes...then the auction boredome went on for 2 hours. But, I had a relatively good time, until the end when I stuck my foot in my mouth and made a completely embarassed fool out of myself. If you want to know more, talk to me. If I like you, I'll tell you. If I don't like you, don't talk to me.  My random thought just struck me: why does AOL say "You've got mail"? That annoys the crap out of me! The "got" is totally unnecessary; it's redundant. Of course you got what you have, or vice versa. Though "got" can't stand on its own, "have" can, and should. It should be "You have mail." There, much better.  4/23 = Maddux "has got" his first WIN as a Cub since 1992. It's his 290th on the 90th anniversary of Wrigley Field's first game. Whoohoo. Don't pay $740 for 6 tickets...boo!

Tuesday, I spent the day and night at Northwestern. AWESOME! I'm definately going there next year...should be a good time. So is Erin Daly...don't really talk to her much, but she's going, so it's someone I know...  Wednesday, I rushed back from Evanston to participate in Knowledgmaster...we did fairly well...glad I was there.  The NHS meeting that night was amazing! Yay to Conservatism and debate, that's all I have to say about that.  I can't believe AP tests start in 4 school days! That's ridiculous!

      Yesterday was really a good day, in all respects. There were a few things that bothered me, but mostly it was a fun day.  It began with Joe, Dietz, Christy, Stephanie, Natalie, Lauren, and I going to the NISPA conference. After presenting a session on the Back Page, we "hung out"...I really enjoyed myself and I hope everyone else did too. Sure, we won very few individual awards (kudos to masca for his blue ribbon) and we only got silver, and Fremd got the Golden Eagle, but it was still a pleasant morning/afternoon.  Then, I went home to see quite possibly the best Cubs game ever! This is an exaggeration. See below for more details.  The musical was excellent last night. This has really been fun...I haven't gotten into it as much as last year, but I've enjoyed being with these people. And after thinking it over, kudos to Andy for doing a much better job last night on "Sit Down"...it was really a huge improvement.  I'm going to miss working with these people...I didn't think I would...but I will  Then we went to Applebees...nothing exciting there, just a good time.  Here's my random comment. I was thinking about string last week and was going to post about it, but I forgot (ironic, isn't it...string around your finger?) Christy helped me remember at NISPA (and then came up with that funny irony bit)...Anyway, have you ever noticed that string is really a bunch of strings intertwined? For instance, the piece I'm holding in my hand is actually made of about 5 strands I would say. Of course, then, that's made up of strands...my question is, if the whole thing is a piece of string, what do you call the strings that make it? Stringettes? Stringlies? Strins? It's a puzzlement.  4/16 = What do you get when you have Aramis Ramirez bat after Moises Alou? Back to back HRs three times this year, in only 10 games. Ramirez also had 5RBI, was 4-4, and had a double. The whole game, the Cubs were losing, at one point 9-4. Just as they started chipping away at the lead, the Reds scored more runs. One of those "chippers" was Todd Hollansworth, pinch-hitting, hitting a 2run HR. He has 3 hits on the season, all are HRs, and 2 are PH. So, going into the bottom of the 9th, Danny Graves, the Reds closer, tried to preserve a 10-9 lead. Sammy had other ideas: He had ideas of tying Ernie Banks on the all-time Cubs HR list, which he did. Remember that Alou was part of back-back HRs earlier? He did it again. Very next batter, a sweet swinging Walk Off HR: 11-10 VICTORY.  Random Factoid: A large drink at Applebees costs $1.69  Pip Pip

      I realized that these blogs are dangerous things. Blogger.com might as well just put a gun in my hand. People who blog typically just rant and rave about their depressing lives...I promise I'll stop that...it may come back, because i do live a depressing life, but it won't stay for long.  So, two random thoughts came to me today. Usually, I would just give you one and hold the other for your birthday (yes, your birthday) but I thought I'd treat you to an early present. You really are a lucky duck.  #1: Possibly one of the best smells is that of a wet paper towel. I dont' really think brand matters, but the fluffy Bounty is probably the best, though there's only Mardi Gras at my house, so that's all I can experience. But really, you hold a wet paper up to your nose, and it's sensually calming (don't know if sensual was really the right word...but it got the point across)  #1a: I just thought of this one. Actually, I thought of it in 8th grade, but it just hit me again. I believe you can tell a person's personality based upon their purchase of paper products. For instance, my mom is a cold, harsh person with very little sympathy for things: she buys kleenex, mardi gras, and Scott toilet paper. My grandma on the other hand is a sweeter, calmer, loving person who buys Puffs, Bounty, and Charmin. The former are rough and irritating to the skin, while the latter is smooth and creamy. Try it out...what paper items do you buy?  #2: I heard ambulence sirens earlier, and I decided if I were to die, I wouldn't want my enemies at my wake or funeral. Not because I disliked them but because they disliked me. You know, you hear about people saying great things about you after you're gone when they really never believed. Stay true to yourself. If you don't like someone alive, don't like them dead.  That's all. Come see Guys and Dolls. Should be fun.  4/15: A risky off-season move in Michael Barrett is paying dividends as he hit 2HRs in today's game. Zambrano made another great start, but this time got the win, a 10-5 VICTORY over the Pirates.  Pip Pip!

      You see, I tried to post the first one, but it said it didn't work...so i did it again...and again...and again the next day...I apologize for the reptititiveness...repetititititveness...repetitititititivenes  Anyway, I have a math equation for you all: 6AP tests + musical + AP homework + family commitments + Sextant = depression for Ryan.  Every year, April is a terrible month for me. Sophomore year, it was the ol' gifted project...I nearly died...Last year, it was musical and newspaper piled on top of each other...this year it's AP tests, musical, newspaper, and college stuff...I thought 02 would be my worst year...it only goes down from here.  I decided I'm in a mid-life crisis, which means I'll live til about the ripe age of 34. I have all the signs: I'm sick of the things I'm doing, I'm sick of the people I'm with, I'm sick of the society I live in, and I'm sick of how my life has turned out after 17 years. I'm figuring "this too shall pass," but if it doesn't, my years will slowly tick away...I think I feel an ulcer forming right now...nah...it's probably just a tapeworm...what a relief.  So, basically, if I seem completely out of it this month, or next month, or anytime you see me, it's not that I'm sliding, it's not that I'm mad at you, and it's not that I'm PMSing...I'm just depressed.  4/12 = Home Opener + Maddux's Return + Terrible Interdivision Team = Humiliating Loss. That's all I have to say. 13-2 DEFEAT handed to the Cubs by the Pirates.  Random Factoid: Sally Field has played Abbie Lockhart's mother on ER. She is a manic-depressive, and acts quite well.

      There comes a point in posting, where you can't post anymore...that's where i'm at. I have no ideas for random stuff.  But you know, you can't plan randomity. It just has to hit you, like 16,000 pounds of bananas...  Or 1,200 boxcars filled with elephants and rhinorceroses (or is it rhinoceri...not sure...)...  Or 67 trucks filled with bowling balls...  Or two submarines filled with solid lead...  Or one Andy Mo...nah, that'd be mean...  I tried posting this yesterday, but it was acting weird, so i lost it...I'm trying to recreate the glory that was...  Let's see, next I said:  "Happy Easter, and if you don't believe in Easter, Happy Easter"  Then:  "I'm adding a new feature to my posts. I call it the Daily Cubs Recap, because it recaps the Cubs game of the day. ENJOY! In the spirit of the above comment, if you're a Sox fan, ENJOY!"  Then I recapped the game, but I'll use today's instead.  4/11 = On the day Christ rose from the dead, the Cubs listless offense also was rejuvinated. Backing up a 1R outing by Kerry Wood, the Cubs scored 10 runs, including homers by Corey, Barrett, Alou, and a PHHR by Gonzo. The final score in Atlanta was 10-2.

      Ironically, I've just taken a nap. However, my post relates to the past few days. I mentioned how I've been getting to bed late, rising early, and laying awake in bed for at least an hour every night.  Why? I'm a senior. I shouldn't have worries, I should be getting the best sleep of my life.  The only things I should be concerned about, I'm not. I haven't started thinking about AP tests, and I could care less (no, i couldn't) about the musical.  I stay up with random thoughts about the little things in my life i need to accomplish.  Most of my lying awake thoughts are about saying goodbye to people. I don't want to. I know that once I'm in college I'll have just as good friends as I do now. My friendships I decided are cyclical, none of them lasting. I've spent four years developing school friendships, but nothing beyond that. So I'll go to college and I'll create another series of 4-year friendships. Maybe when I have a career, along with job stability will be friend stability.  That's the type of stuff I think about.  Something else I've contemplated: Why is it, with so many attractive (I'm going to use girls, because I'm a guy) girls around, we guys typically find ourselves attracted to just one. I mean, there are many girls who we know are attractive/beautiful/etc., yet we are really only attracted to one person, before even knowing their personality. What makes one pretty girl more attractive than another? It's like that whole soul mate deal. What is the first thing that makes you forget the other girls and focus in on just one? I imagine the same thing applies vice versa (but not criss-crossed, if you know what I mean...)  And then sometimes (or every night) I fantasize my life in another time and place (this is when I'm still awake and relatively sane, mind you). For instance, one of my long running fantasies is that I own the Cubs. My first action was to fire all the real players because they make too much. What I did was then hired a bunch of my classmates (if you're reading this, you're probably on the team). None of them have experience, so we obviously didn't win the world series in our first season...we lost in the NLDS. After 10 seasons, though, we have been in 7 world series and won 5 of them. I have won 3 Cy Young awards and 4 MVP awards...if you want more indepth statistics, just let me know. I've got them all up here (i am pointing to my head).  I also daydream about saving animals in the Savannah, going on covert ops in warehouses, and fighting in World War III (using civil war weaponry). The common theme, ironically, is that there are always 7 friends. I LOVE order and logic and organization and storylines, so all of my fantasies are very indepth. I spend more time working on characterization and history than I actually spend on the fantasy part.  I am quite possilby the weirdest and most pathetic individual in the world.  I've now depressed myself.  I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time (...cellophane, mr. cellophane...)

      This is the drill for the next two weeks, before a much need Spring Break II.  Get up at 6am, go to school, doze off during AP Bio, go to musical rehearsal (deadline the week after that), get home at about 8:30pm, try to futiley do my homework, fall asleep in my chair until 11pm, load my bladder with soda pop, scribble words on my homerwork, go to bed at 1am, and fall asleep at 2:30am  And repeat.  So why am I blogging when I could be sleeping?  I don't know...not exactly smart on my part...i hope you appreciate it...I'd better make it worth it.

      It's true...I apologize...the streak is over.  Here's the deal, though. I was online Saturday, creating a nice little 2 Week Anniversary Post, and then I clicked "preview you post." But since I'm an AOL Mature Teen, there are restrictions everynow and then on what I can view online. For example, sometimes I can't see KP's or Shane's website because it's blocked. Other times, they are not, which really confuses me. Anyway, AOL blocked me from previewing, and then I couldn't refresh, so I lost my post, and being the stubborn individual that I am, I quit.  Then I boycotted the blogspot for Sunday.  But now, regretting the end of my streak, I'm back in action, ready to go beyond 14 days.  But, since I'm a sentimental guy who loves to look into the past, here are some highlights from the two weeks that were.  - I beat Masca in posting...beat him by 13 days - Why leave an empty vase on a table? - Turns out I'm a soap opera fan...go ahead and laugh, if you haven't already - We all enjoyed a rare soundbite from our 30th President - Anyone want to help write those Canterbury Tales? - "It's time to look back at how we've spent those days... ... ... Well, that was fun" - The simple joys of back cracking and neck rolling - I Loathe AOL (sound familiar) - Lettuce is the weirdest thing in the world - My mail comes at the late time of 3:30, as does Shane's (thank you tagboard) - I will be attending Northwestern. Yay! - There is an 8.746% chance of finding a clean stall in a bathroom - Bathroom doors should push out, not in - Guys and Dolls will be great, with the exception of just one person - Teachers should run away with attendence slips - I love kidney beans - I'm going to prom with Hayley...should be a wonderful evening - I have 200% blood - My favorite names for my children will be Harrison and Reagan (both republicans of course) - A lot of great people got into a lot of great schools  Wow...i'm really bad at this posting thing...the past 2 weeks have been terrible...maybe it was good that i stopped for 2 days...maybe I need to stop longer...looking back at my pathetic attempts to be funny, I apologize to the online community.  Well, this weekend was very enjoyable: went bowling, got hair cut, sang in church choir, visited grandparents...all around nice weekend.

      Yep, don't want to miss a day's post.  So, I'll just talk about something random. (I love randomity)  A bunch of seniors picked up Germans from the airport this afternoon. And it made me think. Why is it a "German" but it's not a "French?" Both describe a culture, like the German culture or the French culture, but only German can be used alone as a person. The same difference exists between "Italian" and "English" So odd. Other contrasts: "Norwegian" and "Swedish"..."Polish" and "Russian"..."Chinese" and "Korean"...well, i find it odd...it interests me.  Here's another nationality thing that I really get upset about...maybe some of you can answer it...though, in the past, when I ask you for an answer or opinion, I rarely get one...but I'll give it a go again.  I am 25% German, 12.5% French, 12.5% Austrian, 12.5% Norwegian, and 37.5% Swedish. That's a grand total of 100%. Most of all of us can do that sort of thing.  But here's the quandry.  Let me give you a hypothetical situation. Let's say I move to England (why, I don't know...I like scones and i like saying "pip pip"). In England, I marry a pureblood Englishwoman. All her blood is English, 100%. So, we have a kid (doesn't really matter if it's a boy or girl...you decide...but I want my childrens' first names to be the last names of presidents...you know, Roosevelt Morton, Hoover Morton, Jefferson Morton, Madison Morton, Buchanan Morton, Harrison Morton [that's my personal favorite], and Reagan Morton [that's my favorite for a girl].  Alright, so i have a kid. Now technically, half of my genes' heritage goes to the kid, and half of my wife's...i never gave her a name...again, be my guest...so, the kid should be 50% English, and then half of all my %s (I don't feel like math at this hour).  Now here's the rub. My Swedish grandfather was 100% Swedish because he came from Sweden. That's where I get 25% of my Swedishness. Now, since I came from America, aren't I 100% American just like he was 100% Swedish? So does my heritage just disappear or am i a 200% man? Don't give me that some countries are older than others; America is still a country, no matter how long it's been here. I was born here, so I'm 100% American. But I'm also 100% heritage. So, really, my kid is a 150% kid.  I just don't get it.

      I'm referring to literature and pop culture, you know, how almost everything is in threes.  3 days of school 3 days on the weekend to prepare for 3 days of school 3 days of senior goodbye stuff (picnic, brunch, graduation) 3 nominees for the best/most lists (i know the results...i may accidently mention them if I find a c-note in my hand) 3 senior friends I'm really, really going to miss 3 junior choir members we have to leave a legacy to 3 fingers on my left hand  What, you never noticed?  So, this is a busy weekend for me...I guess my last busy weekend of my...oh my god...this is the last weekend of my high school career where I have to return to school...next weekend, I'll never be back in class again...i'm so depressed...will someone give me the number of a good psychologist?  I can't comprehend that this is happening to us...can you out there? It's just too surreal...I remember my first day, my first events, my first year, everything of the past, always knowing I'll be able to do something else tomorrow. Well, on June 3, there is no tomorrow. The life I've adapted to, the life I love and bask in, has to go away...far away.  But, I get to drink root beer water after graduation.  You see, I loved the rootbeer water that the cafeteria served our freshmen year. "Rocky Mountain" was the brand. They also had black cherry and lemon-lime. Then, sophomore year, they changed brands the that "crystal crap" they have now. The water you get today is sour or bitter, but the water of yesteryear was sweet and soothing, at least rootbeer and black cherry...so, anyway, thinking ahead and being the typical sentimental slob that I am, I bought a bottle of root beer water for $1.25 (is that how much it still costs?). That bottle has been in my refrigerator for 3 years...I even remember perfectly walking through the halls the day i bought it, showing it to people, and saying that I'd be saving it to graduation...we could all celebrate with the forgotten rootbeer water I said.  That was always supposed to be the event that would come at some time...in 9 days, that rootbeer water is being consumed, the official sign that our high school careers are done.  Marc's bringing cups (champaign classes for he and I, because we're special)  5/28 = worst day of the year for the Cubs. Two LOSSES on one day, all thanks to Rob Macowiak. Game 1 of double header, Barrett hits a PHGS(8) to give the Cubbies a 1 run lead...then Borowski blows his first save and serves up a WOGS(9) to Macowiak in the 9th. Game 2, Patterson hits a 2runHR(6) and we get some insurance, but Hawkins blows the save, to guess who, Macowiak on a 2run GTHR(10)...the Pirates won in the 10th, I'm not sure how  Random Factoid: NU offers a freshman seminar analyzing whether Arabic tales are pornograhic and innappropriate.

OHIO  O H I O  Any way, that's just a random thought...no reason Ohio would have any significance to my post.  So, this weekend was like most others...I ate and slept and sang...what I always do.  Listened to music, watched TV, road on 6 roller coasters, checked the Cubs scores...nothing unusual.   Oh, I forgot...I drank Mountain Dew...that was unusual...I haven't had Mountain Dew in quite a while...never really liked it...but I liked it enough to have it 3 times this weekend...so that was kinda unusual.

Another random symantics comment...I like symantics, I'm not sure why...I just like to analyze words...like symantics...what a funny word...anyway, I was thinking how I really hate it when people say "neether" or especially "eether"...occasionally, I can tolerate at "neether" as in "me neether," but it really gets on my nerves when people say "eether"...I say "eyether" and usually "neyether"...try it...it's about time the youth of america sounded a little more formal.  I like elipses too, but you already knew that.  Random Factoid: Rutherford B. Hayes's wife was nicknamed "Lemonade Lucy"  Pip Pip...

      How would I know...I didn't see much of it, or any of it...unless you call 1-4 the morning...you see, I slept till 2...that was fun.  But in all seriousness, Prom was great...you have no idea how much I enjoyed it...and I'm not a dancer...but I gladly spent my Senior Prom dancing the night away with the lovely Hayley Strege. Guess what song I'm humming to myself right now...(Christy, I know you know)  That wonderful night kinda makes me feel depressed, though. Like, why did I never get myself into a relationship...4 years and I'm one of the only people without and relationship, and boy would have I liked to have one.  But I digress.  Mother's Day was very nice. Had a little dinner at le olde Olive Garden before the big Survivor finale. Rob was the best player EVER and he lost to his fiance...but many of you probably don't watch, so I'll shut up.  Trying to think of a random comment...  Not coming to me...  Blogger changed their format.  That wasn't very random...  Or funny...  Well, maybe better luck next time  4/9 = After 13 grueling innings, the Cubs finally pull through with a 5-4 WIN off the bat of Corey Patterson. Aramis Ramirez, with 2outs in the tenth, hit a bomb of Shawn Chacon (6-6 lifetime) to tie the game.  Random Opinionoid: "Hey Ya" is definately my favorite song to dance to. I go crazy. And of course, as things typically work for me, that was the one song Hayley missed because she had to go to the ladies' room. What bitter irony. My one good dancing song, and she missed it.

      That's right, I'm done with my first week of AP testing...and I'm positive I got 3s on all of them, far off from the 5s I needed  The days are zooming away people...zooming...I've started planning my goodbyes...I hate it...  But Prom is Saturday, and I'm looking forward to that...hoping I'm not embarassing or boring...somewhere in between would be good...i'm sure I'll be boring cuz I'm serious, shy, and easily intimidated in social situations.  In other news, all choir people must read joe's blog. Just click the "Masca" link on my side panel. He wrote a very sentimental, meaningful post you must read.  You know what I'm munching on...guess...bet you won't...let's make this a game...tag it up people if you have a guess on what I'm munching on...I'll let you all know tomorrow night...just to let you know, this is the only food allowed in the computer room because it's not sloppy and the rest of the family loves to snack on it as well...another clue, very small and salty...this will be fun...if anyone reads this anymore...  5/6 = Cubs win 11-3...Clement is 5-1...good day for the Cubby Blue  Random Factoid: Grutter v. Bollinger is a Supreme Court Case involving Affirmative Action  Pip Pip

      Anyone who actually reads my blog, I apologize for not giving you anything new for over a week...as I'm sure is the case with you, I've had things left and right.  So much has happened since then, that I can't possibly tell all of it. So, I'll tell what I think of in the next 5 minutes.  Went to the Top 25...Mrs. Loh was awesome...I'm really, really glad I invited her and got her to come.  On that note, I forced Mrs. Atchison into a mid-life crisis. I mistakenly asked her about the dinner, which she was not attending. She then started crying in class about how much work she does and how much she gives us and no one thought to invite her. Today, she said she had an "epiphany" and realized her old world of english is being phased out by the fast-moving technological world...she said she doesn't want to do any of this anymore, she doesn't care, and she just wants to retire...it's terrible...she's no longer mrs. atchison.  The April (now May) edition is out. Well, it will be tomorrow...then senior edition...then I never lay out another page...it's very sad.  Choir, on the other hand, is also coming to end, and I couldn't be happier. This was supposed to be my senior year, the year that all previous seniors enjoyed so much. Their last chance at everything they love. McGlynn's a lazy bast*$@. First he ruined my favorite concert by being too lazy to do capers, so instead we do 4 stupid songs...he didn't have us compete in an actual competition...he doesn't teach Choraliers songs...he gave Andy Nicely-Nicely, an obvious faux-pas...he loves and kowtows to Andy, the fat annoying bisexual numbskull who can't sing well, on pitch, or with any decent quality...he's having Choraliers sing one stinkin number at the LAST concert, and it's a stupid jazz piece...he promised me something big for my senior concert and he "didn't get around to it."...I am so sick and bloody tired of him and his crony, I huff, puff and blow the school down.  I ran a scholastic bowl tournament for jr. highs on Saturday. It went incredibly well. I achieved my goal, because District 54 is going to start a scholastic bowl season next year.  I've taken 2 AP tests, both have been very difficult...3 more to go...I know many of you have many more than little ol' me, so best of luck  That's all I can think about. In short, yay to Sextant, Scholastic Bowl, classmates taking AP tests, Mrs. Atchison and the last Top 25 Dinner. Boo to Choir, McGlynn, Andy, and the AP tests themselves.  5/4 = Cubs scored 1R in 2 games versus the D-Backs last week. When I fell asleep tonight, it was 6-0 in favor of Arizona. The Cubs need Prior to get rid of Mitre, and they also should be able to hit a knuckleballer throwing 60mph grapefruits over the plate with the wind blowing out.

      Sue me, what can you do me? I haven't blogged in 13 days. But really, what's in 13 days besides 312 hours? (no, i didn't use mental math...there's this little thing under accessories called "Paint." Right above that is "Notepad."  You haven't read any posts from me lately for a very good reason...I haven't posted...but today, that changes...not the you not reading it part, but the me not posting part.  So why am i posting now, of all times? Well, I sup-post-ed it's because i left a post-it to post it today, it meaning my completely zany randomness at 1:50am.  By the way, what I was getting at earlier was that right above "Notepad" is "Command Prompter."  Anyway, I haven't been feeling the random vibe, so I didn't post. My life revolved around school. It fueled my randomity and interesting bits of my life (or uninteresting, whichever you prefer). Without school, I sit around doing nothing and thinking nothing.  Don't think I haven't tried to get out of the house. I've applied to a number of jobs, even interviewed for a few, with no luck. I was practically promised a job at a law firm, and was shooed away. Then the Daily Herald rejected me. I'm a disgruntled ununemployed worker (i don't think i'm official yet).  So, I spend my days watching my sister's softball games, cleaning my room, playing Strat-O-Matic, and waiting for my laptop to arrive. Really though, I'm content.  "Calculator" is above "Command Prompter"  So, I was at dinner today (btw, happy father's day to all those fathers out there reading this blog (I'm talking about you, Dan Beal) and I came up with a random rant, so I decided to post (this is where I whipped out three pads of post-its, carefully decided on using the green ones (i hate yellow and I don't want to run out of blue), and wrote to post tonight).  Anyway, why at restaurants do they insist on putting so much ice in the glasses. Listen, i understand that econonomically it makes sense since they have to spend less on softdrinks, but have they no human decency at all? It's the worst at a place w/o free refills, because you take 4 sips (5 if you're lucky) and you're done drinking...you suck on ice the rest of the meal...even with free refills, though, i request for less ice. I don't like the watered down taste or ice hitting my teeth when I sip or seeing light brown Coke at the bottom rather than thick syruppy Coke.     Thank you for your time.  I hoped you enjoyed the return of Ryan Morton  5/20 = Cubs win 5-3 over A's. Enough said.       - Also, Phil Mickelson choked on hole 17, double bogeying, and losing the chance for a grand slam. (that's right, i follow golf too...you'd be surprised how much I love sports...all sports...especially baseball...and curling...and water polo, where you try to hit the ball with stick while riding dolphins)  Random Factoid: You don't actually ride anything but the waves in water polo. In regular polo, you ride horses. Maybe we should ride seahorses in water polo. Just a suggestion (Shane, get on that)  P.S. = Shane and Christy, thank you...you know what for.

      Alright, my parents and I have narrowed down my graduation gift to two things. I thought I'd ask for all your opinions on it. So, tag it up!  Here are the choices:  In this corner, weighing in at less than 2CDs, wearing one of 5 colors, is the iPod (mini or 15GB...doesn't really matter right now).  In the other corner, weighing about the weight of a cell phone, wearing an infinate amount of colors and designs, is the cellphone (brand and minute plan unimportant as of now).  Why the iPod could be more worthwhile: It would allow me to not bring my many CDs to college; it'd all be right there...it's much smaller than a CD walkman...no matter how you turn the iPod, the song won't skip...I could take all my moms CDs with me without burning them onto another disk...all the cool kids have it (that one may not be as important)  Why the cellphone is more worthwhile: Depending on the plan, I could get unlimited minutes or long distance (stay in touch with friends in other states...wink, wink, BGSU) or things like that...I'd be more likely to call people and stay in touch with family...it's really becoming a neccessity (as much as I despise it)...always good in an emergency, or if you need to stay in touch with friends on campus but you don't know where they are.  Why the iPod is NOT worthwhile: It's really not that important...I'll be able to play music without it, just with a lot of CDs  Why the cellphone is NOT worthwhile: The iPod is a one time cost (I won't be buying from the iTunes or any of that...my CDs are fine), while the cellphone will have various charges and minutes fees...every month, i'll have to be paying for it...it's the gift that keeps on charging.  Thank you for your input.  BTW, how did I fail to mention the passing of one of the most beloved Presidents in American history? It was a sad, sad day. The random factoids will not be random this week...they will be about Ronnie.  6/7 = Cubs lost a heartbreaker to the Cardinals, 3-4. Rusch pitched alright, only gave up 2 dingers, but he hit one himself.  Not-so-Random Factoid = Reagan lived longer than any other President. John Adams lived 90 years and 247 days. In 2001, I had a daily countdown on a marker board in my room, until Reagan hit 90 years and 248 days...Oh, it was an exciting day in American history...Only 4 Presidents have ever lived to 90 (Adams, Hoover, Reagan, Ford)...Reagan died at the age of 93 (days unavailable at this time)...Ford is 91...we'll be waiting for more history in 2 years...

      Alright friends, I know it's been a while, but I'm back on track...and, with the lack of school for the next few months, I may be back to my regular posting ways...or, I'll grow so tired of it, I'll quit...either way, we outta have a really good time (reference to Robin Hood: Men in Tights (wedding/hanging)).  Now, I'm not going to be weepy or emotional or depressed like I have been in previous posts. I'm actually happy. This week was a lot of fun, so I'm not going to saddify it.  Let's start with Thursday, cuz nobody really cares what happened to me for the week prior to that...you know finished projects, watched the Cubs lose, nothing much going on.  Thursday, though, good times...Went to choir, recieved gifts and sang Friends. Sad as usual. Highlight: I didn't resign my Vice-Presidency (I found a loophole...there are no bylaws...technically, I'm still VP, and will be until I give it up...hehe...I will haunt this school)...Then, I did the announcements, my way (hehehe). I came out of the office, turned the corner, and my Stats class was standing there, applauding...that was the closest I came to crying all week. The picnic was alright...played some frisbee, some softball, that's it...come to think of it, I guess it wasn't that good, for me at least.  Friday, pretty good times as well...Did a little graduation rehearsal...went to a little thing we like to call a brunch...the food was pretty scrumpdidlyumptious...Mr. Rebeck gave a very nice speech, mentioning a ton of Chris's friends...nice personal touch...Atchison loved the Big Brother take-over of her house (I of course wimped out, thinking she'd have a breakdown)...I won most opinionated, but I already knew that....then, I went to my cousin's 8th Grade graduation...It was a class of 17, so they really got to personalize it and say nice things about each graduate...they really should have done that for SHS...I wouldn't have minded staying until midnight, would you?  Saturday was glorious...after talking about garage sales in English all year, I invited Christy, Tony, Renee, and Dave (not in my class, but that didn't matter) to go to the annual huge Timbercrest garage sale...I think they were skeptical at first, but I think they had a pretty good time...I know I did...I've never garage-saled with friends before...It was fun, looking at odd trinkets, laughing, buying cheap items...ah, garage-saling...then my sister had a softball doubleheader, but you don't want to hear about that.  Sunday, Sarah and I woke up bright and early to cantor the 7:30am mass at St. Walter Church, our first actual mass as an ensemble...I never want that mass again...we sounded like frogs...then, there was graduation at 2:00...I sang, I got my diploma, I graduated...the fun part came afterwards, when Jen, Marc, and I shared a moment with Rocky Mountain Root Beer Water...Oh, splendid RBH20...it was amazing...simply amazing...ahhhhhhhh...then I had dinner with my family at Chandlers...good stuff there, at Chandlers.  Well, enough about me...you'd think this was my blog  Going job-hunting again tomorrow...then going to school...that's right, need to go back to SHS already...God, I miss that school  6/6 = Cubs celebrated my graduation with a 4-1 win behind Greg Maddux over the Pirates  Random Factoid = 66. That's your number of the day....why don't you guess what "66" could possibly represent on Graduation Day  Random Factoid II = I have to do another one, cuz today's the 60th Anniversary of D-Day. The five beaches were Omaha, Utah (my grandpa's landing), Gold, Silver, and one other that I've forgotten.  Pip Pip!!!

      Song from an episode of Simpsons where they went to a musical on Broadway about the Betty Ford Clinic.  Speaking of which, Welcome Back (now singing theme from "Welcome Back Kotter"), You're Dreams were Your Ticket Out. Welcome Back...  enough of that. The only good thing about that show was a hot John Travolta. Oh mama.  Everyone calm down, I'm kidding...If I weren't I'd be lying here with a stoach full of pills and alcohol.  Anyway, welcome back Allie. I'm sorry Broadway wasn't what you hoped [check one of the list, next stop Hollywood...then, when that's disillusioning, you can settle down in Kansas...like Dorothy and Marianne from Gilligan's Island...nice peaceful, moral, good-hearted, well-established Kansas...I'll let you pick your city, though, so it doesn't seem like I'm telling you what to do: The big captial Topeka (the popacatepotal is not in canada, rather in mexico, mexico, mexico...sorry, randomness i couldn't resist), the really big Abilene, the center of the geographic United States (Albany, Kansas), or the really small and quaint Kansas City (KA, not MO)]  I'm just kidding (no i'm not)  GET THIS!!!!  Everybody, if you haven't seen it, go to www.dailyherald.com, look under community news for Geneva, and find the story about Astronomy Day....IT'S BY ME!!!!!AH!!!!!!   Wooo, exciting,  Anyway, I'm done talking...I'm going to miss all of you...it's almost August...you're almost leaving...except the underclassmen, in which case i'm almost leaving...I'll miss you all...some more than others (you know who you are)  Doesn't that make you wonder (except those who know)  Bascially, all of you read this blog...and there's not too many people who do read the blog, so i'd say it's a pretty safe bet that you're one of them  Except Joe...I hate him  And Christy  And Gagan  And Dan  And Shane  And Jennifer  And Tim  And Renee  And Mike  And Mambo #5  And Anonymous  Anyone else who read my blog, i'll really miss you.  Good night ev'rybody!  7/24 = 44.8% of Cubs runs come on Homers...pitiful...Sosa, Ramirez, and Lee today...that's all folks...Phillies win 4-3.

      That's right! Calvin Coolidge was born on the birthday of our country (the 96th birthday to be exact) Now, doesn't that make him the most patriotic man ever to serve our country?  I know, haven't blogged in a good while...i guess i fell into the trap...THE FIRY BLACK BOTTOMLESS PIT OF NON-BLOG POSTING...MWAHAHAHA  Yeah, that would have been really scary if like the swamp thing had said...unfortunately, I said it...however, since this isn't some crazy audio blog, you could go read that like Boris Karloff (you'd better goshdarn know who he is) and pertend you never read it any other way.  So, I've been busy this week...working man now, you know. Wake up at 7:30, get home at 5:45...ugh...at least i'm making money...on the other hand, i'm too tired to do anything with the money...or with the precious time i have left over...meh...i just layed around last summer, it's kinda good to be out and about...and yet...  Anyway, making this as random as possible.  Was just listening to my 30th Anniversary Dr. Demento Album bought in Ohio (#1, just like anyother normal 17 year old, #2, does anyone say "album" any more? not like photo album or "i'll bum along" but like a music album) and I realized how perfect the lyrics of one song's refrain are for me...picture in your mind a fast paced rhythm that's just those clavi sticks banging together...kinda the sound you can make with your tongue, except really fast...you know, the sound that's like raindrops  "on roses and whiskers on kittens"  oops, wrong song  "I'm addicted to stress, that's the way that I get things done When I'm not under pressure then I sleep to long And I hang around like a lazy bum And I think I'm going nowhere, and that makes me nervous, Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright, Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright, Everybody's out to get me but I feel alright, Everybody's looking at me."  Imagine that all run together, no pauses  Next on my mental agenda  It's kind of sad that Marlon Brando died yesterday. You know, he coulda been a contender. But when they give you an offer you can't refuse, you have to take it. I hear you can always rely on the kindness of strangers, but I bet he wound up with an earful of cider.  CHALLENGE: I just referenced 4 of Brando's best movies. Name as many as you can (the last one's easy)...please don't dissappoint...Shane, you're a movie buff...Gagan, you like old stuff like me...Kid, come on...one of you can go for the whole quartet. (btw, one of the four quotes he didn't say, but it's the most famous from the movie...he actually said "Stella")  Well, HAPPY COOLIDGE DAY!  4/3 = In 5 and half innings, the Cubs defeat the Sox, behind Maddux and HRs by Alou (his b-day), Sosa, and ... Rey Ordonez? Well, I guess he should be our starting shortstop...he won me over.  Random Factoid: Three Early Presidents died on the fourth of July. James Monroe was one. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (both instrmental to the declaration's signing) both died on its 50th anniversary...isn't that the best, most fitting historical fact ever?  Pip Pip!
