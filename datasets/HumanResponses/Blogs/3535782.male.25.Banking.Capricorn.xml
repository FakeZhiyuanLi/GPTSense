      Right now, I'm in a room with someone. A very goodlooking guy with a nice body to match his face. He's sleeping and I can't do anything about it. Oh well, that's life.

      I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you -Hoobastank

      If you wanna let your heat out, then go to one of the moviehouses at Quiapo and definitely someone will sit beside you and ask you if you want sex. Believe me, it happened to me last week and whoah! I was invited instantly to go outside the moviehouse and go somewhere private. I won't go through the details of what happened but I'm telling you it was hot!

      I just slept 4 hours. Maybe it's just the airconditioning unit, or it's just that I'm not at home. Well, you know I'm not at home right now. I'm somewhere else and I'm not used to sleeping at somebody else's house.

      This is my first post and I don't know what to put here. I'm just making a blog in the hope that google would give me a gmail account so that I can change the email I used in yahoo with that of google because of the immense storage capacity.
