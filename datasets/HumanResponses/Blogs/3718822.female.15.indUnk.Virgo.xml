      1st it was thomas now becky n  nathan, not even a post bey . . . . Anyway back to what i came to do, were cooking kinda,  How to Make - Pot Butter        Directions: 1) Using a double boiler or two pots, melt the butter on low heat. When using two pots, fill the larger (bottom) pot with water and the top pot with butter.  (Figure 9.1 shows a small bowl inside of a pot)  2) Once the butter has melted, add the weed.  The amount of weed will determine the potency.  For example, a "light" batch may use 3/4 of an ounce of weed to 5 sticks of butter.  3) Simmer for 20-30 minutes stirring every 5 minutes.  4) Let sit for 5 minutes then strain the pot butter (using cheesecloth) into a small bowl. (Figure 9.2)  5) Once cool enough to handle, pick up the cheesecloth  and squeeze out the juice.   6) Cover and refrigerate until semi-solid.    Uses: -Use in every recipe below! -Spread on toast  -Top your popcorn -As substitute for any recipe that calls for butter  Have fun:)

      it's time to be honest and stop faking it, cuz i mean seriously, if you don't i will! It's been how long now? hmmm...i dnt even kno. and yet, there's still nothing more than wat was already there. i mean come on, they way we're acting is a little overboard to keep it like this! so yea, be honest with yourself, if you don't i will...wat's it gonna be?....(okay, thats wat is on my mind! you can decide anything about it, but that's kinda wat's buggin me rite now so yea.)

      Boy, everyone is online, and yet I am still very bored and all alone! :( lol I don't kno why....but anyway. I'll jus say wat i wanted 2 say so i dnt have 2 bug yall otherwise!...well ya c rite, im thinkin bout askin my parents 2 send me 2 some far away place to live, jus so i can figure all of this stuff out. i mean, yea it sounds stupid, but i think i jus need some time to go and meet someone who never knew wat i went through (or at least knows and it still doesn't effect the way they feel about me). cuz if i meet someone, then maybe I can learn to love myself and then i would have sum1 2 talk 2 and sum1 who can b like a comfort to me. okay, now dnt yall start thinkin im weird or wat eva, i jus need sum1 2 b there fa me cuz i feel so....i dnt kno....broken maybe, or even useless. it's weird and i kno it sounds stupid, but here, everyone has sum kind of set opinion about me and they dnt give me a chance or they pretend that they want to wen they dont. it's such a cruel world, but yea since i finally let it out, i hope it works out so i can find a life! lol

      Bey, i kno yall may not care rite, but lemme give u sumtin 2 think about...it's sumthin that i discovered a lil while ago....people have weird ways of showing exactly how they feel (and they dont even kno it!). SUBCONSCIOUS ATTITUDE! It's like when you ask something or you're talking about something, and they just have such a lack of interest or constanly stray off topic. Yea, sometimes its cause they dnt wanna talk about it, but 95% of the time it's cuz they could care less about wat u do or say! It's really hurtful, especially like say, if one of yall did it 2 me...dat wuld be really really gay n stink! But then it hurts even more wen its from someone who u trusted, admired, loved, or even needed. This world gone crazy dred!!! I dont know how yall feel bout alla dat, but w.e, i had 2 do it! lol...and o yea, i kno kristin had fun las nite! ;) and i was being a bitch, but i think yall understand deep dwn wat was goin on! lol. and i found a new anthem! (extraordinary-liz phair) bey dat song is jus like i wrote it dred, everything is completely true, well almos everything! and sum1 is comin here soon but then sum1 else is leaving  :(, and jus 2 let yall kno, this may b the las time yall hear from me til skool open cuz i goin through a lot of stuff rite now n i think it wuld be better for me 2 try 2 deal with it myslef than 2 tell yall bout it n end up bringin yall dwn wit me, so i gues i'll b talkin 2 yall soon enuff and enjoy the rest of the summer. i love u guys!

      Ain no one wants to sleep with me, at least not to my knowledge. That was a threat given to the boy by my s.f. I thought it gross cuz we're like cool like how me n ur although he cud prolly beat me but I know he wudnt. The only way I'll be sleepin with ANYbody is if it involves us being unconscious for a couple of hours andnot touching.

Cuz like didn't u get permission? Anyway, sumthin else hilarious is wat Charlton(the big bruther figure)told me. he told me that doyle say me an him tryin to wybe or w/e. then he told him(charlton) that if he ever dreamed he was tryin to have sex with me he'd be a dead man. I had to him he was serious or even focused cuz i was like oook an yall kno how i is do my eyes.

       Hy peoples, my peeps(doyle more specificlyz) tlkin bout sendin all of we to sum sumer camp wybes or w/e. my thing is that theses summer "camps they gat over here, i dnt consider them as camps.my idea of watcamp shud be is with the big cafateria, cabins with bunks, limited electricity, beachs, hikin, crabbing, chapel...the whole 9yards. thas what i always knew to be camp. Camps over here are day camps(Booring) that have an extended name like Etiquette Camp, B-ball Camp, Computer Camp..whatever happened to plain ol Camp Cunningham or sumthin.   I know part of what my problem is but its like when I'm around Tasha & Doyle, I tend to stay in that type of mood feeling thing.cuz they sayi need stimulation...brain stimulation pple.(stay focused). but im thinkin well this is the only summer that i actually spent all&nbsp; of it home. Let me do a quick recap:   2000- camp (1week), states(5weeks), cat island(2) total vcay= 8weeks   2001-camp(1week) grammy(3weeks) doin nuthin(the rest of summer) total=all summer   2002-moved to nassau(shitake) states(6weeks)   2003-stayed by my fren kk (half the summer) states(other half of summer)   2004-ABSOLUTELY NUTHING   im havin like a serious convo with branden rite now...imma had to let yalls c this one

I need an opinion on whether or not i shud cut my hair and do the whole shorter hair look. or shud i perm it and treat it an let it grow?   I am kinda bored rite na. nutin much to do.   i ain really into the whole gaming wybes.  this is y pple like me need pple to b online all hours of the nite to tlk to cuz its like so borin.    an pat u need to slow down on how much drinks u chug down a nite.  ok so i guess krissys back cuz&nbsp; pat n&nbsp;mini pat seem happy:P.&nbsp;   i have to sleep on the floor cuz my bed fell dwn..the top bunk&nbsp; that is..n good ting i didnt decide to sleep inside our room.&nbsp;    yep, u kno u really bored wen changin the color for every setence that u write. friday wen i went to yg they had us split up in boys n gurls rite n we was tlkin bout sex cuz one gurl in the church (14) got pregnant she shud soon have her baby..but neway, they're talking like we dnt kno bout sex...well lemme speak fa myself, mayb  its jus cuz i'm smarter than them y i felt so funny. cuz i mean the youht leader was lyk she bin serchin fa sum info on sex that "she" knew that we didnt kno...it was like i was the only one bseide alex frum sac who knew the facts. but i excused them cuz they're kinda "special" ya c. n u kno wen we sqay special, we mean in that special waay. cuz i mean al of us thur in senior skool except one gurl an she 14..me n alex were like the only 2 who had sure plans of wat we wanted to do an they were lyk "or ya cud c she ga marry a white man" an im lyk wats rong wit that . wen it comes to pple i color blind so it dnt matter to me.and then sum of them have that   mentality that Atlanta is the all thats out there in the wurld.&nbsp; if had the muney, i'd travel for most of my summer n still spend time wit peeps an w/e. i hate to see n hear pple like that tlk cuz they jus make themself seem way more simple than i thought.&nbsp;

        Thought of the day:&nbsp; Always remember to say what first comes to mind, it&nbsp;would be a crime to hold back on saying "I love you" to someone who never knew.    yea casha, we needs 2 do sumtin fa tru...and o yea, remember wen i said i was doin sumtin fa my b-day? just pretend i never said anything, im not doing anything. Its a waste of time and money but whatever. I'll jus remember my "sweet 16" as the year i spent my birthday at school (its on a tuesday). and i still don't understand why everyone calls it "sweet 16"...there's really nothing special about it...now 17 is a good age, and so is 18, n then 21, but that's for bad reasons. ...man ey, i tryin 2 find sum1 2 give me $25! lol, i wanna go see women talk on friday night, but i dnt wanna spend anymore of my money on foolishness!     Ya kno what I realized (okay, I doubt you do and if you did...please don't tell me you did 'cause I'd be completely freaked out)...yea, I realized that - no matter what you do, there's always someone out there who says it isn't good enough;

       My uther idea for our las fun days beofre skool were:   if any of we had links we cud get like day passes to atl an chill out thur for one of the days.   or&nbsp;spend a nite at a hotel or sumthing an like that day do sumting (these jus comin off the top of my head so they may seem too ove the top but wat the heck)   or we cud....ok thas all the ideas that commin rite now..i wuda suggested a girls day spa-ing or hang out but i'm thinking of u pat..only cuz of u..c anything with the beach an water wud b ideal for the male odk cuz both he an us(me n leah..krissy n ondra&nbsp;cant cuz i ga tell&nbsp;donkey n senor swany..lol...i gues they cud come on one of the days or w.e) have eye candy.    as yall can c my mind is b constantly thinkin bout things that we cud do but i'm alwasy oopen for more suggestions...i is organize too much...i think thats called being a control freak which i am not.i can follow the leader..i do it all the time.   ok so anyway that was my 10cents on wat we shud do to celebrate ODK. ain no one tlkin to me so i ain really tlkin to no one. i''m trying not to be a nag to anyone.

Oh n u shud be like a computer program designer or technician or sumthin like that. jus as long as u ain gatta write nuthin, cuz ya handwritin wurse than Jason A.&nbsp; own on a good day in english. u need to start thinkin bout wat u wan do now cuz i think this year for career day we get to go c sum pple wit college wybe an w/e. i gata start writin for sum of them scholarships too.    &nbsp;  Attenshun ODK pple: 3things.   1) I will be making a general&nbsp;scrapbook for ODK( with&nbsp;yalls help)&nbsp;as well as one for grade 11 but that ga be dealt with wen we get thur. This means that ima need hard copies of sum pics:   &nbsp;&nbsp; A. Munchkin pic of u   &nbsp;&nbsp; B. Half ur age pic   &nbsp;&nbsp; C. Current pic   unfortunatley i wud have the least pics cuz i dnt have ne current pics of me at the moment an all my munchkin pics in abaco.&nbsp; the ones i have here by my aunty an she not ga give me them.   2) The last weekend of august which wud be the 27 &amp; 28th, we need to do lunch/movie day and then a beach day...at leas this is jus my suggestion, i jus like organize too much. but its a suggestion   3.

        Okay, if you haven't noticed, I haven't been online (Well msn) for a while. Why? Because I'm avoiding myself and what (or who..?) I used to be. I'm kinda having a 'little' bit of stress and I don't need people asking me what's wrong and just pretending to care. And Casha....don't get yourself stressed out too much, good things happen to those who wait, even if it does mean waiting forever. And you can't worry bout ya momma rite now, she's under a lot of pressure right now and she's subconscioulsy looking up to you...like you're the oldest and she knows she can count on you for help. And good news (for everyone except me)...when I graduate, daddy wants to send me to World Harvest Bible College! Now I know he really wants me to die. ok...if you think i'll be escaping high school...think again, look!   urlLink  http://worldharvestbiblecollege.org/studentlife.htm    particularly at 'dress code'...now dats crap if ya ask me! I could deal with it, but come on! (Now yall see why I so stressed out?) Anyway whatever! Have fun Kristin...even though we ga be talkin while u over there n e who...and continue 2 get drunk n b merry patrick (p.s. it's been a week) and casha we'll continue to be broken! Bye guys!

I do an don't do alot of things but i'm so bad and rude an ill-mannered and ungrateful that my teenage years must be punished   I hope yall have fun doin w/e yall doin and relax an take lots of pics pple!:D goodnite**

It's like this...I wanted it, I prayed for it, I wished for it, then i forgot about (yea right) and I hate nyslef for not 'giving in to temptation' and then i remember all of those lectures..."sooner or later someone is gonna appreciate you because of your wise decisions and your courage to just say no!" and then sometimes I don't think that's true because of how people make me seem so stupid ecause I say "no" (haha! das funny!) and then i just think....leah you're just a weird fuck! lol...n e who, das my thoughts at this very moment in time (and that moment would be 4:46 pm in the middle of a thunderstorm :D) And I think that's all I will bother you with now - ta ta!

      well i wuldnt say that n e 1 was actin like that wit me....cuz it wuld b kinda stupid of me 2 try and say exactly wat sum1 else is feeling, especially how they feel towards me, it's kind of a joint observation caused by what I get from certain guys and what they are SUPPOSED to be feeling about certain girls. Cuz i kno a dude (who shall remain nameless-so dont even ask) who is totally in2 this girl, but he says he doesnt like sayin i love u 2 girls he's really into because then it would make the girl feel kinda like he depends on her 2 live basically, which is sometimes a good thing i guess, but i always thought u didnt wanna say i love u because u dnt want sum1 2 think sumthin that isnt there....but then again that same dude will tell n e girl he's gonna screw that he loves them if it will mean he definitely has sex with them! that's kinda not good, cuz personally i wuldnt tell sum1 i love them if i didnt mean it just becasue i kno how it feels for someone 2 say i love u and dnt really mean it, yet they were saying it because either u said it or they wanted 2 get in ur clothes n they thought that was a good way to do it! i dunno man, maybe im just too over-analytical of everything but who cares? (NO1!!) (AND OH!! i got another letter from nsu, this time it talked about my specific major n it was very long and boring....but it cleared up sum things for me.)

      well today as i told sum a yalls my grammy was over here an she came to c my uncle scott who happens to b in that dump called h.m. prison(her majesty must be really b into the whole unsantized wybes) n i got to c him for the first time since he's been there. he wurks on the outside too but anywho;...no i didnt get my kiss pat cuz i ain been nowhere to get a kiss frum not even a puppy. my favorite past time has now become watching t.v. frum like 10 in the morning wit breaks in between until about 11 give or take...i kno, thas pathetic but there's not really much for me to do wen the 'rents r out jus about all day an they only stop for mummy's rest..the woman in the hopital was like "ur baby needs to pee, c her bladder is full so she needs to use the bathroom!" like in a sqeaky hi-pitched voice...um n im thinkin wat do u want her to do, punish the thing for not peeing in the womb?!?I NEED A SKIRT!!for n-wards b-day party...a new bathing suit would be nice as well:)...if anyone wants to go and watch A Cinderella Story wen it comes out..i'm almost always home so u kno where to find me.

      omg! i figured out sumtin 2day.....its'a all a game. it's like a petty thing that both parties take part in, just 2 c how far u can go until u end up not wantin 2 talk 2 eachother. like, u dnt really mean wat u say, but u say it anyway, just 2 c the reaction n u wanna make a big deal about it, but then after u do it u figure out maybe it shuldnt have been said (or done in some cases) and then it's sum form of minor regret....even if u dnt wanna admit that. and then again, it's a big game that's only played to figure out if that 'team' could work together...by kinda trying 2 get in the other's head just to see how much they can take of your 'unconstituted innocent CRAP!' (i guess u can call it crap...but that's so not nice! lol) anyway, that's my ASSesment (lol) of this whole thing....:D

      I actually wanted to abaco if that isnt new, even if jus like for a week or 2 ya kno. i really ain wanted to do nutin like that cuz i did dan say well i ga be wurkin so i ain ga have no time to do nuthin else but i gues in a way thats changed. hey, maybe i'm goin in to a deep depression. the beach or anything outside doesnt have my interest over like that. the sun is  too hot an i still dnt kno much pple. nassau is not a place that i'd want to spend my summer. its not relaxed enuff for me which is y i dnt go nowhere like that. its too..i dk freaky?..to me. cuz like i feel like i'm being monitored over here fa like ery second dred.i dnt have much space over hurr. i need to go0 back to island man. at leas thur i'd actualy go outt even though it ain much places to go but at least i'd have familiar faces. It's considered interesting if u see sum one over here more than once. jus bout ery day i meet pple that i doubt i'll ever c again but thas nassau for ya. i have a feelin i mite b goin to that youth alie thing again so i gern catch cupple more hours of shut eye since ain NO ONE i mean   NO ONE   on line that i actually talk to. oh an nick's party is a pool thing so i may get a nu bathing suit depends on how bad of a mood i'm in. an i bet my muther is so proud(yea rite) that her daughter is a moody bitchin teen:) BYE

Mummy dem say they want me do activities this summerr so i wont say that it borin but like this summer is alrteady boring cuz she dan had a mindset that i was working so i blocked out everything that i wanted to do since she say i was wurkin. an i focused on figurin out how to budget my muneys that i make cuz most likely i'll b buyin my skool supplies an things. i ga start anuther one jus to fill time an space in the blog.

      I'm so confused right about now it ain funny! Ya know like wen ya think u had sumtin figured out n then it got all messed up again? Or like sumthin happened a while bac n u somehow (Still dnt kno how) got over it and then sumthin happened 2 make it prevalent again? Man dis a buch af doo-doo! (I jus found out that Rod Stewart is the original artist of "the first cut is the deepest" [baby i kno the first cut is the deepest! wen it comes 2 b eing lucky he's first, and wen it comes 2 lovin me he's first!])okay back 2 my story. It's like I'm in a big container full of confusion, deception, lust, anger, and love! I'm so emotional!  HOW PATHETIC!  But then again if I wasn't so emotional then I wouldn't be able to help people out with their stress, cause with being emotional I become analytical, and being analytical means I can look at anything and determine all of these things it could mean or what it actually meant! It's cool sometimes but then it's so weird sometimes cause I analyze so deep that I decide not to say things that need to be said, or do things that need to be done (even though it can result in some type of pain or something!) It's like I'm afraid of myself sometimes cause I realize how powerful all of this and when I try to explain it this is what happens!  I DON'T STOP TALKIN CAUSE I CAN'T GET IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!  Anyway, I'm gonna stop talking now, and I told yall not to leave me home alone! lol, this is what happens to me when I'm alone and bored. Why yall think I've become so talkative? I don't have anyone to talk to one on one about all kinda stuff....stuff from anxiety 2 freshness! lol (YOU WANNA KNOW MORE ABOUT ME? IM THE GIRL WHO SWEPT YOU OFF YOUR FEET....HEY! HEY! GET TANGLED UP IN ME!) okay, I stop! fa now at least!

      Okay, well when you're home alone (with the exception of the housekeeper-lol) you find lots of things to do...like play with the scanner, make business cards for a fake business (dat was fun!), print out black n white pictures from disney.com n color em, n not 2 mention, search the web. But when ya really bored this is wat u do....make a schedule! lol...Okay, this is vacation wybes! lol okay, lets see, we're gonna pretend that casha and kristin arent going away (since we ain positive bout that yet) and determine how many hours of talking we have 2 do in order 2 still have all of our summer hours of internet time with eachother for when we go away, but we ga start from wen the first person goes away (patrick) until everyone gets back (and for now patrick is the last to come back-so we using his trip dates)! On average we spend about 4-41/2 hours online at nite (yea rite) so we ga call it 4 hours) Okay, patrick is going away on the 9th of july (we ga pretend he only gets 2 hours of net time)and say he comes back on 1st of sept. so that means he's away for 7 weeks and 5 days (54 days) and that gives him a total of 108 hours of net time (it should be 216 hours) and then wen i go away im away from july 28th til augusy 16th (20 days) and i have about 1 hour of net time over there, so that gives me 20 hours duh! (and it should be 80 hours) then lets say kristin and casha dnt go n e where and they have all of their hours (we start from the 9th of july til the 1st of sept, so they each have 216 net hours. so, out of the 216 hours, i have 34 days wen i have 4 hours each, so that is  136 of my 216 hours, which means before patrick leaves i need 2 get in 80 more hours! geez das a lot! lol and then patrick has 108 of his 216 hours, so he needs to get in 108 more! lord knows he gata a lot of work 2 do! lol! so in order to cut down on the hours, i have devised a plan! lol.....by calculating according to patricks 108 hours.  OUR PLAN!   according to patricks 108 hours that are needed, if we are online for the 4 hours, since it's almost time for him 2 go away, these hours will be doubled! that means patrick gets 7 extra days so 2 speak, so he gets 28 hours, leavin him with 80 more hours 2 get, so now he has the same amount as me, therefore, i wont double up on my hours on the net! lol...so if he needs 80 more and i need 80 more, we do this, every tex message will give us 1 hour, so we wuld need 2 send 80 text messages, or every time we go out wul be 20 hours, or everytime we go over our 4 hour time on the net wuld be 50 hours for every hour we go over! so we need 2 go go over 4 hours on the net one nite (50 hours), go out once (20 hours) and send 10 text messages (10 hours)! so 50+20+10=80 hours!! so if we follow the plan we will be set! OMG! I CANT BELIEVE I SAT HERE AND DID THAT! LOL...sorry guys! lol

       Today dnt feel like how friday the 13th always felt to me. 2004 Olympics officially opened today.i watched up until they showed the baha but they only show one lil clip cuz we came out wen they was on commercial.   ok pat since u left the convo early, i was saying that the last time we went out to dinner, the next day he was like who all i went wit n w/e rite n then we was like i jus wanted to c if u was ga lie(like i have something to lie about..wheres the trust). so then i think he said sumthin bout if there were any parents there with us or sumthin like that (ew, y do we want to eat with our frends  with  our parents, gross) n im like no. so then he's like well teens tend to act different/wild wen there is no parental guidance or w/e. n im thinking, not everybody does that ya kno cuz i mean of course we're gonna act different, the setting is more relaxed...its not like any of my frends are heathens or a bunch of horny kids who jus usin the group outin as a way to get loose. not everybody enjoys being followed by parents everytime they go out especially if u have to c them all summer long.   sry i gata canncel but school stuff is a reasonably good excuse this time. if any of yall get a wybe who b makin excuses all the time everytime, im srry but u shud dump em cuz theyd prolly make n excuse as to y they're late for the wedding. y is say this is cuz u can dump the wybe n not the parents. ever get tired of hearin excuses? thas how i felt which is y i gave up on askin to go anywhere but wurk or church this summer. it dnt make no sense askin wen u kno eventually the answer ga still be 'NO'. i think thas how my cuzin philipa felt wit her dad, which is y she start hangin wit evra n havin bf's on da low n things.   i guess no one knows exactly wen leah comin back. ain even no one to tlk to dred. that is soo freaking gay dred. ain no one here i'd tlk to...piasha cant tlk, them boys only tlk bout cartoons n boy stuff, tasha n doyle tlk bout everything is somehow linked to a cult, spottin how many black pple on t.v. n the negative attributes of my generation. oh n once in a while how most black pple who in hollywood who tryin to make sum muney sellin out or w/e.....boring crap that i try to block as much as possible. on my 18th birthday if we still in nassau n alive, yall ga be helpin move into my new apartment. or wherever we be. oh n odk must go to europe for 2 weeks that summer.   So all in all, my life is filled with boredom, boredom n more kids. at leas it wasnt cinderella's reall folks who was doin the whole mean wybes type of wybe.   later dudes

Let me be me.   Let me b free,   im tired or your lies n deciet   cuz its causing me misery.   i dnt wan to keep lookin back   cuz i kno u gat pple watchin me   an then u stalkin me,   n u watchin me,   but the minute i speak u wudnt even   tlk to me.      Let me be me.   or am i not trustwurthy?   i aint the one who's coverd in shame,   its u who durty.   am i not good enough to get sum respect?   no, hackin n readin journals   n shyt like that.   man, that is whack   but imma let it go on jus like that.   cuz y,    i aint gonna defy   the walls of rules u choose    to keep me locked in.   an u'd wonder wats wrong wit me    if i sit on the floor n star rockin.      Let me be me   let me express myself,   but nooo in this house   i have to supress myself   an become   sumone else,in this lonely house   but i really want out,   but i cant get out   cuz they wont   let me out.   cud sumbody plz let me out?

Let me be me   i cant even write free   cuz for every journal i got   sumthing bad has happened to me   but very few pple can see   wat yall doin to me   u cant make me hate my papi   thas my one n only dad-dy.   an the few pple that say    imma go freakin crazy   if i do ths ever so constantly.   but u cant c    that this shit u doin to me   is really hurtin me    n not helping me   so i ask for one thing,   to let me be me.
