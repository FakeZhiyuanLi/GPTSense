      So... after almost two years complaining about the tone of the bridge humbucker of my Ibanez RG548 ("V8"), I finally replaced it. Initially I was going for a DiMarzio PAF Pro, like in my Strat which I love. But I thought I'd rather go for something a bit more different. So I got two pickups off eBay, both DiMarzios: a DP100 SuperDistortion and a DP159 Evolution (Steve Vai's model). The SuperDistortion was hot, really good tone, good rocking pickup. But I found it slightly too trebly. Then I tried the Evolution, and thats' the one I'm keeping. It's not as powerful as I expected, but it sounds very good and it has a very good definition on the lower strings. I was also toying with the idea of coil-splitting the V7 neck humbucker, but I wanted a 500Kohm push-push pot, and I have been unable to find one... so I'm waiting on that one.  Next now is the old Arirang Strat copy... I have a new set of pickups (Kent Armstrong, HST1 for bridge, SV4N for neck and STV1R for middle), with a 5-way switch I managed to find (shorter than standard switches, hard to find) to replace the original 3-way one, and I also have a new set of pots/caps. I might also put on a switch for "neck on" so that I can get all three pickups at once or bridge & neck...  Then there's the bass. A Squier precision with an extra jazz pickup by the bridge. It's originally wired with two individual volume controls, and a master tone. I want to wire it for one master tone and one master volume, and install a blend pot to mix both pickups...   And then the telecaster... the wiring needs attention, so I'll re-do it, but I'd like to get a 4-way switch to add in the extra position both pickups in series, as opposed to the standard parallel, as I like the fatter sound it produces.  The problem is I got two new DVDs: Steve Vai "Live at the Astoria" and Joe Satriani "Live in San Francisco", so with this and the G3, it's hard to do anything else!

      I didn't meant to. But I walked past the record store and the voices said "go inside, gooo iiinsiiide"... and I don't know what happened, only that a while later I was at home enjoying the playing of Satriani, Vai, and to a slightly lesser extent Malmsteen. There's this part where Vai and his bandmates start fretting eachother's guitars... highly entertaining, great show, great music! In fact, I think I'm off to watch it again...  I also received today the 7-guitar stand I ordered on Friday from Thomann.de. I'm hoping this will keep me from acquiring too many guitars: if there's no space in the stand, I must sell something in order to get another guitar.  The problem is... I already own 8 guitars.

      Nothing much, just something to open the blog. It's way too late and I should be sleeping. Tomorrow is a holiday but didn't realise so I planned some experiments at work, and now I have to go. Early. I don't like mornings.   And I have guitar bits all over the place, even on my bed. Yep, this is what I'll initially post about... my modifications to some perfectly fine guitars that I cannot just leave alone. hey! it's cheaper than buying more guitars and keeps me busy! What's that saying about idle hands? Besides, if I didn't do this I might actually do something productive! Like... well, like practicing and learning to play the damn thing, for starters! Oh no, then I'd be sure to discover how utterly talentless I am, and I am not sure I can do that. Not right now.  Anyway, today I just changed the bridge pickup on my  urlLink Ibanez RG548 ... but more about that later. Now I just gotta see if this works, and clear my bed.
