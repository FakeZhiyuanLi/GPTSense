       John Kerry platforms:    On health insurance-  Kerry would allow every American access to health care through the Federal Employees Health Care Benefits program (FEHBP), which offers a wide range of plans with good benefits, insuring the most vulnerable groups—the unemployed and retirees under 65. He would ensure affordable coverage with tax-based incentives to employers and tax credits to individuals and the self-employed. To hold down premiums, the federal government under Kerry will reimburse companies for 75 percent of catastrophic claims totaling more than $50,000, provided they pass the savings on to their policyholders. He also seeks to encourage small businesses to provide coverage for employees by offering refundable tax credits up to 50 percent of coverage to small businesses and their employees to help subsidize the cost of health insurance. Kerry’s plan would cost $895 billion over 10 years.    On Medicare-  Kerry does not call for major cuts that cause premium increases and cutbacks in benefits. He plans to fight for quality care in all parts of the country – rural and urban—and make sure that seniors get quality care no matter where they live. He would will implement a real prescription drug benefit in Medicare and he will never force seniors into HMOs. His four step plan includes: lowering prescription drug costs, giving choices to seniors rather than giveaways to HMO’s, expanding prescription coverage and not taking it away from those who have it, making sure there is always a Medicare-run plan for every senior.   On prescription drugs-  Kerry supports adding a strong affordable prescription drug benefit to Medicare that does not rely on HMOs or undermine retiree coverage that exists today. He would reduce drug costs for everyone by: using the federal government's purchasing power to induce giant drug wholesalers to pass along to consumers the rebates they get from the drug manufacturers; getting more affordable generic drugs to the market, giving states the flexibility to negotiate better deals; and allowing people to buy quality drugs through Canada.    On medical research-  Kerry pledged to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies that sponsor medical research. He has a three-pronged strategy to make sure advances in science and medical research benefit American families: (1) Assure we are not undermining the power of science and technology to find new treatments and prevention for our most devastating diseases; (2) Improve our health care system to assure our providers and patients use and get the most effective care; (3) Make sure protections are in place so there are no barriers that prevent patients from receiving care.   On embryonic stem cell research-  Kerry will increase stem cell research, ending Bush's “block” on federally funded stem cell research.   George W. Bush platforms:    On health insurance-  Bush wants to enact tax credits to enable the uninsured to buy the health care coverage they need, and to expand community health centers to provide quality care for low-income Americans, rather than in emergency rooms. He believes small businesses should be able to pool their risks to provide employees with affordable healthcare.    On Medicare-  On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed the Medicare Act of 2003 to reform and modernize Medicare. His plan increases prescription drug coverage and offers special help to one-third of seniors with low incomes. He says that forcing private health plans to compete for seniors’ business by providing better coverage at affordable prices will help to control the costs of Medicare by using market-place competition, not government price-setting. Bush believes that private sector competition will result in more innovation and flexibility in coverage because involving politicians and bureaucrats threatens peoples’ access to state of the art care.    On Medicaid-  Bush proposes providing increased health coverage to low-income Americans, to Medicaid and uninsured children through Children's Health Insurance Programs.   On prescription drug coverage-  Bush says he is proud to offer seniors and disabled Americans prescription drug coverage through Medicare for the first time. Beginning in 2006, seniors without coverage will be able to join a Medicare-approved plan that will cut their yearly drug costs roughly in half, in exchange for a $35 monthly premium. All seniors will save from steps to bring safe, lower cost generic drugs to market sooner, an effort strengthened by the new legislation that is estimated to save American consumers about $35 billion over the next 10 years.   On medical research-  Bush plans to increase funding for the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) efforts to support research to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of diseases. The budget includes $5.9 billion for bioterrorism preparedness, an increase of $4.5 billion – more than three times the 2002 base funding level.    On embryonic stem cell research-  Citing ethical concerns, Bush has limited federal funding. He would allow research to continue but restrict scientists to using only existing lines of cells.

       The uninsured - According to a recently released report by University of Michigan School of Medicine, approximately 43 million Americans are currently uninsured. Three years of in-depth study found that 18,000 deaths a year can be attributed to a lack of health insurance; 80 percent of Americans who are uninsured have jobs or are part of families in which someone works; uninsured Americans get about half of the care that those with insurance receive, and they forego preventive care, such as blood pressure and cancer screenings, and annual check-ups for their children, as well as routine care of chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.  UofM advanced five recomendations to judge future health plans that aim to reduce the number of uninsured:  "Health care coverage should be universal, continuous, and affordable to individuals and families. The strategy for health insurance should be affordable and sustainable for society. Health insurance should enhance health and well-being by promoting access to high-quality care that is effective, efficient, safe, timely, patient-centered and equitable."   This call for action has prompted our favorite presidential candidates to address this plaguing issue, in response to public opinion polls showing that up to 80 percent of Americans are ready for fundamental health care reform that achieves universal coverage. Some proposals include tax credits, cutting cost of care, and increased enrollment in already established programs. But, we'll get more into the candidates on Part II.   Embryonic stem cell research - Embryonic stem cells are primitive cells removed from a five-day-old embryo called a blastocyst. The cells are then carefully grown in a culture dish, and with the right conditions they then retain the ability to make copies of themselves indefinitely. Treating the cells with specific growth factors allows scientists to morph the ES cells into any of the 200 cell types of the human body (yes, it's pretty spectacular). Scientists hope to someday treat a wide variety of degenerative diseases— like Parkinson’s disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, heart attacks, and even spinal cord injuries — with new stem-cell derived therapies.   But this is not without controversy. Critics (the religious right) believe the research is immoral because the extraction process kills embryos. However, if these people knew what they were talking about, they would realize in actuality ES cells don’t come from a fetus because by the time a human embryo has developed into a fetus, its ES cells have already been designated as a specific cell type. The potential benefits, in my opinion, clearly outweigh the issue of morality because stem cells may save lives by repairing and replacing damaged and diseased tissue, including nervous tissue. Scientists believe that ES cell research could provide answers about how specialized embryonic cells develop in embryos and how they function to form the organs and tissues of the human body. The American Medical Association, New England Journal of Medicine, and American Medical Colleges have expressed support for embryonic stem cell research.    Medicare reform - OK, how do I summarize this in a nuthsell. Well here's a start: the newly-signed legislation reforming Medicare and instituting a new prescription drug plan will affect a whole heck-of-alot. Physicians argue that they are not being paid enough (what else is new?). [Well, they're really saying that the payouts by the government won't cover their rising overhead costs...you know, the costs to run their practice...and, well, i can sympathize with them.] Health care reform experts say that the increase in payments is not nearly enough to compensate for the cut in drug price. And senior citizens simply do not want to pay for rising drug costs out of their pocket. So it's all one big bungled mess. We basically need to balance out the costs of actually treating patients versus the amount of money our country is willing to spend on it.   If you feel that our citizens deserve universal health care, then you better be alright with increases in your income tax. If you want less taxes, then you better be comfortable with the idea that people in your own community will not be able to receive adequate health care because the government does not want to pay for it. The best ideas lie somewhere in the middle of what I have just mentioned. But we'll get into all that in a future article, where I will look at Universal Health Care and its issues.   Prescription drug coverage - The recently-signed Medicare Act of 2003 marks the first time in our nation’s history that Medicare will cover prescription drug costs for seniors. The law gives older Americans better choices and more control over their health care and provides more access to comprehensive exams, disease screenings, and other preventative care. In about two years, full prescription coverage will begin. The plan provides seniors with a drug discount card for the two-year transition period, a time which concerns many critics of the law and seniors. Although this law is a major step forward and represents progress towards a healthier future for our nation’s elderly, critics claim that this “compromise bill” is not enough, prompting Democratic presidential candidates to propose further changes to reform Medicare to create better healthcare for more Americans. Democrats note that the gap between the average price paid by the government and the average price paid in Canada compared with cash consumers in America is shocking, due to patients’ inabilities to buy in bulk. Isn't it sad that in order to balance the costs of prescription drugs we have to begin importing drugs at a lower price from Canada. The US Pharmaceutical industry, well, they're full of assholes. And you better beleive that I'll get into that whole other monster in a future article.   Medicaid cuts - Medicaid funding is a major issue on the state and federal level and will continue to be a source of contention between those who want to provide coverage and those who place priority on other spending. Low reimbursement from Medicaid patients could force some physicians to drop Medicaid patients as doctors struggle with whether to continue serving the Medicaid population to the financial detriment of their practices. Physician groups worry that the populations most affected by the cuts — as states drop their non-mandated Medicaid patients — are the most vulnerable: the physically and mentally disabled who have difficulty getting private coverage. The cuts also hurt children as some states reduce eligibility for working parents. New cuts mean not only a shrinking pool of specialists for referrals, but also reduced drug benefits for patients, causing doctors who remain in the program to face even more pressure from the continually expanding mandatory Medicaid population.

      I caught the trailer to Michael Moore's new movie  Farenheit 9/11  today. I must admit, it looks rather intriguing. The whacko right have already come out of the woodwork to discredit much of what is presented on there, but it's ironic because 99% of them have yet to see it. And many of us may not get to see it either, if Disney has its corporate way. They are refusing to release it in the US and will only allow it in theatres abroad. How outrageous! Looks like they love the free reign of pooping all over the the First Amendment. The Weinstein's have already purchased the movie for $6 million in their attempt to distribute it. If this movie is anything like  urlLink  Bowling for Columbine  , then we're probably in for a treat. While Moore tackled the topic of Gun Control in  Bowling  and the effects of Corporate Downsizing in  urlLink  Roger and Me  , in this film Moore examines what happened to the United States after September 11; and how the Bush Administration used the tragic event to push its own agenda. This documentary was prepared by Moore, a controversial filmmaker who likes to skewer the rich and powerful.    urlLink     Well, in this film,  Fahrenheit 9/11 , Moore links the Bush family with prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden. It describes financial ties that go back three decades and explores the role of the government in evacuating relatives of Mr. bin Laden from the United States shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The film was financed by Miramax and was expected to be released this summer. But Moore's agent said that Michael Eisner, Disney's chief executive, had expressed concern that the film might jeopardize tax breaks granted to Disney for its theme park, hotels and other ventures in Florida, where Jeb Bush is governor. If that is the reason for Disney's move, it underscores the dangers of allowing huge conglomerates to gobble up diverse media companies. Bias in the media, anybody???  On the other hand, a senior Disney executive says the real reason is that Disney caters to families of all political stripes and that many of them might be alienated by the film. Those families, of course, would not have to watch the documentary.  It is hard to say which rationale for blocking distribution is more depressing. But it is clear that Disney loves its bottom line more than the freedom of political discourse.   urlLink Trailer: Farenheit 9/11

       urlLink    Well, looks as though Lord Stanley's Cup has found its home for the next year. Yup, right here in the US's very own toilet, Tampa Bay. OK, that was harsh. But Calgary got screwed! I am one of them who can agree with Flames' coach Darryl Sutter, saying that there are factions in the NHL who are VERY pro-Lightning. How else would you explain Nieminen's suspension in Game 5 or the "would-be" Stanley Cup-winning goal by Gelinas in Game 6, where no call came from "upstairs" claiming that the puck did actually cross the goal line. Looks like the "powers that be" in the NHL wouldn't like a small-market team winning their Cup; that it may be bad for ratings. If anything, I find it sad that the Cup made its way to the US, in particular to Florida. Florida has about as much history with hockey as I do with being President. Send the Cup to Calgary. Go figure. Anyways, let's hope Lightning owner Bill Davidson will not double-up on his joy this month. Let's hope Lakers spank the beejeezus out of his other team...the Pistons!   urlLink Article: Lightning Lift the Cup

        urlLink     &nbsp;    "I … have been described as an undying optimist, always seeing a glass half full when some see it as half empty. And, yes, it is true – I always see the sunny side of life. And that’s not just because I’ve been blessed by achieving so many of my dreams. My optimism comes not just from my strong faith in God, but from my strong and enduring faith in man." --  Remarks at the dedication of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, November 4, 1991    Having not seen any of his movies, I'm really in no position to comment on his acting ability. However, as an actor he was not the most stellar, or he would have recieved many more major roles. As a person, his opponents try to paint him as an insensitive, racist homophobe. While he was not supportive of homosexuals or minorities, I don't think he stood openly against them either. He did, however, have many racist supporters. Reagan can best be summed up as an eternal optimist by his supporters. He firmly believed that what he was doing was right and could not see the bad in either it or those around him. This is good in the sense that he radiated confidence, bad in the sense that it was often a crippling weakness.   As a President, I say: "What a mess!" Supply-side economics, while panning out for some people in the long term, was by most accounts a failure. Basically, by giving tax cuts to the rich and the upper-middle class, they were able to spend that money on cocaine (remember how cocaine in our ghetto streets soared?) and lobbyists for more tax breaks. A ton of social programs were cut as well (some of them justifiably so, many of them not) and the defense budget was pumped up to an ABSURD level (Star Wars SDI, anyone?). In essence, Regan's economic policy took money from the poor and gave it to the rich and the military. Reagan did NOT bring down the Soviet Union. Given its loss of power and Gorbachev's reformist nature, it was already on the brink of collapse. All Reagan did was push them to the brink of war.  And Iran-Contra...Need I say more? Granted, there is no hard evidence that this was directly Reagan's doing, but many of those around him were either indicted or forced to resign. Reagan himself SIGNED a presidential finding authorizing the sale of weapons to Iran in exchange for the Iranians leaning on the militants in Lebanon to release hostages. Not only was this illegal, but it didn't work: the US had to give the Iranians 4 times what they originally asked for to secure the release. The money from this sale was then funnelled into Nicaragua to aide the Contras (depicted by the Reagan administration as being freedom fighters when in fact they were far more brutal than the administration they were trying to overthrow). This was done in clear violation of a Congressional Amendment. Go figure...  And I must comment on Reagan and AIDS. From everything that we can ascertain from the historical record [or at least from what I have read], Reagan's religious background, feelings or beliefs had nothing to do with the political response to the AIDS epidemic. Rather, his appalling lack of leadership and vision — which led directly to enormous setbacks for HIV/AIDS research, discrimination against people with AIDS and the lack of any comprehensive outreach for prevention or education work, thus adding to the already-staggering tally of deaths — was a product of indifference, disdain, self-imposed ignorance and a political capitulation to the rising wave of a new, staunchly reactionary and religious Republican constituency that was to reshape not only the party but the state of American politics. Although AIDS was first reported in the medical and popular press in 1981, it was only in the end of 1987 that President Reagan publicly spoke about the epidemic. Already nearly 60,000 AIDS cases had been reported of which half had died. How could this happen? Didn't he see that this was an ever-expanding epidemic? How could he not say anything or do anything? I mean he was the leader of the free world. C'mon! But the public scandal over the Reagan administration's reaction to AIDS is complex and goes much deeper, far beyond the commander-in-chief's refusal to speak out about the epidemic. Reagan understood that a great deal of his power resided in a broad base of born-again Christian Republican conservatives who embraced a deeply reactionary social agenda of which a virulent, demonizing homophobia was a central tenet. Whacko conservatives (Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell) articulated these sentiments that portrayed gay people as diseased sinners and promoted the idea that AIDS was a punishment from God and that the gay rights movement had to be stopped. That's what has tainted Ronny's Presidency the most, imho.  While you may think I disliked Rocin' Ronny, he still is an extraordinary man. Because he did, indeed, restore the confidence of the American people, and raise our spirits during the Cold War, was a very good public speaker (unlike our current president), and supported the unemployed in Flint, MI (even Michael Moore couldn't badmouth him there).   So what's the verdict? Reagan isn't the worst president we've had nor is he the worst president of the 20th century (Nixon, Harding, Hoover and LBJ just on foreign policy alone all have him beat). However, the people who think he's this gleaming beacon of patriotism and the ideal, true American and the greatest leader of all time really need to stop blindly idolizing the guy for just one minute and take a look at what he actually DID. While I respect him as an impressive leader of the free world, a saint he was not. With that said, rest in peace President Reagan.   urlLink Article: Reagan dies at 93

      OK...just testing out this thing. I have some ideas for where I eventually want this site to go. As I am neither new to blogging nor a blogging expert, my last attempt fizzled into obscurity as a result of neglect. Let that be a lesson to all of you. You must nurture your creation for it to thrive. They say, "Build it and they will come..." Well, I will build it, but we'll see if anyone'll come.
