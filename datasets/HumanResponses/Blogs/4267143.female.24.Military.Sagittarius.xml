      My colleague said that I looked black this morning when he saw me. But the most important thing is that he said I look cute. Haha.. Thanks..  So busy at work today, almost had no time to go to the ladies..Tomorrow will be worse. Got to clear all my backlog after not being around in the office for 3.5days. Went to town to get the farewell card for my ex-boss. Didn't find anything big and to my fancy but then still managed to forcibly settle for one. Just hope they won't complain to much when they see it. To get a phone without line at less than $400 with camera, MMS, Java &amp; whatever shit ?!! Crazy. Of course, it's possible. Only found that 4 models that fit the bill but don't think the committee will agree. Thought could get SX1 at that real good deal but too bad, no more stock. Aiya, ask the chairman go chi da bian lah..  Waiting, waiting... Forget it, I'm off to iron my uniform and then to bed..

      Got up early, at 8am... My hun's grumbling & complaining.Used to it already.Hehe.Felt good to continue working on my room, hope that it can be ready in 3 weeks' time. Mum cooked my favourite; porridge.. It's nice but my hun's better. :P  Miss her porridge.. When can I have it again, hun ?  Delivered Mac to her at the range. Had plans to leave after the delivery, but got stuck there again. My hun is feeling upset, or rather jealous after reading my profile last night.. Hehe. Beat one BIG round bush before telling me what is wrong. I have a hun who loves archery, work n also vinegar. Lots of vinegar!! Haha. Luckily not possessive, if not, I wouldn't have any breathing space.. But then, it's cos she loves me. Stayed under the sun for 3 hours, reading my Pioneer. Became a roast monkey. My hun's even worse. Her face got sunburnt. So kelian.. Better apply moisturizer, hun.. If not, wait I don't want u.. Hehehe :P

      Woke up feeling sucky.... Shucks... Going back to work on yet ANOTHER Sat.. I have been coming back for duno how many Sats.. People get to go for alternate Sats n I only claim that off during weekdays.. Why can't I enjoy the feeling of waking up late again on alternate Sats, just like my other colleagues ??? Don't want to put me up for awards, no more ranking No1 this year, still expect me to come back almost everyday... What crap is this ? So sick & tired... Work sucks!!!  My bout of terrible flu came after sitting in the stupid office. Becoming reindeer soon. Finally I updated my profile. Changed quite a few things here and there. I think the most important thing is my 'Status'.. Updated my hun's as well, only the photo part though.  Bought quite a number of things from carrefour. Brought my voucher along but didn't get a chance to use as I had left it in the car. Absent minded.. Never mind, some other day then..My flu's getting better after the medicine.. Thanks, hun..

      went back home in the noon feeling down.. what has got into me recently ? am i thinking too much ? maybe, maybe not... started to pack all that I had moved back home yesterday...was halfway through & I knew that if I went back to sleep, I would wake up, feeling better and not be angry with my hun anymore...I was right.. felt so much better after the short nap...  though my hun said that she will accompany me today n not go for shooting, but I still persuaded her to go for training when I picked her up.. Contradicting ain't I ? Early part of the day, I was still complaining that she had no time for me but after that, I asked her to go for training...Anyway, good to know that her shooting today is getting better.. Think she should be ready for competition at the end of the month...  Finally reached home.. as usual, called her mobile to tell her I'm safe & sound.. And as usual n expected, she's asleep after the long day at work, with me and shooting...  good nite, hun...

      Woke up feeling zombie yesterday... had butterflies in the stomach.. practical test later on... didn't think that i could make it at the end of the day.. can't even handle the crank course.. fail fail lor.. don't care liao.. no motivation, no additional money also..better fail me rather than tell me re-test... work so hard, also no use..  called irene up yesterday.. she's back!!finally!!!good to hear her voice.. think she must have put on quite a few kgs after being in the states for so long.. she was working out in the gym..  went to dawn's place around 5pm.. the route so familiar..used to travel by that same old route everyday.. nothing has changed in the house.. her room ? no longer ours.. it belongs to somebody else and hers now...smoked by the same place.. brings back lots of memories.. was so heavy hearted when she helped me move my things to the car.. even more so when i returned her house keys to her...good to know that she's getting on very fine now..  just quarrelled with my hun.. don't know what is wrong with me.. just cos she wasn't free to talk to me ? but then i just wanted to ask what time she's free for lunch so that i know how to plan my noon off.. it's not the 1st time she's like that.. what's more, thought i should be understanding enough towards her job.. why did i flare up ? i shouted at her.. as i ate my wanton mee, i thought to myself, negative ones.. my hun has got no time for me.. work, archery, home.. where am i? why am i always the one to make time for her ? why can't she make time for me ? fine.. she can do whatever she wans.. im nobody anyway... there will come a day where i know how much i mean to her...

      I'm still trying to learn how to use this bloggy thingy.. Can't figure out very much, though.. Maybe should get my honey to come help me.. Don't even know how to post pics.. Hai~~~no hope liao..  Finally!!!! found time to wash bluey yesterday.. Was hard work.. Took me a whole 2 hours.. Was so tired, sticky and smelly after that.. But well worth it, for my bluey is now clean, but then again, only for 5 hours.. She came over to my place after work yesterday; to watch the archery competition on Olympics.. Not too bad a game.. Was sitting with her on the sofa, till I went over to the comp to do my stuff.. Could see that her face was black black.. Hehehe.. But since u didn't say anything, then ok, I shall continue sitting there.. By the time, i fetched her home, it was already 12midnight.. The worse thing, it was pouring at her area.. There goes my 2hours of cleaning job!!!! Reached home &amp; called her mobile.. As usual, she had already fallen asleep.. Expected it anyway.. :p
