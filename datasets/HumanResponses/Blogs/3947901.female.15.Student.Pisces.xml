      Last night I stayed in the worst hotel I've ever been to in my entire life!The place was just disgusting. The air conditioner was a piece of shit, there was no pool, and the bathroom was the size of a small closet (if that!) It was just gross. I can not wait until we move into our new house. New surroundings, new people, new house, new everything! I can't wait. Change is definetly a good thing!!! But I will miss all my friends but I've only got like 2 close friends and the rest are really just acquaintences. (Did I spell that right?) Besides, new school=new guys. Yay!!! I'm trying to get over Joe and hopefully this will help.&nbsp; From what I've heard though, UT is a homosexual and lesbian school. God I hope not! I don't have anything against gays and lesbians because I have a lot of gay friends. It's just that I want a boyfriend too! I'm sure there will be tons of hot guys though. Let's cross our fingers and hold our breath!

      Last night I got this really pretty sparkly playboy bunny ring! I got it from Spencers. I fell in love with it the minute&nbsp;I saw it! It's pretty. The bunny is filled in with white crystals and then the eye is a blue crystal. I love it. And thanks to my friend, KT, I also got a black playboy bunny armband from Hot Topic. They gave her a 5 finger discount. ;) I'm like totally obsessed with the playboy bunny now. I want to get a pink poster that has the playboy bunny on it and it says Playmate. But I am not a slut! Nor am I a future playmate. Though it would be nice. I'd love to live with Hugh Heffner. He's kind of cute for an old man.

        I'm never babysitting for these kids ever again! I've been watching cartoons all day and I'm about ready to scream! I've had to break up I don't know how many fights. I've been coloring for hours at a time and I'm to the point where I'm about to snap. Someone help me. Put me in a mall with friends and I'll be fine. Hurry...If you want me to live you'll put in the mall...Ahh....No just kidding. I'm not really dead but of course, you already knew that huh? But anyways, back to the point. I'm not babysitting for them ever again. Next summer I'm getting a job in the mall. I mean come on think about it! Air conditioning, getting to scope out guys all day, employee discount! It's making me wet just thinking about it. LOL.

       Hey what is up my homie g dawgs from the south central side? Not too much here. I watched the rest of EuroTrip earlier. It's funny as hell!!!!!!! There's this part where this little boy draws on a Hitler mustache and then marches around the frontroom like Hitler. I started laughing my ass off! And last night I watched Freddy Vs. Jason. That movie is scary as hell. But it was really super good. Tonight I'm probably going to rent Honey or something else. I can't remember what all I wanted to rent. There were like a bunch but I didn't have enough cash on me. I need to save my money!!! Ugh poopey fish sticks. I have a hard time saving money. It's not something I'm good at. Anyways, I'll talk to you laters k? Love ya! *mwah*

        This is my first entry on this site. I've got another journal on Xanga if anyone wants to check it out. My username is HopefulWishes88. Check it out sometime!   I'm really bored and I sort of feel lonely. Love is a crazy and complicating thing. People say its a totally kick ass awesome feeling but to be honest, I'm beginning to question that. No one is ever really in love. Sooner or later you get hurt. For me, it was a little later. Sigh. I just miss all those good times Joe and I had you know? We had a lot of them. But then again, we had a lot of bad times too. And then my parents were a factor to our breaking up. It was probably for the best though. I mean, now that I look back on it, he wasn't the best out there. Even my best friend thought I could do better. Though she never said anything until after Joe and I broke up. At least she kept it to herself unlike some people. *cough my parents cough* But whatever. It's done and over with now. No use dwelling on it right? And besides, I'm going to a different school this year so there'll be tons of more guys to fall in love with. Mwhahahahaha. Love ya! *mwah*
