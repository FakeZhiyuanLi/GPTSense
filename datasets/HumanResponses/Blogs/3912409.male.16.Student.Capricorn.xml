      This morning I had to get up early because me, Wes, and BJ had decided to go downtown today. After I got up I had some oatmeal and noodles because I love noodles, mainly because they're noodily delicious. Then after I ate I biked down to BJ's house and when I got there he was playing an   ILLEGAL   version of Vice City, tsk tsk, but it was kind of funny how there were a lot of really bad drivers in that game. During the game, BJ had to race a bunch of people on motorcycles and BJ was losing until all of the other racers crashed and then BJ just passed them and won the race.  Eventually Wes showed up and he brought along Bret; so after a couple minutes we all headed down to the college and waited for the bus. It took a long time for the bus to get there.... and when it did arrive Ashley and Stephany were apparently riding the same bus for a couple hours.  I DON'T LIKE ASHLEY . When we got off the bus we were at the mall and we walked down to Future Shop where I bought meself a new anime DVD and it came in a box which is all fancy and special is currently sitting on my desk beside my monitor. Wes bought a DVD of Space Balls, which is a pretty good movie because of how stupid some things are. Wes also bought  THREE  new games... and apparently he got two new ones yesterday... so......... holy crap Wes...  We were going to go watch a movie, but apparently............. we didn't...........  When I got home I had some good ol' chef boyardee, lol. Then me, Wes, BJ, and Bret were supposed to play Warcraft 3 together, but Wes was being kind of stupid, so he didn't play with us. And basicly we just played that till about 10:30.  I watched two episodes of S-cry-ed and ummm... yeah... I guess that's about it for today.            o yeah and.....  ASHLEY IS LOUD AND ANNOYING!

      ok, I actually had more stuff to say yesterday... but I was just way to lazy at the moment; And today I really didn't do much except play games all day... and I'm not going to tell you what happened in every game, so this may be short.  Well this morning I woke up and I ate meself some cereal, some mighty fine cheerios. After that I went upstairs to my room and onto the computer I went. I didn't do much for awhile except go around to a couple sites. After awhile me and BJ started to play some Warcraft 3 and we did that for a couple hours. Then Cookie came on MSN and me, Wes, Cookie, and BJ were in a convo.... and BJ didn't exactly "fit into" our conversation, mainly because when me, Wes, and Cookie get together our IQ usually drops a point or two. Basicly what happened in the convo was that I slapped Cookie with my eyebrow after she licked it and Wes made a fort inside of Cookie's fort which is inside of her linen closet. Cookie later called BJ a grumpy Gus and logged off. By this time I was starting to get hungry, so I went downstairs and boiled up some noodles for me to eat; I then drank some chocolate milk... mainly because... I like chocolate milk.  After eating me food, I watched the new YuGiOh japanese RAW... lol... I find it funny how we are never going to get the same show that they have, because it's to "violent" for North America. Ummmmm..... o yeah; we were going to go to the pool... but I didn't really want to and Wes couldn't go becaues he had to "pack" for his camping trip. Ash and Steph were gonna come swimming, but decided not to. We eventually ended up........ not going. Then me and BJ continued to play Warcraft 3 and this time we finally got Wes to join in. We have to force Wes to do anything which gets really annoying.......  Ummm...... yeah... k... so I'm off to watch me anime till I fall asleep.  *EDIT*  ok, so I just read BJ's blog and I'm going to have to put this in because.... I don't know.  The following is from Birdy's Daily:  "yeah.. going downtown tomorrow apparently but i dunno what for.. or when.. cuz wes never gives complete instructions... DAMN YOU WES... YOU N YOUR GENGER BREAD MAN... hahaha Wes cant spell.."  O YEAH! well you don't spell perfectly either! and at least I try to have  some  correct grammar in me blog!............................................................. :p.............. k just kidding.... lol  Also, BJ has stolen me template and I am now going to sue him for a gummi bear.

      lol, k shortest blog so far... but nothing actually happened today....    Well... today was yet another fairly boring day. I had tennis for a couple hours during the afternoon. I guess I forgot to go to my orthadontist thing this morning, which means that I have to go next thursday at 9:00. I was supposed to do the dishes and fold some laundry before I left for tennis... but I didn't :p, so I had to do the dishes a couple hours ago and I still haven't folded the laundry. Ok, so at the moment me and Cookie are listening to the Baby Baluga song together. After I got home I didn't really do much, I ate some snacks and stuff. O yeah, and I also ate a popsicle! lol after that I had some craisins. Eventually me and BJ started to play some Crackwarz and he made me join his little clan type thingy.... so yeah.... other then that I've mainly just been talking to Cookie all day.

      *yawn*, not much happened this morning. I mainly just sat in my chair in my room all morning and watched tennis on TV. By the time the tennis match was over it was about 2:00 - 2:30 and after that.... I kinda just watched some more TV...     Later, I got one of those survey things from BJ.... and it was 178 questions long! So after reading it I filled it out meself... lol and I think it ended up taking me an hour or so to fill it out. And much much later... Cookie finally got on MSN, so we started talking. Then Cookie sent me her survey thing, so I read that. And after that she sent me yet another little survey type thing, it was just about how much I knew her and that kind of stuff. lol but what was scary is that we had so many of the same answers :p... and after that BJ sent me the same thing, and I called him slutty and said he'd marry George W. Bush (HA! got him back for you Cookie).      Ok, I said that I'd put this in, because Cookie wrote this just for me............ and BJ I guess....     Twas a normal day in the land or Tir na knogg.. The hens were out pecking at the grain... the pigs were bathing in their bowls of mud and other great substances.     Twas the same day the small girl decided to venture into the world, decided to treat that day, the day she came of age, as a very special day.    Slowly she stepped away from the small cottage that had been of hers and her fathers for the duration of her life. She had only ever ventured meer steps away from it's safe walls, but today was her 15th birthday and she decided to do that of a different sort.    Slowly she walked towards the rickety fence that held that of an ass and steed. Carefully she coaxed the horses closer, she ridden him many times in the small dirt ring by her home, but never into town. Carefully she brushed him out, and then put on his bridle. Hiking her skirts up she mounted him bareback, her cloak flowing out behind her like that of a cape. Expertly she turned the horse, did a couple of warm up excercises, then raced down the gravel road in the direction of town.    Soon she was in the small town of Tir na Knogg, many shops and people bustled about. Never before had she seen anyone other then her father, and his mistress who occasionally visited from the small town. She had heard many stories of the town, but it was different then she had expected. Carefully she took in the sounds of the voices, and the clip clopping of hoof on cobblestone. She listened to the melodic splashing of the fountain that sat in the middle of the town, a circlular road running around it. Shops sat all along the road, people approaching them, and leaving them. People of all different statures and appearances, some leaving with goods, others leaving looking rather out of it. Slowly she glanced around at all the other horses, and then walked her mount over to the shop with the wooden sign with the insignia of a fork and knife.     She dismounted and tied the horse next to that of a small pony, on the hitching post. "You wait here Ganalon." She whispered in the horses ear, as she stroaked his thick dark neck.    Carefully she opened the door, taking in with anticipation the sights, smells, and sounds. Ancey and excited she walked over to the bar, her body shaking with excitement so that she had to grip onto the wooden counter to keep herself from falling down. The barista came over, cleaning a wooden tankard on the gringey apron that was tied around her hip.     "What can I do you for, luv." She said in a thick accent, her frizzy blond braids falling down over her shoulders across her chest as she rested one leg, and leaned on the opposing hip.    Smiling with deep excitement, anticipation bubbling in her like water in a cauldron over a hot fire. Taking a deep breath in and exclaimed...                                                                        "Get me one bowl of mushroom and macaroni soup."     Ummm... not much else happened today.... except for talking to Cookie for awhile about.... stuff?.... AND WES!!! DIDN'T I ASK YOU TO GET ME A DRINK?!?!?!

      This morning I was supposed to get up at 8:00 and take some boxes out to the street for the garbage guys to take.... so I set my alarm for 8:00.... and I eventually woke up at 11:30. When I woke up I turned on MSN and started talking to Cookie and BJ. Eventually I had to go to tennis, so I left at around 1:00. I only played two games today, one against Erika and I was winning 5-0 and then she gave up. My second game was a lot closer, I was playing against John and he was winning for the first half of the game.... but then I won five games in a row and beat him.    When I got home I made some toast with peanut butter and apple sauce, which is really good :D. Eventually Cookie started talking to me and she told me that she went on a helicopter. I've been on one and they're pretty fun. Ummm.... Cookie also made her own  urlLink blog . O yeah, I have a picture of the Care Bears shirt that Cookie made         isn't it great

      I got up at around 11:30 today because I had to get up at around 7:00 for the last two days. When I woke up this morning to find out that I had yet another female stalker on MSN, if there are any girls reading this that are thinking about stalking me... please just save me some time and shoot yourself in the head. So after talking to her for a couple minutes I said that I'd be right back.... and then I deleted/blocked her.    After awhile I went around to the usual sites that I check, and I downloaded the new Yu-Gi-Oh episode (214) and the new RockMan EXE Access (42). Lately I've been watching a lot of japanese RAWs (pure japanese, no subtitles). The Yu-Gi-Oh was pretty great, the main bad guy got killed by a Blue Eyes White Dragon, o yeah, in the current episodes it all takes place way back in ancient egypt when all the monsters were real. Ummm... o yeah and the person that summoned the Blue Eyes White Dragon died too.    In RockMan EXE Access not a lot happened.... ummm... except ネト (pronounced Net-o) went out on a date with メイル (translated directly It would sound like may-ee-roo, but it is actually pronounced May-Roo) and then SwordMan came in and went..... "Grrrrrr". And ネト did something called a "Class Fusion" and fused together with RockMan. O yeah and all this is happening in the real world, not in a computer. lol and umm... RockMan basicly saved the day.... the end.    Today I finally tried burning Wes and Bret their DVDs of Hikaru No Go (awesome show, my favourite shounen). The whole thing ended up taking a couple hours. The first program I tried using was the one that came with the DVD burner... and that failed horribly. I made a nice little menu that had an intro and everything. When I went to burn the whole thing on to a DVD it said that there wasn't enough space on the DVD.... so I checked how much the file ended up being.... and it was 33 gigs.... which doesn't fit on to one DVD. So I ended up just making a data disc type thing, Wes can just copy and paste them off of the DVD... no fancy-ness for him.    Eventually I went over to BJ's house and we played Tales of Symphonia for awhile and then we headed on down to the pool. Wes wouldn't come into the steam room for some reason, maybe it scared him. And umm... we were at the pool for a couple hours..... then went home.    After I got home I ate me dinner and went upstairs to my room and talked with Cookie for a couple minutes.... we talked about the usual, that being of Care Bear related things. I downloaded a new episode of one of the many anime that I watch weekly.... and I guess that's about all I did today.

      Ok, first of all it has come ot my attention that my blog may have a giant space in it... this is not my fault.... this is  YOUR  fault for using Internet Explorer and not Mozilla.    Today I had to get up at *yawn* 7:30, which is not exactly fun happy party times. Eventually I ended up at the tennis courts and it was almost time for my first match, semi-finals YAY! go me :D. It was against Jack Fletcher, who I like playing against because we are almost even in strength and he is not very serious when he plays so we can make jokes and kinda just play around. Jack ended up winning the game, but meh... 'cause it was a fun match. Then.... I waited for about 4 hours until my doubles game, I'm just gonna blame that whole game on my partner Nick.    I then flew home on my banana fueled rocket pickle and went "gobble gobble" to the food and then went upstairs and on to the computer. BJ then asked me if I wanted to play crackwarz (Warcraft 3), and I eventually said yes. lol we completely won the game that we played, then I got off......... and we talked about going to the pool tomorrow. Wes says he has to do "stuff" as usual, but he said he might come but I don't think he will. I'll probably end up going to BJ's tomorrow and playing Tales of Symphonia.    Random stuff I forgot to mention:  Me and BJ played this Magic: The Gathering online type game thingy, and after I figured out how to get it to work we played a game. I lost horribly because I had nothing that I could possibly use in my hand. Then in the next game I used a different deck and I killed him.... MWAHAHAHA!!!    While I was playing the Magic online game thingy Cookie was talking to me and telling me about her new shirts that she got. lol and she "got" a care bears t-shirt, and I say "got" because she just wrote "care bears" on a piece of paper and put it on her shirt.... but it still makes me jealous.... because I love anything to do with Care Bears.

      Yes well today was an incredibly fun day indeed, I played in the Ben Bellamy tournament today. I got up at 7:30 and eventually wound up at the tennis courts at around 8:15-8:30. Once I got there I kinda just hung around for an hour, which was fine I guess. My first game was fairly even, we kept getting into deuce, but I he ended up winning it. Ummm.... o yeah, so the next game I had to play was against......... WES!...... lol yeah, so that was a free win for me :D. so then I we waited for many hours in the club house, which was actually kinda fun as it usually is. It's just to bad that they took out the foosbal tablel, and do you wanna know why they took it out............ well they took it out because they were afraid the club house would fall apart with the weight of the foosball table :S..... lol yeah its not exactly the greatest club house, because when your sitting out on the balcony and someone's walking around on the balcony.... the whole balcony shakes :'(. Eventually around 4:30 I had to play my first doubles game of the day. Ok one thing I have to say is that I love my serve.... because we were playing against Ettian, who is visiting from France and also won first place for last weeks tournament, and even he said "holy **** what was that?!" so I laughed after that :P. The rest of my games are being played tomorrow.    After the tournament was over everyone went over to the Bellamy's house. When I got there Wes was already in the pool getting beaten up by Erika and Bobby-Anne, so I laughed and then changed and jumped in the pool. lol ok so one thing I have to say is that.... Wes jumping over me and doing a cannon ball is pretty scary, first of all because he just started charging at me and I didn't know what he was gonna do..... then he jumped over me and then I cried.... lol. After all the little kids got into the pool and started spazzing out me, Wes, Erika, and Bobby-Anne got out :P. Then we ate our burgers and our thingy that came from Dairy Queen, then  Bobby-Anne  suggested we go back into the pool.... so me, Wes, and Erika jump in.... and guess what.... BOBBY-ANNE DIDN'T GO IN!!! so you know what we did... me and Wes grabbed her and dragged her in. After we laughed at Bobby-Anne for about ten seconds, she got out. So me and Wes dragged her back in, then she got out..... then Wes pushed her in with her towel, and that was pretty funny because when it was laying on the ground Erika said "It looks like a pile of crap" and indeed it did..... mainly because it was a brown towel :P. Not much happened after that until we all left.    Since Wes didn't have a ride home I think he had to walk all the way, which is really far for walking. Ummm.... and yeah.... I think that's all that I did today.        FUN INDEED TODAY WAS!!!

      I didn't do a whole lot today other then go to Wes' for awhile. When I got there we played Red Faction for about an hour. lol they have a bot that they made that has 100 accuracy, so when it gets a sniper rifle... that kinda sucks, BUT if it gets a Rail Gun..... thats just stoopid, because the Rail Gun can shoot through the walls. They also made a guy that has max life and max damage amplifier... so it can almost kill you in one hit with a pistol, and the only way I can kill him is with a grenade launcher. :s    Yeah, well... after we did all that Wes wanted to show me his Neopets account (I so didn't care) and he has all these "super rare" items.... so I walked away and went into Bret's room. Me and Bret "watched" the X vol. 1 DVD that he rented, and I say "watched" because I really wasn't paying attention to what was happening. Then Wes came in and we watched my S-cry-ed vol. 1 DVD... Wes went "Ha" and I went "Ha" and then it was about 6:00. Wes' Mom made some food, sausages, potatoes, and spaghetti noodles. Wes went "gobble" and then I went "gobble". Wes continued to play the game that he rented, Tales of Symphonia, which I thought was kind of a funny game from what I saw. Apparently you can get a bunch of different rank titles and the first one Wes got was "Klutz" and later he got "Combo Newbie". Just before I left Bret made me eat a brownie with an attempted face made out of whipped cream. So I ate the brownie and left as fast as I could.    Ummm.... everything from then till now is kind of a blank.... :p k byez

      mmm k..... so today I had tennis and O....M...G..... was it hot.... and when I was playing my teacher she would only let me be on the side that the sun was facing, which means that I had to play almost the whole game looking at the sun and thats not fun. We also had a new kid join the club today and he says that he has only been playing for three days, if thats true then he is really good. I think that he is as good if not better then Wes, who has been playing for maybe three months now, and when I told Wes that he got mad at me :'(... lol but meh.    Apparently a couple days ago the forecast for this weekends weather was supposed to be 35°C and then yesterday they changed that to 37°C and now there is a heat stroke warning for this weekend. So thats really not going to be fun playing a tennis tournament with a heat stroke warning. BUT.... that means that we get to stay inide the club house and watch the TV!... but it doesn't get any channels.... it only has a black screen with the top half all purple (YAY! fun).    I still have my S-cry-ed Vol. 2 DVD to watch, I guess the main reason that I haven't watched it yet is because I don't have my DVD player set up to my new tv yet. It's not really hard to do.... in fact it will probably only take a minute, but then again..... it's still work. I guess since I'm talking about anime I'll just say that I finished watching Naruto episode 92 a couple minutes ago, and it was good but I think the next one will be better. O yeah, I have to either go fix my downstairs computer which has the DVD burner on it so I can burn all of my anime on my computer to DVDs or else I have to start deleting a bunch soon. I have 35 gigs of anime  and I'm getting low on gigs left on my computer... well not really, 'cause I have more then 20 gigs left, but it still seems low to me :p

      Well I got up at 11:00, which is actually kinda early for me 'cause I get up at like noon usually.... and eventually Wes came over so we could bike down to tennis together and register him for the tournament this weekend. k, well we get to the Rec. Center and I ask Wes if he has enough money to register and he says "yeah I brought $20", then he looks in his backpack and it seems that he only brought $6... so I start laughing at him and we left. Then we got to the tennis courts and we both had no water so we biked over to the mall and picked some up. I just got normal sized water bottle...... but Wes...... he had to buy a jug of water..... I laughed at him again and we left. After all that I picked up my package on the other side of the mall that I ordered quite a while, but since it wasn't in stock I had to wait which wasn't fun.    yeah yeah... so eventually I got home and me and my friend went to I, Robot. We met up with some other friends when we got there, and it was a really good movie I give it a thumbs up      After the movie we went over to McDonalds and Miranda (I call her Cookie) bought a happy meal type thing... a grilled cheese and a toy..... and that was quite the dumb toy. Eventually I got home and ate some food and started typing this..............    k, sleeping time now

      Well, not much happened today... I  finally  got my package in, containing my S-cry-ed vol. 2 DVD. Now I can watch that then then my vol. 3 DVD that has just been sitting on my DVD shelf.    I went to register for the tennis tournament that's happening this weekend.... lol I never liked the people working at the Rec. Center, they don't seem terribly happy. I hope that I get teamed up with the right person for my doubles... I don't know my partners last name so...... yeah.... I hope they figure it out.    I finally installed a game on my computer after my friends became annoying enough. We played Warcraft 3 TFT for a couple hours.................... then I wanted to shoot myself in the head. I can't handle playing a game for to long, except for Mario Party. lol when a new Mario Party comes out my friend rents it and the four of us play a 50 turn game, which usually last about 5 - 8 hours.    o yeah.... so I found out that the earthquake that happend last night was a 6.1 magnitude. The red dot is basicly where I live.

      As I write this right now My bed is shaking and I can feel the house shaking a little too.... kinda scary :(.... but It's starting to stop. There hasn't been an earthqauke here in a couple years.......    k, it's over now, but that was kinda scary. It was nothing serious but my bed was shaking pretty good (weeeeee like a roller coaster.... k not really).    Just thought I'd write this down while it was happening.    The end.... sleep now.

      ok, so I had the first tournament today... I didn't do terribly well in the singles but I did alright in the doubles. We had some people come from towns that are fairly close come and play... they're so much better then us :(... we also had some one come from France, he was really good. I won my first singles game I had, although it wasn't really hard because it was against someone I've played many times, I beat him 8-0 (yet again) :D. After that I played one of the kids from out of town... holy Jebus munkyz that kid has a hard serve (he came in second place), I got hit by one of them and it hurt. So that was the end of singles for me, then I had to play doubles. In my first game I sprained my neck which... kinda hurt, so we lost that game, but went into the conciliation round and came in second place for that. The last doubles game I played was the best game of the whole day.    Hahahaha... ok one thing that I must say is that my friend Wes was playing in the girls doubles tournament... I laughed at him good. He said he would have worn his high heels but they would have given him blisters, and I don't remember what he said about wearing a skirt.... but I remember laughing at him after that.    Yeah k, well after the tournament was over I biked home and took a shower and then collapsed on my bed. Eventually I got up and had some more pizza.... ummmm.... again.... 'cause I had pizza last night and this morning for breakfast and for lunch at the tennis club and again tonight.    So I just finished downloading Naruto 91 and I'll watch that in an hour probably and I'm still waiting for my Hikaru no Go 2004 New Year's Special to finish. Tonight I'll finish watching the Hikaru no Go episodes that I skipped, the ones that were just side stories and had nothing to do with the actual story.    k, I think I'm about done for tonight...

Well I had tennis lessons for the last time till my tournament on saturday. I was playing horrible.... but I was still undefeated :D... I was trying to play Wes, but he gave up fairly quickly.  I watched another 5 straight episodes of Hikaru no Go last night..... errrr.... this morning.... errrrr... until 1:30-ish in the morning. I'm almost done the series, I'm on episode 66 I believe and I am currently downloading the rest of the series. I've got about 20 episodes of other anime that I haven't watched... so I better watch those soon, but I'm so obsessed with Hikaru no Go at the moment.  lol I had to make my own supper tonight.... I made some hotdogs and french fries *thumbs up*, aren't I the fancy chef.    Hmmmm.... there's nothing on tv at the moment... maybe I'll go watch some of those fansubbed anime that are collecting on my computer. Yeah, k... so I guess I'm off for the moment.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   lol I'm not sure if this test was made for girls... but.... yah whatever     urlLink     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     HAHAHA!!!... thats pretty funny   You're Exotic Dancer Barbie.

      Went over to Wes and Bret's today, we ended up playing games all day (big suprise). We started out with Red Faction for a couple hours.... Wes was being a camping whore... he hid in a corner and used a gun that could shoot through the walls. After I gave up on that I went on to both Wes and Bret's computers and deleted Internet Explorer and installed Mozilla FireFox. Bret was telling me that his mom now plays  urlLink Neopets  and Counter Strike... lol so now they can play Counter Strike together.... and it would be really funny if their mom was some "1337 h4xx0r" as some 10 year old losers would say. Anybluh... after I messed around on their computers for awhile we went and played some Perfect Dark on the N64, Me and Wes VS. Bret... I think Bret got kinda mad, cause me and Wes kept disarming, which makes him really dizzy..... then some one shot him while he couldn't see anything on his screen.... but I'm not sure who kept doing that... *shifty eyes*... and eventually I went home.  lol, for some reason I downloaded the new japanese Yu-Gi-Oh episode 212... it makes me mad at how edited the english version is. -First of all there IS swearing in the japanese version -In the english version Bakura sounds like some old guy, but in the japanese version he ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A 14 YEAR OLD KID!!! -The Japanese version also seems much... darker (in an evil kind of)  So I was trying to send 25 episodes of Hikaru no Go to my downstairs computer that has the DVD burner on it... but something crapped out, so I gotta figure something out, otherwise Bret will want his DVD-RW's back... and I dont really wanna give them back (he gave me 30 or so for free).

      Well after an incredibly boring day yesterday I finally went outside to go to my tennis lessons...  This is kinda what I looked like after leaving my house this morning:  urlLink     Lets see... I was undefeated yet again for tennis, which is a good thing because I have a tournament on saturday, AT 8:00!!! I've been getting up at noon almost everyday since school ended so getting up at 8:00 may be a bit of a challenge. Hopefully our club wont be do horrible again... we've came in last for the last couple years I think. I was watching Big Brother a little while ago and one of the guys said something that I thought was pretty funny, "There's no alliances allowed.... but mine" I thought that was pretty funny. Well not much else that I really did today, I mean I got up at noon, went to tennis at 1:15 and got home at 5:00 and collapsed on my bed. Which reminds me... HOLY JEBUS PIE!!! it was hot today... which also reminds me, Wes is sick today (HAHA!) so he was sleeping in bed all day, which he probably would have done anyway if he didn't have to go to tennis also.

      I've finally decided to make one of these blog things, I was just updating my MSN profile and thought that I might as well make one of these. Today I spent most of the day reading the archive of  urlLink  Ctr+Alt+Del  many funny comics at that site. I bought a new TV for my room two days ago, it all started out with me just getting a haircut, but I ended up with a new TV :S. My old TV was a fairly old 13" non-flat screen, but my new one is a 20" flat screen with all the plugins that I needed. I now can hook my computer into the TV to watch my fansubbed anime that I download (35 gigs of it on my computer at the moment), I get a much clearer picture now :D. I didn't do a whole lot today. I would have liked to gone and played some tennis, because of my two tournaments I have within the next two weeks. Well I guess this is good enough for my first post, hope you had fun reading about my life :P  This is my new tv that I just bought, not the greatest pic but whatever I just thought I'd show you.  urlLink

      Ok so I'm in Calgary now, which means I'm not always able to update me blog, so I'll type as much stuff as I can remember.  When I left for the airport on friday I had to go to the new airport, which I didn't even know existed, and I guess I almost missed the flight because there was a huge line up. I slept the whole time on the plane, like I usually do, and when I got to Calgary I had to wait like twenty minutes for my luggage to arrive. Me and my dad went to eat some A&amp;W, and we eventually ended up at the new house. The house is really close to the city, so it's great :D. My brother and his friends were here for the weekend too, which was kinda good and kinda bad. They have many DVDs to watch which is great, we watched like two movies a day lol. On saturday me and my Dad went to the IMax and watched Spider-Man 2, and that was lots of fun because I've never been to an IMax before.  On monday we all had to drive down to Saskatchewan, which was really really really not fun. It was a seven hour drive to get there. I was incredibly bored for the last couple days... my Dad made me come with him while he worked, he had to check out a bunch of the oil wells... or something... I'm not really sure, all I know is that it's almost an hour drive between each well. My brother and his friend are currently still in Saskatchewan and are going to work there till the 14th which means I get the basement all to myself till saturday. I really didn't have much to do while I was in the truck for most of the day, I had my Dad's laptop, but the battery only lasts for a little while.  Umm... and today we drove back to Calgary, and this time the drive was slightly shortened... but I think that's because my Dad was driving forty kilometers over the limit :s... which means it only took five hours instead of seven lol. and ummm... not really much else to say I guess... other then I WAS REALLY BORED!  Me and my Dad are going to the Calgary Science Centre tomorrow, I'm hoping that will be fun. I'm thinking of stopping off at Electronic Boutique tomorrow too, maybe I'll get Doom 3 or something lol. Yeah... umm... so I guess I'll go eat me lasagna and cupcake lol :p..... byez!

      The first thing you may notice is that I have changed my template, I was having problems with the other one and I guess it's time for a change. You may now leave comments if you wish.  This morning I had an orthodontist appointment at 9:00, which means I had to get up early :(. I was playing around on the computer till some one came on MSN. Eventually I had to leave to go to tennis, and when I got there, there was some thunder. I think we were only there for an hour, I did get to play one game, and I bageled him :p which means he didn't win a single game against me. It eventually started to rain, so tennis got cancelled and I had to bike home in the rain :(. When I got home I started talking to Cookie (big suprise there, :p). There was some cheek licking and rib poking invovled, lol. I played around with some taskbar customizing program type thingy, but I deleted it.... but I'm not sure why........... I want it back now, lol. I was eating trailmix and I spilled it on my floor :(... so I just started eating off of the floor :p.  I have to do some packing soon, but I don't think I have very much stuff to pack other than my clothes. I'm hoping to do some shopping while in calgary.... lol and that's most likely going to happen. I don't know when my next blog post will be but... ummmmm... just wait in suspence because I know reading my blog is the best thing that will happen to you during the entire day.  to be continued...

      Ok, so I got up at 11:00 this morning and had some oatmeal and went on the computer. I spent most of this morning installing World of Warcraft and talking to people on MSN. I played Warcraft 3 for a little while and then went to BJ's. We played some games there, wrestling, sould calibor, super smash bros. and I attempted to talk to Cookie, but grumpy gus wouldn't let me. Dimitri made some chicken burgers and we ate that, and then I stole a pop from the fridge. BJ got his information from the Art Institute and I just sent my thingy today that asks for information on some classes. Eventually me, BJ, and Dimitri went down to the pool for a couple hours, and it was much much more fun then when we went yesterday. lol.... umm.... saw some hot chicks then we went home. When I got home I had a burger and finished installing World of Warcraft, and started talking to Cookie.  I'm going to be gone from the 6th till around the 29th, BUT DON'T WORRY!!! my dad supposedly bought a brand new fancy computer which means I can still be go on the computer and talk to everyone and play games. I can't wait till I leave because... ummm.... don't know, lol :p...

      Ok so today I had a driving lesson at 10:00 and I set my alarm for 9:00 but it seems that it doesn't work, so I ended up waking up at 9:45. I drove to campbell river and back. On the way to campbell river I drove on the old highway and on the way back I drove on the new highway which is much better. That took two hours to complete, and then I got home and had some good ol' instant oatmeal :p. I talked to BJ for a couple minutes and then I left for tennis. Not much happened at tennis, we mainly just did a bunch of drills today. Wes has gone camping for two weeks so he wasn't at tennis today, so my instructor was kind of sad because Wes is the "Mobile Pharmacy", lol he always brings ibuprofen, tylenol..... and many other things. My partner Nick also wasn't at tennis, so it ended up being pretty boring, although I can always entertain myself by joking around with Erika (mostly inults lol).  When I got home I was really hungry because I hadn't really eaten anything today so I "cooked" some Chef Boyardee and some noodles. BJ started to whine about going to the pool, I really didn't terribly want to go, but meh... it wasn't that bad. We met up with Ashley and Steph at the pool and apparently today was "not being annoying day" or something like that... it kind of worked I guess, they only yelled once but that was because there was some kid that kept looking at them under water while wearing his "super pervert goggles", lol. Umm... went down water slides, swam in pool, swam in other pool, sat in sauna, bought some stuff at vending machines.... went home.  BJ burned me a copy of World of Warcraft, which will apparently take me about three hours to install.... so I'll do that tomorrow. And then I had some craisins, marshmellows, and cracker type things.... watched some anime.... updated blog.... and now sleep. O YEAH!!! AND COOKIE STOLE MY TEMPLATE!!!... well..... GRRRR TO YOU COOKIE!!!......... lol :p, just kidding... your still loved......... I guess.......

      ok well yesterday was fairly boring during the day; me, BJ, Wes, and Bret mainly played games till 3:00-ish. Ummmm... so yeah... that was about all that happened during the day.  At around 6:00 I headed down to BJ's house and Wes and Bret were already there. BJ was playing Megaman and he kept dieing... so I laugh at you, HA! A couple minutes later Dimitri showed up with Starsky and Hutch and Mario Party. We played Mario Party for like... 10 minutes until..... umm... we stopped playing it. When our pizza arrived we all sat down and watched Starsky and Hutch, it was my second time seeing it but it was still great. By the time it was over it might have been around 10:00-11:00... I really don't know what time it actually was, but meh. Ummm... I think I watched Wes or Bret play Warcraft for awhile... or me and Dimitri may have been playing games, but eventually we all ended up around the computer.  lol, why were there so many drunk girls.....  We started out on webcam with Ash and Steph and....... well..... they were drunk. They were dancing around all slutty like and they were sick and throwing up. Wes suggested they go to the hospital or something but they said no to that. And ummm... then we moved on to Cookie and her friends, they were drunk too... except for Cookie I believe. lol and yes, happy fun times. I sure hope nobody took any pictures of anything...... *shifty eyes*...... lol :p. lol and I hope my "dancing" in the "skirt" entertained you girls..... haha... I don't think so. And was my face really red? 'cause it was kinda hot in that small room with five guys and no windows....  When we all decided to go to sleep...... we ended up watching another movie at around 2:30. I watched the beginning of The Bourne Identity but fell asleep possibly somewhere in the middle of it. I think I woke up when the movie was over, and the others went to sleep.... and then woke up a couple minutes later. Wes, Dimitri, and possibly Bret stayed up all night playing games. When I woke up they were already on the computer and drinking their coffee, except for Bret who was still sleeping on the couch. I woke him up by plugging his nose.... lol... and he didn't exactly like that when he got up. I watched Wes on the computer for a couple minutes until BJ got up and then we played some games, possibly for 15 minutes. I then came home and am very tired because of the lack of sleep due to Wes and Dimitri.           lol and yes Cookie, I did see you when you had no shirt on and fell..... lol and you fell very fast :p
