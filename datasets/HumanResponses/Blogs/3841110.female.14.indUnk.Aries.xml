      Last night the five of us got together. We played the game of Life, but we didn't finish it because all of us got hungry. So we had a midnight snack at 12:30. (We're trying out our new blog and we don't know what to say.)

      Hi! I don't really know what to write....

Everything here seems so boring now, after Singapore. We've been going to all these places and were really busy and now we're just doing nothing. 

Sorry to whoever lost their cellphone and feels that life is meaningless. Hope you're feeling better now.

Good luck with any exams you're taking! (If you're taking any...) Remember to sign either your name or STEMK!!! 

C'ya later!

      Well, my sister and I made it back to the U.S. I'm extremely tired and I haven't really done anything! Guess what happened when we first came to Indianapolis? We found out that they had lost our luggage in Chicago AGAIN! And this time it wasn't only one luggage, it was all three of the bags we had checked in. The flight was okay, but really boring and tiring. On a different subject...who posted the last two entries? I can't figure it out! I will definitely take care of my belongings seeing as the digital camera we brought with us to Singapore got stolen in the first few days we were there! Well I've got to go.

       Hi, everyone!!  I haven't been busy @ all.   I really envy all of you because you have school to keep you occupied...  how is life?   Glad you could finally use the Internet, Tiff.   I've mostly been reading because I haven't anything else to do.   I don't really know what to say, but I hope you all are having a good summer.   School is starting soon.   I'm kind of worried, but not too much.   I'm kind of scared of what my teachers will be like.   My sister keeps on telling me all these stories about her gym teacher.   But I've met her, and she doesn't seem all that bad, so...  I haven't really been anywhere since I came back from Singapore.   We might go to Tenessee or Chicago!!   We've been to Chicago loads of times for piano exams, but we've never been to Tenessee.   I hope we go because I'm really bored. I think I'll die of boredom.   Has anything been going on lately?   We have this summer reading program here.   We normally participate in it, even if we go to Singapore.   Usually, we bring the books with us.   This year, we didn't though, so we're really far behind.   The program ends in early August, and my sis and I haven't even started!   There's this card, and when you read a book, then you bring the book in and claim points.   The # of points depends on what kind of book it is.   You win all these prizes and things.   Some of the stuff is really cool, but some are really cheap.   Oh well, it's not like the just start handing out expensive prizes.   Has any of you seen each other recently?   Do you have exams?   I know, this is getting kind of long, but I like the multi-colors.    I'm rattling on and on about nothing. Oh well, there's nothing to say anyway.   Except  at I just told you. Oh well, I'm really bored.   Are you really bored over there?   Normally, I have too much homework to be bored.   I wait and wait for the holidays during the school year...  and then when it comes, it's like, this is what I wanted?   I'm rattling again.&nbsp;  I haven't talked to any of my friends over the phone for months.   How is everyone's families? Is everybody doing all right?   Do you guys stll have the photos we took at the photo booth?   We definitely have to do that again next time.   Here, the photo booths are really small.   They don't have as many cool things.   A storm is coming.   The power might go out any minute.   Everyone wants me to get off the computer.   She's going to read this the minute I get off.   Maybe.   Well G2G. C'ya later! Misha

      Well, nothing much really has happened since the last time I posted, except that I went out with a friend on Monday and had violin lessons on Tuesday. My violin teachers are moving to Alabama, so the next few lessons will be the last ones that I have with them. My teacher is in the Symphony Orchestra as is his wife (my sister's teacher). Yesterday for lessons I played two and three quarters pages of an eleven page song! It's a rather nice concerto, the only thing about it is that it is fast. Anyway, my sis and I spent the whole afternoon cleaning out the closets and the house...that kind of stuff. On the blog, what do you guys think of an ocean theme? If you don't want that, please make suggestions and I will try and do my best to come up with something. School starts in three and a half weeks! :-O Wish I was still in Singapore....~Sasha

       Hey, everyone! Sorry, Esther, didn't see your name on the first entry, so I didn't know who wrote it. Really sorry about your cell phone, Kexin. Maybe you'll get a new one soon. The whole week's going to be pretty much boring for me. My sister and I got scrapbooks. I'm starting with my birth and working my way up, and my sister's is only on high school. It's loads of fun, and you should do it if you have free time and don't already have one. I kind of wish I had school to occupy my time!! It's kind of boring around the house!!! G2G...C'ya later!!!!! Misha

      I couldn't get the picture thing to work....so I'll eventually link one entry of the blog to the site that I created...........also, the blog doesn't do paragraphing (or I haven't figured out how to yet)&nbsp;so.......my whole entry is one big glob of text...all I can say is, have fun reading! Hehe, hang on, maybe I can get it fixed! If you read it and it's in paragraphs then it's fixed...yay! Anyway, Love ya lots, ~Sasha ...................Later....Well the thing kinda works in bullets, but I've got to figure out another way as the text is small, oh well, I'll do it later...got to go!

        Well I'm really really sorry that you lost your cellphone Kexin....well look on the bright side, at least you aren't the only one who lost something...I think my parents are still a little mad at me for the camera thing. Although even my aunt says that it was stolen off of me, and not that I was careless and dropped it. Anyway, I'm glad they don't really mention it anymore at home otherwise they would make me feel even worse about what happened. 
  I've got some school work that needs to get done before school starts, that's rather boring, Social Studies, and some English book assignment. Other than reviewing my math, I basically don't have a lot of things I'm going to do before school reopens. I do feel sorry, though, for the three of you who are already in school....although, sometimes when I'm REALLY bored, I wish that we had school to fill in the time. 
  Tomorrow I am going out with a friend that I haven't seen in awhile to see and movie and have lunch together. It should be tons of fun! Well, this has been a loong entry. I'll post again really soon and let you know how everything went! 
  Lots of love to everyone! 
~Sasha 
  P.s. I'm working on a&nbsp;blog layout...would an ocean theme be okay? The layout thing is rather complicated so it will take me a long time to put this together. I'm going to see today if I can post a picture from the time that Tiffany and Esther were here for Thanksgiving. I will send you the site address (via email) where I will soon store all these pics but right now they are practically inaccessible from the outsiders!

      Hi cousins! We got back from Nashville safely! It was a lot of fun, and we did a whole ton of stuff comparitively speaking as we only really spent one and a half days there. We visited this Country Music Hall of Fame museum, and we went shopping at this huge shopping center called Opry Mills. Of course, it's not as big as a lot of the major shopping centers you guys have in Singapore but I still thought it was fun. We ate at the Aquarium and the Rainforest cafe, which are both restaurants that are "dining adventures." The Rainforest Cafe was pretty cool though, the inside of the restaurant was made to look like the rainforest so they had a lot of fake leaves and trees all over, and on the walls of the restaurant were these 3D animals of which some came alive every 15 minutes, and every 30 minutes they had a "thunderstorm", with everything except for the rain. So that was a lot of fun. We also went to those picture booth thingys....anyway,&nbsp;we sent my&nbsp;disposable camera to the developers, and we&nbsp;should get the pictures soon...I hope they turned out well. I still have a lot of school work to do, so I'll go, but good luck on your exams Tiff! ~Sasha
