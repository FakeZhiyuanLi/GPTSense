						   I know of the peace that is so elequently described in the Bible, and so passionately described by many at the pulpit. I have learned that when I keep my heart open to REGULAR communication with Jesus, I am able to 'walk' with Him, hence, I can also 'hear' Him wispering to my heart. Futher I have learned that when I am not 'walking' with Him, I feel much like an infant that was removed from the warm blanket for some unknown reason. No wonder they cry...heh...Loss of warmth,security,and contentment. As I look back, there are some key things that I see. The first,and most frusterating is that when I feel distanced from Jesus, I have been the one to walk away. Literally gone astray. I wonder why I do that so often? I wonder why I do not recognine my 'walking' away until I feel the loss of my 'blanket'? I do still manage to read the Bible 2-3 times a week...but anyone who knows of these things that I speak of also knows that my lack of spending time in God's word is part of the reason that I tend to wander and then feel the distance.  I wonder why I get lazy doing what I seem to know is vital to having a personal, functioning relationship with Jesus? Even in the midst of trouble, and believe me...I have spent a conciderable amount of time there lately, when I spend time in a Bible study, reading directly from the Bible, or just talking with Jesus, I feel anew. Refreshed in hope. Fortified in faith through grace.  After a conversation with Jesus, my problems are still here, after finishing a Bible study, my problems are still here, after finishing a whole book in the Bible, my problems are still here, but I do not feel alone, I do not feel like the problems are unbareable, and Jesus always strengthens my faith in believing that He will continue to take care of me.  I wonder why I wait to consult with the Great Mentor... Sometimes I wonder...

						   I have a real neat mom. She lends free advice,bakes great cakes and cookies, does my laundry when I come home to visit, and she regularly sends me little things via Email, be it letters reminding me that she loves me,cute pics, or just something that she thinks I will appreciate. Yesterday in my Email I found one that was not only useful, but that will never become old news, or out of date. Here is a copy...  Directions To Our Father's House  Make a Right onto Believeth Blvd. Keep straight and go through the Green Light, which is Jesus Christ. There, you must turn onto the Bridge of Faith, which is over trubled water. When you get off the bridge, make a Right turn and keep straight. You are on King's Highway - Heaven-bound. Keep going for three miles: One for the father, One for the Son, and One for the Holy Ghost. Then exit off onto Grace Blvd.  From there, make a Right turn on Gospel Lane. Keep straight and then make another Right on Prayer Road. As you go on your way, Yeild Not to the traffic on Temptation Ave. Also, avoid SIN STREET because it is a DEAD END. Pass up Envy Drive, and Hate Avenue. Also, pass Hypocrisy Street, Gossiping Lane, and Backbiting Blvd. However, you have to go down Long-Suffering Lane, Persecution Blvd. and Trials and Tribulations Ave. But that's all right, because Victory Street is straight ahead AMEN!!!!!

         Have you ever been in a situation that makes you so mad that you see red and want nothing more than revenge.     How does one get past the feelings of getting even?     Well first as humans we have to drop the mind set that we are perfect, and that we make mistakes too. Still how does this really help us from not acting upon getting revenge?       Praying is maybe the only thing that I have found to really help. I have tried other methods,however; to no avail came  to realize that I still have to look in the mirror. What I see is not very nice and then I try and cover it up with new hair cut or color. Still, I realize it is still me in that mirror.         Someone once asked me "what is humility"I had a gamma of definitions for them.  I do believe that when you forgive and really mean it in your heart that is humility.          So the next time you feel so bad about being done wrong remember, try praying it will be by far the most effective way to feel better...
