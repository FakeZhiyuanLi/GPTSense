      Hey well hi I am so bored right now and I have nothing to do I can't even leave the house cause I have to watch my sisters puppy and stuff well she is sleeping now at least and I don't have to watch her every move. Which by the way gets really annoying after a while I know she is cute and everything but u know I have a life too. Friday night how pathetic am I just sitting at home and watching the dogs ugh life just sucks sometimes.    Omg when is this cold weather going to go away it is so annoying I just want to snap my fingers and make it go away but I cant and it sucks big time but you know what I cant do anything about it just deal...   anyways... Nothing really good or bad happened today just a normal day... In math we did algebra, in social studies we did a debate, in health we went to the library, in science.. ooo yeah that was pretty cool we did this experiment thingy and got copper to go onto these paper clips and we wore those science goggle thingies lmao, uhhh in English we watched a movie twice and still didn't see the ending and in study we got our report cards. Allie's last day was today and then she is going to Florida and she wont be back until next week sometime. School is not gonna be the same w/o her for a week lmao I don't know if it is a good thing or bad thing but we have madd fun! "that's it I'm done I'm going to my seat!" haha   well I'm all outta things to say so I'll write back later bye

Way to many to count lol! Omg its a miracle marissa remembered her purse lol   Any way in English class that was madd fun when we were supposed to be reading we all were passing notes and marissa was stupid enough to pass her money I can't believe tamrah gave it back to her lol.   In science it smelt soooooooooo bad like fish in there and we looked at the table and there was a note and it said Ryan I told you to keep your legs closed!! eewww --- turns out there was an octopus in the sink or what ever and I had to help clean up a sink I'll tell you rubbing alcohol and fish don't smell good at all I like gagged to death omg how could Ms marioenze deal with that smell all day!
