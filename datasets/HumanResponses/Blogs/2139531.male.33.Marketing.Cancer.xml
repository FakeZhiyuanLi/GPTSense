      well here's a new post,   This one is from Ben C. of Sterling MA.   ...." Had two girls eat each other 3 inches from my face..then I fell off the stage and took out a table and three chairs grabbed the microphone from the mc and started yelling Yankees suck! I then blacked out again.I came two when I thought I was pissing into some expensive indoor waterfall, but then realized it was a toilet. I Puked at PFK(which Canadianian for KFC) broke the bathroom door and poured an entire beer in nates lap in the middle of the restaurant. This was all in the span of  the first 3 hrs."    Clearly Chicka is gonna need to tell us more, a story like this is going to get worse before it got better...hmm    did Princess Diana predict her own death?  CNN is actually been pushing this story for a few hours now...  why?     tupac and biggie  actually  did predict their deaths  although a lifestyle case could be made for their preseince   but her?

       Crazed Monomania excerpt (Chapter 3)   "there he goes, one of God's own prototypes. A high-powered mutant of some kind, never even considered for mass production. Too weird to live, too rare to die."    I stopped thinking about writing and started writing.   It seemed like forever, similar to when you need to piss but you only are barely half-awake, five more minutes you tell yourself , ‘maybe if I go back to sleep this feeling will go away‘; and the 5 minutes go by and you are more and more uncomfortable and yet you don’t move. The feeling gets stronger and you start to feel that discomfort low in your gut, and you still don’t move. And now its four am and you are now wide awake and get up to go to the bathroom, and as you softly go down the stairs.    ”THUD”  Tragically, you hear the toilet lid drop, and see the bathroom light is on. Shit ! What the fuck am I gonna do now. And who the fuck has to take a shit at four in the morning.   The Trip has been in the Planning stage for a while now and nothing is happening.  The Friends that I am going to see have there own Fears and the last thing that they need to see right now is a couple of wild characters upsetting their Ideas of the American Dream. We all wanted to put the Summer or maybe the past behind us. They left Home to find their dreams and I stayed behind.

      Scene 1  Take 1  Interior Shot: Man sitting at keyboard in basement office, looking distracted   This is my first posting and I will add to it as possible or necessary  .   I have been rather upset about my beloved Red Sox losing to the Yankees in game 7   This is a excerpt from Bill Simmons Column from Page 2  "Twenty minutes after the Yankees eliminated the Sox, I called my father to make sure he was still alive.   And that's not even a joke. I wanted to make sure Dad wasn't dead. That's what it feels like to be a Red Sox fan. You make phone calls thinking to yourself, "Hopefully, my Dad picks up, because there's at least a 5-percent chance that the Red Sox just killed him."      It's safe to say that Jessica Simpson could have managed Game 7 better than Grady.  Well, he picked up. And we talked it through. We always do. Dad's voice was barely audible. He sounded like he just got out of surgery. Like every other Sox fan on the planet, he couldn't understand one simple question: Why didn't Grady take out Pedro? In the eighth inning, Pedro was running on fumes. Everyone knew it. Everyone but Grady Little.   Little did we know, our overmatched manager was saving his worst for last.   "He screwed up the season," Dad grumbled. "He screwed up the whole season."   So it happened again. Nothing was worse than Game Six against the Mets, but this was damned close. I don't need to tell you why. If the Red Sox were a girl, you would probably just break up with them. You would call them on the phone, explain to them calmly that you can't take it anymore, let them down as gently as possible, then move on with your life. But sports aren't like that. You're stuck with your teams from childhood. It's like being trapped in a bad marriage. You can't get out.   Hey, this is my team. I came to grips with that a long time ago. They're part of my life. Sometimes they lift me to a higher place. Sometimes they punch me in the stomach and leave me for dead. There's no rhyme or reason. And there are thousands and thousands of diehards just like me, all trapped in that same bad marriage, united by our experiences and memories. We wear Sox caps, we pack Fenway Park, we travel insane distances to support our team on the road. We always have each other. And some days are better than others.   This was one of the bad days. Given that the f**king Yankees were involved, and the way things unfolded, it may have tied for the worst.   I can't say this strongly enough: I will spend the rest of my life wondering why Grady let Pedro wilt to death in the eighth inning. This isn't Pantheon Pedro anymore; honestly, it's been over two years since he was doing his Mozart routine on the mound. Even if his best start is still better than just about anyone else's best start, asking him to throw 125-plus pitches over three-plus hours in Yankee Stadium -- in the most improbable, nerve-wracking setting imaginable -- was indefensible at best and catastrophically moronic at worst.   Unlike the other devastating losses over the years, you couldn't blame any of the Sox players for losing the series this time around (no, not even Nomar). This was a great group of guys -- a resilient, likable team that almost always came through, just like they proved in Game Six. Every time you counted them out, they came roaring back. I loved that about them. Unfortunately, they couldn't manage themselves. Switch Grady Little and Joe Torre and the Red Sox win the series. The two teams were that close.     What are these fans so mad about? Their team is going to the World Series.  I would rehash the eighth for you, but frankly, I'm not in the mood. Nobody in his right mind would have allowed Pedro -- 115 pitches on the odometer, struggling heroically with a three-run lead, running on the fumes of his fumes -- to pitch to Hideki Matsui. Not with flame-throwing Alan Embree waiting in the bullpen. This isn't even a debate. And the ensuing disaster -- Matsui's ground-rule double, followed by Posada's bloop single to tie the game -- wasn't just predictable, it was downright sickening. It was '86 all over again. Aaron Boone's homer in the 11th wasn't just inevitable, it was practically preordained.   Of course, the TV networks and newspapers got what they wanted: They spent the entire month gleefully rehashing those same "Curse" stories for both the Cubs and Sox, flashing graphics like "RED SOX WORLD SERIES WINS AFTER 1918: 0" and showing so many Babe Ruth pictures, you would have thought John Henry Williams had brought the Babe back to life. It was borderline pathological. Fox even made Boone's brother a guest announcer for the Sox-Yanks series -- apparently, Plan B was one of George Steinbrenner's kids. Well, here's your reward, guys: A Yankees-Marlins series that absolutely nobody will watch. Well done.   That two star-crossed franchises both blew three-run leads with five outs to go . . . sure, that's a little kooky. But the 2003 Cubs didn't lose because of a goat, and they didn't lose because of poor Steve Bartman. They lost because Dusty stupidly left Mark Prior in the game too long. They lost because their bullpen, shaky all season, imploded at the worst possible time. They lost because Gonzalez botched an easy ground ball, and because Kerry Wood didn't rise to the occasion in Game 7. That's why they lost.   It was a little more simple for the 2003 Red Sox. They fell short because of their crappy manager, to the surprise of absolutely no one who followed the team on a regular basis. I'm sure he's a nice man, and I'm sure everyone likes him . . . but when it comes right down to it, you don't want Grady Little managing your team in the "Biggest Non-World Series Game Of All-Time." I could give you about 150 Grady examples from the last two weeks -- including him breaking the major-league record for "Consecutive games with a failed hit-and-run that resulted in a double play" -- but that would be a waste of everyone's time. This man would hit on 19 at a blackjack table because "he had a feeling." That's all you need to know.   As for me, I feel like Andrew Golota just spent the last two weeks punching me in the gonads. The A's series sucked up 90 percent of the residual emotion in my body -- it was like enduring a four-hour breakup with somebody, then deciding to get back together in the end. The Debacle That Was Game Three -- Pedro acting like a baby and throwing at Garcia, Manny overreacting because Clemens threw a fastball within four feet of his head, Zimmer and Pedro re-enacting the Clubber-Mickey fight in "Rocky 3" -- took care of the rest of my emotions. For the past few days, I was walking around with one of those weird, Daryl Hannah-like half-smiles on my face, like the lights were on and nobody was home. I was tapped.   Like I wrote last week, the baseball playoffs can do that to you. My friend JackO (a Yankee fan) called me on Thursday to say, "No matter what happens, I'm a carcass right now." That's the perfect word. Carcass. Of course, he doesn't feel that way anymore, the bastard. His team came through. Mine failed. Again. You know it's a bad loss when one of your friends is saying, "I just spent the last 15 minutes reflecting on everything that's good about my life, and I guess I just have to keep doing that for the next couple of days to get through this" (actual quote from my buddy Hench).     Welcome to another year in Red Sox Nation.  And I'm sure this game will be a staple on ESPN Classic, and that it will definitely cost Grady Little his job -- thank God -- but honestly, the last two weeks took something out of me. You spend six months following a team, you devote something like 1,000 hours of your year to watching-reading-discussing them, and then everything vanishes in thin air. And you feel like a moron for devoting so much of your time to something so, so, so . . . (I can't even think of the right word).   Only one thing still bothers me. As a Sox fan, I take great pride in ignoring the past, thinking positively and blindly believing that "This is the year" under any and all circumstances. I don't believe in the Curse. At least, I think I don't. With that said, I watched the first 10 innings at my office last night, surrounded by a support system of friends from work. When the clock turned midnight on the East Coast, I noticed the "NY 5, Boston 5" score . . .    And I started thinking about it . . .    (Haven't I been down this road before?) . . .    And I finally made the connection.   (Oh God!)   And it weakened my knees like Kerry Wood's curveball.   It was like seeing the Ghost of Eighty-Six. Suddenly, I knew they were going to lose. I grabbed my stuff and quickly bolted out of there, looking like a guy grabbing his clothes after a bad one-night stand. My friends were in disbelief -- it was like Montecore the Tiger was dragging me off the stage. I couldn't possibly explain it to them. Ten minutes later, I walked through my front door, sat down next to the Sports Gal -- who was dutifully watching the entire game on the sofa -- then watched Aaron Boone crush that Wakefield knuckler into the stands.   I had been home for about 45 seconds. No lie.   Looking back, I can't say I was surprised . . . just like Cubs fans can't say they were surprised when the wheels came off after Gonzalez's error. As a sports fan, sometimes you know when bad things are about to happen. You recognize the depressing signs because you've been there before. So maybe that's the real "curse," those moments when you turn into Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense . . . only you aren't seeing dead people, you're seeing a dead ballgame. And when it's happening to thousands of fans all at once, the resulting collective karma kills your team.     It was not if but when the Yankee hero would be crowned.  (Does any of this make sense? Of course not. I'm completely insane. The Red Sox have driven me insane. It's official.)   Anyway, my wife understands now. She only jumped on the bandwagon a few years ago, thanks to me. Now her Sox virginity has been taken; she was near tears last night. "I finally understand why you're so crazy about this team," she kept saying. "I can't imagine going through this for my entire life. This is horrible." Add another one to the list.   As for my Dad, he's still alive. When we were hanging up last night -- right after we finished rehashing Grady Little's mistakes -- I mentioned how I had to stay up late to write a column.   "You have to write something tonight?" my father said, incredulous. "Damn. I'm going to bed."   "You can go to sleep right now?" I asked.   "Of course not. I'm just too depressed to do anything else."   That's my Dad. He's 55 years old. I hope he gets to see the Red Sox win a World Series some day.   I hope.

      And the Award for the Most Potent Pot Goes To...     LISBON (Reuters) - Cannabis in the Netherlands is almost twice as strong as in the rest of the European Union (news - web sites), where the drug's potency has remained stable, the EU drugs agency said on Friday.          Politicians' worries over the health risks of stronger cannabis prompted the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction to examine marijuana and hashish available in the bloc.   "Today's report shows that effective potency of cannabis in nearly all EU countries has remained quite stable for many years," the center said.   The potency of cannabis in most EU countries has remained at about six to eight percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient.   The only exception was in the Netherlands, where potency had reached 16 percent by 2001-02, mostly because of supplies of intensively produced home-grown cannabis.   However, this did not affect the EU average since most cannabis consumed there was produced outside the bloc.         Benjamin Cheslawski III

       urlLink USATODAY.com - What to wear and what not wear at the airport     From our good friends at the USA Today, a guide of what to wear, and not to wear at the airport....  " Travel and security experts also point out that, in case of an on-board emergency that requires evacuating the airplane, sneakers or low-heeled shoes with good traction are going to be more useful than sandals, high heels or dress shoes with slippery soles. "  So in the event of a CRASH or other reason to CLIMB over the WING of the plane, Sneakers are the way to go...  What else?  "You'll want to wear loose comfortable clothing," says Jong, because "gastro-intestinal gas expands at altitude." She suggests wearing natural fibers, including cotton, linen or wool because these fabrics "breathe" in humid conditions.  YUCK  And in case of an emergency, they are less flammable than synthetic fibers. Jong and others make a special point of urging women not to wear pantyhose on airplanes because in a fire the fibers will melt and stick to your skin."    Hmm  ...In Case of Emergency they are less flammable   is small relief when the plane smacks the runway at 400mph....  ... "...point of urging women not to wear pantyhose on airplanes because in a fire the fibers will melt and stick to your skin"   ...well enjoy your trip

        "Do you want to get some chili", Don't ask me what I was thinking last night when Jessica and I left the Roobar in Hyannis last nite.   I feel like shit right now, its hot and I have a bunch of shit that I should be doing right now that I am not.  These things include  Returning and Following up phone calls Working on the B Party Project Mowing the lawn at some point Returning Jess' Car Keys (dont ask) and  Doing Laundry  Obviously I am not working today, I drank too much last nite.  1 glass of Red Wine (Gato Negro...that should have been a sign right there) an amstel light  a few bud lights on the way to Hyannis W Jessica....she insisted on driving, claims that she didnt want to get kidnapped by any of my late nite debauchery, and yet somehow I ended up driving her Altima home, and it was a very nice ride too...never really liked the old Altimas, but the new ones ride very well, have good power and the stereo kicks ass.  Our first stop was one of my Top Ten Dives (Cape Cod Division)...the Quarterdeck in Hyannis...  I would describe this place as "every dive you've ever been into" but with nicer people and remarkably cheap drinks.  I show up there about once a month for the Pint Glass of Bourbon and Coke...  Its a weird crowd, the last twenty people you'd ever put into a room together.  A Harley dude or two, a few Dead-End Alcoholics (*now with gin blossoms!*), and well you know the rest....  back to the hangover  after a few drinks and marlboro lites we went to the ROO-Bar...and its safe to say that I am the only person to regularly go to both places...  we have a few shots, more drinks and run into a good number of people we both knew for a tuesday nite...  all of whom have to work w a hangover today. I can't write right now, all the blood is gone from my head.

       Chiquita trying to invent better, flavored bananas   CINCINNATI (AP) — Bananas flavored with the hint of another fruit could help Chiquita International Brands Inc. become the Starbucks of the produce world, the company's leader says, envisioning a larger, creamier or sweeter banana.  Chiquita has taken its bananas to the research lab as part of an effort to make the fruit more appealing to consumers — and to persuade them to pay more, president and CEO Fernando Aguirre told The Associated Press in an interview.   For competitive reasons, the company would not specify flavors it is researching and declined to reveal how different sorts of bananas would be created other than to say the fruit would not be genetically modified.   "I have seen about eight and tasted four or five different types," Aguirre said of the flavored bananas. "Now we need to find out from consumers if this is relevant and whether it is something they would like to see and be willing to pay for."   The company hopes to test some of its new products in the United States or Europe within a year, Aguirre said in the interview Friday.

      July 1st, 2004 11:59 pm A British General's View of Fahrenheit 9/11    DAILY MAIL (London) / July 1, 2004 General Sir Michael Rose, Former Commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia  I suspect many soldiers serving in Iraq today will find Michael Moore's film intensely irritating.  This is because for much of the film he allows his antiwar, anti-Bush and anti-big business stance to obscure the important debate: whether President George W. Bush led his country - and by default the UK - into war in Iraq on a lie and whether subsequently, in trying to impose justice, freedom and democracy on the Iraqi people by force, the Americans became so violent and brutal themselves that they lost the moral high ground for ever.   Nevertheless, Moore has mounted a powerful protest against the Bush administration, in which he uses all the tricks of the skilled polemicist - ridicule, conspiracy theory and sensationalism.  He shows terrible images of dead and dying civilians and soldiers in Iraq.  He interviews U.S. soldiers both in Iraq and in hospital in America who question why they went to Iraq 'to kill innocent civilians', and he intrudes closely on the grief of an American mother who lost her son.  I believe that this film will utterly destroy any residual confidence that the American people might have in the credentials of George W. Bush as a decisive war leader.  For a full five minutes, Moore cruelly dwells on Bush's vacuous, tortured face in close-up immediately after he had been told about the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon.  The message is clear. Here is no Roosevelt, Churchill or Thatcher, but a deeply inadequate man whose mind is frozen with indecision and fear. It is a look I know well - if he had been a subordinate commander in battle I would have immediately relieved him of his command.  What emerges from this film is that America is unlikely ever to attempt such a disastrous military adventure again.  The trust of many of the American people in their leadership is destroyed and the all-volunteer Army in Iraq has run out of steam. It is now heavily dependent on the reservists who are taking much of the strain of operations in Iraq.  Many of these young people only joined the army to obtain funding for their university education. They never expected to be sent overseas for such a prolonged period of time, and - if Moore's film is a true reflection of American opinion - they will not allow themselves to be so badly misled again.  Looking beyond Moore's sensationalism, I think that his underlying message is nonetheless valid.  The war in Iraq was immoral and it has caused some Americans to behave in an immoral way themselves. Meanwhile, the wider war on terror is being lost.  Fact or fiction, everyone should see this film. I, for one, support Moore's protest.

       urlLink ESPN.com: Page2     Smoking a Blount    courtesy of  By Bill Simmons Page 2  Posted 2:30 p.m., ET, July 9    You remember the famous diner scene in "Heat." Of course you do. Best scene in the movie. When it suddenly came together midway through the film, I remember everyone in the theater holding their breath -- it was like seeing Magic and Larry playing on the Dream Team, only if both of them were healthy. These things just don't happen.    That scene was filmed in Beverly Hills at a fancy diner called Kate Mandolini's, which proudly displays a picture of DeNiro and Pacino sitting at the table between takes. I inadvertently went there for dinner about a year ago. Upon discovering where I was eating, it was 20 times more exciting then being in the Sistine Chapel. I'm not sure what that says about me.     You can't say Blount doesn't play hard -- even against the Wizards.  Anyway, there's a reason I'm telling you this. During that scene, when Pacino tells DeNiro that he seems like a nice guy but he's taking him down if they cross paths again, DeNiro gives him the old, "There's a flip side to that coin" routine, then wonders, "What if I gotta take you down?" I always liked that phrase. There's a flip side to that coin. So when I realized that I needed to write about the Celtics in today's column, and that at least 95 percent of the readers would be disappointed about it, I realized that I had to pull out the DeNiro speech.    On the bright side, you're getting more columns from me. But folks, there's a flip side to that coin: You have to endure occasional Celtics rants. It's like a tax for the new Sports Guy's World page. I know more about the Celtics and the NBA than I know about anything else. So maybe that's my challenge -- I'm going to make you care. Every few weeks, I'm going to write about them. That's just the way it's going to be. If you skip it, no hard feelings.   Anyway, the Celtics re-signed Mark Blount to a $40 million, six-year extension yesterday. I knew it was coming. When one potential stiff (Mehmet Okur) went for $50 million and one proven stiff (Adonal Foyle) went for $41 million, Blount's market was pretty much set. He's better than both of those guys, which doesn't mean much. Two winters ago, the Celtics gave him away to Denver, then reacquired him for Shammond Williams a few months later. Straight-up.    (Yes, the Shammond Williams who went to UNC. The guy who's been on 25 different teams. The guy who Chris Wallace once said was "the key" to the Vin Baker trade, which was ironic because Baker was making $13 million a year. I miss Chris Wallace. He could have sold dog poop on two slices of french bread for $15 a sandwich. But that's a whole other story.)    When you're being swapped straight-up for a journeyman point guard, and you're a seven-footer . . . I mean, that's not a good sign. But that's where he was. Blount always worked hard -- he could block shots, he wasn't a bad rebounder, and he had the worst hands known to mankind. He was one of the few Celtic players in the last 25 years who actually made my Dad grunt out loud. Dad can't stand centers with bad hands. It's his all-time pet peeve. We never imagined that Blount would be anything more than a backup, like a more-athletic Greg Kite.   Then something weird happened. Something REALLY weird.   When the team fell apart after the Antoine/Eric Williams trades, once it became apparent that Danny Ainge was trying to tank the season -- which proved impossible because the Eastern Conference was so brutal, something Ainge should have known at the time -- Blount inexplicably turned into a poor man's Robert Parish. As a writer, I use the word "inexplicable" too much. I just like the way it sounds. Many times, it's even the right word for whatever point I'm trying to make. In this particular case, you can't come up with a better word for what happened to Mark Blount over the last 50 games of the 2003-2004 season. This was inexplicable. There was no answer.   Suddenly, Blount was controlling the boards and grabbing rebounds in traffic. When they ran plays for him -- which wasn't often because Ricky Davis and Paul Pierce didn't even realize he was on their team until April -- Blount was consistently making 10-foot turnarounds and those Duncan jump-hooks. He showed a knack for busting his butt downcourt off opposing misses, beating his guy and even occasionally catching passes for lay-ups. And it wasn't like he was trying harder or something -- he always tried hard. Things just fell into place for him. I can't explain it. Really, I can't explain it. It was like watching Brooke Burns turn into an Emmy Award-winning actress overnight.    In January and February, Blount played 28 games and averaged 11 points and eight rebounds. In March and April, he played 21 games and averaged 14 points and nearly 11 rebounds -- that's a legitimate double-double for nine straight weeks. Against teams without true centers, he dominated certain games -- like the improbable 28-21 he slapped on Orlando in March. Even against studs like Jermaine O'Neal and Ben Wallace, he was holding his own. In the playoffs against Indiana, he was the only guy on the team who seemed like he actually cared whether they won or lost.   There were two possibilities here: Either he is the proverbial late bloomer, or he was pulling a McIllvane, this year's stiff center making a contract run at the perfect time. There's one every year. The names read like a morgue report: the immortal Jim McIllvane (who started everything) ... Ike Austin ... Cal Booth ... Jerome James ... John Amaeche ... Shawn Bradley ... Chris Dudley ... Greg Ostertag. Some guys can even crap the bed and still get paid -- like Vitaly Potapenko or Michael Olowokandi. If you're big, and you're available, someone always wants you. Always. Even if it seems like you're wearing mittens.   So that was the dilemma. Late bloomer or McIllvane? Once the Foyle-Okur contracts were inflicted on the general public, Dad and I were resigned to the fact that Blount was leaving and we wouldn't have a center next season. I mean, after the Baker and LaFrentz debacles, surely this team had learned its lesson, right? You should only open your checkbooks for a sure thing. Right?    We learned this ... I mean, we LEARNED this. Right?     Blount's hands have the makings of another free agent legend.  Word came down yesterday morning: Blount was in the fold. Six years, $41 million, with a 15-percent bump if they ever tried to trade him. Staggering numbers for a 28-year-old center who played well for exactly three and a half months in his entire career, a span that directly coincided with his imminent status as a free agent. This made three straight summers that the team rolled the dice on a big man with question marks. One of them had a drinking problem and a poisonous contract. One of them had knee problems and a poisonous contract. And one of them was Mark Blount, the leading contender for the 2004 Jim McIllvane Award. Now the Celtics have no salary cap flexibility whatsoever for at least the next three years. Beautiful.   I spent yesterday morning banging my head against the desk. We were going to suck again. Bird retired 12 years ago; it's been a comedy of errors ever since. VH1 could actually produce a "Top 25 Celtics Mistakes Of The Last 12 Years" show. I'm not kidding. You could come up with 25. In fact, I just may write that column some day.    Anyway, I sulked for about four hours. Then I started thinking about it rationally. This wasn't a terrible contract -- it was actually under market value for a starting center. A number of teams wooed Blount this summer who know what they're doing, including Indiana and Miami. Plus, we didn't have a center next season. And I watched all those games last year; Blount wasn't like Erick Dampier, a guy who didn't give a crap for four years, then suddenly got himself into shape and started playing hard because he was in a contract year. Blount always played hard. That was his best quality.   More importantly, the biggest misnomer about the NBA is cap space. Everyone craves it. Gotta have that cap space. So what happens when they actually have cap space? Dumb things happen. Mehmet Okur gets $50 million. Steve Nash gets $60 million-plus when his back could go out at any time. Rafer Alston gets $29 million even though he's never proven to be anything more than a change-of-pace point guard. And this isn't a recent thing. Remember the Shandon Anderson and Howard Eisley contracts? The Luc Longley deal? The Derek Anderson signing? Thirty-three million for Vitaly Freaking Potapenko????    Here's my point: When you're already paying LaFrentz and Pierce a combined $75-80 million over the next three years, cap space isn't really any option, anyway. And even if it was an option, given the recent history of the team, it's almost a mortal lock that they would screw up and sign the wrong guy. So what's the big deal about overpaying someone like Blount, rather than losing someone who had evolved into a possible asset? Why let someone leave for nothing? Why not roll the dice? You already have LaFrentz making something like 22 percent of your cap . . . what's the difference at this point?   Anyway, at 1:45 p.m. West Coast time, on July 8, 2004, I officially talked myself into the Mark Blount signing. The Eastern Conference couldn't be worse. It's not possible. You could see a 28-win team make the playoffs next year. With Boozer stabbing Cleveland in the back, with K-Mart potentially fleeing the Meadowlands, with all kinds of crazy rumors about Iverson floating around right now, you could see a conference with two very good teams (Detroit and Indiana), two good teams (Miami and Milwaukee), two decent teams (New York and New Jersey), two questions marks who could go either way (Philly and Cleveland), and then lottery teams galore.    (Note: Now we're getting into the "Ifs" portion of the column.)   If Blount keeps putting up those double-doubles . . .    If Pierce starts playing like a blue-chipper again . . .    If LaFrentz's knees are healthy . . .    If they lucked out with Delonte West like everyone says (including me) . . .    If Marcus Banks matures this season (which seems highly probable) . . .    If they can move Chucky Atkins and/or Ricky Davis for a low-post player (Juwan Howard???) . . .    If they can clear some playing time for Jiri Welsch and Tony Allen (who's already won over the entire coaching staff and is already being compared to Ron Artest) . . .    If they can sign a veteran power forward like Antonio McDyess or Marcus Fizer for short money to grab some rebounds and tutor Al Jefferson . . .   I mean, that's not a bad team . . . especially with Doc Rivers coaching it. That's a 6th or 7th seed in the decrepit East. Maybe even better if some of the other teams suffer some bad luck with injuries.    (One potential landmine: Although it seems like Ainge actually knows talent, given his superb draft picks last month, he still suffers from a bad case of Pitino-itis. In other words, he can't stop tinkering. Even now, as he claims that the team isn't shopping Pierce, it's impossible to forget that he made those same promises about Antoine Walker last summer. He's one of those over-competitive dreamers who fervently believes that he's one phone call away from turning the entire franchise around. Pitino was the same way. That's why Ainge makes me nervous as hell. He's like one of those loose-cannon friends that everyone has, the guy you're afraid to get drunk with, the guy who ropes you into a mammoth bar brawl because somebody accidentally bumped his pool cue. You never feel totally safe with him.)   And then there's this: We have no evidence that free agents actually want to play in Boston. They want to play in Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, New York . . . they want to live in big cities or warm places. They don't want to deal with scraping ice off their windshield, or being heckled by Murph and Sully at the tail end of a 113-78 blowout. For instance, last summer the Celtics could have moved Antoine for Rasheed Wallace. That's a great trade. Unfortunately, even though Rasheed had no contractual rights whatsover to block the deal, he wanted no part of Boston. His agent even told the team something along the lines of "If this deal goes down, Rasheed is going to make everyone's life VERY difficult."    When Rasheed Wallace's agent tells you that, you listen. They didn't make the trade.     Needless to say, the Sports Guy's dad doesn't share Walter McCarty's sentiment.  The bottom line is that the Celtics haven't lured a marquee free agent to Boston in 10 years, not since ML Carr signed Dominique Wilkins and the salad fork in his back to a multi-year contract. And sure, some of that has to do with a perpetual lack of cap space, as well as a "Consecutive Moron Streak" of guys running the team. But this isn't the old days. NBA players in the 21st century don't give a crap about those 16 banners, or the fact that Russell, Bird and Havlicek used to play there. To them, Boston is just another city, and it's not near anything, and it's only warm for four months a year. Some even mistakenly believe that Boston is a racist city, as Barry Bonds's idiotic comments proved last month.   And that, my friends, is why we needed to sign Mark Blount for $41 million dollars. He wanted to stay in Boston. He's an overachiever. You roll the dice with people like that. Even if there's a 40-percent chance they might win the Jim McIllvane Award.   Anyway, when I called my father last night and explained my change of heart, he listened patiently and waited until I had finished. There were three seconds of silence.    And then . . .    "It's Mark Blount!" he finally screamed. "He's got bad hands! He'll always have bad hands!"   But Dad, we didn't have a cent-.   "Stop! It's Mark Blount! They just paid $41 million for Mark Blount!"    All right . . . maybe some people still need to be convinced.   Bill Simmons is a columnist for ESPN The Magazine and Page 2.

       A few random thoughts today....  Mike Ditka is considering a run for the Senate in Ill.  What?!!,  The last I remembered, he SANK the resurgent Saints with the Monster Ricky Williams debacle.. for those who dont remember, he gave up their entire draft to get Ricky Williams- who almost immediately came into some mental problems, an arrest or two, a Wedding Dress and eventually went on to Fame and Fortune with the Dolphins (but don't worry the Dolphins can't win after Thanksgiving)    ...Jimmy Buffett has a new album called "license to chill"...REALLY!...  Jimmy Buffett, License to Chill (* * * ) Hearing Buffett's impact on contemporary country music isn't hard: Just listen to any of Kenny Chesney's records and half of Alan Jackson's. Country's influence on Buffett is obvious in his covers of tunes by Hank Williams and Guy Clark. Chesney and Jackson join him for duets, as do George Strait, Toby Keith, Clint Black, Martina McBride and Nanci Griffith. Buffett also uses this platform to showcase the under-appreciated talents of slide guitarist Sonny Landreth, guitarist/songwriter Will Kimbrough and R&B singer Bill Withers. And none of the guests detracts from a Buffett experience; if anything, they bring a little more to the party. —Brian Mansfield  >  ...I wonder who this guy is? The USA Today really needs to get their shit together

       urlLink  USATODAY.com - The Roots tap urgent beat in 'Tipping Point' Four out of Four Stars!    Change is constant with The Roots, and The Tipping Point (* * * * out of four) once again finds the adventurous hip-hop band moving in a different direction.     The follow-up to their Grammy-winning Phrenology is sonically edgy and intense, much like their dynamic concerts.   Phrenology brought widespread recognition to the longtime critical favorite, and now that Outkast has kicked open the door for mold-breaking hip-hop acts, perhaps The Roots' seventh effort, out today, finally will give them a foothold in the pop mainstream.  The Tipping Point refers to Malcolm Gladwell's book about critical moments that touch off social phenomena, and the album certainly conveys a sense of urgency.  Between the riveting beats and frontman Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter's razor-sharp lyrics about a range of social ills, it's almost impossible to turn away. The Roots welcome back original keyboardist and now A-list producer Scott Storch, who contributes two tracks — the aggressive Duck Down and hard-driving first single Don't Say Nothing.  Other tracks are the result of jam sessions in Philadelphia late last year and early this year when core members — drummer Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson, keyboardist Kamal Gray and bassist Leonard "Hub" Hubbard — hooked up with an array of up-and-coming and established talents.   The ominous Somebody's Got to Do It is spiced by guest rhymers Devin the Dude and Jean Grae, while rapper Skillz joins ODB and comedian David Chappelle on the rambunctious The Mic. Boom pays homage to old-school hip-hop stars Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane with Black Thought's dead-on imitations of both.  The band also gives a nod to Sly and the Family Stone on mesmerizing opener Star and to Booker T. & the MG's on the pulsating finale, Melting Pot. In between, Black Thought unleashes political commentaries on Guns Are Drawn and Why?  Phrenology was more ambitious and experimental, but The Tipping Point's stripped-down simplicity gives its music and messages a raw energy. That's typical of The Roots. Repetition has never been in their expansive vocabulary.   Too bad more hip-hop acts don't see that as an antidote to mediocrity.

      TULSA, OK—University of Tulsa sophomore Ben Stoll was gracious enough to sleep with third-year law student Rosie Andriessen Monday. "Rosie had been acting insecure and needy all evening, so I figured I'd help her out a bit," said Stoll, who met Andriessen last year through common friends. "She probably thinks she's too chubby. It must be a big boost for her to have sex with a guy like me." Stoll decided not to call Andriessen the next day, nor to return any calls she might make, so as not to get her hopes up.

       A new firm called MetroNaps has opened on the 24th floor of New York's Empire State Building. The company offers 20-minute power naps in sleeping pods for $14 a pop. It reminds me of my first career in what seems like another lifetime ago, as an investment banker at a Wall Street firm. I was one of those grunts who worked 100-hour weeks. We actually had a nurse's office in the basement with nap rooms, which eventually became my crutch. After an all-nighter (or two), I would repair to the nap rooms during the afternoons. I instructed my secretary to transfer any vital calls downstairs, whereupon a nurse would wake me up with the phone. One time, I was awakened by a call from a partner in our San Francisco office. He said he was perplexed by the news that I was in the nurse's office. He expressed hope that I wasn't sick, but was merely trying to catch some zzz's because I had been up all night working. Yes, I assured him, it was the latter, so no problem. (Like it would have mattered anyway.) Thus relieved of guilt, he gave me some more work to do. Later I wondered whether an industry in which it was considered perfectly fine to work three straight days without spending any time in my own bed was really the one for me.

           Q: Was the Vito Spatafore/Security Guard incident on the Sopranos the most unlikely "switching of teams" in television history? I actually heard people in my apartment building scream when his head popped up. I would have been less surprised if I found out Gary Payton was gay. Can Vito even go out in public anymore? And where do you apply for the job where you sit on a lawn chair all day at a construction site with five of your best friends?-- Tim Parliman, Hoboken, NJ   JIMMY KIMMEL: I still wake up screaming as a result of that scene. It's the sort of thing that challenges everything you believed up until that moment in your life. Are my parents actually my parents? Does God truly watch over us? Was it really necessary to shower with my Dad? Though fictional, it damaged my Gaydar permanently and may have bruised the inside of my brain. With that said, the fact that they dropped that story line completely is, in my mind, the most unforgivable sin in Sopranos history.   BILL SIMMONS: I was one of the people screaming when the head popped up. That was one of the all-time, "Noooooooooooooo!" moments. Now I'm more concerned about the actor who plays Vito -- within like 48 hours, he was pulling an Eric McCormack and giving the "You know, I'm not gay in real life" interviews. Just wait until he's getting heckled at an italian restaurant some night by some goomba who's re-enacting the "Now go get your shinebox" scene from "Goodfellas," only with some of Those Jokes thrown in. This is going to end badly.

      July 12, 2004 -- R. KELLY is so obsessed with Africa, he turned his music studio into a jungle. "I have never been to Africa, but I got books and studied up on the music, the culture and, most importantly, the people," Kelly told the upcoming issue of Damon Dash's America Magazine. "That's why you see all of the shrubs and plants and trees in here. I just wanted to feel it. I put tents in the studio and slept in the tents for like a few months, eating off the floors, dressed in army fatigues. . . . I know people out there might laugh, but we are in the jungle." In an apparent — and unfathomable — Vietnam reference, he continues, "We're on a serious mission, and just know that Charlie is out there to stop us, and you have to load up your guns. I know this all sounds crazy . . ."  It sure does.

      HOT DOG SHOWDOWN ON CAPITOL HILL: VEGAN PLAYMATES VS. RETIRED BALL PLAYERS      Playboy Playmates in Lettuce Bikinis Protest National Hot Dog Month    For Immediate Release: July 20, 2004  Contact: Matt Prescott 757-622-7382  Washington — In PETA’s corner, wearing nothing but lettuce bikinis, we have a pair of vegetarian Playboy Playmates who volunteered to hand out veggie dogs to promote the health benefits of a meatless diet. In the other corner, we have a portly pair of former baseball players, one of whom was previously hospitalized with heart problems, both paid by the American Meat Institute (AMI) to publicize "National Hot Dog" month with a greasy giveaway on Capitol Hill.   Let the food fight begin!   Date: Wednesday, July 21 Time: 11:30 a.m.-1 p.m. Place: Rayburn House Office Building, Independence Avenue entrance  "With obesity now recognized as a full-fledged epidemic, people who love food but also want to have fun and be fit can only opt for the healthier PETA lunch," says Lauren Anderson, Playboy’s July 2002 Playmate, who is volunteering her time, along with fellow Playmate and actor Kari Kennell. "If common sense doesn’t lure them, maybe the lettuce bikinis will," adds Kennell.    Among those paid by the AMI to promote the National Hot Dog month lunch are former Baltimore Oriole Davey Johnson, who was previously hospitalized with heart trouble, and former Chicago Cub Ferguson Jenkins, who was charged with cocaine and marijuana possession in Canada.   PETA has invited all members of Congress to sample Yves brand Jumbo Veggie Dogs while the AMI serves its annual snouts-and-spleens wiener lunch across the way. "Real-meat hot dogs contain all sorts of nasty ingredients, including the stomachs, snouts, tongues, intestines, and even hearts and anuses of animals abused and beaten on factory farms and in slaughterhouses," warns PETA Director of Vegan Campaigns Bruce Friedrich

      The Party,      well , everything started out great, we drank a case on the ride up....met the party at the Border Cafe for Margaritas and Patron shots around 430...drank for a few hours and went to the boat....  once we boarded the ship,   well.....heres where the story gets interesting  We drank for a half hour and watched the sox BATTLE the yanks and that was cool, feeling a nice buzz....  at about 7 or so there was an announcement that the dining room was opening and dinner was going to be served, so we finished our drinks and butts and went for dinner.  they really put on a nice spread, There was a Carving Station with some nice Roast Beef and I think there may have been turkey or some other meats, but I had some really nice beef... I also had some pasta, chicken picatta, swordfish and maybe some potatos....  So as were eating at our table, the waitress asks us if we want another drink....now I usually dont drink booze during dinner so I passed, and she then asks if we had taken our pills....  "What pills ?"  "...Motion sickness pills!"  "I dont get sea-sick" I replied....  ..."Is there something we should know?" I joked....she told us,   " I heard up-stairs it could get bumpy"  ...fast forward 20 mins....I took two pills and was sitting quietly sweating....  "you dont look so good", Wayne Rose says to me.  " I am ok", I reply, not really meaning it...."I just need some fresh air and a butt"  so we return to the promenade deck ( on top ) and go out for a butt....  as soon as the butt was lit,   everyone started getting sick....The seas were rough, some say 20 or 30 feet, and the 600ft motor vessel was tossed up and down like paris hilton on that video tape...  I was the first to vomit, i could barely walk and stumbled to the bathroom, without looking, I wondered into the ladies room.  Luckily unoccupied,   and proceeded to Vomit everywhere, the sink, the walls, floor, the toilet the toilet paper rolls, the "sanitized for your protection" toilet seat wrappers, the trash can....everywhere!  it looked like someone killed a cow in there, as there was a ton of shit everywhere!  because the ship was rolling everywhere, the vomit hit places you wouldnt think it could hit.  well, that took about 20 mins and when I left the ladies room, sideways, a guy was holding his hand over his mouth, and followed me in, and proceeded to do the same thing!   It seems that we sailed into a Atlantic storm, not really bad, but there were high seas and so many people got sick, one of my group stated that   " the dining room looked like a sick bay, all of the chairs were pushed togehter (200+), and people were passed out between the slot machines..."  the seas got so bad, they turned around early....which almost never happens....  but the MVP of the trip had to have been the guy who cleans the bathrooms, he cleaned puke for almost 6 hours straight, all the bathrooms were painted in roast beef and swordfish, and cheesecake ( which was fabulous )  at some point, i passed out for an hour or so, with the band playing 10 feet away from me, for an hour or so...  well, it was a night mare, although, not everyone got sick,  some in our group had eaten P-brownies and they didnt get sick at all....  so we are going to try again this weekend, not the cruise, just take Derrick out and get him shitty, and get some lap-dances    R

      Beantown Gossip Roundup:  In a brilliant attempt to capture the coveted 12-14 year old voter block, the hip folks at Rock the Vote and the Recording Industry Association of America threw an “exclusive” party at Avalon, headlined by the Black Eyed Peas. Emphasis on the quotation marks around “exclusive." Just like a New York bash, minus the good looking people, conspicuous coke consumption, and vomiting in the bathroom. Save for choice lines like “A Bush don’t really belong in a House/A Bush don’t even belong on a couch,” the BEPs were surprisingly not terrible. Farnsworth Bentley must be the new black or something (literally), cause both he and his umbrella showed. Highlight of the night, though, was definitely DNC Chairman Terry McAuliffe’s super awkward speech at the end, when he anointed the Black Eyed Peas the “world’s greatest band” and told the confused crowd how his wife had “discovered” them six months ago. He also proclaimed his intention to “kick George Bush’s ass back to Texas,” though he made the same promise 4 years ago, so take it for what it’s worth.  GQ threw a party honoring San Fran mayor and gay wedder Gavin Newsom at The Federalist in the Beacon Hotel as well. Anderson Cooper (a Gawker insider says he “looked totally awesome and hot in a grey suit”), John Cusack, Ben Affleck, and various offspring of Al Gore, John Edwards, and Nancy Pellosi were in attendance. Finally, the Boston Aquarium played host to Louisiana Senator John Breaux’s reggae/Cajun soiree, featuring Ziggy Marley. Way too insider-y for me. Go ask Wonkette -- or maybe she'll spill the dirt when she shows her face near Anderson Cooper's man-business on CNN tonight

         Teen injured at Neverland Ranch! SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) — A 15-year-old riding an all-terrain vehicle at Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch was hospitalized after the vehicle reportedly flipped  A security guard at the ranch directed paramedics to the victim, who was at the main house, county officials told the Santa Barbara News-Press.  The boy was lifted out of the ranch, about 35 miles northwest of Santa Barbara, by a helicopter and taken by ambulance to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital.

      An emailer told me yesterday  that  she smuggled 20 friends into a Democratic convention in the 80s by shuttling back and forth to the outside using only 2 press passes. My first thought (having now experienced Boston's post-9/11 security) was: Those were the days! ...Then I realized that her trick is still possible. The security checks at the Fleet Center are focused almost entirely on checking for weapons, not checking the identity of pass-holders. My i.d. hasn't been checked once, and my pass isn't linked to any specific person. That means someone--perhaps a bad someone--could in theory cadge two low-level "perimeter" press passes and smuggle dozens of compatriots into the convention hall. ...

       Semen from another man found in the underpants and on the body of Kobe Bryant's accuser convinced a defense expert and a law-enforcement analyst that the woman must have had sex shortly after her encounter with the basketball star, according to transcripts from closed- door hearings released late Monday. The transcripts include testimony from Dr. Elizabeth Johnson, a defense forensics expert, in which she concludes that the accuser had sex with an unknown "Mr. X" in the hours immediately after reportedly enduring a sexual assault. "It is likely that there was not any sperm from Mr. X inside (the accuser) at the time Mr. Bryant had his encounter with her, and that sexual contact ... likely occurred after (the accuser) and Mr. Bryant were together," she said. Her depiction of the time frame is based on the assertion that semen from Mr. X was found in the woman's underpants, on her legs and inside her vagina - along with that from Bryant - but Bryant had no traces of Mr. X on him.   I don't see how Kobe could possibly lose this case.

       From the California 11th Circuit of Appeals...courtesy of  Wonkette   urlLink  Read the Decision    To persuade underage females to prostitute for them, the Defendants (and other pimps charged in the indictment) presented a vision of ostentatious living, promising fame and fortune. Pimps perpetrated this myth with their own flamboyant dress, flashy jewelry, and exotic, expensive cars. To support this apparently extravagant lifestyle, each pimp kept a stable of prostitutes with a well-defined pecking order. At the top of each pimp’s organization was his “bottom girl,” a trusted and experienced prostitute or female associate. Next in the pimp’s chain of command was a “wife-inlaw,” a prostitute with supervisory duties similar to those of the bottom girl. A pimp’s bottom girl or wife-in-law often worked the track in his stead, running interference for and collecting money from the pimp’s other prostitutes. The bottom girl also looked after the pimp’s affairs if the pimp was out of town, incarcerated, or otherwise unavailable.

       WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Bush told a roomful of top Pentagon brass on Thursday that his administration would never stop looking for ways to harm the United States. The latest installment of misspeak from a president long known for his malapropisms came during a signing ceremony for a new $417 billion defense appropriations bill that includes $25 billion in emergency funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.    "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we,"  Bush said.   The Republican incumbent, who is in a tight race for reelection against Democrat John Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, used the 11-minute presentation to underscore his commitment to U.S. troops.  On hand for the ceremony were Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
