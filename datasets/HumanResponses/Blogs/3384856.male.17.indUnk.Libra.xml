      I need food. And right now the fridge is...well..."empty" is such a small word. I can't describe the emptiness of my fridge. It's unspeakably empty. Oh well...let's light up some more cigarettes...and listen to some music.  I just found out that there are other romanians here. I was suprised...in a pleasant way. Ahhh...my stomach is killing me. Damn it! I gotta cut this crap. All i do is complain and complain and complain.   Let's see...i'll try and find the beauty in these shitty past months. Well...i smoked alot...and ate good food and...had some sort of fun...but...that's all i think.  These past few months have been horrible. I don't know what got into me. I don't have the mood for nothing. I just want to lay down and do nothing. but i find that boring as well. School's more of a torture house for me...they keep nagging and nagging me with idiotic questions and stupid problems that will never be of any use to me. But i guess that's school...damn it!  PS: i'm not one of those characters that just want to kill themselves. I'm just having a shitty period and i hope i'll get over it soon...

      I just ate. French fries. Just letting you know. I feel kinda embarassed being here. What are people supposed to do when they read things like these? Because, i for one cannot explain it.  Damn it...i gotta stop writing like this.   PS: My back is hurting like hell.

      Well..for my second post i think i should say something about myself. I think. I'm not yet accustomed to this "thing" called Blog. Oh well..on with the show. I'm from Romania (i guess you never heard of that country before...just joking..i hope), i live in the town of Bucharest. Way too much info is not needed here. I like movies and music. And books. I'm going to get into details later. This time i want to make a general description. Well..as i was saying, i like movies, music and books. I like writing things also (movie scripts, poems and short stories). That's enough for one day. I'll be back later.  P.S: the next few days are going to be HELL on Earth for me, given the fact that i'm 17 and this week i have 2 final exams...it's going to be awful.

      well..this is my first post. i find it kinda strange though...leaving my thoughts in here..in this space...oh well...maybe i'll get used to it...i do hope so. i've never done this before and, like i said, i find it a little odd. a website where you can read other people's thoughts. what's the use? i guess i'm going to find out sooner or later.
