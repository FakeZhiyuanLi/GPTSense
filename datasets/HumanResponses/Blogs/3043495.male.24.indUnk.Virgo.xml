      It's bed time, but I've been wanting to write a quick note about the mp3's I have posted. The hosting package I bought gives me 10 MB of space, so that comes out to maybe 10 minutes of music, a little more if I use a lower bit rate. The point being that I can't have a lot of songs up at any one time. I may find another place to host them, but for now I'll just but up a few of my better ones, and rotate them every once in a while. I was thinking it might be good to do on a monthly basis. So these are the songs for April. You've been warned: download them before I rotate new ones in for May.  "t.s.g.f.m. (That Sexy Girl from Mississippi)" is about a girl I met through the  urlLink Truman Scholarship . (As an aside, Willamette just had  urlLink two more students win . That makes 8 in 6 years. Go bearcats!) I wrote it during the Summer of 2001 while I was in Eagle River, Alaska living with my dad and working as a checker at Carrs (owned by Safeway). I only wrote two songs that summer (the other is "Going Away") but they're both among my best.  It's one of my most popular songs because it does a feminist critique of itself halfway through. It's sort of like a point of convergence between the major themes of my songs: love, politics, and humor. This is the first stereo multi-track recording I've done, which I did sometime in February. It has vocals and harmonica panned to one side and guitar panned to the other.  I wrote "Mostly I'm Just Lonely" while I was studying in Quito, Ecuador fall of 2000. I wrote 10 songs during my the 4 months I spent there, but I only sing 3-4 of them these days, so it all amounts to about the same thing as just writing a few good ones, I suppose. I read somewhere that Dar Williams only writes 6 songs a year and that made me feel better.  Many people think this is my best song. The guitar part is based on this fingering of the C to G chord change where you leave your pinkie and ring fingers down fingering the G  (3x0003) and have the index and middle finger press down to finger the two notes to turn it into a C with a G in the bass (3x02013), never sounding the 5th string because it's not part of either chord. This is used on "Last Thing on My Mind" (Tom Paxton), "Boots of Spanish Leather" (Bob Dylan), and "Kathy's Song" (Simon and Garfunkel).  This recording is from the "Will Play for Food" benefit I did at Willamette in February 2001. I printed up a menu of songs for people to choose from. They bid for the right to pick the next song (I played for 2 hours and raised $159). Thanks to  urlLink John Vollmer  for the recording.  That's more extensive that I'd originally intended, but maybe someday I'll be able to borrow from this for liner notes to a CD.  --Russ

      Today I applied to work at Walgreens and Hollywood Video. This time around the plan is to apply for jobs around here for short-term work, while also applying for jobs I'd be interested in doing until I go to graduate school in a year or two. I was able to apply to both online--that's what they told me to do when I stopped by and asked if they're hiring.   This touches on something that's been bugging me lately: how much of my life centers around computers. It seems like nearly everything I want to do requires it. It's the place to look for jobs. It's the affordable way to record my music. I keep in touch with most of my friends via email since they're scattered across the globe. It's the place to go if I feel like writing anything. And I also manage to waste a bit of time playing addictive computer games from  urlLink Blizzard .   So yesterday I decided I'd have a TV free day and not turn the thing on. That was nice for a change. Sometimes I feel like my computer is a black hole that just sucks me in. I've been thinking about how we're moving towards doing more and more with computers--bills, banking, shopping where will it end? I wonder what that will mean for us. I know that my wrist problems are partially from doing computer stuff (as well as working as a grocery checker summer 2001 and playing guitar). It seems like cumulative trauma injuries are becoming more and more common each year. To some degree it's up to us. We can choose to talk on the phone (or write real letters, remember those?) instead of email or read a magazine instead of the web, but there are also many things we  have  to do on computers, like applying to work at Wallgreens and Hollywood Video.  Time to turn this thing off and read a book.  --Russ

      One of my favorite folk singers, Stephan Smith, has a new song about Bush called  urlLink You Ain't A Cowboy . Click on that link to listen to it for free. If you like it you can buy it (download the mp3) for $.99 as part of an online fundraiser for  urlLink True Majority , a group started by Ben of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream that works for progressive change in the U.S. You can download some free songs from his  urlLink website . I particularly recommend "The Bell" (with Pete Seeger), "The Darling Son" (opening for Ani Difranco), and "All Together Now" (from his debut on Rounder), but they're all very good.

      Well, here it is, my new blog (weblog) on my new web site. I hope that this can be my sister Annie’s website, too. Actually, it’s open to all of the Bither-Terrys in the world, but as far as we know that amounts to just the two of us.  A week ago today I’d just finished driving from San Francisco to my mom’s house in Manteca, California. I’d gotten a call that evening while still in the office telling me that I’d failed my apprenticeship as an organizer with the  urlLink Service Employees International Union  (“you don’t meet SEIU’s standards”). So I finished the flyer we were working on, went back to the hotel, packed up the car, and drove home.  It came as a bit of a surprise, both to me and to many of the other organizers in the office, several of whom said they disagreed. The woman who called me (who I’d never met) said the main issue was confidence. They didn’t feel I had what it takes to talk to a worker and inspire trust. She said this was based on their conversations with the organizers on my campaign, who expressed reservations about this issue. I think a big part of it was a personality conflict and some bad phone interactions with the woman directly responsible for coordinating my apprenticeship (who I met at my interview in L.A., but wasn’t in the office), but I’ll spare you the details.  I'm frustrated because I never got the chance to actually talk to a worker not already on board. The campaign I was working on was Head Start workers. There was one group that was already organized and about to get recognition and had established relationships with other organizers. I mostly scouted out sites where we were going to organizer next, hanging out in the area, keeping a low profile, and taking notes. So my flunking out is purely based on conjecture about my ability to effectively talk to a worker. Who knows? maybe I would have been bad at it, but I would have liked to give it a try.  So I’m back at the old job hunt. I have a lot of good options. Also, it’s nice to have some free time again (12 hour days and working on weekends were typical in the organizer job). This has given me a chance to do things like create this website, start writing a new batch of songs, read, and watch sitcoms. It’s hard to believe it was only a week ago: it seems like a life ago.  A year ago today I got arrested doing nonviolent civil disobedience in the Lafayette Park (across the street from the White House) organized by  urlLink Pax Christi  and the  urlLink Fellowship of Reconciliation . I was in the same paddy wagon as  urlLink Daniel Ellsberg  and had the pleasure of talking to him for hours. I’ve been reading his memoir,  Secrets , and highly recommend it. But don’t take my word for it, Martin Sheen says:  "The most important exposé of Washington since the Pentagon Papers themselves,  Secrets  is essential reading for any American who wants to understand true patriotism."  So, I’ve been reflecting some on what I did a year ago. I’m not proud of getting arrested opposing the war. I’m ashamed that I didn’t do more, that I only got arrested once. At least that’s how a part of me feels. The sacrifice was so small on my part: an afternoon and evening in police custody, the risk of a $50 fine (which I have yet to pay because it’s still in court where we’re challenging it on First Amendment grounds), being called “un-American,” etc. So why haven’t I done more? The trouble is, one can always do more. I’m not a big fan of beating ourselves up about it and wallowing in guilt. I don’t think it’s productive. Still, reading Ellsberg’s account of the Vietnam War, it is very clear to me that merely being opposed to the war has no real impact. If we actually want to put a stop to it we need to be willing to do something, and resistance usually requires some kind of sacrifice.  As I stood in the park singing and praying with the other activists, I had my doubts about if it would change anything. But doing nothing was certain to have no impact, and we never really know how much of an impact our actions have. I often ask myself the following regarding tactics: “If enough people did it would it work?” Often the answer is clearly yes, if enough people joined us we would succeed. So we might as well be the catalyst that gets things started.

      Where does the time go? I ask myself that a lot. And I'm only working like ten hours a week and not spending more than two hours a day on the job hunt. Plus I don't have kids!  How we use our time is an issue that never goes away. After all, our lives  are  how we spend them. And there will always be more things to do than time in which to spend them. So everything we choose to do something we're choosing  not  to do a bunch of other things(Economists call this "opportunity cost," one of the two useful things I learned in my intro microeconomics class freshman year). And each of those choices represents a value judgment--this is more important than that. Like I'm choosing to blog instead of cleaning the bathroom because making a fleeting effort to communicate with friends and family is more important to me (and the bathroom isn't that dirty).  I think most of us keep to-do lists to try and stay on top of the things we want/need to get done. I feel like mine are always going in too many directions at once (like my life perhaps), so I'm going to experiment with a 3-ring binder and loose leaf sheets and keeping separate lists for separate things: one for bills/money, one for the job hunt, one of people I need to call/write, one for music (people I owe CD's, songwriting contests to enter and such). We'll see how that goes. It feels like it'll be more manageable. Actually, there's a  urlLink To-Do List Magazine  (what's a post without a link, really?). It's put out by a woman named Sasha Cagen and uses to-do lists as a point of departure for discussing life. She also wrote a great book called Quirkyalone. It's about resisting the tyranny of coupledom. I'll do a post the book and the quirkyalone movement sometime soon.  But I'm demonstrating why I sometimes call myself Tangent Master (my superpower is the ability to derail any conversation). What I was getting at with the to-do list thing is how nice it feels when I'm cleaning up and I find a to-do list from a couple weeks ago. And I'm like "Did it, done, did it, decided not to, maybe I'll get around to it but don't really care, change of plans, did it, done." The stuff that was most important to me got done. That's been my experience every time I've found a to-do list buried on my desk.   I remember the guy who drove me to church choir practice when I lived in San Jose commenting about having a list of all the things that needed to get done this month, and how, at the end of the month it seemed some of the things didn't really need to get done after all because they weren't done and there was no big crisis.  My mom and I saw  urlLink Hellboy . She was just coming along and didn't expect to enjoy it, but she did. She found it refreshing that there was no swearing. It felt more like a comic book than most movies I've seen based on comics, in terms of dialog, the timing, the sense of humor, and visually there were scenes where I could really see how they would look on the page.  Tomorrow we're going to go see  urlLink Mean Girls . The title seems redundant to me. The script was written by Tina Fey, a writer for Saturday Night Live. It's based on a non-fiction book called Queen Bees and Wannabes about girls being, well, mean to each other in middle school and high school. I heard an  urlLink interview  with her on Thursday that was very good. She talked about how most teen movies are from a guy's point of view and this is different that way.  Today's fresh air had two people talking about Bush and religion (same link). It was really good and very scary. This is the problem with NPR. It's a temporal black hole if you're not careful. It's all this stuff that's interesting and informative and has no bearing on what you're trying to get done. And when people hear something good other people just have   to hear it to. I don't wake up to it anymore, because if I find the news story interesting and listen to it instead of getting out of bed. And, these days more than ever, the news is a terrible way to start your day, especially if you're not too fond of mornings to begin with.  Reminder: the current mp3's will be replaced by different ones for May. So download now or forever hold your peace.

      A while back I said I'd post lyrics to new songs, so here's a draft of my first ballad.  Ronald Reagan killed Ben Linder He said "I am a contra" and the contras killed Ben Claiming not to remember may have kept him in the White House But alzheimers won't absolve him of this sin  Ben Linder flew down to Nicaragua He'd just finished studying to be an engineer Went to go join the Sandinistas in their struggle against hunger, disease, ignorance and fear  In addition to his many other talents Ben Linder was also a clown The children would chase him as her rode his unicycle through the busy streets of Managua's downtown  But Otto Reich killed Ben Linder in his job spreading White House lies from the comfort of his Washington office he never had to hear an orphan's cries  Ben Linder headed to the campo to go live with the poor working on a hydroelectric project in the middle of a bloody civil war  Ben and his co-workers headed up the river to go measure the water flow they knew that it was dangerous but they still decided to go  A contra Ambush was waiting for them they threw grenades at them and showered them with lead the villagers arrived to find Ben Linder lying face down, a bullet to the head  Oliver North killed Ben Linder the same as if he'd stabbed him with a knife the Consitution that he pissed on may have kept him out of prison but there's no Fifth Amendment in the afterlife  In a cemetery in Matagalpa they lay to rest this man who died fighting for the poor and on his grave are these words: "The light he lit will shine forevermore."  Ben Linder gave his life to resist the insanity of the U.S. Empire if it seems a futile gesture, just remember it only takes a spark to start a fire  They killed Ben Linder's body but his spirit is present still in the work of those who continue the struggle because hope is something they just can't kill  There are so many other Iran-Contra people to include: Elliott Abrahams, John Negroponte, John Poindexter, George Bush the Elder... but I think it's too long as it is. I may even take out the Otto Reich verse. I've been throwing around a couple verse ideas. About Negroponte "...and now he's back again/...he's our Ambassador to the UN." Bush's comment when Ben died was that he was "on the other side." Side rhymes with died and pride, so maybe I'll do something there.  So, what do you think? I know it's hard without the music, especially since that lets me use rhythm to make draw things out or zip through them depending on how many words I have to get through. Still, criticism from others has helped me seriously improve songs. (Case in point: "Mostly I'm Just Lonely" once had the line "It's like my heart's got a semi-permeable membrane/ that keep out all the love and lets in all the pain." Thanks to Jamie Moshin for getting me to change that.)  Does it make sense? Some of you won't know much about this subjects covered. I hope it isn't the kind of song that only makes sense if you already know the story. Maybe it'll require classic singer-songwriter pre-song narration.

      A couple good political movies. The first one splices a preview for the reality TV show "The Apprentice" where  urlLink Trump Fires Bush . Thanks to Becky, one of my housemates when I lived in DC, for passing this on.   urlLink The Trojan Calf  is about the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). It's funny, and references both Homer and Monty Python.  urlLink The Quixote Center  (where I used to work) is using it to promote a full page sign on ad in the New York Times opposing CAFTA. Please consider signing on for $35 to have your name listed on the ad. I just did it online, it only takes a minute. The cartoon has a thing for you to click at the end if you want to sign on.

      Sorry it's been so long since my last post. Last week I was having a period of feeling indifferent and wanted to write about that and it took me a while to let my thoughts tumble around in my head for a while. During that time it seemed like if I were going to write I should write about that and I didn't want to write about it so I wrote nothing at all. It's sort of like when a college student has a book they want to read but doesn't read it because if they have time to read they should be reading for class, but they didn't want to read for class and ended up reading nothing at all. Which is twisted logic. That's why I always felt fine about skipping out on class reading for personal reading.  I've been thinking about how I care about the struggle for social justice, but do I  really  care? There's the question of how much you're willing to give in terms of time and energy. Lately I've been having my doubts.  I know that things change because people make them change. There's no magic secret, just being willing to do the work, and it's such hard work. There are so many frustrating things about it. Last year my sister Annie was co-chair of Willamette Students for Peace and Justice (WSPJ), which I'd led the year before. She'd call me up to complain about things that were driving her crazy--people flaking out on her, clashes of egos, etc. I'd listen to her and just be, like, "Yep, that's activism." But it can really wear you down.  Part of my sentiment is probably just the lingering bad taste in my mouth from the whole SEIU thing. I mean you go and say, "Sure I'll work twelve hour days, live out of a hotel room, and go wherever you send me." You're willing to do all that and then they say, "Nah, we don't want you. Go away."  I almost feel like I'm hearing "Nah, we don't want you. Go away." on a more general level, like that's what so many of the people being screwed by the system say to movements. I understand that there are many reasons for this, not the least of which is the ways in which we alienate people, but it's still hard is when the people with whom you want to work in solidarity don't seem receptive.   I know the answer is to be persistent and try harder, but sometimes it feels like you just want to give up. Sometimes I ask myself why bother standing up for people who won't bother to stand up for themselves. I have moments where I feel like if oppressed people want things to change, it's up to them to fight for it, I'm not going to stand in their way, but I'm not going to do it for them. That touches on a basic truth of social struggle, which is that people have to liberate themselves. So maybe I'll just watch and cheer from the sidelines.  I used to never be able to understand the people who agreed with me in principle but weren't willing to  do  anything, the whole "we're down with you man, but we won't be going to the meeting" deal. But lately I've been identifying. You see an injustice, recognize it as such, and realize you could do things that might address it--but there are other things that are more important to you. You're privileged and you know it's not fair, but you might as well enjoy it--life's short and what does it really matter in the end.  It's funny that California is in some ways worse for my cynicism than DC, but I think part of that is because I'm isolated instead of being in constant contact with inspiring, energetic, committed people (the other is that suburbs are evil). It's hard to have the strength to keep plugging along all by yourself, maybe even impossible. That's why it's so important to organize networks.  I know it's not that I don't care. It's probably just the result of caring too much and having that overload my circuits and make me go numb. Caring is reflexive for me. My mom's in Wall Mart filling my grandma's prescription and wants to buy a CD and some pencils for me. No. It comes without having to think about it. I won't shop there. I know they have the lowest prices and times are tight for a lot of people. I don't hold it against them, but things aren't tight enough for me to make whatever money I save be worth supporting everything they stand for. Perhaps resistance is futile, but not resisting is even more so.   That's what it always comes down to for me. I was having a beer and papusas with some Colombian trade unionists a little over a year ago, while discussing the topic of social change. "Hacemos lo que podemos," I said (We do what we can). "Y no podemos hacer mas," he repliced (And we can do no more).

      Star Wars goodness: There's a series of 3 minute cartoons covering some of the events of the Clone Wars, which begin with the battle at the end of Attack of The Clones (Episode II). They fill the time between Episodes II and III. They're pretty cool. They've released 20 chapters so far, and my friend said there will be 30 in all.  urlLink Watch them  and decide for yourself.  I think they're pretty cool. And this is coming from someone who isn't too impressed with the new movies (especially after I got over the whole Natalie Portman thing). The plot of the second one is somewhat interesting, but it seems the only consistently good parts are the lightsaber fights. Thus, I offer this solution so that Episode III won't suck: make it 90 minutes of lightsaber fights. There could be dialog, of course, but it'd need to be cool, manly, lightsaber fight dialog. Of course we know there will be one very important fight in Episode III: the one where Obi-Wan fights Anakin and knocks him into a pit of lava, crippling him and forcing him to don the Darth Vader armor with its respirator, etc.

      Happy Easter! Today was quite the day. My mom got a call at 1:30 AM because a very active member of the church had unexpectedly died from a heart attack. So she went to be with the family at the hospital. She got back around four and it was time to get ready for the 5:30 AM sunrise service. I hadn't been able to get to sleep until 12:30, so I had decided not to go to the sunrise service. It was her call at 9:30 that woke me up. I really need to learn to set an alarm even when I'm sure I'll wake up in time for something. So I hurried to get to the church in time to grab something to eat at the United Methodist Men's breakfast before going to the 10:30 service. There was also an 8:30 service. She'd gone to sleep around 10:30 PM the night before, so she did three services on three hours sleep!   When we got back she made pie crust and took a nap while I finished two pecan pies for a 5:00 dinner party at the home of the director of youth and children's ministry, Lisa Brown. It was a birthday party for her son Ryan and also for her husband Kirk. My mom charged me with the task of writing a song for Ryan to celebrate his 16th birthday. Last fall she had me write a song for Lisa Brown Appreciation Day at the church. I put new words to "Yellow Submarine." I decided to stick with the Beatles and put new words to "When I'm Sixty-Four," which I threw together yesterday. Anyhow, I said I'd post song lyrics, so here you are:  [G]Well you get older, a day at a time, and here you are [D7]now, you've made sixteen laps around the sun, but the adventure has [G]only begun You may stop to ask yourself, [G7]what does it all [C]mean? Will you be [Eb7]driving? [G]I hope you'll be [E7]thriving, [A7] now that [D7]you're six-[G]teen.  [G]Now that you older you got more responsibili[D7]ty Your parents might let you stay out late, or go on an [G]unchaperoned date But if you stay out 'till quarter to three, [G7]there's gonna be a [C]scene Will you be [Eb7]driving? [G]I hope you'll be [E7]thriving, [A7] now that [D7]you're six-[G]teen.  [Em]Hmm------[D]mmm------[Em]mmmh. [Em]Playing baseball until [B7]dark.  [Em]and when you're[Am] up to bat, I hope you[C]hit it[D7]out of the [G]park.  [G]If you go and get your license, you can drive yourself to [D7]school but be sure not to drive too fast, if you want the [G]fun to last If you got a speeding ticket [G7]that wouldn't be too [C]keen Will you be [Eb7]driving? [G]I hope you'll be [E7]thriving, [A7] now that [D7]you're six-[G]teen.

      So, I've been meaning to mention this: I got a job! Sort of. The custodian at my mom's church got fired because he blew up at the secretary (and wasn't keeping things clean), so once again I'm filling in until they find someone (I did the job for six weeks or so last fall). Anyhow, it's enough to pay my health insurance and student loan payment and such. They might have someone lined up to start in May, but it buys me a little more time to find a full-time job.  I spent a good chunk of time getting my computer squared away. I reformatted my hard drive and re-installed Windows XP because things weren't working quite right when I installed in over the files already on my computer. But I'm not out of the woods yet. I'll probably wind up going with Windows 2000 because it has lower system requirements and from what I've been reading online it'll run better on my computer, since it's a few years old and XP is designed for newer machines. So I'm not going to install much software just yet, and will mainly use this for getting online until get set up on Windows 2000. It's annoying that different software will only run of different operating systems. Anyhow, enough tech talk.  When I was trying to clear up space on my hard drive yesterday (this is a segue, I promise) I deleted a bunch of mp3's. When I started iTunes said I had like 9 or 10  days  of music. I got it down to around 5.5 (and then erased it all the next day). I have it all backed up on data CD's. Besides, I was realizing that I've never listened to a large part of it and a lot of it I don't even like. Like Dave Matthews. I just had their stuff because they're popular. While I respect their technical abilities as musicians they do nothing for me as song writers. I could never clearly articulate why I felt this way. I didn't have to. Jack Black (of Tenacious D) wrote exactly what I wanted to say:  "They seem like style without substance, form without content, like a simulation of music without really being music." (Guitar Legends, Spring 2004 p. 97)  But feel free to disagree.  Since blogs serve the function of allowing people with too much free time to make others feel guilty about not having the time to read the news, it is my duty to link to a good opinion piece (as an aside, Arianna Huffington recently wrote about  urlLink why she loves blogs ).   Molly Ivins has a piece entitled  urlLink "Iraq: What. A. Mess." . Some Cliff Note hi-lights for those of you who don't have time to read it because you have jobs, kids, etc.:  "Just for the record, occupiers purporting to bring democracy should never shut down newspapers."  "...the First Rule of Holes (when you're in one, quit digging.)"  "If I were John Kerry, I would be having such horrible nightmares about winning the election and actually having to ask an American soldier to be the last man to die for a mistake. "  Some other time I'll write up some thoughts on why many of my favorite leftists come from places where they are in the minority (she's from Texas).

      Just a quick note to point out the comment feature. Just click the "comment" link at the bottom of a post to write your thoughts or response or whatever. This is courtesy of  urlLink Comment This . I guess they're actually the ones who host the comments. I don't really know how it works, the site just said to paste in some text in my blog template and I did what it said and now it works. Just know that everyone can read the comments you post. So if you want to privately declare your undying love for me this probably isn't the best way to do that. You can even respond to other people's comments. Who knows you might meet cool people (like I'd waste my valuable time with people who aren't cool).  The wireless access point and notebook card that I purchased arrived today. Windows 98 doesn't support it, so I'm attempting to upgrade to XP. It's installing right now. Wish me luck. I'm writing this from my mom's laptop. The advantage of wireless is that I'd be able to do computer stuff at the ergonomically correct desk and chair in my room instead of in the living room or dining room. Hopefully XP will clear up the issue I've been having with drivers and not being able to use my track ball and external keyboard at the same time. But I think I complained about that in a previous post. All I have to say is I think my next computer will be an iBook.   Sorry to be boring. My friend Jason Slemons suggested I post lyrics to my songs, which is a good idea. So look for that soon. Also, I'm going to post draft lyrics for a new song or two (perhaps a song about how much I hate drivers). It's funny, being in a slump is good for the creative process. More on that some other time.  Ok, one other thing: Blogger's spell check doesn't have the word "blog" in its dictionary.

      Crazy site for today:  urlLink The Cyborg Name Generator . My friend Jay was in the Bay Area visiting law schools, so I met him and some of his friends in San Francisco Thursday night. We hung out in the Haight/Ashbury area and then Jay and I spent the night with his friend Andy who lives out at Point Reyes. He works for the park so he lives in an apartment right by the lighthouse. It was really amazing.  Anyhow, Friday morning we drove into Berkeley so Jay could go to his thing for prospies at Bolt and Andy and I met up with my cousin Hilary who is in her third year there. Andy mentioned this site and Hilary whipped out her laptop. The cafe was, naturally, a wireless hot spot, so she looked it right up. You type in your name and it gives you a cyborg acronym. Russell gives you "Robotic Upgraded Soldier Skilled in Exploration and Logical Learning." Hilary was "Hydraulic Intelligent Lifeform Assembled for Repair and Yelling." It shows you this spelled out next to a picture of an android. Then it gives you the option of buying overpriced T-shirts and mugs with the cyborg name. This has the potential to suck up a good bit of time. Hillary said, "Great. Now I have something to do during my Family Law class!"

      I've started the long and arduous process of making a list of links for the side bar. I'll keep adding a few at a time. I will eventually have a separate page which is an annotated version of the same link list, because it annoys me when someone throws a bunch of links at me and doesn't tell me what I can expect to find if I click on a given link. So my policy here at Russell's Ramblings is to explain every link so you'll know in advance if it's something you want to look at. Your time is valuable, dear readers, and I respect that.  Speaking of time, I need to start spending mine on some cover letters that are due soon.  Oh, look for new music for the month of June.

      "'I'm going to get our troops home as fast as possible with honor and the job accomplished in the way it needs to be.'"  Richard Nixon? George Bush? Nope, John Kerry.  I heard him say that on NPR and tracked it down in an   urlLink article  in the Boston Globe. It'd be fun to find a Nixon (or Johnson) statement that is close to the one quoted above.  For the record, I am not saying that it's not important to beat Bush or anything like that, but it's important to remember that that the Democrats are part of the problem, too.

      When I observed the election in Guatemala last November, my partner was an anthropologist named Steve Austin. He was familiar with the area we went to because he did his dissertation research there. In the states he works with Native American tribes trying to get legal recognition. He emailed me a  urlLink news article  about one of his current cases. He writes:  "Here's an article that describes some of what I've been involved in for the past two years.  We are having a difficult fight with the Attorney General of Connecticut, but the Schaghticoke Tribe will win its case."

      Time for more song lyrics. I promise I'll start recording some of my new songs soon. Annie really likes this one. She'll be here on the 18th to visit before going back to Salem. I'll teach her how to blog then, and she'll be hopelessly addicted [insert villain laugh here].  By the way--and this should be obvious to anyone who knows me--this isn't about my life. It's from the perspective of a fictional person.  Bad for Me  I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt  There's nothing like a cigarette's nicotine buzz Laced with an extra thrill because They kill my lungs, give me shortness of breath Each one brings me a bit closer to death  I like things that are bad for me Like cigarettes And you  I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt  It's not just that I smoke I fill up on sugar drinking root beer and Coke Cookies, ice cream and cake How much difference does it really make?  I like things that are bad for me Like sugar, cigarettes  And you  I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt  My friend Jack he serves me well Helps me forget that I'm living in Hell In the morning DTs make me shake and shiver And I've damn near killed my liver  I like things that are bad for me Like booze, sugar, cigarettes And you  I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt  The doctor says I'm clogging my arteries To Hell with him I'll eat what I please Eggs and bacon, burgers and fries Sooner or later everyone dies  I like things that are bad for me Like greasy food, booze, sugar, cigarettes And you   I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt  I read in poor lighting it's bad for my eyes And I never exercise I watch TV as I sit on the couch My back hurts because I always slouch  [bridge] You have no respect for me You think that I'm worth less than dirt But I stay with you because I agree And I like things that hurt  If someone asked me my worst vice I would not have to think twice It's you  There is no mystery I know what's killing me It's you  I like things that are bad for me I like things that hurt That must be why I love you

      Mother's Day Proclamation - 1870  by Julia Ward Howe  Arise then...women of this day! Arise, all women who have hearts! Whether your baptism be of water or of tears! Say firmly: "We will not have questions answered by irrelevant agencies, Our husbands will not come to us, reeking with carnage, For caresses and applause. Our sons shall not be taken from us to unlearn All that we have been able to teach them of charity, mercy and patience. We, the women of one country, Will be too tender of those of another country To allow our sons to be trained to injure theirs."   From the voice of a devastated Earth a voice goes up with Our own. It says: "Disarm! Disarm! The sword of murder is not the balance of justice." Blood does not wipe our dishonor, Nor violence indicate possession. As men have often forsaken the plough and the anvil  At the summons of war, Let women now leave all that may be left of home For a great and earnest day of counsel. Let them meet first, as women, to bewail and commemorate the dead. Let them solemnly take counsel with each other as to the means Whereby the great human family can live in peace... Each bearing after his own time the sacred impress, not of Caesar, But of God - In the name of womanhood and humanity, I earnestly ask That a general congress of women without limit of nationality, May be appointed and held at someplace deemed most convenient And the earliest period consistent with its objects, To promote the alliance of the different nationalities, The amicable settlement of international questions, The great and general interests of peace.    urlLink link   All I have to say is it's a long way from that to Hallmark cards and cut flowers.  The National Women's History Project has a good  urlLink article  on the history of Mother's Day. I first read about the holiday's anti-war origins in the book "God and Other Famous Liberals" by Forrest Church (Senator Frank Church's son), which is a pretty good book (though it's a strong contender for Worst Cover Design Ever. If you don't believe me look  urlLink here ).

      Ever wondered what Christian theologian you most closely resemble? Me neither. But here's my results from a brief, fun, interesting, and--for me--pretty accurate online quiz:        "It is the chiefest point of happiness that a man is willing to be what he is."         You are Desiderius Erasmus!   You have great love for others and will do just about anything to show it to them. You are tolerant  and avoid confrontations, so people generally are drawn to you. You are more quiet and reserved in  front of strangers, but around some people you open up. When things get tough, you like to meditate  alone. Unfortunately you often get things like "what a pansy," or "you're such a liberal."        urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson

      Happy Cinco de Mayo! This will be the second of three posts on the forgotten politics of holidays in the month of May. The third will be Mother's Day (Will these commie pinkos stop at nothing? Is nothing sacred? Mothers' Day!) which actually began as an anti-war holiday.  I like to remind people that Cinco de Mayo is an anti-imperialist holiday. It celebrates Mexico kicking the French invaders out. Here's a link to a brief summary of the history:   urlLink http://www.mexonline.com/cinco.htm   This one goes into more detail and argues for why the holiday should be important in the U.S., too. It's a bit militaristic and nationalistic, but raises some interesting points:   urlLink http://www.vivacincodemayo.org/history.htm   My "research," by the way, consisted of typing "Cinco de Mayo history" into google and skimming the top two links.  I think the events commemorated today ought to serve as a reminder that people generally don't like to have their country occupied by a foreign colonial power seeking to plunder their resources and undermine their right to self-determination. Read into that what you will. (Napoleon III = Bush II, Maximilian = Bremer, etc.)  P.S. I google searched Bremer's name to make sure I spelled it right. I got his bio on the  urlLink Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) website , which is a hoot (and payed for with your tax money, I'm sure). I wouldn't be suprised if they check out everyone who links to them and will add this to my FBI file, but if we're afraid to speak out they've already won, right?

      I'm a big fan of the  urlLink National Security Archives  at George Washington Univeristy. They use the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain documents related to U.S. foreign policy and then publish and archive them.   Below is a piece from the Washington Post that draws upon their work as it discusses the absurdity of many things that get classified, such as Augusto Pinochet's favorite drink. You can see the documents referred to  urlLink here.    The Archive website has a lot of useful documents posted on it. The next time your friend or in-law claims that the principle aim U.S. foreign policy is to promote human rights and democracy you can send tell her or him to check it out (after you stop laughing). You can sign up to get email updates, which I've found quite interesting. Anyway, here's the piece from theWashington Post:  Millions of Secrets   By Al Kamen Monday, May 3, 2004; Page A19   The way things are going, it's getting to where even The Shadow won't know "what evil lurks in the hearts of men." And forget that lurking-in-the-heart stuff, pretty soon the old radio detective won't even be able to find out what your government has been doing for you.   Executive branch agencies -- mostly the CIA, the Pentagon, the spy satellite folks and the Justice Department -- discovered more than 14 million new secrets last year, according to a report to the president by the Information Security Oversight Office, part of the National Archives.   That's a 25 percent increase over the prior year in creating things that must be "secret." Just before Sept. 11, 2001, the rate was 8 million a year. So that's a substantial surge in the urge to submerge. (Sorry.)   "Many senior officials will candidly acknowledge that the government classifies too much information," ISOO said in its March 31 report, "although oftentimes the observation is made with respect to the activities of agencies other than their own."   And sometimes it's hard to remember what you've deemed a "(b)(1)" secret, which is something "in the interest of national defense or foreign policy" of the nation.   So, for example, the National Security Archive at George Washington University got a Defense Intelligence Agency biographical sketch of our old pal Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1999. This was released in full as part of the Clinton administration's declassification on Chile, Latin America's strongest democracy until Pinochet's coup in 1973.   Then, in response to ongoing Freedom of Information Act requests, DIA released the same bio again in 2003 but, to protect our security, blacked out the really secret information.   For example, both versions describe him as "Caucasian" with an "oval face and a mustache." We're allowed to know he wears reading glasses and is "quiet." But the new version has blacked out this part: [WARNING: If You Do Not Have An "Eyes Only" Clearance, Do Not Continue Reading!] "Mild-mannered; very businesslike. Very honest, hard working, dedicated. A devoted, tolerant husband and father; lives very modestly. Drinks scotch and pisco sours; smokes cigarettes; likes parties. Sports interests are fencing, boxing and horseback riding. . . . Enjoys discussing world military problems and would respond to a frank, man-to-man approach."   Pisco sours?   Really Top Secret!   National Park Service space and facility specialist Jim Banton sent an e-mail Tuesday to all NPS employees warning of a water problem at headquarters:   "Due to an unexpected water leak late yesterday afternoon . . . the building engineer" shut off the water in the building. "Please remember when using the drinking water fountains [to] let the water run for 30 seconds or more before drinking the water."   Straightforward enough. But it included this warning: "The information contained in this communication may be confidential, is intended only for the use of the recipient named above" -- in this case, just a few thousand people -- "and may be legally privileged. If the reader of this message is not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution, or copying of this communication, or any of its contents is strictly prohibited. If you have received this communication in error, please re-send this communication to the sender and delete the original message and any copy of it from your computer system. Thank you."   Yikes! Legally privileged! Strictly prohibited! Guess we better get lawyered-up.   urlLink http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61425-2004May2.html

      Sita, one of my best friends from Willamette, has a new  urlLink ART HOME PAGE   Her art is really great--see for yourselves. Her paintings are very colorful w/ a Latin influence.   Her husband Miguel is from Mexico. He's a member of the  urlLink Son Sur International Ensemble :  "The principal objective of SON SUR INTERNATIONAL ENSEMBLE is to diffuse this rich Caribbean music, continuing and deepening the process of cultural syncretism by adapting Mexican music to Caribbean and Veracruzian rhythms and structures."  I met him while I was in San Francisco working for the union. He's a really great guy. We swapped songs in my hotel room for a while--he's a really gifted musician. And guitar isn't even his principle instrument! Anyhow, check out the free mp3's on the site. They're quite good.

      As promised I've put up new songs for May. The first is Liberty Street, about a street in Salem, Oregon where I lived for four years while attending  urlLink Willamette University . It's about economic injustice, so I figured it goes well with the May Day theme. This recording is from spring of 2001. My roommate Seth recorded it.  The other, Drunken Fratboy, is set to the tune of the folk song Drunken Sailor, and is my artistic contribution to getting rid of The Shrub. I'm sure Democrats will love my urging to "vote him out in 2004," but many will be less ready to take my advise to "bring all the troops home now." More on that some other time. Anyhow, I played this song at a protest last August in front of Rumsfeld's house. It went over well. A guy video taped it and recently sent me the tape.   I made this recording at my friend Nate's house in North East DC. Kristen, who plays drums and sings backup vocals, was the anti-war organizer at the  urlLink Quixote Center  (where I was working) until she took a position at  urlLink Code Pink , a women's peace group, and the group that organized the demo mentioned above.

      Happy May Day! This is Labor Day in most countries.   Michelle Cobban writes:  "The first May Day, in 1886, was a call for eight-hour workdays by the workers in many American cities; it is now mostly associated with the Haymarket Martyrs. A bomb thrown by an unknown person at a labor rally in Chicago's Haymarket Square killed one policeman; authorities rounded up whom they considered to be the leaders of the local labor movement and put them on trial. Mother Jones said of the incident: "The workers asked only for bread and a shortening of the long hours of toil. The agitators gave them visions. The police gave them clubs."   "The charge against the accused, eight anarchists, was conspiracy--labor unions were illegal at the time under conspiracy laws. The prosecution summed up their arguments with: "Anarchy is on trial...[These men] are no more guilty than those thousands who follow them...convict these men, make examples of them, hang them and you save our institutions, our society." All were found guilty; four of the eight were hanged, one committed suicide in jail, and the remaining three were freed years later when public opinion turned against the rigged trial."  Read  urlLink the entire article  for more on the history of the holiday.  It's sad there are a lot of people in other countries who know more about U.S. labor history than most people in the U.S. When I was in Cuba in March 2001 I visited the new plaza they built for demonstrations in front of the U.S. Interest Section (which we have instead of an embassy because we don't have official relations) during the Elian Gonzalez drama. (It feels odd to me to have the government in the business of organizing demonstrations.)   They had four sets of plaques remembering people: one for Cubans, one for Latin Americans, one for people in North America, and one for people from other parts of the world. It was interesting that many of the people from the U.S. they commemorated were the same people we hold up as heroes here: Lincoln, Tubman, King, Whitman, Edison, Franklin, Malcolm X, and the Haymarket Martyrs, and others. No slave owners, naturally.  Of course, this is also the day Shrub chose to announce that the war was over. I don't know if that was intentional. He visited El Salvador on the 20th anniversary of Oscar Romero's death, so I wouldn't put it past this bunch. In any case there's some kind of poetry to it: he flew a plane on May Day, which is what pilots cry out over the radio when they're in a mess and falling fast, which seems to describe the situation in Iraq pretty well these days.

      Yesterday I sent the following email to my mass email list. Please feel free to paste it into an email and send it to anyone you think might like the song.   Dear friends,  I've recently created a music page at Download.com where you can download free mp3's of my songs. A recent addition is "Drunken Fratboy," a song I wrote last summer about Bush and the war in Iraq. I played it at a Code Pink demonstration in front of Rumsfeld's house in August 2003, and it was very well received.  The recording features my friend Kristen, an organizer with Code Pink, on drums and backup vocals. It's set to the tune of the old folk song "Drunken Sailor." If feel the song is even more relevant today than it was then when I wrote it, especially when I call for the troops to come home and to give Bush the boot this November.  Here are the verses:  Where are the weapons of mass destruction (3x) They told us to be scared of? Send Bush and Blair to Iraq to find them (3x) They might be there a while  What do we do with Cheney and Rumsfeld (3x) Those two chicken hawks? Draft them in the Army let them fight the next war (3x) All by themselves  What do we do with the troops in Iraq (3x) Beneath the blazing sun? Bring all the troops home now (3x) I'm sure they miss their families  What do you do with a drunken frat boy (3x) Sitting in the White House Vote him out in 2004 (3x) Don't elect him this time either  Download.com keeps track of how many times a song is downloaded. Each week they publish the most downloaded songs of the week (the top ones usually have a few thousand downloads). If we can get a lot of people to download this song it will make a statement and bring it to even more people's attention. Please take the time to download the song (and, if you want, check out the other songs I have on the site).   And, most importantly, if you like the song please send a message to any friends that you think would also enjoy the song. I'm hoping that things will snowball and we'll make it one of the most downloaded songs this week. The week ends Sunday, so please try to download it by then. Of course, a download at any time is much appreciated.  My download.com page:   urlLink http://music.download.com/russellbitherterry/3600-8972_32-100252309.html?tag=list#songs   In love and solidarity, Russell

When told that he needs to let him go because he has the right to run, the man replies "To hell with his rights. WE'RE TRYING TO STOP FASCISTS!!"  In other news the NPR jazz program I'm listening to as I write this is playing an instrumental verzion of Neil Young's "Old Man," and it's just wrong.

      Today in church we surprised my mom by celebrating her completion of thirty years as a pastor. They were announcing visitors in church. Lisa Brown, director of children and youth ministry said we had some other visitors and in walked my sister Annie, who flew down from Oregon, and my grandma, who drove down from Sacramento. My mom was amazed.   The church gave her a new stole that a woman in the church made for her with wheat and grapes on it. It's really beautiful. Annie read some passages from a book. (Once again) I was given the task of writing a song for the occasion, and (once again) I put new lyrics to a Beatles tune. I got the congregation to sing with me on the chorus. That was fun.  30 Years To the tune of "Let it Be"  She headed out to seminary young and full of hopes and fears and now she's been a pastor 30 years In Alameda, Berkeley and Citrus Heights she proved she's as good as her male peers and now she's been a pastor 30 years  Chorus: 30 years, 30 years 30 years, 30 years she has been a pastor 30 years  Next it was off to Alaska the place they call the Last Frontier and now she's been a pastor 30 years Then down to San Jose to a church full of computer engineers and now she's been a pastor 30 years  Chorus  After that she moved to Whitefish, Montana where drivers must be careful not to hit the deer and now she's been a pastor 30 years and then to Worland, Wyoming with ranchers on horseback herding steer and now she's been a pastor 30 years  Chorus  Well now that's her story she's lived lots of places and now she's here and now she's been a pastor 30 years The sixth woman ordained in the [Cal-Nevada] Conference she blazed the trail for others to make it their career and now she's been a pastor 30 years  Chorus

      I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  last night. It was amazing and made me really mad. It wasn't showing in Manteca, so we saw the 7:20 showing in Modesto. We had to sit way up in front because the theatre was so full! So that's encouraging. I'll write more about it later, but I encourage everyone to see it as soon as possible and drag your friends along. If it sells a lot of tickets that will send a strong message and mean more media coverage which brings us that much closer to getting rid of Bush.

      Tuesday I picked up Slash and Burn,  urlLink Stephan Smith 's new CD. It's great and includes the song  You Ain't A Cowboy , which I plugged a few months ago. You can listen to songs from the album on his site, and download songs from previous albums. Be sure to check out "The Bell." It was the most played anti-war song before the war in Iraq.  I had to special order it at the local CD store. In many ways it's easier to just use Amazon or whatever and it often feels like the extra money you pay for postage is worth the time saved. But I'm going to make an effort to special order books and CD's from local independent stores, because it supports the local economy and builds a sense of community. Also, if enough people special order something they're likely to start carrying it, meaning that more people will be exposed to it.  A couple friends and I saw Stephan play in Davis a few weeks ago (June 4). It was a benefit for the local community radio station  urlLink KDVS . There was a small turnout, which made for a more intimate environment.   It also meant that I got to talk to him a fair amount both before and after the show. I'd met Stephan in person in September 2002 when he played at a protest in Washington, DC, where I was living at the time. We've corresponded periodically via email since summer 2001, and he played a benefit for  urlLink Quest for Peace  last October. I sent him a demo in 2001, but I bought him a short CD with some of my new stuff. He said it was cool because he needed music to listen to in the car when driving to Portland on Sunday. We'd been talking about my job hunt and he said to give him a call on Sunday on his cell phone to talk some more while he was driving. When I called him he was driving through Southern Oregon and said he'd gotten "Drunken Fratboy" stuck in his head! (There should be a link to the song in the sidebar to the right until the end of the month. After that you'll have to visit  urlLink my download.com site ).

      Just another plug for the MP3 of the Month. It'll only be up for a little over a week, so download it before it's too late. I've typed up the lyrics, below. I'm really slacking on getting other sections up on this site, including one with song lyrics. It'll happen eventually.  a song for carolyn (2003)  if peter pan came to my window  said "fly away with me "we'll go to never never land  "be forever young and free "all you need to fly is a happy thought" you are what mine would be  if i were with harry potter and the dementors came near those prison guards so terrible fill everyone with fear the protection spell requires a happy thought i'd think of you my dear  chorus: it's such a simple thing to say but i like you a lot you brighten a gloomy day yes you;re my happy thought  sometimes good things happen without us knowing why i know that i can't let this one pass me by and that i'd like nothing better than to be your guy  chorus

      I've created another blog (because, really, having only one blog is  so last year ). This one is called  Small World Stories . Any of you who know me know that my life is full of them. I'd been thinking it'd be good to compile them to keep track. This will be an easy way to do that and might afford others the chance to share their stories, too. I just posted my first story, pretty much chosen at random. Also, there's no need to check both blogs. Every time there's a new post to  Small World Stories  I'll make note of it on  Russell's Ramblings . Here's the link:   urlLink http://smallworldstories.blogspot.com/

      I just saw  urlLink The Stepford Wives . I enjoyed it. It's very different from the book, but they did an interesting take on it. Now I want to see the original movie.  Has anyone else noticed how previews for movies sometimes show scenes that aren't actually in the movie? The first time I noticed this was a movie I'm ashamed to admit I went to:  Inspector Gadget . Hey, I liked the cartoon as a kid, okay? There's a preview of steam shooting out his ears when he's with some woman that wasn't in the movie. I'm pretty sure. Maybe I went to the bathroom or something. It was several years ago.  The preview for  Mean Girls  shows the main character removing bolts from under the popular girls' table so it collapses and they get food all over them. Wasn't in the movie. In the preview for  Stepford Wives  Joanna (Nicole Kidman) asks Walter (Matthew Broderick) if he'd change something about her by just pushing a button if he could. So I was expecting that line when the scene came, but it wasn't there.  I wonder if this is done to keep us on our toes, because we don't "know" the things we think we know, or if it's because the previews come out before the final edit. On a certain level one could argue it's false advertising.

       Flag Day   This was widely circulated around this time last year, but in case you haven't seen it:  What the American Flag Stands For   by Charlotte Aldebron     The American flag stands for the fact that cloth can be very important. It is against the law to let the flag touch the ground or to leave the flag flying when the weather is bad. The flag has to be treated with respect. You can tell just how important this cloth is because when you compare it to people, it gets much better treatment. Nobody cares if a homeless person touches the ground. A homeless person can lie all over the ground all night long without anyone picking him up, folding him neatly and sheltering him from the rain.   School children have to pledge loyalty to this piece of cloth every morning. No one has to pledge loyalty to justice and equality and human decency. No one has to promise that people will get a fair wage, or enough food to eat, or affordable medicine, or clean water, or air free of harmful chemicals. But we all have to promise to love a rectangle of red, white, and blue cloth.   Betsy Ross would be quite surprised to see how successful her creation has become. But Thomas Jefferson would be disappointed to see how little of the flag's real meaning remains.    Charlotte Aldebron, 12, wrote this essay for a competition in her 6th grade English class. She attends Cunningham Middle School in Presque Isle, Maine.      urlLink link

      Avoiding TV news today (usually a good idea, in any case) given the around-the-clock Reagan stuff. I was thinking or recording the  urlLink Ben Linder song  today, but I just changed the guitar part so I need to get that down better.   [warning two sentences of guitar nerd stuff]I had been just playing G C and D chords in first position in standard tuning. So I messed around with a double-drop D tuning (DADGBD) with a variety of chord voicings and it sounds much more interesting than before. I hope to have it up as the MP3 of the Month for July.  My last post mentioned a review of Thomas Frank's new book. I'm listening to an  urlLink interview  with him on Fresh Air with Terry Gross. It's really good, even by NPR standards. Check it out if you want to better understand conservatives, culture war, class war, etc. He explains how they manage to the business class together with the blue collar "Middle Americans" they exploit.  Yesterday my mom got out the boom box while I was mopping the gym floor at the church. She put it on NPR. I was, like, silly Mom, always listening to NPR, I'm going to put it on the Classic Rock station. But before I could change the station, which was playing The World on PRI, I found myself interested in the story about how the European Parliament packs up and moves for a week out of every month so they can be in Strasbourg because it represents reconciliation between France and Germany (the rest of the time they're in Brussels). Ridiculous, but also fascinating. Then the had an interview with Alfonso Cuarón, director of the new Harry Potter movie. So I listened to that. Once you get started it just sucks you in. But sometimes I don't feel like thinking, I just want to rock out.

      On a number of occasions I've had people ask me how I manage to stay "so well informed." The answer is that I don't, but to the degree that I know anything about anything regarding public affairs, here's my main secret: I read  urlLink The Nation  (Okay so a BA in politics helps, too). I read random other stuff, too, but I don't read anything nearly as regularly. For those who haven't hear of it, it's the country's oldest political monthly, filled with investigative reporting and analysis you won't find in the major media. My tip to people who feel overwhelmed as they try to figure out the crazy world of activism and politics is read the Nation. It will provide a good well rounded coverage of important issues, which you can then supplement with other sources.  The spring book review issue just arrived today. It has a great book review talking about why so many poor people and middle class people vote Republican and screw themselves over (culture war vs. class war):   urlLink How the Other Half Votes   The nice thing about their book reviews is they give you some nuggets of the better stuff from the book, since you probably won't have time to actually read very many of the books reviewed.

      I finally got my picture loaded to my new  urlLink Download.com Music site . It only took me about three weeks. First it rejected it because it wasn't a perfect square, then after I made it square it said it was corrupted. Each time I had to wait for someone to approve my other changes before I could submit again. I'm just happy to have it up, because I was waiting for the photo before publicizing it.  Anyhow, Download.com lets me host up to 50 MB of mp3's (192 bps) on their site, with a profile page (including a link to this website). I've had over 100 downloads just from people browsing. Right now I've just got the songs from April archived (Mostly I'm Just Lonely, and That Sexy Girl From Mississippi), but I'll be putting some more of my most popular songs up. The nice thing about having them there instead of here is that if they become really popular I don't have to worry about exceeding my monthly data transfer limit. Anyhow, check them out, download stuff, and tell anyone you think might be interested. But don't just go to my site, I've been listening to some of the other folk artists, and there's a lot of good stuff on there, all free.

      A quick composition. Half an hour or so ago I decided to modernize Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two), which was written in 1892:   Daisy, my bride-to-be, I hate to complain But as you've probably noticed, gas prices are insane It seems like every morning, there's another smog warning So after the cake what a statement we'll make on a bicycle built for two.   Walter, my future groom, oh how right you are There are better ways to travel than an Earth-killing car A limo SUV is not the thing for me. So, yes it'd be swell to give 'em all Hell on a bicycle built for two.   I came up with the second verse in the course of typing up the first one...

      From an opinion piece in today's Manteca Bulletin (quoting a woman named Barbara Jupin who spoke at the Union Cemetery on Memorial Day):  "I'm taking a guess here, but I would imagine that about 80 percent of the people who are complaining about their stay in our containment centers have never been treated so well in their lives. They're warm and dry. They're fed and they're clean. If they are injured, they're taken care of. They know they're protected."  She makes Abu Ghraib sound like the Holiday Inn.  I've got to get out of this place. If it's the last thing I ever do...  Actually, 80 percent falls smack dab in the middle of the Red Cross estimate for how many of the people we've imprisoned in Iraq are innocent:   In a report in February, the Red Cross stated that some military intelligence officers estimated that 70 percent to 90 percent of "the persons deprived of their liberty in Iraq had been arrested by mistake." Of the 43,000 Iraqis who have been imprisoned at some point during the occupation, only about 600 have been referred to Iraqi authorities for prosecution, according to U.S. officials.

      As promised I've posted new music for the month of June. I picked this one because it makes a reference to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (book 3 for all you ultra-muggles) and  urlLink the movie  opens this Friday! So now more people will know what a dementor is.  I've decided to only post one "Mp3 of the Month" each month because I'll be hosting my more standard material on another site (more on that later). So this will be for more obscure stuff that you'd have to know me to appreciate.  Once again that's my friend Kristen on the drums. This was a first take. I'm not sure she'd even heard the song before, so suffice it to say it's a little rough. I wrote it 12/02-1/03 and recorded it last summer at my friend Nate's house in DC.

      Here are the lyrics to a new song, in semi final form. This song has been almost done for a few weeks now. Today I went through it a couple more times and worked the rest of it out. I'll probably make some minor changes as I sing it more--that seems to be part of the process.   Toy Aisle   Whenever I'm in a big box store I swing by the toy aisle  To poke around and see what's new and reminisce a while   They've got rubber balls for kids to kick around in their yards  And for a rainy day they've got board games and playing cards   I continue looking through the nifty toys  And find a bag of plastic Indians and cowboys  [contrasting melody] It doesn't exactly fill me with pride  To see our children playing genocide  Oh friends don't you know  That this garbage has got to go   Then I come to our old friend, Barbie Doll  She's rich, tall, and blond, her boobs are big the girl she's got it all  And twelve year old girls will puke up their dinner  As they keep trying to get thinner and thinner  Oh friends don't you know  That this garbage has got to go   Next is a twelve inch action figure of a soldier from the Vietnam War  With a cloth uniform and all the gear, who could ask for more?  There are no toys of the dead and the lame  They make war look like&nbsp;some exciting game  Oh friends don't you know  That this garbage has got to go   As I ponder all these things my heart is filled with sorrow  Because in the children of today&nbsp;lie the seeds of tomorrow   Until today I had it "this racist garbage," "this sexist garbage," and "this militaristic (warmongering?) garbage." But I think maybe that makes me sound too academic and overstates the point. Hopefully the verses have already demonstrated that racism, sexism, and militarism are the reasons the toys aren't good for kids.

       urlLink C'mon, boy, you need to lighten up  by Joan Ryan.   A&nbsp;funny and poignant&nbsp;take on Arnold's recent comments about the Democrats in the California Legislature.   Here's the first few paragraphs:     In a parallel, pink universe . . .   Enough already about Gov. Arlene Schwarzenegger's remarks over the weekend. She was simply using a little humor to make a point about state legislators who aren't showing the emotional intelligence necessary to find consensus on the budget.   "I call them 'boy-women,' '' she said.   Humorless men's libbers have their boxers all in a bunch, accusing the governor of -- what else? -- sexism. They say using the word "boy'' as a pejorative suggests the governor thinks masculine qualities are somehow funny and inferior to women's qualities. They claim "boy-women'' also suggests that the governor completely dismisses the fact that there is, in fact, a gender other than female in the Legislature.   Please.

      Don't feel like I really have anything interesting I want to say right now. Just an update on what I've been up to. I went to the orientation for my job at TJ Maxx last Thursday (which was interesting--it helps to think of myself as an amateur anthropologist) and learned that I wouldn't have to work until the following Thursday (today). So mom and I headed&nbsp;off the next morning to visit my sister in Salem, OR. This fall&nbsp;she'll be a senior at Willamette University, where I graduated a little over two years ago (my time flies!). I had a good time and got to see a couple of my favorite professors and we went over to the chaplain's house and had dinner with him and his wife.   Today I only went to work for a couple hours of training. It's a new store, opening August 8, so we'll need to get it ready--right now it's empty. I just finished reading Barbara Ehrenreich's book   urlLink Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By In America ,  and really enjoyed it.&nbsp;I think it'll provide some good perspective on the new job.

       urlLink Robert Jensen: What Michael Moore Misses About the Empire   I liked the movie, but I think he raises some good points (and some with which I disagree). I should point out that Moore was very critical of Israel and U.S. military aid to Israel when I saw him speak in Salem, OR. So it's unfair when he writes "It's unclear whether Moore actually backs Israeli crimes and U.S. support for them, or simply doesn't understand the issue."

      My posts seem to come in spurts. Sorry for not posting for a while. No I'm not. If you don't have something to say it's better to not say anything than to say something for the sake of saying something. Right?  Anyhow, I go to orientation for my new job tomorrow at TJ Maxx (a clothing store). I hope it works out. It only pays $6.79, but that's almost twice as much as I made a Lutheran Volunteer (how's that for spin?). I guess they hire more people than they actually need and through people quitting and getting weeded out they get down to the right size. I just hope they keep me.  The plan is to start substitute teaching high school in the fall and to apply for graduate programs. Assuming someone accepts me I'll start fall 2005. I'll keep looking into other options, too.

       urlLink The Lizard Strategy  by Ricardo Levins Morales.  He doesn't explain the title until half-way through:   The following proposal is inspired by the Louisiana governor's race of 1991.  That year the Republican nomination was won by David Duke, the former "Imperial Wizard" of the racist Ku Klux Klan.  Duke's neo-fascist politics galvanized a grassroots opposition.  Duke's opponent was the incumbent; a corrupt, scandal-ridden machine politician.  Governor Edwin Edward's standing was so bad that it was not possible to make a positive case for him.  The opposition chose instead to organize their campaign behind such slogans as "Vote for the Lizard, Not the Wizard," while bumper stickers reading "Vote for the Crook, It's Important," flew off the shelf.  This permitted an ultimately successful campaign that did not stoop to selling a bill of goods to the rank and file voters.  The message was that voting for the incumbent was a tactical choice that did not require promoting illusions about Edwards.

      Thanks to everyone who downloaded my songs last week. While my fantasy of word-of-mouth leading to hundreds of downloads didn't materialize, we still made a good showing.   "Drunken Fratboy" had a total of 26 downloads last week, a 5-way tie for 49th place out of 576 songs in the Contemporary Folk category. Last week's total for all songs was 54 downloads, ranking 24th out of 207 artists in the Contemporary Folk category.  Given that many of the top artists are current and past editors' picks, I'm excited by these results. So, once again thanks for your support and please keep spreading the word about any songs you think people will like. Also, be sure to check out other artists at download.com--you'll find some good free mp3's.

      You know you live too close to your neighbors when you can  hear  your neighbor call the police to report people setting off (illegal) fireworks. He was talking in a normal voice, but our windows are open.  Happy 4th of July. If you're interested in the history of the War of Independence, as opposed to popular mythology, I highly recommend first five chapters in Howard Zinn's  A People's History of the United States . Chapter 4 is the one that deals with the Was of Independence itself, but the first three set the stage by discussing indigenous people, slaves, and poor whites respectively. Chapter 5 covers events immediately following independence. I read  A People's History  the summer before starting college (1998) and recently embarked on a long overdue second reading.

      I've just put up the Mp3 of the Month for July, "The Ballad of Ben Linder" (see right sideboard). I posted  urlLink draft lyrics  back in April. The recording quality is okay but nothing to get excited about. I did an all-in-one take instead of multi-track.  As I  urlLink mentioned before  in early June, I picked this as the mp3 for July because July 19th is the 25th anniversary of the Sandinistas' triumph over the Somoza dictatorship. I'll write more about that later.

      Today I finished  The Bean Trees  by Barbara Kingsolver. It begins with an excellent example of an opening sentence: "I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil sign." It's amazing how she fits so much in there without making it awkward.  Anyhow, I really liked the novel. Partially this is because she's a good writer, but I really liked how she worked in stuff about the Sanctuary Movement (where activists in the 1980's would illegally harbor Central American refugees in their homes and churches so they wouldn't have to go home and be killed by U.S. backed military dictatorships). Two of the characters, Esperanza and Estevan, are from Guatemala City and she does a good job of working in details about Guatemala (as well as about a wide variety of topics, including Arizona geology).

      I'm a slacker and didn't get the  mp3 of the month  up yesterday. But I hope to record and post some new stuff later this month, so that should make up for it. I also decided I might as well archive a couple of the most recent mp3's since I have the space.  I picked this song because I wrote it around this time three years ago. It was the summer before my last year of college at Willamette and I was working as a checker at Carrs (owned by Safeway). I had a lot of unstructured time to myself. In a lot of ways I feel like I'm in a similar space right now.  Lyrics for "Going Away"  I'm going away and I'm never coming back 'cause all you folks won't cut me any slack I'm surrounded by people and no one understands And I'm really sick and tired of putting up with your demands  Chorus: I'm going away o so far away nothing you can say 'cause I'm going away today  I'll be a melancholy hermit, I'll dress only in black I'll move out to the wilderness, I'll go live in a shack What I'll do when I get there I really don't know Maybe I'll write a book like Henry David Thoreau Yeah, seems these days that lots of folks are fond of trying to re-create Walden Pond  Chorus  Out in the woods I'll have no need for money I can live of locus and honey It's not like anyone will miss me of all the girls I've loved not one of them would kiss me I hope by now my listeners realize that all this is nothing but lame rhymes and lies  Chorus: I'd never go away o so far away I'm afraid to run away so I'll just stay here today

I lived in Washington, DC and worked full-time for the  urlLink Nicaragua Network , and then  urlLink Quest for Peace .   Anyhow, part of the program is living in community with other volunteers. My house (Bonhoeffer house) was in the Brookland neighborhood in Northeast, near Catholic University. I had four housemates: Peter, Paul, Becky, and Angeli.  There was a couple in the neighborhood maybe a mile away who rented rooms to young people doing social justice work. One of them, Kate, graduated from college with Angeli and was dating Dan, one of Angeli's best friends. Another, Sarah, was friends (from college) with Amy, who was Paul's girlfriend at the time. So, as we had two connections to the house, it was only natural that we hung out with them pretty regularly.  Was that clear? I think writing up these stories will be a good exercise in writing clearly and concisely, because things can get pretty complicated quickly and you don't want to clutter things up with too many unnecessary details, but you also need to flesh things out enough to make them interesting.

						   I have a lot of small world stories, so I thought it'd be fun to write them up from time to time and post them here to share. I'm thinking of letting other people submit their stories, too.

						   It's been over a month, so I figure a post is long overdue.  Summer of 2002 I was in DC interning for the  urlLink Institute for Policy Studies . One of the other interns, Mike, had to call up a bunch of people in Mexico, and maybe elsewhere in Latin America, to see if they could come to some conference or something. I heard him talking on the phone in Spanish while I was doing work in the intern office (which was generally overcrowded, so I tried to work from home when I could).  That fall I started a year with the  urlLink Lutheran Volunteer Corps  (LVC). In January I started volunteering at the  urlLink DC Employment Justice Center  where another LVCer was working. I did Spanish language intakes at their workers rights clinics. I liked doing some direct service (while I loved my placement  urlLink Quest for Peace , I was doing advocacy work that often felt pretty removed from the people I was trying to help), it was good Spanish practice, and I also had an ulterior motive.  Anyhow, one evening I'm at clinic and I can hear this gringo speaking to a client in Spanish. I can't see him because he's doing the intake in a cubicle. I'm like, I recognize that voice and accent. It was Mike. It was cool to bump into him and see him at clinics and we even did an intake together.  So far it's only a mid-level small world story, if that. Peace and justice people get around and our circles are smaller than they ought to be, so it's only natural that we bump into each other from time to time. But it gets better... You see, Mike went to Williams. I knew a guy in Alaska named Jason C. who went to Williams. In elementary school we were in the same "gifted" program. I moved to California when I was 12, but he was good friends with my two best friends in Alaska, Geoff and Jason S, with whom I kept in touch. I saw him the summer before college when I was visiting my dad (who still lives there). So I ask Mike if he knows him. Williams is a small school and they were the same year, so it's no big surprise that they do. They don't just know each other, they're good friends. They both did crew and rowed together  in the same boat.     And that makes the story worth writing.
