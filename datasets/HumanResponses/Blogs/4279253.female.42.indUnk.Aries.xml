						   We went to Knoebels Grove amusement park today.  Left late, Dave (not I) drove and got up there at about 2.  We went right to the pool and spent most of what Dave has set aside for the day.  This was okay - our dinner was in the cooler - hamburgers with all the fixings, watermelon and dessert.  We ate no lunch - I got hungry and asked Dave how much we have for food.  He said $1.50 - not enough.  So I fished my purse out of our locker and pulled up pocket change - about $8.00 worth.  I got myself a bag of chips and we stayed in the pool area for about 4 hours.  Then we left to eat - hungry.  Dave hadn't taken the stroller into the pool area, so Elizabeth had to be held onto on the way to our car to get those picnic fixings.  She was tired, and wanted booboo.  Dave suggested he run for the car, repark it closer to the tables and I wait at the table with the girls.  He came back about 15 minutes later hauling the cooler chest in the stroller.  On the way up he had turned on the lights for road construction (the law here) and had asked me to remind him to turn them off.  I thought the lights being on was stupid - the day was bright and sunny and lights don't help when the day is already as bright - so I forgot to remind him to turn them off.  Guess what - and you already know.  So, now we need a jump - and have no jumper cables to get one with.  Dave starts the fire in our antique hibachi - dispite the fact I laid some serious cash down on a portable grill for his birthday 2 birthday's ago - and has a hard time getting it going.  I pray - and he gets it going fairly decently.  Then he opens the cooler - no hamburger - none.  And not much cash.  So - I pull out that pocket change and Jenny and I walk back into the park and pick up the cheapest dinner we can find - hotdogs.  We get back - give Dave the hotdogs and I mention how it's good I had it, and not to worry as only 1 thing has gone wrong with this Knoebels trip (we never have completely good luck at Knoebels since the kids came, or since our marriage for that fact - Knoebels was strictly a good dating spot for us).  Dave says 2 things went wrong, and that he didn't want to talk about that second thing.  I start to think he's still mad at being up late last night, when infact what he's talking about (that he hasn't told me about yet) is that dead battery - 1-1/2 hours away from home.  We eat, we do the only thing we have money for (thanks to Dave's packrat behavior, and $3.70 of tickets from old trips), we hit a stand for coffee and 1 (and only 1) cone of cotton candy - and go to the security hut.  Really quickly we are in a service cart heading for our car, and on the road (Knoebels packs their own portable jumper kits).  Guess what - it turned our okay for the most part anyway - the kids had a blast, and so did we - thanks to that new baby area (one of those pool areas that has those funny fountain things) and the small bit of change.  I'm tired.  Elizabeth is asleep.  Dave is falling asleep on the couch and Jenny is trying to copy him.  Goodnight.

						   I went a surfing and came upon a site under "next Blog" that played music and featured weird messages in Microsoft Internet Explorer (my computer is a microsoft) in upper/lower case words while music played.  I couldn't get out of it, so I just had to log out my computer (the messages wanted me to hit that button underneath the weird message) rather than go into one of those weird sites attached to this whole thing.  Anyhow - excuse my lack of knowledge here on computers - some site in this Blogger journal thing looks like it's a virus.  So I logged out, ran my virus protection and I'm good to go (also - I dumped a bunch of cookies).  But somebody needs to do something about this site - delete it maybe - that is acting so weird.  Okay - done.

						   We're off to Knoebels Grove today.  This is Jenny's last monday before school starts and Dave's day off.  Essentially - it is our last chance.  Dave freaked out at the kitchen last night and was up until 3 more or less doing dishes, laundry and etc.  Anyhow - Elizabeth fell asleep on my boo last night (after a day at Hersheypark pushing a stroller I wonder why I just couldn't stay awake) and Dave woke me with his banging around.  He said "go to sleep, you'll be driving" so I'm on the internet getting directions.  I wish I wasn't such a dissappointment to him.  Anyhow - today I drive, and for lack of coffee - I am still shot.  Elizabeth nursed all night, Jenny woke us up.

						   I love to read poetry - but given my age it wasn't cool enough to admit to such a thing when I was young.  Stupid - but I don't know alot of really good poems as a result.  Here's one I just found on a Robert Louis Stevenson site.   Dear Lady, tapping at your door, Some little verses stand, And beg on this auspicious day To come and kiss your hand. Their syllables all counted right Their rhymes each in its place, Like birthday children, at the door They wait to see your face. Rise, lady, rise and let them in; Fresh from the fairy shore, They bring you things you wish to have, Each in its pinafore. For they have been to Wishing-land This morning in the dew, And all your dearest wishes bring -- All granted -- home to you. What these may be, they would not tell, And could not if they would; They take the packets sealed to you As trusty servants should. But there was one that looked like love, And one that smelt like health, And one that had a jingling sound -- I fancy it might be wealth. Ah, well, they are but wishes still; But, lady dear, for you I know that all you wish is kind, I pray it all come true.   It's called "Dear Lady, Tapping at Your Door" by Robert Louis Stevenson.

						   We went to church - and I'd have paid attention to what the preacher said if I hadn't been so upset at my sister Jill.  We went out to lunch at a place called Don's Pier and paid too much for too little.  We went to Hershey Park - where we were treated to a long drawn out argument by Jenny called "why I'm unhappy - because you won't by me any toys here" that lasted 3 hours, when we finally told her we were leaving if she continued her complaints.  She stopped - and we stayed another 2-1/2 hours.  Now - my feet hurt and I'm tired.  We have thin steaks thawing and the kids are getting a bath.  The day was beautiful - but exhausting.  done.

						   Dave has just left for work.  Before he left, before we sat down to eat what I had been making when the fight started - we went into a fight.  He's comparing me to other men's wives.  I feel totally hopeless about this - once they start compairing, you're in trouble.  I told him - after we ate an icy dinner of soft tacos and discord - to let me know when he'd like me to start compairing him to other women's husbands.  He apologized. I hope this gets settled without him walking out on me.  I hope it gets settled without him cheating on me.  But he has to come to the point whereby he no longer puts me up for comparison.  And I don't know when that will be.  I do know he's been doing it for years.   Help.  I need this to stop - because I'll always be able to be topped.  Always.  But I've never done it to him - ever.  Will his love ever be true?

						   I'm having problems relating to Jenny and I really shouldn't be.  We are almost dead on the money similar in personality.  But I've been making mistakes with her - ones I should really not be doing because they wouldn't work on me (though they are what were used on me when I was a kid).  My parents yelled - that's YELLED - and yet I didn't change because of it.  Now - I yell - that's YELL - and go figure - Jenny doesn't even listen.  The instructions said clearly - DON'T GO EMOTIONAL - go logical, and as I recall when my dad finally did go logical (on a job search issue), and lowered his voice and talked true to me - I LISTENED - go figure.  So - why am I using a tactic that didn't work on me on my daughter who is so very similar to me?  Why??????????  Because I didn't know better.  Now I do.  Having problems with your kid.  Check out this link from  urlLink Focus on the Family .  You'll have to sign up, get a number - then go in with that number to take the test.  done.  Now I just have to look at this really really carefully - and make some changes.  bye

						   I went online - I took a test. I came up with these recommendations to follow. I need someplace to copy them as my printer didn't print them out right. Here it is    Recomendation for Jenny  You're doing great! We need just a little more information before we give you a Parenting Action Plan. We would like to make some recommendations based on the information you've given us about yourself and Jenny. The following list of Do's and Don'ts can provide helpful guidelines for effective communication with Jenny. When communicating with Jenny Respect her quiet demeanor. Remember that quality work requires quality instructions. Give reason for a change in rules. Support your ideas with facts. Allow time for her to be alone if she wants. Keep your distance. Allow about three feet between you and her. Take your time. Be relaxed and informal. Allow time for questions. Be prepared. She is not influenced when you present your ideas in a random order. Use the correct buzz words for her age and interest. Follow through on your promises. Use an unemotional approach. Ask "how to" questions. When communicating with Jenny, avoid these things . . . Don't overuse hand or facial questions. Don't yell or scream. This creates tension which will affect what she hears. Don't present your case with shallow ideas. Don't criticize the quality of her work without analyzing the quality of your instructions. Don't overuse authority. Keep communication at the discussion level. Don't be vague. Be specific about instructions and make sure you allow time for questions or clarification. Don't be disorganized in thought or ideas. Don't make statements you cannot prove. Don't stand too close - allow space between you when talking. Don't get overemotional. She is not influenced by emotion. Logic is more important. Don't overwhelm her with compliments. She will feel manipulated if you give too many or fail to be sincere. Don't be giddy, casual, or informal if you're serious about what you want her to hear.    Okay - now there it is.

						   I'm dumping some stuff that had to do with my old journal - as well as some illustrations I used for it that weren't my own, but someone elses and pulled off the internet.  If you see it here - I took it.  Jenny is bugging me to go onto the Barbie internet site and sports news is on.  They just shared a bowl of ramen noodles, leaving the poptarts I put out for them sit.  I'm going to do some knitting today - I have the pieces for Jenny's size 8 red wool sweater almost done.  Canada is apparently going through an early fall - so we'll be going through one too (as the jet stream runs right over our state).  She needs that sweater.  I have soft tacos happening for them later.  Dave didn't get off until 3:30 AM last night so I'm going to let him sleep until about noon.  fini.

						   I just deleted my Bravenet account and now I'm with this blog provider only.  You can't go and have 2 blogs successfully - and I can be more honest in this blog than I could be in my other.  So I carried the blogs I like to read from the journal's links to my toolbar and now I'm gone.  fini.  You don't do this to gain friends - you do this to help handle your own life.  I used my first journal to help handle my own life - but my second carrier was mixed with trying to get acceptance from "the community" - because there were perks to doing this - a little bit of annonymous fame so to speak.  If I wanted fame I'd have tried to be an actress or something - this isn't about getting something like that.  So - now I'm honest about when my day is bad and I'm honest without apology too.  No deletes here.  When my day is good I'll be spending it doing something besides looking at a computer screen typing.  I'll be enjoying it.  But when my kids are making me go nuts - I'll dump those feelings into here.  That's the purpose of keeping a journal.  done.

						   We just had a major thunderstorm go through that lasted a good 2 hours.  We were getting so many strikes that I was sure we'd loose our electricity - and I lit a good 8 candles (in jars or sconce candles on our walls).  Anyhow - the electricity possibly going out caused Jenny fear and in fear she wants to crouch under a blanket - so she starts pulling out sheets to hide under - and Elizabeth follows suit and now I have 2 kids throwing around sheets in a house with 8 candles going and the possibility of loosing our lights.  I flipped.  I yelled.  The thunderstorm is gone, and the kids are settled down watching a Barbie video and Jenny is calling out to me to watch this and that on the video.  I had to pay close attention on what was happening and now I'm just glad it's over.  Elizabeth has been flying into the refrigerator to hide (thank God we have shelves on both sides that keep her from being able to close herself in it) and then wandering off leaving the refrigerator door open.  The light is burned out now.  Jenny pulled out more juice boxes - but I was just too stressed to drink.  Thank God that storm is over - so many strikes - and we didn't even loose out lights. I don't live in Florida - we live in Pennsylvania - and in Pennsylvania just before Charley wracked havoc on the folks down south - we had some tornado scares - touch downs that were relatively close.  No - the second one wasn't like what they are used to in the mid west - but the first one was - and happened about 20 miles away from here.  The second weaker one happened closer.  Anyhow - 2 little kids not listening, candles a necessity, sheets flying, my Elizabeth climbing around our stone fireplace and in the kitchen, Jenny running by the candle in the hall and Elizabeth having to follow suit (like most little sisters do) - I'm just calming down now.  That's why I'm in here. Dave's working overtime likely tonight.  And Elizabeth is showing no signs of slowing down (wish she was - I could use the break).  If the time is off we are looking at 11:05 PM Friday night and Dave shouldn't be home for another 5 hours.  I'll be putting the girls to bed solo as usual - and with a bit more difficulty as I had to yell at them (safety required it) and threaten them (more safety) and they are likely seeing me as a "tiger mama" tonight. I saw some poor soul on TV tonight who has tried to make himself appear as a tiger at the cost of $100,000.00.  The man had a cleft lip put in - a collogen upper lip - an abundance of tattooing on his face and arms - numerous piercings on his face for whisker "earings" to be put in, grew huge long fingernails he sharpens on both sides and sports a mechanical tail.  Get this - he wants more surgery - that would require him to walk on all fours.  What surgeon would do this to such a madman? Okay - well I'm calmed down a bit.  Goodnight.

						   I don't believe in home schooling under normal circumstances - such as having a normal kid in no need of any special education, or them living at home all the time - not moving around etc.  I don't believe in it for the reasons people usually state for homeschooling their kids.  But the school district refusing to send parents information about bussing or their teacher or what time to pick them up from the bus stop or drop them off at the bus stop - I think now is one really really good reason to homeschool.   to homeschool - one must need a kid in need of special attention at home and be lacking in those qualities kids usually consider "friendship" worthy.  to homeschool - one must be having to deal with the worst possible school principal or teacher - a Nazi principal - a warden teacher - or the most idiotic school staff possible - an "animal house" set of idiots running the place.   Can you tell I'm just a little upset at the lack of information our school district has seen fit to pass along to me - at this late date - school for us starting in only a little over a week?

						    and time to play on the computer doing things I shouldn't to find out if I can.  Nothing illegal, nothing immoral - just stuff that might make this journaling burp.  I'm still learning stuff about this new blog system - bear with me.  to go color I hit this color thing  and type with   a different   color -   cool.  To link to another journal or anything else   first I go back to black then I type a word - such as  urlLink Grandpa Chuck  then I hit that link thing writting down the link's address before I hit the link thing but I highlight the word first and voila - I get a hyperlink (catch that - I'm hyperlinking now - coooool) and on this journal too.  I already know I can't insert pictures into a single entry with text - and maybe that has it's plusses.  What happens if I hit one of those funny looking things here I get a billet style with either numbers or dots.     Now when I hit that parenthesis thing I get another indentation.  hit the italics thing and I go italics  hit the bold additionally and I go bold italics.  Hit the straight edge line thing and this lines up for me.    Send it all back the way it's supposed to be and I almost go normal.  let's hit enter

						   Because I don't know how to use this yet.  Can you do posts with pictures incorporated into them - or do the pictures have to be done seperately?  Obviously - for this one - seperately.  Dave's out with the kids in the kiddy pool.  I have tarragon chicken in the oven.  I still haven't had any coffee - IN MY BRAND NEW COFFEEMAKER!.  Yes - that's right - my BRAND NEW COFFEEMAKER!.  So stupid.  Time to end post.

						   Had something in it more than Dave's saying.  All he's admitted to is 2 recorders and 1 tuning instrument, plus some guitar strings.  Guitar strings . . . the wheels are turning . . . but I found no guitar downstairs.  I did however find Dave's old guitar case . . . did he just get a new case?  I have my tarragon chicken in the oven, Dave has the kids out in the pool . . . Okay - this is too weird.  I thought I lost this when I added that picture.  Move on time now.

						   Dave is off getting me my new coffeemaker - to replace the one that died after only 2 weeks of use.  Jenny and Elizabeth are eating their lunch of silly spagetti (ramen noodles) because the macaroni and cheese Dave picked out for them was buggy (yuck).  I'm online trying to pull up stuff for some fairs Dave wants us to go to (hate that Bloomsburg one - yuck) and I am hanging on waiting for him to get home with my new coffeemaker so I can make some and so that we can eat our lunch of hot wings (yum).  The ups guy just dropped something off for Dave - from Musician's Friend - and it's in a huge box (a huge guitar carrier sized box - huuuum?) and I'm just a little upset because we already have 3 guitars (3!). I'm glad to have found this - from that crochet girl who keeps one (Kariholtz) - because I can type into it without Jill having a clue as to this.  Jill is my sister.  Don't keep a blog with the same carrier as your sister.  Those sibling rivelries continue into adulthood.  Just don't. Okay - about me.  I'm married for almost 10 years to a man with the post office, I'm a SAHM with 2 kids - daughters aged 2 and 6.  Dave's home - time to eat, see my new coffeemaker and most importantly - see what's in that great big box!
