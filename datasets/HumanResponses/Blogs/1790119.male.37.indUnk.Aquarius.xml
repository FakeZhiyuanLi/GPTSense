						   Quote from a jammajampa blog reader. "(Eric)...don't you think that the car (STi) is a bit suped up ..i know what you're thinking...it can't ever get too suped up.. but it is starting to look a bit ghetto...i mean that in the  nicest way..."   Several folks who are also "not in the know" have commented similarly. Saying this car is Fast&Furious, Low rider ...and on and on.   I'm not insulted...but rather my mission is to now help educate the masses regarding this cars true purpose.   it this .... urlLink Tommi in action at Swedish Rallye  ..as opposed to this.... urlLink Neon nonsense   Next stop...

						   Busy fathers day . Got chocolate croissants in bed... (as did the kids). Got to clean leaves etal off the roof. and go to the O's game with Logan (They won but we only lasted 3 innings). Fun anyway. Logan wanted bball cards for his "Vinder" ..maybe he grew tired of all the pokemon cards..NOT ! Took the scooby and tried to varying the speed the whole way. ..put on close to 100 miles..   We're reading mythological tales and Logan told Kate all about Pegasus and the constellations..We did the planitarium like last year and he remembered out of the blue! kid is a genuis. Jay is battling Logan for attention while also being his shadow. Logan says, "lets go marching".. Jay repeats him, "yeah! le go machin" .. Just in case you did hear.

						   well im still traveling...now in FL.   CT was "fun", although it could have been better if Kate was feeling 100% (strep throat) and myself (who knows what I have apart from coughing up a lung every now and then.) Kate has quickly adopted a NY attitude. Wonder how long it'll last?   Central FL is like the midwest...only hotter. I sucked big time in golf today. Scramble play. At least there was one person in our foursome even worse. We still finished our round 4 under par.. I just thought I was better than how I actually played.  Thats all for now

						   So the house is now on the market ..sign in ground.. etal..  Fingers are crossed that we get truly good offers.   Oh well.. even if we dont, we've fixed the house up pretty damn good. Logan let the cat-out-of-the-bag last weekend when he told Whitten who then told Jesse. I think that was relief to Kate so she could then tell everyone before they actually saw the sign in the ground!    Logan's latest is wanting me to buy Yu Gi OH cards off ebay. The rare ones (Slifer the Sky Dragon, Obelisk the Tormentor, and The Winged Dragon of Ra) are $80 bucks!! He's gonna be saving his money for a while.      Jay has been singing a cool song about the bad weather.. "Rain rain go away, come again another day" Adorable.

						   I am testing the new Google 2.0 beta which includes ad-blocking. Also has a new blog this feature. I'll let you know how it works.  I'm helping organize an event for a dozen or so STI owners in the WDC/VA/DC area. We are doing a leisurely drive around the region. The idea is to show off and talk to each other about the cars and also help burn off some of the break in miles (1000 total). Personally, I'm already at 640 miles... so this works great. Its nothing that a few hour drive can't take care of!      We have about 14 folks ready to go. If you or you know of anyone else who is interested feel free to follow the latest news and develops regarding when/where/what at the North American Subaru Owners Club forum string   urlLink    Cheers Eric

						   OK.  Two things. Very funny  K and I are doing the "get the kids ready for bed ritual" and it seems everyone, even K, are stalling! (Truth be told, it’s only just past 8:00pm but now getting into my veg-out time). L starts saying he's hungry. 2nd dinner. Also wants a double "boys club" (his term for pre-bedtime play session with toys) and J is trying to be very, very still, snuggling on K's lap, hoping I don’t see him. Even K is not making any motion towards the stairs.   OK, I've already said bedtime like 5 times, so I start up the stairs saying that unless folks start moving there will be no snack, no double "boys club", no stories etc, etc, etc. So L reluctantly runs past me and starts up the stairs as I grumble, "no pays attention to me, what am I invisible". So L says, "no dad you're chopped liver".  I laugh for 5 minutes. Then he says, "but dad. What IS chopped liver?"  Next story. Same night. K and I get into a pissing match regarding whether we drive an hour to get a better view of Mars on Wednesday night. We then make nice and its already time for us to sleep. I'm brushing my teeth and K start positioning me, turning the lights out, to see out of the bathroom skylight at Mars (or what appears to be through the dirty skylight a glowing street light). She then heads downstairs and out the front door (west side) to get a better vantage point. I turn the lights back on, finish brushing my teeth and head out the door too. K is in the street looking up and I reluctantly make my way barefoot across the walkway and, the driveway and then into the street also. I catch our neighbor, Hiel (pronounced "Hi al"...yes that is his name) taking their dog inside. K and I ponder the sky for a few more minutes and believe we see Mars. Looks like a bright star to me. (I had expected to see a glowing red ball of flames.)  I am now complaining that the bugs are eating me alive so I dart across the yard into the house as does Kate and we walk up the stairs to finish our bedtime beauty rituals. It is now about 11:00pm.  Then the phone rings.   Now calls that happen after 9:00pm are considered an annoyance. Usually friends/family with bad etiquette.  On the other hand, calls after 10, one starts thinking that something bad has happened somewhere, somehow and you don’t want to answer it out of fear of what has happened but of course you have to.  After 11, whatever has happened has got to be even worse!  “Hello” I muster in a mock curious, lets-be-strong-about-this voice. It’s Jessie, Hiel’s wife. Immediately she starts apologizing for calling so late but Hiel was taking the dog in and saw a “person in the street  IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE! ” After figuring out what he meant, she didn’t believe Hiel so Jessie had a look for herself out of the window. Only she saw  TWO PEOPLE IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE AND THEN THEY STARTED RUNNING TOWARD OUR HOUSE!  Should she call us or not asking Hiel who said that it’s probably someone staying with us and we won’t care and if it wasn’t, we would DEFINITELY want to know. I cut her off and calm her nerves explaining what K and I had been doing and thanked her for her vigilance.  K and I had a good laugh

						   Went to Aunt Laurel's with Kate and Jay last weekend for dinner. Was great fun particularly Jay getting to play with all their wildlife pets..bunny, frogs and a turtle they found that day crossing the road in Potomac MD. Jay would not leave until Aunt Laurel offered that we take it home and keep it but only as long as it eats. Otherwise, we had to let it go. Kate pushed I reluctantly agreed. hey let the kids have some fun. We then picked Logan up from his "almost sleepover" party with a bunch of girls. Only 6 six yrs old. If only he knew better. We surprised him at home .. First question.."was it real?" promptly joined by man that is SO COOL!! A REAL TURTLE!! The Turtle was them tormented by our kids latter joined by the neighbors kids for 24 hours...until Kate and I proclaimed that Shelby (the turtle's new name.. full name Shelby Tinkerbell ..girl turtle) would have to be set free .. Least she starve in our possession or worse get dropped or driven over by a hyped up 2.5 year old on a big wheel. Jay's gripped or driving skills none too steady. So we did what all families do. We branded Shelby with an "S" (permanent marker) "a la Marlin Perkins Wild Kingdom style; took pictures and set her free into the wild (well neighborhood park).     Documented below

						    challenging. I think DC needs something like this..   The Fools of Golf  Thomas Jackson, 09.15.03    In urban golf's premier event, the Emperor Norton Open turns the streets of San Francisco into a killer 9-hole course.  The par-3 third hole of the North Beach golf course tees off from the top step of a concrete staircase on Jones Street. The alleyway below--the fairway, that is--is littered with hazards as confoundingly placed as the pot bunkers on the 12th hole at St. Andrews. They include a Mercedes convertible (roof up), a blue Audi, a cluster of motorcycles and a white pickup truck. Just beyond those impediments, the fairway doglegs to the right--although the alley continues toward bustling Columbus Avenue--and into the small parking area of a swing-dancing joint called Bimbo's 365. The pin is against the near wall, guarded by decorative shrubs.   David Calkins, a.k.a. Tiger Streets, swaggers up to the tee with a 3-iron. To birdie, he'll have to slice the ball sharply around that dogleg. Or he could try to ricochet off of the Mercedes' driver-side door, which would bounce the ball right into Bimbo's lot. The gallery hushes as he assumes the position. He eases the club back, cries "Incoming!" then takes a home-run swing that nearly sweeps his feet from beneath him. All eyes scan the horizon for the ball, which is surely twisting through space on a perfect fading slice.   Actually, it's still there on the top step, nudged a few inches by the whoosh of the passing club.   Rick "Big Shooter" Abruzzo has a more sensible approach. Using a putter, he gives the ball a mere kiss, letting gravity bounce it down the stairs and slowly toward the dogleg. All goes well until a pebble, or perhaps a bottle cap, sends the ball skittering into the swale where the motorbikes are parked.   D.J. Skillman, meanwhile, has wisely chosen to shoot with a sand wedge. If he can put enough English on the ball, it should drop like a dead bird where the fairway crooks. He executes his preshot routine, which consists of a giant swig of Budweiser, then takes his cut. The ball leaps up and skips along the air, over the cars and well past the turnoff. It nearly ends up beneath the trucks roaring up the avenue. "Oh, yes," cries Skillman, as he bounds down the stairs after it.   This is not, of course, the way the Royal and Ancient game is meant to be played. Golf happens on bosky hills and windy seashores, not blacktops and back alleys. But then, the R&A has no affiliation with this tournament. Nor does the U.S.G.A. or the World Minigolf Sport Federation, for that matter. No, the sponsor of today's event is an obscure union of renegade linkspeople called the Urban Golf Association. Today they're staging the 3rd annual Emperor Norton Open, a tournament played on a preset 9-hole course that wends its way through San Francisco from North Beach to Fisherman's Wharf.   The U.G.A.'s ringleaders are core members of the Cacophony Society, a loosely knit, apolitical band of "culture jammers" that's been making mischief in and around San Francisco since 1986. Most famously, its early members played an instrumental role in the Burning Man festival's explosive growth from an intimate effigy-torching party in the late 1980s to the 28,000-person extravaganza it is today. The group's other activities ebbed in the 1990s, but in recent years a new generation has unleashed a fresh wave of silliness on the Bay City. In 2000, Calkins, Abruzzo and others staged a barbecue in Union Square promoting feral pigeons as a renewable food source. Members donned chef's uniforms, fired up grills and passed off precooked squab as pigeon meat, while others chased birds around the park with butterfly nets. "We were poking fun at the city in general," reminisces Calkins, but also "the pigeon population and, of course, PETA." In the annual Salmon Run, they masquerade as fish and sprint San Francisco's yearly Bay to Breakers road race--in the wrong direction. Wackiest of all is the Urban Iditarod, when Cacophonites dress up as dogs and harness themselves to shopping carts--each manned by a musher--and race a hilly, 3.4-mile course through Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach and Fisherman's Wharf.   As is the society's custom, the local authorities have not been officially notified about today's event. But that's OK. "Generally when there's a big crowd of stupidity," says Calkins, "they know it's us." And they certainly don't mind when at noon about 80 U.G.A. members and assorted tag-alongs convene in a loud and disorderly manner beneath the Ben Franklin statue in Washington Square Park. Judging from the golfers' mock-Scottish attire, they've just ripped through the secondhand shops in the Mission District. One duffer is wearing a yellow-and-white striped shirt, a red paisley tie, knickers, purple and lime-green argyle socks and a tweed cap. Another is sporting striped clown pants with two-toned wingtips and a leopard-skin brimmed red cloche. A young woman called Sandwichgirl is wearing a yellow, green and red polyester tartan suit and a gob hat with a wind vane mounted on top. Calkins and Abruzzo, both among the U.G.A.'s founding members, look comparatively straitlaced in their green Masters jackets, complete with embroidered crests.   Most players are making do with a single club. The 3-iron is a popular choice, as it can, in principle, be used for both driving and putting. But I also see a polo mallet and a lacrosse stick. Brooms and croquet mallets are popular, and legend has it that one year someone played with a sledgehammer. Sandwichgirl has a giant driver, custom-made from papier-mâché, that breaks the U.S.G.A.'s club head size limit by about 10,000 cubic centimeters. There's even a rumor--St. Andrew help us--that one golfer is working with a paper towel roll. As for the ball, the U.G.A. provides a foam, "lawsuit-proof" variety roughly the size of a tangerine. Now the standard for urban golf, these balls were first used primarily as therapeutic squeezy toys for carpal tunnel sufferers.   Shunning the rules of tournament stroke play, the golfers set out in "heats" of 10 to 15 players each. I join the first wave, which includes Calkins, Abruzzo, Skillman and others, as well as a crew from Channel 5 news. Hole 1 is little more than a warm-up, an easy par 3 across the park's lawn. Hole 2, on the other hand, is as heartbreaking as the aforementioned 3rd. It plays down a fenced-in, switchbacking stairwell and onto the blacktopped North Beach Playground. Hazards include anti-moped poles and children. On the par-3 4th, played on the Mason turnaround, moving cable cars clog the fairway and a red-faced station manager shakes his fist and yells, "You have no business here! Get out of here!" The 6th hole cuts through an outdoor art fair in a park called the Median. "Don't tell me you're actually going to golf here," groans one of the vendors. She shakes her head indignantly, but registers no surprise at the appearance of the ten-somes.

						    Tidbit from Kate..  I just read from one of Kelly's emails that a dragon fly only has a lifespan of 24 hours.  Must not be used for deep cover ops.   Think you know everything...?    A dime has 118 ridges around the edge.    A cat has 32 muscles in each ear.    A crocodile cannot stick out its tongue.    A dragonfly has a life span of 24 hours.    A goldfish has a memory span of three seconds.    A "jiffy" is an actual unit of time for 1/100th of a second.    A shark is the only fish that can blink with both eyes.    A snail can sleep for three years.    Al Capone's business card said he was a used furniture dealer.    All 50 states are listed across the top of the Lincoln Memorial on the back of the $5 bill.  An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.    Babies are born without kneecaps. They don't appear until the child reaches 2 to 6 years of age.    Butterflies taste with their feet.    Cats have over one hundred vocal sounds. Dogs only have about 10.    "Dreamt" is the only English word that ends in the letters "mt".    February 1865 is the only month in recorded history not to have a full moon.    In the last 4,000 years, no new animals have been domesticated.    If the population of China walked past you, in single file, the line would never end because of the rate of reproduction.    If you are an average American, in your whole life, you will spend an average of 6 months waiting at red lights.    It's impossible to sneeze with your eyes open.     Leonardo Da Vinci invented the scissors.     Maine is the only state whose name is just one syllable.     No word in the English language rhymes with month, orange, silver, or purple     On a Canadian two dollar bill, the flag flying over the Parliament building is an American flag.     Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing.     Peanuts are one of the ingredients of dynamite.     Rubber bands last longer when refrigerated.

						   I've created a new blog called  urlLink  autoonthebrain   As soon as blogger (google?) allows me to upgrade to pro, I'll be taking the ads off and added photos etal..    JammaJammpa will still continue to be THE HOT SOURCE for what's up with mi familia and the general state of my mind.  That said..  The move is complete!! (Well almost.. as we still have a few items in the old house that need to be donated and I still need to "lift" things). The walk thru for the new owners is at the weeks end sooo then is the end...  My gloots (spelling?) are killin me. Used the in-laws SUV (or SMV..sport minivan vehicle... or scratch that.. its a damn Buick.. and a Rendezvous no less.. What does that mean? some sort of risqué meeting for the sad and bored suburban couples looking for some love-life spice? Lets just called it a friggin minivan) Anyway I put on over 60 miles on the thing from Friday night to Sunday. Doesn’t seem like much but lets do a little math and then you can "feel my pain"   Distance to the new house is about 2 miles (one way) so that 15 trips (back and forth) loading and unloading boxes, clothes and whatever miscellaneous shit we've been accumulating for about 9 years (scratch that... lets just say 36 years! as we have stuff given to us when we were born!!)   Now the new more expensive but smaller house has everything spewing everywhere.. At least cable is up and I have a clear view to the TV..

						   Got the keys to the new house ..now the fun stuff..THE MOVE! When folks ask me, I explain that we will be doing the move over the course of 2 1/2 weeks and can be "lesuirely". Everyone nods in agreement..sometimes envy. Still, internally I question if stretching the move out is mere procrastination on my part and, similar to band-aid removal, should be done fast, in one swift stroke.  Who knows? I'll decide later...  This un-PC "list" has been making the email rounds. Its a good chuckle..perpetuates the ugly male stereotype.. but stereotypes are always based on someone at sometime adhereing to the model, right?!   Men's Rules:  We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side. These are our rules! Please note... these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE!    1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down.   1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.   1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way.   1. Crying is blackmail.   1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it!   1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.   1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.   1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.   1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days.   1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.   1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us.   1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.   1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself.   1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.   1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we.   1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is.   1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that.   1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle.   1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.   1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really.   1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks.   1. You have enough clothes.    1. You have too many shoes.   1. I am in shape. Round is a shape.   1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

						   I was trying to locate the Best Buy Credit card account login online and new that it is HouseHold bank (HRS) that they use as a financial institution. First listing under google was the following site  http://bestbuycard.net  which as it turns out is "consumer complaint site" that has the answers to ALL your questions:  Trying to pay your Best Buy Retail Services bill online?    We have the latest information    Can't find the HRS payment site or phone number   We have the latest listings    Is your interest coming due on a "no interest" plan   Sorry - they didn't tell you about this, huh?    Just learned you can't make a payment at Best Buy?   Sorry - it's not like most stores, it's Household    You just got burnt and now you are researching   Sorry - but you are in the right place    Do you need to do something soon so you don't get hurt?    We are a research group not affiliated in any way with Best Buy or Household.   Ok great they have all this info but nowhere on the site can I find these answers. Seems kinda wacky and it my cynical mindset potentially a scam. It urns out that two pages into a google search for the real site its there. So as a service to all those would be Best Buy card customers here it is..   "https://www.hrsaccount.com/hrs/ecare?cmd_Redirect=LoginJSP&org=169">  hope it saves you some time

						   Little tidbits..  Jay's latest: He learned to say the word  "poopie"  as a joke. He calls someone  "poopie"  and thinks its funny. We'll, he has been told that this is rude and that it is NOT allowed unless he is referencing it when he is going to the bathroom.   Jay has been quite cognizant of not speaking this word..so much that when he even THINKS about saying it, he catches himself (..really..you can actually see him stop himself) and says, (very seriously), "I'm not going to say  poopie ." Then he informs me,  "That (poopie) is rude".  Only when he says "rude" it sounds like "word", so the it sounds like he is saying,  "I'm not going to say poopie. That is a word" . Very funny.

						   Just got the pics back from CVS last night (had used "old" regular camera film.  Hey, it's all that was handy). I needed the pictures to properly tell the story.  Our Thanksgiving started with one fiasco.  Rushing out of the house...getting the kids in the car...getting our side dish for the meal in the car... moving "donateable's" back in the detached garage because they wouldn’t fit in the car....; I then turn to Kate as I sit in the car dreading the answer, "do you have the keys?" I am dreading this answer because I vaguely recall Kate asking me after I was outside and she was closing the door, "do you have the keys". I'm not sure if I answered and if I did, I said "yeah" half paying attention because I truly believed I remembered taking them with my wallet and phone out of kitchen cubby holder. Well,  back to her answer in the car, "NO! I asked YOU if you had them and you said YES! Where are they?!" After futilely searching the back of the car and the garage I know, deep down in my heart, that they are in the house on the kitchen counter even though Kate is saying she checked the counters and they were clear. After 5 minutes, which seemed like an eternity (evil looks and all from family), I realize I've got to break into the house.   OK which window is it gonna be... I make a vain attempt to unscrew a back patio window from the outside and, of course, no dice. If it were that easy anyone could just break in, right?! So I grab a hammer and screwdriver from the garage and proceed to break a window. Once inside, the keys are, as I suspected, on the kitchen counter top next to the fridge left there when I took the side dishes out to load the car.   Moral of the story: 1) Listen to your wife and don't just answer "yes", 2) Don't always try and multi-task. Several trips to car is ok and 3) Always have a spare set of keys.  We'll we were off to the in-laws .. late.. and I'm thinking that I get the absent-minded award for the day, subject to jab and jars from family members for the rest of the Thanksgiving dinner. But this was not the case, so read on...  We are the last to arrive. Brother in law, sister in law and nephew have already arrived. The turkey is well underway and cooking but not done as had previously been planned. Only there is a tremendous amount of smoke billowing from the kitchen.     (Here’s a little background: On one of our last family dinner occasions at the in-laws, potatoes, sprayed with Cisco, where being cooked in the oven. Apparently this spray burns and then smokes.) With this in mind, smoke coming from the oven is considered annoying but a “normal” design flaw with the oven. (Only we didn’t put our heads together to realize that Crisco was not on the Turkey!) As the turkey was nearing completion, Jim (dad in-law..only one in the kitchen) opens the oven and yells, “ we’ve got a fire!” Joel and I are in the next room watching football and run into the kitchen. Sure enough there’s a grease fire in the wall oven because the cooking pan has a hole and the fire is now engulfing the turkey! We start throwing flour into the oven and it seems like its going out. Jim calls 911.   By now the smoke is quite dense in the kitchen, Joel has attempted to turn off the oven circuit breaker tripping the circuit that says “range” but apparently they are not labeled correctly because the cooking timer on the oven is still on. Someone then gets the bright idea that we should get out of the house..  But not Jim.  911 had instructed him to stay on the line due to the fact that someone was having trouble breathing. It turns out that someone was Jim and only because he doesn’t have a cordless phone and 911 instructed him to stay on the line which is, of course, in the smoke filled kitchen!)  Joel and I tell Kate, Kelly, Carole and the boys that we should leave the house and that the fire department is coming. They look at us like we’re joking. We reiterate that the kitchen is filled with smoke. Someone looks for herself and then everyone gets the message.  We start locating the kid’s shoes while not panicking but you’ve got to yell to get the attention of those boys..so they hear the yelling and start to panic. We easily calm them down in the front yard and know everyone is excited but also dreading the arrival of the emergency crews.    Must have been a slow day because they sent 2 engines, 2 ambulances and the battalion chief also showed up (albeit briefly).   All the neighbors now start coming out of the woodwork as the sirens are blaring and the lights flashing. Jim comes out of the house.. pants covered in flour looking mortified.   They doused the oven with an extinguisher and then brought out a monster portable fan to suck all the smoke out. We joked with them for a bit, took pictures and offered them pie (which they humbly refused.. apparently they have tons at the fire house) As it turns out Jim had just last week come to the aid of the neighbor across the street when her alarm was going off.   The source of the alarm couldn’t be found so they called 911.   I guess it was some of the same crew that came during our thanksgiving day excitement because when they turned down Carle’s pie offer, Carole said they should come back to get some if they run out. They replied, “ right. We know where YOU live!”  Taking the crown from me is....     urlLink Here come the troops   urlLink They've arrived   urlLink Second engine..just in case   urlLink And the 1st EMT arrives   urlLink Why not another EMT as well as the Chief!   urlLink Father of the house..pissed!   urlLink Father of the house..in their hands now   urlLink Logan and fire truck   urlLink Jay and the 2nd fire truck   urlLink What a nice back-drop for playing   urlLink Your standard Kelly, Joel, Carole holiday pic   urlLink Who wants pie and waiting for smoke to clear   urlLink Ready to eat..

						   "...Placing an irate call to CBS over Janet Jackson's Super Bowl stunt didn't cut it for Terri Carlin. The Tennessee native felt the need to share her two cents on a larger scale, filing a class action lawsuit over the flashdance.   Now, less than a week after the Tennessee woman filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Jackson, Justin Timberlake, MTV, CBS and Viacom, she's withdrawn the suit that sought billions in damages.   Last Wednesday, the outraged Knoxville banker claimed the nipple slip caused her and "all Americans who watched the Super Bowlto suffer outrage, anger, embarrassment and serious injury."   No word on the nature of the injuries caused as a result of the "wardrobe malfunction," though speculation among talk show hosts have leaned toward whiplash, suffered during Jackson's breast baring.   Earlier, Carlin seemed unswayed by apologies from Jackson and denials from the networks and Timberlake that they had any prior knowledge of the revealing stunt. Indeed, she accused CBS of not having a "sufficient broadcast delay" in place to prevent unexpected mishaps like Boobgate 2004.   Fast forward to this week and Carlin has filed a notice of dismissal in federal court. Though as self-appointed boob patrol bully she plans to remain vigilant, watching to see if "remedial measures" announced by the networks and the FCC (news - web sites) succeed in preventing similar scandals."   urlLink See full story here

						   Date: Tue, 3 Feb 2004 08:05:00 -0800 (PST)  From:  "Andrew Boltax"    Add to Address Book  Subject: Re: Janet Jackson's breast  To: "Eric Nesson"       Did you read the coverage of the breast incident in today's paper? Man, people are all worked up over this. It's pretty funny.  Maybe not LOL funny, but funny nonetheless.  ---------------------------------------------------- Yeah I did and was like WTF!    Yes it was planned. (She wore an emerald pasty and a removable clothing patch for god sake!) Yes MTV and the NFL new what they were in store for. Just read all the pre-show hype.   But so what. It’s a breast!    Yeah so 2 to 6 year olds saw it but should we really make our children so completely neurotic and effected by nudity? Made parents uncomfortable. These are the same parents who can't control their kids because they forgot to actually talk to them. (Gee maybe the government will do it for me!) Rest assured, the Europeans are laughing at us (again).  And really who cares what China thinks? They were probably more offended by the fart commercials and erection pill pushing!     Clearly the FCC has nothing to do with themselves. "Swift judgment to all involved" investigation?! What is this breast-gate?!"    And who the hell WAS SO OFFENDED BY THE WHOLE HALF-TIME SHOW? F*cking puritans. Hypocrites. Yeah right. Some beer swilling fat slob hasn't seen this before.      I tell you what happen. There was like 50 very repressed football-loving folks out there that didn’t want to watch (but of course couldn’t tear themselves away from there TVs) those horrible music stars. When they saw THE BREAST, some repressed memory from their childhood (when their mommies didn’t feed them enough or they didn’t get enough love’n) was triggered. They called and called and called (trying to get relief..which they can't.. unless they have sex..which they can't because of their "issues"). Then the fun starts. Everyone needs to be holier than though. So the finger pointing begins.         I hate hypocrisy and this one smacks to high heaven of it.      Of course the kicker (no pun)..Wasn't this super bowl one of the highest rated in NFL history?   But that’s just my opinion. I could be wrong..

						   If anyone is waiting..found this on the A&E discussion board.  Sounds reasonable   "Yes, MI-5 aka Spooks, is returning in the fall to A&E. A&E holds the U.S. broadcast rights to the show. From the BBC, A&E bought the right to hack the originial show (Spooks) into bits, insert commercials and oodles of inane graphics. And yet, we watch! MI-5 is just that good.  BBC America can't air the shows because A&E has the rights to them. As for when they'll air Series III or Season 3 or whatever...BBC will air Spooks in the early fall and then A&E will follow 6-8 weeks later with MI-5. All 10 episodes are scheduled to air...we think. That is all we know because A&E isn't talking. Apparently it's a big ol' secret and no one will know it's coming back until it creeps up on us.   This new-fangled thing called Advertising or Marketing, or simply ANNOUNCING A RETURN DATE is far too complicated for the folks at A&E but we will persist in checking and reading BBC news to get the A&E news."

By jumping into the fray with a new approach (read: virtually unlimited storage)it has changed the capacity "ceiling" approach set by other free mail services (yahoo and Hotmail). Its also forced them to adopt a cleaner simplier layout approach.  urlLink Google  is where its at.   If you want me to get you a gmail account during this "beta" period let me know.   - Eman
