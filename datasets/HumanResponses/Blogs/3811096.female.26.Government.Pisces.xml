        ...tears came flowing unendlessly...fears covering my humanity...IS THIS THE LIFE I HAVE TO PAY?  ...it's just an ordinary thursday morning.  everything was set in order--go to work, go to gym, doing some chores for my angels...simple outline for the week.  But one ring can change everything...a call from a very dear person...coffee in the afternoon...hard to cut the moments...dining in a fine resto...shopping spree...all plans has been wrecked with just ONE CALL...no regrets though, but what is the package behind the pleasure of being with him?...he brought me home late...that would be fine, foods for kids are individually packed...pasalubong are really mouthwatering...but, the first angel is somewhat quite...finding she's not feeling well...then the agony continues...  DONT PUT ME IN THIS TEST...

      Catching Rainbows                  If I could catch a rainbow  I would do it just for you  And share with you its beauty  On the days you're feeling blue   If I could build a mountain  You could call your very own  A place to find serenity  A place to be alone   If I could take your troubles  I would toss them in the sea  But all these things  I'm finding are impossible for me   I cannot build a mountain  Or catch a rainbow fair  But let me be what I know best  A friend that's always there   This is a Hug Certificate!!
