      i havent done anything here in such a loooonnnnnngg time....  anyways, here's a day in the life of jason's kid/ ricecake/ chee/ etc....  9:00am- alarm clock rings annoyingly. turns it off, falls asleep  10:00am- is awakened to grandparents yelling for me to get up.  10:45am- Grudgingly complies.  11:00am- falls asleep drinking milk.  11:05am- mops up spilled milk.  12:30pm- turns down offer from grandparents to eat lunch "together because the weather is so nice".  1:00pm- enters internet cafe.  1:01-4:30pm- does "stuff" in cafe.  5:00pm- grab cafe latte, head to bookstore.  6:30pm- food.  8:00pm- laughs his ass off watching reruns of "That 70's Show".  9:00-10:30pm- meaningless channel surfing.  10:30pm- Jayyyyyy Leno!  12:00am- Davidddd Letterman!  1:00am- eats a packet of stale saltines and a glass of grape juice.  1:30-2:00am- get yelled at by grand dad for being up.  2:30am- the bliss of sleep......     (sad thing is, i didnt make this up.)
