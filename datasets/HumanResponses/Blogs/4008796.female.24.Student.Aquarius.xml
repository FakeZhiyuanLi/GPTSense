       everywhere you look you can always find some new place on the internet to put more of your stuff. i'm trying to spread myself around so here i am putting more of what i have out for what will probably be only a handful of people.

       i am laying in bed, trying to sleep, when at 3am i hear an annoying sound coming from outside. at 3am you would hope it would be a passing noise, so that you can return to sleep, but of course as is in most cases for me, its not a passing noise, it is my neighbor(s) playing music through an open car door. did they not know it was 3am? Probably not, considering they were probably drunk, but does that mean they get excused from being responsible for their rude behavior.   i have many things that drive me crazy. people who talk in a movie theater (i dont care if its before the movie has started either. i pay to see the previews too, i should be allowed to hear them), people who actually dont turn off their phones in a theater and arent even embarrassed when they ring right in the middle of the movie. some have even answered their phone. do you really need to answer it to tell the caller that you are in a movie? you should feel bad enough that you interrupted the movie. click it off and they can call you back later. i'm also quite annoyed with people who leave shopping carts in the parking lots, in empty parking spots instead of walking them 2 feet to the shopping cart holder thingie. its not like alot of us couldnt use the exercise anyway.

      i have a great need to create. i just need time, motivation, inspiration and probably a bit more talent and experience. i like to pretend i have all of that though.           i dont ever dream of seeing anything i draw, paint or photograph on a wall in a gallery somewhere. i just want someone to walk into my home one day and say "thats really nice, who's the artist" to which i can say "oh I painted that."  of course i dont really paint. to me photography is much easier because theres always something beautiful or interesting to take a picture of, you just have to find it. drawing from the imagination is hard. i dont have much of an imagination.    art   n.  aesthetic work, as painting, sculpture, or music   artless   a.  simple; natural  i like simple and natural....

      i just threw a  dictionary at my cat. its ok though. it was a small dictionary....and he's got quick reflexes. i think i'm just in a grouchy mood. i've had a long week at work, which i didnt enjoy. and of course its obviously called "work" for a reason so i guess i shouldnt expect to enjoy it, but why cant it atleast be tolerable? i've registered for what might possibly (maybe) be my final year in college. i'm taking more classes than the advisor advised, and i'm still gonna have to find a way to make rent every month.  i'm looking at a semester of little sleep and possible no social life. but then again i guess i dont have much of a social life right now, so sleep will be my only true concern emm....i'm tired and grouchy at my cat. he likes to break things.  i think i'll sleep now and babble more later.

       urlLink                Einsteins Riddle    ok, as far as i can tell there is no real proof that einstein actually had anything to do with this "riddle"... but it kept me awake for many hours last night. more hours than i'll admite cause when i finally crawled into bed, i still didnt have the answer. i showed it to a friend of mine who solved it in what i have to assume is a record 30 minutes.  he compared it to solving a puzzle in a zelda game. according to my sister however, technically this isnt a riddle, its a "logic problem" and since i couldnt solve it i must not be very logical. maybe thats a misuse of the word. i dont know. but anyway, its worth giving a try. i'm gonna rest a couple days before i battle it again. i'll get it eventually.  the important thing in the end will be that i solved it, not that it took me 5 days to get to the answer.
