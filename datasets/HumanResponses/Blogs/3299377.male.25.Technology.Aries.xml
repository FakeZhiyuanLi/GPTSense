						   I had the misfortune of watching a truly obnoxious movie this weekend. ‘Hum Tum’ ended up being a mishmash of all things that can possibly go wrong in a movie. The lead couple had no chemistry. The editing was pathetic. The set piece tear jerker scenes were plastic. The timing of the not too pleasant songs was worse than could have been though possible and the ending was…… well lets just say that if you haven’t caught onto the fact that this is a really, really bad movie then you need to have your head examined.  I also watched ‘Day After Tomorrow’ its not great but it isn’t bad either. Roland Emmerich seems to specialize in making movies in which the actors are subordinate to the movie and its setting. Thankfully he then proceeds to save himself a whole load of money by not casting top notch actors. Actually it all makes sense in a skewed sort of way. The movie had its really bad moments but on the whole it did what it set out to do. And that is to wow audiences with effects sequences, which are truly amazing in their sheer scale. Sure the theme is outlandish and very over the top but I wasn’t looking for a National Geographic Documentary anyway. All in all its worth a watch.

						   ‘Hellboy’ I must admit that the trailer had me expecting more than the movie turned out to be. Its not that Hellboy is a bad movie its just that its not the movie it could have been. While Del torro has done a decent job of characterizing the main protagonist the other characters unfortunately do not get the same treatment, which doesn’t leave us with many hooks to attach ourselves to the characters or the movie.  Did I enjoy the movie though? Sure, whats not to like? There’s a big red demon with a stone hand and snappy one-liners, a human fish with ESP, a pretty lady who bursts into flames, a whole bunch of nice Fx and some decent monsters.  The villans though just didn’t come out as dangerous enough and the final battle simply wasn’t apocalyptic enough. Something you sort of expect in a comic book movie.  All in all it’s a fun movie with just a little less bang than I would have hoped for.

						   Does it occur to the piffling moron who goes and blindly votes for A or B that A or B are different in name only. I think the entire populace of India would be better off if we abstained from voting.  I mean look at the farcical affair whose results we were treated to today. Does the average office going middle class person give a hoot either way whether it’s the corrupt BJP buggers or the corrupt Congress buggers ruining this country?   The net result is ruination whether its forced down our throats by ‘the lotus’ or ‘the hand‘ is a piffling triviality which is scarily inconsequential. Which of course brings us back to my initial suggestion of the entire country abstaining. Maybe the sound of wind whistling through empty poll stations will be heard more clearly than our cries.  Surprisingly, as stirring that rather weighty prologue might have been it does not even begin to touch upon the topic which moved me to write. Fortunately or unfortunately we seem (at least in my opinion) to be on our way to welcoming an Ex Italian lady as our next prime minister.  Now you must realize that I have absolutely nothing against Italy or its people I just find it remarkable that at the end of the day the Indian voter is ‘smart’ or ‘stupid’ enough to actually elect a naturalized citizen as the wielder of ‘Supreme Executive Power’ in the country.  I find this amazing fact rather disturbing at best because try as I might to associate this outcome to the glorious magnanimity and wisdom of the average Indian I know that the true reason resides in our own stupidity.  Which, brings me back to my original rant wouldn’t it have been better to simply not vote.  My countrymen still baffle me……   or maybe I baffle my countrymen……

						   I really do. It’s like some sort of irrepressible disease afflicting me. For some reason I cannot really fathom I am drawn to them. Drawn to them? Heck half the times I’ll initiate them even if deep inside I know I’m fighting a loosing battle. At least that way I can lull unsuspecting people into arguments with me.  Most of my friends no longer argue with me. The fact that I relish an argument almost seems to confound them. Since most of them see it as some sort of disagreeable activity to be partaken of reluctantly and ended as soon as possible they find it difficult if not downright impossible to understand how I can actually enjoy it.  Come on people get with the act. Thrust, parry, limber up those linguistic muscles and pump some factual dumbbells. Give your poor brain a workout apart from the 9 to 9 grind we subject it to every day.  …or at least argue with me about it. :-)

						   Every time I see a movie based on the book I feel like crying. Why oh why does Hollywood insist on taking a perfectly good book and creating a visual monstrosity out of it devoid of all soul and emotion. The Harry Potter series of books is a pleasure to read and it pains me to think that children are going to walk away with a stunted intellectually challenged version of what is actually a truly beautiful story.  I realize that it is a near impossible task to compress a 300 page book into a 150 minute motion picture but that is precisely the reason why one must refrain from hackneyed attempts to accomplish it. Peter Jackson took 3 very long movies and came rather close to accomplishing the near impossible in the Lord of the Rings and still critics raged about how he had distorted the books vision. By the same measure Alfonso Cuarón aught to be keel hauled.

						    Its been a hectic weekend. I caused Armageddon, am on my way to becoming a mafia kingpin, watched a spider battle an octopus, dined at the end of the universe and for a brief moment in time owned all of London.  Like I said it’s been a hectic week.   Spidy 2 is surprisingly good. Of course it’s a corny flick with a shallow story and unwanted melodrama best enjoyed with a large bag of cheese popcorn. But who says that’s a bad thing? The Fx are great, the emotional scenes are short and there is more web slinging action than ever before. The movie even elicited a couple of laughs from me which was an unexpected though pleasant bonus.  Played monopoly after a long time and enjoyed it. The fact that I actually won (For the first time in my life) only added to the fun I suppose but it would have been almost as good if I hadn’t. Or so I keep telling myself :-)  Rise of Nations rocks, Thrones and patriots rocks even more. For the first time in any game I have played I can have Delhi as my capital. It sounds silly but somehow since I started playing with ‘Indians’ my defence is a lot grittier :-). Unfortunately I kinda lost count of the number of nukes we traded and Armageddon ensued which was a real pity cause I was seriously wailing on his arse at the time this happened.  Finished reading ‘Restaurant at the End of the Universe’ which along with its predecessor goes straight into the ‘I need to read that one again’ pile of books. It is rather interesting though in an eclectic sort of way and has its own esoteric charm. Now I can divert my full attention to ‘Children of Dune’ which I shall hopefully conclude this week.    Unless of course my gangland activities come in the way. There is vicarious pleasure to be had in Tommy Vercetti’s spree of lawlessness in Liberty City and I partook whole heartedly. More on my life as a gangster shall be forthcoming as I make my way up the criminal ladder.

						    I hate Wednesdays. It’s been a long two days into the week and the end isn’t yet in sight (Sigh). More boring projects lead by imbecilic bosses threaten to overwhelm me.  &nbsp;  On the bright side though I did manage to start and finish The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy yesterday. It’s a strange sort of book and I’m not sure whether I like it or I don’t will most probably get around to reading it again slowly this time to get in more of the nuances but then again I say that to myself about so many books. My personal verdict on this book seems to have been thrown into an infinite improbability maelstrom the results of which should presently be available in say… oh about seven and a half million years :-).     Started on Children of Dune yesterday. Have promised myself to read this one slowly and comprehend it to avoid the whole reading it again cycle which is quite the precursor to utter chaos. This whole reading soo many books simultaneously with so many more waiting in the wings in kind of getting to me. Though I am glad that I have started reading so much again.

						   Its been a loooooonngg week. Work is a very strange thing when you have it, it always too much, when you don’t you feel guilty. Weekends for me constitute the promised land. A beautiful island of hope and joy in a sea of pounding work.    Just a few more miles separate me, the wearied dessert traveler, from the refreshing waters of my weekend oasis. Of course weekends present me with their own little conundrums but it’s a rather pleasant task to choose between sleeping, playing Rise of Nations, watching a movie or visiting brigade road (yet again).    There is one thing which bother me though. I haven’t been able to come up with a weekend project. I installed a shower in my loo the last weekend but the newness is kind of wearing off and I need a new project for this weekend.    Ughhhh… this whole doing something with my life thing is kind of getting to me. But truthfully speaking I do feel rather proud of myself when I do manage to complete something.    Hmmm….. strange but I suddenly feel an inspiration coming along…………..      Aaaahhhhh  how I love weekends.

						   A lot of people might find this surprising but I feel a lot more tired at the end of a vacation than at the beginning of one. Its been a week since I’ve been back and somehow the world still seems all screwed up, go figure.  The trip to Delhi in itself was rather nice if a tad on the hectic side. I’m still trying to figure out how I managed to make a two week vacation seem like a whirlwind two day trip. The heat must have had a large part to play in that the liberal use of AC’s (god bless the soul of the man who invented it) notwithstanding.  One thing I have to mention  though is that internal colony roads in Delhi are a shade or two better than the average main road in Bangalore and zipping around on Delhi roads just makes you realize how pathetic infrastructure in this little village actually is. Yes make no mistake Bangalore is little more than a village. A very wet puddle of a village these days.  I did watch a couple of movies while in Delhi both of them were (surprisingly) pretty decent. ‘Lakshya’ makes it a double directorial success for Farhan Akhtar who has won himself at least one faithful audience for his next venture whatever that might be. Though not accomplished with the same masterful ease as ‘Dil Chahta Hai’  ‘Lakshya’ does have its moments and manages to touch a cord or two while managing to tread the fine line between stirring patriotism and jingoism.  Could have done without the silly romance angle though but the average crowd has to be catered to I suppose. Which of course brings me to Miss. Zinta. Your dimples not withstanding ma’am what were you thinking???  The other flick I watched in those oh-so-comfy seats at ‘wave’ was Troy. Peterson does a competent enough job though he did take the story a couple of times round the proverbial block. Brad Pitt (surprisingly) did not look ludicrous as Achilles. In fact I think he carried the weight rather well. The real surprise of the movie though was a large tub of popcorn. You see I’m a big guy (read fat). And when a portion of popcorn is large enough and buttered enough to make me pause, just for a bit, before delivering my coup-de-grace it is truly something to be admired. Be in no doubt the outcome of the battle between the tub and me was as decided as Achilles Vs Hector but that popcorn earned my respect. (or maybe I’m getting old.)  One thing I discovered in Delhi was that hukka smoking is not for me. I’ve tried them all now from cigarettes to bidi’s through cigars onto hukka’s and every time I smoke it literally tears my throat to shreds the next morning. So I’m officially off all forms of smoking for the rest of my life. (apart from the luxoriously fruity delights of Bangalore busses coupled with the heady aroma of bangalore’s auto’s )  Tequila is not too my liking either though I must admit I did not have enough of it to test the old adage (1 tequile, 2 tequile, 3 tequila…… Floor).  Food in Delhi remains unconquered unlike the city itself, which has changed hands throughout history rather frequently.   So here I am back in this soaked, pothole infested village slogging it out with traffic once more at what is supposedly a flyover construction but looks like a battle zone (its more like a massacare). I am seriously thinking of calling for UN aid and international arbitration.
