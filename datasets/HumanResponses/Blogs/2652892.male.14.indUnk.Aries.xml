      You know what I hate even more than having to rip out all those little "Subscribe Now" cards in my magazines? Having to rip out all those little "Subscribe Now" cards in magazines I'm already subscribed to.  And you know what I hate even more than having to rip out all those little "Subscribe Now" cards in magazines I'm already subscribed to? WHEN THEY'RE ALL ON THE SAME FREAKIN PAGE.  So I'm skimming through my new WIRED mag today (which, by the way, is MUCH thicker and MUCH cheaper than Pop Sci) when I come across this page that I can't see a square inch of. Why not? Because of  6  little ads to subscribe.  urlLink What the heck?   One, I'm already subscribed, and I'm not willing to pay for 2 issues of each issue, and Two, even if I weren't subscribed, I sure as heck wouldn't need  6  little Business Reply cards to get me to sign up. What is with these people?  I'M ALREADY GETTIN YOUR MAGAZINE! I DON'T WANNA SUBSCRIBE AGAIN! DON'T SEND ME ANOTHER ONE UNTIL MY SUBSCRIPTION IS OVER! SOMEWHERE AROUND, OH, I DON'T KNOW, MARCH 2005!   here's a pic of the little pieces of trash blocking my view of the magazine page completely:

         This is great! After running and re-running Spybot and McAfee countless times, I can finally get some  real  help!. I found this place called  urlLink Spyware Warrior Forums , which tells you what to do after running a program called "Hijack This". I sure hope this works. This is  the  last place that can help me...

      Let's look at a piece of chain mail I got today, shall we?    Let's see...standard think of your crush and scroll down...lots of aterixsksxskz thingies...Oooh, now they're receding...allright. now what? "This is one of those chain letter things that everyone hates. This one has been going since 1863 and if you break this-"woah. What? 1863? Who writes this stuff?     Anyway, here's some stories about kids that have their mom die, their dad gets fired, their aunt gets fired, their dog gets food poisoning, their great-uncle gets hit by a bus, lightning destroys their hometown, their worst enemies gain evil superpowers, their drinking water turns magenta, their computer randomly changes its desktop, their crush dies, they are convicted of 3rd degree murder, their favorite magazine doesn't come, etc. etc.  all on the same day.  Well that's unfortunate. Why didn't anything bad happen to the kid? He's the one who didn't forward the email.    And I read on...Oh! A happy story! One kid forwarded it to a bunch of people. Then the next day, the kid wins the lottery, his dad buys him a new bike, his mom buys him both a PlayStation  and  an N64 (I didn't know they had those in the 1860's), his grandmother sends him a new computer, his best friend gives him tickets to a concert, he inherits a brand-new TV from his aunt, and his secret crush asked him out. Well he got a lot of stuff in one day. Unfortunately, the email fails to mention it was his 18th birthday that day.    onward-Now I'll just copy some lines from the email for you:    If you    send this to-         1       person- you will lose all luck in  ur love  life.....forever!!!!!        10 people- your crush will say  they like you as a  friend......ONLY!!!!!        15 people- your crush will say  they like you        20 people- your crush will ask you out!        25 people- your crush will  french kiss you!!        30 people or more- all of the above!!!!     Okay...um... So sending it to 1 person is worse than not sending it at all? I'll disregard that for a second.    Allright, I'm done disregarding that. So why does-Oh wait! 30 or more=All Of The Above?!?!  Hmm. I thought that was a gimmie. So if I only send this to 25 people, my crush is gonna french kiss me, but they won't say they like me, they won't even ask me out. But if I send it to 30 people, my crush says they like me, asks me out, and french kisses me.   Is that before or after they say they only like me as a friend?    And it goes on to say that I hafta act in an hour. You know, back in 1863, I highly doubt it was possible to send 30 snail mail messages in an hour. Maybe if you borrowed the printing press...

      It's official. Anchorman has beat Kung Pow on my list of the TOP 10 MOVIES EVER. That was by far the funniest movie I've ever seen! Here's my list as of now:  10  Airplane! 9   Planes, Trains, and Automobiles 8   Major League/ML2 7   UHF 6   Life Of Brian 5   School Of Rock 4   Spaceballs 3   Monty Python and the Holy Grail 2   Kung Pow! 1   Anchorman  There never has been a movie in the number 10 spot, so nothing got kicked out. Some of my fav lines from the movie: "I love lamp?" "Brick, where'd you get a hand grenade?" "I'm Ron... Burgundy?" "When in Rome..." "I don't know what we're yelling about!" "Ron, are you paying attention?" "No." "He  punted  your dog?" "Doesn't San Diego mean Saint Diego?"  -"Well, that could be it." -"No, I'm sure that's it." -"Well, we'll just agree to disagree." "Boy, that escalated quickly, didn’t it?" -"I’ll say. I stabbed a man right in the heart!" -"Yeah, how ’bout that? Brick killed a guy! What was that, a trident?" -"Yeah! I threw a trident and killed him!" -"I’ve been meaning to talk to you about that. You should probably go home, go stay with family, keep a low profile. Because, ah, you’re probably wanted for murder."  What a great movie. Especially when Jack Black punts Ferrell's dog over the edge of a bridge! :)  -Post comments below-

      A 14-year-old boy accused of shooting to death his family at ABC newsman Sam Donaldson's New Mexico ranch denied the charges in children's court Friday.  The teenager was charged with three counts of murder and four counts of tampering with evidence in the slayings Monday of his father, who managed Donaldson's ranch, his stepmother and his stepsister.  He told authorities that his father regularly abused him.  A judge granted District Atty. Scot Key 30 days to consider whether to prosecute the boy as an adult. Key said the boy could get up to 30 years in prison if convicted as an adult.  The judge also approved the appointment of an aunt on his late mother's side of the family as the teen's guardian.  However, he will remain in custody at a juvenile detention center in Albuquerque.  His mother was killed four years ago in a car accident.  According to court papers, the teen told sheriffs that his father often abused him and on Monday slapped him across the face for not cleaning horse stalls fast enough.  He then allegedly shot to death his father, stepmother and 14-year-old stepsister.  Copyright © 2004, Chicago Tribune  ---You know what Steve would say--  A long time ago, a baby was born into this world. A special baby; a baby of glory. He did have odd hair, though. He possessed a keen sense-a keen sense of local news. But even still, I wonder why.   Why can’t we be more like Sam Donaldson? Why can’t we be more like he? You know he’s quite the news broadcaster. You know he’s full of majesty.   Yes, Sam Donaldson is full of majesty! Majesty!   Majesty!   Majesty!   He looks into the camera and he tells us all the truth.   Sam, dearest Sam, You’ve somehow turned back the clock. Your hair is hard and mighty. Your eyebrows like Mr. Sprock. I envy his demeanor. I feel his sharp razor wit. But, why? But, why can’t we be more like Sam Donaldson? Why can’t we be more like he? You know he’s quite the news broadcaster. You know he’s full of majesty.   Yes, Sam Donaldson is full…of… maj…es…ty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wow, I just saw like the 2 best commercials in the past 24 hours. The first one was for Hertz, and there's this guy talking "At our car rental company, we include a personal navigator with every car" Then there's this wacky oriental guy sitting between 2 businessmen in the back seat of a car. He's wearing this crazy outfit, with gold ornaments and this silk hat, and he looking at a map and mumbling to himself in some foreign language. That itself cracked me up. Then, his eyes get really wide, he throws down the map and starts screeching like a flying monkey in his foreign language. He shoves his arm in the driver's face. Everyone's screaming. Then there's a shot from outside, and the car's doing doughnuts and narrowly missing cars. It was great.  The other one was for Dell, and there's this guy making modifications to the company's computers using duct tape cuz they're too cheap to get new computers. There were all these people with crappy computers all duct-taped together. And this one guy's is shooting out floppies at him. Then they go to this other guy and the "IT guy" is explaining the 3 monitors in front of him-"This one's for spreadsheets, this one's for word processing, and this one-"He looks at one screen with all this random junk, words numbers, on it."um..." Back to the guy with the floppy shooter. He's now got the timing down and he's catching them as the come out. Back to 3 monitor man. "Well, I don't...uh...really know what this one's for."  Good TV these days. :) Have you seen 'em? Post your comments below!
