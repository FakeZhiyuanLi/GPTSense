						     ok, a week a go today i had my first day of this job iv got for the rest of summer, so it all goes well and that, a little boring ya know but its a job so anyway it involved using a lot of water and at the end of the day i was asked to turn of the water by the water hydrant by the entrance to the place so i went to do it and it went a bit wrong. see i forgot to close the valve which lets the water through so i pulled a pipe out, turned the tap of and then went to pull out the main ...thing..., as ya can see im not even that good with plumbin linguo, so i pulled it out and was answered with a face full of water, I BUST THE FRICKIN WATER HYDRANT!?!$*?! it was like in the cartoons and that and all this water was comin outa this little hole in the floor so i threw the pipe down and ran. i could only say in my defence it was my first day. rest of the week went ok but a phobia of taps is slowly developing. friday i got half drunk then got bored, got sum chips and went home = crap nite. and......thats......it! nuthin much happenin, saw a flock of geese today, if you would like some details of this spectacular event don't hesitate to comment, it was quite interesting compared to everything else this week, apart from 'that' incident. sorry i dont speel right sometimes and don't paragraph, i never really understood paragraphing anyway. felt i should write something cos i never really have, ive wasted enough precious minutes of your life now so il shut up thank you please.
