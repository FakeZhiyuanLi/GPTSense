      I finally bought the new 213 album and i TOTALLY love it!!!  Snoop Dogg, Warren G, and Nate Dogg bustin' the funky rap hits that I miss so much from Cali.  Not a lot of people listen to West Coast rap out here.. I mean the real good stuff too... but what do you expect?!  Listening to my new 213 album made me think of another thing about Buffalo.. how many tools live here.. namely boys.  I mean I have met my fair share of the fellas.. different races, different ages, hell.. even different backgrounds.. but what do they all have in common?  They are all major tools!  Maybe I am jaded because I was married and I still have that resentment that I was out manuvered by him, or maybe it is my underlying inability to get close to another guy anymore.. but in general.. I just think all these guys are all morons who if i had to go even on a second date with any of them.. I would as for a noose and a stool to accompany me on the date.  It is sad to think I would rather sit at home and read or organize my clothes, then go on a date and maybe even get a little makeout from one of them.  They just call and call.. and I never call any of them back.  Why did I become such an a-hole?  Sometimes I think it is just because I know that once the new year begins, I plan on moving back to Cali and it just isn't worth the effort to begin a relationship only to end it come January.  Unless it was James of course.  James is that perfect man that I know I will never be with.. that unattainable man that haunts me because of his poor choice in a girlfriend.  I mean who chooses their mates based on their proximity to their house.  I mean.. I have a car for crying out loud.. I would gladly drive to his house to see him.  I don't know.. maybe I just like James because of just that.. I  will never have him.  What if the only reason I look for him week after week downtown is that I know I am safe in wishing for him because I will never have to actually be with him?  The more I think about relationships the more I don't want one.  I do want the snuggling each night, I do want the arm I get to hold onto while I sleep, I do want those looks that only a guy and a girl in love can give eachother that is worth so much more then words... but to be honest I just don't want everything else that comes with it.  So as I sit here.. ready to go to work tomorrow.. as I have completely consumed myself in my work..  I am forced to think if this is healthy for myself.. and what if that guy is waiting out there for me...  am I ready to commit to him?

      Well it is Tuesday night and I am exhausted.. but still alive!  I definitely worked yesterday from 9am til 5pm, then came home to do homework.. only to go back from 10pm until 3:30am.  What for you ask?  Oh yes.. the visit that we certainly did not get today.. so pretty much all that for nothing.  Friends and Family was a dud as well.. but it was fun since we had a load of people on the floor.  I was really mad about last night because I cancelled a date with a cutie to go to work and get it straightened up.. so the fact that it was a fruitless attempt was nto exciting to me.  Danielle and I are going out on the town this weekend.. and I cannot wait!!  I am looking forward to getting hit on by losers and drinking drinks that are way too watered down for the 4$ they charge to make them.  Anyway..  that is about it.. I (as always) have to work tomorrow in the a.m.

      So it is wednesday night and I am getting ready for the best 4 days of my life.. friends and family days at the gap.  For those of you who do not work at the gap.. lucky you.. you aren't missing much other than a discount.  Friends and Family days are days that gap has especially set aside for you to watch your friends.. and family.. shop while you are at work. Not just that.. you watch them complain because you don't have that medium lilac kangaroo pocket shirt they really wanted. You watch pick up things to see how they feel, then carelessly throw the item back onto the very table you just spent 10 minutes folding... but it is okay.  Why?  Because they just threw that shirt on top of all the other shirts that have been tossed away like careless trash by your co-workers family and friends... so you are not the only one suffering.. they are too  :)

      So here it is 14 some odd months later and I am still in Buffalo.  Do I mind it? Not so much anymore.  Would i leave?  In a heartbeat!  I have definitely made myself a great life here; I have wonderful friends here as well as those around the country that are always there for me.  Oh.. by the way.. you can all thank Molly for this since she turned me on to this journaling crap.  Well actually Steven is ultimately to blame.. but I will cut him some slack as he did just return from Australia.  I figure this is a great way to let you all know how I am doing and share some of myself with those who do not know me so well.. hey.. I might even learn something by doing this.  There is a lot going on right now between school and my life, so I hope to use that as my inspiration for these journals.
