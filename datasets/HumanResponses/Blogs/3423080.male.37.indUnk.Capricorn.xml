      It's been a really interesting year for me, foodwise that is.   I'm truly on my way to becoming a Jedi Carnivore, now having intoduced a few new species to stomach.    While in New Orleans for Jazzfest(Which will now be refered to as 'Boozefest' as I can't recall hearing much Jazz), I found myself at a little restaurant called 'Jacamo's(spelling?), I believe it was on Oak Street but can't be sure as Boozefest was in high gear.  Regardless,    We got to the restaurant late so our friends were there and had already ordered appetizers.  The host of the evening was rather excited to be back in his hometown after so many years gone and was enjoying playing tour guide for us.  As soon as I sat down he, with a tad too much enthusiasm, shoves an appetizer plate in front of me stating it was 'Alligator Lasagna' and I should really try it. Normally, I'm a little more adventurous with food but after three days of Boozefest( and the ten mini crystal burgers(New Orleans equivalent to White Castle) the night before) my stomach was a touch queasy and I wasn't quite mentally nor physically prepared for the dish. My stomach was already turning at the thought of eating a big-ass scaly gator. In an effort to maintain the facade of the tough New Yorker I, without any discernable hestation, took a healthy bite of the dish and was relieved that the lasgana bit of the dish completely overwhelmed the weird funky alligator taste I had been imagining. With a queasy sense of relief I passed the dish over to the next person in the tasting queue to let them deal with their own personal 'eat it' or 'don't eat it' issues.   As I was preparing to reach for the menu, with the hope of finding an entree most compatible with Boozefest, maybe something with a lot of bread in it like a burger or a salad heavy with croutons, Our happy host shoves another dish in front of me declaring it's rabbit. The dish was apparently prepared chicken fingers style, sliced up rabbit meat, breaded and deep fried, served with some wacky, Bobby Flayish, spicy mayo dip.  Now I never owned no chicken and I never owned no cow, but I have been the owner of several cute little fluffy bunny rabbits in my life; the current surviving one being named Oscar (I am not gay).  Perhaps I may have been a vegetarian had I pet such as 'Charlie Chicken' or 'Mooey the Cow', and was able to identify the meat I was masticating with fond memories of loyal companionship.    Imagining stupid little Oscar on the dish in front of me made my brain really work the queasy switch in my gut.  So, with the same feigned New York City machismo, again without hesitation and resigned to knowing that I'm just the kind of idiot who would eat whatever satan's host put in front of me, I took a bite of the rabbit 'chicken' finger.  Of course it tasted just like chicken but the meat was much more dense, perhaps the wascally rabbit's muscles were stronger from the excessive running it did, in a Warner Brothers-esque attempt, to escape the butcher's 'Acme' deep fryer. Chalk one up to Chef Fudd.  Nonetheless, I passed the dish over as the queasiness rose to a head. While I chewed Oscar's cousin(hoping he wouldn't smell his kin on my breath when I returned to NYC), I eyed that I was scott free as I recognized the remaining appetizers were of a variety compatible with Boozefest.  No steaming Monkey brain dish was looming on the horizon.  As I initiated the swallowing process(I had to think of it in a very clinical sterile way), I glanced over at my girlfriend, co-owner and advocate of the aforementioned Oscar, I noticed she was giving me 'THAT LOOK'. Actually, a really really bad 'THAT LOOK', worse than I've ever seen.  If she ever caught me engaged in a sexual escapade with a crack whore and an HIV positive goat I don't think I would get a 'THAT LOOK' that severe(then again, you never know what sets a chick off, sheesh!).  She just stared at me in shock as if her brain were stuck in a computer glitch.  I imagined her as 'The Terminiator', analyzing me with her ruby red vision, calculating, dissecting and rebuilding me in wireframe, crosshairs circling then pinpointing me. Finally the circuits unlooped and the analysis came out of her vocal projectors, "Traitor!".  She hissed that accusatory word the same way one would hiss, "Cannibal!".   I think she thinks we're rabbits.  Anyway, to wrap things up awkwardly, upon returning to NYC, I seemed to have expanded the, 'What New Animals I Have Eaten', catalogue in New York's Chinatown.   Which will, hopefully,  be layed down in a future blog enttitled, 'Thank God I Don't Own No Pidgeons!"  Peace Frank S.
