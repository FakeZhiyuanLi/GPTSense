      im so fed up... i have canoe training today actually... but because NCC today was put in charge to decorate the hall because our school is organising a musical "army daze".. i had the design done the week before and gave it to our unit CO.. actually the design was supposed to be done by me and another guy A.. this guy last minute then ask me want to come out and discuss or not i told him no need.. cos it was like already last minute already then ask me want to do or not it was really kinda bo chup [dun care].. so i did the design myself...  today got canoe training i did not go.. cos i think that NCC today will need more help because we have to put up quite alot of decorations... this guy A say that he had to go for canoe training... i also got canoe training what... how come i can stay in school to help while he cant? i think this is quite too much... we go for the NCC CLT course but when really need help this guy ACTUALLY disappeared for his second CCA... i dun like this kind of people honestly speaking... u want u stick to one CCA and commit to it lahz... why wanna come here come there? and u actually left only 3 CLTS to do up the whole hall.... this guy A still want to act like he got help like that still call my fellow CLT and ask him "is everything ok?" i feel like whacking him when my friend told me about this...  we had to like 3 people to do 5 people work... some still need to take care of many places.... climb up climb down... EVEN the CO have to do the job by helping us... what is this? CLT dun come and help CO come and do....  that time i was being called down to HQ to CLEAN TOILET!!! clean not just one BUT 10 TOILETS... each toilet still got 6 CUBICLES... total SIXTY cubicles... this guy A say he dunno that it was to clean toilet... i was really like wanna stick the whole brush at his ass lohz... and the toilets are not normal toilets.... they totally reeks... how clean can an army camp toilet be? it was like 10 yrs never use liaoz... u see the water its all KOPI O colour... this one i was slowly forgeting liaoz then this damn guy still only call 2 persons.... only ME the suay one and another older guy... we have to scrub the toilets lehz...  u think i will get fed up or not? sibei buay zi dong lehz... let me cool down manz....

      sigh.. this yrs parade is so such a disappointment.. firstly the coming out of the RSM.. the RSM should march out smartly mahz.. the Bagpipers blow until like the indian RSM like dancing like that... which is stupid i think... there should be like the military march in buggles only mahz... this one is parade lehz.. not play "di tanjong katong" lehz... need bagpipers for what..  then the NDP 2004 the word so small... the banner is small... haha... but ok lahz.. then the NCC commander still wear 5T.. which is a long sleeved shirt and a tie.. i think he thought he was going for Dinner... haha..  then the march in of the guard of honour is so "nice"... they march in from both sides... i think its rather bo liaoz... then the colours party still march in from the back... then its like they performing ching gay like that... or precision drill... funny sia... ok.. some say it was creative...  the supporting contingents were like better in strength... cos more people.. the parade commander also shouted like funny.. maybe cos he the commanding officer so seldom shout... but i think last years parade was better... cos its by 1ST BATTLION SINGAPORE GUARDS...  i think commandos more suitable for the pre-parade segment.. the flying down.. i mean rappelling one... i think they should be more active for those moves that shouting lohz... ok... still the pre parade segment were better...

      wha seh.. yesterday i 4am then start to sleep.. this morning 9am kanna waken up by all horns of cars and lorries... then i wake up lahz... actually the eager for me to shout down call them "diam" one.. but i see the situation is like the cars and lorries want to buy "auto" i mean toto.. or buy their own car plate number.. got one red lorry like the booth like that...  COS THE STUPID RED LORRY BLOCK THE WHOLE WAY... BRAINLESS IDIOT!! dunno how to park car sia... kindergarden i think the driver never play car before lahz... mei you tong nian [no childhood]  following behind the troublemaker is the bigger lorry... those lift things lorry...  then catching up with them is another car, another bigger lorry and a BRIDE CAR [xin niang che in direct translation] and then A BIGGER LORRY... so in total is 3 Big lorries and about 3 cars... 3 big lorries then think of ways to let the cars all come out lohz... aiya.. i mean the DRIVERs...  so the 3 lorries dunno how they move and turn [cos i inside bathing] they already park to one side and let the other vehicles all move... i think the brainless no childhood driver is either deaf or the ears is 10 yrs never dig liaoz... horn until a heavy sleeper [although i not very heavy(weight)] like me can wake up liaoz...  the bride car lucky can come out sia... if not can act a live telecast of "runaway bride"...  the situation now is that the 3 lorry drivers sitting down.. waiting... OMG.. the brainless no childhood and 10yrs no dig ear driver is out... lucky he was not beatened up like beat egg like that... i think the 3 drivers should just use the lifting mechanism, load up the lorry to the big lorry.. send for dumping...  stupid driver.. thats all for NEWS REPORTING CHANNEL TNN...

      yesterday we were having design studios.. we have to design body furniture.. that is some will be incharge of the head [which is our grp], arms, body and also legs.. we have to take measurements of different sizes of people... i was so popular for the first time everybody were grabbing me.. "i first..""no i come first".. lucky my arms never broke... cos they pulling from each side.. if not really can measure the arms already...  they took pictures of me... touch me... eat my toufu.. ask me questions... i was like the most amazing animal in the zoo.. but they come zoo never buy tickets one... just take photos all these one.. one part time teacher still ask why i so popular.... -_-''' see my size know liaoz lahz...  finally after about 1:30 minutes of harassment... they left back to their groups to do the project... they say my head small... so funny when we measure the head was big... [inside i think all coconut water] still having a perfect figure... although i everytime eat as much as i can i still wont get fat... metalbolism rate too high?  after that at 5pm... left for home... had to go back to henderson at 6pm... i was late.. cos from sch to house already need around 40  minutes... plus bathing.. then around 1805 then reach... bought i new ranger hat.. so cool... but expensive at the same time 19bucks...  excorting the very important person from HQ NCC... RSM NCC brought his family along... 2LT Eugene brought her girlfriend.. 3SG affendy was as usual with his honda $9000 bike.. BUT this time round we saw his girlfriend.. we finally saw the phone girl.. everytime affendy will be talking to his "friend"[ he say she is his friend to my principal..].. always smiling to the phone when it rings... and finally saw the ONE... 2SG suren brought her girlfriend also...  ARMY DAZE the musical was finally played.. with our guest of honour, miss indranee.. [i still remembered that when i was in sec 3, i was supposed to open the door for her when she first came to our school... first thing i thought she was a tamil... the car came.. the person who was not driving was a tamil.. it makes me doubly sure that she was the indranee... i opened the door for her and my officer say wrong person... i was so pai sei... anyway she was late.. and the musical was late also...  actually the show was quite nice although it was performed by hendersonians... but the hall suddenly became a bird cage... people keep whistling and whistling making funny sounds... making the show not as good... if those "birds" can be shot down by the hunters, thats better...  people behind the scene usually were not being praised... this time round it was true... we CLTs help out our effort for the ARMY DAZE decorations... but was not mentioned... nevermind.. =>  after show when everyone left we had to clear the chairs and put in different chairs... some of the chairs were heavy.. but i carried... and the chairs were dirty.... we had to clean... SAIKANG WARRIORS... NCC aka National Cadet Corps has now been National Cleaning Chairs... left the school at around 10pm to 11pm... went to eat... found out that the hawker now like so little people... and many stalls were closed... i ate Hor Fun with my fellow CLTs.. i ate that reached home at 0000hrs SHARP...  went to sleep... cos tomorrow got school at 0800hrs...

      Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson go on a camping trip, set up their tent, and fall asleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes his faithful friend.    "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see."   Watson replies, "I see millions of stars."   "What does that tell you?"   Watson ponders for a minute. "Astronomically speaking, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets.  Astrologically, it tells me that Saturn is in Leo. Timewise, it appears to be approximately a quarter past three. Theologically, it's evident the Lord is all-powerful and we are small and insignificant. Meteorologically, it seems we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. What does it tell you?"    Holmes is silent for a moment, then speaks. "Watson, you idiot, someone has stolen our tent."
