      The Jazz Fest starts tonight!!  The tourists are here in the masses!  I'm going to head out to the open-air show, and hopefully not re-experience what that old man did to me on the metro today..... Ick!!  Yuck!!!!  Bleck..... *shudders*...... Nevermind.   Ew.  I was meeting with a mentor of mine for a drink earlier this evening, and I had a gin and tonic while he had a rum and coke.  When we finished those, he ordered another round, but I had a Diet Coke instead.  He thought this was odd.  "Celeste," he asked, "How do you expect to write a believable dramedy about substance abuse when you have never experienced  intoxication ? How are you qualified?  You must write that which you know...".... I debated for a moment whether or not to tell him, and I decided to go for it.  Like Jack Kerouac wrote (before he drank himself to death), "O the pain of telling these secrets which are so necessary to tell, or why write or live" ( The Subterraneans , p. 17)... Ok, without getting too preachy now (look at me, quoting Kerouac, sheesh)I explained: I have avoided these things because I am not so egotistical to think I'm strong enough to be in control of the things which have held hostage my father, sister, brother, aunts and uncles, cousins, great uncles, and grandparents...  But  seeing this first hand for 23 years (and being sober the whole time) puts me in the perfect position to talk, and even joke about it as I do... but it's a  cautionary  joke.  And believe me,  I know far too well...  Vous me comprenez bien, j'espere...   *wink*   Anyhow, there are plenty of other things in life which are intoxicating in their own way...  On a different note, I finished my professional communications class today with an A (one percentage point away from an A+).  And then my professor asked me out.  He's a very handsome and intelligent man (only 13 years my senior, which is just under the wire for my 15 year rule), but it just didn't seem appropriate to me, as I have another semester before I finish this program in early December.  But yes.... an A....  *pats self on back*

      You know what's embarrassing?  Falling down a flight of stairs at a fancy restaurant.    Other than that, I had a big day:   Meeting with my agent.... Sergio: Celeste, you look great! Me: Thanks, so do you. Sergio: How much do you weigh now? Me: 126 Sergio:  Plus 5 pounds cause you're a liar right? Me:... Exactly. Sergio: You know, if you wanted... I bet you  would  be 126 if you started smoking... (opens his cigarette case for me) Me: No thanks.  ..... My agent is kind of a butthead, really.  Hi Sergio   :)  I haven't said butthead in years.  Other than that I had a four-hour professional communications class, a few hours at my office (had to translate a 15 page document from French to English), dinner with Crystal (at a vegetarian restaurant... I ate like a rabbit), and then I stopped by my parents house to hang out for a bit.  Of course, my Mom had "Last Comic Standing" on... It kind of annoys me that Jay Mohr introduces every single comedian with "...the very funny... so-and-so!"   .  So I went downstairs to see my brother and sister and I begged my sister to go with me to Los Angeles because I don't want to go to a stange city alone.  Marg is so much more tough than I am...  plus, I don't like to dine alone   :p    Script update:  I had Matthew (College professor, literary genius) read the first 20 pages of my script, and he is freaking out over it.  He liked my pasts scripts as well.    He loves this one, he said it's very funny but still insightful and smart.  This is remarkably encouraging news for me  :D For those of you who were interested in taking part of the July script-reading, you can reach me on my cell: 514.575.9345  It is a beautiful night out there, I'm going to enjoy it a little before I hit the sack.

      I could talk about my script, or my meeting with my agent (acting, not literary) tomorrow, or even about the fact that  I'm going to be doing an improv show for charity on Canaday Day  (!... it's been a long time).... I'll plug that tomorrow, though.  I'm sleepy and feel a tiny bit shameful because I voted for Paul Martin (lesser of two evils)... and for now  I feel like talking about a comedian who really embarrassed me at a show tonight... Yikes!   We went to Montreal's biggest comedy club , which is a block and a half away from my apartment, only for me to get called up on stage and have him realize  I'm 5'9"  (6'0 with the heels I was wearing)  towering over his 5'6"...  he then called me "Freaky Amazon Woman"  (ok, let's not go crazy).  He asked me for my measurements, that was annoying... What was even more annoying was that Crystal gave them to him to share with the audience.  Then there were the hoots and the hollers and he smacked my butt (I can play along with the jokes, but sir, don't touch my bum please!), told the audience it was firm (I was annoyed... and smug).. he then said I was tense and asked me when was the last time I had sex (don't rub it in!  I'm single and I'm just not that kind of girl!), asked me what I'm doing with "grandpa" (my  friend  Jean Michel, who is only 36 which is age appropriate for me anyway!) and then, distracted by Crystal's car-alarm laughter, moved on to her.... Thank goodness!...   Anyway, he was bad.  There is a shortage of really good comedians out there... And the good ones only come here once a year for the Just For Laughs Festival.  Luckily, we get to occasionally watch the really awesome comedians, like  Juston McKinney  on  Jay Leno  *  My plans to go to NYC are coming together nicely, while my plans to go to LA at the end of July are falling apart!  Gaah!  Mel's going to be in Amsterdam so I can't stay there (don't worry though Mel, you're still welcome to stay here during the Just For Laughs Festival)... So I have to find out what two nights at an LA hotel are going to cost me (my soul?).  American dollars make me cringe!    *Juston McKinney will be on Jay Leno with Ben Stiller on Thursday, July 1st 2004 11:35/10:35 on NBC    ... Yes, I realize that's Canaday Day, but I'll probably pop a video in the machine while I'm doing the improv.   In tomorrow's post, I will promote myself shamelessly!

      I'm currently on campus printing out a document while, as far as I can tell by his message in the chatterbox, Jason (Jessica's fiance) is at my apartment emptying my fridge.  I'm a little concerned though, as I've been out of town since Friday morning, and my fridge doesn't keep food well.  It's like....   the petri-fridge  .  Jason, my thoughts are with you.  I recommend you stop eating my food and just throw it all out, and I'll make you something to bring home with you later!   I have things to write, I can't keep them in much longer but I have to go to the South Shore to vote for the next PM.... Shall I vote for what I believe in or shall I vote strategically?  I have an hour to decide.  I'll update again tonight...

      I don't drink (except the very occasional glass of wine at dinner), I don't smoke (anything)... and I rarely drink coffee.  But I was dragging my feet today, so I stopped for a cup...  Where do Canadians go for coffee?  Why, Tim Horton's of course.  Maybe it's the sexy uniforms? How about the vastness and vagueness in the eyes of the employee as you repeat your order slowly, and employing monosyllabic wording? How about those snappy commercials that perpetuate Canadian stereotypes like that we all like maple syrup, beer, Hockey and live in igloos…  I think it’s actually a two-fold issue: there is the fact that Tim Horton's sells their coffee at what is considered a good price, nowadays. I went to Starbucks once, and when I heard “that’ll be 5 bucks and your firstborn child please!” I had an "old fart" moment. Don’t get me wrong about cheapness, but if I pay that much for coffee, I want to see the Columbian farmer’s standard of living go right up!   Second, people generally like their coffee with the cream and sugar in it (not me: lactose intolerant... but other than that I'm low maitenance, I swear)! I mean, what ever happened to service in North America? There is something downright inimical about standing in line to get your coffee, waiting in line to pay and then waiting in line to add your own cream and sugar! You look up at the pow-wow around the cream counter and everybody subconsciously thinks: “Darn, we’re stupid!” I think, crap they just paid 5 bucks for this two cents worth of beans! Are you telling me your overhead can’t handle the extra assembly step?   Twenty years from now, we may find out Tim Horton was loading their beans with cocaine, but I like to think we’re just a common sense country.

      In the conservatory, with the candle stick... My buddy Luc says Vote Harper 'cause:  "Hello I am Steven Harper, and intend to calmly speak my way into a leadership position.   I don’t want you to vote for me because of my platform; hell I would rather keep that platform nicely tucked away and then WHAM! Nail you with ridiculous military, a NAFTA “bend over for bush” deal and tearing Kyoto up and mailing the pieces back to whatever Jap’ made it up!!!!   Look, right now you may not understand the role of Battleships for peace keeping missions in Afghanistan or humanitarian work in Haiti, but believe me, it’s all good. Just look at my proposed mechanized land fleet as  love-mobiles  carrying extra food next to the 20 mm cannon. In the worst case, vote for me to punish Martin…yeah punish him real good…oh, yeah stick that big black sleekdom up his…ahem, ahem.   As for gay rights…hhhheeeeyyy I’m easy! I say give the free vote ‘cause after all…the “tyranny of the masses” can never be wrong, so I thought I would leave it to the parliament…composed of fifty to sixty year olds. Yep! I say let these people decide the next fifty years; thirty of which they won’t be around to see. Hell, everyone knows that humanitarian rights and the American constitution were really brought about by maw and paws! (sarcasm).   Anyhoooot! I want you to know that I won’t be tough on immigration, since my own ancestry is not from Canada. Nope, my grandfather immigrated here in ’46 from Germany where he was a lieutenant in the military.   If that isn’t reason enough, just look at my family, that blond, blue eyed vision of perfection. That’s Ary my son, and Arian my daughter. My wife Reltih and I work very hard to persuade them that they are called upon to be the best Canadians they can be. We teach them the basic values of Canada, such as the fact that poor people just don’t put the energy into getting out of poverty, and that we should strive for a trickle down economy, where the wealthy use up vast resources, so bountiful that the extra’s falling to lower spectrums should be enough to keep them happy and indented.   As for health care, I don’t want to privatize so much as set working relationships with private industry for the delivery of services for “PUBLICLY” agreed compensations! After all, are we really being fair to NAFTA, when we don’t offer up the fattest friggen piece of meat?   Okay, dokey, if you’re scared of me, vote for me to send me back to the furthest regions of your cranium. If you do like me, vote for me cause you want to be me, and if none of the above is the case…I’ll get you later."

      Woah.  I was just at the beach going for a morning swim, then having a chat with some of my father's friends.  They were in the process of asking me whether or not I'm beginning to feel safe at my apartment again (I was mugged not long ago outside my building in broad daylight... in one of the safest areas in Montreal, too!)and at one point they suddenly became very distracted and were having trouble following what I was saying.  I knew there was cleavage in the area.    I turned around and... yowza, there it was.  A woman perhaps a couple of years my senior was wearing this tight faux-suede one-piece with a zipper down the front... except her (what would the most lady-like word be?) breasts (there we go) were so (ladylike...) large (ok) that she couldn't even zip her swimsuit up all the way.  She had it zipped up as much as possible in a way that gave her that bubbly plate-of-boobs kind of cleavage... Why do women do that?  Do their heads get tired, so they need to rest their chins on their breasts?  Are they narcoleptic and need to take frequent naps on their cleavage?    Hmm... I'm not jealous.... I'm just concerned for the.... umm.. children.  Yikes!  I'm considering swallowing my pride and asking that senior editor to let me re-take the editing test.  Is that pathetic?  I have to spend less time writing in this blog and more time editing my script.  Cheers for now!

      Mr. Senior Editor of the publishing house sent me the editing test via e-mail, then called me and asked me to edit the text   immediately  and send it back to him.  What, does he think I'm going to cheat?  I graduated with honors and never cheated on a single test or assignment in my entire academic history (or personal, for that matter), which, believe me, was discouraging while the rest of the "honors" students were writing on their bellies and arms and ankles.  Anyhow, Mr. Senior Editor said the job offer was only on the table for me if I passed the editing test with 100%.  Of course, I occasionally think I'm much smarter than I actually am so I raced through the test (ok, I'm also at the cottage and wanted to go meet my father for a boat ride- who knows when I'll be able to escape the city again?)...  I completed the test, and he already replied with my results.  I didn't get 100%... Would anyone like to know why?  Probably not, but I'm going to tell you anyway!  Mr. Senior Editor (isn't it annoying that I keep writing that?) decided to deny me the job based on  two   very debatable   comma splices .  Grrr...   Grrr, I say.  Oh, there was another mistake too.  Apparently, in the States they spell it "pajamas" instead of the traditional European/Canadian "pyjamas"... I corrected it thinking it was a spelling error.  Crap... should have just checked www.dictionary.com ....  Pajamas.... Pajamas.  It looks funny to me!  So, finally, I guess I won't be assistant to Senior Editor at this "young, young age"  (yeah, he actually said that.... that's blatant age-ism!).  Off to the bonfire and midnight swim, I go!  Wheee!   :)  God, I missed the country.  I'm planning to be in NYC and other huge metro areas in the States this summer.... I'll have to make sure I make a few pit stops here or at the house in Gaspe (right on the ocean!) in between to decompress  :)

      I was swimming with some old friends (mostly married friends who already have children) and my friend Andrew mentioned that he's been flirting with the idea of buying a new car and selling his old one, Dr. Zhivago.  My other friend, Charlie, then asked if he could take her for a test drive.  Andrew then shot Charlie this  look ...  Kind of made me think of a guy who just dumped his hot girlfriend and his friends are already asking if it's ok to sleep with her.     Teehee.   Ok, back to the editing process...

      I am thoroughly enjoying this cottage!  I'm enjoying even more thoroughly the lake right in front of it!  I woke up this morning and had a hot bowl of oatmeal while sitting out in a chair on the dock by the water, while wearing a big wooly sweater (it gets chilly in the mornings).  A family of ducks swam by.  And I felt like I was in a commercial.  Was tempted to belch or something just to break the tension.    I'm off to do some more editing of "Vodkadvice"... I'm organizing a script reading for the end of July, and I want the script to be as clean as possible by then.  Also, I was offered a job as an editor at a publishing house... On one condition.  I have to pass the editing test with 100%.  Gaah!  No pressure, right?  They're going to e-mail me the text this morning.  I'll keep everyone posted on how that goes.  Yikes.  Hmm, maybe I'll go for a swim before I edit.

      Uh huh... uh huh... Ok. So. I just had my father over and we spent about an hour and a half trying to set up this satellite thing, and he kept saying "co-axial this" and "co-axial that" and although I'm sure he thought he was helping, the word co-axial is just not a part of my vocabulary and was stressing me out more than anything. It was nice for a change, though, to have my Dad around again helping me out with household nonsense- now that I live alone, whenever the toilet overflows ( which, I swear, it rarely does !) or when my electronics go wonky, I wish I had my father around .... No wonder I got so serious with an engineer after moving out. But... why did I break up with him again.  Oh, right ...  I really shouldn't be fiddling with the satellite anyway (or for that matter, this laptop I'm typing away at) considering where I am...  I'm currently in a lovely little cottage (complements of my parents) on the lake... my nearest neighbor is the forest (oh, and yes, the bears... but I'm trying not to think about them). Before today, I haven't had the opportunity to get out of the scorching hot city since Thanksgiving (read: Canadian Thanksgiving... so October, not November)... I can actually hear crickets chirping and choirs of frogs croaking, and when I stand on the dock outside my screen door (can you believe it, I actually have a screen door!) I can see tons and tons of stars. I was starting to forget what they look like. This is certainly going to get those creative juices going... Not that I've been, in any way, lacking ideas (except for " how the frick do I hook up this satellite? ")...  Cet fin de semaine, je relaxe... Je suis stressee a cause de mes cours de l'ete. Des le 30 juin, j'ai fini... Et j'ai reussis!  I'm thrilled my parents let me have this cottage for the weekend. And although I'm a grown woman now living alone in Montreal, it is rather comforting to know that, at the moment, my parents are just around the bend of the road. Or, just over the hill behind this place (would never walk across at night though... v. terrifying thought,  indeed ).  One thing I had my heart set on this weekend: watching "Puppets Who Kill". It's a  guilty pleasure , a dark and twisted show on the Comedy Network, presumably Canadian (too twisted to be American, and certainly not British)... Perhaps I'll go watch it with Mum and Dad tomorrow night.  I just realized my father stocked this fridge with booze.... He must be confusing me with someone else.

      There's not much out there to boost the ego better than an e-mail box and voicemail box full of messages from people who have noticed you've gone "MIA".  I've been in NYC, as well as on the beach at my cottage.    Things I have learned: - Pasty Irish and French girls shouldn't wear SPF 8 sun oil... Especially not pasty Irish-French girls (namely: me). - When attractive men introduce themselves, try to listen to their names and store them to avoid embarrassment later. -Look both ways before crossing. -When your best friend is about to start her period, it is not a good time to tell her that her ex is engaged. -Never disagree with a potential producer or buyer in the first meeting. -Don't meet someone as a writer while dressed like an actress.  They're think you're over-ambitiously trying to become a hyphenate.   Dress the part:  comic writers wear sneakers, other writers (usually men) wear loafers.  Neither wear stilleto sandals.   As most of you have noted, tomorrow is my birthday....  I'm much too young to be so anxious about birthdays.  If I were a smoker, that would be a different story.  Hehe...

        My voicemail box is full, you guys!  I left early on Friday to go...  out of t own for a weekend of lightning storms, swimming, tanning (or trying to!  I'm so white).  I went for Moroccan food at Pat and Jane's cottage, then spent the evening with them as well as Cameron, Julie, Paul, Janice, bla bla bla.. Everyone was up there this weekend.  We had fireworks and late night swimming... it was nice!  I stayed by myself at the lakeside cottage.  Mmm!  My LA plans are coming together finally except for one flaw in the plan.... But as far as I can tell, I'm going to be there for 11 days... I'm going to be staying in Jack's apartment near Santa Monica beach while he's away.... problem is there is one night I can't stay there.  So.  We'll see.    I'm getting there...  I'm almost finished "Vodkadvice".... my next project is a collaboration with actress/writer Marg McGrail (yes, my sister).  We were making notes.. it's going to be GREAT.  It's a comedy called "23 Orgasms"...  but it's not how it sounds.  Sort of.  Night night....  Happy Independence Day (belated!)
