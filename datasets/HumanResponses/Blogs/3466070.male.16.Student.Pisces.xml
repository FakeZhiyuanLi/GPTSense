      On the 29th I went to the Kittie concert. It was one hell of a show! There were five bands. One local Canadian band(there first time touring the states), 12 Tribe, 36 Crazy Fist, Canderia, and of course Kittie! It was by far the best show I have seen. Kitties mosh pit was crazy! Kittie had an awesome stage show. They had Black, Neon Green, and white strobe lights that went to the beat of the double bass drums. It was cool. The other bands were good to. The lead singer of 36 Crazy Fist stage dived into the crowd and let the crowd sing. It was awesome! I will have pics of the concert soon.

        I have a lil' bro by the name of Zach. He is real annoying, but today I have to reflect on all the good things we have done together. We have done some crazy shit man... Like light the hill on fire! LOL. Today is Friday the 30th of July and he going in to the docs so they can diagnose my bro for a heart disorder. He may need heart surgery, but I am hoping for the best. As much of a lil' shit he is if anything happened to him I don't know what I would do! You besta take care MoFo!

      &nbsp;       Yeah... What can I say? Girls in Korea like to make it look like there assets are peeking out of there pants... Weird. Although my mom thinks that the assets are printed onto the skirt; Sarah and I think that they are really mesh holes exposing there butts... Look at how the butts match perfectly with the legs... Is it a conspiracy or do there assets really hide beneath the fake ones printed upon there butts? Go to Korea and find out for yourself.  Kogal    um... Right... If the point was to look like a crazed fan of another bleached out Korean R&B singer then your on your way there, but if you were trying to look like another Penny Wise(Clown from IT) disciple... Well then you got a while till that happens. This is a sick world!  KOGAL Style

      Well... I came to this conclusion recently because of some odd events. First I thought my mom was being cool about buying my condoms for me, but now she wants to invest into getting Sarah on birth control! Well it isn't that it is a bad idea, but the thought kinda freaks me out. Sarah thinx it is a good idea, but it is weird comin from my mom. We don't to have to rely on my mom for such a thing and hiding it is another problem and keeping up with taking them with school and work... It could be quite the hassle. She has been acting very weird though recently. Our van broke down the other day and she has been freaking out about how I need to stay home because we could be having a family emergency even though by lil' sis and bro are hangin with there friends and I wouldn't be of any help. Just odd...

      Once upon a time there was a girl and a guy who were really horny! They thought about what they could do when the guy asked if they could try to 69. The girl unwillingly said, "Fine... But you have to be on top!". As things started to heat up something bad happened, and no... A parent didn't walk in on them... It was far worse! The girl who must have been feeling so much pleasure that a little bubble in her tummy move up through her bowels. As she began to approach her climax she let out a little climax of her own from her butt! Yes she farted right in his face! Oh, but it doesn't stop there. There is such a thing as karma... yes they did 69 again, but this time the dude let out his own roar. yup, he farted right back in her face... lol. What irony.

      I don't like Bush... I don't like Bush at all. He sux! I personally am a democrat. I hang with people who are liberal, hippies from the green house. I don't mind them, but Bush gave republicans a really bad name! If you wanna know what I mean then go see Fahrenheit 911. Once you see what that dumb shit has done you will see were I am coming from. In that movie it shows how we shouldn't have fought Iraq over weapons of Mass Destruction, because we are the ones who gave them the nukes! Bush... You dumb shit.

      Although many of you probably go off bragging about your new girl friend or boyfriend to your parents my girlfriend Sarah likes to keep it from her parents so they don't get involved. I didn't think we would ever get caught, but her pops caught us today. I had my arms on her and she was holding my sides when he busted in with a big "Hey!". I was startled and my partner was worried that he had caught us in the act of kissing. Thank god he didn't, but I feel this will the be the cause of my demise. I hope he will still like me(That is if he even did in the first place). I look back now I realize that it was quite funny.

         I've come to the conclusion that there is no innocence left in the world!  Josh is boinking his girlfriend-yeah, they're both too young...sixteen...I guess I'm just getting old. I look at her and she's so sweet and cute... and I just want yell at Josh to 'leave her alone you penis-driven freak'!  Thank god, that Pat gave me some good advice last year.   He said 'give Josh condoms now and tell him to keep them in his drawer, then when he needs more he can just tell you that he needs more and you will both know he is 'active' without having to go into an embarassing conversation about it".   I took this advice and bought the box of condoms for Josh to keep in his drawer. About three months passed...nothing.   Then they had a school dance.   A couple of days later Josh came to me. "I lost my condoms, can you get me some more?" "You   lost    your condoms"? "Yeah, I had them in my wallet and Todd and David found them and started throwing them at each other." "Well, these are not cheap you know. I bought them for one thing only...so don't go letting your friends play with them again." "OK, I won't let my friends play with them again."  A week later..."Can you get me some more condoms?" "Why, did your friends   lose    them again?" "No...so...can you get me some more condoms?" "Sure I'll pick up some on my way home from work tomorrow."  End of Conversation.

      Today Aug, 9th was the first day of school... I got some pretty cool teachers like Mr.Housely. He is funny as shit!He cracks a lot of wise ass jokes, but oddly enough I am his favorite student in the class. He said, "I don't know any of you little brats... Wait! I do know one of you...". He points to me. "You are the one guy who is always with my little Sarah! You are cool in my book..." He was like I need to give someone in this class a nick name... No one raised there hands... So he looks at me and says, "You are now J-Unit...". So there. I am J-Unit now. I only saw Sarah 2 times today! We had one class together and then saw each other after school ended... I for a while thought she was avoiding me.  Turns out it was just a hectic day and she couldn't find me for awhile. It's ok though because now I have her schedule. We don't have lunch together this year... :-( That really sucks, but we both have an evil bitch of a teacher by the name of Ms.Aronin. She is evil. She asked me if I worshiped Satan then bitched because I pasted out in her class. Everyone else was cool though. I had some home work, but finished it in am matter of minutes. That is all for today... Thanx for your time.

      Yup... Today is August 1st... I don't wanna go back to school yet. Summer wasn't long enough for my taste! Fucken summer school. Took my whole damn vacation! Today I gotta go in and do all the gay shit like pay for a locker that I will probably use once. Only thing I am looking forward to is hangin with Sarah at school and wrestling. Nothing else seems to really appeal to me. Well maybe orchestra. I'll think about that one.

      Today Sarah and I saw The Village. It was not what it was cut out to be... At all! It was a good movie, but I just wasn't satisfied with it... You know. They made it sound really good when it was not the best M. Night movie. What else can I say?

      Well lately I have been hearing a lot about suicide from a lot of people(especially from the punk and emo kids). They all seem to act like they have it so bad with all there issues with there parents and there painstaking lives in there $100,000 houses. I mean really! You don't even have it bad. Just because your peeps caught you beaten your monkey doesn't mean you have to kill yourself. Then the next problem is how they do it and what happens after. They always cut there wrists and may I say those are always scratches if I ever saw one. Then they turn around and brag about how depressed they are and show off there wounds like there were some kind of new fashion. Really! Wow that is soooo cool... Not! If you really want to die then you would realize you are trying to end your suffering... Then why would you go through the pain of bleeding to death from a slit in your arm? If you really are gonna kill yourself, then shoot yourself in the head. There you will die quick and easy... Just like you wanted. Really you should look at it like Sarah does... "Be glad you are even alive!". Every individual has some kinda special characteristic that makes them special. Take this advise and do what you will with it... Don't kill your self! Finally I said it. lol.

      I am working for a man named Rob who owns a restoration clinic for cars like old mustangs. We restore all kinds of cars. I worked for him in the past, but he did some dirty business with my parents(charged them for a bad job twice) so I quite and now they are closing down. I get paid $15 bucks for 3 hours of work. Not bad, but I still get to finish up some of the old projects I never got to finish. It was pretty fun, but Taco Bell will pay better.
