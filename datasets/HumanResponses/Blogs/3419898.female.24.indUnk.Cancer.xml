      To start something always seems to be so difficult for me... duh. Like doing up this web log. I'm a newbie... so it really took me some time to be able to figure out some of the functions and stuff ya. I don't even know how to create a post a week ago! Finally... starting to get something out here :)   I want to do so many things with this! Like adding links, pictures, messages boards, chatterbox (I thought I saw something like this in a website), do up my own nice blog design, add icons... blah blah blah...   Haha... how well would I do all the above, we'll see :)

      One blow isn't enough. It's not only good things that come in pairs, bad things do too.  These few days have been nerve-wrecking. I've been checking the snail mailbox several times a day, over and over again... for a letter which I thought will never come. And today, it did.  The letter of rejection from university.  ARGHHH.................!!!  Initially I was quite confident of myself. Until 2 weeks ago, I thought I wasn't so sure. I began drafting my appeal letter. I checked my smail mailbox 3 times a day. I chanted to myself repeatedly, "A big envelope... a big envelope... a big envelope..." (I heard from my friends the uni will send a big envelope for acceptance, a small one for rejection).  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *   6.02pm. 7/6/2004. Monday.  As usual, I opened my snail mailbox. I saw a SMALL white envelope...  "We appreciate the time and effort you took in applying to us....., we have no choice but to deny GOOD APPLICANTS LIKE YOU a place at our university..."   CUT THE CRAP!  I thought there's not need for such sacarcity when rejecting people ya.   I mean, ok... I admit. I regretted not putting in enough effort during my poly years... that's why I got rejected.  At least, there's one thing I didn't regret doing.   My appeal letter drafted has not been wasted.  Sigh. End of a beautiful day, signifies the START OF A BAD DAY...

      Start of a very beautiful day!  I was in a very mood this good morning. Woke up early, had my breakfast, read the papers, surf the net.  Ooh... Drizzling. I strolled slowly to my bike, put on my raincoat and rain-pants... lalalalala... Humming to my favorite tunes.  Although it was raining, and with the usual morning peak traffic, my mood wasn't dampened. Well, I haven't had a good night's rest for quite a while. It was the first time I have slept without distubance in 2 weeks :) Where did the crickets go last night? Wherever they went, PLEASE... DON"T COME BACK AGAIN.  Reached my office already. Dry, cool and nice, despite the rain. My favorite parking lot was available. Great. Everything just went so smoothly for me.  I got down my bike. As usual, held the brakes and fit my right foot steadily on the main-stand...  ARGGHHHHHHH..................!!!  *TRANCE*  For a split of a second, I found myself leaning on my bike. My palms were scratched and I nearly hurt my head. I quickly picked myself up and lifted my bike...  ARGHHHHHHHH..................!!!  SCRATCHES. I found SCRATCHES on my bike. I FOUND SCRATCHES ON ALL OVER THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY BIKE!!!   Damned it. Shouldn't have worn slippers today.  Sigh. End of a beautiful day.

      Never thought I'll have to blog on my mobile... Forgot my hardcopy of B.O.T... What to do... I'm such a duh. Well, at least I found another option to note down my thoughts...   I just L.O.V.E my mobile :)  I just realised I've got only 2 cigarettes left... Still another hour to go before I attend class.  What to do... I'm just a duh ya.                 Not only I'm a duh, I'm also a lazybum. The petrol kiosk is just in front of me and I don't even bother to take a less-than-20-metres walk to get my cigarettes.   Ok ok... I'll stop grumbling. I'll just smoke less... That's all :)  I saw on tv the other day about this quit smoking campaign. I remembered 3 months ago, I promised myself I'll quit smoking... And I nearly succeeded. Damned the devil...  I'm just tempted. I told myself... just one stick... just ONE. And guess what? (Don't bother... I guess you've guessed it)  It's actually not that difficult to quit. It's all in the mind. Conquer the devil and taa daa!! I'm successful! Hehe... For only 2 weeks. I'm always finding excuses for myself. Telling myself I can quit easily, anytime. So it's all right. I can do it. The truth is... Mission impossible.   Time-out. I'll be back in a minute.                                 *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  * Got myself a packet of cigarettes. Am I glad!! Cigarette price went down by a dollar!!!   Sigh... Look at what I've just said. I think I can't live without SMOKING... Mission IMPOSSIBLE.   Excuses. That's just something man uses to make themselves feel better. I found myself using too much excuses. It's not real at all. After I finished 'excusing'' my faults, it is hello to reality again. If there're no sins, no wrongs, there'll be no need for excuses...   What to do... I'm a duh...

      From far, I could see a small white barrier wall that covered the stall. No more chairs. No more tables. No more familiar faces.  My favorite place has closed it's doors for good...  Marine Parade Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  I always thought it will be there for as long as I do. For the past 4 years, I've been going there very often to log my B.O.T (Book of thoughts). It's MY place. I knew the staff there well. I see familiar faces there for drinks. Noisy kids running out from the tuition centres. I watched shops started their business around there and closing down. Finally... it is it's turn.  What am I to do? Felt quite lost there ya...  When I begin my entries in my B.O.T, it's always begins with something like " Me at kopi beanie again...", "I'm at my favorite kopi beanie..."... blah blah blah and stuff. Arghh... where am I going to find a favorite place again!  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  I scouted around the area and decided to find another prospective favorite place. Hahaa!   I seated comfortably at this Haagen Daz cafe. I took out my B.O.T and pencil, ordered a cuppucino... and stared in blank space. Half an hour later, I zoomed off... without any entries.  I guess still needed some time to get used to my new "favorite" place.  I hate losing things. Especially when you have been so used to that lifestlye. I hate changes. It means I've to get used to everything all over again. I hate myself. For being so inflexible...

       urlLink      A Rainbow    I took this outside my office quite some time ago. I love rainbows. It feels so happy, so cosy, so... lucky. There was once when I encountered a double rainbow, one above the other. And there was other time, I actually got to touch one!      The Rainbow Connection       Why are there so many, songs about rainbows      And what's on the other side      Rainbows are visions, but only illusions      And rainbows have nothing to hide      And so we've been told and some choose to believe it      I know they're wrong, wait and see        &nbsp;    Someday we'll find it      The Rainbow Connection      The lovers, the dreamers and me        &nbsp;    Who said that every wish, would be heard and answered      When wished on&nbsp;the morning star      Somebody thought of that, and someone believed it      And look what it's done so far      What's so amzing, that keeps us star gazing?      What do we think we might see?        &nbsp;    Someday we'll find it      The Rainbow Connection      The lovers, the dreamers and me        &nbsp;    All of us under it's spell      We know that it's probably magic        &nbsp;    Have you been half-asleep, and have you heard voices?      I heard hem calling my name      Is this the sweet sound, that calls the young sailors?      The voice might be one and the same      I've heard it too many times to ignore it      It's something that I'm supposed to be        &nbsp;    Someday we'll find it      The Rainbow Connection      The lovers, the dreamers and me        &nbsp;    (By Kermit the Frog)

       We had a small debate in the office the other day.     It all started when Jen told us about her friend, who's a teacher, and the big misdeeds which the little ones committed.  &nbsp;

      To Sen,  I was surprised when you called last evening. When I heard your voice, I knew it was you. It's a voice I wouldn't forget this lifetime...  I still remembered when we last contacted each other. It was amicable. We promised we aren't supposed to know each other anymore... we were supposed to be strangers.  We met up. We didn't speak a word. You held my hands and brought me to our favorite place. I never imagined we would be there together again. We sat side by side,humming and singing our favorite tunes, just like the good old times.  I wanted to ask you so many things... How are you? Is your studies tough? Have you toured the whole of Australia yet? ... ... ... Why have you come for me again?  I didn't know what came over me. I couldn't speak. I just gazed at you... The same Sen, the same smile you wear, the same you I used to know...  Just then, I heard you hummed the song... OUR SONG...  今生不再  多得这雨势将烟花扑毁， 才令我体会凡事会枯萎 多得这刹那不小心脱轨， 遗憾才会令你珍惜得彻底  同度过这盛世，随手都采到星火的美丽 但我怎知道这份执迷抱入来世， 仍在你躯体  就趁那歌声悠扬 玻璃倒影了今生不再的幻象 天空正挂着今世最亮的月亮 蜚短流长 未来将怎样设想  恨这晚歌声悠扬 当中多少秒终可跟最爱来分享 种种恩恩爱爱 可伸展多少世代仍在唱  种种恩恩爱爱 不可多得的美丽但无常 怎么可设想  I hugged you so tightly I sweared I wouldn't want to let go even if it would cost my life. Tears welled from my eyes... I wasn't supposed to love you anymore, but I didn't care.  "Is this a dream?" I asked.  You smiled at me and spoke your first sentence.  "No. I've come back for you this time. We will never leave each other again ok?"  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  *  *  * I woke up and realised my pillow was soaked with tears.  During my journy to work this morning, I asked myself so many questions until I was so confused.  For so many times, I have tried so hard to let you go. In the end, I realised I was just fooling myself all along. I can decieved myself, my family and my friends, but I could never run away from my subconscious. I always thought I have managed to throw you and the memories far away. In my dream, I was true to my feelings, myself and you.  I guess I'm still loving you, even until today. I will never be able to let you go this lifetime.  Love, Niz
