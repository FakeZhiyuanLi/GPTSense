      Over the mountain take me across the sky Something in my vision, something deep inside Where did I wander, where do you think I wandered to I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now I told them I had ridden shooting stars And said I'd show them how Over and over always tried to get away Living in a daydream only place I had to stay Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide People around me talking to the walls inside I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now I told them I had ridden shooting stars And said I'd show them how Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free Over and under in between the ups and downs Mind on a carpet magic ride goes round and round Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds Watching my body disappear into the crowd

      Oh no, oh no Here we go now Oh no, oh now Here we go now Got a crazy feeling I don't understand' Gotta get away from here Feelin' like I should have kept my feet on the ground Waitin' for the sun to appear Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something that I enjoy' Cause you can't see what my eyes see (I can see it, I can see it) And you can't be inside of me Flying high again I can see trough mountains, watch me disappear I can even touch the sky Swallowing colours of the sound I hear Am I just a crazy guy (you bet) Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something that I enjoy If you could be inside my head You'd see that black and white is read Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Come on and join me Flying high again Flying high againFlying high again Come on and join me Oh no, oh no Here we go now Oh no, oh now Here we go now Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand  Never saw inside my head. People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand Never heard a thing I said Mamma's gonna worry I've been a bad, bad boy No use sayin' sorry It's something I enjoy Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again Flying high again

      They couldn't see what I thought would be so obvious  They hide behind the laws they made for all of us  The ministry of truth that deals with pretense  The ministry of peace that sits on defense  I'm washing my hands of what they're trying to do  It's for me, it's for me, it's for you, it's for you  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebelI'll tell you no lies  They say I worship the devil  They must be stupid or blind  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  They live a life of fear and insecurity  And all you do is pay for their prosperity  The ministry of fear that won't let you live  The ministry of grace that doesn't forgive  Do what you will to try and make me conform  I'll make you wish that you had never been born  Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  I'll do what I please  Yes I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  And I'm as free as the breeze  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  They'll try playin' win your heart  They know it rules your head  If they could read between the lines  You know they'd see the real day  God only knows why they couldn't see the obvious  Is it because they manifest the incubus  The ministry of war that got caught in the draft  The ministry of joy that still hasn't laughed  When it's all boiled down and the day's at an end  I'll give you no bullshit and I'll never pretend  Cause I'm a rock 'n' roll rebel  I'll tell you no lies  They say I worship the devil  Why don't they open their eyes  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel  A rock 'n' roll rebel  I'm just a rock 'n' roll rebel

      Well, I know I could be just another stranger But to you I guess I'm just another fool And you swear you like to live your life in danger Then you hide behind a wall of silly rules Nobody thinks the way I do I guess that nobody dares Your head's so full of things So set your mind free of them I'm breaking the rules Did you know that in the truth there's nothing stranger? I suppose you think I think I know it all Nobody hears the things I sayI guess that nobody cares My head's so full of things I set my mind free of them I'm breaking the rules Breaking all the rules Can't you see they're nothing without you? Empty heads full of fools Now you see, I'm breakin' all the rules (breakin' all the rules) Well, I know that you would love to go to heaven But you know that you're just too afraid to die And I know that you would love to know the answers But to you the truth is just another lie Nobody hears the things I sayI guess that nobody cares My head's so full of things I set my mind free of them I'm breaking the rules Breaking all the rules Can't you see they're nothing without you? Empty heads full of fools Now you see, I'm breaking all the rules (breaking all the rules)

      Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mindPeople think I'm insane because I am frowning all the timeAll day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfyThink I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacifyCan you help me, occupy my brain?Oh yeah!I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't findI can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blindMake a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cryHappiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unrealAnd so as you hear these words telling you now of my stateI tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

      Mr. Crowley, what went on in your head?Oh, Mr. Crowley, did you talk to the dead? Your life style to me seemed so tragic With the thrill of it allYou fooled all the people with magic Yeah, you waited on satan's doorMr. Charming, did you think you were pure? Mr. Alarming, in nocturnal rapport Uncovering things that were sacredManifest on this Earth Conceived in the eye of a secret And they scattered the afterbirth Mr. Crowley, won't you ride my white horse? Mr. Crowley, it's symbolic, of course Approaching a time that is classic I hear that maiden's call Approaching a time that is drastic Standing with their backs to the wall Was it polemically sent l want to know what you meant I want to know, I want to know what you meant, yeah

      Infinite dreams I can't deny them Infinity is hard to comprehend I couldn't hear those screams Even in my wildest dreams  Suffocation waking in a sweat Scared to fall asleep again Incase the dream begins again Someone chasing I cannot move Standing rigid nightmare's statue What a dream when will it end And will I transcend?  Restless sleep the minds in turmoil One nightmare ends another fertile Getting to me so scared to sleep But scared to wake now, in too deep  Even though its reached new heights I rather like the restless nights It makes me wonder it makes me think There's more to this I'm on the brink It's not the fear of what's beyond It's just that I might not respond I have an interest almost craving But would I like to get too far in?  It can't be all coincidence Too many things are evident You tell me you're an unbeliever Spiritualist? Well me I'm neither But wouldn't you like to know The truth Of what's out there to have the proof And find out just which side You're on Where would you end in Heaven or In Hell?  Help me. Help me to find my true Self without seeing the future Save me, save me from torturing Myself even within my dreams  There's got to be just more to it Than this Or tell me why do we exist I'd like to think that when I die I'd get a chance another time And to return and live again Reincarnate, play the game Again and again and again

      There's a darkened sky before me There's no time to prepare Salvage a last horizon But no regrets from me  Maybe I'll be back some other day To live again just who can say In what shape or form that I might be Just another chance for me  A hurried time no disgrace Instead of racing to conclusion And wishing all my life away No-one can stop me now  Time is up it couldnt last But there's more things I'd like to do I'm coming back to try again Someday maybe I'll wait till then  No more lies No more lies No more lies No more lies  They're all sitting at my table Talking tall and drinking wine Their time is up just like me But they just dont know it yet  So just a word of warning When you're in your deepest dream There's nothing you can hide from I've got my eye on you  The clock is fast the hour is near Eventful past is everclear My life is set the time is here I think I'm coming home  No more lies No more lies No more lies No more lies  A hurried time no disgrace Instead of racing to conclusions And wishing all your life away No-one can stop me now  Time is up it couldnt last But there's more things I'd like to do I'm coming back to try again Someday maybe I'll wait till then  No more lies No more lies No more lies No more lies No more lies

      When a person turns to wrong  Is it a want to  be, belong?  Part of things at any cost  At what price a life is lost   At what point do we begin  Fighter spirit a will to win  But what makes a man decide  Take the wrong or righteous road   There's a thin line between love and hate  Wider divide than you can see between good and bad  There's a grey place between black and white  But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes   We all like to put the blame  On society these things  But what kind of good or bad  A new generation brings   Sometimes takes just more than that  To survive be good at heart  There is evil in some of us  No matter what will never change   I will hope  My soul will fly  So I will live forever  Heart will die  My soul will fly  I will live forever   Just a few small tears between  Someone happy and one sad  Just a thin line drawn between  Being a genius or insane   At what age begin to learn  Or which way out we will turn  There's a long and winding road  And the trail is there to burn   There's a thin line between love and hate  Wider divide than you can see between good and bad  There's a grey place between black and white  But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes   I will hope  My soul will fly  So I will live forever  Heart will die  My soul will fly  And I will live forever   There's a thin line between love and hate
