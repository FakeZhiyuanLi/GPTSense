      *looks very relieved at not being the only one to ramble* &nbsp; Brava! Well done, Madison! Brava! (notice the "brav a"  not "brav o " lol, theres sumthin i learned at camp!) &nbsp; Ok! &nbsp; okay, today i woke up around 12-1 (which is early for me) and then i immeadiately went to the computer, when my friend IMed me on aim and asked if i wanted to go to barnes and nobles (where we always go and hangout, not to mention be loud, annoying, and play hide-and-seek, lol) so we planned to meet with some other friends, then i was gonna take a shower, but i got distracted by this fanfiction story i was reading, and then took a shower 2 hours later, and then i got back on the computer&nbsp; and kept reading (my poor eyes) until my mom came where i read for another hour, then got ready to go out to eat in five minutes and then left to  Sea Island  a nice resturaunt, where i had, ironically, chicken and salad, instead of seafood, and then from there my parents dropped me off at barnes and nobles but it so happened to be 30 minutes early than intened, so i finally found where the J.R.R.Tolkien stuff was and started reading  The Silmarillion  until my friends got there where we then proceeded to laugh about somthin that happened almost a year ago until our stomachs hurt and we&nbsp; laughed&nbsp; until no sound came out, and i think it really annoyed the heck out of some people who were trying to read (hey, we really did try being quiet, but it didnt work)&nbsp; then after about two and a half hours later (we were leaving at 10:30) my dad came to pick me up, so i was going to try to convince my dad to try and by me the book  The Silmarillion,&nbsp;  being the  poor &nbsp;Tolkien fan I am, but that failed and so i came home and i got on the computer reading more stories online, intil now when I decided to ramble on about my day as I just did. &nbsp; Voila! A nice&nbsp;medium sized &nbsp;ramble, if I do say so myself, lol.

      Okay, so as Admin, i will put in my rambling post for this month. Here we go...  I got up this morning at 11 or so, feeling very tired because i went to bed around 2 last night. Anyway, my pop had the decency to buy me a banana nut muffin from ensteins, the best ever, so i had that and some fruit salad for breakfast... yum! Then, boredom ahead, i locked in on the computer and putted around on iChat and worked on some Blog preferences (aka, wasted time). Just when my eyes were begining to sink into my head from starting at my computer, my pop yelled at me to get a social life. So, with nothing else to do, i called friends... all busy. I yelled back up that i had lost it and would let him know once it was found. And found it was. A few minutes later and old friend called and i was off to her house to go swimming. She has the coolest pool. 3 hours of chatting and catching up. We hadn't seen each other in a year... or at least that seems right. Anyway, my pop picked me up in time to head to karate class, much to my chargin. I hadn't been in a month (because of camp) and so i knew i was going to get a beating. Deciding there was nothing for it, i went without complaint.  Class was painful, but i survived! Unfortunetly, my teacher informed me i was also going to be taking the Wednesday Night class, which whas the 30 min longer adult class ONTOP of the jounior black belt class i was currently taking on Thursday. Ugggg, it's not going to be pretty. After class, my teacher told me i was becoming a lady, and this new guy in the adult class after us said that he would hate to be my date! It was all it could do not to burst. Anyway, i shall save you from any more gruesome details of karate by moving right on past fast food dinner at Crazy Bowls and Wraps, straight into watching The Mask of Zoro with my little 10 year-old sister. Wow; what an interesting movie. That's all i shall say. (The main guy is supposed to be hot, but really comes closer to mangy and greasy). Oh well.  That concludes my rambling session (although i doubt many of you read to the end), and i wish you a good sleep if i put you into such condition. Otherwise, please post your own rambling at this time.   best wishes, madi
