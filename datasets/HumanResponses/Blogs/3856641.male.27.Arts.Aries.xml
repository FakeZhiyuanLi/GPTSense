      MUSIC:&nbsp; Radiohead -  The Bends  MOOD:&nbsp; Exhausted and Wired  Okay, so I've seriously been addicted to   urlLink The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker   lately.&nbsp; It's not funny how much I've been into it, but it's a fact of life.&nbsp; I told someone the other day that I didn't want to start it because&nbsp;I didn't have the time to play a stupid game that was going to monopolize my time.&nbsp; I was told "it's not a pet!"&nbsp; That person doesn't play the v-games.  Looks like things are looking up for Camp Booze.&nbsp; The price went up, but it looks like it's just going to be a little less crowded than we expected.&nbsp; A cabin in Canaan Valley should be an interesting time.&nbsp; Video game systems have been outlawed.&nbsp; We will have cards and we will be playing Texas Hold-em, I guarantee that.&nbsp; Oh yes, we will be playing.&nbsp; Study-up now, assholes, cuz I'm comin' atcha full force.  Word association time.  Boobies. Milk. Cattle.  I'm stuck.

       urlLink My Cat Hates You   Look.  We all know that cats hate people but are total moochers.  They rub on your just for you to change their crapping boxes or feed their food-to-poop converters.  Finally, a website that proves what all of us have been thinking.

      Sex in the City on TBS is just plain wrong.&nbsp; I mean wrong.&nbsp; And I think I know someone that agrees with me...   urlLink   Is it really that wrong?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; [At a church] "We'll get there...&nbsp; we just have to have a little  faith ."&nbsp; *Puke*  It seems like everyone in my life is sick in one way or another.&nbsp; That includes myself on Monday.&nbsp; Taking sick days at work are annoying.&nbsp; Some people have sore throats.&nbsp; Some people are going to doctors.&nbsp; I want to say something clever right here, but the sound of that damn TV show in the background is really playing with my brain...  ...in ways I've never known could be possible.&nbsp; Is it epilepsy?&nbsp; Is it the sickness from earlier this week?&nbsp; I feel like I could get in a fight with Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Ho-bag and LOSE.&nbsp; That's right, there clothing would distract me and they would burst my ears with conversation filled with irony and puns.&nbsp; Puns.&nbsp; I'm feeling nauseous.  Let me think...&nbsp; Oh yes!&nbsp; We have Camp Booze coming up soon, don't we?&nbsp; Let's pray that we rally&nbsp;the troops and more people don't back out.  Speaking of backing out, if I see Carrie break up with Mr. Big one more time, well, then I guess that means that I'm  urlLink watching  this next week, too, huh?

      MUSIC: Soundgarden -  Down on the Upside   MOOD: Kinda hungover  BEVERAGES OF THE EVENING:&nbsp;Corona Extra, Bud Light, Miller Lite, Vodka and Tonic, Bombay Sapphire Gin and Tonic,     You feel 10 years too young to be in here? Why? Because Margaret Thatcher is over there having a good time?  -- Brian Leone on the crowd at Coyote Ugly in DC    Starting with the fact that my ATM card's magnetic strip no longer exists on most of the card in my wallet and getting physical cash was&nbsp;impossible.&nbsp; Evidently, it's impossible for stores to run an ATM card manually as a debit card transaction for cash back.&nbsp; That would have been helpful knowledge 24 hours ago.   Wow. What an interesting night. That's the easiest way to describe it, I guess. Interesting. Last night, my friends and me were really trying to give our buddy, Aaron, a great time for his bachelor party. Only problems were, in my opinion--and how can I put this delicately...    BACHELOR PARTY RULE #1:  Only invite your very bestest and closest friends.   Don't get me wrong, everyone there were pretty cool dudes for the most part. But when people, who ARE NOT the bachelor, are getting sick and throwing up in alleys and falling asleep at tables by the second bar of the night... well then we have a problem. It's hard to have a show Aaron a good time when you are babysitting and wrangling up disrespectful assholes.    BACHELOR PARTY RULE #2:  Don't invite more than 10 people who fit RULE #1.   It's gonna be a rough night. That's a given. The delusion of responsibility of showing the bachelor a good time dwindles to nothing-per-person. Who's job is it to keep everyone/everything on track? When you have 18 people and someone tells you that the group is leaving, then you leave or get left. HOWEVER, if someone who is just not having a good time and isn't man enough to suck it up and hang out for the bachelor's sake (who was having a great time)... Wow I'm really pissed.    BACHELOR PARTY RULE #3:  The Best Man (or other designee) is in charge   Too many chiefs and not enough injuns will get any situation into a spiral of testoserone-filled cock fights. Mine's bigger! NO WAY! I can't fit mine into a 2 Quart can of baked beans! He says when you stay, he says when you go, he says where we are going next. Input is welcome, but if he declines it, then fucking tough. Wow. Still pissed about this one, too.    BACHELOR PARTY RULE #4:  Call ahead to every place that you plan on going that night.   We brought a large guarantee to any business that the group that is about to arrive at their club is going to spend an assload of money. Deals are available for such groups. However, they need notification of the event and the group size. We went to a normally-classy place in DC (yes, it was a strip club--great, now I can't run for office). But when I walk in the door (second to last in line) with 17 other guys to find out that I have to pay $20 for my admission... Well... I'm not happy. Consider that the last time I was there a couple of months ago for another friend's bachelor party we got in for the price of $ZERO and we had 10 people or so.   Let's do the math: 18 people x $20/person = $360 for admission. That's&nbsp;fucked up. When we sat down at this long dance-table,&nbsp;all the girls swarm us.&nbsp;&nbsp;It became quite apparent that&nbsp;management had totally fucked up the operations of the club. We find&nbsp;out by several employees of the club--once we started complaining and refusing to pay for crap forced on us--that no one goes there anymore. $15 per shot? We're outta there. I don't want to point fingers or say don't go to this club, but don't. The club is called  urlLink Nexus  and it's located in southeast DC.&nbsp;My friends and I have scratched that place for all future bachelor events. I suggest you do the same. Period.    BACHELOR PARTY RULE #5:  The night is 100% for the benefit of the bachelor.   If you can't follow this rule. Don't go. It's just respect, asses.   BACHELOR PARTY RULE # 6 : Bear and Jeff should not be allowed to talk to one another.     He just compared Democrats to Socialists.&nbsp; That conversation has lost all coherency. --Mike Defede on Bear and Jeff's inane politics.  Thankfully, I think that Aaron had a really good time and we masked a lot of what was going on for him. Brian was doing a really good time of letting the specific assholes involved that they were not being cool. Sometimes I wish weren't as nice as we are and could have dumped some folks off at a taxi stand.   Whew! It may not sound like it, but all-and-all I had a really good time with some of my close friends.&nbsp; Aaron was in full force and seemed really happy that all his friends were there, so I suppose it was pretty successful.&nbsp; Hanging out on the back porch recapping the evening&nbsp;with Brian and Travis after everyone had fallen asleep in weird positions on couches, floors, and other peoples' beds.

       urlLink DecemberTeen Girl Squad   If you haven't seen Teen Girl Squad, then you don't understand summer fashions.  News flash, people, but summer is seriously on the brink of being over already.  That means that you are going to have to start wearing long pants and long skirts again...  Then how are you going to snare cute boys?  Good luck.  Seriously.  Good luck.  Don't you worry.  This ain't over yet.  Like rotten bananas, I'll be back in one way or another.

      MUSIC: Metallica -  Fade to Black   Dear Diary,  I'm really starting worry.  All the kids in class are going out with each other and I still haven't even kissed anyone. I'm ashamed to not be cool.  They made fun of my Jordache shoes again.  I could die.  But not really, cuz that would suck.  On another note, Suzie McMasters asked me for my number again.  She wants help with her science project and to get advice about Tad Dudley (who sucks a big one! Just kidding Tad).  I think she likes me.  Like a friend, not a boyfriend!  Plus, I'm not interested.  I should tell her that I've had a crush on her since second grade, but she'd probably call me a creep and stop talking to me.  Crap, I hope Tad doesn't read this.  Oh yeah, I forgot!  I got tickets to see C & C Music Factory at the  urlLink Ohio Valley College  auditorium!  I paid $15, so they better rock!  If you want to learn the words, go  urlLink here .  Gonna make you sweat!

      MUSIC: Jude -  No One Is Really Beautiful  MOOD: Yearnful  You can always tell--your eyebrows look sad-style and you just can't seem to get the lips in an upward position.  I'm not sad or depressed, just...  Well...  Bored.  If you can get up the nerve to just get out there and do it, then that makes you really ambitious, right?  So what does it mean when you can't seem to break out of your lightning-fast decision to just put it off until tomorrow.  I wouldn't call myself a procrastinator, really, well, kinda.  An interesting discussion I got into with Sara last night was about what drives a person to become an entertainer.  Is it ego?  Sure.  Is it a desire to be accepted?  Probably.  But here's the interesting question...  Why do some people perceive those people striving to be more than a bedroom balladeer as a braggart, a show off,  insert your own negative word here , etc.?  Sure, entertainers have to have some conceit to believe they are good enough for people to actually enjoy listening/watching their art.  But why are some shot down before they even get started?  I say let them get out there.  Support their desire.  The only thing that listeners/watchers can do is  be honest .  If they suck, don't tell them that your life has now changed from this moment on from their performance when in all actuality, you were in the bathroom for the whole second-half because their  art  induced rabid diarrhea.  Suck it up and tell them that your butt hurts because of their works and that you want your money back so you can pay for the expensive prescription drugs you are now going to be addicted to.  Which brings me to another point I'm extremely angry about.  Why in the hell do I know William Hung's name?!  Assholes.

      Music:  Whiskeytown -  Midway Park   Just to lead it off, my  urlLink friends  and I are heading off to the mountains of West Virginia for a little cabin get away a few weekends from now.  A few of my friends from my hometown (4.5 hours away) are excited for me to meet Jesus at the cabin.  I thought my friend may have become a born-again and the retreat was becoming more of a recruitment than a drunkfest.  Damn.  However, I was mistaken.  It is merely another guitar player with whom I'm supposed to "possibly combust."  I don't know what that means, but that's what I was told.  How was my  urlLink grammar  on that one?  You may have just witnessed the first time I've attempted to use "whom" in a sentence properly.  Actually, the reason I brought this up is because I had a flashback of when I was really young (probably age 6-8) I was at a church with a family friend and some stranger took me aside and asked me if I wanted to let Jesus into my heart.  I was totally freaked out, but I went along with it cuz I thought it sounded like a good idea.  He made me close my eyes and pray something.  When I re-opened my eyes, the freaky dude seemed pleased and let me go back to playing with the other kids.  I remember trying to  feel  Jesus in me--like a physical change or something.  The only thing I think I felt was a touch of paranoia that He might be watching me a little bit closer now that I gave him the key to the house.  Were they trying to brainwash me at the time?  Is that a normal church occurence?  I've asked around and no one seems to have gone through a similar experience.  Explanations?  Advice?

      Music: Ben Kweller's -  Sha Sha    So I've been running this website for a while now. Almost 3 years go by and I  finally  changed the freakin' look of it. As you can imagine, I'm freakin' tired. But I have one topic to address...   My name is all over this website. I'm trying to figure out a way to not make it so flagarant, but my ego just won't let me. I tried to get a rough estimate of how many times I say my own name, but I get confused.   Check out my nasty rough  urlLink music downloads  page and let me know what you think. I want to make an album, honest! Thanks for the patience, peeps!   Peace.

      Music: The Killers -  Somebody Told Me   Dear Diary,  Today I ran into Sally in 3rd period.  She said she liked my Metallica T-shirt and I said "thanks" and she laughed at me.  I think she's got a crush on me.  Either that, or there was a booger hanging from my nose.  Ugh!     My life is so complicated!  Tim wanted to know if I could play basketball with the guys after school but I told him that I was going to the Mall with my girlfriend.  He called me  pussy whipped .  I don't think he knows what that means because it sounds just fine to me!  I'm going to write poetry.    Black Hawk UP    Airplanes are stupid. Helicopters are hella coolz. You can't hover in an airplane. Utah Jazz rulez!!!  The End.

      Music: Pearl Jam -  Vs.   Okay, so I'm not one to get all nostalgic on my own, but when Pearl Jam popped up on the ole iPod, the pangs of a time in high school far far away really shot up my gut.  A few of my friends have completed college lately and I feel sad all over again.  You miss your friends.  Even the ones that you only went to their room because they had substances (alcohol, etc.) that you didn't have the access to (or you sucked at talking the 35-year-old gas station attendant in believing you were 21+).  Ah, memories.  Oh wait...  ... I had to study back then.  I had to spend my evenings dreading the fact that I hadn't read the assignment for tomorrow.  Yeah, I still have those dreams/nightmares every now and then, but isn't it totally worth that feeling of waking up knowing that you actually DON'T have to worry about school anymore?  Oh wait...  ... It all gets replaced by something in your life.  Work.  Kids.  Money.  Money.  Eh.  Money.  *Steps off soap box*  How about I just talk about getting naked and writing music?  Sorry.  Just miss my friends an awful lot.  They know who they are.  If you want to get to know them, my friend Alana keeps a journal of the crap they do on  urlLink Blog Spot  and it's rather entertaining...   urlLink Check it out .

      Music: The White Stripes -  There's No Hope for You Here   Wow.  I feel sweet.  There are a couple of moments when you feel the best and most clear.  #1:  If you get rid of a headache OR #2: After you've had sex.  You're just a caring and interesting person just waiting to listen.  If I had some advice for you, I'd put it right here.  Instead, I'm going to tell you that music is coming back.  Oh yes, it's coming...  and when it does...  Well, it's going to feel like one of those two things from up above.  Probably #2.  Much love.

      Music: Elliot Smith -  XO   Weird days spawn weird feelings. It's just a train wreck when you try to rationalize emotions. Blahedy blahepy. Different perspectives spawn different conclusions.   Okay, so that wasn't very deep and incredibly vague. I'm not one to leave the away message that says "I'm out with someone who WON'T stab me in the back and date my best friend" so I'll just drop it.   Spring cleaning at its finest today. With all that has happened, maybe I'll write. I've been such a slacker in that area lately that it's been kind of embarrassing. I still play every day, but I really can't seem to figure out where I'm trying to go with my ideas. Maybe I could hire a shirpa to clean out my brain with mumblings and chants of higher mountain thought. Then I can write about the beauties of bumble bees and how unnecessary clean socks are when you go barefoot.   Music is important. Music is sleeping. It  has  to blow up soon. It just has to... Doesn't it? Damn.    Hibernation in Fm     Bears are Bears. Fleas are fleas. Large and small. Quite eager to sneeze.   Achoo.

      Music: Faith No More -  Anne's Song   Whoa whoa whoa, crazy reader.  How's it shaken?  I'm fine, thanks.  I started thinking about how stir-fry is much like human behavior.  Think about it.  You take all the residue from your daily lives and they end up tasting like each other in the future.  Things are going great with me.  Wine is yummy and keeps the tummy happy.  If you need some recipes for stir-fry, let me know.   urlLink E-mail me .

It's oh-so-very interesting, I assure you * yawn *.  Lord.  When I downloaded this thing, the freakin' description said it was soooooo easy to use.  Anyway, things are going well with me.  I suppose that this will be the place to find out if you are curious in the future on my whereabouts and happenings.  Bed for now.  Ranting for later.

      MUSIC: Ben Kweller -  Sha Sha  (yes, again... shove it) MOOD: Ready for the Weekend  Thank God it's... I'm not going to say it out of principle. Is that the right principal/principle? You can write me and tell me otherwise, but I'm going to stick with my guns on this one.  Yes, it's Friday and I'm ready for the weekend. I'm heading off to Roman's wedding (you'll probably remember the bachelor party debacle ( urlLink click here for recap ). It's in  urlLink Morgantown, WV  or near there, anyway. It's going to be a long journey, but at least I'll get to see some friends that I haven't seen in a week. I sure do miss those dirty bastards from Camp Booze. Speaking of which, I still haven't posted those lovely Camp Booze pictures from my camera... I have a couple of pictures of not-happy people with their pants around their ankles and their bathing suit tops off. Nothing but towel, baby, nothing but towel. GRRRRROWL.  Well, if you made it this far into the e-mail, you're probably reading as to when I'm going to play again. I'll be opening for the  urlLink Steve Hussey Band  on September 11, 2004, at a small sports bar called "The Front Row" in Parkersburg, WV. You'll remember Steve from the whole Stuck On Amber project from a few years ago. We've both grown up in our directions... Awwww... how sad and cute at the same time. It'll rawk, don't you worry.  Wow. My neighbor is a freak. I was finger picking absolutely lightly in my room and she's pounding on the wall like I was jamming out and singing my ass off. I have a feeling there's going to be some falling outs going on once I get the studio up and running again. I will be producing whether she can take it or not so it should be pretty interesting. I'll keep you all posted. Good thing I'm renting... She's an owner. Bad side is that I'm stuck with  her .  I smell a showdown. *sniff sniff* Definitely.  Peace.

      MUSIC:  Elliot Smith - Figure 8  MOOD: Distraughtly Working  I'm starting to feel better from the debauchery that was Camp Booze. 3 Days of nothing but drinking can really make a person feel smart and refreshed once it all ends and you've gotten a full night's rest without insane nightmares about your girlfriend being swept out from under you by  urlLink Fred Willard . Boy, that dream had one weird explanation attached to it that morning. I mean, he's just  so damn convincing .  I want to go on more about Camp Booze, but I really don't have the effort in me right now, so check back tonight, and maybe I'll even have a picture or two from the hot tub of tit soup. Bear's eyes will never work the same after the weekend. Never again. Also, have you checked  urlLink Alana's  website for an update? I smell a worker bee who's too lazy after work to update with all the quotes from the weekend.  Ah yes, I met Jesus... He plays a mean hand at Texas Hold 'Em. That damned Jesus. He also never gets tired of the Jesus jokes, which is absolutely astounding. They just keep coming. I even found myself apologizing around Him. It was funny, but damn did that get kinda old in just 3 days. And to think to oneself, "Self, He has to deal with that on a daily basis."  I actually heard some of the weirdest words out of a pre-Graduate student looking for a way out of her current position. "I just keep praying that she'll fire me." That's weird. And for some odd reason, it kinda gets me excited. Not like that, you pervert... Or  am  I? Dump dum duuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhm.

       urlLink Todd's Trip . You gotta feel bad for Todd.  Well, we got back from Cincinnatti last night and boy, that was a fun trip. Lots o' driving and playing car games. I don't think I'll ever be able to think of another Celebrity who's name starts with a "P" or "D" ever again. I'm even almost sick of the music on my iPod, which I thought would never happen.  All and all it was a pretty good trip, but getting up at 4:30am after a bedtime of 12am isn't that much fun and you tend to bite your trip-mate over stupid things like spilling water on the wall. But the best part is that the job has been completed and a nice little trip to Pottery Barn Outlet. Yuppies unite! Together we can rid the world of bad decorating. Or maybe I'm an undercover agent for those who have no style... I just may be infiltrating the world of class without proper authorization from the Hiltons.
