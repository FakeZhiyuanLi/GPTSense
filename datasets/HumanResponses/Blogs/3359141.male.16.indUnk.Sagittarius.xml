      So I had my meeting yesterday with the doc. And holy shit was that awkward! I once again realized why I don't express my feelings out loud and usually stick to writing. So nothing got accomplished and I wasted a bunch of time. And then he gave me homework that i can't really do right now. So i bet he'll be really happy with me.  I'm in a lot of pain right now. Emotionally though...well physically too i guess. I don't understand why things always have to happen so damn shitty. But its nothin new really. But now im so so fucking sick of it. It just makes me want to die.   This is the best representation of my feelings right now  When you hurt so many people It just makes you want to cry And you take a look straight up And stare into the sky  You can see the faces Of some people who say they care But when it comes right down to it They are never there  When you're crying and hurting When you're happy as can be And you look to the sides of you And there is nothing you can see  Shouldn't they be here with me To help if i'm in need Or are all of you to wrapped up in you're lives Absorbing all the greed  Whenever you need a friend I am ALWAYS there Whenever you are lonely I'm your teddy bear  You've said before you need me Be there on your side But whenever it is i need you You get wrapped up in your pride  I dont need you as a friend Is all you have to say Not realizing all the trouble i put in To help get you where you are today  I hurt right now I need a friend And aren't Anywhere around How the hell do you do this  And toss me on the ground  I love you  I hate hate I need you as a friend  I want you to be here with me Until the very end  A friend is all i need now But no one is around So dont be surprised to see me Lying dead upon the ground  You all had your chance to help You had our chance to care But now the next time you need me There will be nobody there  -Wesley Allen 5/29/04  -wessle(maybe the last post)

      If you were in my position what would you do? Ok, here is the story. I've been really really depressed as anyone that knows me will tell you. And if they don't kno, i'm a good actor what can I say. Ok, so i've been really depressed and i kinda started cutting recently. And though through no fault of my own I have gotten caught.(damn deana) SO ya I have to go to see a crazy  doctor today. And i'm really really scared. So ya that's about all I have to say. If anyone has any insight please comment on this. I'm just confused and scared right now and I need....something...someone. But what does it matter. So ya i'm in class and my appoi9ntment is coming up soon so bye bye. -wessle

      Sometimes history class is fun. Today however is completely retarded. And by retarded I mean Brian and Steve are completely retarded. And now Jeremy is trying to find my blog and failing miserably. Mwahahahahahaha!!! We all hate him. Or at least I know I do. What a loser!! I think from now on I am going to write all of my of my entries in leet. If you don't know what that is get a clue. I will at this point begin to make fun of and bitch out anyone I choose. I hope you all enjoyed my normal english versions of my entries. And i know one person that will enjoy the leet version a little bit more.

      Well I suppose this is the end then. I at one point thought what we had was special. And you know what, it is. But I guess not special enough. I know that you are always gonna be there ofr me. I know you know I'll always be there for you. But it can't ever be the same. I'm so sorr ythings happened this way. But you of all people know that you can't stop your feelings. If I could things would be a lot different. And none of this would have happened.  I don't yet know that this is the end. I sure hope that it's not. But it sure feels like it. I guess we'll at least always be friends. Which is of course not a bad thing. Now that I think about all that has happened. I don't know that I would do anything differently. I guess that what happened is just because I'm me. I m more confused now than ever. Who knew trying to figure things out would end up like this. I know i didn't. This is not good-bye. And our notebook is still our notebook. Our memories are still our memories. And we are still friends til the end. But things are different now than they were before. I don't even know what is different yet. But something will be. Let's both hope it all works out for the better.  -Wessle

      As the title implies I don't know where to start. I hate dial-up i know this much right now. I can't get the program I want right now so I'm kinda pissed. I think AOL for me stands for "Always  off-line" cuz it never seems like i'm on. Everything is so damn  slow.   So we had to take another session of the  Mc-Ass  test today. HOW WONDERFUL!! God damn I hate this thing. But it was better cuz I was in a room today so I was kinda happy. And I don't think I failed completely todya either so it's all good i guess.  Sadly this is damn near all I have to say. Sorry faithful readers.(all one of you) I'll try to write more later.  -wessle

      Day number three of  Mc-ass  was today. And it was my favorite day yet!!! MATH!! Whoo-hoo!!! In case you can't tell I was being sarcastic. I bombed out completely on this. I might as well reserve my seat for next year cuz this is bad. I'm really bad at math and this doesn't help me think any better of myself, let me tell you. So I completely screwed this section up. And the whole while i got to sit in the HALL!! In case you didn't know, the hallway is for walking in. NOT for taking the test that determines if I graduate. Walking is what people like to do in the hallway. And when they are doing this they like to talk....A LOT! So every five fuckin minutes someone is walking down the hall whistling or talking to one of their friends. And they don't care that im takin this test. So I'm being interuppted and Ms. Labaire is yelling at them the whole time, which also doesn't help me out that much. It is very difficult to concentrate under these conditions. On top of the fact that i don't know the material anyway all adds up to a bad score. Thankfully they called my mom and she bitched them out about it and I think that I'm taking the remanider of the tests in the guidence office....AIR CONDITIONER!!! It's all good in my opinion.  So then we had about ten minutes of our first block class. Which was all good cuz we watched Kung Pow. I love movies that are dubbed over into english. Especially comedies with really bad voice acting. O god...it's so damn funny. Me and Kyle just sat and laughed. It was all good.  Then was a lunch I don't like at all. Shepard's Pie......shit on a plate in other words. It was nasty. I wanted to throw up just looking at the shit. SO it doesn't take a genious to figure out I didn't eat.  Third block, Health, was pretty bearable today. All we really did was laugh, and laugh, and laugh. Then we had to look up definitions of words. Words that all have a part in the female reproductive system. And there a lot of words I didn't know what thwey meant. Damn it was sad. But I did all my work and I got it all done. So I'm kinda happy.  And then there was English. This is such a damn joke.We don't ever do any work really. So I like that. We sat and "read". Which is short for,"Hey Kyle, let's annoy Ashton!!" SO we did. It was good. Bu she got mad sadly. So after a while we got tired of her yelling and such. SO we stopped, or at least I did, and she stopped as is her custom. Then I got called down to the office. I didn't know why. But I got down there and found out I was getting paid. YAY!!! I got my check and I was happy. Then I realized that Kyle had work and that he could cash the check for me. So he did and I got my money minus the money he needed for the paint. My Ps2 is gonna look sweet. I can't wait to see this thing. I'll post a pic when it's all done so you can see the masterpiece. It should be awesome. I'm hoping so. If not I can't change it back so id damn well better look cool. And don't forget I know where you live and sleep Kyle so if it don't look right I'm coming for you!!  Well my internet is acting gay now so I think I'm going to go now. Ya'll come back now ya hear??!!??  -Wessle

      Wesley Allen I Am  I am creative and defiant I wonder why everything tastes like chicken I hear stupid people I see stupid people I want to see the Red Sox win a World Series I am creative and defiant  I pretend to be friendly I feel like crying I touch the sky I worry about failing I cry when I see my friends in pain I am creative and defiant  I understand my music I say things I don’t always mean I dream about leaving my home I try to impress I hope everything turns out alright I am creative and defiant    The Light  There’s always a light At the end of the tunnel  No matter how dark That tunnel may be  The journey to the end May be grueling and difficult  But the prize is always worth The work you put in      Even though it may not seem it at the time  And on the way you lose friends and family Sometimes you even lose some pride  But in the end It’s all worth it  The journey may take longer than expected But the length isn’t what matters  The only thing that matters Is that you make it through to the end  No one knows what the prize is Until you reach it  It could be love, friendship Or even material objects  Trials, tribulations Love, loss  We all experience these It’s how we deal with them that matters  There is a light at the end of the tunnel  And when you find it You will know  By: Wesley Allen    					   Emotions  Being alone is something we fear It’s something that is almost daunting  It’s something that we’re all used to But at the same time we’re not  We all need to be loved, cared for And sometimes even hated as a test  As long as someone feels something toward us That’s sometimes all we really need  Loneliness Something I’m accustomed to  Not always physically But emotionally  Things happen for a reason Then why am I always left out  Outcast, thrown to the curb Just left alone  Why is it always me who gets screwed out of chances Thrown away by everyone, recovered by no one  When do I get a shot A chance, an opportunity  Who decided that I’d be the emotional rag doll Toyed with for a while, then thrown away when you’re done  Shunned emotionally, harassed physically Scarred spiritually  Who was it that decided that I would have Just enough patience and endurance to keep from losing it   Where does everyone get the nerve to screw me I’m just as good as you, just different  Different look, different sound, different demeanor Just because of that I am rejected, and you are welcomed with open arms  Just because I’m different I get no chances where others get two or three  I’m treated differently, less accepted by all And ridiculed by most  Not given a chance to show how I really am Ignored and passed up for opportunities  Shunned by a society that made me Even rejected by people who were friends  How this happens in a country where all men are created equal I don’t know  Excluded from routine activities of your kind Left out of groups and discussions  But made to fit your One size fits all world  Having to work twice as hard for credit  That others receive upon entrance  Made to entertain your curiosity While not being treated humanely  Stuck in situations that are difficult for you And near impossible to me  Not even left with a shred of dignity With one friend left in the world   Where do you draw the line When will the humiliation end  Is there a light at the end of the “tunnel” Is there some relief on the horizon  Is there any way to end it all  Without ending it all  How many times do I have to prove myself To a world of hypocrites and lowlifes  I don’t know  Loneliness, Love, Criticism... Life  You can’t have any without the others However far apart those periods may be  They’re all there  Maybe that’s why I’m not accepted I see things too clearly  I see what others cast shadows on I see what others are deaf to  I am a culmination of everything We hear, see, feel, and we touch  I am a little of everything And a lot of nothing  Loneliness is a feeling you get when You’ve risen above the norm  Comprehension is a result   No matter how many friends you have It can get you  Loneliness It’s an emotion  It’s not really physical or spiritual  If you’ve never felt it You will  If you have felt it You’ll feel it again  A continuing cycle Loneliness, Love, Criticism...Life  The only time it ends Is when you die  Right before that final moment You will understand my message  And until then I will be here  Alone in my mind Thinking about my true friends, lost loves, and times when it just wasn’t to be  My rejections And the person who’s always there without really being there  My influence And lost friend  You never knew him I hardly did myself   May we all Rest in Peace     Complications  Sometimes things happen for a reason Whether it’s good or bad  Almost all good things come to an end Though when they do we don’t understand why  I know the sadness and the pain all too well As we all do some day  But when the day comes  We are never ready, and can’t be  They say things get better with time And they do, but only to a point  Sometimes the feelings resurface When you don’t want them to  And when this happens You lose control  When all you wanted Was a hug, or to talk  They were there  But no longer  Sometimes things happen for a reason Whether it’s good or bad  This what you need to find out And when you do, the pain will slowly fade away  Wesley Allen   Well this is just some of my poetry. And if your just judging me on this you might think im kinda crazy. Youd be right.  -wessle

      As if you can't tell i hate fucking standardized tests. They piss me off so fucking much it's not even fucking funny. But this one is especially irritating. We need to pass the mother-fucker to graduate high school. What ar ethe people that make us do this thinking. I bet more than half of them are on drugs. Fuckin' assholes!! I hope you all die and go to hell....wait...if you went to hell then we would all be living together. Ok I hope you all die and go to osmewhere just as bad as hell and even more dangerous. Like Disneyland. Ya that'll work go there and rot for all eternity. BASTARDS!!!! Oh ya and for those of you who don't know my home life is hell. Which is why that is what my house is called. If you want a better explanation just ask.  So ya....today wasn't all bad tho. We did have to take that fuckin test. And I did almost collapse from back spasms. And I did have to spend a fair amount of time in the nurses office. But I still got to see my best friends today. Sam, Jess, Nicole, and I even got to spend some time talkin to Laura. Which is such a treat because we never get the chance to talk anymore. I miss the crazy library days and such. I hope we have class together next year. But ou're so much smarter than me we'll probably never have class together again. Oh well I'm just a lazy bastard anyway who wants to be friends with me.   So during the breaks of the test we got to hang out a little bit in the halls and talk to our friends. Which was where I ran into Nicole and Mike. We got yelled at so many times for inturrupting the classes. It was great. But it's a good thingfor me that every teacher in the school likes me. Or I'd get into a lot more trouble than I do. Which is none actually. I know I'm surprised too. But  don't get into trouble anymore. It's great though. I have found I get much more respect this way. So it's all good.  Health was HELL as always. But at least I could just walk around all day. Because of my back and all. So at least I wasn't too bored. I think I might have even did good on the paper we needed to do today. So that is kinda keeping me in a good mood for now. But it won't last. Never does. So I'll just let the good times roll. And I'll deal with the bad when they get here. So it wasn't all bad. I did good on some other stuff too so my grade may be going up a little bit. So the phone may be in my future. Whoo-Hoo!!  Ya and then I had english. And for those of you who don't know this is my second time taking it this year. But is was cool because we did nothing at all. I just talked to Kyle nd we both harassed Ashton the whole class. It was a good time had by all.(cept Ashton)lol We all talked and Kyle taped the whole class without anyone knowing, Mwahahahahahaha!!!! So it was good.   Hey now I'm fighting with one of my good friends again. I hate sucking so much. But whatcha gonna do right? I htink i need some time off from people but my mom would never go for it. So I'm damn near completely screwed. FUCK!!! W/e I can't stay out of trouble if I try.  And that's my whole day up to this point. I'll add more when i see fit.  -Wessle

      Well this is the first time I have posted anyhing on here. I think this is a much cooler way to do things than live journal. But to each their own. It's all good anyway. I hope whoever is reading this knows that it's not all always gonna be happy, or fun to read. But I am so much better at expressing myself by writingthan I am talking so natually this is the way to go. Hopefully some of you that are reading this will come back. I can already think of a few that I know will. Well for now I can only think of a few things to say really. I'll just tell you about my friends for now.  First off, Friday was fucking awesome!! The best night of my life by far! Thank you sooo much Jess. It really was so much fun. And never forget Mr.Wells. LOL!! We need to hang out more often outside of school. But we'll figure out a way. Love you tons!!  Second, my best friend in the whole wide world. Sammy. It's been so long we've known each other. Since the damn day u were born pretty much. We have had so many more good times than I can even remember. I just really want to say sorry for the dumb shit. The other day you know I didn't mean what i said. And if you think I did then you don't know me very well. BFFL!  Third, I love school. Seriously. I know it doesn't seem like it but without being able to see my friends I think I would honestly be dead right now. So thank you all. Sam, Jess, Nicole, Laura, Adam, Kyle, Ryan, Ashley.G, Ashley.M, Desiree, Kimmie, and anyone i forgot you are all so helpful. Thank you all so much.   Well I suppose for now that is all I really have to say. Check back some other time. Bye Bye.  -Wessle

      Well tomorrow im leaving for maine. It's gonna b a ton of fun. But there is still an enormous downside to going at all. Im missing my friends. When ur friends r ur lively hood and the only reason u get up everyday, its hard to just up and leave. But u kno i think its gonna b a good thing 4 me to leave. Being that i keep getting jumped by random big groups of ppl. Like 9 the last time. But w/e im still not hurt one bit and they r. LMAO!!! Nine fucking ppl couildnt take this shit down ppl. O fuck ya!!! Well idk what to write. I'm gonna miss all u guys, u kno who u r. Some will get letters others not. But all will be in my thoughts and dreams. Love u all(some more than most) -wessle  C u in 2 wks?

      And still i have nothing to write about really. Well, me n jess have been spending lots of time on the phone lately now that i am allowed to talk on the phone. I like it. We never really talk so its kinda refreshing to be able to talk to her and not have to go in 5mins or w/e. Its nice. And i get to talk to sam and nicole and all them ppl i care bout so im in a pretty good mood lately. I hope it lasts. Tho there really is no reason 4 it 2. I just hope it does. And things at home have been a lil bit better lately which is really good cuz 4 a while they were really unbearable. But its better 4 the time being so ill live life as best as i can while things r good.  Well, im going to maine in a few days. I htink im leaving on saturday night but nothing is 4 sure yet. Im gonna b gone 4 a wk or 2. Its all good tho. I get to spend some time with my family i never really c or spend time with. Its gonna feel good to get away i think. And either on the way up or the way back i think we might take a lil detour and go c my homeboy in NH, kyle. Itll b great cuz i wanna go c the theatre and stuff so i hope we get the chance to do it. I also hope later on this summer i get to go spend a wk or something up there cuz i want to work on the concert thing too. So here's hoping.   So ya thats bout all i really can think of to write right now. I live a boring life so this is what im stuck with. Ill tty ppl later. Ill try to update once more b4 i leave, if not ull hear from me eventually. C-ya!! -wessle

      11. Space-Dye Vest By Dream Theatre  Falling through pages of Martens on angels Feeling my heart pull west I saw the future dressed as a stranger love in a space-dye vest  Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding a pool in the shape of a heart Beauty projection in the reflection Always the worst way to start  [Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".] "But he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman. He doesn't know what a woman is. He wants you for a possession,  something to look at like a painting or an ivory box.  Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real,  or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you.  I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and  feelings, even when I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our  last chance..."  Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it Learning to swallow the rage Found a new girl I think we can make it as long as she stays on the page  This is not how I want it to end And I'll never be open again  [Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".] "...I was gonna move out...ummm...get, get a job, get my own place, ummm,  but... I go into the mall where I want to work and they tell me, I'm,  I was too young..."  [Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.] "Some people, gave advice before, about facing the facts, about facing reality. And this is, this without a doubt, is his biggest  challenge ever. He's going to have to face it.  You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and,  uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can  say they know how he feels."  [Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.] "That, so they say that, in ya know like, Houston or something, you'd say it's a hundred and eighty degrees,  but it's a dry heat. In Houston they say that? Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up. Dry until they hit the swimming pool."  [Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".] "...I get up with the sun... Listen. You have your own room to sleep in, I don't care what you do. I don't care when. That door gets locked,  that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock.  If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd  better find some  place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in  this house.  Supper is ready..."  There's no one to take my blame if they wanted to There's nothing to keep me sane and it's all the same to you There's nowhere to set my aim so I'm everywhere Never come near me again do you really think I need you  I'll never be open again, I could never be open again. I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.  And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend And I'll never be open again And I'll have no more dreams to defend And I'll never be open again

      Well im going away for a while and i dont kno when or if im coming back or not. So if i dont this would be my formal farewell to all those i have been fortuante enough to call my friends over the yrs.   Sam- God where the hell do i start. We have known each other longer than anyone would imagine. For a while everyone even thought we wee cousins. lol!! Ohhh.....i miss those days so so much. Many ideas have gone by the way-side tho. Like the m-o room, wet fur has stopped production for a while. Ok maybe thats all of them. I could not even hope to imagine someone as nice as you who would accept me the way i am. And ill forever be grateful for that. I hope someday u find the "one".  Nicole-Since first grade we have been friends. And since first grade we have been helping each other out with our problems. You ar ethe best person i have ever had to give me advice, and i love you for it. You are so nice sometimes it hurts u in the long run. But i think once ppl get to kno u they realize "hey whats not to love here". Keep on going with life and everything will be yours someday.  Jess-Well honestly i dont kno what to say bout u right now. I just met u this yr and it feels like i have known u ur whole life. Idk how many things there are we dontkno about each other. But id like to venture a guess and say not very many. Ur an amazing person and i guess u finally got what u wanted. God luck in the future.  Laura-Tho i kno ull never read this ill write it anyway in the hope that someone will give u a look at it someday. You out of all have been the greatest help to me this yr. I love you so much for everything youve done for me. Its so great to see you happy with James cuz i kno that u dont have all that much to be happy about in ur life. So its great that he is there for you. Always remember, that someday you will escape all that haunts you and you will be eternally happy for it.  Kyle and Adam-You two are like the same person really so ill bunch this together. You are the best co-workers i could possibly have had. You take the time to teach me as opposed to just doing the things that need to be done urself. I thank u 4 this as i have learned a lot in the last 2 yrs. If im not around i hope the company thrives and u end up as rich and well known as i kno u want to be. Good luck!!  Ashley-Ive known u 4 two damn months. I fell like its been two yrs. You are such a good person and such a good friend that its amazing the things that happen to u happen. Dont let urself get hurt again like the last time. U deserve better than any guy has to offer. So choose the best one u can find and then go 4 him as even he is not good enough 4 u. I love ya kid.  Kelly-Ur more of a big sister than a friend. And that has helped me a lot over the last few days. Im so glad that i kno u cuz if i didnt things would be a lot worse than they are now. You have given light to a lot of things in my life w/o realizing it. You give me the confidence to do the things im scared to do and that is certainly ur best quality. Ikn othings are bad right now but soon, very very soon they will get better. I love u like the sister i never had and i hope u never forget this if i dont come back.  I kno there are more of u than i have listed but this is all i have time for. Im pretty sure i will be back but if i didnt make it back id hate 4 u not to hear my last words to u. I love all of you and i hope no matter what u kno this. Good-bye one and all. -wes

      Well, instead of getting what i want, i got something else. Instead of getting class v/p. I got onto student council. It's all good tho. I still like to be on there to i just wanted something a lil better. O well its all good.   The bazarr is finally done. YES!! I loved it but im glad that its all done now. It was a few long hard days tho. Lots of work lots to think bout.   Today is an awkward day tho i must say. Sitting and waiting. Not knowing what is going to happen. But its all good. Im still in a good mood and im still loving it. So its all GOOD! I didnt sleep last night tho. It was a hard night thinkin the whole time. But it was needed so it was productive. tiring but productive.  Ya and now i have nothin to reallt say so im gonna go i guess. Peace! -wessle

      In case you're too damn stupid to tell by now....i'm at Sam's!! Yay for me!! For the first time in days I can forget my problems and have some actual fun!! So for those of you who don't want me to be happy or for the few ppl that constantly hurt me....albeit not always intentionally don't read any further. So ya for those of you who know mne really well, u know i ordered a new 4 disk set of cd's that ive been wanting 4 about 6 yrs. And they finally came in today!! YES!! The only real problem is that all the names of things are in Japenese. But it's all good. I know all the names anyway cuz im such a geek. lol. I also applied for a job online doing somthing im actually good at.....writing things about video games!! Go wesley its ur birthday!! O Ya!!   So then me n sam went off into the sunset.....ok it was the closet but its all the same when ur blindfolded. lol. But ya then we have a rip-roaring good time. And enough of that. Ok maybe not. So then the dog walked in and said to me,"Ya wes you tap that ass." To which of course i replied,"A'ight dawg!" And proceeded to tap that ass all night long.  Ok so then we just talked and laughed and my mood shot through the damn roof. So now im like so happy just to be here and be alive and im care-free and its so cool. I love ot be here where the bestest friend is and stuuff never goes wrong. Who couldn't love that? Good old times...knife in the floor...coffee cup and hammer...basement....light falling from ceiling...me falling down stairs...and u saving me from the basement after i fell down the stairs...lol good one that was...the M.O room that will prolly never be done...the smell of the best purfume ever made...and prolly the cheapest...purfume fights...old lady licking...wet fur(new issuse out sometime)...I mean how does it get better than this? It doesn't. So for that I say thank you.   This is the best time of our lives...and by the way for all thodse who want to kno...i touch myself...ask if u must...lol... bye bye  -wessle

      well, if u have talked to me at all in the last few wks u kno that im about as irritable as it gets lately. and for this im very sorry. but honestly i cant do a damn thing about it. i want to and i try to but its not working. so all of u who think i can just not b this way ive tried and i am trying and its not working. im so fucking pissed right now its sad. and there are only like two reasons and neither of them is all that good. so ya i guess all i really have to say is: im sorry to all of u who i have and will hurt during this but i cant stop i cant help it and i cant keep trying to make everyone happy. i think for once maybe i shold try to just b happy ofr myself and not just make everyone else happy instead. as selfish as i&nbsp; feel i dont think that there is any other way i can get myself out of this hole im in right now. ill still b here 4 those who need me but i cant just b here 4 u i need to b here 4 me now some too. but ya b4 i say anything to offend anyone in particular im gonna go....bye....
