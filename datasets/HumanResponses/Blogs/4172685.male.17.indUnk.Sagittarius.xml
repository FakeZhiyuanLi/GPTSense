      Hi Guys!! Vick a.k.a Joshua is here. A lot of u might be wonderin why i need a blog..hmmm..actually the reason i created this blog is to keep in touch with my friends alwiz, especially my secondary school friends whom i lost contact with..so i thought this is a great alternative to let u guys know what's happening in my life and share everything with you..i might not update the blog very frequently cuz i dont hv internet connection in the place i stay in penang.(sorry for that). but i'll try my best to post it from my college. i'll also upload some pictures if it's possible..hope to keep in touch with all of YA!! till then..ciao..
