      Lately this has been a challenge for me. Sometimes I feel like 'charly' from the movie of the same name. I need to talk to people who have the same interests that I have. Who can spark my creativity and make me feel like being social again.   That's why I hate group therapy. The group I'm in has people who complain about the same damn thing over and over again, yet refuse to make a move to change one damn thing. They ask your advice, you give it, listen to them and they come back next week and complain about the same things. Some aren't willing to do the work and I am no longer willing to listen. Ten plus years of that is too much, I need to work on me. But I also realize I need to be more social. Dilemma. So I took a risk am seeking out an old friend. She could always inspire me and I care for her deeply. I need her back in my life. Someone to talk too who has a brain. My best friend has a brain, but he's not always available. And I'm a bit needy right now. It's not fair to depend upon him entirely.   When I first became BiPolar I felt like I had walked into stupidville. Like all my smarts were just out of reach and I couldn't touch them anymore. So much confusion and lack of concentration. I don't get real manic like some bipolars, I get depressed more than anything. But I have the right meds and therapy and I've done some hard fucking work to get where I am now. And I'll continue to face the issues and do the work and improve, like I'm doing now. Whatever it takes.  I can read books again. But I go through phases, sometimes I can plow through three Patricia Cornwell novels. Other times I can't make it past page one. I have good intentions though and I keep trying.  Sometimes I feel my intellect is fading. Like all things, you have to keep  it in practice, and I haven't. Conversation keeps my mind sharp and I need a good one.

      I've been thinking about relationships and could I actually do the do. The whole couple thing. I was in one a year ago. I couldn't even hold his hand in the street. Uncomforitable as hell, awkward. Wrong guy needless to say. When I'm in that paired off state, I get nervous and terribly self conscious and unsure of myself. I make all kinds of mistakes, I'm a wreck. That's in public. But that's when I'm with 'the wrong guy'. The guy I don't feel natural around. The one that doesn't allow me to be myself.  Personally, I stay away from relationships. Too much compromising. Sure I'm willing to change things and give and take. But, if I'm not allowed to be who I am as a person, forget it. Supposedly, 'who I am' is part of what attracted you to me in the first place, not 'who I could become'.  I don't like to be accountalbe for my actions or to put myself in the position where I'm set up for verbal abuse. Been there, done that. Never again. My last relationship was very verbally abusive. It made me feel like I did when I was growing up, which is why I probably let it go on for as long as I did. Old habits. In many ways he reminded me of my father. I was weak, still mourning my uncle, in need of some attention.  So much of me knew better, but I was weak at the time.  I wised up, got stronger and got rid of him. Never again. I'm left with feelings of mistrust. A huge desire to be alone, which was there all the time. And a greatfulness that I'll never have to see him again, although for some reason I still talk to him. He's one of those manipulators you just can't get rid of in your life. But distance and will keep him out of mine.   There's no love lost on him. Just concern, I expect to hear he's dead one of these days. His life is that fucked. He taught me that 'Even flowers have their dangers and nice is different than good.' That's from Into The Woods,  one of my favorite plays.  So I keep my life simple by keeping to myself. Sometimes I miss male companionship. Then I remember the consequences and hope that one day I wont feel this way. But I doubt it, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Too many predators out there. Too much bullshit involved in keeping up a relationship, even a healthy one.

      I've been dealing with loss for quite some time. The loss of my sister, my uncle, my dog. But that's more like mourning. I  don't think I've fully recovered from my uncles death, the most recent one. I can't talk about my sister, so I guess that's still kinda ripe. My dog, Murphy Brown, only fond memories. Guess I've moved pass that and onto loving Chianna now, although it was hard.  My sister. She made me smile alot. We weren't the closest of kin, but we had fun and could talk if necessary. I miss her. I think what I miss most is having a sister. It's a wonderful feeling which I highly reccomend. Having someone there to share in the family experiences who is also a girl, way cool. It's a great bond. Like I said, we weren't the best of friends. Our relationship was getting better as we got older and over the sibling rivalry shit. Her attitude towards me had changed and she saw me for who I really was, not some brat. Whom I never was, thank you. Things were getting nicer, and then she got sicker and sicker and then she died.  So much death in my family. My uncle died next. I never realized how much he meant to me. How close I actually felt towards him. I think it was because when we use to go out driving, I use to pretend that he was my father. Rather than my real father, who caused me nothing but mental anguish. Sure, I understand the who, what, where, when and how's of my father's existance. I fully understand them.  But they don't excuse  his treatment of me. Especially when my mother was there to show him a better way. He went behind her back to verbally and mentally torture us. But that's for another day.  My mother says I'm alot like my uncle, the brains and sense of humor. I wish I had a chance to know him better. But as I got older, he became more of a recluse and ill. He died in the hospital and I cried harder for him than I did for my father. Go figure.   Things were good for me before his death, I was doing pretty well. Getting out more and exercising daily. I haven't been able to get back to that place of contentment yet. And now I'm dealing with the LOSS THAT SHALL NOT BE NAMED.  I had a very good conversation with my friend tonight. He's able to put his past behind him and not think in the terms of loss and just keep living. Sure, he's had losses. But he doesn't dwell or stuff. I need to get to that point. And the only way to get there is to deal with the main loss that I refuse to face and discuss.  But, I really can't do it because my therapist is on vacation. LOL. Seriously, I don't know where these thoughts are gonna take me. Either I'll want to eat the whole world, or plunge into a deep depression. I could put it all here, but that would turn into a whining fest. I'll figure something out.   http://roulette67.diaryland.com/082104.html

      Life is so 'liveable' when paranoia passes. Friends are friendlier, familia is more like family. And I am more like myself. Needless to say my best friend called. I dare not tell him where my mind went. Why, he'd laugh at me. Not the first time. Besides, these thoughts are fleeting and I shouldn't pay them any attention.  Should have done more constructive things than entertain them, duh. yada yada, I know all that shit. Anyways, I wrote my first fan letter EVER. Gonna mail it today. We'll see what happends. Probably nothing, but it's nice to get your thoughts out in the air, even if nobody is listening. At least you know they were said.  Had this dream that a guy had blown up the safe to all the toys in the world. Then he was like this Colombian drug lord and had this incredible security, but couldn't trust them because people kept falling asleep on duty while guarding the toys. And his ranks were infiltrated by spies. Real cool dream. The guy said, "What's the use in having all the worlds toys if you can't even play with them." He's too busy guarding them to enjoy their purpose.  My dreams have  been pretty strange lately. From the war one with arms and legs being blown off. To the one where I'm in this mental institution and there are all these bags of garbage and bottles and I'm trying to clean them out of my room. I'm thinking I've only been there for a short time, this garbage can't be mine because there is so much. And everything is white, even the trash bags.

      I'm not sure why today should be different from any other day. But I just feel that i should write. Things are boreing in my life. There is nothing that is there to make things different, but even if there were. I'm not sure if I could handle any type of excitement. Not sure what I can do to change things. Not sure what I'm able to handle. But I need to do something and soon.  I pass my time with writing and my dog. You get enough of my wrting here, so here's my dog.  http://home.comcast.net/~chicnoir-7/chieat.jpg

      I've always believed in a soulmate. Someone with whom you would automatically click. That deep friend/lover/bond. Where you could be yourself without shame or fear of judgement. Not two people as one, but two people who complement each other, two individuals together.  Looks like I'm gonna be alone. LOL. To me a relationship should be sharing and caring. Never dominating. In some ways, relationships scare the shit out of me. The closeness. But with the right person, it would be as natural as breathing. I know this, I can feel it.   I'm a romantic deep down. But life has made me extra wary of so many things. Doubting the possibility of ever acheiving happiness with another person. I like my solitude at times and at other times the lonliness kills. But you are never truly alone in this world.   I use to say things just to shock strangers, that's what they get for listening to my conversations. But now I don't care. So much of life is not caring lately. I think it's a defence.  Back to love. I'm not in love with anyone. No soulmate in my life. Just ideas.

      "Doctor, doctor help me please. I know you'll understand. There's a time device inside of me, I'm a self destructing man."   I've been phoning my friend, his phone doesn't work. I call the cell and he says 'I'll call you back'. Which means forget it, I'm not calling you back in LA language. Needless to say, I get paranoid. Like there's some plot to keep me from talking to my best friend. Or maybe he doesn't want to talk to me because he's got this 'life' and and I don't and there's no time for the looser. My mind goes places. But I don't take my friends there, just my mind. I know it's irrational. I don't entertain these thoughts for more than the instant they are there. But they occur. I reccognize them, say goodbye and go on my merry way.  I only get paranoid about not being able to reach my best friend. I guess it's a sign of insecurity where that is concerned. He's a male and the first and the only positive male relationship I have ever had in my life. So it's important to me. Probably more important than anyone will ever realize. Probably too important. My emotions have been all over the place with our friendship and I am so glad that I have nailed down it's importance, before I sabotaged the whole thing.   I love the guy, he's my teacher, my confidant, my brother, my friend. i just wish we could spend more time together. But such is life. Take what you can get, when you can get it.   Friends are hard to find for me. I have maybe a few associates but only two real friends. And that's by choice. Not everyone is your friend. One has to remember that, especially when it comes to secrets and good deeds and trust.

      I recently saw this story on American Justice. It bothered me because it concerned Mental Illness and the Death Penalty. The man Daniel Colwell gunned down two elderly people in front of a Walmart back in 2001; in hopes of getting the death penalty because he couldn't commit suicide himself.  He was a paranoid schitzophrenic and bipolar, not to mention depressed. Here are some links if you want the whole story.  http://www.walb.com/global/story.asp?s=237031&ClientType=Printable  http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/newab029/ 11_DanielColwell.html  http://www.geocities.com/gfadp/colwell011203.html  Now my thoughts. When I became mentally ill my first refuge was the internet. Luckily I found others here who were looking for the same thing. Someone to listen, someone who understood and someplace I wouldn't be judged. I also became aware of the difficult situation many people have just trying to get help. They see different doctors each time they go for treatment. So no one really knows if the medication is working. The nearest doctor is 'miles' away or there are no qualified psychiatrists or psychologists in their area. I've heard so many stories like this, and it's saddening. These people suffer all their lives.  If you saw the episode of American Justice, you would think he was rationale [sp] and for the most part, he was; choosing his victim and making sure they were dead. Pleading and pleading for death. Pleading for an end to his suffering.  It's a shame two people had to die because the mental health care system and stygma stink in this country. He was ashamed of his illness. Of what his family might think. What others might think. To hell with others, what about you. What about your mind and your survival. They'll get over it, but you won't without help.  Once Colwell was on his medication in jail he was lucid and didn't want to die and appealed. But I guest the beast got the best of him. The depression beast, the bipolar beast, whatever you wanna call it. He hung himself the beginning of last year.  Is it true that all things can be prevented in hindsight? Uneccessary.   Something has to be done about help for the mentally ill in rural areas in this country.

      You tell me. New Jersey is never the first with much of anything. Now we are the first state to have a govenor out himself and resign. History man. Personally, if the guy was doing a good job, what's the problem if he was gay or not. But he was married and sneaking around on his wife, so that was bad buisness politically. Something to hold over his head. So I guess he had to do what he did today. I wonder how long he knew he was gay? I think if your gay you should live your life that way and just avoid trying to do the hetero thing. It causes more problems than  just being who you are and trying to start a new life as a gay person. Sure there will be some family that wont accept you, but there are so many places and people in this country which accept gay people and their lifestyle. Mentally it's the best way to go.   I can't imagine living a lie for others. I could never do that.

      It amazes me the way my mind works. How I can crash and bail or soar with the eagles from day to day. Sure meds are great when they work, but they aren't the end all cure all. Hi, call me Roulette. I'm a Bipolar female from NJ. I write and sleep and try to get a grip on things in my mind. Currently I've gon through a few changes which I'll cover as they come to mind. Family friends and hopes and aspirations. Maybe even some politics, which I avoid because there is no logic involved in the whole science.  I live in a suburb which has seen better days as societies problems creep into my little town. Gangs, drugs and poverty. It scares me. So much sometimes I can't sleep. I see drive by's in every passing car and bullets flying thru my window. It's not that bad, but then again. Who knows.  I have a dog named Chianna and I live alone. I love movies and a few other things. I'm working on a screenplay and myself. Nuff said.
