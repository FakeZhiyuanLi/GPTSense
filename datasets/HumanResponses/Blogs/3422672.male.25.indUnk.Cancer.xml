      Last night I delivered to Ronnie.  When I got there he was very happy to see me like usual.  For a tip I got a copy of Hooters Sports News.  When I asked him if he was sure he wanted to give it to me he said that he had a bunch of them.

Heck yeah, hell yeah, fuck yeah.

      I tried to embed my Live Journal to the tacos but they wanted me to pay them to use my bandwidth rather than theirs.  This is where the stemshul will rest now...

      While grocery shopping today at the local D&W I ran across something that up until now had been but a legend, The Original Hawaiian Sweet Sandwich Rolls.

      I just found out today that I love a band that falls into the country genre.   urlLink Wilco  is a  urlLink Alternative Pop/Rock ,  urlLink Alternative Country-Rock ,  urlLink Adult Alternative Pop/Rock  band.  This labeling is very important because now I know that Im not allowed to like Wilco.  Either that or I must change the very fiber of my being.  Or I just have to realize that there are about 64 million too many music genres and theyre all a bunch of sh!t.  Im going with door number 3.

      I picked up the new  urlLink Wilco  album, A Ghost is Born, yesterday.  I highly recommend it.  Its the most intelligent new music Ive heard in a long time.

      On my way home from work this evening some kid in a Silverado pulled up next to me at a light.  I looked over at him and he was looking at me and then he started inching up and revving his engine like he wanted to drag me.  Having not been in a good drag since I traded the Miata in for my Ranger I gave him a knowingly nod.  I didnt think I had a chance but I thought it would be fun.  As I patiently waited for the light to turn green he kept revving his engine and inching up.  Finally the light changed and I spun my tires like any good dragster would do.  They caught and I was off like a rocket.  Almost immediately I could see his headlights in my rear view mirror.  Not until I reached 70 did he start to catch up with me.  Being at 70, which is also double the speed limit, I decided that the race was over and took my foot off the accelerator at which time he quickly speed past me.  It was at this point that I realized that he was really trying to catch me and couldnt.  It just goes to show that Its not how big your engine is, its how you drive the car.

      Heres some advice to all you people who dont understand proper tipping etiquette.  If youre not going to tip then dont tip and leave it at that.  Dont acknowledge the fact that youre not tipping by saying that you dont have any more money and will tip the person "next time".  There will be no next time.  I know it and you know it.  If you tell me that a second time I will call you out on it.  Then how will you feel?

      Ill never know why a talented actor like Samuel L Jackson does these movies.  S.W.A.T. was a movie where not enought hostages got shot.  Infact I cant even talk about it right now because Im so pissed off about it.

      Theres this  urlLink Creed Fansite  that me and katohater found a couple years ago.  I think Im pretty cool because I go there and make fun of them on the message board because of their taste in music.  Well its not any fun anymore because they dont talk on the board.  This is just another reason that even Jesus hates Creed.

       A couple weeks ago me and the  urlLink Jew  were playing around with our cell phones because it was slow as hell at work and we were board.  I showed him how I could forward calls from my phone to any line that I knew the number too.  He checked his phone and forwarded calls to my phone.  Having had our fun we turned the forwarding off and went on with our day. 

 About twenty minutes ago I received a phone call.  Yes I received a phone call at 1:55 am.  I didnt get to it in time because I was in bed trying to sleep.  When I looked at the phone there was a number on it that I didnt recognize.  It was vaguely familiar but I didnt know who it was.  When I called the number back it went to a girls voice mail.  The voice on the message sounded like the Jews girlfriend.  I wasnt sure though.  I know  urlLink katohater  has her phone number so I log onto the online to see if hes there.  He wasnt but the Jew was.  This is the discussion that followed:

 So whats the moral of the story?  Dont date Jews.

      Firefox?  I downloaded that  urlLink Firefox  program that  urlLink everyones  been talking so much about.  Its pretty fancy.  It allows you to cutomize alot of stuff.  Definitally better than the Mozilla I was running.  Its not a whole lot better than IE, but some, eh hem.

       urlLink Kato  mentioned that we have entered the secret society that is Sams Club. Last night my boss asked me how I liked it and if Id found any good deals. I told him that we saved alot of money on Clariton. He then says "Clariton, is that what you use? I can get you some Clariton." This is protocal with him. If youre talking about something he can do one of three things.

He either
     can get you some.     knows the person who owns it.     knows something better that you should use.    Now I have some, dont care who owns Clariton and dont think theres anything better out there for allergy relief. So how do I tell him to suck it. All I want him to 'get for me' is this.
     New uniforms when my old ones are tattered. (like they are now)
      A raise, say every year, that reflects my ability and contributions to the company.
      A work environment that I can look forward to being in no matter whos running the shift.    These are the things a boss should give his employees. I can get Clariton, cup cakes and Faygo if I want them. I cant get the other things by myself.

      In  urlLink this post  I was accused of saying that katohater has "no extra space".  He says I said this in  urlLink this post . If you read the post youll see that I actually said "theres not much extra room in his room. Its packed." Now I was at the house since the move and kato has allocated alot of his floor space back. Im not sure where the sink ended up and Im pretty sure he wound up having to burning a lot of his stuff, but in the end it looks very nice.

      For the most part the great move of 2004 has been completed. Theres just a little bit here and there that needs to be finished up. Its going to be interesting. Katohater has never lived away from his parents before and brought everything but the kitchen sink. Strike that, he may infact have brought a kitchen sink. Im not sure. Needles to say theres not much extra room in his room. Its packed. 

Heres the living arrangement. Katohater, Uglytaco and Shedubeard are all living with Shedubeards wife and child. Kato and Ugly are living in the basement which is also where the den/musicroom/commons/dvd vault is. Shedus office is also in the basement. This will give him the feeling of actually going to work since hell beable to be on an entirely different floor than his family while hes 'at work'. This situation will prove to be interesting because Kato and Ugly will also have their food/kitchen in the laundryroom which is Shedus office. 

About the den/musicroom/commons/dvd vault. This is the room where all the band equipment is going to be. Also lining the walls is all (mostly) of Katos DVDs. There is a theory that there will be several TVs set up for multi video game playing pleasure. 

No ones really sure if Kato and Ugly are allowed upstairs. Shedu is allowed up stairs. We know this because he is incapable of providing himself with food and must be to dinner at 5:30 sharp. With the longer comute home from work the 5:30 deadline could prove to be a little difficult but it might mean leaving the office a little early. Gotta eat the food when its hot. He is trying to grow himself a Stemshul Pot-Belly®. 

The Jew and I have been taking bets on who drops first and at whos hand.  I think Shedu will take Kato out in a hairy rage. 

On an unrelated note. I dont think the spell checker on this blogger is working. Its been three posts now that Ive put up that Ive run the spell checker on and no errors have shown up.
