      I've lived the majority of my life in "The Valley."  Yes, the very same one made famous in song.  And yes, sadly, we really did talk that way.  Moreso after the song came out, but that was just a matter of being proud of ourselves, our surroundings, our AWESOMENESS.  Or maybe we were just teenage posers.  Who isn't at that age?  So, while not a first generation "valley-ite," I'm proud to say I was one of the original Valley Girls.  Don't let anyone from the Valley fool you; we're all still the same deep down inside.  Fun loving, pool lounging, shopaholics (even if they did kill our beloved Galleria and replace it with something    totally   unrecognizable.  Burke Williams was a good addition, though.)  Alas, we Valley Girls have aged.  I, myself, am a mother of two.  A working professional with never enough time to do everything I need to do, fighting what can only be described [much to my dismay and chagrin] as "middle-aged spread."  But I'm not old.  I may be nearly 35, but I'm a Valley Girl, for sure, and we can't get old.  We're immortalized, thankyouverymuch Mr. Zappa.   So, if you are not among the fortunate and an O.G. Val yourself, forgive me if I periodically lapse into my Valspeak.  I'm not trying to be condescending, it's just in the genes!  The last 4 years have been unreal for me.  I've had my share of triumphs and tragedies, and I'm still stabilizing in the aftermath of both.  The highs were so, so, HIGH, the lows defied the depths of hell at times.  I've got all this crap stored in me, that I simply must purge and you are my lucky audience.  I've decided to get it all off my chest, in the most brutally honest fashion.  I'm tired of trying to keep much of this stuff to myself, lest I be embarrassed in front of other people.  What the fuck is that all about, anyway?  I don't care about most of them, and life is what it is.  Mistakes, blunders, things that work out.  Most of them are better used as comedy than fodder for the grist mill, since we all suffer indignities repeatedly throughout this life.  Right?  Yah, right!  So, after my kids, I find myself about 40 lbs. above my normal weight.  I've been reading the South Beach Diet, and it sounds like a good philosophy.  I'm not 16 anymore, and I CAN'T eat whatever I want.  Most people can't, so it's not like I'm less of a human being for it.  (Even though many would and have tried to make me feel that way.)  I'm not the 'fat fucking cunt' my mother in law says I am.  I got fat for two good reasons.  My son, and my daughter, who were born less than 2 years apart (with my youngest being only 5.5 months old as I type this.)  They're awesome, so I didn't mind what it did to my body.  The fucking cunt part, well that came naturally, my birthright really.  The fat part and the fucking cunt part have nothing to do with one another--let's just get that straight.  I won't be fat forever; in fact not much longer.  As for being a fucking cunt, well that's probably here to stay.    Back to the South Beach.  Today is day 6.  As of yesterday, I've lost 6 lbs.  So, I guess I'm 34 lbs over my normal weight now.  Progress, gotta love it.  I realize that my love affair with sugar, particularly chocolate anything, has at long last come to an end.  I'll have to indulge my unhealthy tendencies in some other fashion.  Promiscuity, maybe.  No wait, I already did that one.  And I am married after all.  I'm still smoking--and in Los Angeles that's the 8th deadly sin.  But I'm not catholic, so I don't give a rat's ass.  I'll give that up eventually, but not because some asshole guilted me into it.  If I did it while dieting however, then I'd have to take up random homocide because well, I'd be like a fat fucking cunt on speed.  Hmmmm, speed.  Now there's an unhealthy practice that would actually aid the weight loss...Oh that's right I already did that one too.  I'll keep thinking on it.
