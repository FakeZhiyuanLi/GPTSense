       Guess this is what happens when you are sleeping off and on all day long.   I do sort of like being awake when no one else is though,cause I can listen to my music and groove without feeling stupid lol.   Have you ever noticed ,even if you don't like to drink it,that brewing coffee smells incredible ?    There's coffee brewing in the kitchen and it smells fabulous.   Make me hungry for scrambled eggs and sausage :)   May have to go make myself some breakfast and have a cup of coffee,seems like a good way to start the day.   I'm listening to Super Duper Love by Joss Stone   She is amazing,she has this incredible jazzy-soul filled voice and she is 16yrs old. How impressive is that ? I absolutly love her sound.   Anyway,enough raving about her . . doesn't hurt that she's gorgeous either lol. Sorry,couldn't resist. I actaully think I may be able to go back to sleep shortly,although how I can feel tired I will never know.   I wonder sometimes how many people actually read this, and if they do how many of them think I am completly stark staring   bonkers  ?  Hmmm . . .But if I toned down the insanity it just wouldn't be me and thats finally what it's all about,being who I am. Crazy or not,it's all me.   I actually feel bad for my boyfriend sometimes cause he puts up with this on a pretty much daily basis. Poor man.   I am probably going to start working on the book I have been trying to write,I can always seem to see it in my head but it never wants to transfer to paper. It makes me crazy sometimes,I haven't written much in the way of poetry lately. my poems always seem born of strong negative emotions and since I have been relativly     smiley   this week,nada!   Oooooh,time for me to go to bed before I get philosophical or something and ruin my image of instability lol   Love   you all    Duckie   to the soul,   Daisy

       No, the title has nothing to do with the post. I couldn't think of anything else to put up there. So anyway,today was interesting I spent most of it either sleeping or in bed  (wink,wink)   I must have been more worn out than I thought . .I slept well last night although my boyfriends bed did beat me up quite a bit.   He must have the most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in.   Although,as long as I get to be beside him,I'd sleep in the fires of hell if I had to :) I made dinner tonight for him and his family,cajun chicken alfredo over tortellini. It was so incredibly good.   I wanted to let everyone know I read something on the internet that makes me believe computers are truly evil.   A very reputable university did a survey of area churches and found that on the whole,there are more reports of demonically possesed computers than people :)   How bizarre is that ?   Watched my fave episode of Family Guy tonight,called To Live and Die in Dixie. You should check it out,it's hilarious.I just got out of the shower a little bit ago.Have you ever noticed that nothing feels as good, when you're groggy and sore, as a nice   hot   shower.   I swear I should have been born a fish(or a duckie) as much as I like the water.I have another song recomendation for ya'll. Check out   The Counting Crows : Accidently in Love.   It is a really great album.   Well, now that I've mumbled and grumbled and blown the house down,it's time for bed. See you soon,Same bat time, Same bat channel .      Duckie   to the soul,   Daisy

       Today was my aunt's 50th birthday :) I spent most of the day dealing with my  outrageous  family . At least I no longer have to wonder where I got all this pent up energy and fiesty-ness lol. Right now I am just kind of kickin back, before I head for a shower and a nap,just fillin you all in and groovin to some music. I get to spend the next two days with my boyfriend :)  I can't wait ! We haven't seen each other at all this week and I think we're both pretty excited to see each other. I have to keep this short and sweet cause I really do have to get a shower but I'll be back later,until then . . .    Duckie   to the soul,   Daisy

        I can hear you saying for undoubtedly the 100th time,why did she call her blog a  rubber duck  ? Simple, I have an unholy obsession with  Rubber Ducks  :) Everyone needs a  rubber duck ,regular duck maintenece is simple. Place on corner of tub and then shower or bath let em float. Voila . .happy  duck  :0 No I am not  crazy  although I have my moments. Let me introduce myself,I'm  Heather ,my friends call me  Daisy . In case you wondered,daisies are my favorite flower. Feel free to make a nuisance of yourself by leaving comments and such,it's what I live for. I will tell you I plan to have some  deep  philosophical stuff here but mostly it will just be me chewing your ears of about my average day and random events. I guess you would probably like some background information huh ? Damn. I knew that was coming. First things first,I'm back ! I know you have no idea what that means but understand it is exclaimed in Jubilation and thats all you need to know. I lost love,somewhere inside myself,I couldn't find it. So the other day I stood on my front porch in the pouring down ice cold rain with the wind whipping the hell out of me. I looked up and in the streaming rain I looked at myself. Truly myself,bare and raw,in a storm I found what I have searched for and haven't found in three years of blindness. It is hard to heal wounds in your soul,especially if you don't know they are there. The love of an  Angel  helps(he knows who he is) as does his support and friendship,I'm only sorry it took someone elses pain to heal me. My apologies. I am back !  Joyous  and  alive ,I am back ! I don't know if you have ever been soul lost,I don't recomend you try it. Ok,enough of that. Here's the fun stuff, I am 23, have god only knows what color hair and blue-green-gray eyes. My hair has not been it's real color since I was 16 yrs old :) I am heading off to school hopefully in the next year,I want to be an esthetician(if you don't know what that is,look it up !) I love sparkly things and have a short attention span,I collect   flamingos  ,yes I said   flamingos ,  shut up you ! I have to have about 9 or 10 pillows on my bed or I can't sleep,I snuggle a ratty old carebear when I am sick,sad or afraid. I steal the covers and snore,but not nearly as loud as that angel I was telling you about. I have a fondness for cottage cheese and  olives  mixed together,don't knock it till you've eaten it. I love pepperoni and sausage pizza,hawaiian pizza is good too.Music . . .hmmm. I like just about anything. If you like a good jazz sound,get Joss Stone-the soul sessions. Awesome,awesome,awesome ! I love    Celtic (pronounced K-eltic) things,Ireland,faeries etc. I love hippie clothes and bell bottom jeans,cool boots and funky jewelry. When I drink,I drink Tequilla,straight. No,I'm not a bad ass I just like the  burn  . I grew up with a younger brother and two rowdy cousins,I'm a bit of a tomboy :) I like to play in the rain and mud,I dont' fish but I do watch lol. I hate spiders,cauliflower,brussel sprouts and the color  pink . I am definetly not a morning person. 10 am is ungodly to me :) I like to write,poetry,stories etc. I may post some here from time to time to torture you. I like to think I have a relativly good sense of humor,it's a bit wacky though . . .oops. I think that should be about it for now lol. I will definetly write more later.  Duckie to the soul, Daisy
