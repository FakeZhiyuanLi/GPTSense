           Haircuts are dangerous things for the adolescent male.  Each boy has his own distinct style, and though none would admit to caring altogether too much about it, the strands of dead proteins that grow atop each person’s head form alternately a shield or a massive chink in the armor of his self-esteem.  We don’t admit to checking our hair in the mirror.  At least, I don’t.  Brett does, but Brett was also the first among us to get pubic hair, so he’s always been a bit out there.  So we try not to make sure our precious locks are in place.  In the seventh grade there are some boys who have woken up to the faint odors of feminine grace and beauty and other boys who have not.  These are easily differentiated because the latter group is still letting their mothers crew-cut their hair once a week while the former group has decided it is better to have a more fashionable hairdo.  There is nothing wrong with the crewcut.  It is a useful haircut and one that is easily managed.  Nevertheless, the crewcut is absolutely without flair.  Unless you have an unfortunate cowlick that sends one section of your crewcut careening into space, your crewcut ends up looking like a flat mat of hair across your head.  This is fine, like I said, if you don’t care about women.  I care about women.  Somehow, I always have.  So I’ve never gotten a crew cut.  There is another reason: supposedly my father had straight blonde hair until he got a crew cut when he was thirteen and it grew back dark and wiry, the way it is today, and I didn’t want my hair to decompose like that.    	Thus the teenage male's hair is in every way a reflection of his prospects for reproductive success.  The hair, vanity of vanities, is the first step to biological evolution.  When a teenage male hopes to take the first steps toward reproduction (and this urge, stronger even than the urge to eat, sleep or talk, is the sole governing urge in the male body from age twelve until he discovers money), he knows he must first begin to care about his outward appearance.  Granted, this is a complete waste of time and psychic energy because the last thing on a thirteen year-old girl’s mind is a thirteen year-old boy.  She cares only about fourteen and fifteen year-old boys, but that is an altogether separate phenomenon about which the thirteen year-old boy is absolutely oblivious and so it will receive its just treatment later.  The thirteen year-old boy begins bringing deodorant to school.  This deodorant he stashed in his gym locker in order to apply it in the five minutes between gym class and lunch.  Several of my comrades learned to slacken their participation in gym class soccer games in order to reduce their sweat outputs, but I was too competitive to let some weakling garner the glories of gym class sports, so I went all-out during gym class and built up the wretched lather of perspiration that only I knew how to build.  Thus, the deodorant became a necessity.  I sprayed what remained of my father’s half-used can of Right Guard onto the small patch of pubic hair beneath my armpit until the can’s aerosol spray had sufficiently cooled my hot skin.  When my skin was cool to the touch, I knew that I had enough deodorant to mask my own odor.    	And so it was that I went off to lunch smelling like a deodorant factory.  Happily for me, much of the rest of the seventh grade was equally obsessed with hygiene, and so my own alcohol-based obsession was lost in the milieu.
