      Okay. I have so much to talk about, but right now I'm at work, so I have no time to tell you just yet. But, I have thoughts on really good reality t.v., and the ever so famous, Omar.   My computer at home is on the outs right now, because it got infected with some virus. So, it's all whacked out, can't do much on it, which is why I have been unable to enthrall you guys with anything good to snack on. Nevertheless...I'll be back soon!!!

      Monday morning, who do I hear from?? The one, the only...Omar. Yep, he had the nerve to text me on my cell, and try to apologize for hurting me, and that no matter what the love he has for me will always, and still is there for me. Whatever!! I was somewhat nasty, but I 'm tired of hearing thesame crap-o-la, and plus, I know now what I really want out of a man, and a relationship. I tell ya'll, it ain't nothing that I 've had before, "trust me when I tell you"!

      Well, I have not done much today. It is 6:41pm, and I just took a shower and brushed my teeth. Yup! Don't even dare and say that's nasty, because guess what? I  work hard all week, pay my own bills, answer to no one except God and myself, and the Lord sure has not complained about it, so you can't say a darned thing. Deal with that.  Anyways,my girl Ari has been calling me all day since this morning, asking why I have not called her today, why I won't come hang out with her while she has the Pastor's kid, since they're in Chicago right now(along with everyone else we know.  urlLink Pastor Paula  (church co-pastor @  urlLink WWIC ), is having a major big time Christian crusade up there,and we just happen to be stuck here, because our sorry behind job (Ari & I,work together)doesn't give us the days. They deny everything you request. She thinks, I'm depressed and just moping and having a pity party, wanting to be stuck in my circumstances. Okaaaay...No. I just want to relax and enjoy my home, and the fact that I have nothing to do, no one pulling on me or asking me to help them with anything. That feels good. On top of me doing some things in the house that need to be done, and reading some, and writing some. Oh, and also, I don't really have money right now, so I don't have excess gas to be wasting, rippin' and running the streets... for what?   I'm actually, somewhat of a really homey person. I'm not old, I'm just getting to a place in my life where I'm REALLY starting to see what the important things are in my life. You have to sit down and breathe, and relax because there will come a time when our life goes into the next level, and time will no longer be our commodity...it will become a luxury. Enjoy life...enjoy and cherish your real friends. You don't have to spend every waking moment with them, but plan dates and get togethers from time to time (even if you got a man ).Enjoy your house, or apartment, or wherever you call home. Because someday soon, that place of serenity will become the next local circus of crying kids, wanting your every attention, and getting it anyway they can from screaming , yelling, fighting each other, getting into stuff you told them a trillion times to stay out of, messing up the places in the house that you just straightened up 10 minutes ago, telling you they hate kids church and are not going....whoooo!! The list goes on...I'm no mother yet, but I have nannied enough to see what that life entails. I will be happy to embrace all of that...when I'm ready for that. And right now, I'm not. I'm ready to get to the bottom of  ME , and who  ME  is, and what  ME  wants, and what  ME  can give and offer.  I took the first step yesterday, by going by the  urlLink college  to re-apply and see what Financial Aid will reward me for the next year. I left college in 1998 after one year, and am just now returning. Granted, I feel as if I am not doing anything with my life,and am working a dead end job that has no apparent hopes of evolving into any career; I feel I am making a good step towards one of my goals. Better, late, than never, right? I won't have to regret not getting that degree, I'll just be regretting that I didn't get it done sooner. Oh, and then they tell me that I need to take the stupid entrance exam again!! I was like, "why"? The advisor said,"They're only good for two years, baby. How would we know where to place you in math or anything?" And I'm like,"Right where I was before". She looked at me and was like, "baby, you graduated high school 7 years ago, you might need prep courses to start off". Okaaaaaaaaay!!! What, you think I'm boom boom, or something? Mind you, I was in all honors courses, (except in math), and was in many honor societies in high school. I ain't no boom boom, first year, straight out of high school freshman. But of course, I was saying all that *ish*, in my head. She told me that there were prep test booklets of the entrance exam in the bookstore, and advised I invest in them to prepare for the test first, so I would not have to take prep math, english or reading. Believe you me, I was at that bookstore in a quick Tampa hotstep, forking over $12.84 to get them booklets.   It's funny, because my roommate and I have been lounging around all day watching reality and make-over shows, and complaining about how we feel we are not accompolishing anything. She is 22, I'm 25. She is a full-time student @  urlLink USF , and works at the  urlLink  "Blue Martini"   at  urlLink  International Mall  . I feel she is at least doing a bit more than me...but, I completely feel her. Well, I'm not flowing as well right now, so I'm going to veg out in front of the T.V.

      You know it really sucks that I had to re-create another journal, because I could not remember my old username and password. But, I guess better to start fresh and anew, since so much has happened in the past couple of months. I have definitely entered a new chapter in my life, and am happy to say goodbye to the ones previous.  This has been an emotional week so far. I have finally ended the relationship with a man (that really should have never been in my life). I know it was not on any accord of his, but it just hurts to know that you cannot be with someone that you love so much, but at the same time know is completely not for you. I'm sure you are only catching part of this, but it is hard to just put it out there to the world that you were in a relationship with a man that you met at work, was your male confidant that listened to your troubles and heartache that you spilled out to him on lunches and breaks about another man, them seemingly the relationship evolved mysteriously as well as suddenly into a forbidden attraction of two people, one(Omar, is his name by the way, he is a 25 year old Kingston,Jamaica born, Bronx raised man )who had a live-in girlfriend, two children(boys) by her, who were the ages of 3 and 5; oh, and did I tell you that she also worked with us? Yeah, she did. But, it just so happened to be in a different department, so it was not obvious to her about our attraction...until later in the months.   This affair lasted 9 months...technically 8, because the last month(which happens to be this one)we only saw each other once, and the rest of our communication was through e-mail, cell phone, and text messages. Isn't technology really convienent when you're creeping? That was not meant to be taken literally, so please don't.If you're wondering if I felt any remorse...YES!! I felt like a complete homewrecker, and just about everything else you could think of. But you see, it didn't happen like you're probabaly conjuring up. It was a completely innocent friendship that evolved out of constant communication in the workplace via e-mail, and breaks.And just a little side-bar, he would talk to me about some of the relationship, and he was really not happy in it at all. I know in no way, shape nor form does it make our little rendezvou's right, but we worked the same shift, saw each other daily and had a mutual connection where I treated him completely how he was longing to be treated and feel, and he made me feel like a princess and did pretty much whatever he could to make me happy. How could any woman resist that. I battled continuously with the fact that he was not mine and belonged to someone else, as well as had children( along with a 9 year old son in Jamaica, by another woman).Yeah...homeboy didn't just have baggage...he hade major cargo and drama.   Needless to say, we ended up getting caught;I'll leave it at that.All three of us got fired from our job's (even though our relationship had nothing to do with our job nor was anything done on their property), when really she should have been the only one fired , since SHE THREATNED MY LIFE!!!  He ended up getting kicked out of their apartment, staye dwith me for 3 and a half weeks...mind you, I have always been adamant about never ever living with a man until I get married. Yup. I put my size 8 foot right in my mouth, because two days later, Omar and I were shacking it up, alongside my roommate in my 2bedroom, 2 bath apartment.  Well, I got a job the very next week, he ended up on unemployment...(and still is)and has not found a job yet. he is no longer with me....yup, you guessed it. They are back together, living together, back to THEIR old lives. Situation still the same obviously, because homeboy was still contacting me in every way and confessing how he loves me so much, and does not know how much longer he can continue on with the way things are. He feels he is doing right because of the children, but knows he truly wants to be with me.Blah, blah blah, blah, blah.   Whatever...that was last week, and Thursday(03-13) morning @ 3am, my cell is ringing. 3am, in the freakin' morning!! I'm not answering it I was thinking, because the number was not programmed in my phone; therefore, I didn't know who it was...until I received another call a minute later from the same number, and I realized it was Omar. But something told me not to answer. I'm glad I didn't. It was him leaving me a message saying that we can no longer conversate, " U leave me alone, I leave you alone", he says. "I need to try and work things out with my girl", and he hung up. I heard her yelling in the background, but just the way it was said and how he hung up, I knew it was forced and she put down some ultimatum. I heard in his voice how he did not want to do it. But whatever...I'm moving on.He was the one that kept on with I need you in my life...I changed my number, but was the fool for giving it to him again after he called my friend asking for me.   I can't continue to focus on something that will never be, or that's definitely not for me. He doesn't belong to me, or in my life as much as I want him to.  I know that the way he treated me was what intrigued me, but I need so much more. I need someone who I can relate to equally in everyway, and someone who wants to do more and change, and JUST DO IT!!! Not continue to talk about it, and do nothing about it. I need someone that will push me, and me him.I need someone not attached and someone with no CARGO!! Baggage is alright, cause we all have issues...but all that other drama, is unecessary in my life.   He isn't the ONE. I love him. But, I can get over him. IT'S FINISHED. Thank God.
