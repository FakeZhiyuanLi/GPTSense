      I went home for Christmas.  My parents have begun to redecorate the house I grew up in, which is just wierd.  For 15 years or so I lived there, and all the walls were white, no curtains, nothing.  And now?  Curtains, and the kitchen is green.  It's wierd.  And they are turning my bedroom into my mom's knitting/sewing room.  Sigh.  I got to see my dog, and my 18 year old cat, Woodrow.  He's got cataracts, the poor dear, and arthritis.  Despite all that, he still picks on the other cat.  Which is good, since she's evil.  I am now a first-time car owner, and I'm about to order checks for my joint account.  Damn, I'm old.

      Since I moved in with J, and he already had power/water/etc, all those bills are in his name.  We tracked expenses for 3 months, with me buying all the groceries, toiletries, etc.  It averaged out to about $200 difference between what I was paying for misc. stuff and what he was paying for various household expenses.  So now we spend $50 a week on groceries, and I give him $50 a week for expenses, and it works out even.  We've had the "money talk" a couple of times.  Mainly when he went through periods of little to no work last winter (he's a construction worker).  I was basically supporting the two of us, and it was very stressful.  We sat down, figured out how much we HAD to spend to keep ourselves fed and housed, and that was it.  It was hard, and there was fighting (should we spend extra money going to the movies, buying new PS2 games, or paying extra on the bills?), but we got by.  We figured out what money we needed to spend, what we needed to save, and what we just wanted to buy.  It was during that period that I set up a seperate account just for savings, and started having $10 a week deposited there.

      Ha!  I knew I had something in mind to post today!  Dodge Durango commercials- and Dodge commercials in general- piss me off.  The last commercial on the TV in the other room was for the Durango.  It features a couple and their baby.  In a Durango.  Just them.  In a Durango.  That's the first problem.  There is nothing in this huge vehicle but mom, dad, and baby.  Second problem:  Mom's biggest concern is for the DVD player in the backseat, and for the comfort (alleged) of this vehicle.  Dad is incredibly dismissive of this, and insists that all Junior needs to know is how to say "Hemi."  Or gas-guzzling Suburban Assault Vechile.  This commercial promotes irresponsible vehicle choice, as well as stereotyped gender roles.  But it's not as bad as the OTHER Durango commercial.  You know, the one at the picnic?  I think I've blocked it out.  Anyway, the "wife" is portrayed as manipulative, and the "husband" as a bully.    And then there's the Lingerie Bowl.

      So the hoodlums on my street got evicted.  At least, I assume they got evicted.  There's a Dumpster in front not filled with construction debris, but with furniture.  While I feel bad that there's another family without a home, I won't miss them.  These kids hung out on the corner (where my house is) drinking (at age 13), smoking, swearing...yeah, just fine upstanding young men.    I signed up for Paypal recently, and now am inundated with spam.  Sigh.  Also, I need to read less crap and      STOP STRESSING ABOUT MY DAMN WEDDING THAT IS OVER A YEAR A WAY I DON'T HAVE TO ARRANGE ANYTHING YET SO ZOE QUIT IT!!!!!!    .  Sincerely, Zoe.

      My house, in the middle of my street... My house is small- 2 bedrooms, one bathroom, and a formerly attached garage that's now the computer/winemaking room.  It's got issues.  There's the broken window (J locked himself out once), the garage door with a hole in it, the cracked foundation, the yard that's mostly dandelions...the list goes on.  Then there's the "Bob" problems.  The previous owner of this house was Bob, J's brother.  Bob is a walking, talking, cowboy stereotype.  He and his friends threw knives at the wall, danced in their boots on the nice wood floors, stuck beer labels on the walls, gouged holes out of the kitchen floor, put various parts of various people through the walls...the list goes on.  So yeah, it's a damn good thing J's a carpenter because he can fix most of this.  But despite all this, I love my house.  It's where my family is.  J, the cats (one of whom is on my lap), the gecko, the fish, the plants...it's happy.

      Did you know they make pomegranate juice?  They do!  And, the best part is, it's good with vodka!  I work in the HR office of a construction company.  Right now, it's open enrollment for the health insurance.  This means, it's the one time of year in which people can make whatever changes they want to their enrollment choices for no reason at all.  This has been going on for 13 days.  Tomorrow's the last day.  We've sent out a letter explaining all this, and that we  absolutely, positively must have all forms in the office by tomorrow at 5 .  No exceptions, no matter if you're the CFO, a laborer, or the Pope.  It don't matter- in the eyes of our little HR kingdom, all are equal.  So, you would think, that if a person lived in East Podunk and had no fax machine or computer or scanner nor access to these things, they would perhaps call sometime before the 2nd to last day of open enrollment.  But noooooo.  So I faxed these forms to a florist today, since that is apparently the only place in East Podunk with a fax.  Not a particularly funny story, is it?  My cat is playing with a ball and she bounced it into J's big ol' water ski boots and now she's confused.  I'm torn.  Should I be a nice person and get it out, or should I be mean and not and enjoy her confusion.  Right now I'm leaning towards the latter.  This is the dumb cat.  Although, she does know what time J gets up in the morning, a fact that has saved him from being late (and, by extension, me, since he wakes me up) several times.  Although she doesn't understand the concept of Saturday.  Or Sunday.  Or long weekend.  If anyone out there has any idea how to teach these things to a cat with white fluff for brains, email me at zoe_chrys@yahoo.com  I just found out that the spell checker doesn't know my name is a valid word.  That can't be good for my self esteem.

      Hi.  I know you all are just dying to hear about my life.  So, under the influence of really good pizza (homeade!) and really good beer (Fat Tire), I decided to share.   Today I went to Lowes.  I bought my finace, J, a table saw and miter saw.  Yes, I know I'm awesome.  So today I bought him wood to mess with, since saws aren't much good without wood.    I'm getting a new table and bookshelf out of the deal, so it's all good.   Wanna see some pictures?  I know you do! http://community.webshots.com/user/zoetheshort

      http://www.dodgeglobe.com/stories/011704/sta_0117040065.shtml  I can't believe this.  Well, actually I can.  Kansans tend to vote GOP.  Which is not a party known for caring if people go hungry.  But here, in Kansas?  Have you ever eaten food?  If you have, there's a pretty good chance you've eaten Kansas food.  Agriculture is one of the main industries here, there are surpluses out the wazoo, and yet we can't feed our own people?

      wOOt!  Blogging on a Monday!  Today's stupid commerical:  McDonald's.  Mom goes to the playground to pick up the kids and they won't come to the car.  Song lyric asks "What would MacGyver do?"  Mom picks up an empty McD's bag from the car, waves it, kids come running.  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think MacGyver would have   blown some shit up   using gum, a straw wrapper, and a fossilized French fries.  You know, just to get their attention.

      Went to the pet store yesterday, to buy some Herptivite (reptile vitamin powder).  While there, J saw a bearded dragon.  http://www.sundialreptile.com/carm02fro.htm Now he wants one.  These animals need a 50 gallon tank when adult, so we've decided to start acquiring all the "stuff" necessary now, and then get a dragon.  J wants to build a cabinet/holder for the tank.  He wanted to just keep it directly in the wood tank, which is fine, except a pain in the ass to clean.  Doing it this way, we get the insulation of wood and the easy cleaning of a glass tank.

      My wisdom tooth hurts much less this morning.  Actually, the gum hurts less.  The tooth is fine.  Also, I'm pretty sure that Gex would like to ride around on top of my head.  I wonder if they make leashes for geckos.

      Hmm.  I only post on Fridays or Saturdays.  For the most part anyway.  And no, Susie, I will not explain the blog title.    You know, all I have to do to be married to J is say I am.  That's because Kansas has "common law marriage."  This makes my job fun.  There's all sorts of myths out there about common law, the most common of which is the "live together for seven years and you're married" myth.  That's billshit, frankly.  To be considered common law in Kansas, a couple has to be (a) one man and one woman (which is shitty), (b) be of the legal age of consent, (c) represent each other as wife and husband, (d) live together, and do one or more of the following:  file joint income taxes, own property together, have a joint bank account, or name each other as beneficiaries of life insurance.  There are other things, too, but I can't remember them.  So essentially, you have to make at least a little effort to be considered common-law.  Common law is a holdover from the frontier days, when it was really hard for someone in East Jeebus to get to a magistrate or judge or minister in a timely fashion.  It still helps some people in isolated areas.  But mostly it's a pain in my ass.  The problem is that a lot of folks don't realize that in the eyes of the state (and of the insurance company), a common law marriage is just as binding as one with a marriage license.  YOU CAN'T CHANGE COMMON LAW SPOUSES ON A WHIM, PEOPLE!  To get another one, you have to legally divorce the first one.  Period.  I had to explain that at work today.  Hence the long post.

      I added some more pictures to the link in the first post.  My feet hurt.  I wore heeled shoes today, thinking it would be a sedentary day- Fridays usually are.  It's the day we update reports in our office.  However, today my computer crashed.  Totally.  As in, they had to reinstall Windows crashed.  IT tried to update one of the programs, but it didn't take.  So I was filing all day, putting together orientation packets, etc.  And now my feet hurt.  I need to go to Target but I don't wanna, so I think I'm going to go to bed.

      I've taking up the sport of fencing, Renaissance style.  In my backyard.  With J.  He used to fence a lot, before a falling out with his local group.  It's a shame, in my opinion, to let skills go to waste, so I asked him to teach me.  Although I haven't got any equipment yet.  That's later this week.

      Gex is found!  Thanks to the sheer stupidity of BeBe, he is fine- tail and toes intact, and just a bit pissed that his adventure has ended.  He got out when I left the top of his tank (he lives in a fish tank) to go fill his water dish.  Little did I know that my little lizard had ambitions of becoming a Marine.  The currently theory is that he did a "chin up" on the rim of the aquarium and climbed out.  I did not know he could do this.  Anyway, he was out for about 4 days.  We searched the whole bedroom for him, but there are lots of places for something the size of my hand to hide in there.  Then, last night he was spotted.  I put a towel across the bottom of the bedroom door to try to keep him in, or at least slow him down.  J had just emerged from the shower when he saw BeBe batting at the towel.  And there was Gex!  Fortunately, it was The Dumb One who spotted him, and not the smart one.  So now he's in a bigger tank (a 20 gallon fish tank that my parents weren't using) with more climbing things (all more than twice his length away from the top), burrowing things, and a mirror.  I'm relieved.

      I'm purling! Well, not right now, but just before now!  Woot!  I'm the bomb!  Or something!  My stupid lizard got out of his cage.  I don't know how.  He's a gecko, but not one of those that can climb on glass.  Stupid lizard.

      I just realized I spend waaaay too much time reading about reptiles, planning which ones I need to get next, etc. Why? I just finished reading One Good Thing, the part about the Glass Tower, and my first thought was: HEY!  The girl should get a bunch of Tokay geckos and harness herself to them! Tokay geckos easily run upside-down on glass, thanks to the magic of gecko toes.  Someday, I will sucessfully make a link.  Le sigh.

       Reptiles aren't things, dagnabit!   I have a pet lizard.  She's, a leopard gecko, to be precise.  This little cutie (because she is very cute) has been to the vet twice in the seven months I've had her.  Why?  She's my responsibility!  Many people, especially young people or their parents, buy reptiles as throwaway pets.  They're not, and they're more work than people think- I have two cats, and caring for my leopard gecko takes much more effort than looking after the two of them.  Why?  Cats and dogs are domesticated, and lizards aren't.  They've only been kept as pets and bred in captivity for the past 30-40 years; that breeding has focused on color and pattern, not docility.  Some animals, liked plumed basilisks (http://www.sundialreptile.com/basilisk-brandeau-4th.htm), have been captive bred for even less time.  Reptiles, even those sold as pets, are still essentially wild animals.  Some species can be tamed, some species can't.  Even within the "tameable" species, some individuals will never get used to the idea, and some will even grow to like it.  People underestimate the amount of money that has to be spent on a reptile if you want to keep it alive.  Necessities are:  some sort of cage (usually an aquarium-type glass cage for ease of view and especially of cleaning, must be big enough along reptile's preferred dimension to establish a thermal gradient), a lid for said cage to prevent escapes, lights (UV for daylight animals- these bulbs run $30-$40 and have to be replaced every six months or so), heat in addition to lights as needed (ceramic heat emitters, under-tank heat pads, NOT HOT ROCKS!!!!!), thermometers (at least two, one at each end of your thermal gradient), décor items, substrate (varies depending on what kind of animal you've got), food (live bugs, fresh veggies, stuff to feed the bugs), vitamins, vet care, reference books (so you can tell when the lizard needs to go to the vet, as in the wild a sick lizard is a dead lizard), hand sanitizer (they can carry salmonella), and a spray bottle.  This can run well over $200, depending on the species you're keeping and the cost of your tank (many pet shops will sell chipped aquariums at a discount- they can't hold water, but they're fine for reptiles).  If people want an easy and inexpensive pet, get tropical fish.  Reptiles take work, time, patience, and perseverance.

      Gah.  I'm working on a post about how REPTILES ARE NOT THINGS DAMNIT THEY ARE LIVING BREATHING ANIMALS!  But until then, here's a quiz, found via a link at the FrogBlog.  I'm Spain:        You're Spain!      You like rain on the plain, as well as interesting architecture and  a diverse number of races and religions. &nbsp;You like to explore a lot, but sailing,  especially in large groups, never really seems to work out for you. &nbsp;Beware of pirates  and dictators bearing bombs. &nbsp;And for heavens' sake, stop running around bulls!  &nbsp;It's just not safe!   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  href="http://bluepyramid.org">Blue Pyramid       Alternately, I am Togo!        You're Togo!      Small, quiet, and very insecure, you could hide in just about any  crowd. &nbsp;Even a crowd of one or two people. &nbsp;Even though you're virtually  anonymous anywhere you go, you could have been wealthy if people hadn't mistreated you  and taken your money. &nbsp;This is probably most of why you're insecure. &nbsp;But  some people who study you hard think you're cute, so maybe you should try to open up  a little.   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  href="http://bluepyramid.org">Blue Pyramid       And I'm Jurassic Park!       You're  Jurassic Park !   by Michael Crichton     You combine all the elements of a mad scientist, a brash philosopher, a humble researcher, and a money-hungry attracter of tourists. With all these features, you could build something monumental or get chased around by your own demons. Probably both, in fact. A movie based on your life would make millions, and spawn at least two sequels thatwouldn't be very good. Be very careful around islands.

        My Mother  I want to write a little about my mom.  Why?  I'm bored, and I haven't seen her since Christmas.    Sharon Osborne would be my mother if she was married to a British rock star.  My mom swears only slightly less than Ms Osborne.  They even have the same haircut and vaguely elfin look about them.  My mother's dream job would be to drive a dump truck.  Not just any dump truck, mind you, but a purple one with flames on the side.  If I ever win the lottery, I will buy her one and a large chunk of land on which to drive.  This would make her happy.  Mom's actually a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit.  I was born a month early (4lbs) and unable to suck.  Ever since, that's what she's wanted to do.  She went back to school when I was 12 and my youngest sister was 5.  She got her associates, passed the RN exam, and continued for her bachelor's.  Her goal was to finish her BS before I finished high school, and she did it by a semester.  Mom did home health mother-baby visits for a while.  She liked that.  It was scary sometimes, when she would go to the inner cities, run-down rural meth towns, really violent areas.  She would have to pass groups of tough-looking men with knives, guns, etc, on the way to the houses.  They would step aside, call her ma'am, thank her for what she did.  She was the first female graduate of her nursing school to   not   wear the stupid little white hat.  If the men didn't have too, she wasn't going to.  No-one since has been required to wear it.  Her other non-hospital job was as a school nurse.  She did sex ed there as part of her job.  She had to follow the school script, which was only a step above abstinence only.  However, the word got out that if you wanted the real information, all you had to do was ask.  She kept Planned Parenthood cards in her office, in case any student needed help.  She worked at the school for about a year, then went back to the hospital for the money.  So now she's back there, taking care of babies and mothers and fathers, easing the discomfort of the babies and comforting the parents, reassuring them everything will be OK, and having them over for dinner.  She sees healthy but small babies (feeder-growers), babies with birth defects, drug babies, alcohol babies, babies that are wanted, babies that are given up for adoption, babies whose mothers wanted to abort them but were talked out of it or couldn't afford it and now look forward to a life of poverty and abuse, since most of those mothers were using substances/in abusive relationships/abusive themselves/abused as children/extremely poor/already have 4 or 5 kids/can't afford birth control.  And that's why mom's pro choice.

      I had comments.  Then I changed the template and now they're gone.  Sigh.  I will have to put them back in.  I have a question.  If you don't have a commercial driver's license, why the heck would we hire you for a CDL position?  Gah.  That was 5 minutes of my life I'm never getting back.

       Acknowledging my privilege.   Privilege, in this context, essentially is being treated a certain way because of inborn/outward characteristics.  This is something I've been meaning to do for a while- get all of it down, on paper (so to speak).  So, here it is:  The List of Zoe's privilege: I'm white. I'm from a middle-class to upper middle class background I'm straight. I'm naturally thin. I look "normal"- I look like a woman "should." I'm not disabled. I suffer from no disease that would make it hard to get health insurance (well, except for asthma). I'm currently middle class. I went to college. My background is Christian, even though I'm not.  What does all this mean?  Well, since I'm white, I'm less likely to be targeted by the police or security agencies than someone who is African-American or Hispanic or Asian.  My middle class, vaguely Christian upbringing assured me that the people I saw on TV looked like me, acted like me, dressed like me- society is centered on people like me.  Well, the male version of me, anyway.  Since I'm straight, my relationships can be legally recognized, and I can hold hands or kiss my partner in public without fear.  I'm thin (NOT petite- I hate that word!) in a fat-phobic society, and because I look conventionally female, I don’t have to worry about transphobia.  I'm fairly healthy- no crippling medical bills for me!  My education assures that doors will open for me.  I won't say I'm not happy about all the benefits that I get simply for being who I am, but I wish more people got to share in them simply for being human.

      More How to do Stuff:  Gutloading Feeder Insects!  Feeder insects are bugs raised with the specific intent of feeding them to something else- in my case, a leopard gecko.  The two most common feeder insects are mealworms (which are actually beetle larvae) and crickets.  Mealworms are good because you can keep them in the fridge, where they can live for months without turning into beetles.  Crickets allow your animal the fun of chasing them down.  However, if you don't "gutload"- feed nutritous and vitamin/mineral rich food- your bugs, your animal won't get any real benefit from them.  Here's how I gutload my mealworms. 1.  Buy mealworms.  Sift them out of the wheat germ they're in and set aside. 2.  Put 1 part Repti-Cal and 1 part Herpti-Vite in the bottom of a container with a secure lid.  Exact directions on the jars- the amount depends on the size of your container.  Mine's a plastic jar with a screw on lid that used to have washed river rocks in it, and I use a teaspoon of each powder. 3.  Fill the container about 1/3 of the way with mult-grain baby cereal. 4.  In a mortar and pestle, grind 4 generous pinches of fish food flakes to a powder.  Add this to the container, put the lid on, and shake to mix. 5.  Add the worms. 6.  Add more cereal so the worms are covered and the jar is about half full. 7.  Put a slice of apple/potato/some other moist fruit/veggie OR a wet paper towel on the top to provide mositure. 8.  Let the worms eat for at least 24 hours at room tempurature before feeding to your animal.  Periodically sift the bedding/food to remove shed skin or clumps, and to keep track of how many worms you are using.

      I have always disliked Valentine's Day- even when I have an SO, like now.  It's so...commercial/fake/forced.  Although that doesn't stop me from going out and buying J a present.  I like buying presents.  It will probably be a fish tank to keep our future Bearded Dragon (Trog Dor) in.

      Part one in a series:  How to do Stuff!- How to Make Pizza Dough! You will need:  two bowls, one of which should be oven-safe, a wooden spoon, a clean towel, measuring cups/spoons, water (1 cup warm) flour (2-3 cups), a packet of yeast, salt (1/4 tsp), sugar (1 teaspoon) and olive oil (2 tablespoons). About 5 minutes before you start mixing, turn your oven on to 250 degrees.  Warm one of your bowls by running hot water over it and dry it out.  Empty the packet of yeast into the bowl.  Add the water and sugar.  Yeast likes sugar.  Stir it up.  Next, stir in one cup of flour until smooth.  Then add the salt and olive oil.  You can also add spices, such as garlic, at this point.  Stir it up until slimey and gooey.  Now, add the rest of your flour.  It's best to do this a half-cup at a time.  This is the trickey part.  Add enough flour that your can handle the dough, but it should still stick to your fingers.  For me, this is usually about 2.5 cups.  At this point, turn off the oven.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 10-15 minutes.  The dough should at this point be smooth and not absorbing more flour.  Get your other bowl.  Pour some more olive oil in it and smear it around to cover the sides.  Roll the dough ball around until it's covered in oil.  Cover the bowl with the towel and put it in the oven.  Let it rise as much as you want- more risings give a finer texture.  The good thing about pizza dough is that even if you screw it up, it's still tastey.  I've been making it since I was 12 or 13, so I have a good idea of how to tweak the amounts as I go.

      I got to push a car out of ditch this weekend!  It was great!  It was in Iowa!  Don't you wish you were me?  My friend Cat and I drove from Wichita to Iowa City to visit her cousin and stop off to see my sister on the way back.  We got there at about 3am on Saturday morning, got up at 7, and went to bed at 8 on Saturday night.  Left the cousin's at around 8am on Sunday, drove to my sister's college, took her to breakfast, and set out.  At this point it's barely raining.  All is well until just past Osceola- between there and the Grand River exit.  We hit a patch of ice in the left lane, skid forward and sideways towards a semi, miss the semi, spin around some more, and wind up in a ditch with the car perpendicular to the road.

I had to wear a skirt because the constant rubbing of my pants fabric on the bites was making them itch constantly.  We have no calamine or Benadryl cream or anything, so I am taking oral Benadryl and drinking coffee to stay awake.

      Don't read the link if serial killers give you nightmares.  They give me nightmares, but I can't get away from this.   urlLink BTK is back.  This scares me.  I don't plan on being alone in the house for a good bit of time.  My crossbow makes me happy.  As does my rather intimidating live-in fiance.  Well, he looks intimidating, anyway.  He's really a sweet, mushy, 8 year old boy with pretty pretty eyes and eyelashes that are just UNFAIR in the body of a 6'2" muscley , forklift-lifting,  construction worker.  With damn good aim.  And you know, it pisses me off that I should be put in this situation.  I shouldn't have to check my phone for a dial tone when I get home, or be comforted that I have a man to protect me, or be in fear in my house.  People should just not do that sort of thing.  Medieval pie update:  I have apples.  Will be going to the Spice Merchant for saffron and the special cinnamon.  Also must find pastry flower.  The supermarket near my house didn't carry it.  A trip to a ritzier part of town is in order.

      I like to make pie, too.  J's birthday was last week, and as we were  urlLink here  , he did not get the Traditional Homemade Birthday Dessert.  He didn't get one last year, either, as our ancient oven crapped out about 3 days before his birthday.  Now we have a new oven, so this weekend he will get PIE!  I've found a medieval Italian recipe, converted to modern measurements, that I want to try.  It's got apples for the filling and saffron in the crust.

      (Atocha is the biggest of the three bombed Spanish train stations).  I like to walk and look at interesting buildings.  A normal weekend or afternoon for me, when I was in Madrid, was to hop on the subway, ride somewhere interesting, and walk around for a couple of hours.  Atocha was one of my favorites.  It's a beautiful building on the outside, and it has a rain forest on the inside.  Very peaceful, very beautiful.  Or at least it was.  Now it's tainted.  I would ride to Atocha on a lazy Sunday and walk up the road to the Prado to look at some of the West's great works of art for free.  After an hour or so dodging tourists and looking at my favorite paintings, I would leave to wander around and look at the buildings.  I would walk for miles.  Some days, I would go back to Atocha, buy a newspaper or read a book I'd brought with me, and read it in the garden.  I don't think I could do that now.  The place has been damaged, the calm has been shattered, my memories have been destroyed.  And I still haven't been able to call Consuelo, my Madrid mom.  Stupid time difference.

      Terrorists attacked Madrid trains today, killing almost 200 and wounding over 1,000. Paz si, ETA no!  I used to live in Madrid.  I used the Atocha station many times.  I have friends there.  Fortunately, none of them are on the preliminary injured list.  That doesn't mean anything.  If anyone reads this, please send prayers/thoughts/hopes/good wishes to Consuelo, Raquel, Carlos, Pilar, Esteban, Marina, and all the other madrilenos.

      Reptiles, that is.  It is my opinion that desert dwelling reptiles make much better pets (or at least pets that are easier to care for).  Why?  First off, they don't require the humidity that tropical herps do.  Cleaning up poop in a moist environment is a pain, and you have to do it way more often.  Desert poop, if you go away for the weekend, you don't have to worry about it contaminating the entire enclosure.  In a tropical terrarium, the high humidity will not allow the poop to dry out, which means it is more prone to spreading around the enclosure.  Plus, maintaining a constant 80% humidity (or whatever) while allowing adequate ventilation is a pain, especially in the winter when the ambient air is constantly being dried out.  Have you ever spent a night in a desert area?  It cools down there.  This is good for the herp keeper, because it corresponds with the ambient household temperatures.  Also, many of the commonly-kept desert dwellers come from places with cool seasons (bearded dragons and leopard geckos come to mind).  Again, this can work to our advantage, as these animals can be cooled slightly in the winter.  This is not to say that you can turn off all the heating apparatus, but that you don't have to keep the enclosure at "optimum" (eight to ninety degrees) temperature year round.  In fact, these animals often won't breed without a cooling period.  Finally, the decor is easier.  Naturalistic decor for a jungle herp involves lots of places for crickets and other feeder bugs to hide.  This is bad, because many reptiles hunt by sight- if they can't see it, they won't eat it.  Also, feeder insects that are turned loose in a terrarium loose their nutritional value if not provided with food, and they may even eat your herp!  We don't want that, do we?  I will admit that I'm prejudiced- I keep desert reptiles, and I love them.  But still.

      I barbequed last night.  Almost didn't, since the stupid neighborhood punks stole our charcol.  I guess keeping it on the front porch is not the best storage idea.  Oh well.  There's got to be some sort of life metaphor in BBQ, but I don't know what it is.  Normally, I don't like to toot my own horn, but I am a damn fine griller.  I get a lot of practice, since we don't have AC (just room units in the bedroom/computer room).  It is simply too hot to be cooking indoors in the Kansas summers, so everything is done on the grill.  Meats, veggies, potatoes, mushrooms, everything.  And it's yummy.

      Pasta Briciolata (traditional Italian pastry), as modified by Heather Mosey for a medieval Italian recipe.    This makes a top and bottom crust, or a thick bottom crust.  It can be used with any sort of pie filling.  The recipe calls for a 375° oven, but it works in a 350° oven as well.  ¼ cup pastry flour ¾ cup all-purpose flour 4 oz (one stick) sweet unsalted butter Pinch of salt Pinch of saffron, minced 4-5 tablespoons of cold water Clean, damp towel  1.	Sift the flour onto a board and shape into a mound.  Cut the butter and arrange the slices over the flour.  Let rest for ½ hour or until the butter softens. 2.	Mix the butter and flour together using your hands. 3.	Make a well and add the salt and saffron.  Add 2 tablespoons of water, mix with a fork, and keep adding water until it is all absorbed. 4.	Form the dough into a ball and knead gently for about 2 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.  If you are making a top and bottom crust, divide the dough into two parts, one slightly larger than the other.  Wrap the balls in the towel and put them in the refrigerator for at least one hour. 5.	Dust the board with flour.  Unwrap the dough and knead it for one minute.  Then, roll the dough into a circle (or circles, if you’re making a top/bottom crust pie). 6.	Carefully transfer the bottom crust to a greased pie pan, fill it with yumminess, and add the top layer, if there is one.

      It's slowed down at work, so I can get caught up on MY work that I wasn't able to do because I was helping people do THEIR work.  Oh, and post to the blog, too.  This weekend will be rainy and cold so I will finally put up that pie recipe, too.  And maybe, just maybe, the Barbeque Chicken that Daddy Makes recipe.

      Well, not just stomach flu...digestive trouble (both ends) combined with chills and sweats and ending with me flat on my back on the bathroom floor in a sleeping bag, flannel nightgown, several blanks, writhing in pain and cold and being carried to bed.  And J taking the next day (Monday) off work to stay home.  It wasn't a mosquito, it was a spider.

      I think I want to change my template again.  This one worries me.  Also, I haven't put my links back.   Last weekend we purchased the special UV light and fixture for Trog Dor.  We have the vivarium, it just needs furnished.  Oh, and more heating fixtures- beardies like their temperatures up around 100, and it only gets tp about 90 in my house.

      The "when are you going to start a family" question, that is.  People ask when J and I are getting married, and then ask when we plan to "start a family."  We generally reply that our family already exists, but that we will be official on March 12th.  This, of course, is not what they mean.  These people want to know about kids.  They have the idea that the only valid family is one with kids, which is definitely   not   true.  I don't want kids.  I never have.  I like other people's well-behaved kids.  They go home with their parents every night and I go home to spend time with J.  That's what I want out of life.  I don't want to be legally responsible for someone else's welfare for 18 years.  I want to go on vacations, keep lots of interesting reptiles, share my house with my cats, spend time alone with J, get plenty of sleep, have some extra money, start my own wine making business... all things that would be very difficult if I was stuck with a child.  So leave me alone- not having kids is a perfectly valid life choice, and J and I are a family.

      And the reader is thinking, "Duh, Zoe, in their cage!" .  That's not what I meant.  I'm thinking of geographical location- which room of the house is best? There are a few things to consider: 1.  Temperature.  The room should be heated in the winter.  AC in the summer is nice and helpful at maintaining a year-round ambient temperature (which makes your life easier), but not essential.   2.  Electrical outlets.  You need lots of them.  Or at least one you can use with a power strip. 3.  Ability to be closed off.  In case of an escape, or in case the power goes off in the winter, it helps to be able to close the door to the room to either keep the repitle inside (easier to find) or keep the heat inside.  Also, this is important if you have small children, pets, or other potential stressors in your family. 4.  Accessibility.  A good deal of successful reptile keeping relies on observation, so you need to keep your pet in a room that you will be able to enter and exit on a regular basis.  So there you have it.  My herps live in my bedroom and the guest room.

      Sara now goes on my links, when I get a chance (when I get around to posting from home again).  I'm having an ucky blood sugar day, so sorry about typos.  abortion  Abortion should be safe, legal and rare.  By rare, I don't mean hard to get- it should be easy to get, but most unecessary.  Contraceptives should be subsidized for low-income people and easy to get.  the death penalty  Only for mass murders.  prostitution  Go after the pimps and the johns.  Reduce the demand through education about the problems of prostitutes, and the supply by training prostitutes to find other work.  Those who can't get out should be provided with condoms and physical exams to try to keep them healthy.  alcohol  Lower the drinking age and don't portray drinking as something that happens at cool parties.  Make it like drinking coffee- it just happens.  Not glamorus, not exciting. (Originally, this said "raise the drinking age).  It should be legal for those under the legal age to consume alcohol with the consent of their parents, as long as no laws are broken, ie public intoxication or drunk driving.  marijuana  Should be legal.  other drugs  Legalize some, keep others (like heroin) illegal.  Educate on the real risks of drug abuse and real-world strategies for avoidance.  Provide rehab instead of jail to addicts, along with coping strategies and job training.  gay marriage  Civil unions for all- no state marriage.  Eliminate most of the economic benefits of marriage.  Keep the next-of-kin stuff, though.  Civil unions/marriage are for forming a new family, not a tax break.  illegal immigrants  Make immigration easier.  Work to improve living conditions in countries that are losing their people to immigration.    smoking  As a smoke-sensitive asthmatic, I'm picky on this.  I have no problem with making restaurants/bars smoke-free or requiring a smoking area complete seperate from the rest of the facility.  I haven't been to a bar in 3 years because of the smoke.  drunk driving  Bad.  cloning  Use it to grow replacement organs but not whole people/animals.  I have no rational basis for that, however.  racism  Bad.  No idea how to make it go away.  premarital sex  Go for it, but use birth control/condoms.  And please, wait till you're out of high school.  But I can't make you.  religion  Not my bag, but everyone has a right to both be religious and be free of religion.  the war in Iraq  Bad.  However, we broke it, and we need to arrange for it to be fixed.  George W. Bush  Like a chimpanezee, only not as cute and not as smart.  downloading music  It's fine by me to download a few songs.  However, if you want the whole CD, go buy it.  the legal drinking age  Should be lower.  porn  Against, but I don't think it should be illegal.  We need a cultural shift so women aren't used as the sex toys of men.  suicide  Everything in our power should be done to prevent it, for both the sake of the person and those they would leave behind.

      I have almost finished my blue jumper dress made out of a sari I bought of Ebay.  The sari helps to offset the inherent kindergarten-teacherness of a jumper.  I like jumpers.  I can wear them over shirts I couldn't otherwise wear to work because they are too tight/low-cut/see-through etc.  Plus, jumpers are comfy.  Apparently, when I was five, I wouldn't wear anything but dresses.  My parents' preferred punishment at that time was to make me wear pants.  Then I went through the no-dresses-not-ever phase.  Now, I wear them from time to time.  Instant outfit- no trying to find pants to go with that shirt.  And in the winter, I get to wear my lovely flannel petticoat.  Deep down, I'm 80, I think.

      OK, maybe not the absolute worst, but pretty dang bad.  A few nights ago, there was a big Kansas thunderstorm.  We were awakened by a thunderclap- the kind that sounds like 3 cannons going off at the house next door.  I rolled over to go back to sleep and...my hand got wet as the window was leaking.  Why was the window leaking?  Because Jeremy has not cleaned the gutters out in the entire time he's lived in our house- four or so years worth of crap was clogging them up.  In last night's storm, it happened again, and the Boy was out there standing on a chair in a downpour emptying the gutters.

She went straight from living in a dorm.  So, what you have here are 2 people who have no idea how to live by themselves, one of them is passionatly in love with the other while that person would prefer to hang out watching movies to having sex.  But wait!  Now, she might be pregnant!  Yay!  That can only make things that much more fun!

      I work in HR, and generally, I like it.  However, today I had to turn away two guys who did not have the legal right to work in this country.  I hate it.  They've been working here for years, and they had the bad luck to try to work for a company that actually knows how to spot fake IDs, and there's nothing I can do to help.  Jeremy's (I've gotten tired of calling him J) been working a lot lately.  Of course, he's working for 3 companies (the one he's been at for 6 years, his uncle's recently started company, and his brother's quasi under-the-table company).  He hasn't worked for the "main" company in weeks, and will probably turn in his resignation soon.  His uncle will pay him $1 more an hour for now, and Jeremy will be the first foreman when the company begins to expand.  Main boss is not out busting his butt to get the contracts, and that simply does not fly in construction.  The bad thing is Jeremy's been doing more work with wood than with steel, which makes him cranky.  The good thing is his uncle respects his abilities and treats him like a competant adult, something that was lacking at his previous job.

      It blows my mind how many people right here in the heart of tornado alley aren't planning on how to protect their pets in the event of severe weather.  If you have pets, you really ought to plan what you will do in the event of severe weather. Of course, this includes our reptilian friends.  Here's what I do: I start getting ready to go into the safest part of my house (the hallway- I live in Kansas and have no basement) as soon as it gets to a tornado warning.  Cat carriers and reptile carriers come out.  The reptiles go in modified shoeboxes (holes poked in lids).  It's not elegant, and it's not the best place to keep them, but it's portable and easy to carry.  When Trog Dor gets bigger, he will have his own carrier.  That's it really, for tornadoes.  I always have mealworms and frozen veggies on hand in case the power goes out.

      Trogdor is burninating about 36 crickets a week (in addition to the veggies, nastursiums, and mealworms).  Well, not really a week- more like Tuesday night through Saturday.  Gex helps some.  Because of this, I am thinking of signing up for a "cricket contract" where the little nasties are delivered weekly.  The problem with this is that someone has to be home to accept them, and I do NOT want the gross disgusting little beasties to come to work.  If they were delivered to work I would have to leave work and transfer the things from the shipping container to the cricket house (a nifty little clear plastic box with a lid and little black textured tube for them to hide in).  I don't want to do that.  So it seems I am at an impass, and that Troggie will be getting mealworms on those days when all the crickets are gone.  One of my cats, Tarki, was bitten by one of the other ones (probably BeBe, but I'm not sure).  She had an abcess, which burst at home.  All over my hand, in fact.  It was pretty much the grossest thing ever.  Now she's got a shaved spot on her back and an Elizabethan collar, which she can take off if we don't put it on right.  This also means that yours truly must get up at 6am with the boy to throw antibiotics down the cat's throat, which is so not fun.  Sigh.  What I do for my animals.

      I have a very conflicted relationship with roses.  I don't like to receive them, but I like to smell them and have them around.  Getting a gift of roses just seems so artificial- the giver didn't take the time to find out I prefer tulips, daisies, sunflowers, irises, or orchids.  They (well, usually he)just did what's expected.  Also, the commonly available colors of florist roses just don't do anything for me, and the scent isn't great.  Not to mention the human rights issues of the workers on the rose plantations of South America.  Despite all this, there is very little that can make me happier faster than cutting a just-opening bloom off the small "Peace" rose that grows in my backyard, burying my nose in the super-soft petals, and breathing in that luscious but not overwhelming scent.  Taking my shears out back and cutting the stem just so, so two blossoms will grow for the one I cut is an amazing thing.  To see this plant making such simple beauty and knowing I helped is quite the reward.  Now, I don't believe in those fancy-schmancy rose treatments.  Number one reason is that Jeremy and I make wine out of our rose petals and most of the treatments specifically for roses aren't safe to eat.  Also, many rose problems can be controlled through organic means- a strong jet of water once or twice a day will take care of mosts pests, organic fertilizer works just as well and is free to cheap (if you have friends who have pet cows like I do), and most rose diseases can be prevented by allowing the leaves to dry and pruning the diseased parts back.  It seems to be working- my climber is huge- as in, I will have to get on the roof and cut it back soon- and the little hybrid tea in the backyard is thriving.  Although the flowers don't like the 100-degree days very much.

      I'm not a native Kansan, and I like to pick on my adopted home.  But it does have its charms.  For the 4th of July the boy and I drove to St. Louis.  The route takes you through some of the only hills in this flatter-than-a-pancake state.  (Proof  urlLink  ) The landscape is almost Martian in the winter, but in spring and summer it turns all green and gets covered in cows.  The sky goes on forever.  There was a storm rolling in, all black and towering and melding with the white fluffy clouds and the blue sky...  It was good.

      All the festivals across the state are named after a fruit, vegetable, or grain.  Down south means Oklahoma.  Everyone in your family has been on a "float trip" before.  In August, you break a sweat the instant you step outside at 7:00 a.m.  A Mercedes Benz is not a status symbol. A Ford F10 4x4 is. (Except in Johnson County)  More than once you've made a beer run to another state.  The terms Sooners and Huskers cause hairs on the back of your neck to stand up straight and your blood pressure to rise.  A tornado warning siren is your signal to go out in the yard and look for a funnel.  A traffic jam is two drivers staring each other down at a four-way stop, each determined to be the most polite and let the other go first.  Traffic congestion is ten cars waiting to pass a combine on the highway.  Using the elevator involves a wheat truck.  A short trip means going to Hutch to the fair or to Abilene to Ike's museum.  A long vacation means going to Silver Dollar City, Worlds of Fun.  Without thinking, you wave to all oncoming traffic.  You are not surprised to find movie rentals, ammunition and bait all in the same store.  You can properly pronounce Basehor, Cimmeron, Schoenchen, Kechi, Chautauqua, Arkalalah, and Osawatomie.  You can see the grain elevator in the next town, which is 20 miles away.  You can tell it's a farmer working late in his field and not a UFO.  You carry jumper cables in your car and make sure your better half knows how to use them.  You design your kid's Halloween costume to fit over a snowsuit.  You discover that in July it takes only 2 fingers to drive your car.  You don't buy all your vegetables at the grocery store.  You don't have to ask, "What's a Jayhawk?"  You end sentences with an unnecessary preposition. Example: "Where's my coat at?"  You failed geography because you thought Peru, Havana, Manhattan, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Cuba were only cities in Kansas.  You go to Wal-Mart for your Saturday shopping, and look forward to it  You had at least one summer job that was bucking bales or custom cutting.  You have been asked, "Where is Toto?" more than once.  You have never met any celebrities. (Bob Dole isn't a celebrity; he's your neighbor.)  You have owned at least one belt buckle bigger than your fist.  You install security lights on your house and garage and then leave both unlocked.  You instantly know someone is from Johnson County when they call everything west of Topeka "Western" Kansas.  You know everything goes better with Ranch.  You know how spell "wash" but it still comes out "warsh" when spoken.  You know in your heart that K-State can beat Oklahoma in football.  You know several people who have hit a deer.  You know a few people who have hit more than one deer.  You know that the true value of a parking space is not determined by the distance to the door but by the availability of shade.  You know the difference between field corn and sweet corn, while still on the stalk.  You know the 4 seasons as: summer, road construction, still summer, winter.  You know the words to "Home on the Range."  You know what's knee-high by the Fourth of July.  You know which leaves make good toilet paper  You like sitting on the porch in the middle of the summer during a thunderstorm.  You lock the doors to your truck but leave the windows rolled down.  You measure distance in minutes rather than miles.  You no longer associate bridges or rivers with water.  You only own 3 spices: salt, pepper, and ketchup.  You pronounce Arkansas differently when speaking of the state or river.  You really do think Sunflowers are beautiful.  You see a car running in the parking lot with no one in it no matter what time of the year.  You see people wear bib overalls at funerals.  You see people wearing hunting clothes at social events.  You think ethanol makes your truck "run a lot better."  You think of the major food groups as beer, beef, beans and Jell-O salad.  You think people who complain about the wind and weather in their states are SISSIES!  You think sexy lingerie is white tube socks and a flannel shirt.  You think that opening day of the deer season should be a national holiday.  You think the opening day of pheasant season is a national holiday.  You went to skating parties as a kid.  You'll pay for your kids to go to college...unless they want to go to OU or NU.  Your earliest driving lessons were in a field while picking up hay.  Your excuse for being late is the cows got out, and the boss accepts it  Your main drag in town is two blocks long.  Your school classes were canceled because of cold.  Your school classes were canceled because of heat.  You're totally unfazed by a squadron of B1 bombers flying overhead.  You've ever had to switch from "heat" to "A/C" in the same day.  You've ever said, "It's not the heat, it's the humidity."  You've ridden the school bus for an hour each way.  You've seen all the biggest bands but ten years after they were popular.  FINALLY...you are 100% Kansan if you actually understand these jokes and forward them to all your friends from Kansas.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- That slope-shouldered farm boy did more work before breakfast than you'll do all week at the gym. How'd you like to go home and tell your momma you got your butt kicked by a guy in bib overalls?  It's called a 'gravel road.' No matter how slow you drive, you're going to get dust on your BMW. I have a four wheel drive because I need it. Drive it or get it out of the way.  We all started hunting when we were nine years old. Yeah, we saw Bambi. We got over it.  Any references to "corn fed" when talking about our women will get your butt kicked...by our women.  Go ahead and bring your $600 Orvis Fly Rod. Don't cry to us if a flathead breaks it off at the handle. We have a name for those little 13-inch trout you fish for...bait.  Pull your pants up. You look like an idiot.  If that cell phone rings while a bunch of mallards are making their final approach, we will shoot it. You might hope you don't have it up to your ear at the time.  That's right. Whiskey is only two bucks. We can buy a fifth for what you paid in the airport for a shot.  The Jayhawks and the Wildcats are as important here as the Lakers and the Knicks...and a dang sight more fun to watch.  No, there's no "Vegetarian Special" on the menu. Order steak. Order it rare. Or, you can order the Chef's Salad and pick off the two pounds of ham and turkey. Yeah, we have sweet tea. It comes in a glass with two packets of sugar and a long spoon.  You bring Coke into my house, it better be brown, wet, and served over ice.  So you have a sixty-thousand dollar car. We're real impressed. We have quarter of a million dollar combines that we only use two weeks a year.  Let's get this straight. We have one stoplight in town. We stop when it's red. We may even stop when it's yellow.  Our women hunt, fish, and drive trucks-because they want to. So, you're a feminist. Isn't that cute.  Yeah, we eat catfish, carp and turtle. You really want sushi and caviar? It's available at the bait shop.  They are pigs. That's what they smell like. Get over it. Don't like it? Interstate 70 goes two ways - 35 goes the other two. Pick one.  The "Opener" refers to the first day of pheasant season. It's a religious holiday held the closest Saturday to the first of November. You can get breakfast at the church.  So every person in every pickup waves. It's called being friendly. Understand the concept?  Yeah, we have golf courses. Don't hit in the water hazards. It spooks the fish.  No, we can't shoot the meadowlarks. They're song birds. Okay, even we feel a little stupid about that one.  Now, enjoy your visit and then go home

      St. Louis when... You like your bar-b-que cooked and immersed in sauce (Kansas City style) instead of roast beef with sauce on the side!  The first question you ask someone upon meeting them is, "So, where did you go to high school?"  You contemptuously denounce other areas for their accents, and then proceed to say "Warshington," "farty-far (44)," "yer," and "in/un (and)" without even realizing it.  You watch actors like John Goodman, Scott Bakula, Scott Foley, or Kevin Kline, just because "they're one of us."  You're used to streets that: a) end in one place and start up again half a mile down (i.e. Conway, McKnight), b) change names back and forth (Ashby, Warson, Lindbergh, Kirkwood), or c) run across highway entrance/exit ramps (Florissant, Hazelwood).  You expect every city to have towns/streets whose name ends in  "wood."  You've ever fought with someone over the origin of toasted ravioli.  On a tour of St. Louis, you take out-of-towners to Ted Drewes.  Period.  You recognize the name Cervantes but don't know much about it beyond that.  You make analogies between the Pope's Visit and Mark McGwire's home runs or the "Monday Night Miracle."  You consider a yellow light an indicator that you should speed up,  not stop.  You still resent Kansas City because of the '85 World Series.  You wonder why anyone would eat Chili Mac on macaroni instead of spaghetti.  You are baffled when you hear the correct pronunciations of  "Choteau,"  "Gravois," and "Soulard."  You respond to "Across the river" by asking "Which river?".  You cried when Mark McGwire hit more home runs than Sammy Sosa, not because the record was broken, but because St. Louis had bested Chicago.  You still have Mike Keenan's picture on your dartboard.  You always thought that the Archdiocese got its name from the Arch.  You say "St. Louis style pizza" instead of "thin crust."  You know what a Billiken really is.  You brag about our world champion Rams and baseball Cardinals, and you deny that the football Cardinals ever made their home here.   Kansas: You never met any celebrities. (Bob Dole isn't a celebrity; he's your neighbor.)    You know the meaning of Rock Chalk Jayhawk.    Your closest neighbor is more than a mile away, and you can still see him from your front porch.    You know exactly what calf fries are, and eat them anyway.    A traffic jam involves two cars staring each other down at a four-way stop, each determined to be the most polite and let the other go first.    A Mercedes Benz is not a status symbol. A Ford F150 4x4 is. (Except in Johnson County)    The terms Sooners, Huskers and Missouri Tigers cause the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up straight and your blood pressure to rise.    You have owned at least one belt buckle bigger than your fist.    You are not surprised to find movie rentals, ammunition and bait all in the same store.    You know that the true value of a parking space is not determined by the distance to the door but by the availability of shade.    You have been asked, "Where is Toto" more than once.    You learned how to shoot a gun before you learned how to multiply.    Traffic congestion is ten cars waiting to pass a combine on the highway.    You have had to switch from heat to A/C in the same day.    You know everything goes better with Ranch.    You have seen people wear bib overalls to funerals and weddings and on the golf course.    You have ridden the school bus for more than an hour each way.    A tornado-warning siren is your signal to go out in the yard and look for a funnel.    You know the real way to pronounce the name of Clintons state and the river... arKANSAS.    "Vacation" means going to Kansas City or Wichita for the weekend.    You measure distance hours.    You know several people who have hit more than one deer.    You install security lights on your house and garage and leave both unlocked.    It takes you 3 hours to go to the store for one item, even when you're in a rush, because you have to stop to talk to everyone in town.    You call that smell coming from the feed yards ... Money.

      (This is a herp post)  First, a PSA:  Dear Jerkface, If you order two geckos, please don't leave them sitting at the post office for 2 days!  That's not very nice.  Second:  The Point The point is, taking proper care of a reptile involves a lot of research, pre and post purchase.  Obviously, first you have to decide what type of herp appeals to you:  snakes, lizards, frogs, whatever.  I like lizards, followed by snakes.  Then you'll need to limit yourself to a few species.  Ideally, a beginner should pick a species that is readily available, captive-breed, and not too pricey (it's best to start with something inexpensive until you get the hang of reptile keeping).  Next, break out the books.  You'll find info online, at the libary, at the zoo...it's all out there.  You should look for information about the herp's natural habitat (where in the world is it found, is it a desert animal or tropical, etc), about captive keeping (temperature, size of enclosure, need for UV lighting, food), and temperment (handleable or not).  So now you should know which species best suits you.  Dont ever buy something just because it's cool- you must know how to care for it properly.  If you don't do your research, your herp will die.  Period.  You must know at the minimum, the basics- heat, light, food, water, humidity, size of enclosure.  Once you bring your new pet home, don't stop researching.  Keep up with the latest info on the species.  However, now's the time to learn through observation.  All reptiles are different, and all have different needs.  Assuming you've set up your tank correctly, deviations from the norm are probably just the way your dragon is.  If it's eating, pooping, and shedding on a regular basis, it's likely OK.  You can learn what food your herp prefers- does the beardie like nastursiums better than collards for instance.  Also, by handling your herp regularly (if it will tolerate it), you can keep a better eye on it's health.
