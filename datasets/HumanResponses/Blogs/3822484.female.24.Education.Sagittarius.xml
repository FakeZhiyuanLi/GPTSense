      I do not enjoy my life.  At least not much.  I'm following the "shoulds".  I'm falling into the pit of the "musts," "needs," and "have-to's."  I working 8-5 at a job that I don't enjoy because I "must" earn a paycheck, I "need" to have health insurance, and I "have-to" pay the rent.  I "need" to be able to buy groceries, and to put gas in my car.  So I'm spending the majority of my waking life in an office with no windows, at an unfulfilling job, where I'm asked to take on * much * more work than any human being could handle, because I don't have a college degree and I "have-to" make a living somehow.    Now, onto the "shoulds."  I'm 24 years old.  I'm very bright.  The job I'm in is unfulfilling in large part because it bores me.  I want to be doing something more with my life, but I'm not sure what.  I like English, writing more than reading, although I do like reading, too.  I like art.  I like helping people.  I've thought about teaching, writing, psychology, art therapy, and law as potential careers.  The careeer debate has been going through my mind for about 8 years.  I just am not sure what I want.  All of the above interest me, none ignite me, all scare me - what if I go through school for this and end up FREAKING BORED AND HATING IT?!    Anyway, though, because I'm at a crappy job and see no other way out, I'm busting my ass to get a degree in something.  Anything.  I'm taking 12 credit hours a semester after work, staying up late doing homework, getting up early to go to work, never having time to work out or eat healthy, and definitely not enough time to get a good night's sleep - all because I want to get the hell out of this job and move on as fast as possible.  I only hope it's worth it.    To make matters worse, I work at a university.  My co-workers are a couple of ladies who are approaching their 60s, and who have been working at this university for about 15 years.  They, like myself, do not have degrees.  This is a low-paying, dead-end job, in an environment where there is constant pressure and competition to move higher and perform better.  I am 24 years old, working towards my AA degree. I went to a university straight out of high school, but ended up taking a couple of years off, since I didn't want to waste my money in school when I didn't know what I wanted anyway.  I currently advise graduate students with regards to their academic plans of study.  They are usually a year or two younger than I am, and about to leave college with a master's degree in a field they love, making 46k a year.  I make 22k.  I ADVISE these people.  I compare myself to them, mentally.  And I put the pressure on myself, you know?  " I  should be getting my master's by now;  I  should have a clue about what I want to do with my life;  I  should be working harder, I GOTTA PRODUCE, GOTTA PRODUCE..."    I'm driving myself crazy.    I have an amazing, wonderful, gorgeous man in my life.  He is so very supportive and proud of my hard work.  He is 29 years old.  He wants to get his Ph.D. before getting married.  I want to know what the hell I'm going to do with my life before I get married.  BUT....I don't want to wait that long.   When will I get to be with the man I love?  When will I get to stop killing myself with work?  When will I have a job I enjoy?  And feel proud of myself again?  And when do I get to sleep?  And when can I finally be NOT-STRESSED, so these damn pimples can go away?   When will life get fun?
