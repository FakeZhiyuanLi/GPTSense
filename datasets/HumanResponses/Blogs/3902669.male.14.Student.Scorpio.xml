      By this time next week, most of my friends are going to be gone. All of them are going to camp, vacation, or some shit like that. It's really distressing. Yesterday was extremely fun. I want to do that all the time, but summer is almost over and it sucks =( Hmm and now my mom wants me to start another sport again because she claims I'm getting fat (even though I am 139 lbs people!!) My mom is overreacting, and my life is getting really depressive again. Someone help me.

      I learned that Ryan, Chad, Jess, John, Aubrey, and Alli entertained themselves at the beach today. Do I feel left out? Yes. Should I feel left out? No. I definitely shouldn't feel like that because I was invited. It's just that I am sick. See how confusing I am! Well I succeeded in spreading the germs to my mom, who in turn said 'thank you'. Haha..I'm sure she appreciates it. Hopefully my dad won't get sick. At this time in my life, I'm feeling very incomplete. I am grateful that I quit karate, but at the same time I feel like I didn't finish my time there (which I didn't.) I do nothing all day, I barely work out anymore, and I feel like I'm just wasting away. At least when I went to karate I had something to do. Hell I even had a job!! Do I regret leaving karate? No. I had to leave at one point or another. Doing the same thing every single day, and having drill sergeants shout and push you at the same time is not fun. I'm still waiting for Aubrey to dye my hair green! I think it's going to look so kick ass, even though I know my parents will hate it. Hey, thats what teenagehood is about isn't it ;-)

      My mom was right last night (moms always are). She told me I wasn't going to be able to go to the beach, and she sure was right. I woke up today at 7:30 and I felt like shit. I just had to cancel with Jess and the crew. If I had gone, I would have probably puked in the water, or my nose would of got so clogged up that I would die of suffocation. I wonder if the crew even went. Today wasn't the best day to go. This cold thing is not cool. For example, yesterday I was going to go to Christ Church with Ryan and Chad, but Ryan got worse (so did I) so we couldn't go. Sometimes I feel like the Christ Church youth group is one big cult. Last time I went with Ryan and Felix, and all the kids looked brainwashed. The 'headmaster' came up to me and asked for my name. When I did, everyone turned around and said a big 'HELLLLLO Bryan'. That was a tad freaky. And then of course, theres the singing. God, I didn't know how long I could stand that monotone singing of theirs. Well that's just an opinion. The Warped Tour is going to be awesome this year!! Although I still haven't bought my tickets yet =( It is on the same day as the Black Belt Extravaganza [July 31st], which I was invited to by Mrs. LaVallee herself. I'm still sort of debating whether I should go or not, or whether I will even have enough time to make it. It just happens to be on the bestest concert of the year, which I wouldn't miss for the world. It should be interesting to see how everyone reacts by me returning. I'm not sure if they'll be open arms or just pure assholes. You never know with the LaVallees..I have to take another pill of that Sudafed crap. Peace I'm out.

      Hey all you fans. Haha, first post. I was getting tired of livejournal anyways. It's always good to get a breath of fresh air. Today I did.....nothing, just like its been for the past two weeks. Oh what fun =) Well Chadwick told me that I shouldn't need an invite. I should just invite myself because we're all that close. That made me feel way better about everything. Other than that, I watched Big Fish with my mom in the morning, then I watched Euro Trip with my parents (not a good idea kids!) Those nude scenes were great, but whats not great is getting a boner in front of your mom! Haha, yeah embarrasing but that movie was ok. I'm still sick with Ryan and Felix's never ending passing of the dreaded cold. Seems like I contracted the stuffy nose part of it. Two days ago I had a soar throat. Damn you Ryan! Well rather..damn you Felix (he started it ;) Tomorrow I'm planning on going to the beach with the crew. The twins and Sam cancelled at the last minute. Whatever forget them. My mom doesn't want me to go, but isn't the beach good for your sinuses and whatnot?? Well should be an interesting day. Peace in the middle east.
