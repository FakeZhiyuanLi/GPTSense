      Here's a thought:  The human eye doesn't really detect motion. It takes lots of snapshots, fairly quickly (30-60 times a second (hertz)) and the brain puts them together allowing the brain to percieve motion. Now, if motion is only about being-still-in-different-places-quickly (if you get my meaning  urlLink ;P ) whose to say it doesn't apply to the universe (and not just the brain and its appparent perception of motion). Aaah lemme just get to the point. I'm thinking that it might be possible that the whole universe operates on a "refresh rate" (ala CRT screens, tv's, etc) but that it's so incredibly fast/high, that it is (probably, but hopefully not) impossible to detect. Now when I first stumbled across this thought, I figured that this might explain that the speed of light is what it is, and no faster.  To get to that explanation, I should elaborate on the idea of a universal refresh rate. Slow down time, in fact stop it completely. Now everything stands still yes? Alright, now go forward in time, but as little as possible ( 0.000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds forward(the base time between two updates(relating to the refresh-rate idea) or whatever) (assuming my theory is reasonable, you could do this, or the interval would be infinitely small(maybe it is?)[this is haard to explain]). Now after having moved forward, what has happened? Everything has changed state. The whole universe has, very very minutely, but definitely, changed/moved. It didn't move however, it just 'popped' forward a little (like looking at consecutive frames of a movie reel), the point being that there was no 'in-between', it was either here or there. Now, onto the idea of the speed of light.  I haven't thought it out fully yet, but hear me out. If light moved at an infinite speed, it wouldn't be detectable. If it had moved an infinite distance, in each consecutive frame (of the universe's refresh rate) then no one would actually see light, because it had already passed by (?) [erf, think I've lost the plot a bit here, but ONWARDS! :/] . It seems that 'movement(displacement, changing of states, whatever) takes place between frames, and that the occurence of each frame has a limiting effect that light can travel in the gap between frames, thus making it detectable and visible. Bear in mind that throughout this whole explanation, you have to assume that we (anything in the universe that is) can only percieve each frame(or update) and not the time/space in between each update, so to us it would seem like there is no such thing as a refresh rate. Aside from the fact that it's happening so quickly that it seems like fluid motion or life occuring and that that's why we cant detect this 'refresh rate'. That doesn't really have to be the case however, because if there was say any huge amount of time between each frame, who would be the wiser? We can't percieve anything happening between 'updates' anyway.  In a wierd way you can sort of rationalise this whole idea, but I wonder if it actually has any use. Besides which, there are probably lots of ideas and theories that can poke holes in (read: destroy) my theory.  Hehe, but it's okay, seeing as I have such a  huge  audience.  |Unleaded|

      My back hurts.  Haha, and if you got this far, congrats. If you were me, you'd be thinking this was another teenage angst blog("OOOH EVERYONE HATES ME!!!111 Im sO UNLOVED!! PLEASSE HELP. If I get no comments I'll commit suicide, ro go do drugs!!1"). The good news is that, you'd be wrong.  Har, so there.  -Toe-ing the line, one step at a time.
