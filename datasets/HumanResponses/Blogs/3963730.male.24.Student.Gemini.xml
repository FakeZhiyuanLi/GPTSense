      How is it, that when someone you don't care about shows you no love, you can simply dislike or hate them for it.  But when it is someone you love who hurts you by showing no love, you cannot dislike them - because you love them - it would be ridiculous!&nbsp; You cannot help feeling some bad feelings towards them for hurting you, but&nbsp;you can't stand to feel that way&nbsp;because these feelings damage your own&nbsp;love for them.  So you ignore the feelings (to protect your love), allowing yourself to be hurt without protecting yourself.&nbsp; And without even allowing the possibility to leave if the hurt is to great.&nbsp; You make yourself a victim, and worst of all this only makes them love you less, as you become even less the person you were&nbsp;who they once&nbsp;loved.&nbsp; So they love you less and hurt you more.  There is eventually a point when you are hurt to much for love to remain.&nbsp; Your own love for them is damaged or broken, and you can't help feeling bad at them more for breaking your love as well as&nbsp;their's.  Love works fine when you both are in love.&nbsp; But as soon as one decides not, then the other could love them to heaven and it would still be futile, because they can eventually bring even the highest love down by the hurt that results from their decision.  I agree, it is impossible to stay together unless both want it.&nbsp; But at least there are the memories of your time together.&nbsp; At least that is what I had imagined, but it seems that breakups don't only&nbsp;apply to now and the future, but also the past.&nbsp; How is it possible to breakup and keep memories?&nbsp; If we cannot feel those things now, how can we remember how they felt?&nbsp; It is as&nbsp;if they never existed, and that the love was erased even from those days that have already been.  A worse thought still is that, if it was truly love, then how could it simply disappear with no warning?&nbsp; Surely breaking up is a proof that it could not have been love at the start.&nbsp; But that is not a nice thought.. in that case, what was that time together.&nbsp; How terrible to believe it is love when it is not.&nbsp; Who was fooling who, was it all an act.  And the only way to move on is to not even think about the above, because to do so even a passing moment is so confusing, the complete lack of sense and reason makes me feel sick, and my head ache.&nbsp; It seems like the impossible question, with no answer, and yet also many all conflicting answers.  There is no certainty or security of knowing, that at least I can understand one thing or another.&nbsp; Because I just can't understand even one thing, and can't even begin to think without it hurting.  (a little too personal I know, and maybe I will have to remove it later, I have to admit being ashamed to write it.&nbsp; But I hope it at least gets some of you thinking, and recieves some responses of various views of love, breakups, life, etc.)  dave

       I have to admit I am getting fed up of the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent every night this week to finish this blog (after only creating it last weekend) and to organise my email accounts more equally.&nbsp; And I have spent most of my free time since the exams (nearly 2 months ago) trying to finish my website.    &nbsp;  The website is mostly done, and yet still a long way from being ready for release.&nbsp; At least I have managed to finish something at last with this blog.    &nbsp;  I think I will have a break for a week, I haven't seen any friends in the chat for a couple of weeks now since I began these long days at Asda.&nbsp; I am just quickly on now to email&nbsp;Odile's sister&nbsp;Sophie a happy birthday for today.    &nbsp;  I am listening to  Roy Orbison - Mystery girl , which I haven't for a while since Odile.&nbsp; Funnily it doesn't make me feel as sad anymore.&nbsp; Just almost emotionless, I am not sure which is worse.

       I hadn't heard from Odile for a while, and we haven't really spoken properly&nbsp;since January or February.     &nbsp;   I left a voice message on Odile's french mobile on Thursday, to tell her my uni results.&nbsp; I feel like it&nbsp;was somehow a joint effort, since I am sure that it was  being with her &nbsp;that  made the difference for my improvement at uni last year .&nbsp; Although this year&nbsp;was my&nbsp;achievement, but it was definitely&nbsp;rooted a lot in&nbsp;my year with Odile.&nbsp;  This year I have to thank my classmates  for the joint effort, I loved every moment of this&nbsp;uni year - more than any other (at uni), and&nbsp; to feel so many people as friends motivated&nbsp;me hugely at uni, and in life .     &nbsp;   Today I recieved two&nbsp;textos from her, just moments after I had been thinking about her and&nbsp;imagining that&nbsp;I was unlikely to get a reply.&nbsp; She didn't mention my results, so I guess she hadn't heard that message yet, and was replying to a texto I sent a week earlier about getting in touch by SMS.&nbsp; But she gave me her swiss mobile number, so I hope we can speak often by texto now.     &nbsp;    I am so happy to hear from her , and can't wait to speak with her (tomorrow I hope).&nbsp; I have really missed her, and would love us to not be so distant anymore.     &nbsp;   Today was definitely an enjoyable day for me&nbsp; :)

       French DVDs (Amazon.fr)  ( part&nbsp;1  of 2)     &nbsp;   Last night I had been watching dvds of some French children's series', which were waiting for me from amazon.fr, when I arrived home.&nbsp; I am really pleased,&nbsp;I love them.&nbsp; They are " the mysterious cities of gold ", and " once upon a time.. the life ".     &nbsp;   Both&nbsp;were on TV in england when I was a child, some time around 1990.     ("cities of gold" played twice on BBC, and "once upon a time.. the life", played only once that I saw, on channel 4) .&nbsp;  I had been waiting ever since, for cities of gold to be played on TV again but it never was, but since 2001 these dvds have been released (only in France) .     &nbsp;   I don't remember the ending that these dvds have for cities of gold, so I am not sure that they played all the episodes on TV over here.     &nbsp;  I admit I was slow to&nbsp;change from&nbsp;vhs to&nbsp;dvds,&nbsp;these&nbsp;are the first ones I have bought and I am&nbsp;proud of them (did you already guess?)  those memories mean a lot to me .   My mum thinks I am becoming a kid again!&nbsp; I agree and I don't see anything wrong with it.&nbsp; I loved them as a kid, and I am so pleased to feel that again.&nbsp; I thought this could be a good moment to mention to her that I saw dvds of two other series of my childhood: the old 80s series' of Dungeons and dragons, and He-man: masters of the universe.&nbsp; So look out for a writeup on them when I get them next time!&nbsp;     Lets make  a&nbsp;toast to being a kid again!  Cheers.   &nbsp;  dave    &nbsp;  P.S. the one series I&nbsp;most want to find next is  Ulysses , (set in space) remember that!&nbsp;Who loves it?

       Hi everyone, I had my uni. results in the post&nbsp;today :)     (I would love to know your results? Tell me by adding a comment here, or by e-mailing me)      &nbsp;   I have a  2:2 , so I am really pleased.&nbsp; (I&nbsp;had found&nbsp;my mark a few weeks ago on the internet, so I already knew.&nbsp; But I wanted to wait for the full details to come in the post, in case the mark was wrong.).     &nbsp;   For those of you who didn't already know, I have&nbsp;studied  economics and politics , at the University of the West&nbsp;of England (and the last year was the best one, I loved everyone!)     &nbsp;   Of course my parents are really happy (or relieved) too, after 6 years of uni&nbsp;- they had thought that because I didn't tell them sooner&nbsp;I had a 3rd, or a fail.     &nbsp;   (Well that will&nbsp;give me peace and freedom, and&nbsp;get them off my back for a week!&nbsp; But after a week&nbsp;they&nbsp;will be back to normal - I know&nbsp;how things work around here!)&nbsp;;)     &nbsp;   I still don't plan on deciding anything until september, for what I will do next.&nbsp; At the moment I am still in my student job at Asda (at cribbs causeway for those of you from Bristol), although I am now doing about 32 hours a week, with Wednesdays and Sundays off.&nbsp; I am enjoying it and there are a lot of people I like there (I have been there a year and&nbsp;a half), so I will stay until September.&nbsp; Even though my situation is ridiculous as you will read in the next few sentences.     &nbsp;   I had to leave my student house in Bristol on 27th June, but it was all a bit sudden - we had all forgotten the contract finished so soon, and expected to have until the 31st of June.&nbsp; So I had to move out without any new house to move into, I spent 2 weeks trying to find houses without any luck.&nbsp; It was a lot of hassle 1. the majority are not available until mid-August and September, and 2. they all want at least 6 months contract, and most want 10 months or 1 year (I only found 2&nbsp;who want&nbsp;3 months).&nbsp; And my problem was that I don't really want to sign a contract, since I haven't made any plans and don't know if I could afford to stay in Bristol&nbsp;6 months, or if I even want to stay for 6 months!     &nbsp;   Anyway after two weeks of travelling to Bristol for the day before each workday, and sleeping or not sleeping&nbsp;(unofficially and uncomfortably) in the 24 hour computer room overnight (all my shifts were early mornings&nbsp;- too early to travel).&nbsp; I eventually managed to change my hours of work to the middle of the day, so that I can travel in the mornings and back in the evenings by bus each day.&nbsp; ...Here's the ridiculous part - I spend 7 hours working each day,&nbsp;and 8 hours travelling! (I leave my house in&nbsp;Somerset at 7.30am, and return at 10.30pm - obviously not ideal, but I like the work and it is easy, nice people, and alright money.&nbsp; I am looking into travelling by train, but it may not be much quicker).     &nbsp;    P.S.  Went out for a meal tonight with my parents, sister, and aunty Ruby (she's 90)&nbsp;from Newport, at the hungry horse, to celebrate my results.&nbsp; It was really nice.     &nbsp;    P.P.S.  I had my first red bull today, since the morning of our last exam (3rd June)- it is a landmark day!     &nbsp;   See you all soon I hope, keep in touch&nbsp;whatever way&nbsp;you like.     &nbsp;   dave

      Its been a while but I am back, thanks to those of you who have kept visiting, even though I haven't been updating the blog for a couple of weeks.  I have to admit I am feeling a new regard to reality after just hearing about the situation of a friend and her family. Only a few things are truly important in life, and they are the least easy to attain, and to understand. There is little certainty, but these are the things that really matter.  Well I have been on my holidays, after stopping my daily travels to my job in Bristol (15 hour days are too much). It seems like I have been busy, but as usual no surprise - I havent managed to get much done. I receieved some more dvds - Cruel intentions (one of my favourites, and also for some of you too I remember ;), 1492 - conquest of paradise (Columbus discovers paradise, then sees it ruined, very good), and a bbc series with Sam Neil (Space, basically a series on space with really good graphics and music - for kids allegedly but I had to really concentrate to take some of it in).  My computer isnt good enough to use skype (for calling computer to computer, or computer to landline phones), but I am going to try it this week on my sister's &amp; her boyfriend's computer. If it works I can prepay (like with a mobile) and should be able to call internationally with it for 2 cents (euro cents) per minute - brilliant! It will save me a lot compared to the last 2 weeks.
