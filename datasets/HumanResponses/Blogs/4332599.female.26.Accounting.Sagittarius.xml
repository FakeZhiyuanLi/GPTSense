      Hmm, now that I have did all the necessary things to set up this blog, I am at a loss for words. Well let's see, I could use this as a vent for the crappy weather that has befallen me in the MIDDLE of SUMMER??? Go figure the weather has gone to hell. One moment its a scorching 30 degrees and now its a friggin 7 degrees. Gee will we ever have a proper summer? Looks like our plans for a final camping trip might get bumped to NEXT YEAR!!! Arrrgghhhhh!!! This is just peachy!  Ok enough with the weather. Next bitch on the agenda, oops, I meant to say next point on my rantings and ravings.  I need to start to drive the speed limit on the highways. Oh my god its hard! Some people drive like its Sunday 7 days a week. Like hello I would like to get home this year, I have a life outside of driving on the roads. Seriously, I think my first New Year's Resolution for 2005 is not going to be to lose the blubber. That just got bumped to resolution numero 2. My FIRST and NUMBER ONE resolution is to STOP SPEEDING!! I swear the coppers will probably catch the quota every month if they were to just sit on the corner of my exit ramp to home. AND I would be so broke after forking out the dough.  Man this sucky weather is totally playing on my mood, all I wanna do is go back to bed. Its a bloody miracle that I managed to drag myself to swimming last night. Boy was that hard. Boy am I lazy. Boy I need a life.  Ok ok, its 2:30pm Tuesday arvo, I'm at work and BORED outta my mind!  I've done all my tasks for the day, surfed as much of the net as I can. But my day isn't over at the regular 4:00pm scram out the door.  Started a new side gig - to support my spending habits!! (oh and eating habits!) My other job beckons! Hoping it will pay for my super duper spending spree back in Sing Sing when the hubby (Tom) and I come down to PIG OUT!!!  Gee you would think with the population of Asians in Calgary there would be a decent Asian food restaurant! Which is pretty reasonable? NOT! Well I cannot seriously complain, there is one in good ole High River. But its only got its "select" menu items.  Some days I hallucinate that I can smell, rojak, nasi bryani, nasi lemak, chicken rice... oh my goodness.... ok I am totally making myself suffer.  Hmm, I wonder if I could courier half the hawker stalls in Sing Sing to my back yard?  Tomorrow will be a better day at work. I cannot wait. I get to bring my puppy to work. Yipee!! Plus I get to go shopping after work. Thank god! But its not just retail therapy, it has its purpose.  Going back to Sing Sing, Tom and I are going to renew our vows for my family to be present and be a part of our marriage. Yea yea, I know. So I get to find a dress for the day. NO ! NOT a huge fru-fru frilly frolly wedding dress. More like a formal dress so that I can wear it again. Sorry I do not see the purpose of buying a dress at such an insane cost only to wear it once, Paris Hilton I am not. Even if I had the dough. How insane.  I cannot wait for September long weekend!! I so need a break. Have not had proper holidays since September last year, come to think of it. Oh man its been forever.  Ahh... the sweet sounds of the radio - the ole retro station in Calgary, Jack FM - Annie Lennox ( Who's That Girl).  Tuesday night telly - Big Brother 5, The Amazing Race 5. Yea reality show junkie I am. But I might try swimming tonight. Gotta lose the blubber before Sing Sing.  What is with people who live in "westernized" countries that put on the pounds. Hmm, could it be that the servings are HUGE? Well as Tom puts it, a super sized Maccas meal in Sing Sing is equivilent to a regular sized Maccas meal here. Gee might that be the explanantion?  Or might it be that I live with a person who has 4 stomachs like a cow? Tom grazes morning, noon and night. He eats every 2 hours. Plus he eats alot. Grocery shopping - groceries do not last a day. A flat of pop ( 24 cans ) lasts maybe 3 days tops. Could that be my explanantion for my unnatural weight gain. Hahahahahaha. Yea oh well, so much more to love of me? Seriously, I'm exercising to get fit, if I lose a couple of dress sizes, well and good, but I do want to stop hyperventilating when I run.  Alrity then. I think I might be running out of things to say. Ha! Thats too funny. Me run out of things to say. More like I am so brain dead from the lack of brain function all day I just cannot think or continue to form proper sentences, things are starting to come out like gibberish.......  Til Next Time!!
