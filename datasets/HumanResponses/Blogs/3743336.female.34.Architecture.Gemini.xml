      I have been reading other peoples online journals for a while and I am so inspired by the way people are able to express their thoughts so freely and often. Some writers are so talented and prolific and post multiple times per day, always checking in with amusing tales of their current life or rememberances from the past. I, on the other hand, found it extremely difficult to put together the "simple" five paragraph essays that were required to pass college english 101. I took the course three times over my long and varied college career but never completed it. It was the darn essay that got me everytime. Welcome to my journey. I have tried to make this a comfortable place for myself so I can be inspired to be creative. The good news is...no five paragraph essays allowed!

      Alright...so much for inspiring writing! I have neglected this writing assignment I had given myself. If I am going to journal...I have to write it down!  Did I ever mention that I am a geek? I mean if you were to look at me, I wouldn't necessarily fall into what a geek looks like category but inside my own head...all geek. I like information, history, stories, pop culture, obscure references to movies. I quote movie lines. I make strange old television show story line references in my everyday life that no one ever gets... I vote! I remember turning 18 and being so excited that the first time in my life I could vote, it would be for President! Of course I voted for the guy that lost, but I voted! See...geek... My best girlfriend Michelle (also turning 18) had no idea why I was so excited...you see she didn't register and I don't think she ever has voted. I told her recently to register and I would tell her who to vote for because she apparently didn't care so I might as well get a second vote in because I feel like I care enough for at least 2 people...hopefully my guy will win this time!
