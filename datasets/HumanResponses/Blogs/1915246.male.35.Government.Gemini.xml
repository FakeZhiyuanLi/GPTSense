      Went to see  urlLink Lost in Translation  on Saturday night.  Bill Murray was great, I think he's consistently funny in all his films.  Here's the synopsis (taken from the film website):   Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two Americans in Tokyo. Bob is a movie star in town to shoot a whiskey commercial, while Charlotte is a young woman tagging along with her workaholic photographer husband (Giovanni Ribisi). Unable to sleep, Bob and Charlotte cross paths one night in the luxury hotel bar. This chance meeting soon becomes a surprising friendship. Charlotte and Bob venture through Tokyo, having often hilarious encounters with its citizens, and ultimately discover a new belief in life's possibilities.   The two characters don't have an affair, but they do connect on some level.  I won't spoil the ending, but it does leave you wondering...

      I got off work early today (3:30), so of course the traffic on the 5 Frwy was backed up due to a overturned tanker truck near El Toro Rd.  So....I get off on Bake Pkwy to "sneak" around the traffic on Irvine Ctr Dr. but I turned the wrong way because I was in the wrong lane.  So after making a U-turn and finally getting to Irvine Ctr. Dr. it appears that EVERYBODY had the same idea and there's a ton of traffic on Moulton Pkwy.   I go all the way to El Toro Rd and make a RIGHT so I can go back to the 133/73 and get on the 73 South.  After much traffic and delays I make it home in one hour.  What a waste of getting off early!

      Two years ago on this day, I woke up, took a shower, went downstairs and flipped on the TV before I left for work.

I wasn't very hungry so I only ordered toast - It didn't feel right to be eating breakfast there that day.

      This page on the  urlLink WPL Format  is this only thing I could find on how the auto playlists are generated.  Most of the auto playlists included with Windows Media Player 9...well...they suck.  Why include an auto playlist "Music I dislike"?  I'm not sure who would take the time to rate music bad and then use a playlist to listen to it.  Maybe I don't see the point.   Here is some modified code that will find tracks that are "not so fresh"....  &lt;?wpl version="1.0"?&gt; &lt;smil&gt;     &lt;head&gt;         &lt;meta name="Generator" content="Microsoft Windows Media Player -- 9.0.0.2773"/&gt;         &lt;title&gt;Not So Fresh tracks&lt;/title&gt;     &lt;/head&gt;     &lt;body&gt;         &lt;seq&gt;             &lt;smartPlaylist version="1.0.0.0"&gt;                 &lt;querySet&gt;                     &lt;sourceFilter id="{4202947A-A563-4B05-A754-A1B4B5989849}" name="Music from my Media Library"&gt;                         &lt;fragment name="Acquisition Date"&gt;                             &lt;argument name="condition"&gt;Is Before&lt;/argument&gt;                             &lt;argument name="value"&gt;Today&lt;/argument&gt;                         &lt;/fragment&gt;                     &lt;/sourceFilter&gt;                 &lt;/querySet&gt;             &lt;/smartPlaylist&gt;         &lt;/seq&gt;     &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/smil&gt;

       New development....   The secret police of the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) waved their large-caliber automatic pistols menacingly as they raided the popular restaurant, Baja Fresh, arresting key employees and startling the lunch crowd today.  Several restaurant managers and all of the cooks were searched, handcuffed and led out of the Main Place mall.  Their heads hung down in red-faced shame as they were deprived of order pads, spatulas, and tall white chef's hats.   The arrested avoided all direct eye contact as they filed out of the restaurant into waiting window-barricaded police buses.   Shirley Ptomaine, a spokesperson for the secret police unit of the FDA told reporters that Baja Fresh had been under investigation for several months after receiving a tip from a disgruntled Baja Fresh line cook that "all was not well" in the kitchen of that establishment.  And, recipe books, confiscated from the Baja Fresh kitchen by the FDA as evidence, seem to prove that things there were much worse than first believed.   "Just look here," said Mrs. Ptomaine, pointing to a recipe for a very popular menu selection, the large burrito. "For added meat zest, unwrap a sealed bundle of 30 day-old aged, unwashed clothing from the R. Benson Spice and Flavoring Corp.  Add clothing to a pot of boiling meat starting first with dirty socks, jockey briefs, and t-shirts.  Then, add the pants, jacket, baseball cap, and tennis shoes.  Bring to boil, then turn down heat and simmer over night.  This flavorful pot of stewed meat will be ready to add to burritos by lunchtime the next day.  Be sure and replace this secret recipe book back in the office vault to keep it from the prying, diligent eyes of public health inspectors! "   News of this secret recipe spread through the lunchtime customers at Baja Fresh faster than a raging Colorado forest fire.  Upon hearing details, nearly all patrons turned green and began projectile vomiting.  Several customers fainted and had to be taken away in ambulances.  One customer however, apparently a Santa Ana employee, was oblivious to the news and continued to gorge with relish on his large burrito as he gabbed away the time with fellow employees.  He apparently was looking forward to spending time in a local bookstore staring lustfully at the glossy pages of magazines, aptly named: Men's Lard, Lady's Flab, Babes of Blubber, Big Fat Men, Large Flabby Asses, and other publications of the same genre.  He was last seen wiping his mouth with a Baja Fresh paper napkin and littering the floor with it when he was through.   The judge who will be first hearing these charges is not expected to allow bail.  Baja Fresh employees collectively face 4,831 years in prison.   Associated Press

      Do you ever think your kids are faking being sick to get out of going to school, so you send them to school and it turns out they really are sick?  When it happens, you feel real bad.  :-(  I was in the shower this morning and Stone told me his throat hurt, but I didn't believe him.  I told him..."Go tell Mommy...".  He didn't want breakfast this morning either.  Then Shireen took him on his field trip to the pumpkin farm but he just wanted to go home and rest.  Turns out he has a fever of 102....

      Watched a bunch of movies this past weekend due to my partial immobility.   urlLink Bulletproof Monk  - The story concept was great but the character development was a little shaky.  I think they had trouble "wrapping up" the story at the end.  The special features on the DVD had an alternate ending that would have made more sense with all the computerized torture devices the evil nazi guy had built.  They didn't really explain those in the released version of the movie.   urlLink Blood Work   - Clint Eastwood directed and starred in this movie.  It was good, but not as good as the book.  Clint plays a retired FBI profiler who gets a heart transplant from the victim of a serial killer that is connected to his character.  Anyway, you should really read the book.   urlLink Daredevil  - Ben Affleck is not the typical guy you imagine playing a superhero.  The movie had some pretty good effects, but that's about it.  I would see it if you are a real Marvel Comics fan, but if you're not you can skip it.

      Got the "snip, snip" the other day.  The actual procedure was virtually painless.  There was an odd pressure during one part, which almost felt like a internal tug or a squeeze but nothing that really hurt.  Now it feels like a dull ache,  like someone kneed you in the groin...repeatedly.

      I'm having problems with the digitizer on my Palm Tungsten T.  It loses the registration after a while...it drifts down or to the right about 5-10 pixels.  That doesn't sound like much, but when you are trying to hit one of the on screen buttons it really makes it difficult.  It's still under warranty for another month, so I could try to get it fixed, but get this.  You have to call Palm to get the warranty return authoization AND it costs 25 bucks to call them.  They say that if the unit can be fixed or you aren't satisfied with the proposed fix, they don't charge for the call, but it sound like just enough of a hassle to prevent people from calling.  What a load.

      Wer're leaving for Las Vegas for Thanksgiving tomorrow morning.  We'll start out around 7:30 a.m. so we can get to Barstow around 9:30.  That way we can get the kids out of the car for a bit before we tackle the second half of the drive.  We're staying at Paris which is pretty decent, but for some reason I've never had good luck in the casino there.  Thanksgiving Dinner will be at the Bellagio buffet.  Then it's back home again on Friday so we can skip the traffic.

      Ok...   The Coffee Club is looking kinda sad right now.  Not many people actually bring in coffee anymore which makes the people that do bring in coffee feel lonely and dejected.   So, in order to re-energize the coffee club let's have everyone bring in some new coffee (Mary is excluded because she just bought a bunch).  If you want out of the club, just let me know.     Everyone knows that I pretty much only drink decaf or 50/50 but we don't have to brew decaf all the time, I can always use the coffee maker in my office.    What kind of Coffee to buy?   If it comes in a can from the grocery store, keep walking.  That coffee is crappy and we all know it.&nbsp;     Pretty much any coffee from Trader Joes is acceptable.&nbsp;     Costco sells pretty good coffee, but it would have to be Jose's or the Starbucks roasted one.&nbsp;     Flavored coffee is ok. (except amaretto, which takes like monkey sweat)&nbsp;     We don't need filters right now.     Rules of Coffee Club    You do not talk about 'Coffee Club'.    You do not talk about 'Coffee Club'.    When someone yells "Stop" or goes limp, taps out, or has an empty cup of coffee the fight is over.    Only two cups of coffee to a fight.    One coffee pot at a time.    No shirts, no shoes, no coffee.    Fights go on as long as they have to or until you are out of coffee.    If this is your first night at 'Coffee Club', you have to buy coffee.

      Whoops! I forgot to post the latest update from the Rich Benson Archives yesterday!  Oh well, here you go...  Dear Trevor,  There is no reason to worry about my large rectal tumor.  It is healthy and growing at a good clip and always leaves me with that "full" feeling, like I'm ready to "push one", but of course, I can't because it's just a big tumor and not a stool.  I did not fall off of the edge of the planet though I did walk up to it and look over the ledge.  It's a long way down, so I spit.  In 408,000 light years my glop of saliva will collide with some planet.  The accumulated force on the spit from the time and speed of the drop will most likely kill millions of inhabitants there.  Maybe through some strange curvature of warped time that already happened and was the cause for the dinosaur extinction.  What do you think?  Zanzibar - you can't get there from here, so it doesn't matter where it is. Quit worrying about it.  How fast does a cheetah run?  A cheater runs very fast if he's been caught and doesn't want to be punished.  Dolomite is very dangerous.  It has a fuse and when lit it is used to demolish old bridges and buildings.  It is also used in mining.  It's a major in dog food, too.  Arron Burr was the world's most notorious miss-speller.  His name, correctly spelled, is Errol Bird.  I think he had something to do with an assassin.  Neither of the trains leaving Chicago, the 64mph train and the 80mph train will arrive in Kentucky first.  Here's why:  the 64mph train is heading for California and is being transported there via tractor trailer trucks on US highways which will not pass through Kentucky.  The 80mph train, however,  IS a direct express train to Kentucky and will not make it because the first bridge it must cross, in Illinois, was inadvertently blown up with several sticks of Dolomite.  All of the passengers on the train will die, except for the survivors.  The survivors will be accidently buried in a mass grave causing the first part of the last sentence to become true.  The sky is blue because during the 1930's, at the height of the depression, Roosevelt put the nation, which was unemployed at the time, to work and painted that color.  The sky's natural color is shit brown and studded with occaisional corn-colored stars and planets.  Last month I traded securities like a mad-man.  I went very easy (trading stocks) for the first two years to make sure I knew what I was doing.  I made $19,700 in the first 18 trading days of January.  Then, on the second trading day of this month, I lost about 9 grand in a dopey trade.  I shorted CREE, which ran up $50 in two days.  I had 400 shares of it short and got pinched for $20. Then I did something else dumb and lost another 2 grand.  If I'd have just went long and not traded anything in my three favorite stocks, RFMD, CREE, and SNDK for the month of January, I'd have made nearly $50,000.  I'm going to gamble some and try to make a lot of money this year.  However, right now I'm not trading anything actively and could meet you for lunch tomorrow if you want too.  I've got a hankering for a chicken bowl!

      It's the coveted Broccoli Thanksgiving Casserole recipe!  This is a  great  recipe that reminds me of the holidays.  There is a lot of prep work involved with sauteing the onions and grating the carrots and cooking the broccoli.  You end up using a lot of bowls before you're done, but it's worth it!   Broccoli Thanksgiving Casserole  1 pkg. (or more) Stove Top stuffing (The canister is bigger than the box, so you can't go wrong buying more than you need.) 1 cube butter melted  Mix the above ingredients together with Stove Top seasoning packet and set them aside.  3 pkgs. frozen chopped broccoli ( cooked and drained ) (Get the 10oz square boxes of broccoli) 1/2 to 1 small onion, minced and sauted until lightly browned 1 can cream of mushroom soup 8 oz. sour cream (or a little more) 1 carrot grated (big carrot)  Mix the above ingredients well in a large bowl.  Layer 1/2 of stuffing on bottom of 9x13 pan Pour broccoli mixture over stuffing. Top with other half of stuffing.  Bake at 350&deg; for 25 - 30 min.  Cover with grated sharp cheddar cheese (enough to cover the top) Cover with foil until cheese melts.  If needed, put back in oven briefly to melt cheese.

      How to generate large-format Postscript files for distilling with Adobe Acrobat ver 5.0  I have found that for some reason, you can't use the Adobe Acrobat Distiller printer driver to print large-format files from within the GeoMedia Professional layout window.    To solve this problem I developed the following workflow. I've tested this workflow on both Windows NT 4.0 6a & Windows 2000 Professional, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on Windows XP.  1. Download a Postscript plotter driver from the HP website (we have used both the HP 5000 PS3 60" and the HP 5500 PS 60" with mostly the same results).  I suppose a driver that creates more "vanilla" Postscript would work better, but I haven't found a good driver that will print on sizes as large as the HP plotter drivers.  2. Using the Control Panel -> Printers -> Add New Printer command, create a new printer using the HP DesignJet 5000PS3 plotter driver files you just downloaded and assign the port to FILE.  3.  From the GeoMedia Layout window, print to the HP 5000 PS3.  You will need to select a paper size using one of the DEFAULT paper sizes (do NOT use a custom postscript paper size, it doesn't work for our application).  If you like, you can create additional paper sizes for your printer by using the "Server Properties" selection from the File menu of the Control Panel -> Printers menu.  4. If you are using any True Type fonts in the layout window, then you need to use the "download true type as soft fonts" option from the advanced options tab of the plotter.  Even if you aren't using True Type fonts, it shouldn't hurt to choose this option.  5.  Don't change any other options and choose "ok" or "print". You do NOT have to check the "print to file" check box.  6.  You are prompted to select a path and filename. (Example -  d:\test.ps)  7. Open Adobe Acrobat Distiller -> Settings -> Job Options and create a new "Job Options" setting by changing the default paper size. Make sure the distiller paper size matches or is LARGER than the paper size you selected in the GeoMedia layout window. Save the job option with a new name for the paper size you are printing to: 24"x 36" or 42" x 42" for example.  8.  In Distiller, select this new job option setting you just created and open the Postscript file to you created earlier.  Distiller should process this .ps file without errors.  9.  In Adobe Acrobat, you can crop and/or rotate the resulting PDF file to the right size and orientation.  We have used this printing method for a while and it seems to work for us.  I'd be interested in hearing from others if they are doing something similar or if they have a different method.

      Tell me about "Stewy Rice" = New Customer!  Yes, it's the truth.  Every single inquiry about delicious "Stewy Rice" has led to a new customer, one who is delightfully satisfied by the fragrant stewy odors and delicious lip-smacking tastes of meaty stew over rice.  For starters, it is--of course you've already realized this--absolutely impossible to compare Chili Rice to Stewy Rice.  It is like trying to compare infinite love to eternal bliss, a daunting task that cannot be accomplished and should not even be attempted.  What we can say is that in making "Stewy Rice" we bathe the process in loving care so that you may experience pure gustatory bliss in your dining experience.  We are swamped with requests that ask, "What's in the stew," and we realize that this is an undisguised--and often unrecognized by the consumer--attempt to weasel out our secret recipe from our Chefs.  Yes, Chefs!  "Stewy Rice" is special to us, so we don't employ common cooks to prepare your food, we utilize the remarkable talents of famous Chefs hired--at enormous expense, mind you--from around the globe.  As you can imagine, we pack in the goodness.  We pour in the unique flavors.  We select only the finest animals from which to carve large, choice cuts of meat.  The perfect vegetables used in "Stewy Rice” are actually grown in real gardens in real, mineral rich soil.  The thick, deliciously delightful gravy is a secret concoction of balanced spices, known only to our Chef de Food, who is directed by, and works directly under our world famous Chef de Bean. Lots of what you want as well as lots of everything else goes into "Stewy Rice," you can count on that!  How much Stew?  Too much, it seems, but actually not enough!  As strange as that last statement seems, it's true.  Let me explain.  When you're through eating a heaping plateful of Stewy Rice (if you can finish it!), you are so satisfied that you feel you couldn't possibly eat another bite.  But a short time later, with the delicious flavors of Stewy Rice still lingering in your mouth, you feel as if you haven't had enough Stewy Rice!  This is a puzzle which confounds even our world famous Chefs, but which keeps Stewy Rice converts coming back time after time for more and more.  Because of the deliciousness of Stewy Rice, it's careful preparation takes plenty of time and only the finest ingredients are used.  Since this is the case, we are forced to prepare only small batches of Stewy Rice for consumption.  This means we run out of the wholesome Stewy Rice very early each and every day as demanding customers continually swamp our little restaurant.  Normally, I would advise coming early to insure you receive a desirable, delicious, heaping plate of Stewy Rice, but actually I'm going to plead with you to stay away.  Don't fight the crowds to experience Stewy Rice.  Don't drive in here before everyone else and guarantee yourself a plateful of magnificent Stewy Rice.  Don't even bring enough money for a second helping of Stewy Rice, even though you'll want it.  Don't daydream about all of the exotic, delicious flavors of Stewy Rice that will drive you crazy until your palate is satisfied.  Why keep Stewy Rice on your mind when you're at work?  Why dwell on the delicious experience of Stewy Rice and torment yourself?  Just put the joyous satisfaction of enjoying a wonderful plateful of good Stewy Rice right out of your mind.  Don't dwell on the delicious flavors and don't think about the tasty ingredients.  This way you won't rush here as soon as possible to buy as much Stewy Rice as you can comfortably enjoy.  Thanks for inquiring about Chef de Bean's world renowned Stewy Rice!   Chef de Bean  Inventor of Stewy Rice

      Don't Fall Into The Trap!  Parents, don't fall into the trap of selecting what you think to be popular names for your children only to find that those names have fallen from popularity!  The way to avoid that is to constantly "stay on top of things" by frequently checking "Richie's Popular Baby Names" list.  Richie culls tens of thousands of names worldwide and determines which names are gaining or losing in popularity.  Without knowing what's going on or what's coming off of the list, you could stigmatize your child with the wrong name during your child's formative years.  Why raise a child to become disturbed or afflicted with emotional problems as an adolescent or adult because their name was not well chosen?  Well, by checking Richie's list, you no longer have to worry about that!  For example, most recently the boy's name "Stone" has waned so much in popularity it was removed from the list.  Replacement names, which have gained in popularity, have been added to the list.  Replacement names for Stone are: Brick, Gravel, Flint, Rock, Boulder, and Marble.  For a small fee of $350.00 you can have Richie professionally change your child's name in a court of law so that he will grow up strong, well balanced, and liked (as opposed to shunned) by family, friends, and strangers.  And, as another example, the girl's name of "Layla" has fallen far from favor, and it, too, was removed from Richie's list of Popular Baby Names. The replacement names, which are gaining fast with strong popularity include: Lulu, Lylee, Lunglung, Lorblu, Lharglhork, Lufffleeff, and Loonloon.  The tiny $350.00 name change fee applies here, too, if you want your daughter to grow up normally, marry, and have living offspring. Who wouldn't pay this ridiculously low amount to guarantee the joy of grandchildren for you to enjoy in those upcoming, golden, retirement years?  Name change applications are available at Richie's Fun Park after park admission has been paid.  Just ask for your free application after you've ordered a Cattle Rancher BBQ Plate Special from Cookie's BBQ Chuck wagon stand.  Cookie's BBQ Plate specials start at an affordable $37.25 per person.  The Cattle Rancher BBQ Plate Special is just $59.95, but if you mention this article, Cookie will sell you the same plate for only $63.00!

      Chirstmas was great this year.  Everyone had a good time at our house even though Layla was feeling under the weather.  :-(  Brooks was especially unlucky when his train home didn't arrive on time due to a crash on the tracks - the rain was coming down pretty fierce so he decided to take a cab home to the tune of $100 and he didn't get home until 12 midnight or so.  I wish he had just come back here so I could have driven him home, but he didn't.  I felt bad for not waiting for him when I dropped him off so I will reimburse him for the cab fare.  I got a new cell phone which is cool and a bunch of games for the computer:  Jedi Academy, XIII, Max Payne, Star Trek Elite Force II and Spiderman for the PS2.  Nice.  Shireen got a new laptop to use at law school - but I'm sure she will let me use it too!  ;-)  Back to work tomorrow kiddies....

      Trevor,  I'm sending the "Season's Greetings!" letter ahead of a small gift I've purchased for you.  The small shoulder-sitting parrot will follow in time for your holiday shopping excursions.  This is a small South American Mall parrot and is most comfortable standing on your shoulder in a mall during holiday shopping excursions.  Her name is Lupe and I only had time to teach her two lines, which she's been trained to repeat frequently: "Richard L. Benson!" and "Don't forget Richard L. Benson!" You can teach her other lines; it only takes a couple of months of simple repetition.  By the way, you will be envied by all other shoppers because wearing trained parrots in malls is the newest "in thing" this year!  Yes, people will be pointing at you with jealous envy pumping through their hearts!  So, this trend is so new I don't want you to be surprised if you only see a very few others wearing their fashionable parrots as they shop, okay?  Lupe the parrot already has a crush on you.  That's because I placed a small photograph of you her in your cage with a small sign above it that read "new owner."  Within days she became infatuated with your handsome image and began training just that much harder!  She was in a big hurry to sit on your shoulders and impress you with her new vocabulary!  Of course, I don't expect gifts this year for myself, but since I'm hard to shop for and because people occasionally do purchase me something, I thought one of these "new-fangled" wish lists would be helpful.  I only saw "new-fangled" because of the way this "new" wish list works.  Each time you read an item off of the list, you have to pause and visualize it.  Then you have to silently repeat it to yourself.  Then you have to say it out loud, slowly, five times.  Then you have to visualize again, but this time see it being used or in operation.  Then you have to call someone in the office and interrogate them about the item on the list. This involves the five "w's": Who, What, When, Where, Why?  You ask them "Who do you know who owns one?  What does it do?  When are they used? Where does one buy one?  Why should I buy one today?  Do this with each item on the list, and do it each day for the next ten working days.  The more you do this, the more satisfaction you derive from the effort! It's incremental, and on the 10th day, the positive feelings about oneself is said to be astonishing!  So, give it a try this year!  The stuff I'll be looking for in my stocking on the mantle is:  DNA Analyzer and Species Replicator General Electric Personal Jet Pack Night Vision Goggles Magnetic Moon Boots Flux Fibulating Thrust Reverser Fort Knox Depository Box of Suppositories Magic Tome The Complete Book of Witchcraft and Evil Spells A Ray Gun (battery operated) A pet Tyrannosaurus Rex A Magic Wand Thumbscrews An Electric Chair Silencers Hand Grenades A Nuclear Submarine complete with Hydrogen Bombs A fuzzy rabbit A lock of hair from Adolf Hitler A few moustache hairs from Josef Stalin Skeleton Keys for the California Prison System Skeleton Keys for the Federal Prison System Lunchmeat A Makeover Men's BVD Briefs with Playtex Panty Liners A Large Drum of Sir-Drinks-Alot A Genie in a Bottle A Magic Lamp A Magic Fart A Living Room Toilet A Warehouse Cheat Codes for Gruban, Rovert, and Gobos

      I was just watching the "Rikki Lake" news show on TV and saw an incredible feat!  A guy "sucked up" milk from a glass through his nose, and then squirted it in a stream about six feet away from him through his eye!  I'm not kidding!  He squirts it through his tear duct or something.  It's a thin little white stream, and he strains so hard I thought his head was going to explode.  As of this moment, I'm converting to a Rikki Lake fan!

      Boy, Trevor, are you ever the tall-standing "financial midget!"  Do you remember that clutch of old pennies you gave GAVE me for FREE?  Yesterday I was astute enough to get to a Border's bookstore and search out a coin book to find out their present value.  You're not gonna like what you hear!  Are you ready? Now I ONLY checked two of the coins, the 1935 D and the 1919.  To further flummox your "uncanny" financial cunning, I want you to know that the coins can fall into about 12 different gradings, or qualities that define the coin's condition.  Knowing that I further want you to know that these coins, though still SECOND from the BOTTOM in the grading scale were still worth, well, A BUNDLE!  Yes, the 1935 D weighed in with a value in U.S. dollars at $0.10 and the big winner, the 1919 penny stumbled across the finish line worth $0.15!  Of course, I fainted dead away and fell to the floor.  Several clerks had to attend to me to bring me around.  Lucky for me, I had the presence of mind to hold onto the two pennies with a tight fisted grip when I lost conciousness. After awaking, it felt as if prying fingers had tried to force open my fist; I think someone knew what I had.  Unfortunately, I am unable to identify the dishonest clerk because, well, I was out cold.  So, let that be a lesson learned!  Don't give away the chicken coop with the chickens ... how will you get eggs and toast for breakfast, and bacon and potatoes when you do that?  I'm calling up Brinks to drive me to the bank so I can put these in the safe deposit box!  Rich

       urlLink Google Bombing  is bad, m'kay?  I think that Google Bombing tarnishes the image people have of Google.  When someone can effectively modify the search results to obtain some random result, it's like biting an into an apple and finding the insides have been replaced with lard.  I'd like to think that when I search for something on the web, my results will be accurate and apply to the terms I am searching for.  I hope Google will come up with some way to detect when people are trying to create a "Google Bomb" so they can disfuse it before it goes off, but I doubt it.

      CMNN (Costa Mesa News Network) Sunday, June 6, 2003  Man Recovers Memory of UFO Abduction  A Costa Mesa man recovered his memory over the weekend, a memory of terrifying significance.  Richard Benson, a Costa Mesa man, the local town drunk, a known village idiot, and a notorious and obnoxious liar reported recovering a memory "stolen" from him by aliens from another world.  "Them aliens did something tricky to me, like forcing me to drink plenty of decent scotch whisky, a quart or better, then they stuffed my pocket with one-dollar bills, about three of them, and told me they were taking a human being from earth home with them to study.  I saw the aliens wrestle a banjo from the man because a banjo is a feared weapon of mass annoyance on their world and they swore they only did it to protect themselves."  The Costa Mesa then man took a long swig from a bottle wrapped in a brown paper bag before continuing.  "Yup, I knowed the man they took, too," bragged the foul-smelling tramp, "it was Trevor Burgan., and I last seen him whistling a tune and smiling as he walked up the gang-plank to the big spinning silver saucer that whisked him away to some far-off galaxy.  Yessir, I'm sure it was that Trevor fellow, because I ain't seen or heard from him since.  Yup.  Big round silver saucer with a giant metal coffee cup like thing as big as a condominium on top of the saucer.  Trevor was playing tricks on those alien rubes, too.  He was offering them boxes of Red Hots attached to rubber bands.  Those boxes of Red Hots snapped right back into Trevor's hands-that brought on big guffaws from the aliens.  But that was strange because those aliens laugh out of their ears and that takes some getting used too."  When pressed for more details regarding the abduction, the dapper dumpster diver said, "You all sure is kind of pressy, aren't you?"  After a few coins changed hands (dimes mostly) the bum continued. "They stole that Trevor fellow and told me if I ever told that they'd make me get a job and threatened me with full employment.  When I heard that, I lost total control of my bladder and wet myself in mortal fear.  I looked into each alien's eye-they had seven eyes apiece, each a different color-and I knew they were telling me the truth.  I was gonna have a real job if I couldn't keep my lips zipped."  Mr. Benson was then asked if Trevor had any last words to relay to his family or friends.  "Naw, not words as such.  But after he went aboard and the door closed behind him, I could hear the man whimpering.  Well, he wasn't whimpering, really.  It was more like he was crying.  Crying like a little girl is what it sounded like to me.  Yup, that's it.  Trevor Burgan, a grown man, was crying like a little girl because he was on a space ship and he was frightened.  Just like when a little girl starts blubbering because she spills chocolate ice cream on her new party dress.  Mr. Burgan sounded just like that.  Maybe he spilled something on his tie, or his slacks...I don't know.  I just know I was embarrassed by his behavior.  He's supposed to represent mankind like an ambassador, ain't he?  Then the saucer took off, straight up and disappeared. Well, I sure hope Trevor gets back to earth soon.  I'm sure he will.  Those aliens are probably ready for some new jokes, now that they've heard all of Trevors'-don't ya think?"

Perhaps I should actually post something with some substance for a change.  Well, don't get use to it, but here goes.    This weekend should be interesting.  It's the only weekend we have to prep the closet for the new fabulous  urlLink closet organizer thing  that's going to be installed the first week of March.  So, we have to move all the clothes out of the closet...that's a daunting task in itself because we don't have enough unused closet space in the house to hold all of our clothes at the same time, so my guess is that we are going to be stacking up hangers full of shirts on the floor for a week or two.  Then we have to buy a couple pry bars and some spackle so we can demolish the existing closet hardware and then cover it up with a nice fresh coat of paint.  If this turns out to be too difficult for our meager do-it-yourself skills - we have a handyman guy coming to give us a quote on how much it would cost for him to do the demo work.  Yeah, that's right - HANDYMAN.  Look, I don't want to end up with a crappy looking closet, so if it's cheap enough I'll pay someone to do it right.  What's wrong with that?  Should I feel ashamed because I was born without the home improvement gene?  I think not.

There's also custom made sausages, burgers and hot fresh potato chips.  Hooray for wood fired hot dogs!  Also, a new  urlLink Farmer Boys  burger place opened up nearby and right next to that some kind of Italian fast food place.

      In July we are Vegas bound, but this time with the kids.  This time we are going for  FIVE  days, which will be the longest we've ever stayed there.  For the first two nights we are staying at the  urlLink Mandalay Bay  and then we are moving to the  urlLink Hyatt - Lake Las Vegas  for the remaining three nights.  The Hyatt has a "kids club" that should allow Shireen and I to escape for some gaming for a few hours, so that will be nice.  If only we could skip the drive...flying isn't that expensive, but we need a car anyway to drive out to the Hyatt and it's just easier to take your own car.

There's a new  urlLink play place  over in the Mission Viejo Kaleidoscope center.  There's a small bounce house, a gravity ball constrution wall, two climb and slide structures and the huge, ball area with cannons, slingshots and all sorts of vaccuum hoses that deliver the balls around.   It costs  11 dollars per kid .  That's pretty expensive for a few hours of play, but it was fun and the kids did get tired.  There's a photo in the  urlLink wireless  section...

      Went to  urlLink BrewBakers  last night with Jon after work to bottle the batch of beer I made three weeks ago.  The gift certificate I bought at the silent auction last year was only for a half batch, which is supposed to be thirty six 22oz. bottles.  But, the bottling equipment was acting up so they gave me an extra six bottles, which I gave to Jon.    I have to admit, I was really impressed by the quality and freshness of the beer.  It didn't have any of the off flavors that typically come with "homebrew".  It definitely helps that they force carbonate it - I remember the homebrew back in the post-college days that had the thick layer of sediment on the bottom.  One false sip and whammo! You get a wallop of nasty sludge in your mouth!     Anyway, I chose the "Octoberfest-a-like" recipe which was named Mark's Marzen.  The pre-brewing sample they gave me to taste was really not at all like the beer I ended up with, so I'm thinking either it was mislabled or it was way too old.  Also, I found out that if you return the bottles you get 8 bucks a box credit to your next brew AND I also found out that every Thursday is "Brew a case" night, for 30 bucks you can brew a case and with the 24 dollars credit I have coming to me for my 3 boxes of bottles, a case would only be 6 bucks!

      There used to be a  urlLink Farrell's  over by the Montclair Plaza and I remember many good times going there when I was a kid.  They used to do this birthday alarm type thing where the guys would run around with this huge sundae on a "stretcher" type thing - I remember crying because the sound was so incredibly loud and scary (to a young kid anyway).  The coolest part was that after you ate at the restaurant, there was this "old time" candy store and our parents would let us get a sucker or something fun.

      Every time we go to the mall we are guaranteed a lengthy visit to the Hermit Crab kiosk.  Stone is facinated by the crabs and has wanted one for the longest time, but ever since he took his fish out of the tank to "smooth" him (translation, he wanted to pet his fish and it died as a result) I have resisted the purchase until he was ready to not kill his pet. Well, his birthday is coming up, so Mama and Papa Joon got him a couple crabs - Stone has named the sister crab "Crabilina" and the brother crab "Crab Cool".

Well, for some reason we messed up the Clash song - we ended it early because we got to the part where they start yelling stuff in spanish and I think everyone just got confused.  Otherwise it went pretty well...at least everyone  said  they liked it!
