       urlLink Pablo Picasso  was a 20th century painter who co-founded the movement of Cubism. Born in Malaga, Spain to an artistic family, Picasso was a prodigious child. His painted  urlLink First Communion  from the ages of 14 to 15. As a young man Picasso travelled several times to Paris, where he eventually dettled for over 50 years. The poverty and desperation of his early adulthood found expression in his Blue Period paintings, such as  urlLink La Vie  and  urlLink The Tragedy  (both 1903). By 1905, Picasso had met paramour Fernande Olivier and shifted to the warmer colors of his Rose Period, perhaps the most famous painting of which is that year's  urlLink Family of Saltimbanques . In 1907 he painted the famous  urlLink Les Demoiselles D'Avignon , and over the next years he developed, with Georges Braque, Cubism, first with somewhat stylized still lifes, such as 1909's  urlLink Carafe, Jug, and Fruit Bowl , and then with increasingly abstract works such as  urlLink Portrait of Ambroise Vollard  (1910) and  urlLink Landscape at Ceret  (1911). Picasso himself never painted any entirely abstract works, but there is no question that this first phase of Cubism (Analytic Cubism) paved the way for later abstract artists. In a sense, analytic cubism redefined conceptions of space as it relates to art. By 1913 or so, Picasso had moved on to what he called Synthetic Cubism, which generally involved more color and more straightforward depictions of objects than Analytic Cubism, as for example in  urlLink Guitar  (1913). Picasso had a fruitful career thereafter, working in other mediums and creating large scale works such as  urlLink Guernica  (1937) and  urlLink Night Fishing at Antibes  (1939). Generally, however, Picasso's Cubist period is considered to be the peak of his career, and Analytic Cubism in particular to be one of the most influential movements in 20th century art. It should be noted that Picasso was a complete jerk in his personal life.   urlLink Rene Descartes  was a philosopher and mathematician who invented the system of  urlLink Cartesian Coordinates . Prior to this innovation, algebra and geometry were seen as two generally separate branches of thought, and therefore Descartes is sometimes considered the father of analytic geometry. Descartes also formulated  urlLink Snell's Law of refraction  (leading me to wonder why it's not Descartes' Law of refraction). As a philosopher, Descartes expressed intense skepticism about all knowledge and the reliability of the senses. He is famous for his quote "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"), which in his treatise  urlLink Principia Philosophiae  he claims is the first statement that cannot be doubted. From this statement and other deductions, Descartes claimed to prove the existence of a benevolent God and to some extent the reliability of the senses, although I think these arguments are generally thought to be less convincing than our man Thomas Aquinas' "proofs" of God's existence. Descartes' skepticism was influential in European philosophy, and helped to pave the way for  urlLink Continental Rationalism , which emphasized the primacy of reason and deduction over empiricism and the senses.

       urlLink Charlie Chaplin  was a comedic actor and mime. Born to a family of stage performers, Chaplin is said to have begun his career at five years old, when his mother fell suddenly hoarse. He spent his childhood under difficult circumstances in London, and received just two years of formal education in his life. However, he found some success as a child actor, notably as part of the dance and variety troupe  Eight Lancashire Lads  and in the more formal theater as Billy the Page in  Sherlock Holmes . With the help of his brother Sydney, Chaplin became a comedian and eventually went on two tours of America. On his second tour, he caught the eye of Keystone Film Company founder Mack Sennett, and in 1914 Chaplin appeared in his first movie,  urlLink Making a Living . His second film,  urlLink Kid Auto Races at Venice , saw the first appearance of Chaplin's famous character The Tramp. Chaplin played The Tramp almost continuously until 1940, adding depth and humanity to the character's humor in films such as  urlLink The Kid  (1921),  urlLink The Gold Rush  (1925), and  urlLink City Lights  (1931). In 1919 Chaplin co-founded  urlLink United Artists  with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith. In 1940 Chaplin starred in  urlLink The Great Dictator , in which he retired The Tramp and introduced dialogue to his films. In the 1950s Chaplin fell victim to McCarthyism, and went into exile in Europe. He returned to the United States only once, in 1972, when he received a special Oscar for lifetime achievement. Of debatable sweetness is Chaplin's marital record: he married  urlLink four times , to two 16 year-olds, one twenty-something, and when he was 56, one 17 year-old. This last marriage was a success, and Oona and Charlie Chaplin were married for the rest of his life.   urlLink Stan Lee  was a comic book writer who created several well-known superheroes. Born Stanley Leiber, Lee began working for Timely Comics as an office boy at the age of 17, and he did his first work on an actual comic in 1941, for the third issue of  urlLink Captain America . In 1942 he was promoted to editor at Timely Comics (now known as Marvel Comics), but it was not until the 1960s that he began the experimentation and innovation for which he is now famous. In 1961 he and Jack Kirby produced the  urlLink Fantastic Four , and following its success Lee went on to create or co-create 90 percent of  urlLink Marvel's characters , including the  urlLink Incredible Hulk  and the  urlLink Amazing Spiderman  in 1962, the  urlLink X-Men  in 1963, and  urlLink DareDevil  in 1964. Among the innovations that made Lee's superheroes successful were increased "characterization" - personality flaws, ordinary problems, etc. - and the  urlLink Marvel Universe , which allowed the characters to share share storylines and interact with each other. Today there is  urlLink debate  over the extent to which Lee created some of the characters for which he is given credit. Stan Lee's characters have inspired several movies and television shows, and more than 2 billion of his comic books have been published to date.

      This was another tie vote. I don't think there's too much debate that climbing Mount Everest is sweeter in and of itself than flying a plane across the Atlantic, but a lot of people seemed to feel that Hillary might not deserve all the credit for this, what with the Sherpa factor. And I have to agree, it seems like Tenzing Norgay is getting a raw deal. In the end, I think if Edmund Hillary had actually said he wanted to climb Mount Everest "because it was there," he would have to be sweeter. Good quotes count for a lot with me. But evidently, he didn't say it. Therefore, I'm going to have to go with Lindbergh, who, no matter what else he may have been, was undeniably a bad ass.

      The vote on this one was tied 3 to 3, so I guess I'll have to decide for myself. My own personal opinion would probably have been Darwin, just because it seems so amazing that he came up with the theory of natural selection before so much of modern science, such as genetics or the concept of DNA, was well known. Plus, I actually find his theories convincing, whereas I've got to agree with Alex that Aquinas's reasoning doesn't really do it for me.  But in the end, I have to go with Aquinas based on the strength of Elgen's argument. If a million chumps came up with a million theories, and one of them turned out to be right way ahead of its time, we would all celebrate that person today as a genius. But with Aquinas, he believed the same things that everybody in his day ALREADY believed, yet he still made a name for himself by making his theories so confusing that nobody could prove him wrong.  That's got to count for something.

      This vote was pretty close - 5 to 4 by my count.  The big knock on Kurt Cobain seems to be that suicide is not sweet, which is pretty hard to refute.  I guess the corresponding knock on Al Pacino is that if you didn't see the Godfather movies, there's no way you would think he was sweeter than Kurt Cobain.  In other words, he has a limited repertoire of sweetness.  But I have a problem with that quibble, which is that, as Alex pointed out, Nirvana only put out two sweet studio albums.  It's just that when most of us were growing up, those albums were ubiquitous.  However, if we had been teenagers duing the 1970s, I bet the Godfather movies would have been nearly as ubiquitous, and we would have thought there was no way Kurt Cobain was sweeter than Al Pacino.  In the end, I'm going to have to give this one to Kurt Cobain for the simple reason that he wrote and performed so many sweet songs, whereas Al Pacino is essentially a performance artist only - I don't think he's written any sweet movies.  Maybe if he does, we can re-evaluate.  P.S.  Nobody even entered the fun trivia quiz to guess Al Pacino's second movie to have domestic gross box office receipts over $100 million.  But Deepak was the only person (at least that I saw) who even mentioned Dick Tracy in his argument, so I'll have to declare him the winner.  P.P.S.  I'm going to be moving tomorrow, so it's doubtful that I'll be able to post people for Who Is Sweeter?  I'm hoping I'll be able to do an entry for Wednesday though.  If anyone would be interested in writing an occasional entry some time in the future, please let me know.  I'm pretty busy at work about two weeks every quarter, and it would be a shame not to have blog entries during that time.  Thanks!

      On the last day before I move to Virginia, I want to salute two Maryland icons. Both of these guys get extra sweetness points because their names adorn the scholarship that put me through college.   urlLink Benjamin Banneker  was a prominent astronomer, surveyor, and inventor in colonial America. The son and grandson of freed slaves, Banneker displayed his inventive talents at 22 years old when he built a clock based on his studies of a pocket watch he borrowed from an acquaintance. The clock, built of wood, is believed to be the first striking clock built entirely in America and is said to have kept accurate time for between  urlLink 40  and  urlLink 50  years. During the years 1792 to1797 Banneker published  urlLink Ephemerides , for which he himself calculated the tides and the positions of celestial bodies and predicted the weather. Also in the 1790s, Banneker was one of the three surveyors of what is now Washington, D.C. When Pierre L'Enfant was dismissed as the planner of the new capital, he took his plans with him, but Banneker was able to reproduce them from his memory. Banneker was an early promoter of racial equality; his  urlLink 1792 letter  to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson noted the incongruity of Jefferson's writings and his slaveholding. As savvy readers will have surmised, Bannker's entreaties were  urlLink unsuccessful .   urlLink Francis Scott Key  wrote the words to  urlLink The Star Spangled Banner , the national anthem of the United States. A prominent attorney, Key made his name successfully defending Aaron Burr against  urlLink charges  of treason. He also defended Sam Houston in a trial in the U.S. House of Representatives on  urlLink charges  of beating another Congressman (unsuccessfully) and having corrupt dealings with the government (successfully). Key and his family were slave owners, but he felt the institution was morally wrong and took cases from slaves trying to win their freedom. In 1812, Key's friend Dr. William Beanes was captured by the British. Key went to the Chesapeake Bay, where Beanes was being held on a ship, and was able to negotiate his friend's release. However, the British would not let the men return to shore until after their attack on Fort McHenry was concluded. Key watched the 25 hour bombardment of the fort from a ship in the Bay, after which he was inspired to write the "Defence of Fort McHenry", which went on to become the national anthem. Later in his life Key became the United States District Attorney for Washington, D.C.

       urlLink Wilbur and Orville Wright  designed, built, and flew the first  urlLink controllable powered flying machine . The sons of a bishop who encouraged them to be active readers and thinkers, the brothers were good students from a young age. When Wilbur, the older brother, was nineteen, however, he was hit in the face while playing ice hockey, and resulting complications kept him from attending Yale University. The brothers soon began a biweekly publication called   urlLink The West Side News  . Its middling success led them to start a bicycle shop, and soon they began making their  urlLink own bicycles . The bicycle business was a success, but by 1896 the brothers wanted a new challenge, and they turned their attention to the new technological fad of flying machines. Their first two prototypes were failures due to insufficient lift, so they built a wind tunnel in their bicycle shop, where they tested over 200 wing shapes to find the most efficient one. In the process, they showed that the commonly accepted lift coefficient at the time was too high. By 1902, they had built the first gliding aircraft that could roll, pitch, and yaw, theoretically allowing control along all three dimensions of flight. On December 17, 1903, Orville piloted the  urlLink Wright Flyer 1 , a powered version of their glider, for 12 seconds and 120 feet in the air. For some reason this is what history has remembered, although the brothers'  urlLink Wright Flyer 3  was an immensely better machine, which in October 1905 Wilbur flew for 39 minutes and 24 miles, making it the first practical airplane and the basis for modern flight.   urlLink Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bronte  wrote the classic Romantic novels  urlLink Jane Eyre ,  urlLink Wuthering Heights , and  urlLink Agnes Grey , among others.  Jane Eyre  (written by Charlotte) was an immediate success, while  Wuthering Heights  and  Agnes Grey  (written by Emily and Anne, respectively, and originally published together) received  urlLink mixed reviews , deemed by many critics to be too violent, coarse, and depressing - including this one, had I been alive. However, today  Wuthering Heights  is generally  urlLink considered  one of the finest of the Romantic novels, and sometimes one of the finest novels in the English language. My mother has pointed out that the Brontes' novels were some of the first to acknowledge that women had a sex life, and certainly the Bronte sisters and their novels carved a place in feminist history with their convincing portrayals of women as strong and complicated protagonists. Of the sisters' personal lives, little detail survives. The daughters of a parson, the sisters were educated under terrible conditions, which are thought to have weakened their constitutions permanently. Nonetheless they had active imaginations, inventing fantasy lands named Angria and Gondal and writing poetic sagas about them.  urlLink Emily  died of tuberculosis at the age of 30, having caught a cold at her brother's funeral.  urlLink Anne  died less than a year later at the age of 29, also of tuberculosis. Perhaps most tragically,  urlLink Charlotte  died of tuberculosis several years later, pregnant and only months after her marriage.

      Bucky won this contest pretty easily, but I have to say that I don't think either of these guys really lives up to their hype. Some people stuck up for Bucky's map though, and I have to admit it's pretty sweet. Emerson's poetry, on the other hand, is dreadful.

       urlLink Mike Tyson  is a professional boxer who at the age of 20 became the youngest heavyweight champion ever. He won the WBC title on November 22, 1986 by defeating Trevor Berbick, and by August 1, 1987, he had won the WBA and IBF titles to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. In 1988 he had two of his best remembered fights, a fourth round technical knockout of a diminished Larry Holmes, and a demolition of previously undefeated (professsionally) Michael Spinks in just over 91 seconds. However, his career began heading downhill shortly thereafter, as chaos engulfed his personal life and he lost focus in his career. In 1990 he lost a somewhat controversial fight to James "Buster" Douglas in a tenth round knockout. On February 10, 1992 he was convicted of raping an 18 year old beauty contestant, and he went to prison for three years. Upon his release he was able to regain the WBC and WBA titles, but his 1996 fight with Evander Holyfield ended in an 11th round TKO for Holyfield. In the 1997 rematch,  urlLink Tyson bit  Holyfield's  urlLink ear  not once but twice, getting a significant chunk- and disqualified- the second time. Since then he has had continuing brushes with the law and only one meaningful fight, which he  urlLink lost to champion Lennox Lewis  during the eighth round of brutality. Now he is a  urlLink raving lunatic  of steadily diminishing relevance.   urlLink Bobby Fischer  is the only American to have been a FIDE world chess champion. In 1956, he won the U.S. Junior championship at the age of 13, and in 1958 he won the U.S. Championship at the age of 14 years and 9 months, scoring 8 wins, 5 draws, and no losses. Over the next decade he dominated national competition, winning 7 more U.S. Championships. His  urlLink final record  in U.S. Championships was 61 games won, 26 games drawn, and 3 games lost. In 1962 he won the 'Interzonal' competition in Stockholm, Sweden, becoming the first non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal. In 1967 he withdrew from the Interzonal in Sousse, Tunisia, despite leading with 7 wins and 3 draws. In 1969 he refused to participate in the U.S. Championship, but several players deferred to Fischer to allow him to play in the Interzonals. After winning the Interzonal, he destroyed Mark Taimanov, Brent Larsen, and Tigran Petrosian to establish himself as the clear challenger to World Champion Boris Spassky. In July 1972 the match between  urlLink Fischer and Spassky  began after substantial wrangling about revenues and arrangements. Fischer lost the first game and did not show up for the second, which he lost by forfeit. However, he won 3 of the next 4 games and went on to win the match 12.5-8.5, becoming World Champion and the first player with a FIDE ELO rating over 2700. Thereafter, Fischer did not play another official game until 1992, forfeiting his title in 1975 to Anatoly Karpov when FIDE would not accept his demands for how the match would be played. In 1992 he traveled to Yugoslavia for a rematch with Spassky in violation of a United Nations embargo against the country. Since then, he has been a fugitive from United States justice, although he was recently apprehended in Japan and may be deported soon. Now he is a  urlLink raving lunatic  of steadily diminishing relevance.

      Rachel Carson won this one rather handily. I think her Silver Spring connections helped her, as did people's general indifference toward Johnny Carson. Although personally, I think Curtis was on to something when he pointed out that not a single poster said they had read any of Rachel Carson's books. It seems like she's dining on her name here to me.

       urlLink Charles Lindbergh  became the first man to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo in 1927. The flight, which took 33 and a half hours aboard a one engine airplane, was also the first non-stop flight from New York City to Paris. It made Lindbergh a national hero in the United States, and in 1928 he received the Medal of Honor for the feat. He was thereafter quite influential in the budding aviation industry, helping to develop techniques to use less fuel in flight, pioneering commercially viable flight routes between the United States and the rest of the world, and becoming an important early supporter of Robert Goddard's experiments in rocketry. In the 1930s he developed an  urlLink artificial heart pump , in connection with surgeon Alex Carrel, which allowed an organ to stay alive outside the body by circulating fluids through it. Lindbergh's reputation suffered somewhat with the outbreak of World War II because of his isolationist views on foreign policy. However, Lindbergh flew several successful combat missions in the Pacific Theater, despite technically being barred from combat duty because he would not renounce his pre-war views (see  urlLink this link  for a sympathetic account). Notable in his personal life was the  urlLink kidnapping and murder  of his son, which resulted in a highly public search and trial, and an abundance of conspiracy theories, including one that he personally was the killer. In 2003 it was revelaed that he had a longstanding affair and three children with Brigitte Hesshaimer, a German woman 24 years his junior.   urlLink Edmund Hillary  was the first man to climb Mount Everest successfully, in 1953. He made the climb as part of an expedition led by John Hunt, but Hillary and Tenzing Norgay were the only members of the party able to make the final summit, which at 29,028 feet above sea level is the highest point on Earth. In 1958 he was a leader of the third successful, and first mechanized, expedition to the South Pole. In 1975 he traveled by boat from the mouth of the Ganges river in India to its source in the Himalayas. He has devoted much of his effort to aiding the Sherpa people of Nepal, chiefly through the Himalayan Trust and  urlLink American Himalayan Foundation , which build schools and hospitals and do environmental conservation work in Nepal. Edmund Hillary was knighted in 1953, and became a member of the Order of the Garter in 1995. In 2003 he became the first foreign national to receive honorary citizenship from the Nepalese government.

      First off, I have to say that I was surprised by how negative everyone's feelings toward Disney and Ford were. Sure, they both pretty much sucked as people, but shouldn't being ahead of your time count for something?  Second, the victory probably would have gone to Walt Disney, seeing as how he did win 30 academy awards, and I liked The Little Mermaid (et al) as much as the next guy. But then I discovered that Walt Disney wasn't a real person. Thanks for the tip, Anonymous!  Wait a minute - what if Anonymous is also a fake person created by the government? Intense, man...  Finally, in defense of Henry Ford, I should say that although Alex is right on in pointing out that the assembly line had a pretty negative effect in terms of turning people into automatons, in a way this effect has been transitory as the economy has shifted away from manufacturing and toward services, which tend to be more intellectual and individualized. However, the improvement in material living standards resulting from the assembly line has proved permanent (at least so far).  Also, I thought Becky made an interesting point about artists and death (see also  urlLink Sailing to Byzantium  by William Butler Yeats).  However, I feel obliged to point out that the whole Walt Disney cryogenics things is a  urlLink myth .  His death certificate shows that he was cremated by an employee of Forest Lawn mortuary in Glendale, CA.

       urlLink Charles Darwin  was a naturalist who formulated the theory of natural selection as the mechanism for evolution. His father had hoped he would become a physician, but his squeamishness led him away from medicine and eventually he studied natural history and geology. In 1831 he left England aboard the HMS Beagle for a five year expedition to South America. While on the voyage Darwin collected evidence of new species, which he catalogued meticulously, and much of which he sent back to the British Museum. Upon returning from his voyage, he analyzed the specimens he had collected, and noticed that the tortoises and birds of the various Galapagos islands had superficial differences in diet and appearance, but exhibited an underlying similarity. Eventually this and other discoveries led him to postulate that a struggle for survival among the individuals of a species allows the most fit individuals in the population to be the most likely to survive and breed, thus passing their more fit traits to their offspring. Over time, this process would lead to the most fit traits becoming dominant among the population. Darwin realized that this theory would be very controversial, and he spent quite a bit of time testing and analyzing it before publishing his book  urlLink On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection  in 1859 (he had introduced a paper with a similar name the previous year). He went on to write several more books and papers, most notably  urlLink The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex  (1871), in which he postulated the theory of sexual selection and the idea that humans are descended from apes.   urlLink Thomas Aquinas  is the most influential theologian of the Catholic Church. Born to a noble family in southern Italy, Thomas was sent early in life to study at the monastery of Monte Cassino, but decided to enter the new Dominican Order against the wishes of his parents. He went to study in Cologne and Paris with Albertus Magnus, who introduced him to the works of Aristotle. Aquinas devoted much of his career to reconciling traditional concepts of faith with the rationalism of Aristotle. His two most famous works are   urlLink Summa contra Gentiles  , in which he attempts to show for a non-Christian audience that God must necessarily exist, and that certain things about God must be true, and   urlLink Summa Theologica  , which summarizes and reasons for almost all of the Catholic doctrines. In the  Summa Theologica  Aquinas articulates  urlLink Five Ways  of showing the existence of God, including famous versions of the  urlLink Cosmological Argument  and the  urlLink Teleological Argument . Aquinas died in 1274, was canonized in 1323, and was pronounced a Doctor of the Church in 1568.

       urlLink Al Pacino  is an actor who has played such memorable roles as Michael Corleone in  The Godfather  series, Tony Montana in  Scarface , Sonny Wortzik in  Dog Day Afternoon , and Col. Frank Slade in  Scent of a Woman . After dropping out of school at the age of 17, he began studying at the Actors Studio in 1966 under Lee Strasberg, who created the Method Approach to acting. He began making a name for himself in musical theater, first in the off-Broadway production of  The Indian Wants the Bronx  (1966-67), and then in  Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie , for which he won a Tony award in 1969. His film debut came in that year's  Me, Natalie , and in 1971 he gained critical praise for his portrayal of a heroin addict in  The Panic in Needle Park . Francis Ford Coppola chose him over the objections of the studio and cast to play the part of Michael Corleone in  The Godfather  (1972), and Pacino spent much of the shoot worried that he would be fired. However, he received the first of his  urlLink 8 Academy Award nominations  for his performance, and the rest of his career is history. Since then, he has turned down parts in a slew of famous movies:  Star Wars  (1977, as Hans Solo),  Kramer vs. Kramer  (1979),  Apocalypse Now  (1979),  Born on the Fourth of July  (1989),  Pretty Woman  (1990), and  Crimson Tide  (1995). Yet he has also managed to become nominated for the Best Lead Actor Academy Award three years in a row, and to become the only man ever to be nominated as both Best Supporting Actor and Best Lead Actor in the same year. He also has returned to the stage, winning another Tony Award in 1977 for  The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel . In the interests of balance, it should also be noted that he appeared in  Gigli  (2003), which is currently rated the 16th worst film of all time at IMDB.com. Fun trivia quiz: only two of Al Pacino's movies have earned domestic gross box office receipts of $100 million. The first was  The Godfather  in 1972. Can anyone guess the second from this  urlLink list of performances ?  Don't cheat!   urlLink Kurt Cobain  was the most influential musician of the 1990s. He was born in Hoquiam, Washington, and grew up in nearby Aberdeen, Washington, where he led a troubled childhood, at one point, as has been well-documented, living under a bridge. He bought his first guitar at the age of fourteen, and in 1986 he formed the band Nirvana with his friend Krist Novoselic on bass, Chad Canning on drums, and Cobain as the frontman. In 1989 the band released its first album,  Bleach , and shortly thereafter Canning was replaced by Dave Grohl, resulting in the lineup for which the band is probably best remembered. In 1991 Geffen records bought the band's contract, and the band's second album,  urlLink Nevermind , went on to become a huge hit, selling more than 10 million copies and reportedly making $550 million. The album reached number one on the Billboard charts in January 1992, dethroning Michael Jackson's  Dangerous  in an act of almost sickening symbolism. The album's first track,  Smells Like Teen Spirit , was rated as the best song of the past 25 years by VH1 in 2003. (If you're wondering why we should listen to them, it's because  urlLink their list  is easy to find. But for excellent humor value, try doing a search on  urlLink MTV.com  and looking at the ads.)  In 1992, Nirvana released  Incesticide , a compilation of b-sides and outtakes that reached number 39 on the Billboard charts. In 1993 the band released its final studio recording,  urlLink In Utero , which also made it to number one on the Billboard charts, as did the 1994 concert album  urlLink Unplugged in New York  (released after Cobain's death). After a long struggle with heroin addiction and other medical troubles, Kurt Cobain committed suicide on April 5th, 1994.

      First off, I want to say thanks to everyone who posted on this entry. You're the best!  In other news, Isaac Newton has won the inaugural round of Who Is Sweeter, besting Mohandas Ghandi in a very tense showdown.  I definitely didn't know who I thought was sweeter in this one - that's why I had to put up a blog.  I also didn't think any of the arguments that were posted necessarily blew away all of the others, so I am going to go with the popular vote here, which by my count was 9 for Newton, 5 for Ghandi.  If you didn't post and you don't like the results, please post next time.  If you did post and you don't like the results, please be more convincing next time.  There is still one more day for the Kissinger vs. Bismarck contest.

       urlLink Buckminster Fuller  was one of the most diversely talented people of our time. The author of 28 books, he also received 45 patents, 47 honorary doctorates, and several architectural awards. Yet at the age of 32, he nearly committed suicide on account of his bleak circumstances. Today he is probably most famous for his invention of the  urlLink geodesic dome , a dwelling that is cheaper, stronger, lighter, and more energy efficient than a comparable traditional house (as a side note, my Aunt Karen wants to build a bucky dome when she retires). He also invented the  urlLink Dymaxion Map , the first map to show the Earth on a flat surface without any visible distortion of the spatial relationships between land maps. He became the first person to receive a patent for a cartographic system for this innovation. Some of his other inventions include the Dymaxion Car, which has only three wheels, and the World Game, which from what I can tell does not sound very fun. The molecule  urlLink buckminsterfullerene , more commonly known as a buckyball, is named in his honor.   urlLink Ralph Waldo Emerson  was an American writer and philosopher who founded the movement of  urlLink American Transcendentalism  and helped to inspire Henry David Thoreau, Louisa May Alcott, and Walt Whitman. Descended from a line of Unitarian ministers, Emerson was ordained a minister at the Second Church of Boston in 1829. His wife, Ellen Tucker, died of tuberculosis in 1831, and the next year Emerson resigned as a pastor due to theological differences with the mainstream Unitarian community. In 1836 he published a collection of essays entitled  urlLink Nature , and two more sries of essays,  urlLink Essays and Essays: Second Series , in 1841 and 1844 respectively. The major philosophical thrust of his work was a rebuttal to the empiricism of John Locke that was fashionable at the time. For instance, in the first paragraph of his essay  urlLink History  he wrote:   He that is once admitted to the right of reason is made a freeman of the whole estate. What Plato has thought, he may think; what a saint has felt, he may feel; what at any time has be-fallen any man, he can understand. Who hath access to this universal mind is a party to all that is or can be done, for this is the only and sovereign agent.   More enduring than Emerson's individual philosophy, however, was his role in creating and encouraging a distinctly American movement that was not content to emulate European scholarship and culture. I would love to know how people feel about his poetry (available if you follow the link on his name); it did not really do much for me.

       urlLink Rachel Carson  was a biologist whose 1962 book on pesticide use,  urlLink Silent Spring , re-awakened the environmental protection movement in the popular consciousness. Carson spent fifteen years as a government scientist, and wrote three other well-regarded books:  Under the Sea-Wind  (1941),  The Sea Around Us  (1951), and  The Edge of the Sea  (1955), the last of which spent 86 weeks on the bestseller list. The New York Times wrote in her obituary that she had a "...remarkable knack for taking dull scientific facts and translating them into poetical and lyrical prose that enchanted the lay public..." She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously in 1980.   urlLink Johnny Carson  was the regular host of  The Tonight Show  on NBC from October 2, 1962 to May 22, 1992. He hosted 4,531 episodes in all, and his final show had an estimated audience of fity million viewers. Prior to hosting  The Tonight Show , Carson hosted three variety shows,  The Squirell's Nest ,  Carson's Cellar , the  Johnny Carson Show , and a quiz show,  Earn Your Vacation . He also wrote for  The Red Skelton Show , on which he received his break as a substitute host when Red Skelton was injured during a rehearsal. Essentially, Johnny Carson entertained America for thirty years, which has to be a tough job when you think about it. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1992.

      The thing I like about this contest is that both men were such an odd mix of cretin and visionary.   urlLink Walt Disney  produced the first feature-length animated film (Snow White, 1937). He was also an innovator in producing "talking" cartoons and in mixing live action with animation. His character  urlLink Mickey Mouse  has starred in at least 120 films and in 1935 was recognized by the League of Nations as "a symbol of universal good will". Walt Disney opened Disneyland in 1955, leading to a chain of theme parks with locations in Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, and Tokyo. Allegations that he was a Nazi sympathizer are debatable, but his complicity with the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Hollywood blacklist is a matter of historical record. As of this post, the Walt Disney Company (ticker  urlLink DIS ) had a market capitalization of approximately $46.7 billion.   urlLink Henry Ford  made automobiles affordable to the middle class. He had built his own internal combustion engine by the age of 15. His company began selling the  urlLink Model T  in 1908, and by 1918 Model Ts accounted for half the cars in America. Ford introduced moving assembly lines to his plant in 1913, marking a new era in American industrial development. He also paid his employees quite generously at $5 a day in 1913. In the 1920s Ford published a series of anti-Semitic articles collectively called "The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem".  In 1938 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the German Eagle, Nazi Germany's highest award for foreigners.  Later in his life Ford denounced anti-Semitism. In 1936 he established the  urlLink Ford Foundation , one of the wealthiest private philanthropic organizations in the world, with an investment portfolio of $9.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2003. As of this post, the Ford Motor Company (ticker  urlLink F ) had a market capitalization of approximately $26.9 billion.

      The winner of this contest is probably not the third sweetest person of all time, but then, not many people are.   urlLink Henry Kissinger  was the premier diplomat of the 20th century. He was the driving force in the United States of detente with the Soviet Union and of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, which slowed nuclear escalation between the two powers during the Cold War. He was also instrumental in the normalization of relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China. His 1973 Nobel Peace Prize has not innoculated him against charges that he engineered the U.S. bombing campaigns in Cambodia, patronized Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, and involved himself in various other sundry ventures.   urlLink Otto von Bismarck  was the premier diplomat of the 19th century. He was the architect of the German Empire, which he consummated chiefly by provoking successful wars with Denmark, Austria, and France. As the Empire's first chancellor, he was generally a reactionary against forces of social liberalization, but he also implemented mandatory pensions and health and accident insurance for workers.

      The winner of this contest is quite possibly the third sweetest person of all time.  To summarize:   urlLink M.K. Ghandi  was the greatest leader in the quest for an independent, democratic India, human history's most populous functioning democracy. Additionally, he pioneered the concept of non-violent protest as an effective tool for achieving political and social change.   urlLink Isaac Newton  was the greatest physicist of all time. He defined gravity mathematically and laid out laws of motion that formed the basis for classical mechanics. Newton also developed (concurrently with, but independently of, Gottfried Liebniz) much of calculus.  Many thanks to  urlLink Wikipedia , to which I intend to link frequently, and which I intend to plagiarize shamelessly!

      Hi everyone, thanks for visiting my blog. The basic concept is that every weekday, I will post two people, along with a brief summary of their lives and achievements. Then, my fanatical reader base will have one week to weigh in on which competitor is sweeter, and why. Remember: sweetness is in the eye of the beholder, but please try to explain your positions. At the end of the week, I will render my verdict, which shall be indisputable and shall stand forever as the definitive judgment of the two parties' respective sweetness. So remember, if you want to have a say in these weighty matters, you must post early and post often!  Please be patient with me while I try to figure out how to do columns, pictures, and all of that good stuff.
