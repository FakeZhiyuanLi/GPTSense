      Though some have passed mildly into the darkness Let not our love, our life, be so For you are the same God that shouted down from Sinai And brooded over the chaos And churned the Galilean Sea.  No, do not permit our fire to fail with a squelch Or a pitiful sigh But rather let the trumpets proclaim That here, among the dust, you have planted the light of more that two  thousand suns.  Let it be more than just a muted whisper Let there be a call to arms And a call to worship For that is what you have wrought With your fire In my heart.  _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

      I just hurt.  The why's are too many.  The what's are all around me.  I am  full of jagged glass.  Full of hot pain.  I just hurt.  It seems like  everywhere I turn, I see more pain, and I can't bear to behold it any  longer.  I don't even know what not bearing it would look like.  I've opened  every drawer.  Every closet.  Under every pillow and blanket.  Pain.  I  think it will go away.  I know it will.  And then I wonder, what will come  of all this time and all this hurt.  I'm sure it will be something.   Something good.  It always happens that way.  I am blinded by it right now,  though.  It is like blood running down my face.  I just hurt.  _________________________________________________________________ Overwhelmed by debt?

      It has been so long since I last slept until I wanted to wake up that it  seems surreal.  Like I am shirking some major duty.  Today I did, though;  right in the middle of the day.  Sara is on the phone, talking to her mother  in Reno.  She is mostly uh-huhing and it makes me laugh.  The kids are  beginning to get restless.  "Take us to the pool," and I have no such  aspirations.  I have tomorrow off, as well, and I hope to actually attend church.  I doubt that I will be able to, however, because we have some foster kids and Sara is not doing well.  It has  been more than a month since I have because we have been so insanely busy.   I don't want to be too busy for church.  It makes me crazy when I can't go.   It's the anchor of my week.  Worship is too wonderful for me to describe.   It is a beauty beyond the ability of the pen to capture.  We sketch it, and  as we do we hunt it in our souls.  But true worship is too big to be  captured.  It is to be chased, touched, over come by, awoken from, and then  chased again.  Jamie

      I have never BLOGGED before per se.  I have been flogged, however, if that counts.  For what, I don't know.  But, well, nevermind.  Anyway, I will be posting random things on here from time to time, and that, I am told, is blogging.    So, off we go.   Jamie
