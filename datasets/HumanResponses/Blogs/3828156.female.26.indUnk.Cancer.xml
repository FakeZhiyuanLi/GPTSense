      So I shook Bill Clinton's hand and had him sign my book at his book signing at Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. I tell ya, I almost gave up many times. I was near the end of a 1700 person line, and Bad Bill arrived late. Overall, I arrived at 7, and was looking Mr. Pres in the eye at about 10:40. He looked exhausted!! And he had a devious look about him.. Ashley from our cohort filled me in on a tip that PEARL JAM may be making a surprise performance at the Showbox. Dammit, she was right. I WAS SO CLOSE TO LEAD SINGER EDDIE VEDDER!!!! STILL, THE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENT OVERWHELMS ME!!! AHHHHHH...  I worked at the Northwest Summer Brewfest at St. Edwards State park in Kenmore. Wow, quite a time that was. Everyone there at the event was pretty much hammered. Except the staff. I got lotsa free t-shirts and fake tatoo's. Which is good enough for me.

      Mine was unbelievable! We had such a blast. Inside jokes, innocent schemes, coffee runs, celebrating student acheivement! I couldn't have ahd a better gal to work with. Some people say that phrase often. I say it only when I truly mean it.

      I got one in LWSD. As far as I can tell, I will be teaching first grade at Mark Twain Elementary. I am stokked beyond belief. The amount of spare time I have had has allowed me to create parent letters, open house plans, posters, etc. I have come up with some really cool parent night activities.. I am such a dork.

      Mine sucked. Cal just called me today and informed me of the NUMEROUS grammatical errors in my paper. These included missing pieces, wrong citations, etc. As a matter of fact, it is so bad that I need to revise it, re-submit it for him and the reader, they will recheck it, then if all is good, I can bind it... Oh, For the Love of God.

      At my interview for LWSD, I was asked some question about classroom managment and how I handle disruptive kids. I responded with something like " Well, I let the behavior go until it interferes with others. Then I just nail em." I guess they really didn't like that response, because they called up the principal of the school I was student teaching at and asked her if I was an "authoritative" type. My advice: do not make any references as to the crucifixition of your students during your interview.

      If you were there, what did you think? I kept looking for a familiar face on the big screen. I ran in way late, at about 11:02. As I was running up to the Key, a homeless man is sitting there, looks at me, and says "YOU'RE LATE". ... Thanks buddy.... It was cool to see like Kay Rice, the art teacher lady, Tad, Farah, Cal,etc... It was boring, but hey , as is a graduation ceremony. If you weren't there: Please list your good reason here:

      Hey former cohorters,  I thought it would be cool to set up a weblog so we can communicate and keep in touch with each other. Please post comments and let us all know what you are doing this summer/ job status/ etc. Also, some funny, inspiring and interesting student teaching stories would be good. I realize many of you are probably on vacation. Not me, I have no money, no job, and nowhere to go. Hence, this weblog... Anyways, hope you guys will post on here. Click on a category on the right that fits your post. May the road rise to meet you, Amy N.
