      Back in the land of square bread and satisfying fonts (ever noticed how satisfying the font is on the London Underground?). I'm feeling utterly uninspired, mainy due to the sticky keyboard I am currently contending with. But also because leaving is always a funny thing, much funnier than arriving. And because I didn't get in to Manchester. And because the future doesn't look enormously wildly orange at the moment.   I had a fine welcome home though, pint and chat with the Rob and the Hav and a ride in a real hackney carriage. And I had a fine seeing off too- all you can eat pakora with the best of Brussels. If any of you read this, you can always drop me a line here...  Right. Tea in hand, I am off to face my fears. Is blind date still running on a Saturday night this side of the channel?  Bisous...

      Tomorrow I leave Brussels. Tomorrow I leave Brussels. Tomorrow I leave Brussels. Weird huh.   Last night I was treated to the most divine evening courtesy of the delectable Tatum. I was plied liberally with drinks, led up a dark forest path... and taken to the theatre. Very magical. We went to see a play called No Man's Land, based on the film with the same name. It was very good, but I must say that the highlight was the bald-headed luvvy who graced the stage. mmmmmm... men with a talent.... If there is one good thing about Brussels, it's that famous people are never really that famous. You drink in a bar after a show, and you'll be drinking with the stars of it. And that's fine by me.   I'm haunted by last night's wine now... and I'm panicking at all of the things I really have to do before I leave. Somehow I think a few things are going to have to drop off the list. But I suppose flats were never really meant to be clean. I can say I'm aiming for the lived-in look.   I have just been given the most lovely present by Dave, mr boss man (rob, don't be fooled, it aint my MEP starting a blog, although you never know...) I am now the proud owner of a book of pomes and a card with smarties all over it. Happy.

       When the chips are down...    To continue my last week of fun in the Belgian capital, we went to a bar called Tavernier last night in the student quarter. And this is what we noticed. It is incredible how dirt and mess can become a fashion. What is it with foreign students and letting everything hang loose?  Anyway, we went to see a band heralded as jazz/funk/slam, who were playing as part of the jazzbreaks spring festival. I was quite excited, imagining young spritely things with a talent for words and giving it a little with their instruments. A good night out, we thought. Unfortunately, it sounded more like dad doing an impression of the beastie boys with his head down a toilet, accompanied by a sitar and sax combo- they really shouldn't have bothered. (The night before a German youth orchestra was playing in the Parliament. They kicked the other lot's sorry asses.)   The night ended in usual style with a trip to the local Kebaberia. May I strongly recommend the pita merguez, sauce pili-pili. Belgium is truly the home of good after-pub troffing. The chips are fine. The kebabs are fine. But the durums... Oh, the durums. We're talking a lebanese tortilla wrap, filled with chicken, salad, onions, sauce and chips. It's so balanced. It's a meal in itself. A meal in a wrap. A meal fit for a king. A drunken festering rotten old king.   Feeling surprisingly chipper today. Two more to go...

       The lady speaks   So here I am, pathetically yapping at the heels of my brother and starting a blog.  I have stage fright. Can I live up to the precedent set for me by my creative older sibling? Nah, but then I do have youth on my side....  So follow me, do. In the next few days you will discover the truth behind the Great British dream. Moving to Watford. Where the streets are paved with gold and life is that little bit sweeter... Or so they told me. When they signed me up for the job.  If the postings stop suddenly, be so kind as to call the emergency services...

      And then it all fell around my ears with a resounding crash, a satisfying crunch, and a heart-wrenching groan. My carefully constructed wall of optimism has been bulldozed by a visit to IKEA, leaving me somewhat gibbering and incredibly unpleasant to be around. There I was, amongst all my sold-off furniture, amongst home after set-up ideal home, debating the relative merits of long steel and little button handles for PAX wardrobes, thinking sadly of how I didn't have a home, didn't have a place to set up a home, had no money to set up a home, had no one to set up a home with.   I mean, jeez, jesusmarymother of god, jeez, as if I even want to set up a home! I mean, it's not as if I am little miss domestic bliss, apron tied in a sweet little bow at the front, plaits dangling tweely over each ear, cookies baking in the oven. Nope, me, I'm the galavanting independent woman. I'm the jetsetter with no ties and no fears.   Oh I don't know, it just seems a little scary I suppose. Here I sit, AT HOME, and I don't feel homelike at all, and I don't feel as privileged as I damn well should.  On a lighter note, I see that that Bennett lad has come a-visiting. Which is nice. My heart skipped a little to know that he is in the country again. More plans are afoot for the party of the century (note to self, don't build it up, bound to be a disappointment that way). Also excited about the Jewel's imminent wedding. There are more imminent weddings than I can shake my new spankin phone at. Ahhhhhh... love and coupledom bliss. Question. How weird will it be to have dinner with 4 couples on the night of my birthday? Yep, weird. Weirdass. Rubbbbbbbish. (Not the company folks, don't get offended, just the asymmetry).

      Natasha, it doesn't help.   so yesterday I got daily contact lenses. Visible results within the hour. The Amnesty International market researcher on St Peters Street chatted me up in his sexy little scottish accent- "so what colour are your eyes then?" "green" "they've got orange bits in" Ha!!!! As if that would have happened through inch thick spectaculoos. Man magnet, here I come.   I also got a spankin new phone. It has a camera, it has a radio. It has far more technology than this girl should ever be let loose with. I briefly considered posting my number on this site (blogging has reduced my urge to email!) but then realised that all the perverts in the world would then be given free rein (reign?) to groom me. (Yeah, like they're not more interested in hardcore porn sites and unsuspecting teenagers...)  I am drinking wine tonight. I am most decidedly drinking wine tonight. And eating small portions.   To all who pass, may the weekend fill you with joy and delight.   Ax

      This game closely resembles Simon Says, with Commander Bibblybobs as the upper class replacement for Simon the Pieman   Ingredients:   3-10 ready and willing and slightly drunken participants full glasses working hands   Aims:   To get people drunker. To make participants to look like idiots in public places. To make others think you are in a cult.   How to play:  Participants sit round a large table with fingers laid on the table. The Commander is assigned and will call instructions. All instructions preceded by "Commander" must be followed accurately. All instructions followed without a preceding "Commander" will incur a liquid forefeit of the group's choice. The Commander may also suffer forefeits, should he not follow his own instructions correctly.    The moves:    Commander bibblybobs:  Rap fingers of both hands against the table.  Commander Mrs Bobs:  Cross hands over continually while continuing to rap the fingers  Commander right hand high:  Left hand continues to rap, right hand held aloft  Commander right hand low:  As before, with right hand held under the table (the last two moves can also be performed with the left hand, should Commander bibblybobs so instruct you)  Commander dead spiders:  Both hands turn upside down with fingers waving towards the ceiling  Commander Justin:  Right hand on rippling abs, left hand aloft, wiggle body, screw face up, sing high "I just wanna love you baby" This should bedone in time. Forfeits for mimers, anyone in tune and anyone singing out of time.  Commander Tony:  Right hand comes across body in afirm position with fingers pointing to the left. Look grave and slightly pained.Speak "Education, education, education". With each "education" bring the right hand forward towards the audience, for greater emphasis.  Commander posh:  Point right hand index finger to player opposite, speak "thanks for the porsche dad"  Commander Ford Austin gear box:  Right hand to side, go through gears, speaking "1, 2, 3, 4"  Any of the bove moves without the preceding commander is a TRICK and must not be obeyed. You must invent new commands with each round played, starting with the most basic and eventually adding your own.When this happens, do share.   Just to give you a taste, try this at home:   Commander bibblybobs Commander Mrs Bobs Commander bibblybobs Commander right hand high Commander bibblybobs  Commander Ford Austin gear box Commander bibblybobs Commander posh Commander Mrs Bobs Commander bibblybobs Commander Tony Commander bibblybobs Commander Justin Commander bibblybobs Mrs Bobs   Do you feel like a tit yet?

      This coming weekend I'm off to the bright lights of Pontins Prestatyn to attend the 25th Annual 'Queen' Convention. I've always promised a mate that I would go with him one year, and now that time has come. There's five of us in the same grotty chalet, and apparently everything revolves around Queen for the four day duration (Queen Quiz, Queen disco, Queen darts, Queen croquet, Queen scuba diving etc).There will be all kinds of freaks on show dressed as Freddy Mercury and Brian May, but when I suggested that we all go as different Queens (Elizabeth the first, Anne Boleyn etc) nobody seemed impressed.  Now let me explain. This is not me, nor is it my words. But I thought this little gem from the Monk brother was far superior, far funnier, far more farfetched than anything I could conjur up that I thought I'd borrow it. (for him it is true by the way. Imagine.)  As for me, well... I've been venturing out into the big wild world, visiting working water-powered flour mills in the peak, driving (passengering- note to self, must learn to drive now) in the beautiful open countryside, eating home-made soda bread, shopping at outlet stores. I bought trainers. I tried for brown, I tried for red, but the green ones bit me on the bum as usual and I am now the proud owner of a bargain pair of green as can be golas. You'll see them if you come to my party...   To finish, a top 5, as advised by bloggod:   Current top 5 songs to wallow to:  1. the whole of  Sea Change  2.Tracy Chapman's  the Promise  (I challenge you to not think of your own funeral while listening) 3.  Fugitive Motel   4.  Half a world away , for Bennett, who I have a feeling is that very thing 5.  Lover, you should have come over  for molly and curtis, guys, if you read this, its a year since we were sitting in your flat listening to you singing this- A YEAR.   This blog is dedicated to all my friends. I just sent this link to them, hence the many memories and remembrances. If I had one here, I would raise my glass to all of you, you little devils...

      Living at home still number 1 gripe. Number 2 gripe is not living somewhere else.  Apparently no one wants to employ me, or if they do quite fancy employing me, they can't quite be bothered to tell me yet. Either way, I'm nearly unemployed and nearly resigned to living here for the forseeable.   I am unstimulated and thus have nothing to say. I might stop blogging. I'n boring even myself.

      Oh, the remaining memories of Belgium. It's the music I'm really gonna miss...*   Today they played the Rasmus on radio 1 again, they've really jumped on that bloody song. To all of us who have been hearing it on repeat 'on the continent' since last May, it's wearing a little thin.  Monday it is. I am quite happy really, excited that primark will be open tomorrow for all my fashion needs. I'm off to have lunch in a beer garden somewhere in the wilds of Derbyshire this afternoon. This has caused a little worry in my heart though, cos what can you eat at a pub that is healthy wholesome and full of goodness? The cause of this worry? Well... I believe I have about a year to become the perfect size 10 for my brother's wedding, so I'm dieting, long haul. I have told my parents to do the same. We must not have photos to regret. We must look like we have healthy coats and wet noses. We must apply ourselves to this. (Message to Tatum- I can hear you sighing angrily all the way from the Moraes office. Darling- it's ok really!!! My love for durums will never fade... )  Another worry... Who's coming to my party? Are any of you?   Right off to give mum a slice of the computer action. How I want my own computer. Oh god, how I want them to get broadband.   Ciao belli. xxxxxxxx  * I'm lying. Also, I'm copying. I see that the asterix has become an integral part of the blogs of the people who inspired me to write one. So I have again jumped on the bandwagon. Just realised I wrote asterix not asterisk. See how I am so easily influenced by popular culture. The Torygraph had a point when they said that the youth were losing their intelligence due to bad spelling and txting- preesicelee.

      So back to less complicated matters... my fingernails are growing too long to allow me to type efficiently. This might finally be my step in to real girldom, the step I have been avoiding rather deftly for years. Perhaps I should invest in a nail file.   I just spoke to the lady Stevenson on the phone. I also received a  urlLink humping dog  in the post this morning. So that will be the party's in-house entertainment at my birthday party folks. Get ready to be utterly disgusted. And, well, humped.  Is anyone making me music?   Rules of conduct   1.dancing to cyndi lauper will not be tolerated 2.drinking softs will only be tolerated for a)drivers and b)the infirm 3.party dresses will be met with approval, party poppers will be gracefully accepted, party poopers will be SPAT UPON 4. 50 points for a kiss from the hostess.  5. 100 points for licking a man's face 6. 30 points for comic falling over 7. 20 points for most gullible comment of evening 8. 40 points for sweetcorn 9. 10 points for a dog hump 10. 8.5 points for drinking guin and ginness*   *Points can be translated into household must-haves such as longstemmed wine glasses or fluffy towel sets at any participating all night garage.

      I have been working very productively on databases of campaigning activity today (I am only really writing this to Dave, noone else cares, I am more than sure). It is good to be useful today, but I must say my new taskmaster has a tendency to flake, or flap, or fluster. He's very good, you understand, but his organisation lacks a little of the anality to which I am accustomed. Which stresses me out slightly.   But what the hell is it with Access? You put information in, in an order convenient to you, and it goes "haha, let me rearrange your fields so that the dates are no longer arranged as they should be, because I know better, being an inanimate object with no brain and no reasoning, and no actions other than those asked for by my master" which is me, you bastard, leave things well alone... so I made 22 databases of activity and then I went back to them and now they are not in order and totally bloody useless. And you know what. I will not do anything about it. That'll show this bloody stupid machine. (It won't though, will it, cos it's inanimate, and without a brain or reasoning or feelings to be hurt. I'm gonna lose this whatever I do. Bastard.)  Mint imperials today. Bloody marvellous. It reminds me of the pantomime, where we used to buy 10p bags of mint imperials in white paper bags to eat backstage between scenes. (I will never let it lie, Jonny, never.)  Tomorrow it is officially the weekend. I am going to do Eryl things and then I am going to do nothing. And then it will be Saturday and my birthday and I will see so many wonderful people and I might cry (it's my party, can if I want to) and be silly and dance and rejoice and be in love with the whole damn wide world. Brouhahahaha....

      So Bashir Khanbhai has been deselected, Kilroy is the face of UKIP and I have been given official work to do. The campaign is indeed afoot.   White chocolate buttons are a fine thing. In Woolworths you can buy 3 packs for 99p. In fact I bought a packet of buttons, a packet of moomoo milkshakes and a packet of teeth for that mild price. Sugar helps the world go round, and helps wash the tea down. I'm swimming in Tetley, longlive the queen.   I ventured into Watford proper for the first time today at lunch with our rather elderly but very sweet press officer. It is rather more impressive than I expected. I haven't seen the people of Watford in full force yet though, and perhaps that is where the town's weakness actually lies. Perhaps it is the scene of Bank Holiday carnage that you can witness in Derby on sunny May mondays. But there are nice shoe shops, a very spruce John Lewis... And all this on a tube line to London!  Really though, I suspect that all the scare stories were a grand conspiracy to make me think the worst, and one day when I leave work all the people in on the act will jump out from behind a lamp post and shout "Surprise". I of course will jump right out of my skin, with a peculiar quivering squeal that only I can perform.    What else can I say? Ah yes, to all of you coming to my party, please bring appropriate party music. My chief party music "responsable" (french accent) has pulled out. Wimp.

      I have a feeling I promised someone a title today, but I've clean forgotten what that was, so, you know who you are, this one's for you...  I have spent the day at my shredder, shredding electoral registers. It could be worse. Dave is at the CLP office in Bedford, and there is no internet access. In this era of information overload and instant communication, what kind of half-arsed, out-dated, old-fashioned, scared of modernisation, hiding from the real world, refusing to embrace life kind of organisation could possibly continue to function without the world wide web....? Yes, yes, you said it. The Labour Party. (Bedford branch, it's hardly a hotspot though is it).  I wonder whether I could be expelled for this kind of scandalous public gossip. But let's be real here. It's my two pounds a month that keep Tony in white shirts and coffee fixes. They couldn't afford to be without me. I AM AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE ELECTORAL MACHINE. I am the future. I am the voice of youth. I am I am I am.  Toast still buttered. But today, due to important dieting priorities, it's one slice buttered and one slice jammed. There is absolutely NO NEED to butter a jam slice and jam a butter slice. This is the crux of my dieting technique. That, and my mum's rule of thumb, "portion control". This is a technique akin to torture, where you make just enough of any dish to wet your appetite and not enough for your stomach to feel like it is being paid attention. The stomach acid is geared up ready for influx, and then sits there prodding at your stomach lining from the inside for the rest of the evening, unsatisfied and narky. The final prong (three-pronged approaches always make the best strategies) is eating loads of sweets. This also works as a mighty replacement for chocolate, cakes and biscuits. It rots your teeth, it gives you early onset diabetes, but so long as you burn lots of calories (ie run for a fortnight, or swim the channel), totally guilt free. I WILL NOT HAVE MY SYSTEM RIDICULED.   Do not try me on this one. Hunger pains make for grumpy ladies.

      Ciao bamini... in bikinis..  So here I am in the heart of the Eastern region, looking on the bright side. Watford, it seems, is at its worst sunny and at its best, not so bad after all. I am staying in a lovely little cottage in posh old Chorleywood which is on the tube line (just) and the owner, who I work with, is a lovely lady, very friendly, offering me wine and tea at all opportunities. Also coming up with job ideas, making interesting conversation, smiling. I am staying in the converted garage, which has everything I might ever need, down to aromatherapy shower gel in the shower and yellow ducks swimming along the bathroom window sill, cooking facilities should I ever need them (but the family seem pretty generous with the food so probably not necessary), a nice plump-pillowed guest bed...  This Watford office is funny, distinct lack of computers, phone lines and general office appliances for all those who need them, and the staff seem to have a few foibles I can appreciate. I am currently researching things I shouldn't need to research, but all the information has helpfully been thrown away. Dave, are you there? I need your help!!!   It is funny seeing the constituency side of Euro MEP life. It's a slower animal, more interrupted by party in-fighting and the usual national/local priorities overtaking things, more tea-fuelled, a bit wobbly on its feet. It makes our Brussels office seem like it was on speed (all those who witnessed the McNally Euro machine in Brussels will find that quite hilarious I imagine).   Today my contentment is such that I feel like my toast has been buttered and jammed, my tea made with fullcream milk, my bus open-topped on a breezy summers day, my shoes shiny patent leather and my buttons big round and chunky. None of these things true, of course.

      Getting worse and worse, about to start rocking backwards and forwards and muttering obscenities. There is nothing good. The weather is dreary. The train journey will be dreary. I have more than a sneaking suspicion that Watford will be dreary. Having fights with my parents, shirking all the things I need to do, clouds over my head.

      Oh, it's so early. When I said that happiness was waking up to sunshine (see right) I was being wildly optimistic, glass half full. Not having curtains is a true double edged sword. There is, in all fairness, something healthy, satisfying and cereal-advert glorious about waking up with the morning sun beating down on you. There is nothing worse than this happening at 6.45 am on a Saturday morning though.   It's like meeting the man of your dreams and then meeting his beautiful wife. Crap. A bit rubbish. Annoying at best. Maddening. Enough to make you want to pick up the radio and throw it at the wall in fury, safe in the knowledge that you are intellectually superior because you can actually define irony (see how thoughts breed into other ones, magically chasing down crazy synapse formations you didn't know were interlinked, at this time in the morning).  Soooo... I am launching a campaign. Bring back the womb. Bring back the dark, cocooned, far too warm, silent uterus-like state that sleep should be accompanied by. Black curtains, double lined for extra impermeability. 20 tog quilts (is anything else measured in togs?). Central heating, fluffy pyjamas,bedsocks. Sod SAD. Sod all this healthy living crap. I'm rooting for festering mornings in the sack, pyjama days, that pretending to be a sleep thing where if you do it for long enough you will probably go to sleep again even though its past midday and you should really be "making the most of it", dribledom, snorecity, sleep sleep sleep.   But now that I am awake... I am going to Brussels today. I have a busy 48 hours ahead of me. When we arrive (probably around 8pm, I'm estimating) here's my shopping list of stuff I must do:   dismantle a computer table pack up a kitchen  pack up my clothes clean the flat empty the cellar have dinner find dad his hotel room meet the delectable, Stevenson and others, drink heavily, possibly eat a durum sleep on my yoga mat, cocooned in sleeping bag and double quilt, curtains firmly drawn meet dad at 8am (so 12 hours for the above, yikes) take 10 heavy boxes, bags of clothes, computer, moniter, printer, stereo and speakers, 4 cd racks, double quilt and furniture down 4 flights of stairs without accident pack the car (cursing, blinding, ditching the excess in a trauma and strop) drive to the coast and catch a boat at 1.15 from Calais (so that's approx. 4 hours for the above hmmmm)  Arrive home in Derby without hitch, ready for parent conversations and heartbeat  Will we make it? Watch this space.... (I hope my dad is superdad)

      Today I toured Herts and Beds, hot on the campaign trail with the EuroLabour leader (none other than Mr Gary Titley himself, I know, his fame knows no bounds) and the Eastern region candidates. Pretty heady stuff. There was a lot of standing on draughty (drafty? hmmm...) street corners holding up helium canisters (cannisters? uh oh) and smiling like a freak. I wore a red rosette and felt a little like a Crufts dogowner must feel, and I handed out leaflets with typos in them. I doorknocked in places where everyone was evidently at work, making money they clearly didn't want to be taxed on and whose jaunty window displays of porcelain ladies in costume dress and period busts of mythical characters stank of conservative heartland. I got verbally abused a couple of times, but generally, physically and mentally intact, the day was a success.   Plus, now I will never ever need to revisit Hemel Hempstead, Luton, Caddington and the centre of Watford.  The weather has been satisyingly kooky. I've appreciated the grumpy looming grey clouds and the big fat raindrops. Could have done with a jumper on the trail though.  In other news, I have been wearing my pants inside out all day.

      Oh lord. First there was the hangover. Then there was the cringe factor. Now there is the general sorry state of this office, my work situation, my coworkers (pass me a chainsaw, i can make it better). I could do with a transplant, hole in the ground, general emergency exit.   While I am delighted in my new blog status (some spankin changes you might notice) and the joys of online publishing at large, it is comforting to discover that there are some things that do not warrant advertisement. I have secrets again. It's nice.   I went to  urlLink Londinium  yesterday evening, and spent a rather balmy (if flailing) evening drinking white whine(sic) on Marylebone high street. It was lovely, but I needed a  urlLink durum  cos frankly starvation+alcohol=embarassing situations and I really should know better. Dave and I reminisced about the good old days telling bad jokes and being geeky and Ben and I reminisced about the good old days when he was after Ali McLeod and I was the sad geek getting in the way of his footsie tactics. It's nice to be remembered fondly.   Today I feel wretched. but how good are dippy boiled eggs with salt and soldiers? Answer. Bloody marvellous. A good start to a bad day I feel. Must eat more.

      I used my trademark joke again today. It's been a while, but the comedy remains. Some things just never go out of fashion.   I am eating a rather marvellous king prawn sandwich as I type. I am also letting simmer new plans for a life plan, involving new courses to study, new job application tactics, and heeding the clairy fairy's kind if somwhat drunken advice. Which goes a little like this. I am not passionate enough. I have passion, but I react to it by being cold, unmoving, icy. I need to hump the leg of the things I really want in life. Ok, so maybe I just will.   (I'm not going to publicise my plans at this early stage though. It is truly tempting the hand of fate. If you say you're going to do something, you're kind of bound to feel guilty if you don't quite get round to it, stupid if you fail at it, fickle if you change your mind about it, pigeon-holed if you do succeed in it but then decide it's not what you thought it was...) This might of course be the kind of playsafe mentality which that minx of a fairy was alluding too. Damn. Fell at the first hurdle...   I am finally going down to London tonight to see how do-able it is to, well, do. I am going to meet Dave and Steve, and laugh at them about their embarassing drunkenness at my party. I am pleased and smug to note that my own particular brand of drunkenness was such that I remained reasonably together throughout the evening, continued to make sense and even at some points to have deep conversations about the psychological wellbeing of my friends and their partners, was agony aunt, mingler extraordinaire... I really was with it. The scary edge to that is that memory block has set in and frankly, much of the night, my wise words, my witty comments, my friendly chat, is in a trash folder deep in the depths of my brain. But nothing to take the piss out of. Feeling of superiority maintained.   Oh, also, remember my comments yesterday about Watford buses? Last night I got a bit lost getting home from work, and so the kind bus driver took his bus all the way to the bottom of my road just for me. Score.

      Today started in the most abrupt and offputting way with the scouring of someone else's grill pan. You might be thinking- ah c'mon now Anna, no need to overdramatise, a little bit of crusted on cheese and a few toast crumbs are hardly a reason to bring up last night's dinner or burden us with that whiny, grating, annoying voice you put on so well. But no, I protest, I'm not talking about a little bit of grill waste. I am talking industrial cooking fat. Firstly, there was the grill itself, caked in sausage relics, burnt on to the wire. Then there was the foil, upon which much sausage fat had fallen, combusted and lay dead, mourning its once runny life. But underneath the foil, oh a new world of fat repulsion. Thick, creamy white dripping, preserved in semi-liquid state by the protective armour of the bacofoil, emitting rancid old meat fat smells. I gagged. I gagged again. But what's a girl to do when she wants her toast of a morning? So out it came, was washed, dried and now sits happy, hygienic and well loved, where it belongs. Trauma I must say, but a sense of satisfaction reigns.   Never let me loose in a bookshop. Unfortunately my parents bought me three books I had already read for my birthday (bad communication... such a shame). So what did I do. I went in to return 3 books. I came out with 6. Count them, S-I-X. I get lured in by the quiet, reverent atmosphere. I get pulled towards them by their lush, matt covers and their prize-winning credentials. I got excited by the idea that beneath the clean edges and neat binding there lies a crumpled, dog-eared, well-loved story longing to get out. And I had to overdo it, yet again. 3 for 2, 6 for 4. Doesn't have quite the same ring now does it.   Watford buses suck ass. Watford might be the only place in Britain (correct me if I'm wrong, but I hope I'm not, it would be awful if great swathes of the country (is the country divisible into swathes?) were afflicted with the same disastrous public transport organisation) where the bus stops tend not to have bus numbers on them. Nor timetables. The buses tend to go on average once every three years, and tend not to finish the route. Little men in yellow illuminous jackets are pulling up the roads, and the buses have to change their routes, but see no reason to mark as much on the affected bus stops. To the poor, unwitting foreigner to Watford, bus-hopping is a minefield.  I had a bloody marvellous evening yesterday chatting to all of my friends on the telephunk. If birthdays are not for going out and getting atrociously trolley-bound, then they certainly are for celebrating the little and big things. This year, it was the beauty of being in a place where I can talk to my friends for as long as I want, about as little as possible, like over-hormonally-charged 15 year olds discussing spotty pubescent males they kinda wanna snog. Hazah! to that. I'm glad I'm home, I'm a lucky lass and Watford will not shake that out of me.

      Ok so I have to get this all off my chest now or else it will spoil things. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghhhhhhhhh. Huh. Whoooph.   It is so frustrating. I don't have internet access on my computer and everything I do involves waiting: waiting for a computer, waiting for the phoneline, waiting for the shittest ever webmail to get off its sorry ass and load the page. It's is ruining my cool. It really is.   Anyway, that aside... (not aside as in soliloquy, just aside, as in to the left of my inbox, placed neatly by my tea cup...)  Yes yes yes,  urlLink I am now 24 years old . It has taken me a while to get here (uh, like 24 years, dumass (no, not the writer of tales of epic swashbuckling, dumbass)) but now that I have attained this grand old age I am revelling in wiseness and agedness. Wiseness and agedness involves, I have today discovered, eating toblerone and requiring more salt and pepper than is provided on your egg and cucumber sandwich. It also involves a certain amount of earliness to work, and a tendency for sunny weather. No crisis about midway to 48 or anything has as yet descended upon my soul.   What is the verdict on staying in and watching telly on your birthday evening? Pretty sorry state of affairs I hear you shout. Hmmm. Any suggestions?

      speak quietly.  Why is it that when you are feeling frothy, nauseous and queasy, with phlegm dancing at the back of your throat and waves of repulsion surging through your body, you find yourself having conversations about alcohol, food and excess? Discussing the night before must be the worst thing to do. I have a headache in sympathy just writing about it, it's that bad.   I moved today. I am now staying in Woodside, north of watford. It seems very normal. Highlights involve double bed, big telly, no children, big bed. Lowlights include loneliness, dirty grillpan, not having met the houseowner, staying in this house on my birthday with nothing better to do.   What should I do with my time?

      Excitement, flailing, answerphone.   Today is the day of my  urlLink party . Today is the day of my  urlLink party . I must not sit down, I must not get nervous, I must buy frazzles.   So here are the  urlLink party highlights :   -punching my fairy friend square in the cheek, in a gesture of true love and affection -kicking my first party drink all over an (almost) stranger and ruining her pink shoes -electric light-up tulips (do not water) -the dog- it humped all it saw, it is now in the hands of a tall stranger and really needs to be returned -retro party fare (bacon frazzles, lemon bonbons, party rings, coconut snowballs, iced gems) -everyone loved the cheese straws, like, manically adored them -the two casualties who had to stop their respective taxis to throw up the bacon frazzles, lemon bonbons, party rings, coconut snowballs, iced gems and cheese straws, and the copious amounts of alcohol they ingested) -somewhere in deepest darkest london there is a homeless guy celebrating my 24 years -the 3 tarts who threw business cards through the window and crippled my fairy friend (bruise no.2) -those  urlLink scottish   urlLink imps  that I can now count amongst my friends -the flock of very tall things that entered late, raising the height average by a good foot -that there was a fight, that there was gossip, that there were hangovers aplenty -SAMBUCA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -everyone who turned up being wonderful and looking gorgeous and being mighty cool xxxxxxxxxxx  (any additions to this list of joy, do write in)

      ...drinking pimms, as it happens, with very interesting people, eating curry, later, with very daft waiters, arriving home, even later, in that staring-wildly death-glaze kind of a way. Lovely evening.   I am feeling slightly smaller, result of seeing big important things like national Parliaments yesterday. I am not smaller though, it's just that the world got bigger.   There are alot of things out there that I still must do and see and work at. It's a must kind of a day. Musty.   I am going to East Grinstead (on the edge of the world- you can actually look over the side and see the volcanic stuff underneath, and moles digging holes, and worms too) this evening to meet the bestest person this world ever sent me and, apparently, drink lemonade. I am jumping up and down in my seat excited, but holding it in. Which probably means that tonight I'll get overexcited like girls at parties eating too many jam and fishpaste sandwiches and bowls of jelly and I won't be able to sleep for sickness.  *guy next door coughs up a lung, and a fair bit of phlegm by the sound of it*  "that's disgusting"  What is it with these people.

      The best story I heard yesterday:   A colleague of the woman whose house is currently my home revealed to the woman whose house is currently my home that she is leading a double life. She is 50, has a husband and children and a home in Greater London, she works at the cop shop and she makes her family's dinner and does the housework like any normal person does. But she also has another man in Yorkshire, who she speaks to and text messages on a secret, second mobile phone that her family knows nothing about. Her mother is in a care home in Yorkshire, and every weekend she goes to visit and lives her second life with the second man. Man number 2 is her first love, childhood sweetheart, and she believes that they were "meant to be together".   I am quite struck by this story. I know that people have affairs all the time, that people cheat and play away and treat their families with no respect, or trade in for a younger model, or make a silly mistake during a rough patch... There is no mystery in infidelity anymore. It's a cheap trick, but it's also the usual run of things in quite a lot of cases. Now it's not so much whether someone has cheated, but the spirit in which it was done, the emotions at play, the character of cheater and cheatee that determine how we judge the offence. Nothing new there.   But what really fascinated me about this story is the secrecy involved. Can you imagine what it entails to really have secrets that you can't tell the people that mean the most to you, on a longterm basis? I don't know what it must be like to be able to get gratification and happiness that you can't show or share with anyone. I'm fascinated by it. Because normally, infidelity is all about negative emotions, guilt, revenge, jealousy, paranoia, unhappiness, dissatisfaction. But it seems to me that this woman is doing this because it actually fills a gap and it makes her happy. And she's pleased as punch that she finally got her man.  Weird.   Secretly, I'd quite like to know what it's like. I have two mobile phones, and two sim cards, two numbers. I could do this. The technology is at my disposal. IIf I could find two willing volunteers, I might try it...

      (not the endemol one, no)  Talking of which, does anyone know if Nice People is hitting french screens again this summer? My saviour in the hot steamy days of 2003, with no playmates and no money, I would like to think it gets another season.   I have a hangover. I am still suffering from the curtain thing, and lack sleep. I feel like a dog smells. I am cold (where did the sun go to?) and I am grouchy.   Did you know that google employs spiders to invade your computers and make nests there? Did you know that you can buy websites at the bank, and a man in America knows every website name in the world OFF BY HEART? Did you know that there is an accepted and unacceptable way of blog punctuation? True. The truth.   Two goldfish sitting on a perch. One turns to the other and says, "can you smell a parrot?"  Can I have an update on Kat and Alfie please? Did thingie go off with the young boy in Cutting It? Last night I made a grown man vow to download all the episodes of Dawsons Creek and watch them back to back. Power at my fingertips.

      A very strange thing has happened to me today. Everyone is talking about giants. In particular, giants wrapping people up in giant pittas and dipping them in pea and ham soup. I wish I had invented that myself.  Whiny travis on the radio. There's only so much Xfm you can put up with in one sitting. Not sure which is worse, this pappy crap or the pneumatic drill that has been keeping me entertained all morning. One of the workmen hollered at me on the way back from the sandwich shop. He wanted to know if I was really from the Labour Party. Political banter with the bastards that are drilling through my eardrums.   *she goes to find a cd* (I stole the asterisk stage direction thing from bloggod, it's quite clever, though I still feel like a common tief)  Shit. On the day of my party I organised my 2 cd packs into "vaguely cheery possible party music" cds and "definitely not unless you want mass suicide pacts upstairs in the ten bells and an unholy mess under the window" cds. It seems I bought the latter pack with me to work today. A grand old choice varying form Jeff Buckley to Nirvana to loads of other bands who wish they had the guts and the rock n roll credo to actually kill themselves rather than sing like they were about to. That's just bloody great that is.   *she plumps for beth orton*  You can see how poor the choice was. Oh for dirty homeboy rap with naked women and limited lyrical genius "I really need a wife at home, although there are a few I would like to bone"  I have been applying for jobs all day. Does anyone want to offer me one, so I can give up on this rather uninspiring activity? I am very good at raising office morale with a tuneful song, I like to tap my fingers from time to time, I'm good with foreign things... I'm persistent...  *she stops to have a very long phone conversation*  How weird! I've just been speaking to a girl called Isabelle from Rolf Linkohr MEP's office, and it turns out she knows everyone in the world!!! She asked about Jon and Wayne, she knows Alastair in Paris... marvellous. I love how small the world is. Plus, she has the best laugh in the world. A chuckle if ever I heard one.  Right, off to see a giant about a dog. Tschuss...

      In the hecticity and brevity of the weekend, my stepping back out into Brussels nightlife seems like a strange dream. It's odd to think that less than 48 hours ago I was sitting in a darkened Amour Fou (the VIP end, didn't seem very VIP though) on a wheely leather pouffe drinking thimblefuls of red whine with those longlost MEPfiends (yep, meant to do that). It was funny and I was happy. I drank a mighty amount of red whine for the occasion and felt rotten the day after. Which was not the crutch I needed for the packing hell which ensued. But guys, you guys!   Dave seems to be regretting being in the UK. The novelty has certainly not worn off for me, but there are a few things that Brussels does win on. In particular, I think I'm missing the woozy glory of beerdrinking (avoided now on calorie counts, and because of the preponderance of weak piss pretending to be beer in this country). The after work social life. Having people to hang out with. My own computer...    The UK still feels slow. Tea and sandwiches. Going out on the weekend. Buying toilet roll. Watching the BBC. I feel like going crazy. I feel the need to break out (scary when this type of vocabulary hits my brain. Next I'll be feeling the need to "kick back" or "rock someone's world"). Anyone for a knees up?

      My brain is like illuminous green silly putty, with added carpet fluff and household lint from one too many droppages.   It wouldn't all fit in the car.   I lost half a table during packing.  I lost half my will to live on the M1.   And tell me this. How is it at all interesting to drive in silence for 8 hours, 2 days straight? Surely a little light radio/cd entertainment wouldn't have gone a miss?   More later, when I can say things other than fklsr'jgiptogh j'gbklb;gjbgfiphdeio;m ,.pfiosjg io[etshjonvsdouf[qwfg'eg/s (pronounced "yikes")

      ... this was the beginning of a grand love story...  Once upon a time, in a land far far away, there lived a Princess called BoncefaceBird. She was very charming and had ringlets and legsuptohere and a very flat tummy and a winyouover smile. Her father was the King of all Verdi Spectacularus and was very very rich and loved by all his people. But though his men all loved him, they idolised his daughter, and waited impatiently for her to grow up, so that they could woo her on horseback with roses.   Princess BoncefaceBird was too sweet and innocent to notice this adoration and some in the land swore that she would never marry. But she lived a happy life, skipping and humming around the grounds of the castle, making friends with the grubs and the Frogs and the little green men who hid behind the shed and handed out sweeties to her whenever she passed.   Her father worshipped her and Princess BoncefaceBird wanted for nothing. But soon it was to be her 24th birthday and the King was growing nervous. The 24th birthday was of particular importance in Verdi Spectacularus, as it represented the passage into real grownupdom. It was tradition to receive enormous presents and to have a most fabulous party with many guests and retro party snacks.   The party was duly organised and many of the men of the land were on hand to help with the preparations. The present was another matter. Hard as he tried, the King could not think of anything to buy BoncefaceBird.   He summoned his most trusted advisor, Lord Wob of Which?, to help him, for he was good at all things gifty. "Lord Wob", he said, "Please help me, for I am in a desperate muddle. I need to find the best present in the world for my dear BoncefaceBird, who surely deserves it."  "Why yes," came the response from Lord Wob. It is true that BoncefaceBird is a fine young lady and deserves a wonderful present. And I think I have just the thing!"  "There is a New Big Thing that has taken the land's youth by storm sir. It is a computerised invention that allows you to write a diary and keep it forever, that all of your friends and family can read. It really is rather a marvellous idea. Wouldn't this be a wonderful gift? That way, she would remember her 24th birthday and every day after, and when she writes, she will always think of you..."  "Well!" declared the King. "That truly is a topnotch idea. Bring this gadget to me, for I think it is just the thing."  So Lord Wob trotted off and returned the next day with a beautiful computer, set up just right for BoncefaceBird.   The special day came, and the Princess entered her party in style, wearing just the latest fashions. All the men of the land had to look away, scared that they may be so stunned by the natural beauty of Princess BoncefaceBird that there mouths would fall wide open and display yellowing teeth and teabreath.   After the ceremony rituals had been got through, the King presented her with the computer. "Oh!!!!" cried BoncefaceBird, "this is truly the best present in the world!" And she threw her arms around the King in joyous thanks. She took herself off and with gusto began to catalogue her life, writing anything and everything that took her fancy.   One day, as she was writing her diary as usual, a strange box the likes of which she had never seen before flashed up on her screen.   "What ever could this be?" she cried, and clicked eagerly on the little clicky bit.   Inside was a message from a man called Anonymous. "Wow!" she exclaimed, for this meant that her diary must indeed be famous. She had heard of this man, and she knew he was very famous because she had read many of his books and poems. Could he really want to chat with her?   She decided it was worth taking a chance and taking seriously so she replied, stating how clever she thought he was, how versatile his writing style appeared to be, and, more worryingly, how very old he must be, given that some of the works of his that she had read dated back to a medieval time when people threw poo out of windows.   Anonymous agreed readily that he was rather brilliant, but admitted that in fact he came from a long line of Anonymice, and it was not him that had written works in the time of windowpoothrowing.   They struck up a beautiful friendship, and agreed to meet.   The rest is history. And predictable. Of course he fell in love with her. Well how could her resist? After all, this was the Princess BoncefaceBird, and she was very rich and very charming and the heir to the throne of Verdi Spectacularus. And she had ringlets and legsuptohere and a very flat tummy and a winyouover smile. They lived happily ever after.   The End.

Soooo... Questions at the ready please. My mind is empty of all those awkward things they ask you and I need to come up with some suitable answers.   Post me a question, you'll be aiding my chances of employment.   (And don't bother with the "perfectionist" one, I've got that covered)  Looking forward to hearing from you.

      Save me someone.   Right now I have one, among many, wishes that I feel like sharing. Here goes.   I wanna go to a big deep down and dirty hiphop club. I wanna listen to dirty rap and be all sweaty and feel horribly white and watch the boys and be ashamed of my impoverished looking jewellery and accessories. I wanna dance all silly and watch other people dancing proper and talk about the time I went to hiphop dance classes.   Can anyone help me with this?   I'm going to go to bed and listen to something melodic and do my stomach exercises, but I'm free next Friday...  Axxxxx

      *Starts with a groan*  Another bloody  urlLink grill pan  incident. Today, on opening the aforementioned, everything seemed to be in order. I popped my two slices of thick white upon the grillwire, tucked it neatly under the flame, and set about making my tea.   But then... disaster striked (always so tempted to revamp irregular past participles, so bloody hell, I will)... when I turned the toast over, there were little lines of grease running the length of my bread, soaked up from the invisible pig fat that had been lying in wait for me. And suddenly, I could hear the satisfying spit of secret bacon juices on the bottom of the tray, and the smell of it in my nostrils.   Bastard. You can't go away for a weekend without a grillpan fiasco ready to pounce on you in the hellish first hour of monday morning (Tuesday, yes, but Mondayish still).   Anyway, things have hardly got better since. I mean what self-respecting chirpy lady finds herself eagerly leafing through the last chapter of the Bell Jar before popping Jeff Buckley on the stereo to get dressed to? I feel like Becky Davies (although she had more Audrey Hepburn about her, in her day).   I'm not trying to do the melancholic thing, and actually I'm rather upbeat. I think it's just the effect of going home and feeling adolescent again that makes me do it.   Anyhow, the world is my personal plaything today, empty office, computer with internet all day. So all hail the joy of job applications, singing to myself and, should anyone be bored as me, receiving phone calls in the office. Long live Tuesday.

      I actually met one of the KLF on Friday night, so I'm thinking that east Grinstead is perhaps not, as I first thought, the edge of the world, but its very centre. This morning VK played them on the radio to remind me of their lyrical brilliance. Bring the beat bring the beat bring the beat back. KLF are gonna rock you.   Derby. Ugh.   I have lost all inspiration, all forward positive thinking, all incentive to be good and achieve and function functionally. Please, please let me get a job ad not come back here to live.   Sad Anna today. And no more typing, this keyboard's making my blood boil, and this internet connection has a virus and keeps sending me to Aunt Polly's sex den.

      Wherever I lay my enormous holdall and my little wheely suitcase, that's my home.   Today my home is moving to Chorleywood, where the grass is greener (presumably the pollen count higher too, *groans*) and the homes are lovely and welcoming. Yes, I'm jumping the good ship weightloss and I'm outy 5000.   I am summoning together a weekplan, which is reasonably hectic but seems to meet with most people's approval. It involves three days in the south, an interview, an aptitude test, a meeting with potential flattie, a shopping trip to the city, an evening as official "counting agent", a nervous wait as the results are read out and Kilroy Silk is elected to the European Parliament where he can wreak havoc on our broadcasting laws, a visit to the opening of my  urlLink brother 's exhibition, meeting up with my father and moving out of Chorleywood, driving to Brussels and moving out of Brussels, ending my phone contract, meeting my landlady and getting my deposit back, reassembling all of my things in Allestree, Derby.   I seem to have next weekend free though...  On to much more important things. Today is a vry special day. Today is the day that celebrates 21 years of the delectable Tatum being on this planet. Tatum, sweetie...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!   Have a wonderful day, it's all for you!   Let's all raise a glass to 21st birthday celebrations. May the drink flow freely!

      A slightly depressing night for the party faithful. Labour lost every seat they contested in Watford, UKIP won a councillor in my home town, and the governing party are third in a two horse race of an electoral system. So why am I feeling slightly relieved?  I'm not saying that I wanted Labour to get a trouncing. That would be a little silly seeing as how I am a believer in socialist ideals and my career path kind of depends on their success. But I am secretly a bit glad that they got what was coming to them. Not just because people are protesting and voting all over the shop and defying everything everyone tells them to do or not do, which is quite exciting. But more because I love to support the underdog.   I've always thought that the weak are so much more interesting than the strong. Modesty is so much more attractive than arrogance. Victims always get more sympathy than agressors. And rightly so. There is nothing attractive about men in big black suits swanning around with rakish arrogance and patronising the people with a soundbite and a quick handshake. Long live desperate people. Long live a good clean fight. Long live nailbiting finishes. It's what us Brits are best at.

I'm starting to think that this damn blog idea is one terrible mistake. It allows me to self-focus far more than is healthy. Time to scale down I think.   So for the record, I am very sorry.

      Droopy eyelids, prickling eyeballs, dripping nose, gakky mouth, fluffy head, numb face. I keep waking up with my nose juices leaking on to my pillow. I am horrid.  Hayfever is clearly a punishment from the allseeingallknowing.  Well to the allseeingallknowing I say this: Pick on someone your own size.   I feel rotten.   (PS. Did I tell you that at the weekend I successfully used the phrase "Made you look made you stare made you lose your underwear"? Kiddy Genius.)

      Eleven speculative applications on and I have officially had it with job applications. Eleven in a day! (This does not include the agency calling and the job website signups which would add a fair few more to the total) That has to be a record.   Still, new panic on the horizon (I'm so good at panic, maybe I should work at the panic station). I have been potentially cornered for some draftsperson work for the Department of Health, which sounds pretty handy for agency work, and it could be a six month contract, which would certainly take the pressure off...   "So there you are then, no more worry" I hear you cry.   "Ah yes, but it starts next week", I reply.  "And?"  "Well, how the devil am I going to find a place to live?"  Anyone know a good rental agency in London? Or an empty room?

      yeah, to all those who are COLOURBLIND.   Morning. It is bloody hot. Not just a little sweltering, we're talking Milton's festering Hell hot. I am feeling said heat in a rather unattractive way, with dripping kneebends and thighs sticking to leather chair. God help me if the fan breaks.   Sooo yeah. What was it I came on here to say? Ummmm. Ah yes. Why is it that potential employers don't keep promises? Now I have the vague annoyance of a decision not announced a day after schedule. But I know others (one in particular) who has been waiting a week and a half longer than she should have had to for a job offer or rejection. Who do these people think they are, playing on your nerves and your lifeplans like this? Do they think we are desperate? That we have no other choice but to wait until they see fit to move their sorry businessmaggotridden asses?   On a lighter note (although not that light, and frankly slightly mentally disturbing) did anyone see Easties last night? What the hell was going on with Martin and Sonia's script? Was it just on my tv screen that Martin told Son he was going to "dirty her up" before she offered to give him an all over massage? This of course, after the first alarm bells began to clang when the opening shot saw Sonia rubbing Martin's naked nipples? There is a reason why there is a watershed. It's so that the B-list celebrities that only make it into 7.30 soaps, who don't get the money to make themselves look sexy, lithe and pouty, to firm up their mantitties and faketan and GROW UP, do not get to do sex scenes. That is the law.   I feel violated.

Whether or not I have a job, that is where I'm going to go. I'm going to find a place to live and if I have to temp and then get a job well then I'll just damn well do it. Less of the panic. More of the doing.   Searching for:  a flattie  a place to live a job/temping agency but not:        divine inspiration  Final comment:  Can we have a REAL top 5 first dance at a wedding songs please. I feel I need to contribute to my brother's wedding plans. This would be very constructive. Suggestions on a postcard please.

      Those big holes, traditionally found at the end of the joke around Australia, will be found around Watford and its environs (I just found out that that is an Englsih word too, Charlotte Bronte used it. Brilliant) because I went to my soon-to-be mother in law's for dinner and I am now the size of a rather well-fed elephant. I can actually feel the skin stretching hulk style as I type.   Tip: there is no reason to be scared of stuffed vine leaves. Speaking as someone who was scared before, I can reassure all you worryworts out there that it's all fine. I understand that there is something ominous about biting into a little tightly wrapped package when you can't guarantee you'll get what you expect to get inside. I know that there is something a bit otherworldly about the green of the leaves. But seriously. No sliminess, no horrible taste, no cold rice. In fact, a delightful taste experience all round.   Can we strike out P Diddy and replace him with Michael Stipe? I am trying to picture a cross between Stipe and Henri. What do you get if you cross a premiership genius with va va voom and the most powerfully sexy, old, bald, looks like he's about to die from an awful incurable virus rockstar?  Hmmmm. Maybe I'll just take one or the other. Or both...  I'm exhausted. The candle has burnt down on either end so far there is no candle left. I need to tell you all about my trip to the big smoke to see the  urlLink Hopper exhibition . I also need to thoroughly explain my atrocious behaviour on Saturday night, my disgusting drunken me!me!me!ing when the delectable lady Tatum had come all that way to London to see me. I need to tell you about how I fell asleep on the train home and had to be woken by the train staff cos I had no idea we had got to the end of the line. I need to express worry at the fact that I had the shakes this morning from all that drinkin'.   But maybe not tonight. And anyway, apparently long posts bore some people. So I'm to bed.   Sing with me, children of the children of the revolution:  Train, whistle blowing, Out across the bay All bound for morning town  Many miles away...

      I am savouring my last weekend of freedom before I embark in stop 3 of my graduate capital trek. Back in the uck with all of my belongings (man I have so many bad but essential clothes, so many 4 year old items in my cosmetics bag I just might need when purple eyeshadow comes back in, so many pairs of shoes I'll never wear because my feet have never forgiven them since the last time, so many blimmin coathangers (there is a market for easy to pack tessalating hangers, should anyone be looking for an invention concept)). This weekend is pure mundanity, in all of its glory. I have been to the grocer's, I have done two loadsd of washing, I am looking forward to an afternoon of ironing. Nope, I actually am looking forward to it. It's cold, I'm looking forward to the steam.  I have a sort of lag from all that time on the road. It's making me feel anything other than sparkly.

      Did you hear that?   I got a job today. I got a job today.  For all you people that have heard me moan and curse, waffle endlessly about speculative applications and rejection letters, being poor and not having a place to live, the woes of Derby, the woes of Watford, the woes of every bleeding thing in the world, this is the pay off. You now get to be friends with the new, gainfully employed Kellygirl.   I would like to add at this juncture that though I tend to descend into self-pity far too often, I never REALLY think I've got it that bad.  And now that's over...  Hi, how the devil are you? It seems like a long time since I was here. Sooooo much has happened! Tell me all, do. (But do it fast, I'll be in Belgium tomorrow.)   In other news, Jules is an NQT. More and more reasons to celebrate!

      I feel like Ronan Keating. ('Heaven forfend!' I hear you cry.) Ok, so not exactly  like  him, but I can certainly  identify  with him. ('Worse!' I hear you cry. 'Get help!' I hear you cry.) I'm talking about the rollercoaster. Not the love one though, mine is a whole life one.  Actually, skip the Ronan references, yesterday wasn't just a rollercoaster, yesterday was Alton Towers.     The haunted house  I moved into my new room in my new residence yesterday. Subletting is a little bit freaky. Wherever I look, I am faced with another person's stuff, another person's dust, another person's music collection, computer, leopard-print sheets. I am haunted by him and his lifestyle (no television!) and I just really want to move somewhere I can call my own.    The black hole  Hackney is officially the blackhole of London. The Parisians, with their sensible policy that everyone should like within 0.5km of a metro station, would be horrified at the lack of understandable transport through this place. Ok, so there are buses. Have you ever tried to get your hands on a central london busmap? Ok, so there are about five railway stations in striking distance. You ever been in one after 8pm? Eery is an understatement. Deserted, unmanned, undercover- why wouldn't people abuse them? And the trains- its not the kind of service you'd get on the underground. When I first got the overground over to Cambridge Heath I had a drunken man kissing my hand within 5 minutes of boarding.  Yesterday I had an overwhelming feeling of being nowhere. Nowhere distinguishable from nowhere else, anyway. Black hole is a good way to describe it. I'm liking this extended metaphor thing.   The teacups  I was very english yesterday. I had a flapjack AND a buttered fruit scone for lunch. In between which I had an interview with MIND, the so very equal opps mental health charity that they don't even ask your name. This is ritual humiliation for someone who will always now be known to them as A Bird. The people working at MIND have the manner of a cup of tea- wet, soothing, full of purifying properties, and very very English.    The big dipper  Can I mention the F word? Oh, how the match wrung our hearts. Hands up who hates the Swiss? Hands up who nearly cried? Those two and three quarter hours are up there with the ones I spent watching Dancer in the Dark for emotional intensity. I came away shaking, no strength left in my legs- that fairground feeling.    The log flume  And then, well then it rained. I'm too cool to where a portable poncho so I got wet.   If it really had been Alton Towers, there would also have been candyfloss and doughnuts, tackshops and merrygorounds. I feel cheated. But as Ronan so rightly says, sometimes, you just got to ride it. (So did Janet, but that was in the context of packages, and I don't have to open the mail in my new job, so non applicable.)   PS. I now know why boys and girls should not see football matches together. Apologies abound.

      OK so I'm not going to be anywhere near a computer tomorrow so I get to post thrice without penalty. And I now have something to get off my chest.   What is it with girls' things and boys' things? Apparently, the football tomorrow is a boy thing. My social hookups are limited because, like everyone else, I want to watch the big match, but unlike half of those who do, I am not permitted because I do not have the swinging thing.   This is so unfair. Not only does it suck on the grounds of equality of the sexes, but also because the boys, those lucky privileged boys who are ALLOWED to watch the football, complain if we interrupt it, refuse to plan anything around it, and more importantly, are disgusted if we do not show any interest in it. I AM interested in it. But, contrary to all that, they don't want us to watch it. Well not with them anyway. Harrumph.    Trouble is, I'm not one of those girls that feels comfortable saying things like "Well who wants to sit around with smelly farting beerswilling neanderthals anyway, c'mon girls, let's drink some rosé wine and talk about the fashion status of fishnets and ugg boots". I like boys.   So damn you, I'll watch the football on my own. No boys, and no girls. Just you see if I care.

      Hey hey, well as you can see I am lacking professional inspiration. Apparently our job proper isn't going to start until 5th July. Until then, we are killing time, as the boss says "honing skills". Not an enormously convincing synonym for "twiddling thumbs".   The frustrating thing is that I still feel that I should be pretending to do stuff, that it's bad to spend work time (and remember I have to clock in and out and log my working hours for Kelly) surfing, blogging and emailing. Or applying for jobs. So six hours of the day I am eagleeyed, cursor loitering over the DH webpage, waiting for breaking NHS news. I don't think there is even such a facility on the site.   What I need is to be horribly horribly hungover, or daydreamy, or angry with someone, so that I could revel into staring into space and blocking brain activity. Can someone do something monstrous so that I can regain inspiration?   For all I am busy with resettling my life in a new place, I wish I had more news to report. It really is no good at all.

      That got you all looking didn't it?  Second day in the DH (the name has changed, they dropped the 'o') and I have been given a job to do. I am going to be 'embedded' and I quote, in SHASM, that is, the team responsible for correspondence on the subject of sexual health and substance misuse. Ha bloody ha, no smart comments about my sex life please.  Sooooo...yeah. There's not much more you can say about that really is there? I am now doing research to get me up to speed (I said stop with the witties!) and I'm feeling quite relieved to know where I will belong.   I went to see my soon to be abode last ngiht, it is rather lovely I must say. On the canal, and in what seems to be quite a spruce area of Hackney, if such a thing exists.  I am delighted with the football results (sorry, I'm still quite pleased that france is through too, I'm a traitor I realise). I have to admit that I was gassing like a girl during the England match and Hav and I managed to miss three goals one way or another. Spoons, the both of us.   London is being cruel to my bank account. Grrrrrrrr.

      I'm sneakily blogging on my first day in the Department of Health. I feel kind of naughty (but nice!).   It's all a bit squeaky-new, I've got that awkward first-dayer feeling and look gawky with it. I clumsily carry my bag, coat and tissues around with me wherever I go, I have that 'that's funny but I'm a little too cowed to laugh right now' inner chuckle going on, I feel like I'm eight years old and how awful would it be if I wet myself in class assembly?   Anyway, that aside, my transfer to London has been fairly smooth so far. My new "landladies" (my brother's lover, and her Mum) are very sweet. Very very sweet in fact. Doing no favours for the wedding diet though. I am off to see my new lodgings this evening (Hackney, where the mullets are at) so wish me luck.   It's incredible how little I am noticing the major football tournament that is currently gripping the nation. Maybe I'll try to dedicate a couple of hours to ketchupping tonight, but I fear I'll just want to sleep or daydream of cake instead.    Scientific fact of the day.   It costs the nation £16 million a week in petrol to fuel the extra drag effect caused by St George's flags flying on cars.

      Since I moved to London, I have not done very much. This is the best conclusion I can make of the past two weeks. My life was once a busy whirl and now it is not. My job was once productive, now it is not. But wait! There is more to my life than drinking and working, and for that I can honestly rejoice. Because since I moved to London, I have discovered a secret world. Squirreled away beneath the shirts and uniform jeans there are brains at work. The girls and boys of London are busy, fingers typing, ideas advanced. It's all very exciting. If this continues, I might just die happy.    Check out  urlLink the collective  for some of this ranting. It's anonymous because underneath it all writers tend to not like putting themselves out there. But mark my words, talent's afoot!

      Just to clear the air:   All note:  urlLink I am pleased to have a job  and I am well aware that I am lucky that I found a job that at least sounds as if it fits my general chosen field of work, even though so far it has involved thumb twiddling and filing.   Financially I don't feel that lucky: I have not yet been paid, so I suppose the initial excitement of having a job has worn off a little and the settling into the lifestyle bit has yet to come. (Still paying rent in London AND in Brussels and I got my last weekly wage slip back in the first week in June = POOR.)  All that aside, just having something is a huge relief, cos I know it's the crappest thing to be out of work and to feel desperate about it.   But more than all of that, I am sad that jobhunting has become such a difficult and depressing task that it creates ill-feeling amongst friends and an unhealthy atmosphere of competition, self preservation and self-doubt.   And more than that still: I am really sorry Dave, I didn't mean to offend you. xxx

      My top-of-the-class man-of-the-hour brother got a job yesterday. He will be gainfully employed as of Monday morning. One interview, one job offer. A teaching genius- let us raise our glasses in respect and celebration at this joyous occasion. Go him.  Employment eh. I've come to realise that it is a rather loose term, with far more pitfalls than you might imagine. I am "employed". I have an employer (the DH) and a contractor (Kelly) and I am paid for my time.  Employed  though, suggests use. I am not used, I am doing nothing during my "working" hours. So that, I suppose, officially makes me unemployed. Minefield.  And what about "gainfully employed"? Do I gain? Financially. Is my work gainful? Debatable, and anyway, it's not really "work". Ok, so let's concentrate on the earning side of things. "Waged"? I'm not actually on a wage, I'm on an hourly rate. Another minefield.   I hate these kinds of identity mindfucks. It's killing me, really it is.   Oh who gives a toss. Bring on payday.

(I'll never forgive Eddie for stealing the beginnings of all my sentences) I went to the  do , which turned out to be a New Statesman event (young political writer of the year- I want that to be me!) The wine flew, the canapes abounded, the schmoozing schmozzed. I left a short hour later, ridiculously happy, grinned all the way home on the bus. Oh, and at home. SO MUCH WINE. My body is awash. My brain is amush. But how lovely are my housemates?   Good cheer out of every ear. Today will be a good day.

      Can anyone explain to me the exact reasoning behind whistling? I have never been able to figure it out. It is tuneless, it is torture, it is unsatisfyingly pitiful in its range and volume. Why don't people lah instead? Bring back lahlahing. Much less surreptitious.   Well... The weekend was a bit of a washout (weather wise) and rather slow (lifewise). It started quite adventurously with a dash for Finsbury Park picking all the wrong means of transport- getting splashed at by contrary buses refusing to stop at DESIGNATED BUS STOPS, walking down long windy staircases (100 steps) to closed BR platforms, getting on tubes where derailments have caused mayhem (still pretty much hating this damn city). I then went bridesmaid dress shopping, which I think I enjoyed more than most participants. I am in my element in puffed out dresses. It's the Anne of Green Gables influence. THEN, well then I met someone and did some drinking, which was altogether odd, and then I found myself at home, wine-sodden, and it still not eleven o'clock at night. Peculiar.   Sunday was much more a write-off. There were good intentions, invitations, vague interest and general positive feelings but still, I never quite made it out of the house. I maintain that, had it not rained at the very point I was dressed and ready for the world (about 6pm) I would have ventured past the front door. As it stands, I endeavoured not to watch Cocktail and ate MORE wholewheat spaghetti. Three days in a row.   Today is going to be remarkably more productive. And less wholewheaty. And I am, no matter what it takes, going to shake that Ronan sponsorship from this sorry little site.   xxx

      I am slightly disturbed to note the rapid londonifying of my jackofalltrades accent. I need to darken my uh's, lengthen my consonants and stop the interrogative rise at the end of my sentences. Show some midlandian integrity for once.    Last night I went to see the  Ladykillers  at the Genesis in Bethnal Green. It was officially wacky wednesday, and everyone was in a popcorn frenzy. Sadly, I must admit to quite enjoying it even though Tom Hanks played the lead role. I hate that man and all he personifies. But he did a good job last night. Maybe he was having a good day. I heard he was terrible at the matinee and screwed up all his lines. Hah.   There are rumours of two important potential joys at DH, Skipton House, Elephant and Castle. The first, a very cheap gym in the basement. The second, very cheap fry-ups in the ground floor cafeteria. Not exactly complementary, I agree. Still, balance is everything in life.   I will no doubt be back later. Til then, let the day be fruitful.

      Oh the wind it is a-whistling around the corner of this office. Elephant and castle is a sad shade of grey. My mood has bellyflopped slightly out of pure spite- it might be due to the fierce tiredness that has come upon me. I am suffering from openplanitis- there's nothing quite like fifty people on the phone in a shared environment to raise the frustration levels. I need massage.

      I woke this morning with a curry and rice-bloated stomach and that not-again feeling. It wasn't  frustration or depression that did it, just the 7am automatic grumps. A shower and muesli and I was all to rights again, ready to face the world.   On my long train journey home from Birmingham on Monday morning I had bought a music magazine, a rare purchase for me. (If you don't buy them too often, the pomposity and plain arse that music journos write is less offensive.) This time I was foolishly drawn in by the headline- "Jeff Buckley lives"- even though I knew in my heart of hearts this was a cheap trick to win readers and JB was most definitely still in a watery grave.   Anyway, this particular edition has a feature called, uninventively,  Word of Mouth  in which writers, djs, band members and joe public are asked to name drop (terrible idea, allowing famous people to do that) their favourite films, music and books. I read this particular feature from start to finish on the no. 26 bus this morning.   Now tell me who had the bright idea of asking Andrew Motion his views on the popular arts? Tell me who thought it was a good idea to play to his fuckin undeserved poet laureate status and try to give him rock n roll credo? I'm sorry, but this man is pure unadulterated bollocks. Here are a few excerpts of that man's reviews, in order that you can understand my revulsion:   On films: "I love sitting there in the dark and saying "Do it to me!...[while] not being  showered with spit because you're not confronted with real personalities". Yep, truly a man of the people.   Then he rates Master and Commander ("Russell Crowe is brilliant") and a Kevin Costner film ( Open Range - has anyone heard of it? reviews please) Surely there are better candidates for favourite films out there than those?!   On music: he likens Jeff Buckley and Nick Drake to "the early 19th century romantic model...the young Coleridge, young Wordsworth, Keats and Shelley"- "a flash of brilliance...and then they gradually lose it and go off the boil, and then fall of their perch". Wait there's more: "...this decay is not inevitable. Did Hardy and Yeats go off the boil?  Au contraire !" I am not kidding, this man uses the Olly Garner classic with not even a shred of embarrasment. Disgust is oozing out of every one of my pores.   Oh, and then the sweeping generalisation: "As we all know there really hasn't been a decent pop song come out of France for the last 50 years".  Do  we all know that? Could he  be  any more condescending? How is he qualified to judge that? Fuckin' wanker.   On books: "All Alan's narrators are gay and you get a profound understanding of gayness". Ugh. The same man is "the best writer in the country today. If I din't know him as a friend I'd wish I did". Oh, so you are just helping a mate out with cheap publicity then? Or showing off the literary circles you move in?   How much can you hate one man you have never met? Sooooooooo much.

      Oh the marvel that is a private office campaign letter on the priority awarded to sexual health issues in the Government's health Plan!!! I am finally a working woman,  urlLink  gainfully employed  , and happier than a happy thing.   Yesterday I had my second curry in 2 days cooked by my own fair hand in the presence of the Hackney family and the wandering Mary, temporarily returned (if only in body) from her hardworking travels. It was a delight of an evening. I'm getting far too accustomed to this! Wine, chatter, good shouty hiphop and a feed of grand proportions. Excellence.   Slowly I can feel that London is becoming me, I am happier daily (and the work is a plus) and even the crappity of Elephant and Castle will not break my resolve now! Even I who thoroughly defended all of those "quartiers chauds" in Paris see Elephant as a carbunkle on London's rickety landscape. It's so ugly. For the Derbeians amongst us- it's like Duckworth Square. Ugh. The lunch possibilities are restrained compared to Waterloo, and the journey a little longer, the alarm clock a little earlier. Groan.   Tonight, if I ever get off this computer and leave, dammit, I am meeting Andrea for a drink in Westminster. I'm glad that you Bxl guys have all caught up with me today, perfect timing for this catchup! Curry (leftovers) for tea (3 in a row!) and I'm done and dusted. Be gone with me. To the city.   xxxxxxxxx

      I am happy (no relation to the title).  After a weekend of quiet fun and debauched, frivolous excess, many peopled and action packed, I am a new woman.   There once was a young lady called Anna She went to someone's house on friday and watched kill bill she helped her bro by a ring and got drunk in the evening and bought lots of dresses and had fun in birmingham on sunday.  I am now in Skipton house (Elephant and Castle, rubbish) working with the sexual health policy team. I am never going to get used to the word genital. I just can't.   Tonight I am cooking curry for the Hackney family and recovering from my busy weekend. I shall do it all with a smile on my face.

      I really feel that it is a wee bit cheeky to advertise a sandwich as avocado and bacon when in reality it is avocado and bacon bits, those grainy little things I got obsessed with working at Pizza Hut which are really made of soya and never saw a pig. I also think that sandwich-makers should be more rigorously interviewed before being employed. All this slapdash buttering and over-filling demonstrates a real lack of empathy with the unsuspecting customer, with his/her nice clean outfit and only-so-big belly.&nbsp; In the future, I would advise that the lunch emporia teach their workers to serve only what they themselves would eat. A little consideration if you please.  &nbsp; The important stuff out of the way, down to the inconsequential chit chat.  &nbsp; I am a truly secretive being. I am one of those teenage spirits who locks away their diaries (I don't actually write a diary, gave it up cos one day I did something I was too ashamed to write in it and then decided being honest with oneself was a terrible policy).&nbsp; I'm the kind to quickly minimise screens when the boss walks past, shield my blogs from people whilst they are in the making (and then publish them on the internet, not entirely logical), and blush when I have to give out my password to the techies (in fairness, it's a crap password&nbsp; and deserves embarrassment).&nbsp; I'm very jumpy, and being "caught" doing things that are, let's face it, hardly sinful is a constant fear. I'm the kind of girl that will not write a diary because that way, I can keep the secret even from myself.&nbsp; So if you come up&nbsp; the stairs and hear a drawer slam speedily, or enter a room and see a hand disappear under the desk or an arm cower over my papers, well, fear not. It's not you, as they say, it's me.  &nbsp; I often wonder what it must be like to have all that oozing self-confidence, front and general blazen-ness that other people seem to muster while I'm busy creating uninteresting secrets for myself. I can't imagine what it must be like to hand in a piece of homework, submit a piece of writing, present an idea&nbsp;and not feel like you've put yourself up for personal&nbsp;ridicule. How bizarre to think that there are people that leave their diaries strewn in their bedroom-muddle for anyone to see, for anyone to know even that they exist. But it doesn't matter where that confidence comes from. What matters is that these are the people that get on in life. They are the ones that dare.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Secrecy is a dangerous policy. It can hold you back. Imagine all the things you could achieve, relationships you could strike up if only you were not so secretive about what you wanted. The entertainment you could provide by sharing stories, the scandal you could create by sharing what you know. Openness and honesty are virtues that I have to admire in other people, incapable as I am of offering them myself. Still,&nbsp;at least I get to keep my failings well and truly under wraps.  &nbsp; I know something you don't know...! &nbsp;

      The househunting went rather well yesterday I must say. We visited two flats in N16. At the first, the landlord did not turn up at all. At the second, the flat was reasonable, but the area rattling. Still, Stamford Hill probably was not the best place to start. It is, I now know, MILES from anywhere, and the religious dedication quotient is off the scale. So we trotted down the street to neighbouring Stoke Newington, found inspiration and phone numbers, and have since edged closer and closer to Will Self's own Dulston. I am slightly scared of meeting my own Fats, but am willing to take the risk. Dalston is the place to be.   The odd thing abut moving is that the memories it conjurs are so old. I have flathunted a good few times now, but it is five whole years since I was trailing the shoddy streets of Oldfield Park in pursuit of the ideal student pad, five years since I hunted in the UK (wisely leaving the UK-resident Julia to pick Hardship House out for us in the 4th year).   There are all sorts of differences between househunting here and doing it abroad. Firstly, there are no dossiers of official papers involved. Secondly, a distinct lack of mathematical calculations of space in metres squared. Thirdly, a clear increase in said space in metres squared. I have not yet heard a whisper of deposit of three months rent in advance, plus agency month and first month upfront. There are plenty of other issues that seem to be springing up though- council tax is a looming horror. Check the water pressure, play with the shower. Check the heating situation.   I keep remembering the Bath househunting guide, with details of accredited landlords, checklists of questions to ask, forms to provide, repeated scare-stories about carbon monoxide poisoning and convection heaters. I seem to remember that my team of girls were very organised, and we followed the guide to the letter.   But the real pitfalls are much trickier. Everybody in Bath neglected to mention slugs, for example, although I don't know a student flat that didn't have them. Flood dangers were also a big issue. In Paris, sanitation was an issue- I really should have checked that toilet paper was allowed down the toilet before I signed the lease. In Brussels, the lack of a get-out clause on a year's rental agreement has caused me povdom for months now.   I have a feeling that I won't emerge unscathed this time either. I wonder what unexpected disaster is coming our way... Let's hope it's not an army of dead people chewing up and spitting their food into buckets, or eternal insomnia, or subtle sex.

      Not at all run down, I am chipper. So here's the rundown of the weekend's dalliances.   Friday was a washout, a cereal for tea, early to bed, hide under the quilts and pretend the day never happened kind of an evening. I was not incredibly proud of my behaviour, but sometimes, that's how the crumbs fall from the proverbial Maryland cookie. No chocolate chips for me that day.   Saturday was altogether brighter and more fulfilling. An early morning run along the canal to Viccy Park (you heard me right) readied me for a hectic afternoon on Oxford Street and Covent Garden cursing the lack of decent ponchos. Imagine. I bought the MOST KICKASS of shirts. Yes, green it is. It looks like a cartoon imitation of a shirt, and I have received (count them) 4 compliments on it already this morning. For saying only two people in the department talk to me, this is no mean feat. As a reward for Julia's and my toils, we gave in to our vices and drank cheap red wine in a familiar bar (hurrah for the beginnings of familiarity in my London life). The evening was spent no less deliciously, in a cheap and excellent and pretty restaurant on Farringdon Road (I thought that was an impossibility in this big city). An all-round success. Even Julia's legs creeping over in the night could not put a dampener on things.   Sunday was a bit grey and paranoid, grumpy, snappish and fitful. There was more shopping on Oxford Street (finally, the perfect poncho!) and a trip to Camden which was fun. Much tea drinking ensued, goodbyes to Julia and then finally, after much sullenness, a lovely dinner with wine and good chat, and all was righted in a jiffy.   Today sees the beginning of househunt week. Everybody's doing it, it's the in-thing. I already have Loot fatigue, but I am quietly confident.   Life is indeed a bowl of cherries.

      In the absence of love, carnal pleasures or hard drugs, what single thing could possibly do all of the following: send shivers up my spine, frighten me, make me grin inanely, remind me of the good stuff, get those muscles a-twitching, make me happy?   A compilation from that Bennett lad, that's what. Jonny, you made my journey to work delightful.   Thank you xxx.

      You may have noticed that I am currently visiting the fairy-god-motherland. It's something I've been none-too-discrete about, I admit. It's weird being on holiday. For the past week and a half work has passed so inoffensively that I have hardly noticed it, the fun of finding a flat to live in, going to weddings and having visitors has left me noticeably calm and smiley. So here I am, on holiday not really feeling the need for one, and the indulgence is bloody gorgeous.   After an initial day of wandering and rediscovering I have now thrown myself headlong into the real business of being in the capital. We have had a night of wine drinking in a bourgeois Charonne café, café au lait on the Canal St Martin, cheese-shopping and bread-shopping, a picnic in Villette and Barton Fink at the open-air cinema, eggy breakfast and a waterfight. Plus the listening to French people speak French, chasing bald men with scarves around with my eyes and watching the world go by.   Best of all, I've missed my friends and have found five days to just enjoy the company of people who tell me the truth. Gorgeous.  Only one thing in life stll troubles me:  Why is it that long-distance runners, sailors and endurance sports lovers all have lips the same colour as their skin? And freckles?

      Salut mes anges!   Today is a beautiful wonderful glorious day. It has shined sun for me, it has regaled me with responsibilities and workload and quenched me with tea and allsorts and hearty English goodness. There is the promise of&nbsp;good cheap red wine&nbsp;this evening, the delight of a long into-the-night heartpouring with the delectable Tatum, there is the certainty of memories flooding back and the possibility of a flasher or two in the Paris metro.   Ben oui! Because tonight, I am going on holiday. I am going to Paris, to see the sights and eat the cheese and wander around aimless and happy, the way it should be.   Life is indeed a piece of cherry pie. A  tarte aux cerises , if you will.

      Had a tipsy silly evening with my housemates last night. I told all my jokes and I even got a few laughs. I got more laughs when I was trying to be serious. I don't think that's the way it's supposed to be.  &nbsp; Did I tell you about the weekend? Did I? I didn't? Well it seems a little late to be delving into it now, so it'll have to be the highlights I'm afraid.&nbsp;They included stolen coconuts, freely offered sticks of rock, a helicopter&nbsp;&nbsp;and some true Saturday night&nbsp;fever. Champagne and scampi, my new favourite combination. Oh, and then there was a Michael Moore rant, a bowl of spaghetti con gamberetti and the three (+3) reasons I enjoyed my final year at university, all in one room.    Three good reasons to be a carpenter    1. your house will never fall down  2. you get to pretend to be Joseph  3.  urlLink toolbelts  &nbsp; Tomorrow I am going to Paris. Pull on your beret, spray on the garlic odour and reach for the cheese knife, cos tomorrow I'm going all French.

      Now, you might have heard  urlLink the legend of Boncefacebird  before. It is a story that has been told and retold to generations of infants dangling on their grandparents'&nbsp; nobbly knees. But no matter the epic quality of the tale, the facts were not exactly straight in the first telling. I feel that it is perhaps time to come clean and tell the real story of Bonceface- the truth behind the legend. Plump up your cushions, make a cup of tea and I shall begin.  &nbsp; First of all,&nbsp;Boncefacebird was not a princess. She was a sweet little kid, a bit vicious when intimidated, a bit self-obsessed from time to time, certainly not royal stock. Her legs really only went up to there, and her smile- well no, to be fair, her smile was pretty cool. Anyway, Boncefacebird grew up in a pretty typical kind of a house, in a pretty typical kind of a street, in a middle England suburb where the grass grew til Sunday when the lawnmowers came out to play and where four kids outside the chippy on a Saturday night would cause the local media to stir. Bonceface kept quiet. She had friends and she had books and she had dreams. She didn't really have a queue of suitors biding their time, horses saddled. That bit was pure invention.  &nbsp; Bonceface always wanted to travel, and from an early age&nbsp; she pestered her parents (they weren't royal either, although they were lovely as the crown jewels to her) with imagined voyages across the sea. In her mind, Bonceface was an intrepid reporter in Paris, an international businesswoman wearing a neckscarf and boarding a plane in Rome, or a&nbsp;Euro-&nbsp;translator fluent in seven different languages and wowing people in all seven in Brussels. Her dreams were ambitious ones, but then there's a lot of dreaming time to be had in a middle England suburb when you're not in the chipshop gang. It wasn't really her fault that the stories ran away with themselves a little bit. &nbsp; So it made sense for Bonceface to go to university and study languages. It made sense for her to leave her home town, her home country, her friends and her family and try her luck overseas. It was a passport to something different, I suppose, a search for excitement and stimulation she had not yet found. Well that was the idea. Of course, ideas tend not to translate everso naturally into reality. Excitement and stimulation? Plain hard work more like.  &nbsp; Bonceface went to Paris. No one can deny the beauty of the French capital, and Bonceface was blown away by the impressive skyline, the streets oozing with history and national pride and all that "je ne sais quoi" that people always drop knowingly into their Paris stories. Yep, Paris was beautiful. And as for wonderful experiences-&nbsp;&nbsp;her glasses&nbsp; were stolen from her in the metro, an unknown agressor punched her in the face on her way to buy a shelving unit, she was stalked by her next door neighbour, she was verbally warned time and time again about those chunky thighs and that nice round bottom of hers.  &nbsp; Bonceface went to Rome. She saw the mighty Roman ruins, devoured the Renaissance artistic brilliance, drank Chianti and ate arrabiata with a thrill. Italian people are wonderful? She was mistaken for a drunken depressive's daughter, fed cheesy peas and encountered more male (and sometimes female) nudity than one poor suburban innocent really need ever see. &nbsp; Bonceface went to Brussels. She learnt about the real way to brew a beer, the right way to pour it, the best way to drink it (straight after work, with nuts, two for one being best of all). She browsed the Christmas markets and engaged enthusiastically in Europhilia. Brussels a vibrant Eurocapital full of opportunity? She was swindled out of her money, left for days without heating in the dead of winter, made to eat fish with custard.  &nbsp; Well, there was only one thing for it. Bonceface just had to go home. All of her dreams lay in tatters around her feet and her pretty cool smile had lost its lustre. So she packed up her belongings, sold her furniture and her plants, gave away her spice collection, and jumped on a train home. Home? Don't be daft. Bonceface was disillusioned, not stupid. Suburban life was still not her bag. She went to London.  &nbsp; And so it&nbsp;is that the legend that was Bonceface never did settle down in Verdi Spectacularis, daughter of a King, wife of a talented author of timeless classics. Bonceface instead disappeared into the neverending sea of people that live in England's capital, and set up a life for herself there. She continued to dream, but tended not to act on it that often.  &nbsp; That's not to say that she gave up on life. She was quite content actually. She got used to her legs justuptothere, dealt with the chunky thighs thing, and found some lovely people in all sorts of extraordinary places that made her laugh and cry and giggle uncontrollably.  &nbsp; The moral of the story? Oh, probably something about dreaming being the important bit I suppose. Love story? I expect there'll be a few of those too.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       6. July 27, 2004 Correspondence team bowling night at Elephant and Castle bowling alley    &nbsp; From the off, the primary colour-swirled carpet, the thumping house soundtrack, the "keep your own shoes" policy never suggested a class night out. I was tired from my eurostar-commuter lifestyle of a day and  urlLink bluesy  with it. So I suppose what ensued was only the inevitable. I drank more than was strictly necessary and ate nothing at all. Cowed by all the new faces I turned into "flippant-cocky-damn-bloody-offensive-anna" and treated everyone with contempt they didn't deserve. Cos frankly, they are all rather nice after all and I was a drunken disaster area. My bowling was erratic to say the least, but I pulled in a few strikes. And every man was fair game for my personal brand of flirting (being irritating and aggressive). Oh dear. Oh dear dear dear.   I learned yesterday that I have been given the prefix "bad" due to assumed skulking one friday afternoon (it never happened). Baaaad Anna. Sadly, last night did everything to make sure that the name is going to stick.

       1. August 1996- August 1998, the Derby Pizza Hut years   for, most memorably, having the gay kitchen boys whisper "genital" and other filth into the ears of impressionable teenagers (which, to be honest, we quite enjoyed and rather encouraged). also for 30+ year old managers hitting on the waitresses (not encouraged so much) and for having to eat at the Harvester (should be against the law). drinking scores of bacardi shots with a girl known as "dirty ang" and my parents sending out a search party.    2. December 1998, the Bath branch Pizza Hut Christmas Party   arriving at a friday morning italian politics lecture steeped in too-fresh alcohol odour and refusing the 3pm bacon sandwich on account of waves of nausea. for reasserting the universal truth- there is never a need to pour tequila into a pint of beer, much less need to drink the result.    3. August 1999, the Tonic painting party   when Gary (Hi, Gary, Tonic) decided to paint the staffroom in an allnight "painting party", alarm bells should have rung. Instead, I signed up and provided&nbsp;plenty of excuses for the Brandygirls to continue their bullying by&nbsp;&nbsp;disappearing off to find chips with the washerupper (as good a reason as any) and doing inappropriate things with the Sardinian sous-chef.    4. October 2003, lecteurs teambuilding night out   the idea behind a teambuilding session is surely to find out interesting and new things about your colleagues and break the ice. On this particular occasion, the ice never broke. But I did learn to dislike all of the people I was doomed to spend the next nine months with. On reflection it might have been an idea not to go.    5. April 2004, McNally office staff training day in Lille, European city of culture.   ok, so no drunken&nbsp;antics here. But TeamMcNally events tended to involve plenty of opportunities for me to show myself up and demonstrate a startling lack of etiquette. Including throwing food, ordering plates of undressed lettuce as a main course,&nbsp; and being hit on by Eurostar "employees" in front of the Eminent Personality herself.

      It's a cruel life, being torn bodily from the greatness and deliciosity of Parisian life with only the promise of an evening bowling at the Elephant and Castle bowling alley to look forward to this evening. Twelve hours ago I was still groaning from too much food, too much wine, too much good company, too little time left. Now, my holiday has gone the way of all holidays- to dreamland, like a particularly vivid flight of imagination. I hate saying goodbyes.   And now I'm back at work. I am suffering from return-to-the-grindstone blues. Worse than that, I have been handed an ominous&nbsp;package by a rather revolting guy in the office which, according to all accounts, is likely to make me physically sick. It is a number of photos of abortions, I believe, but I have so far refused to open the flap and take a peek.   The envelope has been sitting on my desk all morning. I have twice likened it to the special delivery cardboard box containing Gwyneth Paltrow's severed head- we all know what's in there, we're all poised ready for the repulsion as Brad (or was it Morgan?) opens the box...&nbsp; Really, I should be likening it to the box of Charlie Meadow's possessions that Barton Fink sits quietly by his typewriter- a strange muse for his wrestling film.* I have a feeling that I too will not choose to open the box. Well not today anyway. Pray for a stronger stomach tomorrow.   You'd think my stomach would have hardened after yesterday's trip to see the Francis Bacon exhibition at the Musée Maillol. Bacon, that's one disturbed puppy, if ever I saw the work of one. More disturbing still his own assertion that he is interested in beauty- hard to see how beautiful a deranged, distorted pope with skeleton teeth can be.  On a lighter note, I really need to learn to touchtype.&nbsp; I keep hitting the wrong keys with my flailing fingers and inadvertently signing my name "abba". Even worse, sometimes it comes out "Abba Nird".&nbsp; It can't be doing my reputation any good at all...  And finally, I just stapled my fingers, and now there is blood all over the keyboard. Horrid, Horrid Day.   *Yep, this&nbsp; is  a deliberate attempt to record the details of the film I went to see on Friday night, lest I forget and get&nbsp;laughed at again for my  urlLink shoddy memory .

      I have never been much of a sportswoman. Ok, so I used to be on the school hockey team but I tended to be made Left Back and stood freezing at the edge of the opposition's shooting circle contemplating the ugliness of mouth guards and cycling shorts under netball skirts. My ballet teacher expressed amazement at how uncoordinated a seemingly clever little girl could be, I was scared of leaving the ground in acrobatics and was resigned to forward rolls and a headstand or two. I despised the bitchiness of netball and I always chose discus on sports day.   So it was very much to my surprise yesterday when I emerged the victor in our post-ciné game of pétanque. Not only did Yoos and I win, we beat the sissies 14-4. Now that I am officially "sporty", I will have to adopt the vernacular. Expect endless clichés and nasty utterings about how much the girls "are gonna get it" any time soon.   And now for a recommendation. If you can find it at a cinema near you, go and see  Fond Kiss , the new Ken Loach movie. Put all the Respect fiasco to the back of your minds, I'm positive he never  really  liked George Galloway. If there is one thing that bowled me over in our four sorry years at Bath university, it was the speech Loach gave on our graduation day. I don't know how he does it, but that fine old socialist has a genius touch when it comes to saying it like it is. More importantly, this new film features some of the sexiest sex scenes I have seen in a while. Reeeespect.

       Over the wine last night:   Apparently, it is not normal to not remember anything about the plot of a film you love and class as a favourite, or a book that you cherish. It is weird, apparently, to not remember that there were actual Russians in the Big Lebowski. I'm starting to think that my head is just a big black hole.   Still, I can read a line of text in three jumps. Which is less than most.    Midnight words of wisdom from a source close to my heart:   Southern boys are cheeky, lovely but  know what they're doing .  Northern boys are just nice.   I can't bring this to any kind of logical conclusion. But I expect it's true.   And the wine keeps on flowing...

      It is hot and it is raining. Fat summer raindrops the size of eyeballs and bath pearls splatter commuters and pockmark the pavement. I am on my way to work. I consider what-shall-there-be-for-dinner-tonight, the state of my finances and my frown in the bus window. The rain becomes more determined, slashes the window and darkens the sky. I consider skin conditions and new washing powder brands. The dark-haired, checked-shirted boy sitting next to me twitches his leg nervously. I muse on where to buy shelves. A couple behind me witter about barbecue sauce and chicken grease. I think about flamingos and the mighty pinking-power of prawns. The teenager in front is discussing babies’ names from a newly-bought book with someone ( the father? Is she pregnant? ) on her mobile phone. I consider Roman ruins and how pubs get their names. A man in a cap saunters up the stairs and slots himself next to a suited businessman on the front seat, oozing body odour and stale weed. I picture a love scene, an embrace, a release. The girl across the aisle has biguglytoes and loose skin around her toenails. I think about cups of tea, cups of tea, cups of tea. The bus lurches to an untidy halt an inch from the no. 38 in front. I think about monkey-dung and giggling. A woman with a blonde baby girl in a push chair struggles to keep her footing as the bus pulls out into the traffic again. I pull out my book, consider the yellow flowers on the front, put it away again. A man in a leather jacket, newspaper in backpocket, starts to argue with a professional-looking woman standing by the door about pushing and not apologising. I shut my eyes and will it to be night.  None of this is interesting. None of this is newsworthy. None of this is worth your time.
