      Dear Family and Friends, I am making this Blog for you. I will post photos of what I have been doing recently and maybe not so recently....and try to update it often. I am gaining more knowlege on the use of my web cam and hopt to be able to entertain you and keep closer to you by way of the web instead of sending you cumbersome downloads. Love, Jenn

       urlLink    Ketchen took me for my birthday lunch to a place called The Hard Wok....There was a pan of these....under the warmer...they are peach shaped bean curd dumplings....sort of ick..though I brought this one home and Jayden ate it...I could only get through half of one at the restaurant. Like a boiled dumpling on the outside, I don't know how they shaped it like a peach...but on the inside, dark brown bean curd paste.....very bizzare...like refried beans with lots of sugar....interesting.... It is this year's birthday cake....&nbsp; urlLink

      As I look at my posting so far this week it occurs to me that Michael is doing things and the rest of us are just laying around at J-East. Randy's house. We do things too...but the camera is always near when I am by those I love...and weekends are full of that...Randy makes it easy for us to hang around and relax. The Seymour Amish countryside makes it easy to forget the world of working folks and just hang around doing silly things... This week I have been more focused in the arts...I think when school starts I always feel the urge to buy pens and tablets, backpacks and new shoes....This week Jayden and I splurged and bought not just necessities but a few sketch pads, charcoal pencils, colored pencils, paint brushes etc...we are having a fun time sketching things that make us laugh...and as you have seen, my art can be laughable....frankly I have been miserable about drawing eyes which have been a particular interest to me recently in photography...perhaps I'll pay more attention to noses and mouths next....or even funnier...maybe bellies....of course most of you are guessing who the bellies belong to....LOL...but that last one? It belongs to Santa Claus.....yes, Santa....could you see the beard? In real life, Shannon's Dad, Art. Thanks Art for the Artful belly shot!  Next week my neighbor Abby will be staying with us...so expect more delightful photos of her bronzed face and happy smile.... I heard from Sage yesterday...enjoying his trip to Oregon with his Dad....looking forward to his return next week.... Erin and Jack will spend another week with Randy, which smells of creek trips, crawdad catching and Jack's 9th birthday..... Painting Randy's bedroom is up for consideration in the comming weeks...it is a sky blue now...I am thinking of topping it with a white glaze in a cloudy/foggy finish.... I bought a new paint book today at Lowes....anyone have a blank wall that they'll let me work on? I am dying to try the brick look and also the marble finishes.... If you're following my blog...I'd love to hear from you....feel free to join and post a comment or just send me an email.....thanks for stopping by, Jenn

      Goodmorning....for now all I have is words....Today K is leaving for Tennesee and will be gone for maybe 4 days so I will look after Goldie and her 10 golden retriever pups. They are in K's garrage. Sage and Jayden just left to swim in K's pool.   I still did not get photos of the bathroom at J-East. I have the list of supplies and costs and it is a good list.... I'll start by saying that this bathroom was the color of a plastic mustard bottle...I look bad in yellow anyway..(haha) but there was something unsettling about the color...there are no before photos...sorry...I could have been much more efficient with cost here...but it was the first room at Randy's that I started and I am still not very done yet...  There was plastic panneling about 4 feet high around three walls. It was originally white but was all painted mustard yellow. When I realized that it would come off and still leave sheet rock on the wall, I immediately set to work ripping it down. I don't know why it was so horribly offensive to me.  I bought a bucket of spackle at Walmart for $6 Gallon White Paint--Habitat for Humanity $2 Opposing stripe-gallon-Habitat           $1 Not bad so far...I needed to caulk around the shower and sink and had caulk leftover from a previous job so $0 You saw the picture titled unusual art....that is the old picture that was already there, I painted the frame the contrast color...and turned the picture around...glued some black and white beach prints and a sand dollar and three small star fish on the white picture backing and threw it all back into the frame for $0 on a 5 AM sleepless night.... So far I am into this job for $9 Then I splurge on a $5 oak towel bar and a $1 tp holder at Habitat. Finally I go back and get the molding....a bundle at Habitat...including the chair rail molding for the living room...this came to $2. Wow! Overbudget...my ten dollar bathroom remodel job is now up to $17.... I did buy myself a new mitre box at walmart to cut the molding but I needed one for possibly making easy photo frames and some molding work at my house....Randy and I each had mitre boxes but neither of us had the correct saw...this time I plan to keep them together.... The bathroom is stark white and has two stripes...the contrast stripe color was used for the picture frame, and for a table that is now being used as a bench in the dining room...and possibly will paint the dining room table top as well...I have also used this color to paint a shelf that I found in the closet there and intend to hang someplace as decorating progresses.... I am having so much fun with this...I am sure that the details bore you. And a question for Bill....Mitre Box with saw $9 same saw alone $11....what's with that? It's like they are paying me to get a new mitre box....LOL....

      I have tried to photo cronicle the changes I've made at Randy's. He has cable TV and I have been watching some of the home shows there which have made me want to photograph the changes made to the house and keep a running tab on how much money the entire thing is costing. I can't believe it when I watch these shows and they spend $1,000 decorating each room on shows such as Trading Spaces etc. I have been more interested in Design on a Dime etc.  I have kept track of the expenses and the places I've found much of the things used in this project and hope that the details are not a bore to you. So far the costs have been minimal for the living room, hallway and kitchen areas...Randy buying the paint and me shelling out only $15.45 for the accessories for the living room and including the $1.45 piece of material that I used to recover my old barstools with which you cannot see in the kitchen photos yet...I am going back out there tonight and will try to provide photos of that area soon.  Comming soon will be pictures of the dining area and the bathroom which have been a bit more costly and thought provoking...but neither of those areas are complete yet.  Thanks for following

       urlLink    Randy's old living room...the antique mirror on the far wall is hung low...I raised it three inches and took away much of the furniture and odds and ends. Randy scored a new couch and loveseat from a buddy for a bottle of Jack Daniels! Making this room renovation completely possible!&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This shot of Randy's fireplace shows that at this point it is a work in progress. On the mantle now instead of slumping frameless photos are his muzzle loader (gun) and hand made bow that will soon be hanging along with some outdoor pictures taken from another wall. Everything in it's place..even his rock and bone collection is contained in a basket, leaving extra seating on pillows in front of the fireplace which rarely has a fire. The wooden and leather chair in front of the fish tank and the coffee table are the only things that stayed from the last arrangement. See how light and bright my cheap curtains look? Beautiful....and the chihuahua's box bed under the leather chair....ha ha&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    A view of Randy's living room much as it is today...I found the ores in his shed and they worked with the nautical theme of the couch fabric. The coffee table was beautiful but hard to see earlier. The plant is something I scavanged from the yard and also the pot that it is in...The new curtains cost about $4. This room is painted with Antique White Satin from Wal-Mart and Randy purchased 3 cans costing approx. $30. The molding on the far wall was thrown into a bundle of molding I purchased for the bathroom so $0. and hooks were purchased from Lowe's for the far wall for hats and jackets at the molding line $10.&nbsp; urlLink

It is durable and the paint store told me it would hold up on a boat dock! It made the porch railings look great....As the paint was just becoming useless in my garage...the cost for this renovation was FREE!!! Though a bit of sweat equity was involved...and a few popsicles. I'd like to paint the rest of the deck to match in the future.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    There is much Amish traffic past Randy's house as he lives in an area with many Amish neighbors...This is a picture of an Amish house. You can see the buggy parked out front with the orange triangle on the back that is manditory safety precaution these days...nothing else fancy, no electrical lines, no flowers, no garden...there was some laundry hanging on the porch but it does not really come out in the photo....&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    An Amish couple. I don't know what they were doing...it looked like the man was just shaking out his legs....or possibly training the horses to just stop and be good...&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This tiny green thing in the water is green with red spots...it is long and slippery. Randy tells me it is a leach. It certainly is interesting....I'd like to know more about these things...they seemed to be about 5 inches long.....&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    A few weeks ago I posted Catulpa worms on leaves...this is what is happening to the worms. They are covered with these tiny cotton type things and the things are hatching more worms...this seems to take alot out of the main host worms...there are also worms that appear bigger and have no eggs...I wonder if they are egg layers....interesting....&nbsp; urlLink
