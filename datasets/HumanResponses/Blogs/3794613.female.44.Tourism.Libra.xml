      This is a plan that was suppose to bring down the gas prices, and it has not worked. I sent out many copies of this e-mail to many people but it not working so I guess it has a glitch. 2004 GASOLINE PRICES I hear we are going to hit close to $3.00 a gallon by the summer.  Want gasoline prices to come down? We need to take some intelligent, united  action. Phillip Hollsworth, offered this good idea: This makes MUCH MORE  SENSE than the "don't buy gas on a certain day" campaign that was going  around last April or May! The oil companies just laughed at that because  they knew we wouldn't continue to "hurt" ourselves by refusing to buy gas.  It was more of an inconvenience to us than it was a problem for them.  BUT,whoever thought of this idea, has come up with a plan that can really  work.  Please read it and join with us .By now you're probably thinking gasoline  priced at about $1.50 is super cheap. Me too! It is currently $1.97 for  regular unleaded in my town Now that the oil companies and the OPEC nations  have conditioned us to think that the cost of a gallon o f gas is CHEAP at  $1.50- $1.75, we need to take aggressive action to teach them that BUYERS  control the marketplace....Not sellers. With the price of gasoline going up  more each day, we consumers need to take action. The only way we are going  to see the price of gas come down is if we hit someone in the pocketbook by  not purchasing their gas! And we can do that WITHOUT hurting ourselves.  How? Since we all rely on our cars, we can't just stop buying gas. But we  CAN have an impact on gas prices if we all act together to force a price  war. Here's the idea: For the rest of this year, DON'T purchase ANY  gasoline from the two biggest companies (which now are one), EXXON and  MOBIL. If they are not selling any gas, they will be inclined to reduce  their prices. If they reduce their prices, the other companies will have to  follow suit. But to have an impact, we need to reach literally millions of  Exxon and Mobil gas buyers. It's really simple to do!! Now, don't wimp out  on me at this point...Keep reading and I'll explain how simple it is to  reach millions of people I am sending this note to about thirty people. If  each of you send it to at least ten more (30 x 10 = 300) .. And those 300  send it to at least ten more (300 x 10 = 3,000)...And so on, by the time  the message reaches the sixth generation of people, we will have reached  over THREE MILLION consumers! If those three million get excited and pass  this on to ten friends each, then 30 million people will have been  contacted! If it goes one level further, you guessed it..... THREE HUNDRED  MILLION PEOPLE!!!     Again, all You have to do is send this to 10 people. That's all. (If you  don't understand how we can reach 300 million and all you have to do is  send this to 10 people.... Well, let's face it, you just aren't a  mathematician.    How long would all that take? If each of us sends this email out to ten  more people within one day of receipt, all 300 MILLION people could  conceivably be contacted within the next 8 days!!! I'll bet you I didn't  think you and I had that much potential, did you! Acting together we can  make a difference. If this makes sense to you, please pass this message on.     PLEASE HOLD OUT     UNTIL THEY LOWER THEIR PRICES TO THE $1.30 RANGE AND KEEP THEM DOWN.  THIS CAN REALLY WORK. To make this work try and drive 5-10 miles a week by just combining you trips to the store etc.

      Well you know how it goes, no two people like there food cooked the same way. This is true of my wife who likes her steaks well done, and I do mean well done. So I put her's on about 20 minutes before mine as usual. This will work out good most of the time except, on the special 4th of July dinner with steak on the menu. We site down to eat and low and behold her's is red in the middle, so this ruins the whole meal, and I made sure it was done by cutting it to check but here is the glitch it still was red in the middle. You win some and you lose some.

      It seems that when you schedule a scan disc for drive c zone alarm keeps the windows system from doing the scan and the fix for this glitch's to uninstall zone alarm so as to give windows complete control over drive C. Your other drives, if you have them, are not affected by this glitch.

      This is a story of a family who purchases a boat. They put the boat on the lake they live by for the summer. The problem being is every time they drive the boat it will not come up on plane.  They call the Mariana were the boat was purchased and they come to there dock to take it for a spin and yes there is a problem. They do a tune up on the boat and no change, then they change the props still no difference.  Finally they call the Mercury rep in from Florida to see if he can figure out the problem and the first thing he says to the Mariana boss is can I use you forklift and how much will it pick up. They figure it will pick up the 29 foot Bay ,so they proceed to raise the boat up out of the water and low and behold the problem is solved the owner launched the boat and guess what else the trailer still attached to the bottom of the boat problem solved and what a glitch.

      Subject: Foreign Aid  Below are the actual voting records of various Arabic/Islamic States which are recorded in both the US State Department  and United Nations records:      Kuwait votes against the United States 67% of the time.      Qatar votes against the United States 67% of the time.      Morocco votes against the United States 70% of the time.      United Arab Emirates votes against the U. S. 70% of the time.      Jordan votes against the United States 71% of the time.      Tunisia votes against the United States 71% of the time.      Saudi Arabia votes against the United States 73%  of the time.      Yemen votes against the United States 74% of the time.      Algeria votes against the United States 74% of the time.      Oman votes against the United States 74% of the time.      Sudan votes against the United States 75% of the time.      Pakistan votes against the United States 75% of the time.      Libya votes against the United States 76% of the time.      Egypt votes against the United States 79% of the time.      Lebanon votes against the United States 80% of the time.      India votes against the United States 81% of the time.      Syria votes against the United States 84% of the time.      Mauritania votes against the United States 87% of the time.      US Foreign Aid to those that hate us: Egypt, for example, after voting 79% of the time against the United States, still receives $2 billion annually in US Foreign Aid.      Jordan votes 71% against the United States and receives $192,814,000 annually in US Foreign Aid.      Pakistan votes 75% against the United States receives $6,721,000 annually  in US Foreign Aid.      India votes 81% against the United States receives $143,699,000 annually      Perhaps it is time to get out of the UN and give the tax savings back to the American workers who are having to skimp and sacrifice to pay the taxes.      Now they want to cut oil production, We should cut aid to them by 50% to start.       Pass it along.  Everyone needs to know this.   Might even mention it to your congressman, who knows it anyway... what a disgrace....no wonder the world has no respect for us!
