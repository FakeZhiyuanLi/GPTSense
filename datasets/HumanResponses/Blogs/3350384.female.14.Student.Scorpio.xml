      so swim meet tonight. this is the first one that ive actually somewhat enjoyed. though my races sucked. but so for the last race-the 200 meter freestyle relay, i wasnt initially supposed to be in the race. ashley comes running up to me, because she thought that i was swimming with them. but it was actually this girl claire that was supposed to be swimming. but claire is deathly slow. they asked me if i'll swim on their team instead of claire. so we ask the coach (who my dad is fully convinced is gay) and he says its okay. then we ask this girl claire, and she seems fine with it. so we're waiting for it to be our turn to race, and we see claire, crying. omg we all felt sooo bad. but they really wanted to win. lol. and we did, we won. and the coach even said that i had an 'awesome swim.' made me happy. lol. but i still feel bad. maybe ill give her my donut tomorrow...nah. krispy kreme...too good to waste.

         "A 16-year-old Leo High School student died Saturday evening in a two-car crash on Garman Road in northern Allen County, Indiana State Police said. Lindsay R. Jackson was a passenger in a Chrysler convertible driven by Aaron L. James, 16, of Huntertown. James collided with a vehicle driven by Scott T. Burns, 18, of Auburn, near the intersection of Garman and Hull roads shortly before 8 p.m., state police said. Jackson died at the scene. The Allen County Coroner’s Office determined she died of blunt force trauma to her head and neck, Coroner Dr. E. Jon Brandenberger said. She was wearing a seat belt, but it couldn’t save her life because of the severity of the impact, police said. Burns and James were both hospitalized in fair condition Sunday. James was airlifted to Parkview Hospital with injuries to his face and head. Burns injured his lower leg, police said. Troopers continued to investigate the accident cause Sunday. The vehicles collided head-on as the James car was eastbound and the Burns car was westbound. The collision occurrednear the center of the road, police said."           yeah so what were the assholes doing? thats right-playing chicken. scott and aaron should have been the ones to die, not lindsay. it makes you think about how fragile life really is, and how so many things, even life in general, are taken for granted. lindsay, the only innocent one in the incident, was the one to die. at least scott is 18 and can be tried as an adult. i hope they're brought up on manslughter-and convicted. i hate them both. i did before this, but this has just deepened that so much more. fucking bastards.        its so sad.

       im kinda nervous right now. ummm so chris called last night wanted me to do something, but i couldn't, and he said he'll probably call tonight to see if i can. but if my parents know hes called 2 days in a row theyre gonna be 'uh oh...' they dont want me hangiong out with guys, but thats stupid because sarah and chelsey had shitloads of guy friends and my parents had no problem with it. but its me and they go spastic. my dad was an ass about collyn calling all the time. its not like theres anything going on with chris, but my parents are still gonna be suspicious. so fucking overprotective.   and i dont wanna do anything with him unless danae is going, so that im more comfortable. and also my parents will probably only let me if danae is going too.&nbsp; so if she cant go, then i need t o make up an excuse. lol. and danae is the same way about it all.    &nbsp;  urlLink  http://www.hometown.aol.com/xoblueangel89xo/memories.html    thats just like a ton of pictures and memories and everything of all of my friends. of all that i've missed. i just about cried looking at it. i miss them so much. they have their pictures from the dance, and i remember looking forward to that so much, and then having missed it and seeing how awesome they all look, how happy they all look. and, dont get me wrong, i like seeing them happy and everything, i just really wish that i were there, that i&nbsp;was part of it all. they all mean so much to me. i need to go back. it would be so awesome even if i went there for like a month, just so that i can see everyone. maybe thats what ill convince my parents to let me do next summer. but god thats a long time away.    &nbsp;  i love you all

       oh my god. my mom is being such a bitch. so the kids were upstairs eating, being their usual annoying selves, and i whipped alyssa with the towel. but it didnt actually work, so the towel just kinda flopped, brushing her back as it fell. but of course, she wanted to get me in trouble, so she ran outside and told my mom that i was hitting her. so naturally, madre came inside and starting bitching at me about always fighting with them. what the fuck. okay, i havent fought with them  at all  since sarah moved out, which was quite a while ago. my main source of stress was removed, and i've been doing great. but they fight  all the fucking time  and they're always hitting eachother and shit, and she doesnt do anything about it. what ever happened to all those threats and all those punishments that were going to happen for every time someone fought? i have not seen them get punished  once  since that whole lecture. it pisses me off so much. the most discipline i've seen is last night ryan made them sit on separate couches. my parents dont do shit to those kids, and yet they wonder why they don't listen at all, not even to them.

      i havent written in here in forever...or a week. but whatever, same thing. chris has been less of an asshole, so thats been pretty awesome. he can be fun when hes not being an ass. needs to keep his clothes on though. trying to show off muscles that he doesnt have. today we were outside putting coins on the railroad tracks. i have a dime and a quarter all squashed, danae has a quarter and a penny, and chris has a nickle. we have 2 more out there waiting&nbsp; for a train. great fun. lol. he dropped his 20 so i stole it, and he came and picked me up again. i need to gain some weight so he cant do that anymore. its kinda scary. but fun too...whatever. im just kind of rambling. i still have the smell of smoke from the kiln in my nose. god i love the smell of fire and smoke. i was just standing there inhaling, while everyone else was coughing. lol.

      i never know what to write in here anymore got plaster all over myself today i was wiping off danae's face witha paper towel and this nasty ass girl made a comment about it being cute. so i said "just wait until i start licking it off..." she gave me funny looks for the rest of the day i'd rather she didnt look at me at all creepy kid stares at me and danae a lot. god that kid is annoying every other word he says is 'fuck' and i just wanna yell at him to shut the fuck up and stop talking like a fucking moron. lol. i think the nasty kid finally washed his hair...still wearing the same clothes though ryan is here hes gonna have to go to church with us hahaha poor guy so long ass swim meet today. 5 hours. 3-8. i didnt show up until 4 though, but they were just starting anyways. i swam the first 2 events and the last 2, and had to sit around doing nothing for about 3 hours in between. loads of fun. especially with my many friends...so naturally, i took a nap i think i need to be less anti-social people tend to annoy me though and i suck at approaching people especially when i'm half naked wearing a swim cap very attractive, of course and there are like no hot guys at this art thing. unless you want to count one of the teachers... mmm still wondering whats up with the chiquita obsession...

      my grandma had gas tonight. oh my god. i wanted to die. we were sitting at dinner, and every couple of minutes she would let one rip. and they werent discreet, quiet farts either. full blown. and of course, no one wanted to say anything, because its grandma. and like whenever she farted, ahe wouldn't even acknowledge it, she just kept on doing what she was doing. i wanted to laugh sooo bad. especially after my grandma farted, and my dad looked at my little sister mckayla, thinking that it was her. lol but oh my god, it was so bad.  theresa called me last night at like 9:45, but we're not allowed to take calls after 8. so i didnt get to talk to her, and she wasnt home when i called her back today. so i dont know if shes going to call me tonight or not, but its already 7:30. it makes me happy that she called me though.  sarah moved out the other day, i dont know if i said anything about that already. im gonna have my own room! whoohoo!  im burnt. not too bad though.  i would be watching tv right now, but my grandma is over there. lol.
