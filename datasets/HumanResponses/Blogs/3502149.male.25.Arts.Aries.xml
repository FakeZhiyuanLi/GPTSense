      it was rather sweltering in LA today.  I spent most of the day sitting in corner of my apartment where there is no ventilation and I have two computers running.  It's sort of a modern digital version of hell in that corner.  Spent my time in hell finishing two comics I am drawing for friends as birthday gifts. You see, I started drawing pictures for presents a while back.  I was unemployed, had been for months, and had little income to spare on gifts.  So i started drawing funny pictures for people.  Usually focused around cariacatures of them and funny stuff that had happened between us.  The bad part was I was inclined, through some sort of artistic pride, to outdue myself every time I did a new birthday drawing.  The first one i did in an hour on a piece of copier paper with throw away Bic mechanical pencils.  The next was done equally quick but scanned into the computer where type was added.  On and on it went. Now I am to the point where I have taken it upon myself to complete two 4 page comic books for two friends whose birthdays are two days apart in early june.  So I have taken this long, hot Memorial Day weekend to sit in the hot corner of my apartment and draw instead of going to barbeques and watching bad big-budget movies. Though I found solace in taken my "break" time as a monent to fool around making old school heavy metal songs in Garage Band on my Mac.  That program rocks.  Thank you Steve Jobs for the ever-growing gifts you have bestowed upon us.

      so tired.  that's all i can say.  i worked for two weeks straight and then they gave me a four day weekend and I spent the whole time off moving into my new apartment.  then i went to spiderman 2 at midnight last night and got home around 3.  so i'm still exhausted.  and it's not done yet.

      it must be fun for people who have the ability to stand in the middle of bad things and say they take no blame.  they were merely privy to it and had no part in the actual decisions of the act.  they will never appologize cause in their eyes they never did anything wrong.  they were only unwilling pawns to everyone  else's mistakes.  they sleep easy.  conscious clear.  good for them.  good for fucking them.  i toss and turn waay too foten to let shit like that stand.  but when no one trusts you, no one listens to you.  you can't convince anyone.  you are not the cause, nor the effect. you are but the medium allowing the action to be done. you are not the bullet, or the trigger, you are the barrel of the gun.  so thanks for that.  about two years ago was the last time i tried to talk.  you denied me that.  i will carry a small scar forever.

      i get the feeling that people back east tend to think my hollywood life is really glamorous.  that just working in entertainment means that i sit in some posh office with state of the art equipment and free bagels and evian.  i guess that's true if you work somewhere nice, like my friends at nickelodeon and their dual monitors and clean carpets, but i don't work somewhere nice.  i, in fact, work somewhere cheap.  the game show i create art for is produced in a really old, run-down studio lot in glendale called, get this: glendale studios.  it's kinda dirty and smelly.  there's lots of cats that live on the lot and use the spaces around our little house/office space as their litter box.  there's all these old cars on jacks in the back of the parking lot.  I'm talkng OLD too.  like old packards and shit from the late 50's.  one has a tarp over it that's held down by a coffee can.  seems straight out of some old service station back east not the lot of a television studio.  even my most "high profile" gig, working on the Stars Wars documentary for Fox and Lucasfilm, was all produced at a production house in Culver City.  The building was kind of cheap and for a few weeks the AC was stuck on and it was super cold in our area.  They only had one Zip drive that you had to track down every time you wanted to use it.  I had to cut down oversized file folders to make the regular letter-sized ones.  I had to bring my own VCR and DVD in so I could check the cut for changes without having to find an unused AV cart.  It was funny.  friends asked if i had tried on the Wookie suit yet.  I think they had some idea that I was workig up in Marin County at Skywalker Ranch.  ppfff!  yeah, right.  I logged footage on a cable home improvement show.  they put us loggers in these way-back desks.  there was an ant colony back there.  so when I would be watching the DV footage and typing in the time changes, I would have to periodically look down and flick tiny ants off my arms.  Which usually meant I miss a camera cut and had to rewind.  I won't even get into the production facilities on Surreal Life.  Let's just say damp basement and the overwhelming smell of old cardboard and leave it at that.  So, basically, my jobs in LA have had the same amoutn of character as my fun-filled work-a-day jobs back east.  I still shoot for the job where I can ride a Razor scooter around and wear hawaiin shirts like at Pixar.  But I sure as hell haven't gotten there yet5.

      it will. ask anybody.  it's gonna end sometime.  so does my vagueness.  Q&A!!!  1) How do you want to die? something cool like saving a kid or a puppy or a kid's puppy.  or having a HUGE rod of rebar shoot right through my skull killing me instantly as it severs my synapses and renders my head in half.  2) What do you think happens after you die?  my mom cries a lot and hopefully obeys my wishes to NOT have a long boring, depressing Catholic funeral.  3) When did you first understand that you were going to die? i think i was pretty young.  i flipped off my bike after running over a giant inflatable football that then lodged itself between my front wheel and the chromoly frame.  as i stared down at the chip-seal street surface below i thought i might die.  after that i knew...  4) Do you believe in deathbed escorts, contact with the dead, ghosts, angles or reincarnation? i DON"T not believe in that stuff.  5) What do you want you epitaph to read? nai elye hiruva  -in sindarin elvish it means "maybe even thou shalt find it"  somewhere someone just yelled out, "NERD!" in a bad impression of Jimbo Jones

      no, not the clap...  it's getting hot again.  i guess i'd rather be able to say that than when i lived back east and every fall meant the inevitable crepping in of the idea: "it's gonna get cold again"  i am starting to box and move my stuff from my apartment in Studio City all the way over Toluca Lake into the new apartment on Maple Street in Burbank.  I make it sound far cause it's not far by any standards.  even those wierd old, english pirate standards.  like hog's heads and links and chains and nuckles and fathoms.  it's like a five minute drive.  it occurred to me the other day how long it's been since I talked to matt.  but every time i call he's gone.  it is the summer.  i guess that makes sense.  the time when they all forget me seems very close.  i can't stay routed in their lives forever.  i chose to move to try and get somewhere i only dreamed of.  i guess i had wished it would have been a bigger thing when i left.  like people would have got real sad and talked about me.  i guess it's partkly my fault that not a lot of people cared when i finally shoved off to jolly old Los Angeles.  still, you always wonder if anyone is staring out their window, looking to the west...  or if anyone actually reads these stupid blogs.

      well, the show is saved.  and i'll know in a week whether they want the final 65 episodes and if I have a job for a while.  this is all good because I have to move into an apartment soon with a roomate that has an odd half poor, half buddhist sense of personal possessions.  So it goes to mr. rich-digital-artist to fill the void with cheap IKEA furniture.  I kind of would like this place to look like I am actually trying to furnish it.  All my other apartments have been an amalgum of Walmart-bought furniture, hand-me-down stuff, thrift store couches, and tables bought from the Super Saturday Saver ads.  I'm 25 years old and make OK money for god's sake.  If only I could escape the inevitable call of home electronics, the dual 2 Ghz G5, or the almighty Evo and actually spend some money on something else.  In other news I have found that I always laugh at the word "penis."  it's a funny word.  funny like the name Turd Ferguson.  I have also taken it upon myself to convince Justin and Russ to add a scene to their pitch kit that involves someone saying, "I'm sorry sir but we don't have anymore shrimp cocktails" in a funny voice with a heavy lisp.

      He answered my prayers and the show didn't get dumped.  I  ordered my St. Jude visor clip from www.aquinasandmore.com yesterday.  shit you not.  they sell stuff like that.  The U.S. automotuve mindset has worked it's way into Roman Catholic culture.  Awesome.    The show is far from done.  We have to change everything before we start shooting in two weeks.  fun, fun, fun until my daddy takes my G4 away.  In unrelated news my car is super dirty.  so much so, that my roomate wrote "wash me" in the dust covering it's black enamel exterior.  first time for everything i guess.  this is the stupidest thing i have ever put online.  and i've posted on forums drunk...

      i happen to find corpse's funny.  one of the writer's on the show suggested a t-shirt that said on the front, "Jesus is Coming..."  and on the back, "And I'm Gonna Swallow."  hahahahahaha.  so bad that it's oh-so-good.

      So John Gallo and my friends in the band Orodruin put out a split vinyl with Reverend Bizarre.  It is awesome as all their doom is.  I have been playing it a lot.  Especially the first track: Ascending Damnation.  great song, great riffs, great lyrics from Mike Puleo.  Buy it from www.hellridemusic.com  In related news, I had ANOTHER dream about Joanne last night.  This one was even more annoying.  She was talking to me but the words coming out of her mouth were lyrics from Ascending Damnation: "I haven't felt so much anger in all of my years, so I have been sent to destroy you; expose all your fears."  That threw me for a loop because I normally would associate those lyrics as words I would TO HER.  The fact that the dream had any kind of anger being projected from her onto me really bothered me.  Since her life fell reasonably back into place and mine was completely changed.  During the dream, in my mind's mind(?), I kept thinking about how on earth she could be angry with me?  Why did she have a score to settle?  She's the unfeeling one; the one that wouldn't admit her mistake or any kind of fault in the matter.  I'm the emotional one.  I'm the one who carries grudges and secretly longs for things like revenge, vengeance, and other fun words involving combinations of v's and g's.  So I'm pretty much at a loss as to what sparked this dream and what it means.  But it bothered me a lot.  One: because I don't like thinking about things I can't change that happened over 2 years ago and 3000 miles away.  Two: because it means I am still not over it all.  The ghosts of the Genesee still plague me.  Haunt me in my sleep.

      people might ask me where the name "Time of the Static" comes from.  well, if anyone read this.  It's from a short sci-fi story about a kid who buys a VCR that allows him to fast forward live TV until he sees nothign but static.  He figures this is when the world ends.  He's an average teenager and instead of telling anyone of the end to prvent it, he decides to live his life to the fullest and asks out a girl. In the end of the story he refers to the end of the world as "The Time of the Static."  I drank a couple beers the other night, got a headache and slept really badly.  I had a few dreams about Joanne which was wierd in itself cause i rarely think about her anymore.  I guess all my thoughts about the end of the world have driven Rochester and her and such back into my thoughts.  I would have slept horribly either way.  But it doesn't help much when I slip back into my old patterns of examining my life through hindsight.  Especially when part of your modern epiphany has been to realize that an act was unaviodable. My life in Rochester was meant to come to an end.  i think it would have crashed down at some point later through some similar circumstances that could have been much more violent, much more penetrating, much more dire. My only question left is: would i still be so sad?

      people in LA love the darkness.  and i admit they are a very good band.  my problems with this band are thusfold:  1.  i know and have heard bands who are playing music like this in Western New York State who take it very seriously.  They play gigs are shitty dive bars in East Avon and then hop in their chevy van or their bitchin' camaro and go home to comb their mullets.  They don't get famous cause they aren't from england and they don't appeal to hipsters.  2.  I saw them play live on MTV and the lead guitarist used a kapo to play a a lead in the higher octvaes of his guitar.  A kapo?!  what the fuck?  learn to play the damn lead without it.  You're not a folk guitarist and those are the only people i allow to play kapos sans ridiclue.  3.  Too many sequined outfits, pants, headbands, etc.  Too gay for me.  Just stick with the dirty rocker look.  Check out Jet for inspriation.  4.  The drummer's kit is too fucking small.  If you are gonna play all out, high energy cock-rock you HAVE to play a huge fucking kit.  Think of some bastard child of Lars Ulrich and Peter Criss's drum kits.  5.  They are way too sloppy live to pull off the kind of music they claim to want to play.  and all their solos sound pretty much exactly the same as the ones on the record.  I don't get mad when someone puts them on.  But I will never call The Darkness one of my favs.  not even my top ten...

      the guy's working on my sink smelled gas and called the gas company.  one of the burners in my stive was broken filling the house with slow-moving gas fumes.  threatening me with imminent doom if i had beendoing something like using my flint and steel to start a fire in the apartment.  so now i have no stove.  if my fridge breaks it will pretty much render the room, that was once called a kitchen, completely uselsss to me.

      i did a lot of drinking this weekend.  which was fun.  I went to the OC.  which was fun.  I spent a night at the bar with bill and justin.  which was fun and expensive.  I haven't had a lot of time to do anything fun in a while.  and now my apartment has no sink.  they came and tore it out.  rending a large hole in my countertop.  so i am microwave dinner duty for the rest of the week.  drinking water and koolaid out of styrofoam cups i pilfered from work.  just thought i'd share two random thoughts.

      three things have come up:  1)  i desperately need to get a hair cut and get my brain back in order.  I mean, there's all the usual personal constitution and personal well being issues to worry about when one's hair grows long and constant exhaustion leaves you failing to conjure concrete thoughts.  The pressing issue is my constant struggle to have a conversation without forgetting things, names, etc.  My lack of cohesive sentences.  I have even lost the ability to figure out the right thing to do in most situations: either doing whatever pops into my head and appologizing with a chuckle and a shrug or not doing much at all and fading into the background.  case in point: i spent an hour or so in the OC talking to a girl by the ocean last weekend.  Her account would probably be better evidence, but to me it seemed as if I wasn't making much sense.  Just kind of stumbling along.  Like running done a steep hill -- you trip a lot but keep the pace up due to gravity.  I wonder if I came off like  a complete goob or if any of my statements were in the least bit insightful, intelligent, or charming.  The clincher was when she got out of the car I think I gave her a "dude" shake or something.  I can chalk that one up more to exhaustion.  Either way I need to get some nice rest and relaxation and a good clean harcut.  The latter if only to impress any girls willing to put up with my horrible conversation again.  2)  i know now when the show is done: august 13th.  Then i am free.  Hallelujah.  3)  After the show I am going to go back east and lie around and drink beer and get my head screwed back on tight.  It will solve two problems: one being my need of a vacation, the other my need to replace the acoustic guitar of justin's that i inadvertantly broke one night while moving a pillow.  Moving a pillow?  how silly is that?  fuck yo couch, jigga.  FUCK YO COUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      my eyes like leaden doors. no matter how hard i try they fall. bringing a parfect-dark canvas for the green phosphor to paint across like the black of the sea around 3 a.m.  long before my hair grew short i said once that: 2 o'clock in the morning means something different.  does 4 in the morning lie east of different? west? across the sea air that fills my nostrils and clings to someone else's shirt barely fitting my frame?  forgetting the difference engines. forgetting the time of the static. forgetting the pride of the fallen.  all to stand on the end of a pier with a girl in a town like an hour south of heaven.

      not really.  well parts of it i guess.  but it's been really ass-tastically hot in my apartment.  which makes everything loads more fun.  cooking?  more fun.  TV?  more fun.  sitting around with a huge fan blowing directly on your genitals?  OH MY GOD, so much fun.  So, the three weeks of prep the show was supposed to have got axed and we are shooting shows again to try to adhere to the old, old, old schedule.  It sucks and I haven't had a day off in about a month.  Now they are talking about the show getting picked up for a 2nd season.  Just when I thoought I could get out, they pull me back in.  Guess I can't complain with the paychecks.  so i'm really tired and can't really think straight so i don;t have anything really interesting to say.  My car needs brake work.  I'd like to smoke a cigarette.  I've been watching an odd combination of Batman: The Animated Series and Once Upon A Time In The West, so I think that if i could make some genetic amalgum of Bruce Timm and Sergio Leone that I would worship it as my new God.  that's it, fuck-o's.  maybe i'll write more interesting things after a few days off.

      man, life has been suck-tacular.  let me explain:  no sink.  no stove.  bad faucet in the bathroom.  then i gets a really bad flu.  rendering me pretty dead to the world with a delirium-inducing fever.  then a sink with a garbage disposal.  still sick.  wasted money seeing The Village.  new stove.  but no where to plug it in.  and the sink is disassembled due to leaking.  roofers show up at 7 am to tear the roof off my building.  basically pounding and scraping on the roof right above my bedroom while i try to sleep off a bad flu.  sink works.  stove works.  no garbage disposal.  holes in the wall.  faucet works.  holes half filled.  still roofing.  at 7 am everyday.  back at work.  fuck yo couch.
