      hi... i went for a ceramah in MiTC (Malacca international Trading Centre) guess what's the topic about? the education minister wants us to know each religions and hopes that we Malaysian will unite after knowing their religion.  the whole thing was so boring...(and quite interesting if the speakers don't follow everything printed in our texts and read it out in malayish english...  thank god... the buddist speaker .. mr. oh spoke in malay although he's a chinese buddist who sits in a wheelchair and teaches malay tuition... he was a good speaker( coz he's a teacher!!!) he spoke his life experiences etc. in MALAY!! the audience(95% malay) were supprised too!  the muslim speaker ... woah! he was a hindu indian who converted to islam. and when he spoke.. he can recall which page of al-quran and which line and which paragraph did the famous lines were. he can even memorize it out like he is a salesman proving to us with evidence, and when he talks.. he will be holdong the Koran like he was in court holding the bible during his" i swear to god that i will tell the truth and not tell lies"moment. and .. he can even recall out the hindu's holy words in islamic(arab), english and malay.. he can translate al-quran's  holy writings to other languges too... and of course.. while holding the Koran and stating which page and which whatever-it-is...  the hindu one was quite boring as my headmaster slept during the session... can u believe my headmaster was sleeping during a seminar!!! and of course the other students were playing Lingo, joking around and ask riddles.. i started to read dan brown's angels and demons... which i managed to read 90 something pages in an hour! that's my second fastest record ... so far, my fastest was while i was preparing PMR... it was like flipping teh pages to see pictures and not reading the text!  and the last forum/session was .. science and religion. how glad was i to read a part of angels and demons before the forum.. they were only 3 of them, the "buddist malay-speking guy who gratuated from america and met with an accident when he was 24 while he was teaching in sarawak" guy /monk went home. the 3 of them debated/chatted/argued on which "book of holy's stated about the big bang theory 1st." and of course, all 4 religions haf sayings of the bigbang theory in their holy's...  during the Q and A session, i asked them on their believes in ghosts.. they all believe that they are spirits of the dead and bla bla bla... the funniest one was the hindu guy said that the hindu's believe that ghosts stay in out world for 5000 years b4 they go to the other world. another question i asked was .. according to dan brown's angels and demons.. ms. vetra said tat syaitan and satan were different "ghosts" which were related.. the speakers said that they haf.... no differences and said that syaitan was in malay, satan in english and syaiton in arab..  and that night was the chinese orchestra's 39th anniversary. i ate, played, recieved my hamper/present/gift and performed .... so tiring!! and i watched 3 recaps of a same match that night on RTM's olympics "LIVE".. so damn boring...  that's all i'm in mysql class now.. chao
