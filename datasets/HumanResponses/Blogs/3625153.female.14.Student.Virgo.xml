       ~~>josh and i have been talking about us. its been so different since our fight last week.. =\  it makes me really sad because it seemed like everything between us was so perfect before..  ~~>but to tell you the truth, which i dont really wanna do because i dont wanna hurt anyones feelings here, but im trying to be completely honest here, i dont really know too much about josh. we talk and all but.. its hard to explain. our relationship is so different from any others ive had..  ~~>which, may be a good thing, i really care for him so i cant really say too much i guess.. i really love him a lot and really wish i could be closer to him so we could take care of each other.. i think maybe we could have a much better relationship offline than online. which kinda sounds dumb if you read it, you might say "of course its better offline, you get to know a person better" or something like that, but i have relationships with people that are much better over the net than they are off it. and these are people that i know from school and such.  ~~>moving on.. it seems i cant feel anything anymore. i dont know whats wrong with me. its like i dont care about anyone but myself because i cant feel much for others, but i know i really do care for them. sometimes i feel like everything in my life is so fake because of that. example.. ok, a little over a week ago josh told me that he had just found out he might have a kid with another girl. i got really upset at him, or at least i appeared to be upset with him.. i really wasnt upset at all. i mean, it surprised me, and i dont want him being attached to a girl he doesnt care for as more than a friend, but i wasnt upset or angry. i just acted that way mostly because i thought that was how i was supposed to act.  ~~>sucky thing is, i cant tell josh any of this. i know hes gonna read this anyway, which i really kinda want; not that i want to hurt him but i do want him to know. i dont know.. maybe its better if he didnt.. but anyway. i dont want him to think i dont care for him or about anything hes going through because i really do. i just.. its not how its supposed to be..  ~~>i guess ill go now.. i have more to say, about other things, but i dont feel like talking anymore right now. everything in here seems so depressing =(  be happy.. i love you joshua, and always will no matter what we have to go through. dont ever forget that. i never want to lose you..

       ~~>im so scared right now.. ive been laying in my room thinking about stuff. i had a really bad dream last night about the end of the world. ive been ok all day but now i have to go to bed and turn all the lights out and be so so quiet..  ~~>it started off not so bad. we were at some park riding the rides and everyone was having such a good time. and then.. something happened.. everyone started dying, just falling over and bleeding and things exploding.. everyone was panicking and praying.. my mom and i had gotten on this ride and she thought it was fun so she went again and took my dad along with her, but they never came off.. something happened to it, it got jammed or something and everyone on there died.. what made it worse was that the people operating it got it working again and when they opened the doors everyone standing at the exit could see all the bodies and i could see them.. there was blood everywhere.. but i didnt cry, i got on my knees for a minute and then just walked away.. and somehow i knew that this was happening everywhere, that everyone all over the world was dying, and so i prayed to God, i dont remember all of what i said but i remember that i felt bad for being like i am, that i was so unworthy of Him and going to Heaven and that i wanted to be better.. then i joined my friends, we were hiding in this place underground with a bunch of other people.. i know josh was there, i couldnt see him but i felt it.. and bridgette, my cousins, kaleigh, kristen, brittani.. it felt like we had formed some kind of alliance.. we needed each other to survive, to fight against something..  ~~>im so frightened and cold.. im afraid to go back in my room.. to even look up from the monitor.. the light in the closet is on and the door is open, like somethings gonna pop outta there any minute now.. i feel so sick, maybe from crying also but.. =\  ~~>someone please help me..

       ~~>im soooo bored. i dont even know why im writing right now. i should be reading or doing those notecards or cleaning my room. but of course i had to get on to talk to josh.. hehe. hmm.. i dont know what i feel like doing. everything and nothing at the same time. oh, the joyous feelings that summer brings.  ~~>oh! hey hey hey! i was taking a shower today and i looked down at my leg and the J is still there! haha. its a miracle! yaay.  ~~>so what now.. i think ill go.. josh is getting mad at me again. all i wanted to do was write so i could get it out and move on. ::sighs:: relationships are hard..  ~~>ill leave you with a poem that was inspired by.. uhh, i suppose ill keep calling him seth. not really a good thing.. =\  The pain comes and goes Like a breeze On a summer day. Te quiero... One thought of you And the pain is diminished. Around everything A bright light, A feeling of hope. Te quiero... You leave And the pain lingers. There is no breeze, No light. And the darkness can consume my soul. Te quiero... Forever and ever. Do you love me? I can't be sure Even if you tell me. Te quiero... But you are a mystery to me.  ill post more poems later..

       ~~>hmm.. where to start? well.. a few nights ago (tuesday the 13th) josh and i got into a huge fight. the comment i left on my journal the other day hurt his feelings. he told me he felt as if it didnt matter that he was talking to me the night before after i told bryan that my night started off lonely but he made it 100 times better. soo.. josh and i ended up fighting for an hour and a half. what fun!  ~~>at first we were fighting for about thirty minutes. he said he was thinking about something he read in my journal and then copied and pasted the comment into the IM and said that it just surprised him. -->juggalopimpjosh (10:56:22 PM): LPdude435 said...  thats true boo. lol. the night started out kinda lonely but got 100 times better when i started talking to you. you cool little kid you.. i mean! guy! you cool guy! hehe.. later gator. =)   well it just suprised me  -->ymcm8 (10:57:16 PM): we were talking at like 2 this morning -->ymcm8 (10:57:22 PM): you said you had passed out -->ymcm8 (10:57:30 PM): i was trying to get to you for two hours -->ymcm8 (10:57:39 PM): i was lonely when you were gone -->juggalopimpjosh (10:58:13 PM): ok i guess it just gotten to me that all  -->ymcm8 (10:58:27 PM): im sorry -->ymcm8 (10:58:30 PM): hes just a friend -->ymcm8 (10:58:38 PM): i havent talked to him in like a year -->ymcm8 (10:58:51 PM): and we were goofing off last night -->ymcm8 (10:58:59 PM): just makin each other laugh ~~>then he told me he was thinking about not talking to me until after this weekend. it really surprised me that he was so angry he wouldnt wanna talk to me for a week. but then he said that he wasnt going to do that to me. -->ymcm8 (11:03:17 PM): you dont wanna talk to me? -->juggalopimpjosh (11:03:47 PM): yes i do  -->ymcm8 (11:04:06 PM): so what the hell are you saying -->juggalopimpjosh (11:05:27 PM): nothing i told you i was unhappy about some other guy making your so better it like i was nothing last night but i guess i will get over it  -->ymcm8 (11:05:42 PM): joshua -->ymcm8 (11:05:52 PM): you werent barely there last night -->ymcm8 (11:06:00 PM): real late last night -->ymcm8 (11:06:32 PM): im sorry that i found someone to talk to ~~>so he gets even more mad at me. he had surgery the day before and was in a lot of pain; thats why he had stopped talking to me in the first place.  ~~>oh how i hate fighting with people.. i try not to get mad, to stay calm; i think thats better than to just yell at the other person, you dont get anything resolved that way. but geez.. he was getting so angry at me for talking to someone i havent talked to in so long, someone thats just a friend to me and nothing more. (oh please josh dont get angry again if youre reading this..) him saying that he was unhappy about another guy making me better.. it made me feel like hes the only one im supposed to talk to, like i shouldnt have friends, he should be enough for me. josh means so much to me, dont get me wrong, but i do have other people that i talk to besides him.  ~~>but anyway.. after that we kind of just talked for about twenty minutes, both of us apologizing again and again. then i said something to make him really upset.. not even going to go into that.. but we ended up fighting for another twenty minutes. it was pretty intense..  ~~>then he told me he gave himself a little "reminder".. -->juggalopimpjosh (1:07:09 AM): i did it because i was mad at myself for being like that since i was jealous that guy made you feel better and i didn't , i did it to remind me that i don't want to treat you like that again -->juggalopimpjosh (1:09:26 AM): baby , im sorry  -->ymcm8 (1:09:39 AM): its ok.. -->juggalopimpjosh (1:10:28 AM): no it not  -->juggalopimpjosh (1:11:12 AM): i have treated you so bad and you should be treated a lot better then i have tonight -->juggalopimpjosh (1:13:07 AM): meggie i love you but i am not sure what to do next -->ymcm8 (1:13:27 AM): i love you.. he loves me.. =)  ~~>so after that we.. uhh.. talked for a little while more. he made a journal and talked about how he felt about me and our fight. i left this comment for him: -->hey joshua,  sexyboyjosh eh? you are sexy. and cute. =) makes me wanna eat you all up..  i need pictures of your sexyness. =Þ ima print out your sexyness and tape it on my wall so i can look at it every single night. =)  im so sorry about tonight. i know that it was my fault because of what i said, and i really wish that i could take it back. i know it hurt you so much and i didnt mean to hurt you. i love you so much. i really hope that we can get past this and be like before.. i dont wanna lose you.  --meggie  ~~>and then he said: -->Hey baby ,  thanks for your comment , i hope we can get past it too, i don't want to lose you either . I love you megan , I hope we can be like before and maybe please each other soon .   meggie i know you didn't mean to hurt me but you did hurt me and it going to take some time . baby i will get you that pictures soon .  night baby i love you so much .  josh ::sighs:: isnt he the best? =)   ~~>i hated fighting with him so much, and i  know he hated it too. it really sucks though because it kind of changed things between us. i know it hasnt even been a week since the fight and we still need more time to get over it, but its so hard. before i never thought that we could fight; everything was so perfect between us. but now i know that it is possible and its just.. different..  ~~>so were trying though. the other night i was so sad and i missed him so much i decided to use scissors - yes, scissors, dont judge me - to, um, put a J in my leg. it worked, lol. it only stayed for like two days though. it still hurts if i push on it. =/  ~~>so i guess ill stop talking now, lol. i didnt know this entry was going to be so long! ive been writing non-stop for 40 minutes. most since.. uhh.. i cant even remember. a looong time. and the south park movie is about to end and ima go to bed after that. kenny is such a cute little kid.. i love seeing him without that little orange hood on his head. =) later journal.

       ~~>Yo my peoplez. lol. Ok, so my "peoplez" is a population of two, but I don't care. Here's to my bestest buddies in the world: I love you guys so much you don't even know. That's why I'm making this journal.. for you guys.   ~~>yeah. so enough of the mushy crap and the typing right thing. screw it all. i wanna be myself on this journal. hell yeah. lol.   ~~>ok so this is my first night on the blog. i created a journal on AOL about 8 months ago and wrote in it like 4 times (lol), but im gonna transfer the entries and the comments over here anyways cuz they do mean something to me.   ~~>lets see.. well.. last summer sucked, but at least it was more eventful than this one. even though there was a lot of drama and shit goin on. dont wanna remind myself of it.. but anyway, this summer has been all right. (i finally spelled it right..) i met this really great guy named josh (one of my "peoplez", haha..). oh man. this guy. what can i say about josh. hes just, the best thing thats come into my life in such a very long time. i honestly dont know what i would do without this guy. id prolly be like karate chopping everyone. =Þ no but really, i can see that he loves me and really truly cares about me, and i really care about him. ::sighs:: we meet in a few weeks. =) im soo happy about that. i need this right now, something to get me going, get my hopes up, something to look forward to. mmm.. i love you joshua.   ~~>now on to ameena. ameena.. you and i have been best friends for so long. i know at times i can be annoying and do things you might not agree with, but i know no matter what youll always be here for me. and i just wanna let you know that ill always be here for you too. =) no matter what. i love ya.   ~~>hmm.. im starting high school soon. im still gonna be at a school without ameena =( but hopefully she can get a transfer for tenth grade. that would be awesome goin to school w/ her again. ah. high school. the joy. actually, im not really worried about it. the only thing im really worried about is possibly having to take showers with the other girls. UGH. im almost crying just thinking about it. i have like this social anxiety thing, and it was hard enough for me just changing in front of the other girls, hard enough just to try to make it through the whole gym period without getting sick. i think it would be much worse having to take all of my clothes off in front of people ive never seen in my whole freakin life before. i could just do what bryan said.. sue for child pornography! hehe. evilness. ^_^  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:17:25 AM): sue them for child pornography ha  -->ymcm8 (2:17:43 AM): lol  -->ymcm8 (2:17:59 AM): hmm  -->ymcm8 (2:18:04 AM): you just gave me an idea  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:18:06 AM): sexual harrassment the teacher told me to do it and i wasn't willing to take my clothes off in front of her!  -->ymcm8 (2:18:20 AM): hell yeah  -->ymcm8 (2:18:21 AM): i would  -->ymcm8 (2:18:43 AM): take em to court and get money for "psychological damage"  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:18:55 AM): exactly  =D   ~~>but anyway. i think im pretty much done for tonight. if i think of something else ill post again later. this entry is pretty damn long already. nighty tighty whities.

       ~~>i feel worthless right now. i feel like nothing should mean anything to me. as if were giving meaning to so many small meaningless things and maybe we arent supposed to or maybe we are, i dont know. i read somewhere (well, it wasnt somewhere like i dont remember, i saw it on someones shirt) the other day that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. but everyone is always nagging at other people for having something that means so much to one person but not the other. people tell other people that theyre giving meaning to something meaningless but really its only meaningless to them; that really isnt fair, its like telling someone not to like something just because you dont like it. life is so complicated.. i dont even wanna think about it anymore. we think too much about everything, but i think things would be so much more simple if we didnt think so much.  ~~>i went to my high school today for this stupid fish camp thing. we sat in the auditorium for an hour listening to the representatives from clubs talk and watching the cheerleaders and dance team do their little performances. then we were walking around the school and lauren was running and these stupid bitches were standing there making fun of all the freshman and how lauren was running and it pissed me off!! so when we passed by them i said "bitch" not really right to the girl but loud enough so she could hear me and possibly think i was talking to her. i hope she did realize i was talking to her. nothing would please me more than to go back and kick her ass and call her bad names and make the little skinny blond girl in the tight shirt and the short denim skirt and flip flops fall to her knees and cry and beg for her mommy and for a break from the torture and wrath of me! mwahaha.. is it a coincidence that the notecard im working on right now is for the word superficial? haha..  ~~>anyway.. i think im going to go now, i feel a little better. i want to talk to josh anyway. i feel bad but i still want to talk to him because i love him and also because i dont want him to think that hes done something wrong. ill write again later to tell about fish camp more.. or maybe tomorrow, who knows.. who knows anything anymore..
