And your love...(your love) Is the music of my heart  What you taught me Only your love could ever teach me You got through when no one could reach me Ohh...ohh...ohh  Cause you always saw in me All the best that I could be It was you who set me free...  You taught me to run You taught me to fly Helped me to free the me inside (me inside) Help me hear the music of my heart Help me hear the music of my heart  You taught me to run You taught me to fly Helped me to free the me inside (me inside) Help me hear the music of my heart (music of my heart) Help me hear the music of my heart You've opened my eyes You've opened the door (opened the door) To something I've never known before (never, never, felt before) And your love...

      everything is wrong all things turn upside down fall on a piece of red paper  words written in dark grey on a piece of black paper  scrambled letters try to form a phrase deep meaning in confusion  but everyone seems fine live in a wrong place like when we're surrounded with forrest we'll never miss the deep blue sea cos we forget everything from original line-ups to what colors match each other  all get used to what is wrong turn upside down along with the upsided world  (dec 24, 2003)

      Why some people say that world is dark? The sun is there but it cannot brighten up the day Many people say I’ve been living all my life in the dark But everyday I can feel the sun so bright  Some hate the cries of little babies Music is always too loud for their hectic days To me, every sound is beautiful like the beat of my own heart Though everybody thinks I live in silence  I’ve never felt empty deep inside For every moment I cherish with songs Don’t stop singing because you think you’re not able Keep on singing for you still have your heart

      When things turn upside down   Not certain of what's  bright or dark   I close my eyes let neglect take over control   Where do I stand?     When nothing seems right   Get me on my nerves day and night   This is not my mistakes  let anger take over control   Where do I stand?     This mountain seems too high to climb   What if I fail before reaching to the top?   Way too risky  let fear take over control   Where do I stand?     When I feel powerless to make a change   Things just get wilder out there   Rather than face the truth, I let denial take over control   Where do I stand?     When things don't turn out the way I plan   Should I let disappointment take control for the rest of my life?   Where do I stand?

       The little Goldie swims alone     Does she ever feel lonely?     In a bowl not even her real home     Does she ever long for where she's supposed to be?      Many creatures walk alone on this earth     Does anyone ever feel like accompanying?     Approaching and not making them feel abandoned     Just for a single touch packed with a smile      Why is there somebody envy the little birdie?     Flying around in peace but what if she's escaping?     Passing the day singing but what if she's crying?     Leaving her mother and siblings where's the loving?      undisguise the blessings     when one search where thankyou's are       Regret no separation for it has its own lessons     Be thankful for the memories grown      Look not to the dark side but to the bright one     Be thankful for life now gets richer      Spend some times alone but don't feel lonely    Be thankful for friendship she used to share      Search no where loneliness end     Be thankful for friendship will knock again      Cos blessings always last

      Dedication Giving and Expecting Nothing in Return What about honesty? Can you say no when your heart tells you so?  When you love your father and mother When you care about your sisters and brothers Do you give all of your heart and soul?  Do you give all of your heart and soul? To your friends and neighbors To your teachers, colleagues, and people all over the world  You’ve heard about gifts and money Wanting and expecting Not to mention hypocrisy Why you smile then stab people in the back?  Does sincerity truly exist? Do you love your God only when He makes your dreams come true? Yet you’re longing for a true love True love does not come from outside, It is inside  Sacred and pure love does exist When will you start believing? That it is there somewhere inside of you

      who are you when you are alone?  no light, no wind no eyes watching no ears listening no one caring  when you are alone, who are you?  you breathe you close your eyes but not fall asleep there is no word but you speak to who? for what?  no beat but you keep on dancing no music but you keep on singing  there is no road for you go nowhere there is no obligation for you follow nobody  there is nothing for you need nothing there is nobody for you love nobody  that heart and soul are there within who is to feel your love? from top to toe, who are you?  who are you when you are alone  (august 27, 2002)

      It used to be so dark in here there was a light but it didn't fall on me   Been trying to find a way out but the road in front of me was once just a dead-end   I thought I was in joy I knew I was in fear been calling out Your name but, Lord, I thought You just didn't hear  In silence I begged You to take me out of this place but something kept dragging me back I knew I had stood too far from You so I couldn't hear Your answers  It used to be so devastating but I knew I had enough strength to break the wall even when these eyes can't see, I can still feel the light cos now I have a soul that shines

      See in the dark with my heart  White candles surrounding  Take a deep breath release all pain  No past or future just this moment     Who were you? What are you gonna be?  Who takes control out of your life?  Who are you gonna owe once you're free?  You and I, We be     Walk down alone the dark alley  How am I supposed to know what's waiting in front of me?  Seek some guard from the One  Who'll surely wrap me with warmth    Sit in the dark  White candles surrounding  Live this moment  We be

      Water the hope so it will grow  When it grows big and tall and strong  The world will know  Don't mind the color let it show   Are you brave enough to reveal your future? Or...you'd rather Find out how dreams destroyed even before you wake up  Cry before sorrow knocks at your door   Let go all the good things for nothing  Water the hope so it will grow  When it grows big and tall and strong  It will protect you  From colorless soul inside of you

      when we are waiting are we really waiting? are we standing still... waiting? are we wondering when we are going to stop waiting?  perhaps we are wasting our time perhaps practicing our swears or wandering around with our restless minds  we can start a conversation with ourselves try to solve some problems we can knowledge ourselves more while waiting  are we really waiting when we are waiting?    october 17, 2002

      Many eyes see the world's lies  When people say right people do wrong  Many hearts feel confused   Too many words hide their real meanings  When people show smiles people betray  Many hands left untouched   I choose to see the truth  When I feel love I feel God  It will soothe my soul  Knowing that it's true   The more we open our hearts  The more we see the truth  When I feel warmth I feel God  I feel the light and it's true   My body is a reflection of my soul  The truth is beyond time  It's when you wake up and fall asleep   Like a prayer or a song  The presence blossoms inside your soul  Your love will grow deeper  The truth revealed once again

      no worries about life, my dear for the morning comes and promises you a brand new day forgive yourself and the sun will forget all the past you can throw it all away or let your wisdom reminisce  no worries about life, my dear for everyone makes mistakes and goes on with his life someday you'll smile the past away you see your life once tumbled down you see it was never that bad  wake up in the morning for the sun and bird and tree give you lessons of life they all dedicate true love to people who appreciate can you give warmth all day and ask nothing? can you sing the clouds away and ask nothing? can you be a shelter through rain and storm and ask nothing?  wake up in the morning or hide inside your cave, lonely, thirsty blame no one but you if only you can see the love inside each creation you'll have no worries about life, my dear

      what's the lesson when you grow up in some unloving family? passing it on to your next generation won't make you feel better  what's the lesson when you grow up witnessing lies? covering yourself up with more lies won't make you feel better  it's up to them to abuse love and the truth now what's your choice?  what's the lesson when words hurt the feeling? making words your best weapon won't make your world any better  what's the lesson when beauty betrays your tender heart? blaming all the good things in life only turns your heart into stone  it's up to them to abuse right and tenderness now what's your choice?

      Everybody can do anything special one do special thing you can dance just like that or gracefully do all that  Reach any star you can reach if you jump just like that reach the brightest star you can reach if you jump with your heart  Born to choose your own destiny in a heavenly garden, are you just another flower? or the most beautiful one?  Divine soul, just be another one or a good one?   (dedicated to a very special dancer and teacher of mine: The Good One!)  (Sep 17, 2002)

      no one can stop you from singing   it's time for you to choose   any kind of genre, tempo, and style   this is your stage of life   pick one theme and sing with your heart     see the road in front of you   traces everywhere nothing's the same   when people want you to follow   and others tell you where to go   what next that you gotta do?     those trees will go where the wind blows    but they will stick to the ground when it gets tough   when all those candles have already blown away   would you stop making a wish?

      he's a soul collector  his tempting smile will make you surrender  leave you empty and soulless  while dancing round and round restless   disappointment breaks the faith down  the warmest wind can't beat the coldest skin  feel like searching for someone to count on  could it be a man  whose spirit made out of sweet lies   he's a soul collector  his tempting smile will make you surrender  leave you empty and soulless  while dancing round and round restless

      We wouldn't be able to love others Before we could love ourselves God has long forgiven us Now it's time for us to forgive ourselves  I remember someone sayin, He's not a nice person to me So I don't waste my time When he doesn't see the flower bloom inside of me He doesn't deserve me or my time  God bless us with love Send us a divine soul full of love We love our sistah and her love God bless us with love Send us a divine soul full of love We love our sistah and her love cos I love God and One Love  What's wrong with freedom anyway? We're all free souls do whatever we do When there's a will there's a way the Crazy Mutha Funky say that too  Days, months, years, pass by More life's lessons learned Joy and pain only make us richer Our sistah today shines brighter   dedicated with our deepest love to Rosie Gaines

      if i saw you in heaven would you still be my sister? would you greet me in front of the door with open arms and sweet smile? would you tell me how much you've been missing me too?  cos I've been getting down on my knees praying for the day to come I've been wondering what it would be like no one can make this dream come true but when i got to come to your place would it still come untrue?  be a good girl just want to be a good girl so God will smile down on me and decide that I deserve a place up there want to see you just want to see you eventually look into your eyes eyes of my soul light

      When the right thing is not right When your heart answers The answers you refuse to hear When life turns into riddle When faith is put on a test To survive you should pass   Questions Too many questions Only one answer Won’t come out Too many values A girl in a society Fulfill too many expectations  Wrong becomes right Nod  Faith is put on a test When right becomes wrong How strong will you struggle? Will you fail your lovely soul? For things you don’t feel right.

      I am a rainbow I make the world so colorful I choose to chase the rain away I am a lot of hopes rising up again  I am a sun I give warmth unconditionally When I smile people feel the joy I brighten up each day  I am a flower I dance the tears away to the breeze I am an eternal inner-beauty I am the reason for love and peace  I am a star I will never leave anybody alone in the dark I pray for the dreams to come true I am a prove of God's love  (and God is One Love who puts together rainbow, sun, flower and star in me)

       You're so pure and so divine    In a world colored with empty smile    Caress them with your tender heart    Put on some lights with your eyes      You were born to give others warmth    Everything about you is soothing    A deep river in every mind    A moon that shines in every night      Too many lies      Too many disappointments    Turn your soul light down    So close your eyes and see with your heart      Because you're so pure and so divine    Born to give others warmth

      (april 3, 2003)     Pretty  That pretty, young girl sings on the street  Not everybody cares to give her some money  Everybody does realize that she is…     Pretty  That pretty, young girl stands on a place  Where no pretty young girls should  It’s not her voice that attracts the street wolves  It’s her beauty, innocence, her body     Pretty, young girl,   What do you get from living on the street?  Day by day,  How much do you have to sacrifice?     Pretty, young girl pretty much degraded  Yet she worth pretty much more than that  She’s been dreaming of a hand to take her out of the street  Where she day by day sings

      in this life you have hope love that blooms on a sailing boat an open door when others are shut and a star to point out   it's where you trust your dreams shine down on you on thick and thin a star that knows you will win from the very moment that you begin    bright future is rising from afar keep the soul from fading away always let your soul lead your way raise your hand and point out a star

      How many times a day you nod  Then your heart says not  When all you listen to is your pride  Don't care what is wrong or right   Gotta trust your people  They give you compliment just a little  Save you from life's riddle  Seem to get you out of trouble   They are nice alright  Now they insist you to sacrifice  You owe them your rights  You think they've been wise   Who owns your mind and soul?  What's ever happened with no?  Don't need math in friendship  It's love and trust that you should keep

You're not alone Know yourself more Before you run Choose your destination  Love then hate Can't stand it But you keep it Be honest  Jump to it

      Don’t fall asleep, Nehanda! The night comes But don’t you surrender Don’t let it take over control  Nehanda, open your eyes! You are the strongest when you’re awake You are the author of your life story Lead to the right direction   Don’t give up the power If you close your eyes now The darkness will win It will rule your every dream  It won’t be you to choose Between sweet dream or nightmare Whether you win or lose Just play the game and you’ll lose  So keep your conscious mind Sing a song and dance along You gotta stay up For you life

      in this life is there such a place? where i can keep my secrets safe  when i cry at night, sun doesn't need to find out  in this life is there such a voice? that keeps silent though there's other choices  seeks sympathy, spoils the wounded heart   in this life no one can live alone  but if there's no one to trust   in crowd i'll be lonely  things just get harder to get  no word can be kept  in this life can't find one yet

      I don’t need to stand here in the dark Where lots of things to see Choose to be unseen  I don’t have to sit here lonely A place where joy and happiness meet With closed heart, remains silent   I don’t need to regret a thing For God is always in my heart Bigger than the universe I stand inside of Him  The rain running down my face Is inside of Him This rain wash my sins away Standing in the rain wash my tears away Inside Him, reach the rain with these fingers I feel His love, even His smile  Fall down my whole body The rain and all His blessings Because I need to stand in the light Where lots of beautiful things are there to see

      look into my eyes, take a look inside do you see the child in me? do you see my dreams? do you see the white light? I am sacred Like a house of God   You can see me laughing  when things are fun You can see me crying when I'm hurt or sad But can you see me lying? No, cos I am just a child   Dig into my soul, deep down inside do you see the child in me? can you find hatred? can you find war? No, you can only find peace Like a house of love   Hug me and I'll hug you too Say you love me  And I'll love you to the moon Can you see I'm innocent? I give unconditional love Cos I'm a child

      I thought black was the only color you got But you got plenty! With your move, paint the air so colorful and real Not only a dance, You build a life-castle with true heart    In the dark, You know exactly how bright the sunshine is You said it’s as bright as the light of my eyes How do you know? When I close my eyes, I can only see the darkness    I need to learn from you How to see clearly with my heart as you do    I thought the wind of music never blew on your side But your every move unites with every vibe Not only you dance with the music, The music becomes you, you the music    In silence, You know which bird singing which song You said one of them sound as beautiful as my voice How can you tell? When I shut my ears, I can only hear the silence    Allow me to learn from you How to hear clearly with my heart as you do    I thought only yourself can hear the voice of your soul But I can hear you, too! How many flowers you plant inside your heart? So you can wake the butterflies up with your morning chant    Without voice, You got all the melodies of all the emotions With all your senses knows which song to sing to chase the clouds away How is that possible? When I shut my mouth, don’t even know how to hum    Tell me now, How to sing out loud with my free soul as you do    Hear more music Sing more songs Dance with more colors Will I ever be just like you?

      Seeking empathy unsympathetically Hands begging, lips cold, eyes empty Young, wandering around leaving his dignity behind Sell some poverty for small amount of pity    Counting all money left in my head I don’t think so, got a bus ride to pay Keep on walking then that dire look If he only knew what my heart has given    Give him love, pray to God Give him the best a man can get Out of sorrow and depression Still he wants some more    Mo’ money so he can live today So mo’ bottles he can afford today Slave of his own way of living each day Beg for some money, rob some mo’ someday

      Sun…  Yellow!  Orange!  Bright!!  Vivid and clear…  Golden!!!  It’s a dazzling gold…  Hanging in the sky.     Sun…  Warm  Healing  Elevating  Cheering  Delighting     Every hope rises up  Every spirit encouraged  One and all look ahead  Each soul warmed      All the birds sing and so are the singers  All the flowers dance and so are the dancers  All the tears swept away with smile     Hanging in the sky is a dazzling gold  For each and every living creature on earth  From God with love     (September 19, 2003)

      I look at this man He has loved me even before I was born I am here today because of his love With his arms shelter me from the storm    I love this man He gives me life and strength to survive He lives to give me happiness The best is all that I can get    I look into this man’s eyes In his sadness he stands even taller Cos his love just shines even brighter He smiles, he gives me warmth   This man introduced me to the Great One And this love grows higher and stronger Wherever I go, whenever I chase my dreams He prayed so I’m safe in the shelter   I look at this man and look at myself I’ll make him proud just let me start No matter how far I go he’s not losing me His blessings will always keep me on the track

      From now on, time won't have to wait Too long Has this heart been longing Got to find love now  Too long have those souls tortured Day and night won't they stop tearing it all away These eyes just can't see  Day and night they kill those dreams No regret Have they murdered their own future Of happiness, power, so-called better world  No regret left when crying eyes stare Endlessly Telling them a true story of pain But those hands just won't take theirs  Endlessly dancing with the fire Burning All of smiles and highest hopes Will you touch their hearts tell them to love?  Burning white candles with warmest love From now on Sing out loud the song of love Everybody loves everybody

      There you go down on your knees  Praying for happiness you can't wait to feel  Stop the rain so I can see the rainbow.  Turn night into day cos I wanna see the sun  You can't play some funky songs  Until comes the day when you'll feel the joy  How in the world can I crack a smile,  when misery is all my heart can get?   Can we just dance now?  Choose to be happy today, not tomorrow  In this life we should take things easy  Do not delay, happiness is here already

      to close my eyes is useless cos this heart can see     to shut my ears is a dead end cos this heart can hear      and this skin can feel the thorn     caress or stab me, hurts anyway      give me a pair of wings when both feet tied to the ground     how can i even shout when mouth is shut?     if i let my soul scream would i be free?     would its power soar to heal the wound?     roots are too deep to break, would silence make any changes?      losing every priceless piece of my life     can't do what i should do

      (april 3, 2003)     How do you fit in a box?  How far would you let yourself adjust?  Don’t you have your own size?  The world is wide enough for your box to fit in     Lotsa boxes placed side by side  With different sizes  all in different different colors     Mo boxes put on top of the others  So the boxes become higher and stronger  Together, hand in hand, as one

      a little lie, a bit of sweet words  the highway he takes to win the game of world   one day with two eyes on the back of your head  one day to find out one thousand of bitter lies   cold as warm black as white fire as ice  one man smiles at you then one second stabs you   a little lie, a bit of sweet words  the highway he takes to win the game of world   he's a backstabber  backstabber he'll always be  he's a backstabber  and he'll die as one

      When your heart says no  But your ego keeps telling you to go  Don’t look front or back Down or left or right  To give your heart the strength  Look up above  Where God watches over you     Thanks, Dad for making me look inside my heart and up above.

      songs will remain so even if they left unsung will singers remain so if they stop singing?  I've seen beautiful paintings painted by beautiful hands but if they put their brush down  should I ever call them painters anymore?  countless hearts  rest within every human being but should i call him a man with a heart if he doesn't love?

      today we just need to stop look then choose what it is in ourselves that we really want to give to someone  standing in front of us  today just look beyond  find what it is inside  deep inside we are all the same these sacred souls all belong to the highest place  today notice how love has shaped every wonderful thing we feel like the one standing in front of us

        Allow yourself to close your eyes and see with your heart Hold the hands of mother nature then you'll begin to hear Something that will touch your soul Brighten up your day Lift you up no matter how deep you fall  Embrace the colors of the sound you hear Filling up the air, running inside your blood What it will give you is a divine power a soul healer, my music  Music that comes because of my love Music that enters your broken heart and fixes it up Music that speaks from my free soul A beautiful sound of me  Allow yourself to receive my love Unconditionally sharing you my joy  Listen to what I want from you Listen... Can you hear what I ever want from you? No, you can't Cos I only sing the songs of giving, Joy, peace, and happiness  Now listen again And Allow yourself to sing along with me

      it is okay if you want to see from that side telling me how boastful I am how ignorant or how reluctantly I give then I will apoligize telling you how sorry I am how could I and I should be dimming away  and I will be loving you anyway hold you as high in every way while letting you feel the presence of someone's trapped  in your own rules of game in what you think should and shouldn't do  it is okay if you want it that way then I will still be giving you as much except my true light,  true joy, true self until you set me free
