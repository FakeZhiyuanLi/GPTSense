      i was just out on my fire escape smoking a cigarette and this guy (blond, probably about thirty, not badly dressed) with a grey blanket over his shoulder is picking up rocks and throwing them around and screaming "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!" so i'm smoking and watching avidly while trying to remain discreet so he didn't notice. hiding a little behind our little lime tree even. and he loses interest in the rocks and he's off! down the street, which he crosses ("aaaaaaaaargh!") lunging at a car. when safely on the other side ("aaaaaaaaarg!!"), he thrashes his way past the little bus terminal on the sidewalk kicking at the ads. he goes past the trash barrel and then has a second thought and goes back to the can. he reaches in and pulls out a pepsi can and a green glass beer bottle ("aaaaaargghh!!") and he tosses the latter to the pavement, shattering it. he then (get this) takes a big slug off the pepsi can, and throws in back in the trash and continued ("aaaaaarhgh!!!") along the bridge. i extiguished my cigarette, climbed in the window, and was like, "what the fuck just happened?"

      the last thing i was dreaming about before i was wrenched from sleep by max calling to wake me up:&nbsp; my friend stephen was thinking about taking a class and he was looking through a course catalog, and one of the courses was called: petting zoo.

      i just found out my friend, mikey, is in jail.&nbsp; i started getting calls a few days ago a couple times a day from a computer recording that i couldn't understand the name of because it was all garbled.&nbsp;&nbsp; i was like, "i don't think i owe any money to anyone...hm."&nbsp; so, often the calls were at like 6am, and i was like, "what the fuck, who's calling me at this hour??", so i called the number back to see what was up and tell them to knock it off.&nbsp; so i find out it's some phone call place for inmates.&nbsp; and still it's not registering.&nbsp; and i finally talk to someone and they tell me that someone is trying to call my from prison.&nbsp; still not registering.&nbsp; so, then, i ask where the jail is, and they tell me billerica, ma, and i'm immediately like, "oh, fuck, what did mike do?"&nbsp; all i have to say is have you seen drugstore cowboy?

      last night ahren called me on the way home from the sci show.&nbsp; we were chatting randomly about the band and the shows (he was telling me about little friends that he made that had backpacks full of pharmies and looked, of course, like a mess.)&nbsp; so this goes on pleasantly for a few minutes and then ahren says, "can you hold on for a second?"&nbsp; and i'm like, "totally".&nbsp; and there's a pause and i hear him in the background say, "ya, i'll have a number 2".&nbsp; i was dying.&nbsp; i love the thought of ahren eating jack in the box.&nbsp; and then my phone went dead.&nbsp; so, i called him right back and was like, "dude!!&nbsp; the suspense is killing me...what did you get to drink???"&nbsp; diet coke.&nbsp; i love the concept of ordering a shitload of fast food and then getting diet coke.&nbsp; i do it all the time.&nbsp; that's how i keep my boyish figure, friends.

      so, last night max and i were playing boggle and i challenged him that ade was a word (like orange ade). &nbsp; turns out that it can't stand alone and is only a suffix (my friend jen and i had always agreed, in&nbsp;the copious games of our friendship, that it was a word.).&nbsp; but in the course of looking this up, max discovered the allure of the words at the top of the page in conjunction with each other, as they are juxtaposed serenipitously demarcating the bounardaries of what wordage is contained on the page.&nbsp; we started considering how the words could be related (in a scene or something) and of course we got laughing our proverbial asses off.&nbsp; some of our most favored pairings:&nbsp; schnozzle-scientific method; leopard seal-lethal; vagina-validate; and imprompu-inactivity.&nbsp; i took it one step further, suggesting that this would be a great way to generate a scene in an improv show.&nbsp; ah, flights of fancy...the imagination is a glorious place.   &nbsp;

      also, yesterday, i got what i believe to be my first call from a show (but my memory is shit).&nbsp; amy called me from moe. at the hampton casino ballroom.&nbsp; brent black.&nbsp; i was dancing in my living room with an idiotic smile on my face with the phone pressed to my head and max looking at me quizzically.

      last night my friend francisco (who works in computer animation)&nbsp;told me that he and this other guy i know are working on a pilot about a monkey.&nbsp; they're doing the whole thing themselves and are going to try to sell it to cartoon network or comedy central.&nbsp; so i guess (obviously) this monkey has a russian accent, and yesterday they were starting to think about dubbing what they'd already created.&nbsp; and francisco and the other guy (chris) were the only ones who volunteered to try to give a russian-accented voice to the monkey in question.&nbsp; what interested me was that he was telling me that he discovered through a series of takes how difficult it is to make the recording sound animated and engaging.&nbsp; he said that he'd think he was way way overacting, and then he'd listen to it and think it sounded flat.&nbsp; somewhere in the middle of this, they started drinking.&nbsp; francisco had a few shots and loosened up a little, but still wasn't pleased with how it was coming out.&nbsp; but apparently chris got pretty drunk and just brought it!&nbsp; be the russian monkey.&nbsp; ohm.&nbsp; so,&nbsp;my conclusion, of course, is that having a russian accent is less a function of being russian&nbsp;than it is being drunk.&nbsp; and that, children, is how russian people got their accents.&nbsp; the end.

      this, the inaugural post on my blogster, will be devoted to my new love in life: string cheese.&nbsp; i just wanted to say that i am a complete asshole for never having gone to one of their shows before tuesday.&nbsp; hot things about the show:&nbsp; the venue.&nbsp; the warfield absolutely rules.&nbsp; it is an old theater on market st., beautifully preserved, complete with awesome seraphine ceiling paintings, and curtains&nbsp;framing the stage.&nbsp; unlike the orpheum, however, the smart people who refurbished this place when it became a place for shows, pulled the seats out!&nbsp; hot.&nbsp; plenty of room for dancing!&nbsp; the balcony still has seats, and i chilled there second set last night, which was rad, because i could actually see the band.&nbsp; and the balcony, all of my orpheum-going friends, doesn't feel like it's going to fall into the orchestra section under the weight of the grooving crowd.&nbsp; all and all:&nbsp; impressive.&nbsp; secondly: the band.&nbsp; these guys synthesize alot of elements from different genres and make it sound so groovy.&nbsp; i especially love the bluegrass influence.&nbsp; i danced my ass off both nights!&nbsp; word.  in other news from the show excursions:&nbsp; there was a little lot scene going on on the fucking sidewalk on market street.&nbsp; how cute is that?&nbsp; the usual stuff.&nbsp; there was a guy playing fiddle during set break&nbsp;and of course there were hippies dancing.&nbsp; someone also sold me a cold newcastle on the sidewalk.&nbsp; there was even&nbsp;some grilled cheese action.&nbsp; lot scene without the lot.&nbsp; leave it to the hippies.  oh, and on the way home last night:&nbsp; a dude tried to sell me crack at 16th and mission.&nbsp; he asked me like 6 times, as if every time i said no, i wasn't sure about it or something.&nbsp; i'm pretty sure i don't look like a crack head.&nbsp; correct me if i'm wrong.&nbsp; and dude, it was awesome.

      i walked past a newspaper vending machine on the street today and a headline peeked out at me:  50 scary hours: mission residents fear gang problem may be gett ing worse.  and, being the twisted individual that i am, my first thought was not:  shit, that's terrible, but: dude, gang violence is so early 90s.

      eating my turkey sandwich on the sidewalk, i give into the capricious urge to feed a cute little birdie a bitty piece of my bread crust. i think to myself, "isn't that amusing that i still have that little kid urge to feed birds?" then, bird two comes on the scene. he is the same kind of bird as bird one and the same size. he looks at bird two inquisitively as he tries to look all innocent, like, "oh, hey what've you got there, friend?", when it's obvious that he didn't come down to socialize but because he wanted in on the bread action. bird one, any of his naivite about bird two's intentions shattered after he steps over the line and attempts to wrest the bread in question, hops off behind a car tire and out of my view. i continue to eat my sandwich, forgetting about the birds momentarily. until both of them come back into view, bird two still hot on the trail of his bread-hoarding buddy. i'm pretty amused that i've "taken the object and started the game", that i have been the impetus for this melodrama. but this amusement cannot compare to the amusement i feel when a pigeon drops in on the quarrel. mr. pigeon looks positively massive compared to his new-found companions/adversaries, and as i observe, he moves slower...but he has the size factor covered, which makes him intimidating to bird one and bird two. it's shaping up to be quite a cage match. so bird one and two squabble over the bread while mr. p. slowly plods along behind them like frankenstein, and the formers just keep one step ahead constantly fleeing the big man. so, then, not content with merely watching what i had created by adding only one variable to the situation, i contrive to add a second. what if i feed bird two and piece of bread when he momentarily loses interest in fighting with bird one? if i throw a piece of bread further away than is convenient to get to, how will this effect the drama? is bird two's bread lust be strong enough to fight his potential laziness? in short, i was fucking with these birds. i was starting conflict and sitting back to watch. hey...and...i was FEEDING them. they were hungry and i was just trying to help them out...and...hey stop looking at me that way.

      so, yesterday, when i hit up the little convenience store hole-in-the-wall in the lobby of my building to buy smokes on my way home, i asked for my standard (as of late) camel lights (funny thing, my cigarette brand swings, this is my third switch this year. i went from camels to marlboro lights (i don't even like them, what was i thinking?) because they were like 15 cents cheaper and i was THAT poor, ok? and that madness lasted a year, and then to american spirits for a bit when i moved to sf, and now (thank god) back to camel lights.) and the lady told me they had either 100s (which are actually called 99s when camel makes them, because they are so innovative i can't stand it) or soft pack. although i have bought them several times under similar duress, i think the latter is just an asstastic idea. so let me get this straight...are these for the adventurous types who run with scissors? (i just paid 5 bucks for this pack of cigarettes and i like the dangerous feeling of the increased risk that they're all going to be crushed like a car at a junkyard. i live dangerously.), or the rich people? (i just paid 5 bucks for this pack of cigarettes, but if they get squooshed, i'll just by another one.) the dilemma in this case was not a dilemma at all, and like the sensible gal we all know me to be, i picked the "99s". the woman at the register rang it up: $4.95. right on...hand her a five...collect my changedoggies and go. i go out and light one up because i am the queen of instant gratification, and a thought hits me: i just got more cigarette for my money. the 100s are the same price as the regular cigarettes. the stirrings of a second thought played freeze tag in my head for an instant. considering that getting more always means paying more in every other instance i could think of, is it actually true that this is a chance to nickel-and-dime consumers that has been overlooked by cig big wigs? oh, shit, i hope nobody working for marlboro is reading this blog or there goes what may be the last outpost of non-assfuckery by corporate america.
