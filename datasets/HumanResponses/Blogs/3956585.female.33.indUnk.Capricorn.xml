						    &nbsp; He and I meet quite strangely. I watched his program on cable and thought it was great. I thought he was great. Handsome, intelligent, creative, funny, will to put himself on the line for his beliefs. When they said there was a website fans could go to and comment about the show; I thought, Why not? I had some things to say.   I had never posted on that kind of site before but that was OK.   &nbsp;  I posted there. I made some friends. We had fun. It was a while before I realized that he was posting there too but incognito. When he made himself known to me, I was surprised and thrilled. We began a dance. Posting back and forth. Playing games.    &nbsp; Unfortunately someone else caught on to us. This someone was not so nice. A hacker/stalker of sorts with an aim to make money. This someone I call "little hacker dude" began be trying to impersonate my Sweet Boy to me. Telling me things that were untrue to hurt me. It worked. I e-mailed Sweet Boy and little hacker dude hacked my e-mails. He got the personally info I sent Sweet Boy. Little hacker dude then began a campaign of terror. Threatening to hurt or kill me unless Sweet Boy gave him money. I was shocked that something like this could be taking place. Quite rightly Sweet Boy refused. He worked to have little hacker dude removed or ban from the site. It was impossible. We were stuck with little hacker dude.    &nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Boy and I continued our relationship despite little hacker dude's efforts to make us miserable. Sometimes we made each other miserable. Misinterpretations we called they. One of us or even both of us would become angry and walk away from the computer. But we always came back, he and I. We made codes and found other ways to talk without little hacker dude figuring it out for a while.    &nbsp;&nbsp;I left and went to visit my family for a short time, but we still talked every day. When I returned to my apartment Sweet Boy let me know that he had had a surveillance camera placed outside my building to protect me from the threats little hacker dude had made. It was unneeded as protection. It became for watch me himself. We both went to work everyday and everyday we talked.    &nbsp; Somewhere through all this I fell madly in love with him and he with me. I never been in love with someone before or at least not like this. How do you explain to someone that they are perfect to you? I walk in shadows everyday we are not together. Living only a half-life. He is my other half. I am incomplete without him.    &nbsp; I love you with all my heart Sweet Boy...
