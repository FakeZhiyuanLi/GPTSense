      Emerson mills was an old mill that got transformed into apartments, my husband picked the crappiest town up near the state capitol, which is Concord. He had gotten a job working on the prisons computer system, so we moved into this place because it was the cheapest place around, only 525.00 a month, not bad huh? We moved in New Years Eve, with the help of some of my husband's friends. It only took 4 hours, by midnight we were done, and sleeping.  When we moved in I liked the place because of it's high ceilings, and enormous windows, and the feel of it was great. Little did I know the feeling would soon dissipate over time. I have to go so I will finish this blog later.

      Our flight was long, and horrible, I was breastfeeding my son the whole time, and he barely ate, so I was wicked engorged. The flight was a total of 8 hours, we had to land in Boston, at Logan airport. Then we had a to get on a bus and have them drive us up to NH. I was so exhausted I just wanted to go to bed. So instead of going right to my in-laws house, we end up going to my husband's grandmother's house, and I end up falling asleep there and so on. Eventually we do end up at my Mother-in-laws, and we crash for the night, or for me a few hours before my son got up.   We stayed at my in-laws for approximately 2 months we got there 2 weeks before Halloween, and left New years Eve. During the stay I did however encounter spirits. My mother-in-law and father-in-law decided to tell me about them. They were two sisters who owned the house and the land. They were still in the house. They remember when they were buying the house and started getting in workers to fix some problems in the house, how some workers refused to go into a certain room, in which we were sleeping. My Father-in-law who worked in NY, had a friend who knew a friend that was psychic, and he met her and told her about the workers, so she asked him to bring in something from the house, and she could give him a reading. So he brought in a door handle. She held onto it, and told him about the sisters, how they liked them, but hated their cats. They liked my Mother-in-law because she didn't want to change much in the house. She said other stuff, but unfortunately I forgot what it was.  There was this one time that my mother-in-law and father-in-law, had to go out and get their furniture for their house, so they left with the cats in thouse. An hour later they came back, and found all of the doors closed and locked, and the only way someone could do that was with a key, that they had on them. So they thought the ghosts were angry with them for some reason, so my mother-in-law started looking for her cats, and couldn't find them, she started panicking. My father-in-law started looking as well, they ended up finding all 4 cats in one of the closets, and the closet door was locked. So, to this day my mother-in-law doesn't like elaving her cats alone for very long.  So after I heard these stories I was a little freaked out, they assured me that the ghosts were no longer there, and I had nothing to be afraid of. Well I had my own little encounter before we moved. It was around Christmas time, I was up at night getting my son his nightly bottle. Whenever I had to go downstairs in that house to warm a bottle up, I made sure I left a trail of lights behind me, so I wouldn't be afraid, and I could find my way back easily. So one night I had left my trail of lights, and was warming his bottle up, no one had gotten up, or I would have heard. I did get a creepy sensation I was being watched, but figured it was just paranoia. When the bottle was done I grabbed my son and the bottle, and started back the way I came everything was fine until I reached the stairs, I noticed the light and all of the other lights were turned off, so I turn on each one to find my way back upstairs and in my room, I had never been so scared in my life. The next morning I told my in-laws and my father-in-law thought maybe they were saying hello. Three weeks after that odd happening we moved into Emerson Mills.

      So anyhow, the summer of my senior year I met different people, my friend got a boyfriend his name was Jack, we also met Eddie, whom was ok, but I think he really liked me, he also married, and had a kid, nice guy huh?  So once we started school, Eddie's wife Beth moved to Germany with their daughter, so Yvonne and I started hanging out with her a lot, on weekends, every Friday, and she went bar hopping with us as well, (legal drinking age in Germany is 16, I was 18 going on 19) I also found out that Eddie and Beth were Pagans, they practiced magic and worshipping their gods and goddesses. I found that very interesting, and she got me book on wicca, in which I read but never practiced. So anyhow, one day I was in her apartment, we were smoking, and such, and we got on the subjects of ghosts. Yvonne and I told her about what happened at my apartment and her apartment. Beth then said, "I have a ghost too." I was like yeah right. She said I do it's like to play with my daughter's toys, so I said prove it! She got up and went into her daughter's room and took out her toy box. I was like what are you doing, all she said was,"wait." So we waited for like 15 minutes, then i did the I have to go to the bathroom trick. I looked in her daughter's room and two toys were taken out. I went screaming back to them saying it happened. When we all came back to look all of the toys were taken out of the box, it was so strange to me. I never doubted her again.  A few months later I get a call from Beth and she asks me to watch her child, I was like ok, then after I hung up I remembered the ghost. So I started getting a little worried, but then again I promised her. When I arrived I saw the little girl, and Beth told me what she liked to do and so on. After, I played with her daughter, and changed her and gave her a snack, then I wagon told to put her down, I did, and she didn't cry or anything. As I was sitting there, I was a little freaked, I felt a presence around me, but I was like I couldn't move. I started to watch TV, and the arms on my hair started raising up. Then I felt cold, this lingered for 30 minutes, then it left andnI began to feel at ease, 15 minutes later it came back, then I heard some noises in the little girls room I went to go check on her, and saw her toys were out of the box. Soon after Beth came backand said I could go home now, she gave 10 bucks for watching her daughter. I told her what had happened , she said I may be sensitive, and not to worry about it, it won't hurt me. I went home, but never babysat again. I told her I couldn't handle the ghost. Her child was fine but the other thing worried me.  to end this story, I graduated High School, met my husband , got married, and we had our first child in Germany. Before I had my son, I ran into Beth, and she said everything was great and she expecting again. I asked about her ghost and she said more had entered her apartment. She said one guy was watching her child and he was on her computer, he felt like a earthquake, only centered around a picture, when he looked at the picture it had changed, and she has felt more then one ghost in her apartment, and she was looking for a good banishing spell to get rid of them, I wished her luck, and left. So, after we had my son, we moved to here NH. I'll post about my NH stories tomorrow. Later.

      Where was I? Oh yeah I told my Mom what was going on how I was hearing voices and such, and she told me there had to be a reasonable explanation for it all, so she went into my room and sat there, I didn't hear anything either, so we both blew it off, and I was certain it was in my head.   When I went to school my friend asked how everything went, and I said ,"Everything is fine now." She said,"Good because I got rid of it." Then we headed to class.  After all of this I decided to spend the night at her house, we did our usual, sat chatted , watched boring movies at tons of junk food, then we decided to head for bed. She failed to tell me that when she tried to banish this ghost it was for my house not hers. So, we were in her room talking, and she said ,"Oh my god, watch out!" Just as I ducked a glass figurine smashed against the wall. I was like,"What was that?" She said,"It was the ghost." I then asked her why it was here and why she didn't get rid of it like she said. She was confused she didn't know. The rest of the night was peaceful.  The conclusion of this particular story, the entity lingered around for awhile but eventually left on it's own. She didn't talk about it after that night. That's it.

      So in October of 1991 we headed to Germany, the flight was long and horrendous, we were so glad to get to Germany yet so tired. Germany is about 8 hours ahead of the east coast, and 10 hours ahead in the west coast. So we were about 10 hours ahead of our normal time. My step-father was nice enough not to enroll in High School right away, he let me get used to the different time zones, for about a week, thankfully. Lets be honest here to tell you the truth for about 1 whole year I hated Germany, it took me a year to not get picked on, to make friends, and get used to the Germans. As much as I love Germany, I couldn't stand it. I had tried writing back home to my supposed friends, they never wrote me back, in which case I wrote them hate letters, in which there was no reply. So I decided to make new friends in Germany. Now I know what your thinking and I've been asked it many times, did I go to a German school? Nope I went to an American school on a military base. It wasn't the greatest school, but hey what were you gonna do?  Anyhow, in my sophomore year, I met Yvonne, she was alright, honestly I didn't like her at first but then she turned out to be ok. I knew her for about 6 months, when I found out she was interested in Satanism. It sort freaked me out because I never wanted to mess with the stuff, and all I had to do was watch the Exorcist and I was all set. Well anyway after she into Satanism, she said one night she was reading her Satanic bible (by the way I told her never to read it in front of me because I would get bad vibes from it) she heard something behind her, and when she turned around she said she saw this shadow lookinbg thing in front of her. She called it a demon, she said when she looked at it , it disappeared into a wall. Every night when she would go to bed, she would see it coming into her, and looking at her. I could tell she was scared but insisted it was no big deal. So she tried getting rid of it, and she did the worse thing ever, she sent the fucking hinge over to my house.  yes, that's exactly what she did, but I didn't find this out, until after everything had happened. One night I came home from her house, and was getting ready for bed, that's when I heard my name being called out "Jessica, Jessica, Jessica" I turned around and saw nothing, it kept going on"Jessica, Jessica, Jessica" When I went to bed that night, I kept hearing it over and over. I eventually fell asleep , holding my ears, and crying because I couldn't stop my name from being called. I didn't tell anyone, not even my friend, I didn't think she would believe, until one night. My Mom had to work late, she was working at an Army surplus store on post, and my step-father was TDY in the USA, he was going to school, to train for something. So it just my Mom and I, for a couple of weeks. Anyhow, I got home from school, and it was getting dark, my Mom said not to worry about making dinner she would do it when she got home, well she didn't get home til 6pm that night. Anyhow, so it was winter of course, got dark early, and I was listening to the rqdio, during that time our TV had broken, so all we had was the radio. Well everything was fine, I didn't hear my name being called out and I was relaxing and doing homework. The radio was on, all of a sudden I heard static, I looked up and the tuner had been changed. I thought it weird and changed it back. Then a few minutes later I heard static again, I was getting a little freaked out, and changed it back, then right in front of my eyes the turner changed again, only this time it went quickly from one channel to the next and landed back on the station I had it on. I then decided to turn the radio off, I went to go sit down and it turned on by itself. I freaked out and ran called my friend. I told her what had happened, and asked if I could go over to "study". She said no problem and told me to come over immediately. So I ran to my room and got my stuff, and went over to her house. While I was there I told her and her mom what had happened, and they believed me and were shocked. My friend then pulled me aside and told me what she had done, she was going to fix the problem. I had asked her how and she told me not to worry about it. She had sent this ghost over to my house, thinking, first of all it wouldn't work, and secondly it was supposed to be a pratical joke. I told her to fix and thanks a lot.  So I headedhome, and got there 5 minutes before my Mom did. I still felt something there and asked it to leave several times, I was so scared, I was crying, my Mom came in the door hearing me screaming for it to leave me alone. She asked what was going, so I decided to tell what had been happening to me for about a week, and I will tell you the rest of the story tomorrow, I have to go now.

      So where was I, Oh yeah went to Arizona with my Mom and step-father, I encountered another ghostlty incident at the same bar in Bisbee. We always went to the same bar almost every weekend, it's what my parents liked to do, they were bar people. Anyhow, we were there alone again, and I had to go to the bathroom again, so I went. Everything went fine I didn't hear anything weird, I stepped out of the stall and was washing my hands fixing myself basically, and the lights went out on me. I was almost frozen in fear so I called out to my step-father, and the minute I said "Pat!" The lights went back on. I went back to the bar, and told my Mom and Pat and the bartender what had happened, the bartender then told they have a ghost here. I was like yeah right.  (I was still skeptical of ghosts at the time, wanted to believe, but was told by my own Mother they were not real. I blocked out what had happened to me in Michigan, so as a teenager I never knew what happened there, just something not good. I found out about what really happened to me when I was 21, but I will get to that later.)  They guy insisted that it was a female ghost, this ghost supposedly liked the men but was jealous of females. He thinks she played a trick on me because she was jealous of me, so she turned the light off. That was all. We lived in Arizona for about a year, my step-father was in the military, so he got assigned to go to Germany. October of 1991 we headed to Germany.

      My name is Jessica, I am a 27 year old female, I am married with 3 children. For all most of my life I have been dealing with ghosts and now aliens. This had all started when I was around six years old. I had lived in a haunted house for about a month with my Mom and her boyfriend, somewhere in Michigan. It was then I saw my very first ghost and witnessed first hand polgergist activity. I saw lights flickering off and on, things being moved on their own, and my first apparation. Let me explain about the house, my mother dating this guy, lets call him Mike who dragged us to Michigan, we met his parents, Father was very nice, the Mother was off her gord. A week later there was a tragedy, Mike's Mother had supposedly shot her husband then herself, apparently she was not well in the head. After a week of them cleaning up the mess, and my mother and I staying at Mike's Aunt's house, we moved into his parent's house. Why we did this I have no idea, my Mother can't even tell my why. So the apparation I saw was Mike's mother, she was white, see through and a few feet off of the ground, and was floating from the kitchen, where she shot her husband, into the living room area. I had talked with my Mom about the strange things going on in that house as an adult, she told me she saw the same apparation, and it scared her so bad she left with cigarette burning in an ash tray. We stayed for about a month, which was all we could handle, and moved back to Colorado Springs, where I stayed with her for 4 years afterwards, then I moved in with my Father.  I didn't really exeprience much ghostly activity with him at his house and so on, but I did encounter strange things at friend's houses and so on. I had one friend who had a shadow person in her house, everytime I would go over it would act up, do something to make sure everyone knew it was there. Like turning on toys, the TV and even music. Nothing negative became of the experiences, even though a year after being there they moved, and my friend insisted it was because of the ghosts, which weren't really ghosts but demons. I still have a hard time believing that.  As I got older more stuff began happening, especially when I moved back in with my Mom, I lived in Arizona for about a year, I only had one encounter with a ghost in Bisbee. I remember my parents took me to a bar, I was not aloud to sit at the bar because I was 14 but I could be in the bar, and have cokes and Shirley temples and so on. So I remember one time I had to go to the bathroom, and I went in and I actually heard someone coming in, and I thought it was my Mom so I started talking to it, and when I was done I got out of my stall and looked into hers and saw no one there, a few seconds later my Mom walked in and I was like how did you do that she was like did what, I told her I heard someone come in, I asked if anyone had left the bathroom, she said no, we were the only ones in the bar. I just thought it was bizarre.  Anyhow, I have more stories but I do have to go so later, and thanks for letting me introduce myself.
