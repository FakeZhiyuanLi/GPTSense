      My mean fiance told me that my blog would be really boring -- filled with going to Walmart, feeding my cats, eating at Wendy's.&nbsp;   I have a little more going on.&nbsp; First, I'm marrying him.&nbsp; Second, I'm moving to Florida and finding a new job there.&nbsp;  Saturday, my best friend/matron of honor and I are picking up my wedding dress.&nbsp; It's gorgeous!&nbsp; I'll post pictures later.  I'd write more, but I have to go feed my cats.

      "Do you want me to tell you something really subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. . . . It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more."--  Lido Anthony "Lee" Iacocca (b. 1924)   I'm in love and getting married --- something I didn't would happen to me.   I am not even really anxious about messing it up -- it just is and I accept it.  This is definitely different for me!

      I couldn't wait for success, so I went ahead without it.   urlLink Jonathan Winters   I had a Pecan-Crusted Chicken Salad at lunch today at Friday's.  I have no idea how many points / calories that is!   This is what I do -- obsess.  Obsess over what I eat, how much I exercise, etc instead of what really matters.  I need to move and get ready for my new life in Flordia!  I have less than five months!  Right now all I care about is how many points that salad was and do I have any Flexpoints left!

        "I'm not afraid to compete. It's just the opposite. Don't you see that? I'm afraid I will compete- that's what scares me. That's why I quit the Theater Department. Just because I'm so horribly conditioned to accept everybody else's values, and just because I like applause and people to rave about me, doesn't make it right. I'm ashamed of it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody. I'm sick of myself and everybody else that wants to make some kind of a splash."

      My fiance lives in Tampa.  He went to Gainesville and stayed in a hotel with his boys to avoid Hurricane Charley.   He's stays really calm and is blase about most things.  We compliment each well.  I get really upset over little things.
