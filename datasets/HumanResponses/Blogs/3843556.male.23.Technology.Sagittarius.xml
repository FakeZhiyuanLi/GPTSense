       &nbsp;&nbsp; When something is forbidden, the greater is the urge to explore. Studying in a all boys boarding school not only forbids but also deprives us of the several god given pleasures of life. So now the little devil that is within wakes up. He wants a tatse of everything that would bring about pleasure. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     We at Montfort were no angels. We were the typical teenage boys. Among the many things that shook our curiosity was the beauty of women(let me keep this as clean as possible). We boys at Montfort did not miss out on a single chance to experience this GOD given gift. Heyy, comon it wasn't us who said opportunities don't come knocking at your door.&nbsp; We jus follow what our forefathers have asked us to do. Yes, so do the events that follow(comon what do boys of the 12-17 know..)   &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a February afternoon in 1998. Considering the fact that I was in my 12th grade..hmmm.. we were all seated in class supposedly studying. The school is extremely generous when they give a whole 3 months to study...errr did I say  study??(studyin' is not among the top priorities for Montfortians). A good afternoon's lunch combined with a sultry afternoon is better than a Jill Kelly or Brianna Banks singing you a lullaby. Yes, it was a perfect afternoon until someone decided to break the party. An angry voice roared, "All those who have obscene books & magazines turn them in". It was frenchie as always tryin' to throw his weight around us. Not a hair moved. We had this blank loooks on our faces. Damnnn, we were good yo(lol)..I knew we should've auditioned for one of those award winning films..hmmm nevermind.   &nbsp;&nbsp; The whole school was in chaos and here we were acting like we didn't know a thing. A major scam was unearthed which I called the "Porno Scam". It all started with this ultimate nut-job in 7th grade complaining to his warden that his friend(Rohan) had a copy of "Fantasy" because of a small tiffle between them. From time immemorial, we have safely passed on those sacred books down to our successors. Now there was this traitor who had broken the circle of trust. Poor Rohan was put through ultimate pain but the porn boy...ooops i mean poor boy didn't part with the information that lead to our secret for decades. All good things come to an end and so he did succumb and told them the whole truth. He had got the books from his team mates(9th grade) during a basketball tournament. &nbsp;The investigation team began their rounds of raids and interrogations. The 8th & 9th grade dorms were sealed and searched.   Now what I can't stop laughing at was the so called search team. The team involved a few a few male staff and Brothers(my school as run by Christian missionaries).. 6 of them on a whole. Credit needs to be given to the school for they had chosen the right people for the job for all 6 of them were the ultimate "accused" f*#%#@ It would be difficult to judge who would compete better with Peter North. The kids in 8th grade had beaten the 9th graders by a fairly large margin taking into account the number and variety of the sacred books they possessed. Sacred books would include playboy, debonair, fantasy,local  books, erotic story book...(there was always plenty to choose from). The guys in 10th got lucky as they weren't in school. &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;

       A few days ago during one of our drunken revelries I got this rare oppurtunity to learn something no one else knew about Kabali, a very good friend of mine. We are so similar that we would look like mirror images of the other. We started of with a couple of beers and then vodka which was followed by a few shots of tequilla. Knowing my capacity, I played the game slow. A few hours and yessss, our special guest of the night Rev.Kabali was all ready to unleash upon the world few of his hidden thoughts.   Kabs grew up in Madras. He spent a few years away from madras cuz of his schooling but nevertheless returned back to Madras where his heart felt close to home. He later came to the US to pursue his masters. He has loved his life all along. He made friends everywhere he went and nobody could ever not like this guy. He has had his ups & downs in life but nothing could change the fact that he loved every bit of it.   His roots are from Kerala. A small village close to Guruvayoor was where his ancestors lived. But then a few decades ago his grandparents decided to leave Kerala and move to Madras for good. A decision that Mr.K would thank his grandparents for  the rest of his life. I wondered what the big deal was. Well, I did get it after his detailed account on what his life could have been. An interesting piece it is...chatambi govindan vs. funky k-Dawg   Chatambi Govindan was named govindan kutty by his parents. He could have been anything from saju,siju,biju to gopu,achu. He spent the younger days of his life running around half naked in the lush green paddy fields and the vast stretch of banana plantations. He walked to school everyday singing songs and exchanging exciting stories about his cows with his friends. He grew up on fresh milk. He was such a "sucker" for milk that it go into him straight from the cow. Naa, you fools in the city bother way too much about boiling it and stuff. I know my 'lakshmi' gives the best milk. Safer then your fat city cows...Hmmmm what can we say??? Our city boy Kabs grew up playing with the few toys that were given to him. His favourite toy would be what he called "chaii papam"(which was a tiny tricyle). His early attempts to walk very extremely painful. Every step he took, he fell "thhuddd" on the concrete floor. Not to mention the ammmmmmmaaaaaaaaa that followed. He travelled to school on a rickshaw with four other girls(damnnnn.. lucky son o' $%*&amp;#). He would lie to them through his nose. Tales of how he was superman and spiderman and what not. And what do you think, the stupid gals bought every bit of his bullshit. Milk to Kabs was like poison. But with a touch of boost or bournvita it went straight from yuck to yummmy.   Govindan grew up quick into this energetic teen. But then, all the youthful energy was spent for causes other than good. He had his first taste of kallu aka arack at the age of 14. To complement it he also developed a new found love for dinesh beedi. He loved his lungi and singing romantic songs from tree tops was his speciality. The girls of his town dreaded him. He was already charged with 4 counts of ever-teasing. On the other hand city boy Kabs was deprived of such worldy pleasures. He went to this Christian school where he was being moulded into a gentleman. Kabs hardly got to see girls. He studied in a all boys school and the few women he did get to see were atleast three times his age. He then had no choice but to resort to helping himself. There wasn't a day in his life where he had forgotten to thank GOD almighty for the good things in life like debonair, fantasy and playboy. He now fully understood the meaning of the proverb "Self help is the best help". He had this HUGE crush on this gal which never came close to materializing. Gov on the other hand had no such worries. Emotional attachement was taboo in the world of G.   G-Man dropped out of school after three failed attempts in 10th grade. He was the prominent figure in every strike that swept mallu land for the years to come. Mr.K on the other hand went on to do his engineering. He made many new friends, which  included many many girls. All the girls thought he was a sweetheart( little did they know of the other side of him). Don't blame the poor kid. He was after all making up for all those lost years. He had big plans of flying to the US. At last Mr.K had a girl friend who went by the name of Thirupura Sundari aka sundeli(which means little rat & he called her so with affection). Every other person who knew him thought they looked like a horse and a donkey being brought together(ps:The k-man says he will play the donkey...nice guy, how can you not like him). But the two of them enjoyed every bit of their new found love. Their favourite spots were the nearby temple, pallavan or an ocassional movie or COFFEE DAY or T.Nagar(what were they thinkin'..didn't they find better places..sighhh). He even received generous offers to two-time but good old K decided otherwise(wat a loser huh). Years rolled by and it was time for Kabs to fly out to the US. Kabs was soon to become da K-Dawg (wtf is that????). He ended up breaking up with sundeli due to irreconcilable differences, details of which they refuse to divulge fearing they would lose their privacy(the effect hollywodd can have on the common man). G-Man was by now the hottest property in town for all the wrong reasons. He had tasted all the evil pleasures life had to offer(K envies him to the core). He was only 20 but was already the proud owner of Kalyani Kutty Wines(that was to keep his distant aunt happy...her daughter was what he calls "a work of art by god"). She was probably the only bootiful girl who had not fallen into his net. His had very exciting business plans which drew the attention of many venture capitalists. A club(like the ones you get to see in mallu films where all the bad guys play cards and half naked women dancing),mutton stall, ganja and ofcourse his own political party were a few to mention.   Ufff..after all these years of struggle, K-Dawg(that is what he calls himself now) was in the land oppurtunity. No more of Coffee day, T.Nagar or Pallavan. K would only visit bars, pubs, clubs and not to forget the strip clubs. He like G-Man began building on his list of names. He moved on from Jenna(not Jameson) to Monique to Chinky Lee to Jigisa Patel while G had his lekshmi,ammu,ladhiga,kunjama..etc. He had a big heart and never did he discriminate. If you were short of love all you had to do was visit K-Dawg. He was the universal symbol of true love and byooty. His tastes in music included Pachas Cent, M&amp;M and Snoop da Kutha. Our G-Man on the other hand was the same. He still loved his kallu(Black Label &amp; Old Monk made him throw up..now that is what you call a true indian). The last few years had transformed into a super-hero. He got anything he wished for(including kalyani kutty's daughter). He was a regular to all the poorams in the state. His usual line being "Eda Josapa, nammaluku poorathilu ithiri shine cheeyanam". And yeah, not to forget he was also the favourite to win the next election. It had taken him years of hard work and he had finally qualified. 3 murder charges, 7 rapes, 11 robberies(which includes 4 banks)were a few to mention. Here was K-dawg attending interviews and negotiating his compensation in terms of 50 and 60k and there was G-Man negotiating 15k for the left hand and 25k for the right hand. If you wanted to pack the guy straight to heaven he would for no less than 50k (he also had board that read rates are subjected to change without notice). So who is ur man..K-Man or G-man?? Let me know.

       Those who consider Chennapattinam their home would agree with me on this posting. There have been several times when I have sat their wondering why I still lived in this #$%^&amp;*# city. But every single time I did that I found several reasons to what makes MADRAS(doesn't this sound better than Chennai) the best place to live in. My days began at 5:30 although I would be battling until 6:00. That extra 30 minutes of sleep is close to being in heaven. But there was always a reason to spoil my early morning sleep. My grandfather would blare the speakers at 5:30. They might have been religious songs but then for christ's sake this poor little boy is making up for going to bed at 2 in the morning. I would be half asleep but would be singing along to the tunes of pullanguzhal oodhum....or Pallikattu Sabari Malaikku Kallum Mullum Kaalukku Methai. For people who weren't happy with what was playing at home, they always had the loud speakers blaring at the temple. If you still were not happy with the music visit your local tea shop where they spin old MGR and Gemini songs. Anyway, so much for my lovely sleep. Where in the world would you find these many options for a wake up call?? Only in the land of Madras.    The next big thing to look forward to in Madras is the early morning traffic. I loved my rides to college. My heart would be in my mouth until I reached college. My bus driver drove like he was driving us straight to hell. However the early morning traffic is the prime thing. If you are lucky&nbsp; you also get the favourite greeting of a Chennaite, wothhaa dei(the 'w' gives it a little more emphasis). Another one of those favourite quotes of a Madras driver that you can't miss in the morning is "saavu grakhi..vootula soltu vantiya.. bemani". Now my morning is complete. The rest of the day is just gonna run perfect. Those who actually happen to miss their ride to work have a fun morning at the auto stand. The auto drivers are terrific. They don't miss out on the point that the cost of gasoline had risen 7 months ago nor do they forget to mention that OPEC is gonna hike the price up in the months to come. Their expertise also extends to the field of electronics. The auto-meter has been improvized to show higher meter readings. An achievement that has not been matched by any of their compatriots from the other cities. Woow, can you boast of such learned men in your town. Well, I can!!!     People from these parts of the woods are hard working(We sweat it out everyday). We have three seasons..hot, hotter &amp; hottest(thank god we didn't have anythin' more than the superlative degree.. ufff). A landmark in Madras that every Chennaite is proud of is the holy river Coovum. It has served us relentessly. Never short of supply & provides us with such an aromatic experience. Your life as a Chennaite would be incomplete without a pilgrim to the holy banks of the coovam. Its stench takes your breath away. It is so powerful that it could pack someone to heaven if he is living his last days.     Madras moulds you into a world class conservationist. We&nbsp; have no choice but to live with meager supply of water. From the time I can remember, we have always bought water for our daily needs. I also made visits to the street pump to ease our water problems. The cat fights that go on at the water pump are the best of their kind. If water pumping was ever made an Olympic sport, we the men of Chennai would sweep it all. Don't leave the women out of it. The men would go nowhere without them. The $#%$#%$#%%$ is soothing to the ear when you are pumping water. You could see anything from a mere quarrel(filled with pleep pleeps) to bloodshed. Had the police pay frequent visits to my street. Can your city boast of such things..I bet not.     The youth of Chennai would do anything to impress. For some reason they fancy the almighty MTC(formerly known as Pallavan). MTC is the local bus service. Irrespective of the number of buses that are always full. Needless to say the heroes of Madras fancy them. It gives them the opportunity to not only exhibit their acrobatic stunts but also their romantic talents. Having traveled on them myself I wouldn't blame the boys for it. The girls are no angels and give the boys every reason to do so. Let us not delve deep into that for now. Could  write pages on that. So that is the orasal &amp;&nbsp; idithal that goes on in MTC. Why would you ever wanna miss out out on that. Would you??     My posting would go incomplete if I don't pay special tribute to the lingo of Madras. It has transformed tamil into a super-power language. When you swear in tamil, it gives you the feeling of a super hero. A feeling that cannot be matched when you swear in English or Hindi or any other language for that matter, for it sounds extremely gross. People here are so creative that they come up with new words and phrases all the time. What we speak in Madras is not Tamil. It is on a league of its own. I miss my daily dose of Madras-tamil in Boston. Of late I get to keep in touch with it when I chat with Abinesh.&nbsp; It is a refreshing feeling when you say wothhaa dei or $#%$#%$#%%^%^...hmmmmm.     What better reasons can I find to live in Madras. No matter what people say or how much they whine about it, Madras is definitely the best place to live in this whole wide world. I'll forever remain a proud son of chennai!!!

      I was talking to Abinesh and this incident that had taken place several years ago&nbsp;came to our minds. In fact I was in my 10th grade when this took place.&nbsp; I studied Tamil as my second language until my 10th grade. It is those Tamil classes in Montfort that have brought about my special bond with TamilNadu(i'm a mallu by the way). I associate myself to&nbsp;Chennaipattinam more than I do to mallu land.  &nbsp;  Tamil classes were always fun. Mr.Guruswamy aka Guru was a hilarious man. He would talk about the most outrageous topics in class much to our amusement.&nbsp; He would talk about anything from dirty women to dumb%$#%&nbsp; phoreners. I loved his class in every single way except for those times when i would not have completed my hand-writing homework.&nbsp;&nbsp;The look onmy face would seem like I had seen a ghost. And for some reason I always thought he&nbsp;didn't like&nbsp;me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed his classes..  &nbsp;  It was around the end of September when we were back in school after the Quarterly vacation. The first few days are anxious days because that is when you get back your test papers.&nbsp; I was enjoying&nbsp;my fun-filled Tamil class&nbsp; as usual until I heard an angry voice call out my name.&nbsp; I rushed to GURU's desk.&nbsp; He&nbsp; looked terribly disturbed and furious.&nbsp; I was this skinny little thing back in school. Back in my 10th grade I stood at 5'3&nbsp;&nbsp;and weighed around&nbsp;90 lbs. You can imagine.  &nbsp;  Anyway, I was already terrified by the look on GURU's face.&nbsp; A million thoughts ran in my mind. Did he get to know about that I have been making a fool of him and &nbsp;slacking with my hand-writing homework. Or did he hear all the&nbsp; !@^&amp;*#^*&nbsp; teenage comments that we had to pass on everything that even remotely looked feminine.&nbsp; Forgive us but then what else do you expect when you are in an ALL BOYS school.&nbsp;Our only source of JOY comes from Debonair, Fantasy, Filmfares,etc. &nbsp;Glory be to God!!! I can feel the pain of all the poor souls who are deprived of the of the god-given gift known as woman.&nbsp; May GOD show some mercy to these poor souls.  &nbsp;  Well, there I was standing in front of GURU.&nbsp; His very look would have burnt me alive. Yes, he was fuming with anger.&nbsp; There was this sudden silence in class. Out of nowhere he yelled, "NAAN UNNAKU ENNADA PANNINEN" (what did I ever do to you???)..... "NAAN&nbsp; SAAGURADHALA UNNAKKU ENNADA&nbsp; LAABAM" (what do you gain from me dying???"). All this made no&nbsp;sense to me. There I was standing with absolutely no clue as to what was going around me.&nbsp; To make matters worse, he got offended because I did not react to any of it. The truth my friends was that I had not the slightest of clues as to what was going on but he mistook it for arrogance. Then he showed me what In had written for one of my answers in the exam. All of a sudden, it all made sense to me.&nbsp; React I did, but then ended up cracking up.&nbsp; However, realizing that the situation demanded me to act like I was sorry, I did.&nbsp; So then i had to defend&nbsp; and I remember pleading "Sathiyama illa saar"(I swear I did not mean that)&nbsp; .. and the it went on..."Ennada Sathiyamma....evlo dhil unakku" (what guts do you have to write something like this....").  &nbsp;  This was what I had written on my answer sheet..."Raman, than guru irandhadhaal, ekkathudan pallikku sendran". &nbsp;To be honest I was even proud that I had written a good sentence in Tamil.&nbsp; What&nbsp;I meant was that "Since Raman's teacher(guru) had passed away, He went to school with a heavy heart" . People of the world, please tell me what wrong did I do here. But my GURU thought this guru in the sentence was him.&nbsp; Hmmm... needless to say, he threatened to take me to the principal&nbsp; and what not. I was not only the laughing stock of the class but also dreaded Tamil classes for the years to come. But he still remains one of my favourite teachers.

      The weekeend was quiet and peaceful. The only events worhty of mention would be the IDRF cricket tournament&nbsp;and the weekend clubbing. Barcelona.. hmm i can forsee a successful season ahead. My teams for the next would&nbsp;remain the same as always-Barcelona, Liverpool and InterMilan.&nbsp; There is also this new found hatred for Chelsea. The reason being my roomie. He has got the talent to make&nbsp; you hate the teams that you like. A rare but annoying talent.

      Most if not all of my blogs had a touch of sadness to them.&nbsp; It only refelcted my state of mind and was not meant to lash out at anybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;would not be&nbsp;posting any more of those in here anymore. One, I don't want the whole wide world to be reading them and second I want to add a comic touch to my posts. My inspiration Sindin Vadukut. This guy's posts are hilarious . The link to his blogs is  urlLink http://sidin.blogspot.com/ . It is a must read.

      A typical wednesday. Worked from 9 to 5 and then came back home and cooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am getting a little worried about IWS because I seem to be running out of time. Way too many things to look at at the same time. JAVA, Coldfusion, PHP, Perl, WML, Oracle, mySql and SQL Server, webmin, PMI. No, I am not listing all the possible web tools. These are all that I am working on at the moment and it is driving me nuts. My JAVA certification exams look a distant dream now. I am getting back to my usual self.&nbsp;I wonder if I exist to her. It feels like I have already become a part of her distant past. It may only have been a few days but she does give&nbsp; me that feeling.&nbsp; I&nbsp; begin wonder if people actually mean the things they say.

      Asha's B'day!!! One of the sweetest, goofiest & nicest people you would find. She is someone who would not even hurt a fly. I missed out on seeing her cut her cake but I made in time to eat it. I had made up my mind at the start of the day never to talk to Sairoo again. But things changed as the day rolled by. My anger subsided but not the pain. The last few days has left behind a scar that will remain for a long time to come. I did not see anything wrong in my decision. But I did change my mind because I did not want to lose a friend and also due to the influence of Sravi and Gaurav. I felt some inner peace within me. I felt strong within and I am tired of people hurting me. There are times when I begin to dip low but every time that happens Sandeep's words ring on my mind. I have not been working productively over the last few days because of lack of concentration. I promised myself that I would from today remain focused and work towards the goals I have set for myself. Asha then took us out to Bollywood Grill for dinner. The food was amazing. By far the best Indian restaurant I have dined at in this country. It was also nice to sip on some Indian beer. It has been more than two years since I have done that. I am more than gifted to have friends like Abinesh, Sandeep, Gaurav and Sravi. They have a made a big difference in my life and I cannot thank them enough.

      A quiet day it was but that was not until the dramatic end. My day at work was like any other day. I would be more than grateful if anybody could help me find any documentation on phpMyInventory. I gave my first shot at PHP. It looks easy for now. Cooked chicken for dinner. It did not come out the way I wanted it to but nevertheless turned out to be good. The day was to end on a bad note. The same old story where the bad guy loses. I can't stop laughing at myself. I never seem to learn. It is the story of my life. You give your heart to someone but someone else steals her away. I broke down the second she told me. Well, the general thought running around everybody's mind is that I must be used to it by now. It is more of disgust to be honest. You give all you have got and get nothing in return. I am paying for something I had done years ago. Yes, something I should not have done. I wish I could turn back time. Probably the only mistake I made but it was grave mistake. I called Sandeep. The only person who would truly understand what I was going through. His words were comforting and opened my eyes. Fought hard to find sleep. Eventually I did, all ready to start a new chapter in my life without a person who meant the world to me.

      A very significant day of my life. I must admit, I do feel like a terrible loser. The last of it had also come down crashing on me. How else would I rate all that has happened to me over the last two months. I fail a course I shouldn't have which eventually delayed my graduation. In less than a week I lose my job for no concrete reason. Then I begin to lose someone I love with all my heart. Yes, I poured it all out and gave it all I can for she deserved nothing less than the best in life. For once, I was genuinely happy with a girl. I truly was happy. I  have this tendency to change myself for the other person. But with her, it was just me, it was Pradeep all along. But that was short lived too. She wanted bring down the curtains. Until date I don't know the reason for it or atleast something that I can come close to believing. It was like a seesaw, moving up and down. And today, a day that I will remember for the rest of my life, I saw it all come crashing down. I gave her what she asked for. It made her very happy and so I stopped questioning my decision. But believe me when I say that this was by far the most difficult decision of my life. I told her that we should go our separate ways. Tears trickled down as I wrote those few lines to her. The pain within  me was unbearable. I wished I was dead. Yes, I really did wish I were dead. I am not writing this out of frustration. I am trying to very calm and composed at the moment. I prayed to Him all along asking him to give me the strength to do whatever I was doing because I had not the strength to do it on my own.  The only saving grace was that she seemed very happy. Well, that was the very reason I even came to this conclusion. I could see her slipping away from me; new friends, new reasons. I don't get to talk to her as much. But I still do care; still worried if she ate, did she reach home safe, did she sleep well, yes I still do care. And I am at this moment shedding tears as I write this posting. But I still stand by my statement, "Sairoo is the sweetest girl I've met all my life".

      Woke up early considering the fact that it was a saturday. I was not very happy that I wasn't there to wish Manoj when the clock struck 12. Yes, it was his birthday and I wasn't there. When you consider someone like your elder brother, you want to be there to wish him. I don't have siblings and my friends mean the world to me. Jagdish had come from New York to spend his Birthday with him. We had chinese for lunch. Later in the night we went to dinner and then Jillians. Dinner was at Kushboo in Lexington. They serve real good Indian food. The night at Jillians was alright. It is a terrific place but it was I who was spoiling the night for myself. My heart was heavy all along, really heavy. It felt like I a dark wave was sweeping over me. There is so much more to what I feel within me but I'm not going to pour it out here because I want to keep these postings as honest as I can. It does not prick my conscience to not write it all out here. They are dark feelings that would sink within me for the rest of my life.

      The weekend around the corner. Isn't it such a relief? Looking at it I just realize that in my case it is not the week's work that makes me long for the weekend. Work has for some reason never been an issue to me. In fact at most times I end up working on the weekends too. Definitely not as much as the weekdays but there is always something to do. Weekends I would say is the only time that we really get to go out with friends and let that extra steam out. Well, of late the reasons have been different. It is the only time I get to see an angel. It may sound exaggerated but it is the truth. She truly is an angel. Paid a visit to he hair dresser in the morning. Work was as always fine. Convinced Supriya that women after all are not as good as they potray themselves. If you had read my previous posting you could tell how disgusted I am about the whole thing. I am sure there are women out there who share the feeling towards men as I do towards women. I might have agreed with them three years ago but the last few years have ben very painful. Not just for me but for many of my friends too. The night was good. Went to Whiskey Park. It was my first time there and it was not a bad place at all. Gaurav & I had picked up Shilpy on our way and Saira came along with D & Trishna. Finding Shilpy seemed such a daunting task. However we did manage to find her place after a good thirty minutes. Sairoo looked beautiful tonight. Her smile lit up the dance floor and her sweetness transformed everybody's evening into an amazing  one. I was irritated for some reason and in the process managed to irritate Sairoo too. I did apologize and we were alright. All in all a good day. There have been these strange feelings beginning to take over me over the last few days. I feel lonely. It seems like I am in the middle of a barren dessert with nobody to turn to for help. The kind of feeling you get when you realize that you are beginning to lose someone very precious in life and there is nobody to help you. Not even God almighty!!

      A long long day it was. Went in for a meeting to Predator Watch in the morning. It went pretty good. I was given an overview of the product and was also assigned my module. The work looks very interesting. Came in staright to CyberEd and worked until 8. Spoke to Abinesh for a long time. Boy, what is happening to this world?? Abi and Laks have gone through some rough times. The kind of things you can only imagine. Looking at them I feel it is a criminal act if i ever complained that my life sucked. I still do stick to it though,  my life does suck.I once even had this on my profile - "It sucks to be me". Well coming back to it, it broke my heart when i heard about things that had happened over the course of the last year or so. Why is life so cruel?? Why?? And for all the men out there, yes we are a bunch of jerks. But then tell you what, we are any day better than than what the women think they are. I don't wish to spill out all my feelings at this point. But then for starters all of you should know this. Behind every probelm that exists, there is a woman. There is this saying in tamil that goes liek this "All that comes into existence is because of a woman and all that is destroyed is also because of a woman". How fitting huh? This is not an angry outlash at the female species but facts as they exist. I have not lost respect for women, atleast not yet. I joked with Abinesh about something that he had told me seven years ago. This is what he told me "NEE AZHINJAA ADHU PENAALADHAN". It was only in jest that he had told this, but then I see it happening to me right in front of my eyes. I see myself withering away, little by little. I just sit here wondering is there any such thing as love at all?? They say love is something that you get more of by giving it away. But in my case the more I give the more it destroys me. Have good men lost their place in this world?

      Nothing auspicious about today. One of those ordinary days. Work was not bad. Got a lot of studying done. Had a bit of a tiffle with moomoo which was the only downside of the day. I did not approve of something she did and I am certain that she cannot deny it either. Things between us may not be as rosy as they were earlier but that is not going to let me sit back and see her hurt herself all over again. She deserves the best in life. I only pray that she does not put herself throught those painful experiences once again. And, if I did react it was because I care for her and nothing else. The rest of it was the usual routine of work out and cooking. Sandeep confirmed that he would be visiting me at the end of this month. That definitely sounds like a lot of fun. So, that was my day for you.

      On a whole, it was a good day. A day well begun is half done. What better way than to spend hours talking to someone who means a lot to you. That meant less sleep but it is all good. My day at work flew past me. Spent a little time studying JAVA, though I felt I did not do justice to the time available in hand. Raghu called on my way home from work. It felt so good talking to him as I had not spoken to him in over two months. He is his usual self, the crazy old raghu we all know. But then he seems to be focussed with work which is a very good sign. Saira called and poor girl had a bad head ache. There is so much to write about her and it could run to pages. I will make it a point to do that in the days to follow. I tried my hand at racquet ball as I was not in a state to work out. My finger hurt and felt tired for some reason that i was not able to figure out.  I then played some golf at home, had dinner, spoke to Sandeep then Madhuri and it was time to wind up to go to bed as another day had come to a close.

      We live each day of our lives with a vision of the future. A future that promises the best that life has to offer. But it is when  this vision is lost that an individual begins to lose grip of his or her life. All of us go in search of happiness and joy. According to Darwin "Survival of the Fittest" defines evolution. Well, I'm a firm believer that this theory is also well suited for our everyday lives. Hence there exists within us a driving force that guides us through each day. What is it in my case? A tricky question it is but I shall be as honest as I can be. I am an ambitious person. I am a dreamer with a lot of passion for whatever I do. Living in luxury in my dream castle with my princess, a porsche to ride in and experience all the worldly pleasures are not merely dreams. I have faith in me that I would realize these dreams. But then pause right there. To me life means more than the above materialistic pleasures. Undying love and happiness are of great importance to me. I am happy as long as I reach my goals. It does not cause me any anxiety to see someone do better than me. Take my word for it, I couldn't be happier for you. There have been many obstacles where I have stumbled but each one them has made me stronger for tommorow. Twenty years down the lane I want to be able to look back and say "Yes,I did make something out of my life". The above constitute the light that burns within me that guides me through each day of my life.

      A rather short insignificant day. One of those days that make you wonder if you could have made better use of it. My day started late. Reluctantly woke up at 2P.M. Made myself brunch and even before I realized, I found myself cooking dinner. There were plans to go to the movies with Parshu and Reshma which did not materialize. There were these  usual stints of mental suffocation. I get this numb feeling, a lonely feeling that seems to shut out all the light in the universe. A feeling that I would not want even my worst enemy to go through. Reasons are plenty. Few of them nobody can do anything about, a few in my control and the rest in the hands of an angel. Well, to clear the air with regard to my earlier statement, I have made no enemies all my life. So, it was my third straight day at home. Restless as I was, did the best I could to find myself excuses to leave the house. But that wasn't to be until I received a call from Parshu and Reshma. They had missed the last train to Boston. Next thing i know, we were driving to Boston. It was a quiet ride. We managed to lose our way a couple of times in Cambridge but recovered nevertheless. And now, here I am sitting by myself wondering what the day ahead has in store for me. Strange are the ways of life. Don't you think so?

      Let me take the oppurtunity to introduce myself. I go by the name of Pradeep Seshan. But,I have been baptized more times than I can remember. Pups,kosu,bonda,goat and stan are a few to list. The early days of my childhood were in Madras. I then spent a good ten years of my life in Yercaud. I call it the place of dreams. After which I moved back to Madras to pursue my Bachelors in Engineering. Spent four memorable years there before moving to Boston for my graduate studies. I would hence divide my life thus far into four. My roots trace back to small villages in Kerala. My father grew up in Kalpathi, a small town in Pallakad. My mother was born in Madras as my grandparents had moved to there from Mookuthala in Kerala. I have visited Mookuthala a few times but never been to Kalpathi. My life would be incomplete if I failed to. My father's side of the family has produced legends in carnatic music. Pallakad Mani Iyer, Pattamal and Nithyashree are a few to name.   I am the only child to my parents. Don't mistake that for me being a spoilt brat. My family and friends mean the world to me. I can get very defensive if they are harmed in anyway. I am passionate about what I do. There is a romantic side to me and I dream a lot. I love nature and until date regret for not pursuing my dream of becoming a bio-technologist. Well, that does not in any way mean that I don't like the career I have chosen. Sports has been a big part of my life. Played soccer and table tennis during my younger days and I still do find time to play them time to time. I was not the best in either of them but was good in my own right. I am a die hard fan of Barcelona FC. Watching them play at the Nou Camp would realize one of my long lasting dreams. My choice in music covers a wide range. I will close this post for now. More of me would come in the days to follow.

      It is 5:17 am, the morning of 5th of July. It is a monday. Is it an auspicious day?? No, it isn't. What is it?? It is merely an outpour. Sleepless nights seemed to have given way to this. I'm calling my scripts "My Fairy Tales". Are they fairy tales?? I don't have the answer to this question. To me fairy tales are a bunch of lies wrapped in a beautiful story. Don't get me wrong when I say so. I do like fairy tales. My statement, merely my opinion. So is my fairy tale a lie?? No it isn't. It is a fairy tale with a difference. You have got to come to terms with the fact that my fairy tale is not a sugar coated candy. Forgive me for my attempt to sound poetic at times. Afterall, I love to write just as much as I love to talk. It has been missing over the last six years. This is just an attempt to ignite those old flames.

         During my daily dose of Domain Maximus aka Sidin's blogs, I happened to read "Travails of a South Indian" (god alone knows how many times I've read it). There were these comments by people who were offended by the phrase "us and them"(us= south indians & them=north indians...sidin is a southie). So I decided to pen  my thoughts on the thin line that divides us andthem.     I've always been a proud Indian and no matter what happens this isn't EVER gonna change. To me India is India and there was no division between the north and the south. Well, I saw a whole new world from the day I set my foot into the USA and until date I've been perplexed. What is wrong with us Indians???     My first few days in Lowell were for some reason spent exclusively with southies(not that minded it). It was in a way a blessing in disguise coz every other northie that I bumped into would patriotically whip out a few lines in hindi and all I would do was stare back at them with a blank face. I would have to put all my poor brain cells to work extra hard when they exceeded more than a line in hindi(the first line is usually a "kaise hai yaar" or a "kaise chalraha hai"). I could deal with that. I ran into serious problems when I was expected to understand more Hindi than that(I've improved now...can actually talk a few sentences...also taking lessons in punjabi and gujju...comon the gals r cute). All my replies to their enquirieswould be in English & I would get a frown in return. Well, many of them mistook my replies in "angrayzi" for arrogance. The truth was that poor me didn't understand a d*** of what was coming out of their mouth. You could talk to me for five whole minutes and all you would get in return was a blank look &amp; an occasional nod of acknowledgement(not that i really understood a thing).     After those inital days I got to meet lots of northies. Soon, something became evident. I was the only indian kid who did not know hindi and that was no fun. All the other southies could atleast hold up a conversation in hindi...not me. I soon became the laughing stock. On Independence day two years ago, we were playing dumb charades and the movie was "Nache Mayuri". I put my brain to some extra work wondering what it meant. My only question was if "Nache was sing or dance". After a little self fought battle I ended up tossing a coin within & concluded it was "SING mayuri". I probably should have kept my mouth shut but ended up blurting it out to the guy next to me...it is sing mayuri rite?? What do you expect after that?? I would have done myself a big favour by rather digging a grave for myself. The differences in the languages was definitely not helping. In tamil or mallu, "chumma" means simply (or) for the heck of it. That is not the case in hindi. It is a regular usage in the south. For 22 years of my life I did not have issues using that word but it was beginning to drive away all my chances of hitting it off with the female species out here. It also became a major concern for the guys. The northie guys freaked out when I used the word. I don't blame them coz if I was a northie and was say playing tennis &amp; some dude came up to me & told me " Do you wanna chumma play" (all he means is do u wanna casually play..no harm meant..lol) I would've vanished from the face of the planet to end up hiding under my bed in mars praying to the almighty to keep him as far away from me as possible(YESSS, I know it is legal in mass &amp; I've had a zillion gal probs but then I'm STILL straight people).     The initial days were definitely fun-filled but things began to change. I noticed this clear distinction between northies and southies. What was even worse was that gujjus wud stick with gujjus & golts with golts. Not blaming them. I'm sure it wud've been the same with mallus or punjus or whoever(easy to pick on the two coz they form the majority). It didn't make too much sense to me at first coz I do have northie friends back in madras and all of us gelled in really well. The problem here was that each one would sit &amp; *itch about the other. And I noticed that it was more the case with the northies than with the southies (damnn.. I hate myself for having to use the terms southies and northies). I am not making this claim coz I'm from the south. It is a fact. In fact over the last year or so I ended up making 5 north indian friends for every south indian (lots of gals included..so no complains..lol). If I am to count, I will end up with more northie friends.     Various incidents over the last two years have pushed me to the point where I get very defensive when it comes to people ridiculing the southies. It is fun to a certain extent but when things are blown out of proportion it begins to prick you a little too hard to sit quiet.    The first complain every northie has is that you don't know hindi. Yes, I agree it is the national language  and also it is wonderful to know a whole new language. But then, for heaven's sake it is not the end of the world. I at times get dirty looks from people, like as thought I had commited the cardinal sin. Comon, I'm almost 24 now and have lived with it all my life without losing a single hair coz of that. Do I ask you to speak tamil or mallu?? Hell no!!! If you speak it good otherwise its still good...lol. I don't look at you like you are this big sinner. And for all the northie-hindi faithful, there are places in the north where they don't talk hindi. Interior Maharashtra for example, not all speak hindi..rite????? That is just one example. I'm a mallu but born & brought up in Madras and hence speak mallu and tamil. Say I was born in Africa, I would've probably spoken swahili or zulu or yauma or God alone knows what...so just give me a break.      The next big hit are the movies. I do agree that Rajni has proven all laws of sciences wrong. But then, comon if James Bond from Hollywood and Mithun from Bollywood can do it, why not our good old "Superstar" Rajni?? Never am I going to rest in peace if people claim that South Indian films are under-par. You would probably lose count of the number of tamil films that have been dubbed or remade into hindi. The reverse...hmmm yet to begin me guessing. Almost every other year you have a mallu film(which i wouldn't recommend watchin' for pure entertainment sake..lol)winning a national award. Yeah that reminds me of a claim that Sandeep's roomie once made. According to him all films from the south are porn. And for all you know the dude has never watched a single film from the south. Yes, mallu land does boast of having the largest porn industry in the country and BIG pornstars like shakeela (u guys heart her.. don't you??). All those who have secretly watched Surya TV on sunday nights raise your hands!!! Well, if you have not burst out laughing in a long time, wait until you hear this. There was once this hot debate, the topic.. damnnnn "who is better Bappi Lahiri & Anu Malik or Rehman". Enough said.. I'm closing this movie thing for now.     I could go on & on, on this topic but its only going to send me sooner to my grave( I can already see all my friends ganging up on me).Why such divisions?? We claim to be a secular country and boast of "Unity in Diversity". So, let us live upto that and keep our flag flying high.NO southie..NO Northie.. jus INDIANS. Doesn't that sound better??   PS: I hated the usage of the terms northie &amp; southie. It was easier than using North Indian or South Indian. Also it was solely for the purpose of the blog So, please don't send me hate-mails...lol. But please do comment.. Also, I might have been biased towards the south. So all my friends from the north, if you do have anythin' to say please go ahead..its gonna be funn but then heyy.. no war though huh :)..its all in good humour.
