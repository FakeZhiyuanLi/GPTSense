       Harold & Kumar Go To Whitecastle  made me very very happy. Before I go on, allow me to make a few concessions: first, I concede that it was not perfect. Second, I concede that parts of it were not that funny. Third, I concede that it will not win best picture. Like, ever.  That being said, it was better than I had anticipated.  The movie's title sums up the main thrust of the action. To clarify further, it is about two stoned roommates who have a mutual jones for Whitecastle hamburgers. The movie is about their journey to the nearest Whitecastle where they do, in fact, consume these burgers. But there is so much more!  Directed by the same person who directed  Dude, Where's My Car  (his name escapes me at the moment... I think it begins with an L)  Harold & Kumar  contains a similar surreal feel. Our heroes meet a strange backwoods repairman, a group of "extreme!" sports fanatics and an escaped cheetah among others. (Others include Neil Patrick Harris as himself.) They experience numerous trials and ordeals and they learn a lesson in the end.  For those of you pondering my fascination with this movie (I'm a California girl who, until yesterday, didn't know what Whitecastle was and I tend more towards liquid intoxication than  its inhaled counterparts) I can say that a lot of it has to do with the characters. Harold and Kumar are simply a joy to watch. Despite the zaniness of their adventures, the real meat of the movie is simply watching them interact. And I could do that all day.  I promised more negativity and so here it is: in addition to being well done as a character-driven weird narrative, the movie is also crude, gross, and, at times, tasteless. But the fact that Harold and Kumar are portrayed as such true, realistic, fully realized characters trumps all that. I also appreciated that both of them were smart. Pot isn't their lives -- it is how they unwind. And this movie is a perfect vehicle for unwinding after a long, hard, um, weekend. I would recommend it, but only if you also appreciated the genius of  Dude, Where's My Car?  If not (and especially if you are one of my parents) you will not like this film at all.

      You know, it's rather hard to watch crime shows with guest stars. It takes away a large portion of the surprise.  Take, for instance, tonight's episode of  urlLink  The Dead Zone  . I knew from last week's preview that it was going to be about a school shooting. And, being a  Sopranos  fan, I also knew that it would guest-star Robert Iler (AKA Anthony Junior, A.J., Tony's son, whatever). Coming into the show, I was left with two options: 1) A.J. would turn out to be the shooter. 2) A.J. would look like the shooter up until the end when it would be revealed that he was, in fact, just tragically misunderstood. (Please don't remind me that A.J. and Robert Iler are different people. I know. I just choose to ignore.)  So, tonight's episode:  Anthony Michael Hall goes to his son's play and has a vision informing him that there will soon be a school shooting. He and a blonde woman I have never seen before (hey, I'm a recreational watcher) spend the first half of the ep rounding up all the potential kids who might want to raise hell. This turns out to be largely inconclusive. Soon thereafter, someone calls in a bomb threat.  I have some fundamental issues with this episode. For one, the school authorities are pretty generic Hollywood teachers: they're authoritarian, they cling to the rules in the face of adversity, and they have no appreciable sense of humor. One might think they had never been young. One might write them off as simply sadists who had gone into education for the sole purpose of tormenting others. One, no, strike that,  I  get the impression that the people who write most television shows had bad experiences in high school. For this I am sorry. But portraying all teachers and administrators as the rule-worshipping enemy is not the solution to anyone's problem. Are there status-quo adhering teachers and administrators? Certainly. Do people join the profession just so they can bully others? Jury's out. That's not why I'm doing it. We're all going to continue to be people and teenagers are going to continue to try to find themselves in high school and beyond. I would like to see what most Hollywood writers would do if they were put in charge of a high school. How would that be portrayed? Would they still need to slash their peers with the stigma of counter-cool?  But I digress.  A.J. later turns out to be relatively violent, and this is bad. Even Anthony Michael Hall thinks it's bad, and he paints his customary pained and haunted look back onto his face. Does anyone else miss   urlLink The Breakfast Club ?  AMH doesn't, however, think that A.J. is "the shooter," and now we enter into the superbly twisty third act. I won't go into what happens next, but I honestly thought it could have been a little bit more interesting than it was. If you have my number and you want to ask me what I think should have happened, give me a call. Or, alternatively, post your thoughts below and we can all argue about it.  Let me get a few things straight. I like   urlLink The Dead Zone .  I don't watch it on any regular basis, but I have nothing really against it. And I like Anthony Michael Hall, although the conceit of visions that preclude him from ever having to look at inconsequential things like "evidence" does seem a little too easy. But this episode borders on the ridiculous. Until the last few minutes, it's practically worthy of  urlLink  Boston Public  , and AMH and Stephen King are above that. So is Robert Iler, actually.  And honestly, if you could touch things and see the future, do you really think you would want to solve crimes? I, for one, thought that AMH's unique visions were better utilized last week when he spent a good portion of the episode scoping out girls his friend thought were cute at a wedding. But I also enjoy  urlLink  Elimidate  , so take my advice with all necessary grains of salt.

      You might be sitting beside your computer engaged in an intelligent conversation with it.  "Computer," you might be saying right now, in the tone of voice you might use to imply that you actually take the time to read my weblog, even though you don't comment, "if that girl wants to be an amateur film critic, why hasn't she reviewed any movies recently? And why nothing new?"  It might take a few seconds for the computer to formulate his response. He might have to zip along through several versions of an answer urlLink  Google-style  before coming across the best one possible. He might take a sip of his Cabernet and gaze thoughtfully into the middle distance for a few seconds before responding. Heed not his attempts to seem more intelligent. If he begins to sigh, simply threaten to douse his oh-so-precious keys with wine.  I anticipate that he will immediately perk right up, and that he will then provide you with this answer:  She hasn't done anything recently because she's been busy. All work and no play may make Jack a dull boy, but all play and no work makes Liz a broke girl. In other news, she wants to see a movie but all her friends are out of town and she still retains enough misplaced dignity not to want to go alone. Nothing playing down the street from her house looks good. And, most shamefully of all...  She has been watching television.   urlLink      urlLink Freaks and Geeks ,  to be more specific.  Should the computer respond in this manner, he is not to be punished. He has told the truth.  I love  Freaks and Geeks.  A friend recently gave me the new DVD set for my birthday, and I am totally addicted. I love that the show portrays the sorts of people I didn't have the luck to meet until college with such warmth, candor and respect for the human spirit. I love that the creators cared so much about their show that they refused to release it on DVD without all of the music in place. I love that the actors look like kids who might feasibly be in high school. And I love that nothing is sugar-coated.  When Lindsay (Linda Cardellini) begins to date a boy in her new social circle, she has misgivings. She doesn't fall madly in love with him, and their romance is presented in all honesty like a high school romance. She breaks up with him but she still retains warm feelings that she knows she can't act on. None of this is presented in the form of a melodrama; rather, it happens on the periphery of other events.  When I finished watching the series on DVD last night, I experienced such a profound rush of elation at having watched fictional characters live lives approximating mine that I had to go to bed because I didn't know how to deal. I was overcome with the bittersweetness of a show that can be THAT good and still get cancelled.  And I swore a solemn oath that the next movie I take the time to review will be bad. I'm sick of all the positiveness of this weblog. It's time you all saw that I don't love everything I see.  Now...what shall I see?

       urlLink http://www.nea.gov/news/news04/ReadingAtRisk.html   There are quite a few articles circulating about this topic, but this one is pretty good. And it's a very important topic. Engage your imagination, please?  And if you need any suggestions, might I recommend the following to get started:  urlLink   Rumors of Peace  by Ella Leffland  I just bought this one from Amazon for thirty-nine cents. With shipping, that's still under three bucks. I read it in seventh grade and just restarted it this evening. It's amazing how timely it is, actually. It's about a girl growing up during World War Two in a little town thirty miles from San Francisco, and it starts with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.   urlLink  Middlesex  by Jeffrey Eugenides  A coming-of-age story about a person with ambiguous genitalia. He was raised as a girl and the book covers not only his emergence as a young man but also many of the defining events of the last century or so. Hard to describe, harder to stop reading.  urlLink   Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight  by Alexandra Fuller  I'm not going to try to describe this. It's beautiful. It's amazing. It's scary and moving at the same time and it makes full use of each word. It's one of my absolute favorite books of all time. If you haven't read it, you are missing out.  In addition, even if you're busy, Amazon is a great resource. You can find, order and pay for your books all in one convenient location. (Anyone reading this probably knew that, but I just made three links to them so now I feel like I should plug them by name). And then when the books arrive it's like Christmas! Or your birthday! Or some really good, happy day. And you can sit back, get a nice glass of wine and enter into some other life for a little while. Please keep reading.   urlLink www.amazon.com

      Let me comment just briefly on  Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.   I expected to hate this movie. I generally despise slapstick. I can feign amusement at it for about three minutes before I start thinking about something else. In fact, I only saw  Dodgeball  for two reasons: 1) I enjoy Ben Stiller. And 2) I abhor the game dodgeball and was curious to see what kind of movie could possibly be made about it. (And, tangentially, who  doesn't  hate dodgeball? It's an awful game. It's violent. It's pointless. It's like someone wanted to make up a game but couldn't come up with anything more interesting so they started taking out their friends with hard plastic balls in frustration. I spent most of my dodgeball experiences making sure I was tagged early so I could stand at the sidelines and make fun of the people who were actually trying. But I digress.)  The movie  Dodgeball  starts off with a kind of giddy energy that propels it raucously forward until the last twenty minutes or so. It's funny. Ben Stiller is ridiculously (and scarily) amusing as a bodybuilder who wants to take over a decrepit neighborhood gym to build a parking lot and Vince Vaughan is the low-key owner of the decrepit gym. The two decide to resolve their differences in a dodgeball tournament where it would be possible for the less athletic friends of Vaughan to win enough money to save their gym. Strangely, the energy of the movie only flags when the characters actually arrive at the tournament. There is one moment of sudden, awful cruelty that does not fit with the overall tone of the film -- and, for me, it was hard to get back into the swing of the movie for the celebratory finale.  Despite this bad taste at the end, the movie was generally good. It will not win any awards, and it shouldn't. But it was definitely worth the money it cost to see it and I may see it again when it comes out on DVD. I'll skip the part near the end so it doesn't kill my mood for the climax.

      So, according to what I have been reading,  M. Night Shyamalan's  The Village  is one of the worst movies ever made. The dialogue is bad, the "twist" isn't twisty enough, the characters are boring and the colors are dull. This interests me because I left the theater happily heralding Shyamalan's return to making films I enjoy. Let me explain.   Signs , for instance, was not a film I enjoyed. I felt like it was all buildup and no payoff -- the movie equivalent of a particularly wasted evening out. By contrast,  The Village  takes its buildup somewhere new: to allegory.   The Village  is the story of a small community surrounded by forest in the 1800s. The denizens of the village live there under an uneasy truce with "those we do not speak of," strange creatures whose howling and movement in the woods can be heard in the village at all hours of the day and night. It is emphasized time and again early in the film that the borders of the village have not been breached in many years, and that, by extension, it would not be prudent for the villagers to enter into the woods, thus provoking attack. The movie opens with the funeral for a young child who has evidently died due to lack of proper medicinal supplies. Although one young man, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) desires to venture into the woods to procure "medicines" from the "towns" beyond the forest, the elders of the village advise against his proposal, citing the fragility of their relationship with "those we do not speak of." His eventual response to their refusal sets into motion the events that make up much of the rest of the movie.  Filmed under almost universally gray skies, the movie evokes a texture of tension and worry. Everyone in the Village, it seems, lives in perpetual fear, not simply of "those we do not speak of" but also of the color red, referred to only as "the bad color." Early on, there is a montage of rural life which includes two girls spinning happily on a porch as they sweep. Their smiles are quickly wiped clean, however, when one of them spots a small, brilliantly red flower growing at the end of the porch. They hasten to uproot and bury the flower and go about their sweeping with drawn faces. It is not explained immediately why this color is "bad" and the connotations of the violence associated with red are later explored more fully.  Perhaps the attitude of solemnity that pervades the film is partially to blame for its panning. Characters speak in long, quasi-formal sentences and phrases. They use long-winded phrases to describe things: "those we do not speak of," for instance, and "the shed which must never be opened." Many critics have written off the dialogue in this movie as laughable, and, indeed, much of it is. But it also contributes to the sense of place. The dialogue gives the film an otherworldly feel that fits nicely with the impression that each character seems to be straining against something. The stilted nature of the dialogue makes clear verbally the conflicting desires and thoughts buried inside the puritanical clothing and demeanor of the characters. Without this strange, formal air, everything might seem to be all right. And in fact, nothing is.  Regardless of my own fascination with it, I doubt that everyone who sees this film will enjoy it. It reveals itself slowly, and thrives more on a sense of impending horror than on numerous thrills. Allegorically, it seems to reflect our times, but its reflections are quiet when compared to most "thriller" movies. It simmers rather than heating madly to a boil and leaves one with a sense of profound unease. If this interests you, I would advise you to see it. You might even like it.
