      Why are people stubborn? Why do we all hold our frustrations inside and not share this with those who we are angry with? I can say that virtually every time I have been holding in anger - the person that I am angry with either has no idea they are the target of my frustrations or they have a completely different, yet valid, perspective of the entire situation. Please, our lives on earth is too short to hold in negativity that is hurting ourselves and others. The energy used for being angry is much more efficient when focused on something positive.

      I just had a few things I wanted to get out this morning.   I read the book "The Notebook" by Nicholas Sparks over the weekend. What a wonderful book. True love is an amazing thing. If you think you know what true love is...you don't. If you know in your heart that you know what true love is...you're a member of a chosen few. As I read this book, I reflected on the relationship I have with my husband. The love we share is so true and so deep that nothing could ever get in its way, much like the love shared in "The Notebook." Not even an evil disease like Alzheimer’s disease could come between Noah and Allie. It's a beautiful story about how truelove is always being reborn. It made me want to hold my true love a little closer. I love you Matty! I have also just learned about a sequel to “The Notebook” called “The Wedding.” I will surely be making time to read this book soon. It looks like it is a story about a child of Noah and Allie. Nicholas Sparks has pulled me in and now I am hooked!   I also watched "Bicentennial Man" last night. For those of you that aren't familiar with the movie, Andrew Martin (Robin Williams) is a household android whose intended function is thrown for a loop when he begins to feel genuine human emotions. Over the next two centuries the resulting dealings with his adopted family and new acquaintances provide the film with ample opportunities to raise important questions about individual human existence, as Andrew seeks to become human. It is a wonderful movie that makes me question what makes a spirit a spirit. I have always believed that a spirit is an energy that can never be killed, just transformed and lives on indefinitely. This character begins as a robot and is completely animatronic. Over time he begins to form a personality and feelings. With the growing technological innovations, he is able to replace his robotic inners to prosthetic organs and lives like a human. But does this make him into a spirit that is seen by God? I don’t know. He is an individual because there is no one else like him. He wasn’t created by the typical miracle of birth…however, it is a miracle the way he is able to develop and grow into this completely unique entity. Anyway, it made me think a little deeper.

      I have been inspired. I now have a blog. I am thinking that this will be a good way for me to vent frustrations and expresses my excitement. I figure that no one except myself will care to ever look at it - but - what the heck - here I am!

      Well, Tuesday morning I left work and headed to my home that I expected to live in for another 2 years or so. By the time a walked through my door, I knew I wanted to move to a different house. Tuesday evening, we listed our house. By Wednesday morning, my husband and I purchased the house we never thought we would have. Can you imagine...with a span of&nbsp;15 hours, my whole life has been put in a blender. The pressure is on to get our house sold in a matter of weeks. Some family is super supportive, others are a bit indifferent. Matt and I are excited. But, I must admit, I am more nervous than I can remember ever being. There is so much pressure to sell, get approved for financing, and make the new (bigger) house payment. This is what I have always wanted...a home to have a family grow and share with those I love. But, I can't stop thinking... what if . What if we don't sell our house, what if we can't get approved for financing, and what if we can't make the new monthly payments. I dream about getting turned down for a loan and I wake not knowing if it was reality. Other times, I wake counting the amount of debt my husband and I have and trying to calculate debt-ratios in twilight sleep. I toss and turn and wonder if anyone else is awake at this ungodly hour. I have thought about succombing to nerve medication - but I don't want to depend on that. I want to live this experience to the fullest - being able to look back on it and remembering it as one of the best times of my life. I don't want to be numb. I don't want that for myself - but the nervousness hurts sometimes. I wish someone understood...

      There are terms that we always use that I have never understood. Like "How come?" - what does that really mean? I can't even break that down to try to understand where that came from. Please, just say "Why?" &nbsp; But today I have found the term that I hate the most - "Make Time." Time is a limited resource that no matter how hard we work or how much we save or how long we wait&nbsp;- we can never make more of it. Each day will only&nbsp;have 24 hours and each week will only be 7 days long. No matter how hard we try, time cannot be made. There are no ingredients to put together&nbsp;and you can't wait for it to grow - there is only so much of it&nbsp;and that is the way it always has been and it will always be. Another similar term, "Find time." Well, where did you leave it? Time is not concrete. It's not something you left in yesterday's pants.  &nbsp; Time can't be lost or found or loved or hated or made or broken. It is a theory, a nonspatial continuum, an idea. We can't make time, we can't find time and we can't lose time. All we can do is make the best use of our time that we can. Who's to say what the best use of our time is but ourselves. What do you value enough to spend your time doing?
