         I just got a call from a friend, who was at a concert with Múm. He just told me to hang up when I didn't want to hear anymore and put the phone in his pocket. So without being there I'm sure it was a good concert.  By the way the above picture is Black Russian under a microscope.

         and better weather, I don't really like when it rains.   The plane I fly was broken again today. Towing it to the mechanic is getting a bad habit. Instead I got a trip in another plane flying a guy to a little grass strip I've never heard of. It was a short 15 minute flight to a very narrow runway 700 meters long, whereof only about 500 meters were usable due to high trees at the end. On top of that it was really bumpy and the grass hadn't been cut for a while. All in all it was a great ride, when you normally fly to long paved runways at controlled airports, it's nice trying this sort of stuff.

        I've just found this picture on the net. It's me taxiing out to the runway in Stauning. Well you can't actually see me, but it's me sitting behind my instructor.  I'm listening to The new Pornographers right now, not sure if I like them as much as I used to. What happened?

      A day for laying in front of the TV doing nothing. I was at a friends 25 year birthday yesterday and it became pretty late. It was nice to see some of the guys from the old flightschool. I stayed the night at a nice hostel  urlLink www.citysleep-in.dk  it's nice with a real bed. It was a nice sunny day today, that always help on the hangover (and good fast-food). At home I sat in the garden for a while, but decided for the TV instead. Well it's not all roses, I have to do some flightplanning tonight. Tomorrow I'm flying my single-engine final check, I'll have to do well on that! More on that later.

      Everybody is starting their holiday now, but me! But I can't complain because I don't work and don't go to school. If I just had money life would be great.  €€€€ always the problem :)  One of my friends just bought a turntable, it's catching on. By the way if you want the best LPs insound.com they are just so great, and they don't even pay me to say this.

      Music makes me feel good.  When I'm sad it will make me feel glad,  when I'm happy it will make me dance.  quiet punk, speedy pop, pumping rock.   But please stop playing that rap crap!!!

      "It was the struggle of the century"  I've got my internet back again today. It has been ´broken´ for about 14 days now, seems like forever.   Much has happened since last post, but mostly all small things. I've quit my ´day job´, that's a pretty big thing to do though. It sucked and I couldn't stand it anymore. Strangely enough I have more money than I have had for years. Probable because I know that I have to spend it wisely now.   If things go wrong and I spend my money on something stupid I could allays go to the bank and ask for a loan to buy a violin box, I'll be seeing you later!  Happy dreaming :)
