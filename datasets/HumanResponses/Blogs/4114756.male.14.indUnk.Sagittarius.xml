       REVIEW 21 is a periodic self assessment I will do at the 21st of every month. It will be my short-term aim setting.    Review 21 Aim Statement  : To get A1 for all subjects with the exclusion of chinese, to cut some slack and to get an L1R5 of 6 by the end of this year.   Review 21 Mission statement  : Believe in yourself  Review21 is in line with Mission24 long term statement, in which I'll get a major life thing done ( which requires lots of cash ) at age 24. My plan to 24 is one of success, work and optimism. Going into a good JC, taking a good university module, getting a master's degree, then getting a great job. And when I have accumulated $10000-20000 from my job ( by age 24 ), I'll get something done. Also in line with my Mission30, which is to accumulate life savings of at least S$1 million by then.

      Trust is a key building block of every friendship. Without it, friendship is not friendship - it is acquaintance. Trust is the material which builds up the strong and rigid framework of the friendship. Without a framework, then the ship will not sail and the sails will disintegrate.  My question goes : Will you trust your best friend?  Please respond by clicking the 'x comments' below this post. Thanks. I'ld really like to know what you all feel about trust and your best friend.

      i think its time to carry on, stop dwelling on the past, look to the future. don't be pessimistic. stop this depression thing and just look on to the bright future. learn to believe. believe in yourself. blieve that if you have the will to do sth, you will eventualli do it. learn to believe. learn to blieve that nothing bad's going to happen. verythings ok. don't be ultra-paranoid. don't be whatever. look at the light at the end of the dark tunnel. the sky might be falling on u. but ur internal energy will hold it up. lol  b4 i forget.. here's a nice story. read it before a few years back, but still find it very meaningful. i hope that the hurt i might have caused to some ppl over the years will eventually be covered by the sand, leaving what good i've done engraved in stone..  A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.  The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand:  TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.  They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone:  TODAY MY BEST FRIEND SAVED MY LIFE.  The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, "After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?" The other friend replied "When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it."  LEARN TO WRITE YOUR HURTS IN THE SAND AND TO CARVE YOUR BENEFITS IN STONE.  They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them, but then an entire life to forget them.  might as well add sth : TODAY MY BEST FRIEND TRUSTED ME

         Copulins are pheromones which are composed of aromatic compounds found in vaginal secretions.     Research has shown that:      When men inhale copulins it can increase their testosterone levels by about 150%, almost instantaneously.     In the presence of copulins, men judge women to be more attractive.         This means that copulins can be useful for women to use to attract men, and for men to use on themselves to temporarily increase their testosterone levels.           Today I have just witnessed the terrible and evil effects of copulin. One in which the conscious mind is over-rided. This happened not to me, but to someone else. IT IS AMAZING HOW PHEROMONES CAN DEGRADE SOMEONE FROM A SENTINENT HUMAN TO A SEXUAL SUB-HUMAN BEING 'CONTROLLED' ! From an outsider's Point of view, its very very potent - copulins. they are evil. So from now on, I shall protect myself from the evils of Copulin and other pheromones. This is done by VENTILATING the classroom. Also, I shall find ways to destroy pheromones in the air. Pheremones and copulins are evil. I shall seek u out n destroy u. liquidate u. vaporise u. disintegrate u. go n die

OH! THE CONCERT WON'T START! I was like "wtf, go teaR IT LAH who want 2 see ".  ohyeah. its pretty crowded at esplanard. den we were afraid   SOMEONE   would get lost ;) den tt   SOMEONE   got irritated n started throwing taNtruMs. so xiao qi!  LMAO.  gwx rating Fireworks : 8/10 Overall Event : 6/10 ( due to sooo many ppl ) Overall thing ( + take MRT, + chatting, + walking around ) : 8/10 ( its nice; night life ) Percent regret to go : 30% Energy level when reaching there : 80% Energy level when leaving : 0.9999% Boredom during transport levels : 70% ( tho its nice to talk to kai man )  GCSE entry :  As I and my friends squeezed our way through the exceedingly crowded place at the esplanade, bound for the much-hyped fireworks festival, I starting having doubts about whether I had make a right choice in coming in the first place. I was starting not only to feel my sweat dripping down my shirt, and getting me all sticky, but I was also starting to feel very humid, very hot and felt very exaasperated. Not only did I feel faint and sickly, and my legs feeling tired from all the standing and walking, but also, I could not see clearly what was ahead of me, as the path I was walking was sloping. Neither did it help much with my 1.7m, 'exiguous' frame. The gruelling journey to the area around the 'funfair' ( which was set-up to cater to those who came ), was arduous but we preservered, finally walking through the fun fair with nothing much to see anyway, and feeling even more tired.  As my legs started feeling wobbly and about to give way, I and my friends settled for a place to sit. Finally. Even though we could finally rest our fatigued and enervated bodies, there was still half an hour to wait. Half an hour of excruciatingly painful boredom. But I was eager for the fireworks show to start. I wanted it to started this very moment. I couldn't wait!  As boredom started to grip hold of me, Wei Ji complained about a parched throat and Wei Ji, Zhao Perng and Philip decided to look around for something to eat or drink to quench our thirst. I was not as thirsty and besides, had a half-full bladder so I decided not to drink anything ( and to think my bladder was so strong as to not require a toilette until I reached home, 4 hours later! ). But the rest were, and zhao perng had an insatiable appetite. Well I was neither hungry nor thirsty as I had my dinner earlier. So I just tagged along, gulping at the sight of the cost of the food and drinks there. Wei Ji was assuming a weird posture ( if interested, I can demo OOP! singlish! minus mark! ) and Kah Joon had the usual expressionless face. After they got their drinks, we proceeded to where we sat just now - we had earlier cleverly put newspaper on the coast facing the sea so as not to get ourselves dirtied by the sand.  Soon, it was announced that the fireworks was to start soon. I geared up my camera with the correct video and image settings, all the while, my heart pounding with excitement. I just couldn't wait for the show to start! At around 8:30, as everyone watched the romantique, surreal night-sky, hear the winds softly blowing against us all gently, as I gazed around me seeing eager and united faces, the fireworks started on a undifferentiated note. Soothing music poured into my ear, as the colours of the pyrotechnic display engulfed my eyes. I started recording, capturing this lovely moment on film.  The dazzlingly bright fireworks filled the night sky with delicate patterns, choreographed spendidly, going step-in-step with the background music, perfectly matched with the sounds of the fireworks shells. The display was the perfect surreal eye candy. It was alluringly warm and bright, but deafeningly loud. My heart pounded like never before. But I knew that I was safe; this was going to be the best fireworks show ever. The whole sky had burst into a place of brightness; the singapore sky was changing into a sky with brightness of extreme proportions. I held my camera where I believed the fireworks were; and did not take my eyes off the fireworks. My heart was playing along with the fireworks, my soul was drifting skywards, my eyes glisteningly bright as my pupils watched the pyrotechnic display, totally diminishing my enervated physical body.  The fireworks resembled fallen embers, the clouds swallowing us. My heart was singing, along with many others. A tear streaked down my face and I made no attempt to conceal or blink it away.... Once, when night seemed so long, when it seemed as if it was never to end, our hearts were connected intricately, but bonded to one another as we all took in the fallen embers; as we took in the night air, the fallen embers, the delightful atmosphere. For a moment that I shall never forget, we were one entity.

        *This initial entry will not set precedent for posterior blogs. Use of language will be less formal    Hey all &amp; welcome to my blog. First I want to make things clear that this blog contains personal remarks and animadversion and this is in accordance with my freedom of expression. Second, this blog is for fun, to improve my English and also to disseminate views and propergander. Lastly, my target audience is not only my friends at home, but also my friends abroad, in the UK, USA and Australia. Teachers and principals are not my intended audience.  To improve my English, my blog will have 2 sections. One section will be totally informal, and might even be grammatically wrong or contain colloequial ( or Singlish ) terms. One section will be GCSE-type, where formality and 'correctness' is the stress.  I am having a look at the CSS code for this template. CSS is not exactly my area of expertise, though I have worked with it ( for positioning ) a few times. Once I understand where things go, then I can safely put a taggie-taggie or the such here.  I hope you all will have a fun time here reading my entries. Have a nice day. Nemaste.
