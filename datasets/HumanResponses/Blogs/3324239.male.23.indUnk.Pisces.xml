      I realize it is a few days before the months end, but the month of May basically ends with a long weekend so I figgure I'd send out the ZCCNL early. Congratulations, it's a boy.   Disclaimer: Since the preepmtion of the ZCCNL in April due to my 'well of creativity running bone dry', I return to May with the well overflowing once again. This makes for an extemely long ZCCNL....and I suggest taking restroom and meal breaks at least every 20 minutes....    I will forgo the typical hellos and salutations this month and dive headfirst into my immature writings....keeping my fingers busy on the keyboard, since idle hands spend time on the genitals and we all know how much God hates that...   The past month has been ripe with do-nothingness and following the same old routine of 'wake up, go to work, alcohol binge, sleep' and get up to do it all again the next day. There has been nothing new happening recently, save for the night I spent with Sevendust, and the fact that I am now the sole resident of the middle section of my apartment! A party must be in order! No longer shall I be plagued by being woken up early (read: early is by my definition; anything before 12:03pm) by the damnable yapper dog downstairs, and neither shall I be upset by the taper-oo-ing by the blunt end of a broom as I indulge in Disturbed and the aforementioned Sevendust at 800 decibels. Jesus himself prophisied that a party must come to pass (It's somewhere in the back of 'Proverbs') and I really don't want to piss off the king of kings and lord of lords. So keep checking your email and messaging systems, because I need to throw a shindig soon, before an elderly couple moves into one of the three vacancies surrounding my abode.   For those of you who have been fortunate enough to receive the ZCCNL since the end of last year, you all know of my undying hatred for hippies. I finally struck back at them on behalf of all of us upstanding citizens last week when I was asked for some spare change by a group of them and their malnourished dog (whom I felt more pity for then it's human abusers). I was well on my way down inebriated highway, so I told them very loudly and slurredly to get a job.I wish I had've had the foresight to stop and explain mu openended order in depth...Why should I contribute to their laziness when all they contribute to my society is crowding the already bottlenecked sidewalks, putting forth a stench so bad it makes Sloth from the Goonies smell like rosebuds and grandma's homemade dumpling dinner in comparison, and of course the insessent drum circles in the park (Clayton and Travis: we need to grab some marching drums and 'join in the circle'...bwah hahahahahahaha!). I don't ask for the hemp lovers to compromise their beliefs, however is it too much to ask for them to wash their feet every once in awhile? I mean for God's sake, Jesus washed his disciples' feet, do the hippies think they are too good for Jesus? I will end this rant by starting a new one:   "Selling Out"   Oh God how I hate this phrase. I don't believe in it. Selling out is merely a term used by those people who are unsatisfied with their favorite sports/ music/ etc. all star's ventures. It is a copout, pure and simple. Don't agree? I really don't care.    Consider this:   Do you have a job? Do you get paid for your job? Do you ever get tired of your current job and wish for a better one to make some more money? Well my friend, YOU ARE SELLING OUT!!!! That's right, if you want to make more money at what you're doing you are a sellout by definition.    Hypothertical situation:   You work as a burger flipper. You hate being a burger flipper, and vie for a managerial position making more money. YOU ARE SELLING OUT!!!!!   I am mainly a music guy so I'll use that for my examples. If you are in a successful band you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. It's a no win situation. You can continue down your musical path and be pigeonholed and be swept into a genre that cannot be new and exciting, or you can change things up a bit, MAKE things fresh and exciting and be labeled a sellout. The love of making music or playing sports is really only partially what makes an althlete or musician do what they do. The other half is THEIR NEED TO MAKE MONEY IN ORDER TO SURVIVE LIKE YOU OR I DO. Face facts here, you damn well know if you were offered $100 to shill tasteless happy tarts or snackey smores you'd jump at the chance. Using the term 'selling out' is about as asinine as saying a bass guitar player sucks because he uses a pick.   I apologize for being preachy (wait...not I don't, screw you all....ha ha just kidding....sort of). If you disagree with my arguments, feel free to respond and perhaps I'll include an editorial in next month's ZCCNL. But I'll probably just end up wiriting about midgets and public sexual acts I see in bars.   This is Zach once again saying "Please don't add me to your block list."      Remeber, go to http://downiesroolyou.blogspot.com/ to read the ZCCNL anytime, anyplace!

      Starting at the end of May, I will be posting the ZCCNL (Zach's Crappy Crappy Newsletter) online here so all of you can enjoy it after the fact without having to save it and clog your email account (in my perfect little world, you all keep it and the laughs rolling rather then deleting it while rolling your eyes after seeing an email from me). I will still send the ZZCNL out via email, make no mistake of that. Until that day when all are one....  Z-Funk in the hizzay.

      ....So why do I insist on making it harder on all of you with my poor sense of humor and inane banter?  Ahoys and salutations to all of you once again, from me through the email newsletter that people, not unlike yourselves have deemed "Pointless", and "Utter Dumbs**ttery".  I come to you a few days early this month since at the usual time of my publication dates, I will be up to my scapula in teaching jobs. Thankfully I enjoy teaching and writing, otherwise this would be a hell far beyond anything most of us could comprehend and imagine. I imagine it would be somewhat like living in Hong Kong.  My life has maintained a steady dosage of busyness coupled with a Healthy Point Load [(c) 2004 Matt Vander Boegh] of servitude. Nothing has changed since June, so there fore I won't bore you by saying "I'm still working for my dad, teaching drum lessons, and pondering why my crack-whore neighbor continues to venture outside the comforting and opaque walls of her home when she looks as though Gollum has a female rival."  My commentary section of this month's ZCCNL deals largely with the holiest (in the loosest sence of the word) department store in the world.....Wal-Mart. Long have I been tempted to write an editorial on the patrons of Wal-Mart, yet my concience prevented me from doing so. Since I am devoid of most emotions these days, I feel no compunctions about ranting and raving about the oddity of my local Wal-Mart Super Store.  God created us in his own image. For some reason I find myself questioning that statement each and every time I walk into a Wal Mart. Either by some strange twist of fate, or perhaps God is just a jokester, some human beings look as though they survived the Crusades (it's too soon to say they survived the Oklahoma City Bombing) with nary but some physical disfigurement as a reward. I'm not any sort of racist (you can't be when you have a vivid hatred for every race equally, including your own), however I pose the following question: Why is it these poor souls always congregate at Wal-Mart? They both shop AND work there. I have the utmost respect for the 'normies' who work at Wal-Mart (Ricky: Thou art a King among Men). Please, I plead with you: Why must you have to be 80 years old and have facial hair no matter your gender to be a door greeter? (Resued joke ratio over the past two months: 2:2) I have seen a myrid of weirdos, ranging from Captain Fatback who worked in the photo processing department, to Necro Santa and Mastodon Woman, all the way to an 80 year old woman wearing a Playboy tanktop in January. I'm definitely NOT saying I am a GQ model and comparing myself with these people, I'm merely pondering the strange coincidence all these people feel they have to shop at Wal-Mart? I have concocted a list of possibilities:  1: Is it the family-friendly atmoshpere? I should think a hearty NO. I can just imagine a small child following around a person whose pants look similar to one of their parents...they tug upon this person's leg, asking for the nearest candy at hand....and when the person looks down upon the frightened youth with their third eye, hairline lip and sweat soaked wife beater the youngster exclaims "I wanted my mommy, not a monster!"  2: Integrity? Wal Mart did, afterall, remove all magazines with lewd and suggestive covers, as well as 'inappropriate' CDs. I must say no again. I doubt a huge corporation that puts three super stores in a tiny town would care much about integrity. Even the slightly more upscale patrons of Fred Meyer has Wal Mart them beat in honesty and integrity. I overheard a mother and small child discussing whether or not the purchase of a toy was to be made. The little girl of a mere four years of age tugged on her mother's heartstrings by saying "I love you." The mother responded with "Do you only love me because you want the toy?". The girl smiled and nodded. The mother shook her head and said "Well, at least you're honest. Put it in the cart." Is this something Wal-Mart would posess? There's a great chance of it, but I'm going to stick to my guns and say NO!  3: Cheapness? I would say yes to this. Although Wal-Mart could quite possibly be included in the next reprint of the Bible as the 8th deadly Sin, it is nigh impossible to beat Wal-Mart's low low prices. And Roll Back sales.  There. I suppose I answered my own question by writing my twisting, nonsensical newsletter. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to join my mutant brethren at Wally World, so long as they remember to wipe the mucous ozzing from their three fingered hands off the fresh fruit they just decided to grope like an underage prostitute. This is Zach, as always saying "Please don't add me to your block list."

      I must apologize for my tardiness in sending out the June edition of the ZCCNL, however my schedule has been quite hectic and bothersome. I am juggling about three different jobs now, I'm still working for my dad part time, teaching my drum lessons in the evening, and now that summer is here, my instructing jobs are in full swing. Thankfully I will be sitting pretty in the money department after all this is said and done, but at the moment I find myself praying that I can die....even for just an hour or two. Hell, Nikki Sixx and Dave Mustaine did it, why can't I? All dying does is make you more popular and famous. Then I wake up from my unrealistic daydream with a start and realize I could have gotten more music written instead of rationalizing the unrational. The only solace from my toils have been the late night practices with my band and my three boxed DVD sets of Futurama. I have that theme song so embedded in my head now, I hear it when I sleep and have wonderful dreams of 'killing all humans'.   Speaking of killing all humans, my 'gripe' section of this months ZCCNL is derived from the construction jobs located in Boise ID. For those of you not from this turd magnet dubbed the 'City of Trees', you simply cannot drive ANYWHERE in the city without having multiple stops due to a mongloidian construction worker, or at least have traffic slowed to 15 mph, not to mention down to one lane of traffic of course. Each time I get in my car, I am constantly confused about the traffic situation, and in between my bouts with road rage I find myself pondering just why Idaho seems to have a construction fetish. I am quite bewildered why the city doesn't focus on one project at a time...wouldn't that speed things up a bit? Perhaps I use too much logic, or perhaps my loss of hope in the human race due to getting scammed on ebay twice, and the fact crapTV(c) reality shows continue to flourish makes me bitter against anything people do. I choose the latter. But seriously, why cant they at least hire competent people to direct traffic? Seriously, those people wouldn't know their heads from the patch of melanoma on thier cankles. I apologize to anyone who works construction or knows anyone who does, but I think at least getting through the 3rd grade should be a requirement for this job. If they have gotten more schooling then that, they certainly could have fooled me. I was driving through some construction (I forget where exactly I was since every $^@%#$*! road has construction being done on it) and the traffic director ran in front of me, waving and pointing at his sign. I slammed on my brakes to avoid a head on collosion with the worker. He gave me a dirty look and pointed at his sign. I nodded and pointed at his sign as well, since it read 'Slow'. He got the point and turned it around to the side that read 'Stop'. I realize that everyone makes mistakes...but since he pissed me off, I wanted to throw my Super Sized Dr. Pepper at him as I drove past (He also started waving frantically at me when I wasn't moving despite the fact he had neglected to turn the sign once again, thus reading 'Stop'). If I didn't have easily remebered liscense plates I most certainly would have.    I am going to end this poor excuse for a newsletter now, I realize I have hit rock bottom since I been reduced to complaining about traffic. Perhaps I can once again return to complaining about something good in the future. This is Zach, as always, saying "Please don't add me to your block list".
