      i realized that everything i've posted so far is pretty bitter. i'm really not an angry person at all. i just happened to be in a bad mood. i sound like the total opposite of who i really am. not gonna apoligize, because i'm just being me. i just wanted to explain that i normally am a nice, friendly, happy (generally) person. everyone has their days :)

      hmmm. went on a blind date last night. first time i've ever done that. it was... interesting. got a good meal out of it. sushi. yum. the guy is nice enough, but i'm not attracted to him AT ALL. seems to like me a bit, though. how do i tell him i'm not interested? i would love to know. just came home from a bbq at my parents house. luckily my dad is in california. it was mom, stel, max, and his girlfriend kim. if she married him, her name would be kim kimbrough! i think it's funny.  anyway, i'm just rambling. nothing important to say. saw farenheit 9/11 yesterday. it was amazing. i think everyone should see it, democratic or not. it was very powerful. i felt emotionaly drained when it was over. very proud of myself for not crying. was close a few times, but no tears (which is rare.) i guess that's it for now. if i think of anything revelent to say, i will be back.

      well, i've noticed that a lot of people who blog here write like they are expecting someone to read what they have said. fuck that. i don't care whether or not anyone reads my thoughts. actually, i would probably be happier if no one did. others are writing like they know they already have an audience, and they really care what they think. i am writing for myself. so screw all of you pretecious assholes. sorry, i'm just annoyed in general right now. although, aqua teen hunger force is about to start, so i should be ok in a minute. funny show. carl's my favorite character. he cracks me up. so i'm gonna go watch this show and go to bed, cause i have to wake up at 8:15 for the 9th day in a row.... god that sucks.... so, good night my imaginary readers. sweet dreams if possible.

      rain, rain, go away. come back another day..... i'm in the middle of a thunder storm, and it fits my mood perfectly. i'm bitchy, horny, depressed, and pmsing. sounds like fun, eh? missed out on a concert b/c i couldn't stop crying and didn't want to go into public b/c i felt fat. been wallowing in my misery all afternoon/night. and i have come to the conclusion that i have, indeed, had my first one night stand. if you have read my last post, i believe i mentioned a boy i slept with down the shore who had an HUGE cock. well, we have talked many times since then, on aim and through text messaging on our phones. but everytime i try to set up a date to see him again, he is unavailable. i've never had good self confidence, and this is just reinforcing it more. i think he was horny, and just wanted to fuck. that's cool with me, but i wish we could be friends and hang out. i feel like a slut now. i'm not looking for a relationship or anything, but i can't help feeling used. it's a shame. oh well. i'll get over it.

      hmmm. it could be because i'm kinda tipsy (sarah and i just drank 2 pitchers of blueberries, mango, vokda, and blueberry schnopps,) but who knows. i feel bad about the whole mike thing. i still don't know if alyson is still mad at me, but really, the last time they fooled around was over 2 months ago, and who knows how long before that. still, i don't want her mad at me. but on the other hand, i would like to at least get to know mike (so i don't feel like a total slut for sleeping with him so soon,) and i hope we can still foor around. we shall see. i just wish alyson would be honest with me......

      so, on july 10th i went to ocean city, maryland with sarah, mandy, alyson, and nicole. we stayed there for a week. it was the first time since last august that i had more than 2 days off from work in a row. it was great! we were pretty much drunk the entire time. went to the beach everyday. i got a tan (for the first time in my life.) we saw dolphins on two different days. there was a tornado warning on one day. went to seacrets, which is this really cool bar/club. it was right on the beach. there were about 10 bars, two floors, two live regae bands, and a dance club with a dj downstairs. it was awesome. also went to a bar where you could play beer pong. pretty sure that's illegal b/c it incourages drinking, but it was still cool. garth came down with rob for a few days. we (garth and me) fucked on a life guard chair one night, then in the sand on the beach. after that, we walked back to the house, continued drinking and partying. and then the cops showed up. alyson went to jail  for a noise disturbance (her name was the one on the lease), and sarah had smoked a bowl about a minute before the cops came, and she got busted for possesion. they spent the rest of the night in jail. then rob and garth got into a fight, and broke a lot of  stuff. there was blood all over the place. they were cool the next morning, though. after garth and rob left, later that day, alyson's friend mike came down. he's really hot. we flirted a lot that night, then had sex for 3 1/2 hours. we were up until 6am. and let me tell you, he has the BIGGEST dick i have ever seen in person. seriously, he could easily be a porn star. his cock is huge. kinda felt like a slut the next day, but we have kept in touch, and are going on a date tomorrow so we can get to know eachother. oh yeah. alyson and mike got tickets for jay walking!!! how stupid is that?! all in all, it was a great trip.

      okay, so i just got back from a pseudo date thingy. and it was quite possibly the worst experience of my life. this guy was a total ass. first, he told me he was far from 30 years old. well, he looks about 35. and he wears clothes that look like his mom picked them out. by the way, his name is simon, so if you meet anyone online with that name, be wary. to continue, he argued with every single thing i said. he would ask me a question, and then i would answer, and then he would rant for 5 minutes about how stupid and wrong my opinion was. he's also really cheap. didn't even pay for my $7.71 sushi and miso soup. then, when i get home from this horrifying evening, there is an im waiting for me from him. i only read the first sentence (out of about 15), and he said i had serious issues i needed to deal with. so of course i feel like punching someone. instead, i sent him an email saying basically: fuck you. who do you think you are to judge me. i've known you for probably 2 hours. don't ever try to contact me again.      and that's that. never again will i ever meet anyone i ever met online

      well, here i am, killing time.... my friend liz is throwing a HUGE party tonight, but it doesn't start until 11:30. said i should invite everyone i know. there's gonna be a lot of people there :) anyway, i've been sick the last 2 days, and it has sucked big time. missed work yesterday, and left early today b/c i was pucking my guts out. fun fun fun. feel better at night. why is it i always get sick? it's not fair. stupid immune system. my boss told me his mom has had a stomach flu for the last 6 weeks, which doesn't sound promising. oh well. i'm strong when it comes to getting over being sick (knock on wood.) in the middle of a six feet under marathon. it's been great so far. also waiting for friends to come over, and then we're gonna head over to liz's. anyway, just thought i would drop myself a line. it'll be interesting to read this a year from now. ahhh, memories....guess i'm gonna go now. later.

      so, this weekend was very surreal. you won't totally understand unless you know my friend brooks. i went to cape may with him for the weekend, for his mom's family reunion. let me first explain that brooks is kinda nuts. a really nice, sweet, funny guy, but totally nuts. he is bipolar and has adhd. ok, so the reunion.....  imagine 50 people, and about only 15 of them under 30 years old (counting the children.) then imagine them all acting like brooks, and being piss drunk. that will give you some idea of how my weekend was. don't get me wrong, it was a lot of fun. but soo weird. the first night we were there, brooks's dad walked head on into a wall (drunk.) the husband of one of brooks's cousins (40ish old) asked brooks if we could have a 4 way (gross!! cousins!!) another one of his cousin's, george, hung out with us a lot. married with 2 kids at least 7 years old, this guy is quite possibly the biggest stoner i have ever met. woke brooks and i up at 7 in the morning b/c he wanted to smoke pot with us. the three of us and 3 other realitives went to a gay bar (without knowing it) on saturday. that was fun. then george grabbed my ass, and in private told brooks how much he liked my tits. hmmm. and brooks's sister's boyfriend talked to brooks about how he could tell i wasn't wearing any underwear, and that he totally approved, and wanted to know who's idea it was for me to go out like that. and don't even get me started on the family pictures. you would have to have been there to fully appreciate everything that happened, but trust me, it was a very, very weird weekend.

      i just woke up and couldn't figure out what day it was. it was 8:50, and dark outside. thought i had to be at work in 10 minutes. then, i figured, i couldn't have slept 14 hours straight w/out waking up once. then i did the rational thing, and looked at my cell, which told me i had only been sleeping for two hours. don't know whether i'm happy about that or not. been watching depressing movies all day. in the middle of  the pianist right now. what's wrong with me? i think i have begun to realize that i really do need someone now. not just a friend, but a relationship with someone who gets me. alas. i have no hopes right now. everyone i'm seeing for one reason or another could never be a steady partner. what to do, what to do? i want to be in love, and have someone love me back. god this is depressing me even more as i read it. i'm pretty pathetic. i have so much, yet so little. listen to me. i sound like such a fucking loser. eerrrggghhhhh!!!!!

      this is gonna probably be short. as the title says, i don't have much to say. just kinda felt like talking. thank god (or who/what ever) i don't work tomorrow. i seriously need a day off. i feel like wcv is draining the life out of me. tuesday i work 9-10 (which is gonna suck ass, but i need the money.) have a job interview in customer service on wednesay. hopefully i'll get it b/c it pays much more than i'm getting now. now i'm 100% sure mike was a one night stand. trying not to feel cheap. keep your fingers crossed for me :)  whatever. i really don't care too much. he was cute, and a good fuck, but too young, and it's not like i'm looking for someone serious. but still, it is kinda poopie. se la vive. ass. i say that with the kindest intentions. anyway, that's all, folks. peace.
