        This was an interesting weekend.  But before I start my story, I have noticed the lack of giant fighting robot action in my adventures of late, so I decided to make this the giant fighting robot post.  This post is taking longer than I thought it would, so I am going to finish it off soon probably with pictures.  Az

        I am thinking of writing a musical, well not really wiriting a musical - merely re-wording somewhat popular songs to fit to whatever topic I deceide on.      That has nothing to do with anything, that was more a tribute to Randomness.      This week has been interesting, although not to much has happened, I think I have rejusted back to University.       So as i said not to much has happened in Alandia, I went to an Auction, did a research thing for psyc, learnt i was a thinking thing and took a stance against the over use of capitial letters.      So I am going to do what any good television producer does, when they run out of ideas and can't be bothered with spelling or grammer. Yes i am going to do, one of those half arsed memory episodes, all i need is some chimes and some bad special effects.      Ohh here is something interesting....      Once upon time in the wonderful land of Indro, there lived a boy with a 3 letter long name. His name was Adz, he and Az where good friends and did lots (stupid) stuff together. But i only have the attention spand to write like this for a relatively short period of time, so i will only be telling about one certain set of events.       Adz was excited.

        Welcome back to my world, although not too much has happened since I last posted.  However I have made another web page. I think this says ether of two things about me; I compensate my lack of adventures in the real world by writing about my previous exploits on the internet I have become a web page making slut  Ok, my second web page might have been compulsory for Microbial and Molecular Biology, but it could be a sign of things to come. Who knows I could become the next Rupert Murdock (right now, if you don’t know me you’d be pretty confused about that last comment, but it doesn’t really matter just start laughing – no one will know that you don’t get it).  Anyway if you wondering about the title of this post, our site was called Britney Spears teaches Bioinformatics (No… his title’s and his posts are starting to relate to one another)  So far I have used 3 words in entry that will assure plenty of people coming onto my page, Britney, Spears and Slut all I need to do to become ultra popular is mention two more words; Sex and Nude.  We decided on naming Britney in the site’s title only because she is apparently the most searched female on the web but mainly Anna Kornikova was too hard to spell.  Can’t be bothered writing anymore….  Az

        Yesterday I told you about my progression into Hippy-ness, but there was been some developments in the time sinse I have posted      Back to the topic of me being a Hippy.  After the events of last night it seems I have a hippy alter ego, like Yugi has an alter ego who is an ultra cool, slightly taller, card playing ancient pharaoh. Sadly my alter ego isn’t ultra cool or slightly taller or has his own television show and range of merchandise. No my alter ego seems to be the unholy child of Beck (the much loved 70’s styled artist of the mid 90’s) and Shaggy (from Scooby doo)  I think I may gain some amazing Hippy Powers when I metamorphose but all I can remember was the uncontrollable desire for Pizza, to have my hair put into dread locks and more importantly using the words ‘like’, ‘man’ and ‘dude’ far to much.  As I was saying last night was a blur, but when I woke up this morning I found I was wearing flares, had written and recorded several songs promoting scientology, solved the mystery of the Indooroopilly shopping center and had taken out a patent on a catch phrase.  But this left me with a question how I transformed? Was it because of the half moon or the 18th birthday or had I been bestowed with the power of Hippy-ness in the same way the power rangers had power-rangerness bestowed on them.    I am not sure we will just have to wait and see.  But on a unhippy related topic i have to talk about music.  i love music and atm i am enjoying Safri duo, Robert Miles, the blue man group, Simple Plan, Millencolin, Bomfunk, Beethoven and Mozart  this hasnt got anything to do with anything i was wanted to mention my play list on sonic stage 2  Well that was me procrastinating and avoiding studing  Az

           Personally, I think I am boring    Far too boring to warrant an Internet Journal about myself.    Nevertheless, I have nothing better to do.    You have been warned.    So don’t come crying to me when you realise that my actual life does not at all live up to my site’s name.    Hi and if you haven’t guessed my name is Az.    Actually, my name is Alan, being called Az is just one of side effects that growing up in beach town had on me. Apart from being blessed with name that resembles the peak of the Bogan culture, there is more to me than a single syllable.  I was thinking of putting my “getting to know Az” Information in bullet form but Stories are just so much more fun.    Az - the Boy with a Monosyllabic Name
