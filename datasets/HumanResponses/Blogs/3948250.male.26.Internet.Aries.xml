       Well, I hear that Ramy and Micha are interested in knowing how I did the DVDs in Nero.    Well, technically it's really not that hard, but it requires that you sort of know the program. so... here are some steps to take, and some explanations of the different DVD components.   1- First when Nero is installed on the computer, you need to make sure that the DVD burning license is installed, otherwise, it will not allow you to capture video from a DV cam in DVD format.     2- Once installed, you want to open StartSmart and click on the DVD icon on top, then click on Photos and Videos and click on "Capture Video". At this point, your camera needs to be connected and turned on, click record, this will record the video from the cam tape to your hard drive. you want to make sure you have at least 5 Gb free on your hard drive.    3- After you're done capturing, click next, and it'll show you the video you just captured as being the first title, you can add more titles laters (these will show up as the top menu on the DVD).   4- Right click on the title and click on edit, to edit the video. This will take you to a screen where you can add text, take out pieces of the video, rearrange scenes, add transitions and effects.   One thing to note there is the scene detection, the scenes will determine the points where you can insert breaks... to do this, just right click on the video, and select, detect scenes, that will take a while, but after that, you will see a (+) sign by your video so that you can expand it and see the different scenes. You have to play around with that to figure out how to cut scenes. mostly, it's just drag and drop stuff. Pretty simple   5- One you're done editing the video, you have to click next, to create the chapters of your video, now on the screen of the titel, you just have to click on "Create Chapters", then you will be directed to a screen where you can play your video. You can create a chapter by clicking on the little icon right under the screen, it's red, and looks like a finger or something (if you put your mouse point on it, it will tell you what it's for.).  6- After you're done creating your chapters, now you're ready to deisng the main look of the DVD. when you click next, it'll show you what the design looks like. You can add a background video, background music, animate the menus. Onece you're on the menu, it's actually pretty simple to figure out all that stuff out. WHen you click next, you're going to see a preview of what the DVD's going to look like. You can actually play it and everything, you can always click back to edit any part of the DVD.   8- Once you're done with verifying everything, click next, and choose the burner you want to burn on, and click burn. and voila, you'll have the DVD all ready to go.    Remember, the transcoding process, and the burning process take quite a while, especially if you have a full DVD and animated menus, so don't panic if it takes forever. Hope this small guide will help you make your own DVDs, or help or help michel make his :)

       Man, today was quite a day for us at work. I think everyday until Jarod and Darren come back is going to be a new adventure.   This morning, I had permissions problems with user's folders, and I had to reset permissions on about 1300 accounts manually. Then we found out that there was some crazy rule in our mail server that was bouncing mail back. in case you don't understand what that means, basically, it's that people couldn't receive some legit mail on the servers. We did fix it though after all !! so we're excited, about 14 days to go, then we'll be back to normal.  peace out!

       Today, I was looking at my plants, and I saw 2 of the plants that are a little sad...&nbsp;   Mich... take a look at this, what do you think? you think this is cuz they're getting too much water? I was thinking maybe changing the watering cycle to once a day for 5 minutes?    urlLink       urlLink

       Today, was a crazy day at work. I  guess I should've expected that being gone for 2 weeks on vacation with all the stuff piling up, waiting for me to come back.    It's all good though, I'm slowly getting back in the pace of work, and hopefully will finish up some of the stuff I need to finish. with school starting, more and more work is coming up.    as of Thursday, Jarod and Darren will be in France, so that'll be an interesting 2 weeks for us, i can say one thing, I'm not looking forward to it :) .

       Well, today was family's last day here. it was sad to see them leave, since we had a lot of fun having them around. I guess Nana was excited to get back home, but sad to leave US back here. it's ok though. soon enough, we'll be together again... next time, we're going to go to visit Germany first before going to Lebanon. so that'll be a fun trip to take next year... or the year after.   as for me and Christina, we're enjoying our last few hours of vacation before we snap back to reality and go back to work. yikes!!

       Today, was, what I would call a nice ending to a vacation. it was very kick back: we went to Patty's house, and we BBQ'd some sheesh kebab's, and did a lot of swimming and karaoke. we didn't stay too long in the evening, as Michel, Nana and Farid had to come pack, and I still had some DVD copying to do.   if you want to check out all the pictures of the BBQ, click  urlLink here .   urlLink

       Today, was quite an eventful day actually. we left to Six Flags Magic Mountain around 10:30 am, and we were there till about 8:00pm. needless to say, we were pretty tired by the end of the day.&nbsp;   Mom got so scared on the first ride, that she didn't want to go on any other ones, so we were looking for the little "tea cup" rides, or the horses on that platform that go up and down :-p . nah, just kidding, but she did sit out for a few rides, while we go on the thrills!!   we went on this one ride and we got so wet, it took us the whole day to get dry. check  urlLink Michel &nbsp;out ,&nbsp; and  urlLink Fido  .   The best ride, was the  urlLink DejaVu . so scary, but so much fun!&nbsp;   In the evening, we had an episode of " let's try to find something open to buy food :)". we ended up at Rubios Baja Fresh... Very good stuff.   If you want to see the whole album for the day, just click  urlLink here

       i love playing basketball. the part that sucks about it is that you're always prone to get hurt. yup, and for some reason, I always end up being it. today was especially bad. We were playing in Brea with Bunty and a bunch of other guys, and all the hits that could've possibly happened, actually happened to me. First one was a hit on the middle of my head by some guy's elbow ... [ouch] ... that hurt like hell, then Erick, with his crazy moves, and me being insistent on blocking him, hit his full head on my cheek, I felt all numb in 1 second, and that immediately gave me a very nice (NOT) headache. being persistent me, I decided to tough it out and keep playing, until I decided to land on my ankle, and sprain it, 3 in 1 , in one day... sounds like fun, actually... it was ... only fun and painful :)  Thinking back, I really had nothing more interesting to talk about other than me being injured... pretty pathetic huh? oh well, I spent a lot of time this weekend working on the website for my family, and setting up an online (yahoo-like) links engine which is pretty sweet. if you're family, you can check yours at  urlLink http://www.foreignkid.com/pmythreads  , and if you're not, you can check the public links engine at  urlLink http://www.foreignkid.com/mythreads . Please feel free to submit any additional links that you think are a cool addition..     Cheers

        I hate freeways!!  For some reason... it doesn't matter how good of a driver you are... you can never be too careful. this past friday, I was going with Christina to our friend's place which is barely 20 minutes away, and as we're driving there, some dude driving in the lane next to me drives over some torn piece of tire, and that piece flies out and comes right in front of me to hit my car... it sounded horrible. I almost thought I was going to lose control of the car.. needless to say it was scary!    When I got to my friend's place, I was looking to see what damage was caused, and my license plate looked like it's been chewed up by a dog and spit out... it was rather ugly, and there was some small scratches on the engine cover.. nothing that can't be buffed out though.do ... I'm glad it worked out ok.   ok so I decided to put in a cool new link every day for those interested... you might know about them. and you might not... so here's today's:    urlLink Do It Yourself Network  hope you enjoy it.

       Since I don't have too much about me to contribute today, I figured I'd leave to really nice and useful links at the blog for nice SHOPPING!! ready? . here they are:  urlLink http://www.bensbargains.net  and  urlLink http://www.slickdeals.net  I strongly recommend that you visit those, because they can in very handy when you're looking for something, or in fact, when you're not even looking for something and have a few pennies to spend.  Today, I reduced my likelyhood of getting in an accident, as I bought an  urlLink earpeace  for my Nextel Phone. So far, it's working awesome. it only has a PTT (push to talk) button on it, but if I set my phone up right, I can actually call people with just that button, without even getting to my phone... pretty snazzy for driving.  Well, that's the news for today, come again tomorrow, to see something new.

        urlLink NIP/TUCK .... that's the series of the week apparently. Christina happened to borrow last season on DVD, and we've been hooked on it. I'm not sure if a guy is supposed to be hooked on a drama like  urlLink NIP/TUCK ... I though it was actually a pretty good series, but my wife was just going so far with it as to watching about 5 episodes a day after work. It's very rare that I see her actually stay up later than 10:30pm to watch TV. but that did for her. oh well !  today is at my interview at Cal State Fullerton, and since I've never really had any "real" interviews, since I've been stuck at APU the whole time I've been in the US, i'm a little nervous. the good thing is that I don't really care whether I get this job or not, as I have a secured job here at APU anyway. so whatever happens happens!  Man, it's been about 5 days that I haven't posted any pictures... well I guess i've been busy working on my offline albums organizing them so that I know how to find my pictures everytime I want to show somebody a certain picture. having 2500 pictures make it a little hard to manage without correct organization. Well... today I have some work to do, so I need to get my butt in gear! Peace out!

       Well, today, was an interesting day. Church was a long day. for some reason, I was more tired than usual. the interesting part of the day was actually Jackie and Ted's good bye party. They suddenly decided to move to Canada from Chino Hills. it was pretty sad to see all the people from Young Life say how Jackie and Ted impacted their life. it was a pretty emotional moment. the best thing is that they're really excited about it, and really that's what matters.  Other than that, everything is slow. tomorrow is another day at work... Peace Out
