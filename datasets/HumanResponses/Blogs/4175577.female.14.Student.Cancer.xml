       today was my very first day of high skool, and personally i had a blast!! i got lost a couple of times but i eventually found my class..es, classes. and i met these really cool people one of them her name is Sasha, Stephanie, Meagan, Linda, Ashly, Danny ((not really considered a friend, more of an aquiantance)), Cha-Cha, Nicole, and Tex. yeup those are all the friends i made today:) i thought my first day of high skool was gonna be terrible and crowded and i wouldn't be able to find my classes...someof it did happen but it ended up bein pretty cool. so far i love theatre arts already, and i don't know whether i should try out for the first production "The Laramie Project" i don't know if i could open up to people on stage or not... but i wanna try it, does anybody think i could do it??? i dunno but i gotta go cuz my ass hurts from sitting in the chair so long, and i wanna get up.       I LOVE MIKE      goo-bye.
