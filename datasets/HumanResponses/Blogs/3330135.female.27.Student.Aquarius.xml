     So, last night, we rented videos (like I needed to spend the evening in front of a screen after my whole day on the net...). And, just like that, out of the blue, I thought: "it's about time we see Dogville". Because strangely enough, no matter how much we like Lars Von Trier, we always seem to drag it forever before we watch his movies. There's always something about "we're not in that kind of mood right now... how about a mainstream american comedy? no danger there..."  Anyway! We took it. And it turned out to be an absolute masterpiece!!! Yes, everybody else said that, but I'm not much for film critiques... I very rarely agree with them. At first, we were wondering what this theatre-like setting was about, and thinking that we'd never get caught in it. But after a very short while, we were like swallowed by it. I got so much into it, and so upset by what happened in it that I almost had to leave the room!! (I often do that... I have this strange ability to really live the lives of the characters... And don't come and tell me "it's just a movie!", that doesn't work with me...)  It felt sort of like a book... You get the story told, but plenty room is left for your own imagination to build on... Pretty fascinating, the power of our own imagination. I guess that seeing a movie like this makes you realize how braindead most of the others tend to make us...  The only think I keep wondering about is this whole "critique of American society" thing. When the movie came out, and all around the Cannes festival, all everyone kept talking about was the strong attack against Americans. But I must admit that I can't really see that.... A critique, yes. A violent one, certainly. But specifically to Americans? To me, this is directed to humankind generally...

     So, first thing this morning: we called the vet. Even though I have to say that I wasn't too much in for it... Not that Gaia didn't need to go, with constant bad stomach for the past month (regardless of our dietary change attempts). But, I sort of was rather negative towards the vet. I mean, first of all, I've been there once before where he just gave her a peniciline injection without giving me a second to say no (sort of forgetting that he's not there to take decisions without asking first). And secondly, well... he's sort of like everyone else around here: MAINSTREAM! Which means that he was probably gonna flip out the minute we'd say that we make food ourselves, and just loose it when he'd hear that she was vegan. And then, probably blame her stomach problems on that, trying to sell us his own industrial brand, and giving us some horrible chemical treatment for the next 10 days...  But no! He proved me wrong!! Nice surprise, for a change... He was very open, didn't make a single comment about the homemade part, (and disn't ask about details, so we disn't mention the vegan part... ;-) ) and then proposed a full lab analysis. That felt so good! He actually seemed to be the one surprised when we said yes to the lab offer (more than 2000 kroner).  It seems like he gets a lot of those people that just have a hard time treating their pet as  a full member of the family...

     Well, that was certainly a Sunday in front of the computer!! I have nearly spent the entire day trying to create a blog for my  family to share (we have what you would call... lost touch!). The thing  is that it has to be in French (since I'm French, and so is my  family...), and the blogging solutions are far from being as good as  the english (american) ones... I have been doing that since 5 this morning ( urlLink Gaia  woke me up because  of a very bad stomach (poor thing... we're definitely going to the vet  tomorrow, this has gone on for just too long!), and I just haven't been  able to go back to bed. Anyway! Time to go and experience the real world a little... (and I'm  sure my husband wouldn't mind if he could have access to the computer  for just about 5 minutes... I can feel him breathing in my neck!!).

     That's it! I just started to blog, and there I am going through one of my many times recurring existential crises. I chose "The grass is greener on the other side" as the name of my blog, and... here we go again:  Where should I live? This is obviously not the place... But now that I've moved so many times, I need to start to wonder if there's not something wrong with me, instead of the places where I live... But, then again, I've maybe just been unlucky, picking the wrong destinations? And what if I made a list (oh yes! a list! that sounds like a good idea... It's not like I haven't tried making lists before!!!)? I could  write on this list ALL the things that are important to me (meaning, the kind of things I think I cannot live without), and then I only have to find the place in the world that fits best with that list. And then, I just have to make it work. But what if it doesn't work? What if I'm not satisfied with my life there? There are no more excuses then!  can't go around saying "yes, but that's because this is not the right place for me". Because it would be the most fitted place (according to my list). But then I'd have to wonder about my list... Perhaps I've judged the wrong things to be of importance? But wait! I'm being pretty negative, here! What if it DOES work out? What if this is the way to find my little piece of paradise, the place where I belong, where I just feel home the minute I get there? But shouldn't I be smarter by now? I've sort of believed that many times before... I get a place on my mind, think it's paradise on earth, move there... and then get really disappointed and can't think of anything else than to get out of there. I should really start to learn from my mistakes (sometimes I think I do, though...).  But maybe it's just because I used the wrong criteria to pick these places?? Hmmmm..... Yes! I'm definitely gonna make that list! Can't harm!........... Or can it? I'll take the risk to get totally focused on a place again, and not do all the things I'm supposed to do  because I'd be spending my whole time looking things up on the net about what it's like to live in..... Quebec, for example! Yeah... I guess I have a pretty good idea that that's the kind of places my list would bring me to.... And what if it doesn't?? The question is: can I make that list so objectively that I actually won't be picturing a place already while making it?....  OK. I'm making the list.

     That's it! After many months of lurking into this blog business, I finally decided to get my own. I don't really know what the future of this will be... Will I just drop it? Like many of my other unfinished projects?  And how do I feel about the idea of people getting to read my thoughts? I'm not so sure yet... I guess that time will tell!
