      Well I don't really know what to write. I really want to film something. If you are reading this and you would like to be involved with a movie, LET ME KNOW! Oh yeah, it would help if you have a camera.   It looks as though I will be making quite a few dollars on this 6th grade video I am doing. I'm already guaranteed $300, and it hasn't even gone on sale yet. Hell, it's not even finished yet. Wow, all that money for sitting on my ass. I can't wait to see what happens when I get a real job.  Grades are up, I'm getting a new cell phone this week, and things are all around good.  I updated my profile so check it out or I'll castrate you with a rusty spoon.

      HAHAHAH! IM POSTING!!!!!  Wow. Softball sucks. I swear to god I am the only good player on the team. Or at least the only one who cares.  Its supposed to be fun, but I dont have much fun when we lose by at least 15 every game. My coach is fucking retarded.  Blah Blah Blah.... driving school sucks... 3 fucking hours of watching cheesy ass videos... "The D stands for DRIVE. The P stands for PARK." No shit.

      alrighty.. well i was just bored and thought i should post. i have been having major headaches for at least the past month and finally went to see my doctor today. they think it's just migranes, so they gave me a prescription, but they are not sure if i should take it because it could cause drowsiness which would make me fall asleep during class. and to make matters worse, aaron can't talk to me until next saturday. the only way that i can communicate with him right now is through email (which his parents acctually let him do) so he won't get into trouble doing that. only bad thing to it, i can never tell when he is going to email me and to find out if he did i would have to go check it constantly. hey, it's better than nothing. so i'm hoping that he will check his mail and get back to me, like he has been. yay! so we're just waiting for saturday to roll around and such. and today aaron's parents were supposed to talk to my dad about something, i think it might have to do with the whole calling long distance thing and such. well, they never talked, i thought that aaron's mom said she'd call between 5 and 6 my time, but she didn't, so i called there only to realize that after i was calling that it was 10 over there. hope they didn't mind or get mad. i think i'll call there tomorrow and see what's going on. dad told me to call there and just tell them they can talk to him then. we'll see what happens. damn i miss aaron.

      Ahhhh... the first post. I doubt i'll be posting in here more than in my LJ, but what the hell.  First things first, I am a human. I am male, 6' (about), dark brown hair, 180lbs (about), ice blue eyes, size 12 feet, I have an 8 inch long penis (I wish), and I am in love.  I set up this blog not only for all you curious readers out there, but for me to vent.  Sometimes I like to sit here and bitch about stuff, so if you dont like it, dont read it.  This blog might also be used for news about my latest film production, which is currently in very very pre-production.  Bye.
