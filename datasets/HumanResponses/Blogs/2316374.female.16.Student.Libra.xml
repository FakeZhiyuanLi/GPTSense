      &nbsp;The publishing on the [relatively] "new" blogger is retarded. Especially if one has a slow&nbsp;connection. How would I&nbsp;know this? Hmm... perhaps because my grandparents&nbsp;have the slowest dial-up connection EVER.&nbsp;Ugh. Anyway, the publishing part of&nbsp;posting just keeps&nbsp;going and Going and GOing and GOIng and GOINg and GOING and.... yeah...... it's frustrating. Perhaps it&nbsp;will work THIS time.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Well, taggie, I suppose while our dear RJ is in NM&nbsp;we can just use e-mail and cell phones for&nbsp;communication.&nbsp;No use in posting on this thing for only two ppl. Unless, of course, we have a conversation we feel Robert will be interested in when he returns. Oh happy day! ::chuckle:: 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;::messes around with html::
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  We   need   a     better       template .    This     one    is     retarded  .    
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Hehheh... fun... 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;I'm bored... all dressed up and no where to go, so to speak. I kept hinting to Troy that we should invite James and Matt over to watch a movie or something... but he wants to paint his trim in his room. Grrr. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;I had fun last night at "King Arthur." Matt's a great, intellectual guy. James didn't come so he and Troy didn't monopolize the conversation like they usually do. Me and Matt actually hit it off quite well and had some awesome conversations. Troy would make some remark and we'd just ignore him or roll our eyes. It's nice having one's intelligence, no matter how slight, appreciated. After dinner and the movie, we came back home to paint Troy's room and Matt stayed for an hour or so too. Troy kept tellin Matt to "stop checkin' her out, man. She's my cousin." and stuff like that (even though, as far as I knew, Matt WASn't) while I was painting, and I finally got exasperated and told him to shut up and Matt thought that was funny. Dunno why.... anyhow, Troy shut up so that was nice. 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Haven't heard from Joey yet, but Matt Jenkins called again today. *sigh* Poor boy. He's not going to UAH this year for some reason, but he IS moving out this fall and doin some sort of something.... 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Anyway.... gonna go do some quality quizillas.... ttyl!

      There aren't any really long one's on there right now.  They've moved away from the meaty topics for awhile to discuss movies and such.  And it only shows the last hundred posts or so.  I bet we could do a google search for "gay horse flogging" and come up with an archived discussion on homosexuality.  Now  those  were some crazy long posts.

       Just CHECK SOME O' THEM POSTS OUT! They're INSANELY long. (i THINK that's the right URL....)

 Anyway... AZ... wow, i have no time! I'll have to type it out on Xanga. And Julia was talking about Houston, not AZ. 120 odd ppl, 4 showers. Impressive. We had about 50 ppl in 4 showers. Crappy showers, but they got you clean. Until you walked outside into the sandstorm. Still slightly damp. Ahh... nothing like the feeling of dry, gritty sand sticking to you're [previously] clean, damp skin. 

 ANYHOW...

 I, also, despise the new setup, primarily because I can't as easily reference other ppls posts as I'm typing mine. Ugh. Letters of complaint....

 I WENT SHOPPING TODAY WITH MY MIMI! ::huggles Mimi:: Got lots of cute stuff.... Gap jeans and chapstick (i had a gift card for like $65! still have $6 on it, too!), Buckle button-down blouse, NYC pink sleeveless blouse and plaid skirt. I love the new styles. NYC is my new fav store. Mimi opened up a card with them which means DISCOUNTS and COUPONS for me! Whoot! We've got one at Madison Square. I'm going to work there. You just watch. MORE discounts! Ahhh! Smell the smell of money saved and new clothes bought! Yes. 

 That was incredibly materialistic and shallow....

 I smell speggetti!

 Troy is finally realizing that I'm not his baby cousin anymore. We went over to James and Matt's house (::winks at Matt::) last night and I asked Troy on the way there, "So what am I going to do while ya'll play catch?"  He responds, "Sit there and look sexy, flirt with Matt, I don't care."   He had commented earlier that he needed to take me shopping because I would look really hot in such-and-such and (to Mimi) "She looks really pretty tonight." My cousin rocks. Can't wait to get to FHU so he can introduce me to all his senior guy friends! 

 Again, materialistic and shallow....
 I have something I need ya'll's help on, relating to the repeated statedment in above post, but not now. I've gtg practice violin. 
 ttyl!

      Ha!  You should see the lengthiness of some of our SND posts.  It can get pretty crazy.  Interesting and stimulating, but crazy long.

Last night I found myself straying from the Gospel of Mark (my self assigned Bible reading) and into the middle of Isaiah.  Chapter 40 left me in awe of my Lord.  

 (Vs 21-23)"Have you not known?  Have you not heard?  Has it not been told to you from the beginning?  Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?  It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a tent to live in; who brings princes to naught, and makes the rulers of the earth as nothing." 

 (Vs. 28-31) "Have you not known?  Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth.  He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable.  He gives power to the faint, and strengthens the powerless.  Even youths will faint and be weary, and the young will fall exhausted; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength, they shall mount upon wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint."

      whoo hoo.  i am saddened that taggirl thought i couldn't handle this whole bloggy thing.  well, check this out.  BA-bam!  here i am.  and it took me far too long to get to this blog thing.  my computer is far too slow.  not to worry.  cause i'm in no hurry.  i am determined for my first post to be the longest one this blog has ever seen. so i'm gonna keep a'typin' til i feel that i have out-typed the other posts.  can't wait to hear something about AZ from cantora...so far, all i know is that is was, "awesome, very moving experience".."we helped soo many ppl"..."wow, i'm sorry, i didn't get enought sleep last night. ::nervous laugh::  like, anyways, i was, well, like...i didn't get enough sleep last night.  anyways...".  and that constitutes my entire knowledge of the goings on in AZ.  did you say some thing about the "anasazi" indians?  my crew will be visiting some anasazi cliff dwellings and whatnot...i was just wondering.  ok.  i win.  and its time for breakfast.  so ya'll just chill, y'hear?

      I liked the three way e-mailing just fine, but we can try this out.  Either way works for me.  Steff, I know you and I will take to this easy enough, but Robert is somewhat the newbie to blogging (as far as I know).  My only complaint is that I can't stand the new blogger set-up.  It's so much more difficult to use now.  The Dashboard is an object of loathing.
