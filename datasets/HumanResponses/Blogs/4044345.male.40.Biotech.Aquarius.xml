       It's true, people suck, but they make the best friends compared to all other earthly creatures.   Dogs are pretty cool but they can't roll joints or load you up a bong-hit or laugh with you while listening to the Phil Hendrie Show.  Ditto for cats, birds, rats, snakes, spiders, trees, flowers, cucumbers...  Hello, My name is  Alexander T. Newport . I am destined to be a famous philosopher within my mortal lifespan. I have written 3 books and predict that at least one of them will be published & available at Amazon.com in about 2 years.  I have been writing since 1979 and found my own voice &amp; style in 1996. I started my first book during the last week of 1993 and completed it late January of 1999. My 2nd book was started in the summer of 2002 and completed around May of 2003. The 3rd book was started early January of 2004 and completed earlier this month (although I am still tweaking it here & there).  Yea, I know, none of this means a damn to you....at least not yet.  All that aside, I'm here at blogger.com because I wanna make a few friends online to share things with; things like interesting links, mp3's, photos of pot plants, and whatnot.  Alright, that's it for now. Talk at you later.

       Sometimes it feels good to wallow in it. Just lay down on your couch or bed and sing along with that pity-party chorus in your head. Sing the blues.  Everyone’s got it better than you.  Nothing too good ever works out for you. Oh sure, you’ve had some good things and some good times…but it’s mostly been C-class and at best sometimes B-class… Everyone else gets the prettier, the faster, the top-of-the-line…but that’s because they’ve had to work hard for it. You don’t do shit. All you wanna do is fuck off, play on the computer, play video games, hang out at the pub, read, daydream, get high, eat, sleep, whatever, and it doesn’t bring you one inch closer to manifesting the kind of fabulous mortal life you wish you were leading.       Fabulousity, if it even truly exists, only exists for short periods of time. And when it exists, it only exists when you are not opposing or resisting or denying your mortal actuality. That’s right, it only exists during those sporadic & short-lived periods when you are content with yourself &amp; your personal history. It only exists when you are not expecting anything more from your own nature & destiny; when you’re not standing in your own way.        Mortal life really is like a poker game.     At birth you are dealt genetic cards and these determine your looks, your health, your talents, and the good/bad dynamics of your personality. You are also dealt cards having to do with what kind of environment you would grow up in... rich... poor... clean... dirty... calm... angry... superstitious... racist...kind...philanthropic...     And each day you are dealt mood & idea cards throughout the day...     And each day you are dealt events cards throughout the day...          Mortal life really is one moment at a time.        And you're destined to win some, and to lose some.     Neither one matters.     It's all a stinkin lie.     The prettier the carrot, the bigger the lie.     And you're the fool who believes that others have it better than you...        Those people whom you despise, those people you saw laughing & looking well-groomed, you don't know how much or how little they cry behind closed doors. You don't know what kind of hellish moments they have had to endure during their time as mortals. You only saw them while they were making hay in the sunshine.        My, but aren't you easily fooled by the Public Persona, the Public Mask...        It hurts to be human. All humans hurt at one time and another. You either kill yourself or make the best of your current situation. Waiting or looking for better situations is just chasing that old carrot on a stick.         Bite the bullet and cry when life hurts.     Have fun when you're not hurting.     Forget about finding some magical liberation from moments that hurt. It doesn't exist while you are here.     I know it sucks to read these words, but you already suspect that there is no magical or hard-earned liberation from bad moments. I am just affirming your suspicion. And I do so without believing you will believe it to be true. But I do it anyhow because I know you'll remember the gist of this particular blog some other day in the future. And you will be glad to remember it. The thing is, hardly anyone else is known for saying these things...Most everyone else seems to be singing the party line & encouraging you to pursue the unattainable when it would be nicer if you were just told to give up &amp; accept the fact that all mortal lives are bowls of ice cream with chunks of shit mixed in. Once you've realized that this is true, then you will bite the bullet and cry when life hurts, and you will have the bestest fun you can have when you're not hurting.        I am AL NEWPORT.     And I don't know jackshit...but I am impelled to write what I write.

       I don't like busy-looking websites or blogs. Can't stand all those links & ads. Can't even stand to see blogspots that have archive links displaying hundreds or even thousands of previous posts. When I see such links I think,   Who's got the time to read all your shit?   It is therefore my intention to keep this blogspot relatively clean-lookin. I will not allow more than 20 posts on this site. I will cycle &amp; recycle my posts. There will always be a mixture of old &amp; new posts.       With the exception of my profile page, I will not clutter my main blogspot page with links, ads, photos, or banners.      Pantera's  5 Minutes Alone  is playing on BrainGell.com right now...   (That is not an  ad,  it's just a fact.)      Alright. That's enough for now.

       Brother, the so-called  reasons  for your explosions don't matter. There can always be a reason and an excuse and a defense to "explain" why or how you became overwhelmed by your spoiled-brat emotions and got bummed out or came unglued. Oh sure, they're important to your ego, your vanity, but they are essentially meaningless because they don't solve anything. They're just names after the fact. Furthermore, they are dishonest. They are diversions. They distract you from taking responsibility for maintaining your balance. You can't expect to maintain your balance when you make it conditional upon how someone said or didn't say something---or, because someone's inflection seemed  iffy  or they averted their eyes or didn't reply to your email straightaway.    No, the "reasons", the minute neurotic details don't really matter. They only obscure the bottom lines:  You are a very disappointed mortal and you are generally anxious & scared of death &amp; of becoming friendless & ignored.     And you are very vain  .  That's all neuroticism is: It's just a fancy word for being extremely vain. Afterall, what but one's vanity would give even the tiniest shit about what others think of him &amp; his "products" & his character &amp; his personality & his looks? It's our vanity that makes us scared---scared of failing &amp; losing & being rejected or ignored. And yet, the people we like the most are the ones who basically don't give too much of a damn about what anyone thinks of them or their lifestyle or personality. And the "reason" they don't give a damn is because they have learned through &amp; through that people suck shit--- ALL people suck it (& eat it, too).        No one is truly trustworthy. Anyone can betray you. Anyone can become bored with you. Anyone can become annoyed with you. And the thing is, the ones who have realized that all people suck shit (and are nothing but selfish survivalists at heart) have realized this fact because they have faced themselves and admitted &amp; accepted that  they  are selfish & vain &amp; scared. And they have realized that it's been this way throughout the history of humanity.    Yes, and lord knows they tried to undo the "bad" genetic & cosmic programming and tried to be un-scared &amp; un-vain & un-selfish and all it did was turn them into basket-cases because they were basically denying &amp; resisting their mortal selves. THEY WERE TRYING THE IMPOSSIBLE. They were trying, very sincerely, to be something other than they actually are. So is it any surprise that they would end up loathing themselves and thinking about suicide? But nevermind, they eventually realized & concluded that what they are &amp; how they are is okay  no matter what negative thoughts tell them otherwise.  They have observed enough people and have redd enough biographies to see & know that all people are two-faced &amp; contain many sides to their personalities & sometimes become violent or perverted or obnoxious.    All people lie when it suits them. All people care more about themselves than anyone else. So, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Let 'em be. You don't have to like it---most of us don't. And yet, you're one of them. And you don't have to like you either. But you do. You know you do. You're the only one who can because you're the only one who has seen all of your various sides &amp; aspects & angles &amp; contradictions.    It's never too late to start being your own best friend. It doesn't matter what your daddy did or didn't do or what your shrink did or didn't do or how many pills you've taken over the years.  You can always start from  now  to be your own best friend.  And what kind of best friend would you like? Well, that's what you want to be to yourself.    Be honest. It is ALWAYS your fault when you lose your temper or patience. And you can only do these things when you have foolishly expected too much from other people or governments or machines or YOURSELF. It is ALWAYS your fault when you get depressed or angry or sad or disappointed. You have expected way too much. You have fallen hook, line & sinker for the advertising scam &amp; the public persona (the public mask). You have fallen for someone's Best Behavior and expected it to always measure up to that level. You expect too much from people & yourself &amp; your destiny.    Dig, you cannot control the contents of your thoughts or emotions or impulses, but you can indeed train yourself to disbelieve any negative thought---any thought that worries you or bums you out. You just refuse to believe it. You admit it, you accept it, and then you refuse to believe it. Sure enough it will fade to the background. But---and it's a big but---you must be honest: Do you truly want to disbelieve it or do you secretly enjoy fucking with those negative thoughts like we sometimes enjoy picking at scabs, scratching our rashes, popping our blackheads, and tonguing a sore tooth? Yea, motherfucker, you know it's true. And either way, whatever is true for you, it don't really matter in the end because you're gonna die and everyone is gonna forget that you even existed.  And that's a good thing!     So here you are in what is an obviously temporary & mysterious existence full of collective emotional chaos &amp; impulses & lies &amp; misinformation & conflicting desires &amp; a whole lot of other bullshit which is all destined to fade away & be forgotten---and yet you dare to take it all so serious and pretend that you can control &amp; order it only to end up a reclusive basket-case who beats up his belongings? Belongings, I might add, that at one time were "needed" & desired &amp; momentarily treasured...    It's all shit, dude. All of it & all of us. So relax. You've already failed. You've already lost.  LOOK WHERE YOU ARE.  Do you honestly believe that this place is a paradise for anyone? No, it’s not, it's a suckhole place precisely because there are bad times mixed in with the good.  There   are chunks of stinky, vomit-inducing shit in our bowls of ice cream!  And time &amp; time again we are fooled by the good times into thinking that the bad times are behind us forever & evermore. Fools. That’s what we came here to be. That's right, I imagine it would get pretty boring, spiritually speaking, if we only chose to experience the dreamgames that are totally happy &amp; painless---and therefore I can see why we would be attracted to a place like this!   This flippy flop of a ying/yang, pleasure/pain, existential   mindfuck   called the  human condition.. .    People. People who need other people to keep from dying of loneliness. People who need other people to laugh at their jokes & coo at their observations &amp; admire their biceps & applaud their artistic achievements. But people are too undependable to count on as a source of happiness or ego-boosting or emotional fertilizer. They are too unpredictable. They are too selfish &amp; conflicted. Each of them walks around with tiny timebombs waiting to go off: Tiny timebombs which make cancerous cells and release diseases & release "evil" impulses &amp; release hormones that drive you up the wall---AND, they also release songs & paintings &amp; happy moods & infatuations &amp; exciting obsessions... You're already in the madhouse. All of us are.  Those who look sane are only faking it.  So come on down and fake it with the rest of us. We're already destined to hate & reject you the instant that you fail to live up to our recockulous expectations, so don't sweat it. Be your own best friend. No one else can ever come closer. Refuse to believe the negative thoughts. Refuse to believe that you can escape your fair share of pain &amp; disappointment. And then make hay while the sun shines. Make your music. Write your witty words. Enjoy the hell out of that tasty cheeseburger or pastrami sandwich or pint of lager. Live it up! Bask in the sun. Dance in the moonlight. Run on the beach. Do whatever you like while you’ve got a break from the pain. And listen, tthe next time you're outside on the street wearing your goofy shades and walking to McDonalds just remember that everyone you see is a self-obsessed, quivering, desperate, needy & disappointed &amp; chickenshit scaredy-cat like you. It doesn't matter how cocksure or easygoing they look, believe me, their heads are full of arguments & resentments &amp; fears & delusions &amp; bad memories & selfish fantasies ---and, they’re also full of hopes &amp; wishes & dreams &amp; maybe even a few good ideas & insights. They're all just thinker-feelers like yourself---and they're all unsure about why they're here and what's expected of them &amp; what happens when they die. So laugh, little brother. Please laugh at our sorry asses. We're all just making it up as we go along. We're all just muddling our way through the best that we can---and that will never be good enough for those negative thoughts in our heads.  So fuck them.  They are nothing but pre-programmed lies to wind us up. Go ahead, try the Disbelieving Experiment. You'll see, if you stick to it, that it is safe & beneficial to disbelieve any &amp; all negative thoughts. But in order for this to work you must be unflinchingly honest with yourself and you mustn't ever expect the negative thoughts to stop assaulting & annoying you. They will always be here, little brother. Always. It's just part of the human condition. And so is all the other bullshit that we hate. And I know that sounds bad &amp; bleak, but let us remember that no matter how bad we've had it we have still lived on to better days when we have laughed and enjoyed good music & good food &amp; good sex & good sleep &amp; good joy from creating something. Yes. And it's been a joy for me to write these words and play the self-appointed part of the wise little know-it-all. I don't really know jackshit, but I sure have fun sincerely pretending that I do!
