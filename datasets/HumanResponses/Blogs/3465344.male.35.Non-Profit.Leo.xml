       The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a law meant to punish pornographers who peddle dirty pictures to Web-surfing kids is probably an unconstitutional muzzle on free speech. The high court divided 5-to-4 over a law passed in 1998, signed by then-President Clinton and now backed by the Bush administration. The majority said a lower court was correct to block the law from taking effect because it likely violates the First Amendment. In considering the issue a third time, the court did not end a long fight, however. The majority voted to send the case back to a lower court for a trial that could give the government a chance to prove the law does not go too far. The ruling in Ashcroft v. American Civil Liberties Union was the last of nearly 80 cases decided in a busy court term that ended Tuesday with no announcements that any of the nine justices would retire. The year’s marquee cases involving presidential power to deal with suspected terrorists were announced Monday and for the most part represented a loss for the Bush administration. Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo denounced the ruling.  “Our society has reached a broad consensus that child obscenity is harmful to our youngest generation and must be stopped,” Corallo said. “Congress has repeatedly attempted to address this serious need, and the court yet again opposed these common-sense measures to protect America’s children.”  Has technology advanced?    What law would have done The law, which never took effect, would have authorized fines up to $50,000 for the crime of placing material that is “harmful to minors” within the easy reach of children on the Internet. The law also would have required adults to use access codes and or other ways of registering before they could see objectionable material online. Kennedy said that filtering software “is not a perfect solution to the problem of children gaining access to harmful-to-minors materials.” So far, he added, the government has failed to prove that other technologies would work better. Dissenting opinion In dissent, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer said the law is constitutional and should be upheld. Restrictions about whom the law would cover and how it would be enforced “answer many of the concerns raised by those who attack its constitutionality,” Breyer wrote. "We are especially disappointed that Justice Clarence Thomas was on the wrong side of this decision," he added. Congress had tried repeatedly to find a way to protect Web-surfing children from smut without running afoul of the First Amendment. The justices unanimously struck down the first version of a child-protection law passed in 1996, just as the Internet was becoming a commonplace means of communication, research and entertainment. Congress responded by passing COPA, saying the new law met the Supreme Court’s free-speech standards. The ACLU challenged COPA immediately, arguing that the replacement law was every bit as unconstitutional as the original. The law has been tied up in the courts ever since. Ashcroft v. ACLU, 03-218. In my Point- As much as I think the porn law was something worth looking at we don’t really want to rewrite the constitution.  I believe maybe we should invent a V-Chip or something like that along with any software that is out there. I know a lot of parents have to bust their hump to survive so it’s hard on them to surf or watch what there children do on the Internet. So may be we could set up a group on how we could set the standards for the software and the hardware of our computers. I think The ACLU is getting to big for there own selves but that’s the way we are in this democracy. So lets go back to the drawing board and se if we can do something to fix this problem and stead of being republicans and democrats lets be parents and good Americans and work together.

       ISTANBUL, Turkey &#151; French President Jacques Chirac said Monday that our President went "too far" by saying the European Union should admit Turkey, and he added that Bush commenting on Turkish-EU relations was like a French leader commenting on U.S.-Mexican ties.   "If President Bush really said that in the way that I read, then not only did he go too far, but he went into territory that isn't his," Chirac said. "It's a bit like if I told the United States how they should manage their relations with Mexico." Bush met with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara before attending Monday's NATO summit in Istanbul, and he pledged to fight for Turkey's membership in the European Union. In a speech Bush made in Ireland before traveling to Turkey, Bush said: "Turkey is a proud nation that successfully blends a European identity with the Islamic traditions." "As Turkey meets the EU standards for membership, the European Union should begin talks that will lead to full membership for the Republic of Turkey," Bush said. On my Point I think that Chirac has had his say and doesn't know his hind end from a hole in the ground! I think the French are rude and ignorant people and they are the downfall of peace.  Basically wanting the terrorist to win the battle, over all much like the bull Chirac spreads. I think enough is enough and we aren't going to take any more and the time is here to say kiss my a-- France .

      BAGHDAD, Iraq - A defiant Saddam Hussein rejected accusations of war crimes and genocide in court Thursday, telling a judge in his first public appearance since his capture seven months ago that the real "criminal" was President Bush.  My Point- Well Mr. Saddam insane I think you need to sit back and listen to a little story.  The thing I don’t think you realize is that we were a country built on principals and rights of the common folks like the dogs and us you talk about.  I could set here and call you names, that’s the nice thing about us here in the good old USA  One of the men who made that possible is the first president who name is George Just like the guy who saw fit to give you a little lesson in humility.  The men and women who paid the Altamont Sacrifice did so because of their love for others, can you say that about those who died on your watch.
