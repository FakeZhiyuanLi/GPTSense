      I'm wondering when people--the ones that write fluff pieces or profiles or think up the slant for a personality piece--are going to get tired of using the "he's so uncool that he's cool" angle. AM I too cynical? I don't htink so. I'm just tired of "You know, this fellow is doing all the things we know are uncool, yet the net result is...well...folks, it's cool!"   Can we just, as a society, acknowledge that we all know that geeks are cool; underplaying anything is cool; independent loners, especially (not "even") when they don't wear the latest fashions, are cool. I'm tired of being told that contrary to what i might think, these things are actually cool.  thank you, i'm done.

      1. when the words mean something and the music means something and they interesect in a way that creates a third meaning.  2. when I drove to the funeral I prepared in that familiar way, setting out my clothes and accomplishments and shortcomings on a long laundrey line to reel out in front of assorted relatives.

      Lines heard or spoken on a recent trip to lexington, kentucky:   "Marj is a combination of a sense of whimsy, a sense of irony, and a sense of self-deprecation. Add it together and I don't  know what it adds up to. I adds up to Marj."  "I know things are fucked, and I'm having an affair. But I love my husband, and I want to express my love for my husband. And when I sleep with my boyfriend, I'm on. I want to make love to my husband. He can't get me started (and he can't finish me off), but i love making love to him and... you know?"  Lady in the pool, floating her little boy on a life preserver.   "I-64 west to Louisville. 64 connects to 65 north. 64 to the Simpsonville exit. Right after Simpsonville exit you'll see a colossal monument to Jesus, and that's Six Flags over Jesus. Which is the Southwest Christina Church."  "The best magnet I ever seen in my life: "I gave myself to Jesus. And now he never calls."  "Have you ever met anyone better than the baby Jesus?"  Lots of Christian jokes. Jokes? Jesus-related comments is more accurate.  Re the apartment in new york that an acquaintance had access to: "It's a perfectly lovely apartment. It could be lovely. But there is one closet that I believe a dead relative is currently living in. And the maid -- oddly, she doesn't live there but her underwear was drying in the bathroom. Have you tried six flags over Jesus?"  "Defiant toe action. Because the defiant toe is representative of a defiant due. I don't want a revolution in my toe." (What? Did I scribble that down right? I hope not. somehow the conversation ended with:) "I don't want to be at the intersection of lewd and lascivious, ever."  "I gained such a respect for Richard Simmons when he slapped a man -- a marine-type man -- who was laughing at him."  "I don't want you to point like that. Because you're too pretty to point."  "We've all done things that aren't morally fabulous. But."  "I just want someone inside me, doing something interesting."
