      Last night I was pretty tired so I went unconscious arounf midnight, expecting to only sleep until probably 10 the next morning. I freaking slept until 2 in the afternoon!! 14 whopping hours of sleep.   My mom made her yard sale rounds this morning and got some sweet stuff.  She found the Lord of the Flies official CliffNotes which is awesome, though I just finished the book two days ago... I'll sell it to a sophomore next year I suppose.  She also bought a kick butt CD player bundle that came with headphones and a cassette adapter for the car.  BUT SHE GAVE IT ALL TO MY SISTER!!! ahhhhhhg, my cd player doesnt even have anti-skip and the only thing it displays is the track #, not even how long the song has been playing.  ARGH, well I snagged her cassette adapter for my car because it's a lot nicer.  This gave me the idea of experimenting. I brought my cd player and my sister's into my car along with the cassette adapters and found out that the only thing wrong with my sound system was my cd player! I blasted some Yellowcard and I was overjoyed - No cracklin' speakers.   I checked out the Crimson and Veridian rooms (shockwave games) that Dan V. has in his blog, and they are pretty awesome.  I beat them both and only needed one or two hints.  Their only downfall is that sometimes what you have to click on is verry small and you'd never know to click on it, but other than that they're pretty sweet - check em out.  Chris and I drove around town today.  I got sick of sitting in the house so I drove to his house and picked him up after he finished his work at Waffleshop.  Raz and Jesse were working on their chem project so Chris and I didn't really know what to do, so we went and checked out Goodwill since it was close.  The only stuff we found was crap, except for a Disney Princess computer game I might just have to go back and get for my sister.    It was around 7 and I still hadn't eaten dinner so I drug Chris along to Burger King and I got the new Spicy Tender Crisp value meal... IM SPICY!! Oh man did it ever hit the spot.  Dry with ideas, we decided to go back to my house and play some driveway basketball.  The hoop was only about 6 feet high so it was kind of lame, but still fun. When that got old we went in and decided to watch a movie on our home theatre system SHAZAM! The 1990 version of Lord of the Flies came today from NetFlix so we watched that, we are sooo awesome.  The only cool thing about the movie was getting a more visual representation of the book.  It was pretty much just showed muddy kids running around in tattered tighty-whities.  After da mooovie  I took Chris home and cleaned my room.  GAAAHHHH wow I'm going to throw up, my cat dropped a major deuce and its poisoning the house. I should probably go take care of that.   Peace  Chad

      Today I got to drive to school and got there just in time.  Luckily I found a parking spot and made it in before the bell rang. I don't have to take the bus anymore holllah.  The day doesn't even compare to after school so I won't even spend time writing about it.  The excitement started right after eighth period.    Dan V, Raz, and Chris got to experience my driving after school, but not before I made a stupid mistake and pulled out right in front of... you ready for this? Paloma and her mother. Her mom lays on the horn and Paloma yells something out the window.  I couldn't her over our laughter but I'm sure I'll hear about it Monday.  Yes it was all my fault, sorry Paloma.  After taking Dan home, and on the way back into town the biggest bumble bee I have ever seen flies into Raz's window and hits mine.  I'm going 45mph trying to keep the car on the road while this bee is freaking out somewhere down where my legs were.  I hate bees. After maintaining total composure... HA, I pulled over and we let the bee back into its environment.  5 seconds later the bee was outsmarted by the sweet scented bug-catcher bag by the side of the road and is now probably dead.  Serves it right for impairing my driving!!  After that exciting incident we headed to Chris' house and decided to get some guys together and go play basketball down at the Stonebridge pool/park.  We got Noah, and Pat P to join us so we went and played some crazy basketball, later deciding to switch to sand volleyball.    This is where my lack of excellent narrative skills might take away from the ensuing shakedown.  After driving to Jesse's to get a volleyball, only to come back with a soccer ball, and having my car blasted with sand by Pat and Noah, an intimidating group of about 10 fifth graders began to gather up by the pavilion.  About halfway through the following incident Chris realized just how much this resembled the cast of Lord of the Flies, so I will begin by substituing the kid's actual names (which I don't even know), with their respective character in the Lord of the Flies.    The whole thing began with a simple attack on our authority.  A chubby boy with badly bleached hair, lovingly renamed Piggy, snobbily asked "How can you play volleyball with a soccer ball??"  The rest of the boys then proceeded to rally behind this youngster in expressing how dumb we must be and how since they outnumber us, they could take us.  At this point you don't even understand how confused we were.  "Jack", a kid with a small head and a hawk-like expression, also the 'ring leader' of the "mini-pimps", was intent on making us aware that he could hit us with his tennis ball.   ALright, side note. The thing that makes this so uncool is that we didn't feel right retaliating.  I think there's something about a five year age difference that qualifies for child abuse, so there are no funny comments about us ramming their heads into the pavement; it was pretty much a one sided battle.  Anyways so Jack and "Roger" ended up coming over to chris and took his shoes which he had taken off to play sand volleyball.  They quickly filled them up with sand and confiscated his socks.  Simon gracefully returned Chris' shoe and now is probably being torn apart by his gang for such traitorous acts. Chris' other shoe was taken by Jack and thrown up into a tree, but then "Ralph" stayed behind and showed me where it was so I could hit it down with the soccer ball.  I faced a simliar problem.  When I wasn't looking Roger took my FootWarmer moccasins that I like to drive in and made it the base of a sand pyramid.  Inside of the shoe is fleece so there is now sand imbedded in my driving shoes. Why didn't we bring our paintball guns???!  Razvan didn't get his shoes filled with sand... Jack hit him in the balls from 3 feet away with a tennis ball.  Jack ran. Razvan hit the ground.  I thought that he was going to turn into some super being and rip their heads off, but he amazingly kept his cool.   This was all compounded with their sand throwing and gangster backtalk.  It was disgusting.  We finally decided to just get in the car and go home after Noah and Pat P had to leave.  Well it was one of the most interesting thing thats happened in a while, and a perfect example of how kids are filthy savages, mwahahaha, some much more than others, and also how younger kids are growing up way too fast.  I wouldn't have known half the things they did when I was in fifth grade. I didn't know what gay meant, i didnt know all of these swearwords, these savages knew them all. And I didnt have any bling bling :(. Oh well, hopefully more interesting days will come this weekend, but its been quite a Friday. 5 full days of school left, yearbooks wednesday.  Peace  Chad

      Yesterday I didn’t have time to post because I didn’t get around to getting on the computer until it was too late to really write something.    Yesterday was a decent day but didn’t start out so hot.  First period we started softball in gym which wasn’t too bad.  It’s not as bad as having ultimate Frisbee where you’re running the whole time and getting really sweaty.  Everything was going fine until Raz’s throwing skills had to shine through while trying to throw me out at third and the ball connected with the back of my head.  Other than that the day went fine.  Model UN ran pretty smoothly During 7th and 8th period I was excused to attend a sound certification training on the auditorium’s sound system.  I learned a couple new things but it was sort of boring and lasted all the way until 5:00.  After that I went straight home and took a nap before driving to the High School for the end of the year jazz performance.  We did fine and Jazz I was once again a treat to watch.  	Today was also a great day. I figured out today that light backpacks make me a nicer person.  I left 80% of my stuff at home today and I was in heaven; I didn’t realize how much I had been carrying until I significantly lightened it.  Today we got to use a notecard on the test AND she made it a partner test!! My partner and I got really confused on the last page but it was excellent being able to work in pairs on the last test of the year. I just got home from the Special Olympics opening ceremony.  It was pretty cool except for having to wear an XL T shirt – that is one thing that really bothers me: I hate wearing shirts that are too big. Hanging out with Katie, Steph, Kyle, and John sent the maturity out the window so we had a little too much fun.  Afterwards one of the contestants come up to Kaitlin – “And this one time,at band camp!!”  You gotta give him credit for piecing together the movie, the instrument, and the hair color, but I doubt Ms. Pope will ever be attending the Special Olympics again.    I found out today from Mr. Butler that because it’s the end of the year, I am allowed to come and park at school without a parking permit.  If I get a ticket I can take it to him and he said he’d deal with it, what a cool dude.    Mom went to Goodwill today and bought a Longaberger basket priced at $5. At the counter the clerk said that she hit the jackpot because avid basket collectors sometimes pay upwards of $100 for them. Can you say EBAY?  They had a sign up that they were hiring so mom brought home an application and I turned it in earlier this evening.  The manager had just left so the lady said that I would probably be getting a phone call. Wouldn’t that be a convenient location.  6 more days of regular classes!  I’m lookin forward to some rockin end of the year bashes.  I want my freaking yearbook! latest update, from my 8th pd. teacher's email, says June 9, homeroom... More tomorrow –   Peace  Chad

      Just the fact that today was Tuesday made my day a little brighter. It dispelled the Monday curse and reminded me that I only have a 4 day week of school.  I was originally stressed because I missed Friday and on many occasions it takes me atleast 2 days to get caught up, but that stress died away once I realized that my world history teacher, my math teacher, and my spanish teacher were also not at school and therefore couldn't lecture or give necessary notes.    As always, Biology was the most exciting period of the day.  Today we watched a video on Biodiversity so Shannon, Cliff, Becky, and I routinely hung out on the back wall ledge.  If I had one of the pieces of art to scan I would post it, but sadly I didn't come away with any of today's artwork.  Shannon was intrigued by the kangaroo rats on the video so she decided to transform Cliff into a kangaroo rat selling subs at Subway.  I'm not yet sure what birthed the idea into her mind, but today Shannon came up with what is now my word of the day. Fungina. Sexually related? I think not. Perv.  Lord of the Flies finally got interesting! *chomp chomp* *scratch sratch* BYE BYE SIMON!!    Model UN starts tomorrow and I'm a little nervous.  I think I'll know what to say going into it, but once I stand up I think there's a good chance the Delegation of Kenya will say something stupid.   Right after school I went to see about a parking permit for the last week of school after seniors leave because I'm cool like that and the lady rudely interrupted me saying that I needed to see Mr. Butler. She pointed out his office but I found out that he wasn't there, which the lady I'm sure already knew even before interrupted me.  Argh maybe tomorrow. Stupid office ladies.   After school there was a Thespian meeting and then since I didn't have a ride I decided to go chill out at Weis for bit.  I got some food, did a little Spanglish, and then went to the Autoport to apply for their position advertised in the paper. 10 minutes after I walk in the lady says "tell Mary to take the ad out of the newspaper". Could that mean I got the job already? NOPE. It means I reminded them that they didn't need the ad anymore. GAH. - the lady said she still would like to see my application in case one of the college kids doesn't work out. I also put one in at Weis just in case - Who knows.  I'll probably add something later, but for now happy June.  Peace   Chad

      Well today wasn't very productive.  I really didn't read my book, so now I'm going to write an analysis of a book that I didn't even finish the first chapter of...It must be the end of the school year.  I really hope Motter doesn't stumble upon this site because she'll saw my balls off with a butter knife or something, we'll see how it goes.  This evening consisted of trying not to fall asleep to the lulling sound of the rain and talking to friends.  My room is way too hot and opening the windows isn't helping argh! I'm trying to not think of finals as much as I can.  A couple teachers this year have pulled the whole "I'm not going to leave any time for review, you can do that on your own"  Instead I hear... " Keep your grades up as much as you can because you're going to screw yourself with the finals"  YEEHAW RoCk On! I hope everyone had an amazing memorial day despite the weather.  I hear we get yearbooks tomorrow. That makes me excited.  I can taste summer - The only thing I still need is a job.  I'm applying at the Autoport tomorrow, that would be exciting.  Alright well I need to read some Lord of the Flies sparknotes and hit the pillow. Holla back Motter!  Peace  Chad

      I ran out of time writing this last night so the date says Sunday. I saved it as a draft so those of you how are very observant might have been curious as to why this post runs until Monday - though I can see into the future, I did not exercise those powers here.  This weekend has been quite the adventure, considering I pretty much had a four day weekend. Friday was consumed with an all day elementary jazz tour, in which we entertained four different schools.  The last school, Ferguson, was by far the most enjoyable of the four, partly because it was the end of the day and the kids were laughing and clapping along, but also due to the fact that I went to Ferguson. WOOT.    The Jazz tour led straight into Cabaret rehearsal.  This was the first time that Kaitlin and I got to work the sound board in preparation for the show on Saturday, but surprisingly the entire dress -rehearsal ran smoothly with next to no mic problems. Last year and earlier this year sound wasn't the most enjoyable thing in the world.  If you made one mistake ryan or whoever would give you a hard time and it was a sucky environment. Cabaret was the laid-back smaller group that I needed, and the addition of Kaitlin made it even better.  After rehearsal I got the opportunity to drive Becky home, and I hope I gained her trust.  I'd rather not be known as the crazy driver that gets people killed.    Onto day 3 and the most hectic of the bunch.  I wish my parents would be more lenient in letting me drive me friends around.  Because of this lunch plans with Kelsey fell through, but I atleast got the opportunity to drive around town and pick up some stuff. I got a cassette adapter to play some rawkin CDs in my car with my cd player, only to find out that my speakers aren't the sexiest things in the world. Oh but that will change...once I get another job.  Anyways I also drove to Holiday Hair and got my hair cut by myself - Im giddy with this new independence - and I don't think they screwed it up too badly.    Later that afternoon I was able to share my driving with yet another friend (it wouldnt have happened if it weren't totally necessary, but it still ticks me off that I wasn't able to go out to lunch).  I drove out to get Dan V and we got to march in the Boalsburg Parade in our sexy marching band uniforms! Oh man did that ever ROCK.  There's really not much to say there except that the Beaver 103 mascot is the stupidest thing I've ever seen and it has probably made numerous little children pee their pants.  Welllll after the parade we filled the busses and went back to State High but got there at about 6:30!! Call for Cabaret was 6! FREAKIN A.  I threw my stuff in the car and probably ruined Dan's trust in my driving. By the time i got him home I was already almost an hour late for Cabaret.  Since my house was on the way back to State High I dropped off my marching band uniform, got the shortest shower of my life because I was unpleasant after marching in hot weather in a uniform, and put on dark clothing for Cabaret.  When I finally got back to the school Kaitlin was in a panic - hehe SORRY - I was only ohh an hour and 15 minutes late , but who's counting?  The show went really well. I was impressed.  I thought it was going to be an almost perfect sound show until I had to go and fudge it up with a phone ringing in Hell but we're not going into that.  The show ran late and by the time it ended there was no chance of my getting home by 11.  Instead of making my parents wake up my sister and drive out to pick me up, which they expressed would really be an inconvenience, I decided to drive uber-carefully and get home a.s.a.p. That didn't go over too well.  Because I could have gotten caught and blah blah blah I can't drive until Tuesday which I guess really isn't that bad.  Finally, I watched an SNL rerun, the one with Ben Affleck hosting, which just so happened to be my favorite one of the season.  Sunday was a very relaxing day.  Chris invited me to his old neighbor's annual picnic/get together and it was pretty fun.  Chris and I took on his brother Alex and his girlfriend in badmitton.  I also proceeded in kicking Chris' sorry anus in lawn darts and volleyball but I don't think he minded too much. Mwahahahaha. I stayed at the picnic for two hours or so and then tried to convince my parents to let me go to the Dusk-to-Dawn drive in thing.  They weren't thrilled about a bunch of unsupervised 16 year olds staying up all night and the fact that two of the 5 movies were R, so instead, Dan V, Chris and I went to The Day after Tomorrow.    The movie was awesome partly because the special effects kicked butt, but also because the audience was so immature, maybe including us, and made kissing noises at the corny first kiss and tried predicting lines after dramatic pauses in the action. That was all followed by unnecessary screaming while the flesh-hungry wolves were enjoying their screen time.. well it was fun, maybe you just had to be there.  Before going home we checked out the movie posters that Cinema 5 were selling. This gave us the joyous chance to have a conversation with a girl on a volleyball team from Virginia and her mom.  It was pretty much a routine conversation until the mom asked us why the stores closed so early.  This is when we began to think that perhaps she may have downed a few beers because the next thing she said just doesn't come out of a mother's mouth while her daughter is standing right there.  "The shops close so early around here, we were going to go to Abercrombie and buy her some sleazy skirts. She likes to wear those things"  Well she seemed nice and really didnt care about what her mom said. Maybe State College is just different.  I left with 3 new posters to clothe my walls: the Ladykillers, Master and Commander and........ Mean Girls. You know it.   I'm starting to think that I should read this as my weekend story to Mr Lyke.  It might actually be worse than one of Cliff's. haha just kidding cliff.  After the movie I tried getting back to my memoir for English, but that just wasn't going to happen. I have 200 some pages to read in one day and the book sucks as is.   Before going to bed James enlightened me on the good news.  James and Krysta, I wish you the best.  Monday began lazily as the last day of this wonderful vacation.  Just like last year the rain let loose, but this time we decided not to go to downtown Boalsburg.  I haven't really done anything today besides eat some stuff, watch some TV, and read some of this stupid stupid book.   I promise no future posts will be this long.  I should probably waste the next few hours of this groggy day and get back to this book.  Peace  Chad

      Whoopsies, been a tid bit lazy lately. I am just in a state of constant happiness about summer. It's amazing but I am not stressed at all about finals.  I love the yearbooks this year, it really makes up for not getting one last year.  It makes me mad that I didn't make some good friends until the end of the year or the last half of the year. So much valuable time wasted because of shyness.  I glanced through my dad's old highschool yearbook the other day and some of the blurbs people wrote him are really funny and must bring back awesome memories.  I hope mine does the same.   The last day of regular school is tomorrow and the threat of finals I think has made us forget that tomorrow is the last day we're going to see everyone we regularly see.  :(  Ohhh but summer is way too close.  Today after school Chris, Raz and I went and played basketball outside in the pouring down rain and it was pretty fun. wet, but fun. We went barefoot and I think im getting blisters but it was worth it.      So far Pu and James G. and I are going to Mean Girls on Saturday night.. you know you want to come!   Cheers to yearbooks and friday  Peace    Chad

      On 8th June 2004 a transit of Venus will be observed from Earth when Venus comes directly between the Sun and our planet and it will be seen to move across the bright solar disk. The previous transit of Venus occurred on December 6, 1882 - one of merely five events of its kind ever watched by mankind.    ARGH I missed it!!! I'll add a pic stolen from some website to show what it would have looked like.  After school today Dan, Brandon, Meg, Angela and I went to Big Eats to study for the Wade final. From what we hear the final is a joke, just an exact combination of all 3 marking period tests, so I don't think we're quite as worried as we were a couple days ago.  Maybe Wade took pity on those who took the final early, but she better NOT HAVE!  It was hilarious.  The cook made a deal with us that whoever got the highest score on the final gets a free meal.  ITS SO ON! There goes the teamwork we planned on..  We'll be meeting tomorrow but I have my doubts on how productive it will be. It will no doubt be a lot of fun though.  Argh the heat in my room has put me in a bad mood.  The air conditioner doesnt reach my room, I don't have a fan, and even when I open my windows it does nothing.  I need some ice cream. Pity party for chad.  The only hw I have left is studying for the last Bio quiz, and I want to get to bed early....trying not to get distracted by NBA game 2...   congrats seniors-yearbooks tomorrow  Peace  Chad

      This morning I had to perform the fastest get-ready-for-the-day routine of the year.  Something malfunctioned with my alarm clock and I was woken up by Becky's phonecall making sure I was on my way to pick her up for school.   I "lunged" out of bed, "dashed" to the shower, "sped" through my daily cleansing, and "sprinted" to my car. Yeah things went by pretty fast.   Well it all turned out fine; I got to Becky's house only 5 or 6 minutes after I said I would be there and it was no trouble finding a place to park.  We'll see what magic happens tomorrow morning.    In all of my classes except for English we are done, well except for one last Bio quiz.  Mrs. Motter has the genius idea of having us write an essay in class for the next two days instead of reviewing.  S-S-S-STUPID!  Bio was once again entertaining today.  The boring movie, rather Cliff's unusual satisfaction with his PB&J sandwich prompted more creative artwork.  Yeah Cliff we know how you like that peanut butter. OH YEAH!   After school I went to Foxdale to apply for the job opening but everywhere I went they redirected me to where I might be able to pick up a form.  I swear its a game they like to play and I was just their pawn today.  Those mischevious retirees, you just wait until I'm serving your food, then we'll see who's the pawn!!! MWAHAHAHAHA.  Ahem, anyhoo no need to worry, old people rock.   I have no idea why I'm writing tonight I am so tired.  I really shouldn't be because I just got up from an accidental 3 hour nap after school.  Highway Pizza for jazz band must have really worn me out or something.  The Warped Tour 2004 compilation comes out tomorrow, w00t.  Peace  Chad

      I'm all signed up for Camp Crosstraining now, it sure took me long enough to turn in the registration form.    After Sunday school I washed my car and shop vac-ed the sand and crap out of the seats and floor mats.  It looks a lot cleaner now, but I'm sure it won't take too long to dirty back up again.    Once again today we got a group of friends together and played basketball and beach volleyball at Stonebridge park, though today we didn't get ambushed by 5th graders.  They did make an appearance, but didn't come very close to us.    I have a feeling we will all be getting together at that park a lot this summer, and with all that basketball we should be ready for an IMBA debut, lol.  It'll be fun. Still need a name though..  I just saw Hugh Jackman shaking his arse in tight gold pants and pelvic thrusting on the Tony Awards..Yeah I can never watch X-Men again.  kelkey119: how's your night been? chadicus7: just fine, ive just been watching television and just ran to the bathroom to throw up when i saw wolverine pumping his pelvis on the tony awards kelkey119: i love hugh jackman! chadicus7: yeah NOW you do   I should work on more hw because I keep putting it off.
