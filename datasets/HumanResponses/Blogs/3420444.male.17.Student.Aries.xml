       jus now watch the 9 o clock drama on channel 55 called ming qing jia zu...damn nice n interesting..still prefer hk dramas to singapore ones..in today's episode..it is about the female protagonist(correct spelling not ah?i trying to improve me ang moh) being hypnotised and the murderer use this method to make her think that she is the actual killer..so cool and sounds freaky cause u will never know one day whether u get hypnotise or not by any stranger n u may get into deep shit like the nu zhu jiao..talking about hypnotise..i jus remembered a weird dream i had last night..i dreamt i went into NS BMT and my platoon consists of all the people i know!!some friends from pri sch like louis and a few faces which i forgot my name,dhs classmates like khai yuen yong yang kuang ting and jc people like soon kiat n dao wei...so qiao one..but of coz this will not happen in real life one la..wonder what does it mean..i heard dreams can interpret something in real life..hmm...chim sia..
