      Just got back from Target where I brought a lot of stuff for my service trip next week.  I got tons of good snacks and a bunch of other stuff - I think I'm going to be eating better there than I do at home.   Visited LaSalle today.  The campus was pretty nice, but I didn't like it as much as I liked Temple.  My parents want me to visit St. Joseph's, but they don't have a communications program, so I'm not too sure.

      I almost forgot - my dad left for a business trip to Japan yesterday.&nbsp; It's a fourteen hour long flight!&nbsp; I don't think I could ever take that... I could only sleep for like 12 hours straight, and then I couldn't take the two remaining hours.&nbsp; Okay, maybe if the in-flight movie was  Dumb & Dumber  or something like that.  I almost can't stand that movie anymore because they ruined it by making a sequel.&nbsp; You ever notice that sequels either really really suck or are really really awesome?&nbsp;  Spider-man 2  was even better than the first one, and than you have suck-fests like  Rocky 5 .&nbsp; Oh well, what can you do?

      I worked at Panera all day today (or, seeing as it's now after midnight, yesterday) from 10:00AM-6:00PM.&nbsp; At first I was on dining room, but then Sam the manager said that I could get trained pouring soups.&nbsp; It wasn't too bad, but when it got slow it felt like the day would go on forever.  I went over to my mom's place for dinner - chicken, steak, and rice - and afterwards I jumped on the trampoline.&nbsp; Me and my sister were playing with this huge ball and I kicked it and it hit her arm and it must have snapped it back in a weird direction because she started crying because it hurt really bad.&nbsp; At first, I thought that she broke it, but she seems to be doing much better now.&nbsp;   Well I'm working from 2:30-10:00... so at least I'll get to sleep in.&nbsp; I can't wait until Tuesday - I'm going down to the Art Museum in Philadelphia because John Kerry is coming by for a rally.&nbsp; It's one of his last stops before he flys up to Boston to accept the nomination in Boston on Thursday.&nbsp; I'll make sure that I take a lot of pictures and post the best ones here.&nbsp; I already have a picture of me and Teresa Heinz-Kerry at a John Kerry rally at the Philadelphia Convention Center.&nbsp; It would be awesome to get a picture with Kerry, but&nbsp;I have a feeling that this event is going to be huge with a lot of people and media, so I doubt that I'll get the chance.  Well, I'm tired as could be so I think I'll hit the hay now.&nbsp; Comedy Central is running reruns of the Chappelle Show - which is simply the funniest show on television - so maybe I'll check that out until I fall asleep.&nbsp; I crack up everytime I watch the famous "Rick James" sketch, but so many people quote it all the time that it's not funny.&nbsp; New rule - if you're not Dave Chappelle, you can't impersonate Rick James.

      Just got back from the car wash soaking wet.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun, and we made over three hundred dollars!&nbsp; Not too bad if you ask me.&nbsp; It's gonna go towards trips and stuff for the rest of the year.  I'm working at Panera from 4:30-10:00 tonight.&nbsp; Saturday nights usually aren't that busy, so it shouldn't be that bad.&nbsp; I could use the money.  I just got a nice licence plate frame for my car that has flames shooting out of it at Pep Boys.&nbsp; Now all I need to get is a nice subwoffer and my car will be all set.  Alright, I really should go and get changed now.&nbsp; Later.

      Yesterday was payday, which was great because I really needed the money to pay off my dad the money I owe him on my car this month.&nbsp; I worked sixty-five hours!  Today is the WINGS carwash, and I think that it will be a lot of fun.&nbsp; My car needs to get washed anyway, so it'll be good.

I ordered these "Bush Cards" off the internet that have little known facts about the administration (like Karl Rove's nickname is 'Turd Blossom') and I'm going to break them out tonight.&nbsp;

      We had the longest Panera meeting tonight that all of the associates had to attend.&nbsp; It sucked because all that anyone would talk about is how we needed to do a better job so that the store could make more money.&nbsp; It was really pointless.   The good news was that we are creating a softball team.&nbsp; Tomorrow the manager is going to call up the manager of the Moorestown Panera and set up a date for us to play them.   I worked a lot this week, and I can't wait to get my paycheck on Friday.&nbsp; It will be really cool to actually have some money.

        urlLink         In keeping with the tradition of generations of Prep alumni, almost half of the senior class skipped school or left class early on Thursday, April 22 to attend the Philadelphia Phillies "Businessman's Special" at the new Citizen's Bank Park.  According to the Dean of Students Office, 103 seniors were absent and 18 left early that day.  In all, these 121 students represented 48.4 percent of the senior class. 	Seniors were only allowed to leave school if they had written permission from their parents, or if a parent called the Deans Office.  Seniors who missed the entire school day had to have their parents call the school, or their absence would be recorded as unexcused. 	In the 1998-99 school year, however, seniors from the Prep and students from Monsignor Bonner High School got into a fight that drew national attention to the school - including jokes from Howard Stern and David Letterman.  At this year's game it was the players, and not the fans, that got into a fight. &nbsp; urlLink

       The middle states committee that met in March lectured all of the faculty about mistrust.  They said that they got the sense that the faculty did not trust the administration because of the firings, etc.  When students were not in school on May 17th, the teachers were having a faculty meeting and discussing how they could rebuild trust at school.

       This is something I've been wanting to publish somewhere for a long time.  Here it goes.  After counseling students at the Prep for more than a decade, Intervention Specialist Cheryl Thomas was told on Tuesday, April 6 that she would have to leave the building.  Prep Registrar Marie Kettinger and Counseling Department Chair Doctor John Berna informed her that she had to pack up her items.  Security Guard Bob Furth watched Thomas as she gathered her things and left the building during fourth and fifth period that day. Thomas had set up a meeting with Coury on Wednesday, March 10 to discuss her future at the Prep.  On that Saturday, Coury told Thomas via e-mail that her contract would not be renewed for the following year. According to a series of e-mails between Coury and Thomas, the reason that she would not receive a contract was because President Rev. Bruce Bidinger, S.J. had decided to eliminate the Intervention Program.   The e-mail also said that the manner in which the school delivers guidance and counseling services to students is under review.  Coury encouraged Thomas to meet with Berna to “explore alternate ways for delivering counseling services to our students.” The news of the dismissal came after Thomas was notified that she was not allowed to appeal Bidinger’s decision to the Professional Standards Committee.  Because the Intervention department was being eliminated, Thomas was told that her case would not be allowed to be heard before the board. Before she learned that she was fired in early April, Thomas stressed that the reason she was told that her contract was not being renewed was because her position was being eliminated, and she was very surprised at the decision. “The Student Services Committee of Middle States personally commended me for the way in which I ran the program,” said Thomas.  “They said they would make that a part of their report.”  The Middle States Report is due out in mid-April. Thomas has been at the Prep since 1991, when she worked for an outside service with Prep students two days a week.  In 1998, Former Prep President Rev. Father David Sauter, S.J. offered Thomas a full-time position.  Eliminating Thomas’ position allows the administration to step around a clause in the Administrative and Professional Policies of the Prep that says that teachers who have taught for three or more years “cannot be terminated without a formal period of probation, save for moral turpitude.”  If the school had wanted to put Thomas on probation, they would have had to notify her by January 15. The Policies indicate that this probation period should last until the end of the second semester, and extended to the first semester of the next year if necessary.   Although she has been at the Prep for over five years, Thomas is not considered a tenured member of the faculty because she does not yet have a Master’s degree in her field of study.  Thomas is due to receive her Master’s degree in May.  If she had received her diploma, the school would have to place her on probation for three semesters before terminating her contract. Bidinger said that eliminating the Intervention program is a necessary step this year in order to allow him to hire another counselor who can give the senior class the help they need. “We have an entire class of 250 students who are not getting the attention that they deserve,” said Bidinger.  “We are simply reallocating the resources from a department that only helps a small number of students.  With the stresses of the college application process, seniors more help than students in the Intervention office.  The issues for us are the best use of our faculty.” Bidinger also said when the needs of students change, the school needs to make changes.  He wanted to be able to extend the Prep’s counseling services of the Prep to the seniors while not expanding the budget.  He added that he had asked the Guidance Department to develop a plan for keeping the Intervention Office and reaching out to the senior class, but was not satisfied with the result.  At the time of the interview in late March, Bidinger said that Thomas was welcome to apply for the new counseling position. After the meeting was finished, however, Bidinger said that he would not allow any article to print in the student newspaper The Hawklet that could damage the Prep’s reputation. Students involved with the Intervention program expressed concern that the administration does not know all of the programs and services that the Intervention office offers, including personal and confidential counseling open to all students, family sessions to resolve crises, and alcohol and drug educational programs. The office also offers support groups for students which run once a cycle on drug and alcohol intervention and prevention programs, mental health issues and aftercare, early intervention for “high risk” students (a group which includes homosexual students and those with undiagnosed mental health issues), stress management, and a group for students who have gone through divorce, trauma and other issues. For some of these troubled Prep students, Thomas is available via her pager 24 hours every day. “I think that the elimination of the Intervention office is a strong statement against Cura Personallis,” said Dan DiPasquale, who is a junior and a STEP leader in the SADD program that Thomas leads.  “It’s a pervasive problem that has yet to be solved, and these are not the only issues that the Intervention program addresses.” Another student commented that he was not sure if the administration knows all of the problems the Intervention Office deals with. “There are a lot of people who do not really know all of what Ms. Thomas does,” said junior Victor Bethea. In addition to the daily problems Thomas dealt with in the office, she also coordinates the Prep’s Special Programs Days and presents at Drug and Alcohol information nights for students.  Thomas also created the STEP program and helped to form the Prep drug and alcohol task force which explores various ways to deal with the Prep’s drug and alcohol problems. Prep English teacher James O’Brien, who had served on Thomas’ Student Services committee for all but two years since the early 80’s, said that before the Intervention program, the faculty did not have a good view of the substance abuse problems. “When we did not have an intervention staff, we used someone who visited the school once a week,” said O’Brien.  “The current system has worked much better because we have someone who is constantly in touch with the students, because the issues that the office deals with are sensitive and spontaneous.” “I never realized how essential this program is for the students until I found out that it might end,” said Thomas.  “I love this job, I love what I do everyday here.  As stressful as it is, I realize how important the program is, and I do not want to see the school lose it.” Bidinger said that he believes that the other counselors at the Prep are highly trained and would be able to handle the problems that the Intervention Office has typically dealt with.  As of press time, he was not sure if the group sessions would continue, or who would moderate the drug education programs that Thomas has led. When parents of Prep juniors came to school on April 1 for a presentation by a Philadelphia Policewoman on the dangers of drugs and alcohol, Thomas explained the situation to them and asked them to sign a petition stating that they wanted the Intervention program to stay.  114 parents of juniors signed the petition, which Bidinger was made aware of once he had returned from his Kairos retreat on Monday.  Thomas had said the week before she left that she has contacted a lawyer and was planning legal action against the school if they did not renew her contract.   The student newspaper The Hawklet was told by their moderator Eileen Day that she had been told not to print any articles containing Thomas’ name or mentioning the Intervention office.  This was the second case direct censorship that the newspaper dealt with this year.  The first article that was censored addressed the complaint of the Middle States Committee who visited the school in March that there was a lack of trust between the faculty and the administration. Thomas was not allowed to be reached for comment while she was packing up her belongings.  E-mails sent to Thomas were not returned as of press time, likely because her Prep e-mail address had been shut down. Thomas is officially on administrative leave for the remainder of this year.
