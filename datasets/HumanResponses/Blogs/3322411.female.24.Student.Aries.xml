      Even though it's old, the whole Terri Schiavo case still interests me greatly. I can understand why her parents would want to keep her alive. After all, it is their daughter; they brought her into this world and parents never want to see their children die before they do. However, why would you let one of your loved ones suffer in a vegetative state? Her husband has been trying to end her life by having her tubes removed. The whole idea that the Governor intervened struck a nerve with me. It was not in his place to decide a person's life. Leave that to the family to decide. Her husband has been trying to move on with his life, but there are setbacks. She apparently told her husband before her accident that she would never want to live a life as a vegetable, and I could understand that. I personally would not want to continue living if I or a family member was brain dead and could no longer communicate. The person is physically there, but what is the point of having them around if they cannot serve any other purpose? It is extremely expensive to keep a person living off artifical means as well as keeping an individual like Terri alive. I have already mentioned to friends and family that I wouldn't want to leave off artificial means or allow me to live my life as a vegetable.

      As with any job, all employees and employers must uphold the highest ethical and moral responsibilites. As a former leasing agent, I too had to deal with my fair share of ethical responsibilities.  It definitely is not in my nature to try to sell a false product by lying to prospects, their friends, and their families.  It was my responsibilty to show prospects our model apartment and our amenities. I was always asked whether or not certain items came with the apartment and how safe our property was. I answered their questions to the best of my abilities, and if I didn't have an answer for them, I told them I would be more than happy to get back to them on it. I have been around other leasing agents who have blatantly lied just to get the prospect to sign at my complex or one of our sister properties. When I have a prospect willing to sign their lease with us, the majority of the students do not read the leases thoroughly. Since I noticed this trend, I basically hit all the most important details in the lease so they wouldn't be surprised about anything when they actually move in. Some of the prospects complained that our price was out of their range, but I let it be known to them that if they signed at a conventional apartment, they would probably wind up paying more because they will have to pay extra for electricity, water, cable, internet service, etc. Our facilities includes all of those, plus much more. If I didn't get them to sign with us, at least I knew I gave it my best and I could sleep better at night knowing that I did my job in an ethical manner.  On a brighter note, I saw Shrek 2 on its opening night. My boyfriend and I thought it was better than the first one and we wouldn't mind seeing it again. Puss in Boots was definitely one of the best characters (Donkey wins hands down)!! I can relate to Puss because I know how to make people believe that I'm innocent.....and Puss is tiny just like me!! :-)

      This past weekend, I saw an interesting program on MSNBC that dealt with a mother who was accused of killing her adopted son. It was fascinating because of the defense that she used--she said that the child's death, who was only 2 1/2 years old, inflicted injuries to himself that resulted in his death.  Apparently it was due to a syndrome called Reactive Detachment Disorder. After seeing the photographs by the prosecution, I don't see how any 2 1/2 year old can inflict such harsh injuries to him or herself. These injuries included excessive bruising to the entire body, red and swollen genitals, and spoon and spatula marks on the child. The paramedics were called to their house at 4 am because the child was choking on his vomit. Instead of calling 911 first, the mother called her mother and told her she had to come immediately. Then when she finally called 911, she was extremely calm. I mean, come on, if your child is choking, how can any mother not be hysterical?  The mother claimed that around other people, including the father, the child would be extremely jovial. However, when she was alone with him, he often attacked her and she would have to fight him off. I find it hard to believe that any 2 1/2 year old child can be that dangerous. She said there were numerous occasions when he supposedly hurt himself, but yet she never took him to see a physician. Her reasoning behind that was after he finished hurting himself, for instance--hitting his head against a pew, he just got up and acted normal like nothing had happened. She should have taken him to the hospital regardless just to make sure nothing was wrong. She even went to therapy sessions with him and he didn't show any outward signs of aggression. A psychologist noted that when the little boy started kissing all over the mother's face, she didn't show any emotion or reaction; she just sat their stone-faced.  A parent's ultimate responsibility is looking out for the well-being of their child(children). I know if I noticed anything wrong with my child, I would seek attention. She did not take the stand in her defense to explain what really happened. What does she have to hide if she claims he the injuries were self-inflicted? Other evidence against her was she never went to the hospital to say good-bye to her son and she immediately sought legal counsel. I know for a fact that I would be by my son or daughter's bedside regardless of the fact of what people may think. At one point, she even wanted to give him up for adoption because he was too much trouble for her. The father stated that if you have problems with your own child, you cannot just give them up. She didn't really make a strong case for me when she actually decided to grant the interview 2 1/2 years after her son died. Why did it take her so long to speak the apparent truth? She said she blocks out that night of his hurting himself because it hurts her so much. I would, too, if I knew that I had contributed to my child's death!!

      The Laci Peterson story has been in the news almost every day. I just wanted to pose my thoughts about Laci and Conner's Law that passed back in April by President Bush. It really breaks my heart to hear about stories like this, when two helpless victims were unjustifiably murdered. I was extremely content to hear that this law, which now makes it a crime to harm a fetus during an attack on a pregnant woman, was passed. However, I feel that this law should been enacted prior to the Peterson murder. I think that the murderer should be punished to the full extent of the law. What gives a person the right to murder either the unborn child, who has not caused any harm to anybody? Giving life to another human is one of the greatest miracles, and harm to a pregnant woman can cause her to lose the baby. An individual has to truly be deranged and heartless if they kill an unborn baby with no justification, while causing harm to his or her mother.  This bill, however, only applies during commission of federal crimes, such as terrorist attacks or drug-related shootings, and only when it is being committed against the pregnant mother. Not to knock this bill, but it isn't like we have terrorist attacks on a normal basis, and I do not believe that a pregnant woman would endanger the life of her baby by hanging out with drug addicts or dealers, whatever the case may be. Of course, these shootings can be accidental and the mother may be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Any individual that is responsible for inflicting harm, whether it is intentional or not, should be held accountable for their actions and definitely face the penalty for causing harm to the fetus. If a mother were to get into a car accident and her baby were to die, that person responsible should be held accountable for the baby's death. I'm glad that pregnant women will not be the only victim if something were to happen to their baby. As for Scott Peterson, I really hope he is found guilty.....We'll find out soon enough!!!

         Individuals have full control over what they do over the course of their life. Whether a person chooses to act in an irrational matter is in his or her hands, and they also have full control of what goes into their bodies.  Many individuals are fully aware of the consequences and effects of alcohol and drug abuse. What happens, though, when these individuals require a transplant? As it is, there is a shortage for organ transplantation, and we need to decide how to allocate these scarce resources. They chose to live a lifestyle that includes drugs and alcohol. I know if I were to donate my organs, I could not rest in peace knowing my organs went to a drug or alcohol user.     There are thousands of patients on the waiting lists to receive organ transplants. Many of these individuals die while waiting for that anticipated call letting them know they will be receiving their necessary organ. It is even worse when children have to wait for years to receive a transplant, cutting down the time they can be out having fun. I honestly wish we could prioritize who should be the first ones to receive transplants. I know that I would list drug and alcohol abusers at the very end. It is true that everyone is entitled to receive organ transplantation (even those individuals who are incarcerated). However, there should be some kind of limit as to whom receives these transplants. Why should an individual with a congenital defect be bypassed by someone who chose to abuse drugs or alcohol?     Sometimes those individuals who abuse drugs and alcohol are lucky. They have family members who are willing to donate their organ to save the life of a loved one. For instance, what if an alcoholic that received a new liver reverts back to his or her old ways and therefore will need another transplant? Alcohol and drug users have to understand that their lifestyle and behavior does not just affect them, it affects everyone around them. Individuals can promise they will not touch drugs or alcohol if they receive their transplant, but in some cases these individuals revert right back to their old ways. The medical profession increasingly will be faced with decisions about who should be allowed to donate organs and who should receive them. We should encourage people to come to the aid of a loved one who smokes or drinks or abuses other drugs, but not by endorsing irresponsible and dangerous behaviors.

        Medical errors are an inevitable part in medicine. These errors could include giving a patient the wrong medication or the wrong dosage, amputating the wrong limb, or even leaving instruments inside a patient's body during surgery. Patients who are given the wrong medication could suffer adverse effects, which could potentially lead to death. There have been numerous cases in which physicians have amputated the wrong limb or leaving instruments behind. It is imperative that all instruments are accounted for upon completion of the surgery. I know if I was a patient and my physician made an error, I would prefer to know about it up front instead of experiencing complications and finding out about it later on. If the physician acknowledges his or her negligence, I would be less likely to file against him or her and the hospital. It is a physician's obiligation to be truthful with his or her patients. Because of the everyday pressures, it could be understood that physicians will make errors due to an error in judgment or simply because they were not paying attention. In addition, physicians are prone to make errors due to lack of sleep or other distractions that might impair their judgment.  Physicians have an ethical obligation to uphold by disclosing their medical errors.      If I were a physician, I would disclose to my patient if I made an error. I am the type of individual where the insignificant things weigh on my mind. Since I would be dealing with a person's life, I would have a great sense of guilt if my error lead to serious complication or even death. Patients may experience a loss of trust in the medical system and perhaps the physician(s) responsible. However, it will be even more serious if they discover that something was hidden from them, whether or not it was a minor mistake. I understand that physicians do not want to look incompetent by admitting they made an error, but it is much better to justify what occurred. Should the physician withhold information, he or she will have to defend his or her reason(s) for withholding this vital information to the patient and his or her family.

      I'd like to make my comments in regards to an article that I read in the Sun Sentinel. It is about a surgery center, the Florida Center for Comestic Surgery, undergoing an investigation because they are allowing nonlicensed assistants to perform surgery. Can somebody please explain to me how anybody working in that office can even consider that as even being ethical? They are putting their patients in a dangerous situation by not having a physician operate on them. I would not want anybody operating on me that is not a board certified physician. Since 2000, there have been 14 malpractice suits and 2 patients have already died since their operation in November. After hearing this, who would want to go to a surgery center with all of this bad publicity? In addition, surgeons are leaving blank prescription slips that the employees could use to hand out medication. The assistant simply needs to write in the name of the patient and what drug they are supposed to receive. Since these prescriptions are not forged, any body could get a hold of these and have a field day writing out any kind of prescription. Are the surgeons really that busy that they have to sign these slips in advance? By doing this, the assistant could make an error in writing the prescription or they could be stolen. The wrong prescription could cause adverse effects to the patient and could possibly lead to death.   This is supposed to be one of the busiest plastic surgery practices. They claim that they hired additional physicians and nurses, but they were foreigners who didn't have a license to practice in Florida. You need to have competent staff in the operating room who knows what is occurring. Is the organization not aware that under Florida law you cannot have medical assistants performing any surgical duties? Did these physicians purchase their medical degree off the Internet? They must not have been paying too much attention in medical school if they have the audacity to endanger their patients' lives.  If you are interested in reading the article, you can find it at: http://www.sun-sentinel.com/features/health/sfl-prxcosmetics02jul02,0,4504024.story?coll=sfla-news-health

      I am writing in response to one of the cases in our books regarding gender discrimination in the workplace. I found it to be an interesting and insightful case in which individuals can learn from. I thought it was extremely unfortunate that the fellow was not offered a position because her protege, John, was physically attracted to her. After all of her accomplishments and outstanding work, she was denied a position simply because she was an attractive female. I know for a fact I'd be extremely peeved if I worked my rear off and I was denied a position because my employer was physically attracted to me. He made an assumption saying he thought the attraction was mutual and if she was given the position, it could potentially lead him into having an affair. You cannot make ethical and moral judgments or decisions based only on an assumption; it could wind up backfiring, as it did in this cases. I honestly believe that this would make any individual, whether male or female, feeling extremely humiliated. After all that effort and time she put in, was he simply giving her all those praises because he was attracted to her?  In any organizational setting, individuals are going to work with members of the opposite sex that they might find attractive, but that does not mean they are going to act on their impulses especially if they are happily married with or without children. The fellow might not even have had the slightest bit of interest in her mentor. She had every right to be upset with not getting that position, but claiming sexual harrassment might have been the wrong way to handle the situation. After she was offered another position, her male colleagues and executives limited the amount of time they spent with her. When an individual claims or threatens sexual harrassment charges, especially if they were working for the first time, it makes the situations with the opposite sex more tense. They fear that if they look at her the wrong way or say something out of the ordinary, she would file sexual harrassment charges against them. Who would want a reputation as the individual who makes sexual harrassment threats? It is often rare that males make sexual harrassment claims, but if was one in my organization that made a claim or threat, I would be extremely wary of him.    With John being the CEO of his organization, he should have made a better judgment call. In his eyes, he didn't see that he did anything wrong, but he brought humiliation and distrust to himself, his wife, and even the organization. The fellow had definitely warranted a position in that organization after her accomplishments and efforts she so diligently worked so hard for. I have a strong feeling that sexual harrassment occurs more often in work settings, but it is not reported for this very reason: the individual making the accusation does not want to have that reputation and have it follow him or her around everywhere he or she goes.
