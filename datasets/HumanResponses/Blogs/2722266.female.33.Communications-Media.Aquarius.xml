      Hey.  Please pray for Jaime, the sister of my friend and co-worker, Jeremy Slagle.  Jaime just had a baby -- the baby's fine, but she's having a lot of complications. She's slated for physical therapy and possibly surgery. And they're about to lose their health insurance.  Pray for Jaime's healing and that her husband, Jared, will find a job with health insurance.  John

      Okay--  Here we go. Last friday, despite the snow, we had a great meeting. We talked about the next 30 weeks' topics of discussion, divided roughly into three categories: 10 core beliefs, 10 core practices and 10 core virtures.   Here they are. Last week we talked about #1 on the core beliefs list. We're gonna do #2 (the church) this friday.  ----------------- 10 core beliefs ----------------- Authority of the Bible   I believe the Bible is the Word of God and has the right to command my belief and action.  2 Timothy 3:16–17, "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work."   Church   I believe the church is God's primary way to accomplish His purposes on earth today.  Ephesians 4:15–16, "Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From Him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work."   Compassion   I believe God calls all Christians to show compassion to those in need.  Psalm 82:3–4, "Defend the cause of the weak and fatherless; maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. Rescue the weak and needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."   Eternity   I believe there is a heaven and a hell and that Jesus Christ is returning to judge the earth and to establish His eternal kingdom.  John 14:1–4, "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going."   Humanity   I believe all people are loved by God and need Jesus Christ as their Savior.  John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."   Identity in Christ   I believe I am significant because of my position as a child of God.  John 1:12, "Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God."   Personal God   I believe God is involved in and cares about my daily life.  Psalm 121:1-2, "I lift up my eyes to the hills—where does my help come from? My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth."   Salvation by Grace   I believe a person comes into a right relationship with God by His grace, through faith in Jesus Christ.  Ephesians 2:8–9, "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast."   Stewardship   I believe that everything I am or own belongs to God.  1 Timothy 6:17–19, "Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life."   Trinity   I believe the God of the Bible is the only true God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  2 Corinthians 13:14, "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."   -------------------- 10 core practices --------------------  Bible Study   I study the Bible to know God, the truth and to find direction for my daily life.  Hebrews 4:12, "For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."   Biblical Community   I fellowship with other Christians to accomplish God's purposes in my life, others' lives, and in the world.  Acts 2:44–47, "All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as He had need. Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved."   Giving Away My Faith   I give away my faith to fulfill God's purposes.  Ephesians 6:19–20, "Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should."   Giving Away My Life   I give away my life to fulfill God’s purposes.  Romans 12:1, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship."   Giving Away My Time   I give away my time to fulfill God's purposes.  Colossians 3:17, "And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him."   Prayer   I pray to God to know Him, to lay my request before Him and to find direction for my daily life.  Psalm 66:16–20, "Come and listen, all you who fear God; let me tell you what He has done for me. I cried out to Him with my mouth; His praise was on my tongue. If I had cherished sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened; but God has surely listened and heard my voice in prayer. Praise be to God, who has not rejected my prayer or withheld His love from me!"   Spiritual Gifts   I know and use my spiritual gifts to accomplish God’s purposes  Romans 12:4,5, "Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts, according to the grace given us."   Worship   I worship God for who He is and what He has done for me.  Psalm 95:1–7, "Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation. Let us come before Him with thanksgiving and extol Him with music and song. For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods. In His hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him. The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land. Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; for He is our God and we are the people of His pasture, the flock under His care."   Single-mindedness   I focus on God and His priorities for my life.  Matthew 6:33, "But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well."   Giving Away My Money   I give away my money to fulfill God's purposes.  2 Corinthians 8:7, "But just as you excel in everything—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us—see that you also excel in this grace of giving."   ------------------ 10 core virtues ------------------  Gentleness  I am thoughtful, considerate and calm in dealing with others.  Philippians 4:5, "Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near."   Faithfulness   I am faithful to fulfill God's will for my life.  Proverbs 3:3–4, "Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man."   Hope   I can cope with the hardships of life and with death because of the hope I have in Jesus Christ.  Hebrews 6:17–20, "We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf."   Joy   I have inner contentment and purpose in spite of my circumstances.  John 15:11, "I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete."   Love   I unconditionally love others.  1 John 4:10–12, "This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and His love is made complete in us."   Peace   I am free from anxiety because things are right between God, myself and others.  Philippians 4:6–7, "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."   Self-Control   I have the power, through Christ, to control myself.  1 Thessalonians 5:6, "So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled."   Humility   I choose to esteem others above myself.  Philippians 2:3–4, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others."   Patience   I am patient with others.  Proverbs 14:29, "A patient man has great understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly."   Kindness/Goodness   I choose to do the right things in my relationships with others.  1 Thessalonians 5:15, "Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else."

      Hi all... Tracey Here..   I received this devotional yesterday,  (below)  and it made me reflect on the message at Emerge  (GREAT JOB JOHN!) .. and, also what Koinonia means... and, most importantly, community and the freedom that comes from just being real and open with people.. I think it is hard to be open with everyone.. if you think about it Christ had 12 disciples and only 3 that it seems like he was closer to (or at least the relationship is mentioned more in the Bible)..  So, to be free, and to be authentic... after reading this little devotional, and also reading John's blog.. I kind of think that just like we are to train ourselves to pray, walk in the Spirit, but to be real, authentic... we also have to train ourselves to be that..   And, I don't think it is something that will just happen if we attempt to be that way on a Friday night.. but, it is something that we must practice in our everyday lives..  Just like in Acts, they were devoted to fellowship...  [nice reference to Lord of the Rings, John.. ]  but, since I am on verge of a crazy schedule again with work/school.. I guess, I wonder how do I continue to have that fellowship and being devoted to others, when in reality, I know that i really must focus on my teens in my student teaching experience, and also working.. and, I will have very little free time?  Just a thought... God Bless!    RELATIONSHIP, NOT REGIMEN  "The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death" - (Romans 8:2).  Walking according to the Spirit is more a relationship than a  regimen. Think about prayer. Perhaps you learned to pray using the simple acrostic ACTS: adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication. But if you have been a Christian for a few years and your prayer life is no deeper than an acrostic, you've missed the point of prayer. Prayer is not a formula; it's the language of your relationship with God. Similarly, walking in the Spirit is essentially a relationship with the indwelling Spirit which defies quantification.  Even though Scripture doesn't give us a formula, it does help us see what the Spirit-filled walk is and what it is not. Helpful parameters are found in Galatians 5:16-18: "Walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law."  So how do you walk by the Spirit? If I answered by giving you a rigid formula, I would be putting you back under the law. The Spirit is not an "it"; the Holy Spirit is a "He"--a person. Walking by the Spirit is a relationship issue, not a legal issue or ritualistic exercise. It is a walk with God.

      I've been reading the latest edition of Relevant Magazine, which for those who don't know is about the best Christian magazine you can get your hands on...in my opinion of course! Anyways, there is an article written John Fischer, from which I would like to share a segment with all of you:  *Excerpt from 'Vital Christianity'...written by John Fischer*     "For a few years now I have been quoting from a 1995 article in Christianity Today by John D. Woodbridge, 'Culture War Casualties: How Warfare is Hurting the Work of the Church.'  The articles title refers to the supposed 'culture war' raging between the Curch and society.  That war may have waned some as Christian political action has fragmented, but the cultural isolationism it spawned among Christians is still alive and well.  Thus, I feel it bears another look.  'We may bemoan a moral decline in our country,' Woodbridge said.  'Our actual concern, if truth be known, is not to see vital Christianity flourish, but rather to secure a more orderly and less violent society in which to live out our comfortable and self-satisfied lives.'     This is a serious indictment if it is true.  It suggests that our attempts to influence culture come with a very selfish motive: to make the world a safer, more compatible place for our beliefs and lifestyles.  Much of this battle currently has reduced itself to skirmishes, such as the one in an Alabama courthouse concerning the posting of the Ten Commandments in public places, or the use of God rhetoric in the Pledge of Allegiance, or prayer at public and school events.  The question must be raised as to why Christians rally so vehemently around such causes.  Is it because we are genuinely concerned about the Kingdom of God on earth, or are we concerned about the preservation of 'our way of life' in a society and culture that seems to be gradually slipping out of our grasp.     Woodbridge suggests there is a positive alternative to this negative assault on society, along the lines of vital Christianity flourishing in the midst of society and culture.  A safer society may not be the most productive goal for a Christians involvement in the world, but rather living a vital, distinctive life that will touch all aspects of culture due to the prescence of believers in it, making contributions over a broad area of influence.  The latter, as a more quiet, personal influence, will be more significant because of the genuinenesss and long-term resilience of the personal relationships upon which it is built." *End Excerpt*  I have little to add.  Our life drive should be establishing the Kingdom on earth, and existing within the body of believers as a community...and through this serving the Lord and eachother to the fullest extent possible.  I pray that I/we am not blinded by our own selfishness and/or pride as we try to follow what the Lord has for us within these relationships. grace and peace..brian estabrook

      Thought you'd like to see this; it's the thing I read last week.  Understanding Ministry: Koinonia   From the Introductory Study Guide: Understanding Ministry  By Dennis McCallum and Gary DeLashmutt  What is koinonia?  "The early Christians 'continuously devoted themselves to fellowship.' (Acts 2:42) The word for 'fellowship' is koinonia, which means 'to have in common' or 'to share.' As those who are united with Christ, we are to share the life of Christ with one another in a way that results in individual and corporate spiritual growth. This is accomplished through the exchange of God's love and truth, which is called 'ministry' (which simply means 'service').  "Koinonia is viewed by the New Testament as a non-optional environment for spiritual growth.  "Clearly such koinonia is not just a matter of attending one or two meetings a week. It is much more than that. This is why the verse so often used to stress the importance of attending church (Hebrews 10:25 '. . .not forsaking the assembling together as is the habit of some. . .'), is frequently misunderstood today. This verse is often taken to mean that only our presence at church meetings is necessary. Instead, we find that according to 1 Cor. 12:21 ('. . .the eye cannot say to the hand, `I have no need of you'. . .'), it is not just the presence of the other members that we need, but also their function.  "Christians are viewed as the body of Christ because we are spiritually united with Christ and with each other. Since we are members of one another, we need to relate to each other in a mutually interdependent way. The important point, therefore, is not just that we attend meetings (although this is a necessary aspect), but that we authentically share the life of Christ with one another. Thus, '. . . speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all aspects into Him who is the Head, even Christ, from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.' (Eph. 4:15,16).  How can we practice koinonia?  "The New Testament defines normative involvement in Christian koinonia in two major ways. One way is by serving other Christians with our spiritual gifts and receiving others' service through their spiritual gifts. The sphere in which we use our gifts is our ministry, or service.  "Another, and perhaps more basic way to practice koinonia is through loving one another in various practical ways. In Jn. 13:34,35, Jesus told his disciples that they were to 'love one another as I have loved you.' Since they had been with Jesus for several years, they knew how he expressed love to them. Since other Christians would not have this opportunity, the apostles carefully described what this love looks like. Through what are sometimes called the 'one another' imperatives of the epistles, we are given a profile of the ways that we can love one another. Below are examples:   Encourage one another (1 Thess. 5:11; Heb. 3:13; 10:25)  Admonish one another (Col. 3:16; Rom. 15:14)  Confess your sins to one another (Jas. 5:16)  Forgive one another (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13)  Accept one another (Rom. 14:1; 15:7)  Serve one another (Gal. 5:13; Rom. 12:10)  Build up one another (1 Thess. 5:11)  Be hospitable to one another (1 Pet. 4:9)  "As we practice giving love to other Christians in these ways, and as we allow them to express love to us in these ways, we are practicing koinonia and expressing mutual interdependence as members of Christ and one another.  "Christian meetings are important in this regard because they enable us to experience koinonia during the meeting in varying degrees. They also facilitate the meeting of other Christians with whom we can build koinonia-based friendships. New Testament churches commonly met in homes as well as in large groups (see Acts 2:46; 20:20; Rom. 16:5)."

      Wow.  Emerge went well tonight.  I think.  It's hard to tell, since I taught, but at least the worship rocked. It also seemed like the type of koinonia we're seeking in our home group is appealing to the larger community. It should be interesting to see who shows up on Friday.  I'll try to post some of the topics we've discussed later this week.  Peace.

      Last night was great. We had about 20 people! As the evening progressed, people really started to warm up. And they stuck around for a long time, too.  I thought about making this a 'closed' blog so that only group members could access it, but we have the address printed on a bunch of flyers already. Plus, I think that it's good for others to get a glimpse into our little foray into biblical community.  That having been said, I'm going to omit the names (initials only, for now) for the prayer requests that were given tonight. God knows 'em, and most of you can at least remember the faces.   What we're asking God to do... D: Make us focused on giving to each other C: Deliver mom and roommates from substance abuse A: Help in honoring and blessing others, not judging them K: Give wisdom in a specific relationship; comfort sister after her miscarriage J: Give self control and time management wisdom for school, work and relationships D: Develop patience, deliver from fear about future and career S: Create openness A: Help with management of responsibility; "I'm a workaholic" K: Resolve conflict with manager, help to reach co-workers T: "I'm overwhelmed. Way too busy" R: Help with time managment, consistency K: Overcome selfishness "wanting time for me, not God or others J: Give wisdom for prioritization of work and ministry obligations/opportunities S: Help with relationships and families S: Help with readjustment to life after travelling "I'm overwhelmed with options" B: Give power to trust God about an uncertain future T: Deliver friend from theological deception, help in job transition K: Wisdom for a relationship "It's a big mess"  I encourage you to pray about these things all week long, as often as possible. It'll be cool to see what God does.  Pre-loving you all,  John (and Kori)

      It's Friday, January 16, and its 5:45 am.  This is the morning of the day of the evening of our first home group meeting. 559 will be officially launched!  Many people have asked us, "What should I bring?"  Here are a few suggestions, in no particular order:  * A pen or pencil and something to write on * Pop or juice or chips or some snack food to share * A Bible * A friend * A neighbor * An enemy * Your kids, if you have any  A few other people have asked us, "What should I expect this to be like?"  Here are a few answers, in no particular order:  * We don't know exactly * A warm, family gathering * Flexible, somewhat less structured than other groups * Fun * Non-judgmental * Energetic * Funny * Friendly to new people * Occasionally not funny * Intense, at times * The ebullient egg-sac of ennui * Okay, it's early. Sorry about that last one. Don't quite understand it myself.  And some people have asked us, "What's the point?"  Here are a few possible answers, in no particular order: * Most of us are at least a little lonely and isolated * Most of us are too fiercely independent to do anyone any good * All of us need a safe place to work out difficult issues * Everyone needs to be pre-loved, not pre-judged * In a church service, you can show friendliness, but it's hard to really show love * Our neighbors are watching us -- let's show them something they can't explain  We've asked ourselves, "If this works, what could happen?"  Here are a few answers in no particular order: * You could make lifelong friends * You might never have to watch the big game by yourself again * You could make real spiritual progress * Your friends, neighbors and family could see what Jesus is really all about * Marriages, friendships and bodies might get healed * The 'ministries' we participate in could be revitalized * You might learn to make homemade tortillas * You'll never have another lonely Friday night * You might discover new talents and spiritual gifts * You might learn new words, like "ebullient" and "ennui" * You could find your true calling * You could visit homeless camps in Columbus * You might build a house for Habitat for Humanity * You might visit an orphanage in Cambodia * You may learn how to roast coffee * That friend of yours may once and for all turn to Jesus  The list could go (and has gone) on, and on, and on.  We don't know what it will be like exactly.  Tonight, we're going to start talking and praying about it. Ready, fire, AIM!  In all seriousness, we are committed to pre-loving, pre-forgiving, pre-accepting everyone who walks into our home. We're committed to making all of our resources available to all of you as God leads. We believe that we all need each other. We're excited and a little bit nervous.  See you soon,  John and Kori

      Hi!  Just sent out an invitation to about 15 or 20 people, asking them to consider joining the homegroup and the blog. It's by no means a complete list -- it's just whomever I had on my list here at home. The group is truly open to everyone interested in moving towards interdependence and community. If you know of anyone who might be interested in this sort of thing, please invite them.  The first actual group meeting will be on Friday, January 16 at 6:30. Call us at 263.8283 (home) or 447.0906 (John's work).  You'll hear much more about this at Emerge. It's gonna be exciting. We're really looking forward to getting to know you and being a part of your life and your spiritual journey.  Peace.

      Well, hey!  That was easy. Set up the blog in less than a minute.  Now it gets difficult.  Our goal for 559 is to become a diverse group of people moving from radical independence to biblical interdependence. What does that mean? I guess it remains to be seen.  If you want to join this blog (so that you can post comments), or if you want to get more info on the 559 home group, please email me at john@elementdesigngroup.com.  This should be interesting.

      This week at 559, we will be discussing 'Identity in Christ'. The statement that goes along with this sixth core belief is 'I believe I am significant because of my position as a child of God.'   The verse is from John 1:12 and states, 'Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gavethe right to become children of God.' I hope that you all meditate and do some thinking about all this before Friday, and come prepared to talk! This past week's discussion was very productive, and I, at least, left a little better informed than I was when I came. I will be praying for all of you, and I hope that you can use the list below to pray for eachother as well! Have a great week, and if you need anything in the way of prayer or somebody to talk to, please post or comment on the blog so we can all  know how to help/pray for you! Grace and peace,  Brian

The answer to all three of these could come this week, so please be in prayer about what God has for Troy in these situations, and also how WE can support and encourage him. Everybody have a great week, walk as He walked. grace and peace. Brian

      Hello All! Just for your information, this week we will be talking about 'Humanity'. This is the fifth core belief in the series we are doing. Just for reference, we have so far discussed the Authority of the Bible, Church, Compassion and Eternity. The statement that goes along with 'Humanity' is this: 'I believe all people are loved by God and need Jesus Christ as their Savior.' The verse that goes along with this is John 3:16, look it up and read it in context for a good refresher! Come with your thinking caps and an open mind!  grace and peace,  Brian

      hi 559:  I haven't been to 559 lately because of a crazy schedule of student teaching full-time at Delaware Hayes HS and also working 30 hours at OSU.  I have been sick most of it, and well... its hard and I am growing weary about the whole thing... Could you please pray that God would give me the energy and the positive attitude/joy to continue on and be fruitful for the next 7 more weeks of this crazy schedule?  And, that God would also protect me and guide me along this journey ...  Ask Sandy about my "stalker" friend... :(  I hear good things about the group, and I pray that God continues to strengthen and grow the group spiritually in many ways..  Peace.

      Friends, this is Brian. Please take time out of your day to pray for our friend Troy Henley. He has had some setbacks this weekend, and has not made the best choices. He needs our prayer and support!  I would rather let him tell all of us about it on his timing, so for now I will leave it at that.  Please be praying that God renews Troy and refreshes his spirit with a healing touch!!   grace and peace.

      Hi Everyone, Just a quick update on my sister-in-law, Robin. She is home from the hospital and feeling much better. She just needs to regain a little strength at this point. The doctors don't know exactly what happened, but all of her metabolic levels are back to normal now. Thank you for your prayers.  Have fun tonight with the pizza and games. I'm gonna miss it ...

      Hi Everyone, I have another prayer request to share. I just found out from my brother (Ken) that my sister-in-law (Robin)spent last night in the ICU at Riverside and is still there. Apparently she has some sort of acid build-up in her blood (I don't remember the actual name of the condition). She was very sick yesterday and her heart rate had gone up to 150-160. She is slowly stabilizing today but hasn't been released from the ICU yet. They are running more tests to try to determine the exact cause. If you are praying for the group this week, please remember Robin in your prayers. Thanks.  Kevin

      Friends, I'm not exactly sure what we will be doing this week at 559. It is possible that we may have a new speaker this week fresh off his trip to Cambodia! I'm not entirely certain whether John will be up to talking about all of it this week, but I suppose we may just play it by ear.  Maybe we'll sing some worship music this week, you never know! If we continue following our plan, we will talk about 'Personal God' this week. Be thinking about what it means for Jesus to be our Savior in an indivudual sense and in a community sense.  I'll be praying for all of you this week!  grace and peace, Brian

      Hey Everyone, Just a note to say that I'm gonna miss 559 tonight. I'm going up to Jen's tonight after work, instead of after the group like I usually do. She doesn't have the girls tonight, so we have a rare chance to spend some time alone together. You can continue to pray for the house situation. We will be working on getting a sign for the yard and making up flyers this weekend. Pray that the right buyer for the house will come along soon.  Enjoy the group tonight. See you all next week.

      Got this message from Michael Gisinger. Please pray for this situation...  Earlier this week (Tuesday I think), a friend of mine - my #2 groomsman - died from head injuries. He was riding his bicycle to work, wearing his helmet as always. He was found many hours later (they said that his brain went 20 hours without blood) after being listed as a missing person. My suspicions are of a hit-and-run accident, not knowing all the details of what happened, but why would someone being so cruel to not even make an anonymous call.  Anyway, Kevin was about my age - I'm not sure if he was exactly 31 or 32 or what. He leaves behind a wife (Angie) and two young children - Javin is five years old (much younger in the pic), Kailyn is not even five months old. They had just moved into a new house. He also leaves parents (& in-laws), a brother, a church & worship team (he often led), a band, and a job & company he enjoyed and who I'm sure loved him. Many (all?) of us are still in shock. The funeral is this Sunday. Please pray for all involved, especially Angie & Javin, who knew and loved his daddy very well. I'm sure the rest of us could use some support and prayer, too. I know  I don't grasp what God's will is in this - what is the purpose of taking such of loving and loved man from so young a family? But God has His reasons. Please also pray that the truth be found and dealt with however is appropriate.

      Hey everyone, I'm not going to make it to 559 this week (or is it 4023?) but I should be there next week. I wanted to pass along a prayer request though. This past weekend Jen's ex-husband told her that he wants joint custody of the girls (it's called "shared parenting"). That's where they live for a week with one parent and then the next week with the other parent - back and forth. With the divorce agreement they currently have filed with the court, she has full custody and he gets visitation every other weekend plus two evenings a week for a couple of hours. He doesn't even use much of that visitation time he's allowed now (virtually none of the weekday visits, and only about half of the weekends). The scary part though is that, in this fallen world we live in, a judge would almost certainly grant him that if he asked for it. Jen's lawyer told her that when she first met with her.  So we're asking for prayer that God would change his heart and open his eyes to the fact that this would not be best for the girls. We're not sure if he's serious about it (it came up when they were arguing about something on the phone - and he threatened this before but quickly dropped it). But we just don't know right now. This would brake Jen's heart terribly (and mine too), but we're really praying that he will at least see that this would be terrible for the girls. We really believe that. So pray for the Lord to change his heart so that he does not pursue this. And for strength, wisdom and peace for Jen and I to get through this situation.  Thanks. I look forward to seeing everyone next week. Kevin

       I haven't really been to 559 a whole lot...    like 3 times..         But, I appreciate being included on your emails, etc. Its hard to get there, and kind of enjoying some down time with grad school being out for the last few weeks and just working full-time. I wanted to write for prayer for my family. I have a brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces  (i.e.,  http://homepage.mac.com/traceyward/nieces/PhotoAlbum5.html  - first pic)  that are planning on going to Malaysia as missionaries, which is a good thing to have missionaries...     But, thus the rub...   For some reason, my brother and fam seem to be really angry about the process and seem to be really divisive and against everyone. NOT sure if they don't have a peace about it, or what is up... but, its pretty destructive and hurtful to everyone else... I may see them this weekend, and I am not sure what to do.. Parents are upset, brother isn't talking to them, and just seems like a LOT of chaos. Could you please pray for some wisdom/direction/discernment. ~ why can't we just all get along? ~  Peace.. see you all at Emerge!  ~tracey

      So, my wife's at the pool with my kids.   A little boy walks up, looks at my sons and says to Kori, "So, what are they, Chinese or Japanese?"  "Neither. Chien is Vietnamese American, Pak is Korean American."  "Well, what does that mean?"  "That means that they're American, just like you."  Boy leaves.  Boy returns and says, "Are you sure they're not Chinese, 'cause they look Chinese to me."  "I'm sure."  "Are they bi?"  (at which point, I would have answered differently, probably, but that's just 'cause I'm more in touch with my feminine side than most)  Kori replies, "No."  "Are you their mother?"  "Yes"  The boy pauses and looks at my sons again. "So, do they look like their dad?"  At this point, Chien bursts out laughing, and says, "No, my dad's much sillier!"  Boy leaves.  Boy returns. "So, how old are they?"  "Chien is 6 and a half, Pak is 5 and a half."  Boy pauses and thinks. "Are they twins?"   ----  Epilogue: Next time the boy walks up, Kori starts to ask him some questions for a change. Turns out his name is Gabriel. His brother's name is Adrian.  Chien asks, "He's a boy. Why's he named Adrienne?"  ----  Moral of the story: If you don't like answering questions, don't have any kids.

      559ers! Here's the latest!  For this Friday (August 6th) PLEASE READ 1 Corinthians Chapter 2.  (It's not too long. You can do it in one sitting!)  Last Friday we talked about 1 Cor. 1 and enjoyed some great discussion.  Bring questions, points of interest, or any other thoughts that relate to the text that you'd like to discuss.  We might even discuss points that  don't  relate to the text, if they seem to be of great enough import!  Here are the prayer requests from Friday, for those of you who like to be reminded throughout the week:  A- praise that God has provided guidance and answers,  as she'll be staying in Ohio! Also, pray for driving safety- she'll be travelling back to N.C. this week.  C- Continued prayer for the job search.  S- Brother's oldest son in Maine needs prayer.  Also pray for family friend's divorce.  K- praise for nephew! He got his tongue clipped and should be able to function better now!  K&J- child custody issues need lots of prayer.  Also pray about the house showings, as time is dwindling.   Praise- K's brother, the police sergeant, came out of the car chase/shooting unscathed!  A- been feeling overwhelmed!  Pray for peace, for rest, and for her to worry less!  L- girl with brain tumor (Jennifer)- pray for recovery, and for the remaining part of the tumor to be healed.  A- Cousin really needs Christ.  B- Praise & Prayer- guidance as he continues seeking where it is that God wants him.  Please also pray for Jay & Debi (and ashton and spencer) as they travel this week.  We'll miss them for the next 2 weeks!  Also, continue to keep Troy in your prayers.  If I hear anything about how he's doing or where he is now, I'll let you know.  Anything else? hmm... we miss John and Kori and the kiddos lots. If you haven't done it already, go to the previous post and read John's note-  ..  :)  That's all. See ya Friday. Read 1 Corinth. 2 !  Catch ya on the flip side!

      Hey.  John here.  Just wanted to say 'thanks' to all of you for being such an important part of our life. And 'Thanks' specifically for the kind gifts you gave to Kori and I on our last night at Emerge.  We think about you all, and pray for you all.  And you're all welcome to stop by our house whenever. Same goes for my office.  We'll stop back into 559 and Emerge periodically. We care about all of you, and are confident that the ministry will grow as you continue down the path you're on.  Good work!  Thanks a million,  John
