      Mental note to self: DON'T FORGET THAT DANIEL'S CELL IS IN YOUR HAND Do the WH homework... DON'T FORGET GEOM BOOK (or else will die) And add rockthesocks to buddy list, because this person STOLE MY ORIGINAL SN and I want to see who could POSSIBLY be so cool as to steal MY MAD COOL SCREEN NAME!!!! Hah... okay, lol.  It was really sad today... they were out of pizza....  So I got nachos, and I felt very messy, but it made me laugh so it was OKAY!  I also had several other interesting things happen to me today which will remain unsaid until a later time, when the school bell isn't ringing....  Yeah, that'd probably be really, really good.  MMMMM YEP, OKAY!!!!!  Goodbye!!! Love, Lily

      Life is... really weird.  I don't know if I'm the only one that's ever noticed this, but damn.  Crazy madness.  Things are so much fun, though, it's ridiculous.  Life... I don't know if I can even explain it.  I mean....  Grah.  People sound stupid when they try to say something profound, so I guess I'll just try to hurry it up and spare everyone the agony of reading this. Bravery tastes sweet. It really does.  Being a spineless coward only has it's comfort for so long, until one day a person just goes... "FUCK IT" and goes out and does something incredibly stupid....  But sometimes that incredibly stupid thing is also incredibly brave, and it feels so damn great. Hmm, what else do I have to be happy about?  God....  I'm listening to Atom and his Package, which kicks major ass.  It's a song called "He Kissed Me".  It starts of with the guy going... "Hey guys, this is a song about a guy who kissed me on the face." Heh heh heh.  IT MAKES ME LAUGH.  Oooh who is this?  My playlist surprises me all the time.  It sounds like either Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, or MxPx.  WHO IS IT?? *suspense* *suspense* *suspense* IT'S MxPx!!!!!!!  WOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  I am in such a good mood.  This is so sad.  I wish that Liz and Kait were here, though.  That's the ONLY DARK SPOT on my parade.  My life would be PERFECT if they were here.  Grah.  Why couldn't Boise be sucked through a warp hole and fused with League City or something?  How cool would that be?  I'd DIE. Dum dee dum....  In such a good mood....  I need to call Kait, though.  I think she's not doing too well.  It needs to be summer NOW.  I need a job, concerts, and a cell phone so that I can talk to people ALL THE TIME.  *dances around in circles* I'm gonna go now, so BYE!!!!!  Much love, Lily

      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!  I forgot to say that's by the AQUABATS!!!!  They're... different.  And I don't really know why I'm still talking, except possibly margaritas and general cool happy times and POSSIBLY a guilty conscience, which I just tried to spell with a "q".  I think I'm actually done now.  This is exciting....

      IT'S MY FIRST POST!  This is cool, because the blogger dude is cooler than livejournal, although my livejournal has pretty cool colors.  Reminds me of mint chocolate chips or something.  Ehhhh whatever.  HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  I found out what torpid means!!!!  I feel much more intelligent than I did three seconds ago.  I felt bad because TYLER was LAUGHING at me because I didn't know....  I really need to start reading again.  My vocabulary is DYING.  Like an old person.  And that sucks. Hmmmm what else do I have to say?  I dunno.  I just wrote a 16 page letter to a friend in Boise.  How mad is that?  I really need a life. .... Texans are weird.  All of them.  I have not met a sane one yet, and it's CRAZY.  I don't know what to do with them.  I suppose I'll join their happy insanity eventually, but until then I will stare at them nervously and hope to god that they don't attack me.  Crazy, crazy people, all of them.  I don't think I have anything else to write right now, so I'll leave you with some mad lyrics!!!  "I was in my lab, creating what I thought would be, well, something great for the world.  A two headed cat!  You could pet one kitty’s head while you pet the other kitty’s head….  But little did I know that atomic energy would turn this cat into a man-eating monster!  The cat with two heads, whooooaaaaa, whooooaaaaaa, the cat with two heads!"  Love, Lily

      There is a break in my lies over in the sidebar.  I am unsure about how to handle this.  I think I will just be okay with it, and possibly name it.  Names are good.  The break in my lies will then become a malevolent entity and do all sorts of unspeakable things over there between the working links.  But what to name it?  I dunno, I should probably get some sleep.  I am, however, determined to use up all of my computer time, which may or may not be a healthy thing.  What IS a healthy thing is family movie time.  I, generally speaking, hate family time UNLESS it is a worthy movie and has no crappy moral that drives the entire movie. Don't get me wrong; what's the point of a movie if it's not trying to prove something?  But I just can't stand it when... ugh.  I dunno how to explain it, but I think you know what I mean.  Most of the movies you find in the family section at blockbusters are the evil movies, and I (mostly) hate them.  To be fair, SOME of them are good, but....  That's only a tiny minority against the raging, shitty masses. Anyways, to my point. I had such a great day today.  I woke up at seven this morning, got into my bathing suit, and took off with my family down to Surfside beach for some FUN in the SUN which resulted in my sunscreen wearing off and my shoulders and cheeks getting horribly fried.... But oh well, right?  The thing that is creepy/cool about right now is that I can still feel the undertow and stuff.  Like you know how after you ride a merry-go-round all day, when you lay down at night you can still feel yourself spinning around?  Just like that, and it's FREAKING me out becuase I keep wanting to grab onto something to keep myself from being pulled out. But, right.  After we left the beach (and after eating yummy apricot jelly/peanut butter sandwiches) we drove around in Galveston for a while (I fell asleep) and then shot off home.  Once in the comfort of my own four walls, I promptly covered myself with aloe vera in an attempt to prevent the unsightly peeling of my (red) skin.  My family was then dragged to Outrigger's for a upper middle class burger (cannot beat Billy's Burger in Jackson Hole, WY).  I enjoyed (not) the sun on my arms, or the clothing in general (lots of pain, poor me...).  Despite all that I had a blast.  We then ran off BACK to the house, where conversation was made about washing my dad's car.  I avoided this topic and gently demanded that we watched Joe Versus the Volcano. I demanded this for several reasons, one of which being that it is possible the rockingest movie ever.  That's not to say that it has good special effects or a reasonably coherent plot.  Pshaw, that'd be STUPID.  It does, however, present Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, a shitload of philosophical mumblings, and a huge-ass ant-hill (can't think of anything) of symbolism.  That movie kicks ass, to say the very least. It ALSO makes a debut in TWO of my links.  Woohoo!  Anyways, I think my skin was just torched, so I'm going to go find some aloe vera and take a bath in it.

      Yes, well, hello.  I changed my template because I changed it all so horribly that I forgot what I was doing and... yes.  Well, for those that saw it (Von) I pity you.  HAHAHA!!!  That reminds me!  My life is now complete!  I now know someone (more or less) named Von.  There was a mild case of mistaken identity but I HAVE PREVAILED and know EVERYTHING (nothing) about him!  MUWAHAHAHA!!!!  *cough* Yeah. Anyways. Neil Young.  Who is neil young?  I know he's famous, and I'm fairly certain it's for being musically gifted, but....  *shrugs*  Eh.  Not everyone can be so completely sophisticated in their musical tastes. JUST KIDDING.  I'm really not that much of a jerk, most of the time.  I think I have to be going, I'll probably post again during Health.  BYE!

      OH MY GOD.  You have NO IDEA HOW  UTTERLY COOL THIS IS!  I am a very excitable person, as you can see.  I sometimes wonder if I am one of those happy people that everyone else hates, and that thought frightens me.  It is during these times that I wonder whether I should decide to be depressed so that I can be fashionable, but then I remember how stupid and completely worthless being depressed is, and decide against it. Yes. Well. Anyways: as to my joy!  I HAVE JUST REALIZED SOMETHING!  Not only is my screen name (rockthesocks74) a clever devotion to Green Day, it is also a SUBLIMINAL message to tell you all to go read Return to Sender over there in my links.  Oh, crap.  Well, I guess it's not too subliminal anymore, but I am to EXCITED about this to GIVE A FUCK!  Because... because... look: R..ock T...the S...socks  OR!!!!  R...eturn T...o S...ender  I AM THRILLED.  Aaaaand obviously off of my medication....

      Knowing Texan people is a bad thing.  Why?  Becuase I have come under very bad influences, and it is WARPING MY MIND and I think that I'm on the verge of becoming an unsavory character.  I assume, however, that it will be a rather obscene amount of fun.  You can see how I am divided upon such moral quandries as displayed here. Interesting, yes?  Well, I think so.  Crap, I only have approximately five minutes left of joyful internet capering.  This saddens me, and fills me with pain at the prospect of reliving last night's insomnia.  It was very boring and very tiring, and I don't feel good.  I need to go wash my face.

      This is crap.  I've been messing around with my little template craphead, and I MADE NO ERRORS but it won't let me add exploding dog OR Scary Go Round to my pretty mad links.  Grrrr.  That really upsets me.  Not only is exploding dog REALLY MAD artwork, it has a pretty cool name, too.  And scary go round (which I have regrettably not read in a while) is just... cool.  And funny.  So, cool and funny, yes.  There ought to be an adjective to encompass all of that mad doom.  If there is, let me in on the know.  Tell me baby girl, cuz I need to know (I need to know).  NOOOOOO!!!  Isn't that Marc Antony?  What the HELL is he doing in my head?  WEll, whatever the reason, he needs to get out NOW becuase Weezer wants in there instead.  SPEAKING of Weezer, I was happily downloading all sorts of cool new things, and I found this GREAT NEW SONG--- Crap. Gotta go.

      Okay, this post is mostly a self reminder thing (actually, that's all that it is).  But I had my whole music list written out on a newspaper (because that was the only thing around when I was watching fuse the other day) and... *cough*  Well, anyways.  My mom is recycling it, so I'm just gonna post this up here super fast because I can't find a pen. MUSIC TO DOWNLOAD AND/OR BUY WHEN I MIRACULOUSLY COME INTO MONEY: The Corals (probably just download) The Shins (again, probably just for Kazaa) TV on the Radio (that music video kicked my ass) The Unicorns-- Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? (MUST HAVE THIS CD) Of Montreal Starlight Mints Green Day Motion City Soundtrack (remind me to email him again, please....  AND RANDY.  God, I keep forgetting.  And I need to email Squid... and Mitch... GAH!) Reel Big Fish The Strokes  *reviews list*  Yes, I think this will do to remind myself.  These blogs are very handy.  I WILL NEVER FORGET ANYTHING EVER AGAIN!!!  WOOOHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  And tomorrow's monday!  HOW CAN I FAIL TO BE THRILLED ABOUT THINGS???  I am, however, apprehensive, becuase bad luck must catch up with me eventually, right?  Law of Balances, right?  MAYBE I AM AN ANOMALY IN NATURE!!!!!  How utterly cool would that be?  Pretty damn cool.  Yep.  Yep, okay.  I'm gonna go do my homework now.  Much love, Lily

      This blogpost is for the sole purpose of seeing my blog in the "Most Recently Updated" thing.  I love seeing my awesomeness in BOLD on a webpage.  It makes me feel so distinguished and special!  I have more Sordid Details of My Life to lay before you fools later.  GUESS WHAT??  That stupid fucking email that I sent to Space Twins... was returned to me in the jaws of the evil, vile yahoo mailer demon thing.  Aaanyways.  Gonna run now.

      So anyways, how cool is that?  I was wandering aimlessly around the internet being sad about not actually posting anything important on my site, when I DECIDED something!  I decided that I was going to be CONSTANTLY and OBSESSIVELY in the know about Weezer.  With this decided I trekked off to google to google "weezer news" and let someone else to the lookup work for me.  At any rate, the page popped up (like it usually tends to do) and THERE IT WAS!  The most AMAZING thing EVER!  Hailed as NOT a side project but separate musical entity APART from Weezer was the band... THE SPACE TWINS!  YES!  THE SPACE TWINS! After I was done hyperventilating, I checked it out.  Seeing as I'm on a school computer, I am sadly without speakers and could not, therefore, enjoy the forty second clips they had.  Sad and alone, I meandered over to the Tour Diary thing and was SHOCKED at the witty accounts of the humorous ventures of the poor bandmembers in TEXAS!  THEY'RE IN TEXAS!  Sadly, they are not enjoying my home state.  I'd bake them cookies to try to make up for it or something, but A: they would sit on my counter until my sister ate them because B: how the HELL would I get them cookies? Anyways, I emailed them (they're going to hate me because I've fallen in love with them before actually listening to their music), and I EAGERLY await a response!  I sincerely doubt that I'll get one, although I DID hear back from the two other bands that I pestered.  In all seriousness, there is no better thing than getting an email from an exalted bandmember.  Sheesh.  Well, anyways, the bell is about to ring, so YOU'VE BEEN SAVED!  By the bell, I mean. Oh, wait!  QUICK NEWS!  Texans are a bad influence on me.  I skipped for the first time today.  NOOOOO!!!  Not that!  Hope my parents never read this.

      Aaaaarg.  These crappy school computers reall piss me off.  I just spent the last ten minutes (exaggeration) trying to log onto this STUPID COMPUTER and then spent another fifteen million years trying to access the internet.  Anyways, moving on to world news.... Guess what?  Computer God hates me, and really has a deathwish for me.  I'm not even kidding, either.  My internet connection is FINE but iMesh and Kazaa won't connect and ALL OF MY MUSIC THAT WAS IN iMESH WAS DELETED.  I had my starlight mint stuff back!  I had 24 songs by of montreal!  I had a bunch of Reel Big Fish and REALLY what else does anyone need in life??  NOTHING!  Then my sister went and did some stupid shithead thing and decided that she needed to download fifty billion weezer songs and then it all died.  It was sooooo sad!!!  Uh oh, librarian at... there.  okaaaayyy leaving now!

      Hey, it's my traditional three-seconds-before-bell-rings blog post!  YAHOO!  I felt the need to update because I am about to consume a twix bar, chocolate pound cake (made by Allison and without any landslide effect whatsoever), and MINTY GUM!  Nothing, however, about Mentos which makes me very sad.  Do I even like Mentos?  Blearg.  I dunno.  It seems as if it would be a fun thing to like,  don't you think?  Aaaanyways I think that I'm going to get kicked off the computer soon, either because Allison has come to drag me away, or the evil, nutty librarians have decided that I am not using the computers in a wholly wholesome way.  EVIL, BAD BLOG!!!  Yikes, okay, she's looking at me!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

      You know.... it's really sad that I had no idea what the lyrics for that song were.  How utterly pathetic is that?  Hmmm well whatever.  Despite the fact that  I've been singing that song WRONG (that's the most embarrassing thing ever), it still rocks the mad beans.  Seriously.  That song is... sooo.... COOL!  Courtesy of the Pinkerton album.  GUESS WHAT!!!  I have ALL FOUR Weezer CDs, because I am a crazed, maniacal, and redundant fan.  I only have to get those two cool extra CDs and I'll be MADE!  RAAAAAAAHHH!!!!  I have a story to relate.  Later.  Because... bell.  Anyways, hello allison!!!  (hahahaha!!!!)

Come down on the street and dance with me     I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting  I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me     I asked you to go to the Green Day concert  You said you never heard of them  -How cool is that?-  So I went to your room and read your diary:  "watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack through a press table..." and then my heart stopped:  "listening to Cio-Cio San fall in love all over again."     How stupid is it? I can't talk about it  I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart  (How stupid is it? Won't you give me a minute  Just come up to me and say hello to my heart) How stupid is it?  For all I know you want me too and maybe you just don't know what to do or maybe you're scared to say: "I'm falling for you"  I wish I could get my head out of the sand 'cuz I think we'd make a good team  and you would keep my fingernails clean  but that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize  'cuz I can't even look in your eyes without shakin', and I ain't fakin'  I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon.   -El Scorcho, Weezer   ONLY THE COOLEST WEEZER SONG EVER!!!

Well, yeah, I think that's probably going to be the gist of this one, becuase I really don't have enough time to say anything particularly important.  SO, as a result I'm going to simply babble and take up time until someone I recognize as being something.  WHEN THIS BLESSED EVENT OCCURS I shall run of to my joyful eighth period, becuase it's fun and I like cheese OOOH WOOOH WAAAAH WOOOOOO!!!!  okay, yeah, done with that.  I REALLY need to not let people feed me chocolate during seventh period.  BAD NEWS, MAN.  Okay, leaving now, BYE!!!!

      You know....  Blearg.  Yeah, that's what I have to say about things in general.  I was reading a friend's blogger (won't say names because, well... weird) and it depressed me.  She (okay, since she is the only one that reads this, this is a dead give-away) posted about Love, and how stupid and pathetic it is, and how it's not really anything in particular.  She says that Love is just something that hardly ever appears, and/or that it's the delusion of a sick and twisted mind. Am I painfully optimistic and naive, or is she cynical?  I can't decide.  It's like Don Quixote and his servant... the idealist and the realist.  But I WILL NOT BE SWAYED from my ideas on Love, as stupid as they may be. "Love is like oxygen, love lifts you up to where you belong, all you need is love!" -Ewan McGregor, Moulin Rouge. Yeah, that's kind of how I see it.  Don't get me wrong, I believe that Love is one of the most completely terrible weapons out there.  I mean, really....  Ever notice how "hate" is not the opposite of "love"?  The opposite of love is APATHY.  Aaaannnnd you can't really hate someone unless you loved them once, or that person endangered someone or something you loved.  Soooo technically aren't love and hate two extremes of just feeling in general?  Anyways, the Phantom of the Opera really screwed me over as far as love goes. That stupid book really showed me what people are trying to convey when they say love.  It really explained the sheer magnitude of the concept....  The word LOVE encompasses rage, jealousy, joy, passion.....  All that fun stuff.  That's I guess why even thinking about love freaks me out.  I think (and I agree with allison on this point) that most people never even come close to what love truly is.  Most people experience some distant echo of that... whatever love is.  But some people get there, and I think it's good to keep trying.  But I'm going to save that goddamn word for when I really mean it, and so far I think I've said it (aside from little kiddie "I love you, mommy!"s) a grand total of three times.  Maybe.  Well, enough philosophical babble. TO... something else, now!

      RAAAAAAHHH!!!!  Latin is FUN!  Woohoo!  I have... a certain amount of time which will presumably end up being about a minute before the bell rings and I have to run off to class BRIGHT RED!  This will, unusually, not be because I am blushing bright red from complete and total embarrassment, but will instead be due to the pretty cool sunburn I am now sporting.  I know I've been complaining about it for the last few posts, but when something is on one's mind so totally.... I am a whiny baby, and someone probably ought to shoot me because I am irritating.  Hmm I don't think that would end up being very good, becuase, you know: dead.  As in, not living, and incapable of doing cool things like, oh I dunno.  Try sucking in a breath?  Anyways, I really SHOULD be going because that was the two minute bell but I REALLY do not want to use my energy for such a BAD THING.  Okay, leaving now.

      Hmm yes well isn't that nice?  I got SUN-FRIED!  If you notice how I avoid spelling what a sun... torchage of the skin is generally called.... CONGRATULATIONS!  I am avoiding this word because I have temporarily forgotten how to spell it.  Is it burned or burnt?  I could probably just check with the helpful little spell-check things, but that would make things much easier than they have any right to be. Besides. ...... Crap, I have no more reasons.  Alright, I'm just a brainless idiot, OH WELL.  Deal with it, becuase IT IS NOT CHANGING unless I decide to rule the world.  As of yet I have three friends (Paige, Erin, and Allison) who are intent upon this lofty aspiration, and I have no wish to contend with them over such a defective thing as Earth seems to be. Um, what else do I have to say?  Not a whole lot, really.  I watched Swordfish on Saturday (you know, with Hugh Jackman, John Travolta, and Halle Berry?) AAAAAAAHHHHHH TWO MINUTE BELL.  I will post later, hopefully during Health.  Okies, bye!

      Well, now it's Monday morning and I'm in much more of a writing mood than I have been in all weekend.  This, I suppose, is a good thing.  Sadly, there are enough BAD things about this morning to make up for it, so I guess it all evens out.  My locker smells like something died in it.  It is... Nasty, to use a polite term.  Very... very... very  nasty. Oh, how INTERESTING!  I just tried italics on this stupid thing for the first time and it looks funny.  It's one of those... html... things.  I have no idea what I'm talking about, and I can still smell my locker.  I am in the LIBRARY now.  I should not smell my locker.  So, either the stench has been imprinted on my brain and not until death does my brain (and, thus, the smell) die....  OR the option with the higher probability of correctness, which is that it hooked little tiny evil smell-feet into my clothing.  I, luckily, have solutions for each of those problems (excepting the rather grievous grammatical landmine).  If it's God's version of psychological warfare, I will inhale altoids and explode my sinuses and my brain.  If it's on my clothing then I will proceed to inhale the altoids AND drench myself with perfume (which wears off in three seconds anyways).  My plan is that I WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT which is really what counts.  I have to live with myself after all.  THEY all just have to sit with me for an hour a day. Hmmmm....  I'm gonna go check what I already posted about this weekend, because I can't remember very well.  TEN MINUTE BELL, OH HOW I DREAD THY COMING!

      Bitches.  My stupid computer (Baxter) is a basketcase and refuses to let me make things bold.  I have used my remaining energy to hyperventilate about Motion City Soundtrack's Justin Pierre emailing me.  I think I'm right at the point of beginning to break down the protein in my muscles to use as energy.  My madre is making me go to bed an hour early (I must sound like a moron, but... one must not fight the all-powerful will of the competely terrifying Mother Figure, because... scary) which sucks floppy donkey dick, to use Liz's term.  I probably need it, though.  I slept through all of school today... EVEN LATIN!  That never happens, but the lights were off and we were watching this boring Latin thing and my headphones were beckoning and REALLY there was no reason to stay awake....  Blearg indeed. By the way... Modest Mouse fucking rocks.

      AHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!  I saw it.  I SAW IT!  Woohoo... It was the last on the list, and I am sad about this, but look on the bright side!  I was the last to publish during the minute of 32 in the hour of 1!!!  Yesssssss... happy diabolical days.  Latin time, latin time....   I should make a song about Latin time.  It is my own personal theory that I will fail Latin time because I have an A, and therefore have an unhealthy habit of avoiding schoolwork under the excuse that one assignment couldn't hurt my grade THAT much.  Sadly, accumulated zeroes can do odd, negative things to a grade.  This is a lesson that I wish to avoid at all costs, but I'm afraid that I've already been educated.  Whether I actually pay attention to my lesson is another matter entirely.  BUT WHATEVER, it doesn't really matter that much.  I mean--- NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!  Now I feel bad.....  I was THINKING and so didn't see Tyler (was actually unsure of whether I was too annoying to talk to-- damn my insecurity problems!) and he was... "grrr".  AND SO NOW I FEEL BAD.  Crap.  I am in a state of either perpetual guilt or... *cough*  You know.  Not.  Wow, see?  Case in point.  Must cut Tyler open and retrieve brain.

      I didn't get to enjoy the novelty of seeing my blog on the "most recently updated".  I don't remember whether I actually posted that or not but it leaves me with a profound sense of sadness anyways. Moving on.... Not much is new in life right now.  I was forced to walk a mile today in PE, which I did not appreciate.  I am now sitting in the computer lab for Health, doing this Power Point Presentation on obesity with my friend banish.  I, being the creative genius, did the writing and she's having a blast messing around with the background and such.  She's got little fat men all over the page now.  It amuses me. Let's see....  Next I have to go to Math, which is BAD NEWS.  Why is it bad news?  I'll tell you why: because I gleefully failed the last geometry test because I can't seem to wrap my mind around a simple little concept like similarity and those stupid goddamn setup algebra equations.  Gah, kill them I say.  Hit me anytime with proofs; I'm kind of good at them (as good as I can be at math, anyways) but KEEP THE GODDAMN SIMILARITY RATIOS AWAY FROM ME! Whoo, need to remember to breathe....  If you noticed, I've become another thing!  I was wandering around the internet (bored out of my mind-- would you believe I signed off before my time was done?) and I stumbled across this Cowboy Bebop theme song test that I had taken a while before.  The first time (a few years ago) I took it and my song was "Blue".  There is no coincidence that the song is played during a death scene and that it is titled "Blue".  I was a sad, sad girl.  Anyways, I took it again later after I had gone crazy and my song was "Go Go Cactus Man" and NOW it's "Cats on Mars". I find this peculiar. Why am I not listening to music?  This bothers me.  I will now go fetch my headphones from the depths of the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS THAT IS MY BACKPACK and happily listen to the pretty cool Reunion Show.

      It just occurred to me that I am somewhat akin to a stalker.  Why, do you ask?  HAH!  As if you even have to ask!  I am all for telling; in fact I love to share all the sordid details (well, not ALL of them) about my life!  At any rate, I'm probably going to get a restraining order on me rather soon.  Or Motion City Soundtrack and/or The Reunion Show will write a song about a stalker (me) who wouldn't leave a friend (them) alone, and she kept talking to them (email) and wouldn't shut up about meeting (matrimony) and they're going to fucking hurt her (my) pansy (weak) ass ( >) and peel the skin off her (my) face (death is imminent). Aaaaahhhhh oh well.

Besides that minor thing, things are going just dandily in the little life of me.  I got the Motion City Soundtrack CD (finally) which is good but not as good as The Reunion Show, which is what I am now craving.  By a strange twist of fate, this is also the CD which I have conveniently left behind in  my happy little room.  Yeah, well I see my buddy coming, so BYE!

      I really sometimes wish I was stupid.  If I was stupid I wouldn't have to care as much, you know?  I don't want to generalize; I've never been that stupid, so I don't know how it is....  But you read things, and you see things, and sometimes.... People are shitheads.  That's also a generalization, but it's true, too.  They don't.... Sometimes I think that love is the worst thing God could have ever created.  I suppose it's necessary to the human race, but it hurts.  And something like love shouldn't hurt... but it does.  Stupid God and his stupid inventions.

      Blah biddily.  I am having an exhausting weekend.  As I may or may not have said already my friend Brittney came down from Boise.  I got to skip school on Friday, which made me sad because I didn't get to see my friends there, but I was also happy because we went to the beach. At the beach I was sad because we were attacked and pooed upon by seagulls.  I was happy at the beach because we terrorized fellow beachers and beat up the waves with great vigor. Upon the completion of our mini-stay at the beach I was utterly wiped out and slept on the way home.  Once AT home, the children were fed fake pizza and made to watch Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.  Brittney's small brother Austin enjoyed this greatly, while I amused myself otherwise by the visual and audio consumption of Eddie Izzard, the transvestite.  This was fun.  I then wished to enjoy more mind numbing television, but was hampered by the fact that everyone else hungered for bedtime.  I strove mightily for an extended amount of time awake, but alas, I failed.  So, I slept. And then I woke up and ate a Krispy Kreme thing, which made me sick.  I ate another one because it was tasty, and that made me sick too.  We then watched Independence Day, which was followed by great whooping and hollering because it is a kickass movie, involving Will Smith and shiny objects. I am unfortunately encountering great distress because I am feeling homicidal and am desperately needing "alone time".  Alas, as there is company, I am reduced to being short and waspish, which led to what I fear was a rather rude greeting to my friend.  As soon as I am given a moment I shall dial her number and wait for someone to pick up the phone, thereby saving me from the monotonous ringing, and I will then apologize for being short. But, I must go.  FARE THEE WELL!

      Rah, hey!  I am a little whore, I think.  I have this problem about asking people on devart to marry me.  Bad, you know.  Very bad, possibly unhealthy.  SCREW IT ANYWAYS!  I find great amusement in their quite hilarious refusals.  Yeeeeaaahhhhh well anyways.  What's been up in MY LITTLE WORLD lately?  Nothing much, actually.  We just finished TAKS testing (finally) and I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL TOMORROW!  How hard does that rock?  I'm really, REALLY excited about that.  Brittney came into town last night with her brother and parents, and so I had to be really quiet this morning because she was sleeping on the couch. Heeheehee, it's gonna be fun because I plan on attempting another revolt against the pop culture that has implanted itself in her mind.  My past endeavors have been for naught, but I shall not fear!  My attempts will not be in vain!  Except, you know... when she chooses Twista over Muse or something. *sigh* Oh well.  I've become a music snob and feel upset about this, but I suppose one can't help but feel that the music that one is obsessed with is automatically superior to all other kinds.  I suppose I shall just have to accept the fact that PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT and it kind of amuses me anyways. Seriously, Britt and I should be a WB sitcom or something.  It's like... prep meets... not prep.  It cracks me up when she's not driving me crazy.  Ahahaha, we used to get into the BIGGEST god awful fights.  Wooohoo!  Party on, man. It's gonna be a blast having her visit.  We're going to go to the beach which is the object of scorn among my fellow Texans on Saturday.  Aaahhhh it'll be fun anyways. GOOGLE HAS AN EMAIL SERVICE?  How fucked up is that?  Pretty damn weird if you ask me....  Gotta jet, now!

      I have developed a new... something.  I know I'm not the greatest philospher out there or anything....  But seriously.  What is the point of believing someone else's philosophies if you can't... you know.  Apply it to your own life?  And what is a better way to apply it than to make your own???  Aaaannnnyways, it's not THAT serious... well.  I guess it kind of is, since it applies to my entire reason for existence.... Since philosophers like to name their... thingies (I did not mean that the way it came out), I'll name mine too!!!!  I'll call this one... THE SOUL OF ROCK!  AAAAAAAAAAAAND here it is!  Because... way too lazy to actually rewrite all of it.  Also, my brain is dead right now as a result of too much inhalation of philosophy, and so I wouldn't really even be able to make it sound pretty....  So, yeah.  Stupid, yes.  Kind of childish, yes.  Irresponisble, yes.  My life's philosophy, yes.   *************: I'm....I don't know what I am. labellily: hmmm labellily: rocker *************: but I don't ALWAYS rock. labellily: doesn't matter labellily: you're always a rocker *************: is that so? labellily: yes *************: *raises eyebrow* how do ya figure? labellily: to rock, one must have the soul of rock labellily: one doesn't turn that on and off labellily: it is always labellily: there *************: you sound like you've put alot more thought into this than I have... labellily: well, when music is one of two things a girl cares about... *************: the other being? labellily: friendship labellily: mom says I have my priorities misplaced labellily: I have to disagree *************: where does she think they should be? boys/kiddies/job? labellily: school labellily: future *************: ah labellily: but seriously, who gives labellily: a flying fuck labellily: about the future labellily: if all you've got is schoolwork labellily: to show for your accomplishments? labellily: I can't believe that the point labellily: of all of this absolutely fantastic life thing labellily: is making money *************: nah, its not. labellily: and stuff labellily: so, yeah labellily: music and friendship *************: *nods* far out. labellily: thanks, I guess  And from there the conversation dissolved into him insulting me about my stupidity and my snappy response (had to fall back on 3rd grade intellect) and, eventually, my sixteenth birthday coming up and it's relative lack of significance.  Gonna kick him whenever I meet him.  HAHAAHAHA!!!  Speaking of kicking people....  Liz's graduation next year.  Ohhhhh yeah, man.  Gonna be wearing steel toed boots to that one....  Jason better watch out...  HAHAHAHAHAHA!

      I had a dream last night that everyone got hooked up to a machine.  Some kind of projector spun a picture out on the wall of the classroom.  My friend Allison had gone first, and the teacher was explaining to us that this machine showed a person's soul.  It was kind of weird... but really cool at the same time.  Allison's frigging soul was up on the wall.  All it really looked like was this fantastic landscape, but the cool part came when the teacher asked her to think of something that made her happy.  These blue waves rolled across the landscape, and the little Allison-figure grinned.  Then she thought of something that pissed her off, and the waves turned red and angry, and the Allison-figure started to look really apocalyptic about things.  Everyone else in the class went, and finally it came to me.  They hooked me up and I looked up at the wall but all I saw was white, with a pathetic mirror image of myself standing there in the middle of all that horrible nothing.  The teacher told me to think of something that made me happy....  I waited for the blue waves to come, and I waited for my figure to smile but the waves didn't come and my figure looked around like she was waiting for something, and then suddenly my figure was smiling....  But there was nothing there.  It was all still white, and she was only smiling because the thing I thought of should of made me happy.  They unhooked me and I tried to smile and make a joke, but everyone just looked at me and they knew my little secret.  I was blank.  There was nothing there. When I woke up I felt dead.

      birds flying high you know how I feel sun in the sky you know how I feel reeds driftin on by you know how I  feel  it's a new dawn it's a new day it's a new life for me and I'm feeling good  fish in the sea you know how I feel river running free you know how I feel blossom in the tree you know how I feel  it's a new dawn it's a new day it's a new life for me and I'm feeling good  dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know butterflies all havin fun you know what I mean sleep in peace when the day is done that's what I mean  and this old world is a new world and a bold world for me  stars when you shine you know how I feel scent of the pine you know how I feel freedom is mine and I know how I  feel  -Feeling Good, Muse (Origin of Symmetry)   That's not to say that I hated things "before".  There are a lot of things (friends, record exchange) that I wish were here now....  But the whole place itself....  It was like that sweater that grandma makes the kid in the sitcoms all the time: it's ugly as hell and itches, but the kid has to wear it because he's  obligated .  Yeah, that's it exactly.  But now things are different.  I have no idea what the future has for me, and it's thrilling.  Back  there  I could look down a street and see myself thirty years later... and nothing about me had changed.  I was scared shitless.  But now....  Maybe this instability isn't healthy.  I don't really know, but it's no better to be so stable you forget to grow.  And if we're going to use the tree analogy... the roots grow and grow and eventually have to reach out to new places, right?  A person can't stay the same and expect to be something.  But then again, maybe I'm rationalizing.  I can't say for certain, but it seems to me like these fresh starts kick way more ass in real life than they do in the movies.  Seriously.  If I could bottle this and sell it to people, I'd be rich.

      Ugh.  Sick.  Apparently there's a new virus going around which is KIND of like the flu... but different.  Different in the way that instead of vomiting all over everything, I only FEEL like vomiting over everything.  And... nausea gets to the point, eventually, where it would be BETTER to just fucking barf than be all NASTY and queasy the rest of eternity. So, anyways.  I stayed home from school sick today.  My parents had to practically tie me down to the bed, because I kept trying to get up for the bus (for once).  WE HAVE NOW ENTERED THE TWILIGHT ZONE.  It was bizarre, but I'm (sort of) glad I stayed home because ooooooh man did I feel gross.  I slept most of the day and had really weird fucking dreams about "piggy bastards" and random things like that.... It was interesting. In totally unrelated news... I feel very bad for Josh, because he has a severely defective girlfriend (me).  I'm grounded, therefore rendering me pretty incapable of doing anything... and then the day I CAN do something I have the NERVE to go and get myself sick.  Yeah... feel bad for him.  But maybe it's just my negative amounts of self-esteem talking.  I dunno.  Let's forget about it right now, and move onto happier, less self-mutilating subjects.  (This is all very sad because I like him very much). Anyways.  I can't spell anymore.  This Texan air is a BAD INFLUENCE and is making my brain cells melt. Oh, hey!  I'm going CRAZY!  I'm getting paranoid, and it's kind of fun.  Rar, I need to not miss Geometry again.  Daniel's gonna try to kick my ass in math whenever I go back to school, and I'll LAUGH at him.  Stupid asshole.   Haha, it was kind of funny.  I was going ballistic during lunch on Tuesday, and Jill and Johnny were freaking out.  Apparently I am never violent and never swear and they can't IMAGINE me going nuts and kicking people in Health class (which I did) and cussing the neighborhood kid out (which I did) and generally making people weird (which I do).  I thought it was amusing. Yarr.  Well.  Need to turn the music (or muzzak) on again, because I'm going CRAZY.  I need a hug.  Yarr.  Read the ninth grade yearbook again today.  I cried.  It was stupid.

      I think I just hyperventilated.  Or, you know.  Something.  At any rate, this is definitely one of the highlights of, oh I dunno.  LIFE.  Whew, breathe deeply.  Try not to fall over.  Good thing about being overly excited... if my brain has an apocalyptic fit from lack of oxygen, I'll just pass out and BREATHE normally again.  Because... wow.  Very exciting day.  WHY????  Let me tell you... non-existent people that don't read my blog anyways....  REASON ONE TO BE EXCITED:   UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT!!!!  So, there's this guy.  This guys name is Josh, and I like him very much.  Want to see the first "conversation" I can remember us having??  It goes something like this: Josh: WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? Me: ...Sarah. And that was pretty much the extent of it until RECENTLY when we actually started talking and... you know.  Having conversations that consisted of more than five words between us.  And then TODAY he got my phone number and there was much calling and now something's going on which may or may not be classified under "one of those high school things" and now I think my heart is trying to bitch slap my stomach.  Or something.  And I keep forgetting to breathe.  REASON NUMBER TWO TO BE EXCITED:  Karen has six days until she turns sixteen and gets to DRIVE IN THE DARK!  Huzzah!  Let's all throw our arms up and CELEBRATE and then mourn the death of the citizens of Boise.  REASON NUMBER THREE TO BE EXCITED:  SCHOOL IS ALMOST OUT!!!!!  Enough said.

      Act your age: 15  Born on what day of the week: I think it was Thursday.  Or Wednesday.  Or... maybe Saturday.  Chore you hate: ... I dunno.  I don't hate chores.  They're just a mildly irritating constant in my life  Dad's name: MIKE Essentail make-up item: LIP GLOSS (Burt's Beewax) because I like... having glossy lips?  Favorite actors/actresses: Ah like... um.  Crap.  Tom Hanks is cool, cuz he's in Joe vs. the Volcano...  Gold or sliver: Silver  Hometown: BOISE  Instruments you play: I snore, so I guess... that kind of counts  Job title: Chief Entertainer of the Family and General Corrupter of the Young and Innocent(ie: sister) Kids: not for a while Living arrangements: I live with my mummy and my daddy and my sister (so, in other words... a crazed and psychopathic pacifist, an obsessive compulsive work-a-holic nutcase and a homicidal bitch) Mom's name: Dorri  Number of socks you own:  that's confidential, bitch (I'm too lazy to count)  Overnight hospital stays: I stayed a few days with my mom when I wasn't BORN and if my DAD did then I guess half of me kind of did...  Phobia: dangling my arms--- FUCK.  I remembered my dream!  There was a CLOWN and it had FANGS and it was RIPPING my right leg apart.  Aaaaahhhhh that bothered me.  Anyways.  Dangling my wrists and ankles over the bed.  I'm scared something's going to grab me.  Quote you like: "Oh my GOD I wanna be a hobo," -Colette, RETURN TO SENDER  Religious affiliation: I belong to the Andy Badke Cello God Extraordinare cult.  And the Satin Aboveground cult.  And the Green Day cult.  And the Feeling Good All the Time cult. Siblings: I gots me one: Megan Time you woke up today: Awake?  Are you serious?  I'm only pretending.  Unusual habits: my door has to be completely closed, if that counts.  And no one may touch my music.  And... ummmmmmmm.  I dunno. Vicious thing you've done: I cussed out the neighborhood kid the other day.... that was kind of mean.  Worst habit: bite my nails, let my sister watch movies she shouldn't be, and making myself apple martinis whenever my parents leave  X-rays you've had: mouth and arm is it, I think  Your favorite season: SUMMER but maybe winter Zodiac sign: cancer    ______  Hey look it's fate!  I was wandering around liz's livejournal and THIS was there!  I knew I was supposed to be doing something silly with the dumb forward shits.  Hah.  WHO WON THAT ONE?  Anyways, there it is and I think I'm done posting, finally.

      SPELLING ERROR.  Christ.  I feel bad now.  So, Health friend not named banish, because the STUPID FUCKING SPELLCHECK DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IT'S TALKING ABOUT.  Actual name: Beenish.  Sorry about that....  OH.  And... Megan and I were watching Requiem for a Dream last night (me because I wanted to, and megan because she craves corruption) and it was good but I ended up singing Rolling Stones all night because I kept thinking about the old lady popping pills and the Rolling Stone's song that keeps talking about "mother's little helper" and how "it helps her on her way, gets her through the busy day" and I don't actually know that it's talking about drugs but it's a really safe guess because everything is about drugs.  So, tip for the future: if someone asks you what a song is about, the safest bet would be to yell "DRUGS!" and look proud of yourself or at least like you know what they're talking about.  With any luck the person will believe you and begin making connections between drugs and the song and your measly ass will be saved.

There was something else I was going to say and I'm getting my hair cut after school today!  HAVE AT THEE, FEIND!  Because I like saying "Have at thee!".  It makes me laugh.  Ummmm damn.

      Heeeeeeey.  Heeeeeeeey!!!!  Hmm yeah well anyways.  I haven't posted in a while because my computer is BROKEN (the little BASTARD) and my dad is petrified that I shall visit the same wrath upon his computer that was visited upon my own.  Only PROBLEM is that daddy is SCARY and the ONLY reason MY computer is shit is because that goddamn iMesh downloaded a spyware thing onto our fucking computer.  Little bastard.  If that netnanny (forever to be known as The Bitch)thing hadn't fucking BLOCKED all the p2p networking we'd still have Kazaa and everything would be HAPPY and, most importantly, not broken. Yarr. What else has been happening in the lovely world of me?  Ummm.  My dog died, which....  Okay.  Ready for a visit into this heartless world of mine?  Here we go: I'm not even remotely sad about her dying.  I mean... I'm going to miss her.  She was a sweetheart and I loved her to death but....  It should be sad, but it's not.  And I'm sad because I'm not sad and it's really stupid and JESUS I think someone just puked in the back of the classroom. ...okay no, it was just someone shuffling cards.  Or something.  Yeah, about that paranoia.... One more day until school's out.  One more day of blessed freedom.  And Josh is going to take me to see that apocalypse movie.  Damn I spelled that really, really incorrectly.  Apocalypse. Crap.  Spell check time.  Word it!  Word it good!  Ahaha!  I got it right!  I love it when that happens. So, I've got writer's block.  I have two stories that I REALLY need to finish, because they have the most reviews and are closer to being finished.... But I keep wanting this ONE (Sympathy for the Devil) to be my CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT to date and I really want it to go perfectly....  And I think there's something missing still.  I want to really show the psychological wear and tear that this girl is going through... Because she eventually will go crazy and kill people and I need her to have a damn good motive.  I need her will to fail and I need her to be so completely exhausted that she'd do  anything  for emotional stability.  Grrrr.  Arrrrg.  *broods* So... yeah. And......... I want to draw more, but I can't because I've got artist's block too.  And I'm going CRAZY paranoid and FUCK there's still another hour and five minutes of this class and I DON'T WANT TO HANDLE THIS.  GOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD. So, maybe I'll just ramble for a little bit longer.  Don't expect me to be talking to you fools the entire period-- that'd make me CRAZY and I'm not that psycho yet. So. What should I have a one-sided conversation with this little blog about????  OH, I KNOW.  I'll practice talking about myself because I really suck at that.  That means that I need to go find a personality forward or something and post it in here because I can only do Q/A sessions.  You ask me to tell me what I think is important about my life and I will say "Green Day" and that's about it.  Which, you know.  Isn't all that I am, hopefully because... that'd be sad.  Even though if Green Day could mutate into the Christian God I could be a priest and live happily ever after because my life is devoted to those stupid band people anyways. Oh.  Something fun: I politely borrowed (stole) Jason's Reel Big Fish pin.  Yay! Right.  So, apparently I'm too lazy to actually go surf the internet for one of those things, and I'm too lazy-- Fish.  I had a dream about bushes and water and a house and it was KIND OF LIKE JUMANJI but... cooler.  And, tropical.  And mom... hmmm. I am thinking of a yeti and I haven't the faintest idea why.

      Okay.  Without further ado, I'm fucking pissed.  I have a nice little Rant Draft saved up in this blog about everything that is pissing me off right now, but this....  This is making me so fucking mad that it deserves its own post. So, my best friend, entitled: L.  She's cool and funny and all of that jazz and has perfectly horrible taste in guys.  I mean... the only semi-worthwhile guy she has ever dated didn't have any arms.  And normally, it doesn't bother me.  I mean, it DOES because the relationships always end up in tears and alcohol and stuff....  But.... THIS TIME BEATS EVERYTHING.  She's fallen in love with M, who is a lying, cheating FUCKBUCKET with a known history of being a PLAYER.  He ALSO has a kid, and an ex-girlfriend whom he visits constantly, and apparently has a say in his "relationship" with L. And, being a FRIEND that LOOKS OUT FOR HER (or at least tries my damndest) I talked to her about M and we DECIDED that he was a NO GOOD FUCKER and that me and Jason and Nick were going to KILL HIM and.... Then today.  I called her on her cell, because she sent me a crazy ballistic email about hating people....  And guess who she was with?  You guessed it: M.  They were talking and laughing like nothing had gone down between them which obviously was NOT THE FUCKING CASE and I wanted to fucking slap her. But she's never listened to me before.  Why should she start now?  I guess the thing that sucks most about it is how she deserves way better than him.  Why does summer bring out the drama in people?  I guess it's because there's no school to distract them....

        You Are Rin: You may be somewhat naive (and pretty energetic most of the time) but when it comes down to it, you would do a lot of things that other people wouldn't be able to. You're sometimes looked down upon as less than mature and your 'now, now, now' attitude, and you usually act on whims instead of thinking things out. But you're a fun person to have around, and there are a lot of people that care deeply for you.    urlLink   Which Female Inuyasha Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      There really should be some kind of law against this.  I keep trying to console myself by reminding myself that it's just a QUIZ how the HELL can a computerized quiz know the first (or second, for that matter) thing about me?  But every time I take one of these things it always calls me immature and naive.  I think... it's time to own up to the fact that I AM immature and I AM naive.  On the brighter side; fun to be around!  Huzzah!

      So I don't actually understand why people talk to me.  THEY are all wonderful, fantastic people and I am a shitheadded fuck-face.  No joke about it.  I'm a self-absorbed asshole that can't keep my fucking hands out of people's business.  I guess it's because I'm trying to help them or something, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I fuck things up and I should just not do that anymore.  People will be much better off if I stick to myself.  I mean, if these people WANT to tell me things or ask my advice fine that's great I really do like helping people but please, if you do?  Swear me to secrecy or something because I am, like I said, a fuck-face. *sigh*

      HOLY BEJEZZUS.&nbsp; Weird things have been happening, friends, and it bothers me.&nbsp; It wouldn't be so troublesome if my mind wasn't already on the fritz and all....&nbsp; May sunspots burn in the fiery pits of something nasty!   So, apparently we can now change font and font size.&nbsp; This is cool, but is also in a way very sad because it forces me to figure out what font looks best with my happy template.&nbsp; And once I figure out the font I will then need to decide what size it ought to be.&nbsp; And once I figure out the size it will look differently than I thought it did at first and will have to go through the whole huge problem all over again.&nbsp; This troubles me.    I am a troubled person.    I probably need medication, but the odds are really good that even if it was given to me I'd probably flush it down the toilet because-- hhf!&nbsp; I AM ME, neuroses included.&nbsp; I don't think I spelled that right.    Anyways.    Nothing much has been going on lately, and I know I have been neglecting my godgiven duties as a blogger-nerd and such....&nbsp; My traitorous mind thinks it has better things to do than talk to myself via a web-journal.    Hmm.    Whatever.    My friend Brittney is visiting from Boise now, that's cool.&nbsp; We went to the beach yesterday and went BOOGIE BOARDING although I suck and couldn't catch a good wave if my life depended on it.&nbsp; At any rate, I'm horribly out of shape and therefore am in a considerable amount of pain due to the strain put upon my muscles both attempting to boogie board and struggle against the current of the black-hearted sea.    I'm at the library.&nbsp; I don't quite understand whether that has anything to do with anything, but it seemed like a good thing to say, so I said it.    Nng.&nbsp; I'm hungry.&nbsp; Stupid diets.    Ummmm this is not fair, that the library's computer which has been molested by various grubby people is in better condition than my own, dear computer whom I lovingly call Baxter (because it-- he, whatever-- is a crazed psychopathic lunatic, and such things deserve names or a kick in the face).    Er, right.&nbsp; So I think I'm going to go lounge on a couch or something and do some sulking, because that sounds like it would be a fun thing to do.&nbsp; I drew some things that I want to post on DA but daddy stole my scanner (or took it back from the real thief or something) and so I can't use it because he scares me and I don't like going into his office with his TWO cool computers grrr.    Bye.
