      The day when i feel independant is not a long way off. i hope. What is like to be independent? God damn i want to know what it's like. I want a car, and i want money and i want to walk around knowing that i don't need anyone else to survive. Sometimes i feel like i want to try it, to just run away and see if i can survive on my own on the streets. But the smell of my mom cooking dinner always brings me back in, (plus the fact that i DON'T have a car and i DON'T have any money and i couldn't survive on my own, DUH). The other day, my dad let me drive his car about three feet down a long flat road in the dark. I coudv'e gone farther, but i was WAY to scared of getting busted by police because i didn't want to have to wait even longer for a car and I didn't want my insurance to go any farther up than it's going to be when im 16. I can't wait. My birthday's in 5 days, I'm gonna be 15, and i can't even believe it. But then i have to wait another 6 MONTHS before i can even start TRYING OUT to get my PERMIT, and then i have to wait another YEAR before i can get my LICENSE!!! It's like the end of the world, well not exactly. First I need income, some means of bringing in money to myself on a regular basis. And then transportation is next. The last time i was at sping lake there was a guy working there who was 14, and was thinking that i could just work there, then my parents say it's too far to drive everyday. Crap. Do i ride my bike? No, "it's not safe" says my mom. So there goes my money. WHAT THE HELL AM I GONNA DOOOO???????????????? i don't know. but why the hell am i asking you? Sometimes i find myself oddly excited but scared at the same time about the "real" world, the one we will all face after collage. I want to be able to call myself independent but then sometimes i do'nt know if i want all that responisibility. I want to be able to make money and have a car and have fun and stuff, then i look at the stats. Stats like how much gas costs and insurance for crying out loud!!

      So who am I? I don’t mean who I am as a person, I already know that. I’m Lucas Taylor Klein, I’m 15 years old and in 9th grade, I play tennis and guitar in my spare time and my favorite candy is Twix. That’s easy. But what I mean is who am I really. Who is me, on the inside? My brain, my soul, my mind, are they parts of me? Or is it my body and then my brain just comes along as an external device that my body created to do its thinking? Because if you think about just your mind, just what’s on the inside of it, what you think with and act with and are one with. But even as I say “you”, who is it? Who is it that thinks and decides and carries out the ideas that your mind gives you? Your eyes, the primary sense of recognition of the world. What person is looking out of those eyes and into the world, putting your soul in the life that fate chooses? Or does fate choose it? What is fate? Can you control fate? How do you know what your brain thinks when you see something and bring it within the vast walls of your unimportant, insignificant mind holding the covert key to the binding imagination of your past? If the journey of life and what it takes us through is in fact only a journey, what part of us goes on after death into that place that some people call heaven? Because when someone dies, we know that their body stays here, on earth, but without something controling it, there's no thought within it's head to tell the body what to do. There's nothing. If there is reincarnation, why can’t anybody remember anything before their entrance to the world and its mysteries? And if there isn’t reincarnation, where does the soul that was serving as a port for you mind go when the body it is carried in dies? Pinch yourself really hard on the arm. Who is feeling that pain? And why does the person who feels that pain feel it, and then in turn cast it off to the mind that has owns the body feeling the pain. And if “who” is a person, the who is the mind that goes with the person? What force of almighty power assigned each mind to its respective body? If someone died and came back to life as a different species,  would it be the same mind and attitude that they possessed as a human being? Now imagine all your hardships in life and the things that make you different from everybody else. Who do those qualities make you? “Who is that person who has the green hair and walks funny?”.      Me. I am the only one. The sacred one. The one who feels and sees and touches all. I am the one who chooses, who obeys I am the one to live, to make something of myself, and I must be the one who chooses my destiny for the mind that holds the body together. Out of all the people in the world, why was I the one to be chosen to witness the this planet? Out of all the people in the world, why was it me that I live from? Out of all the people in the world, why do I have the privilege to see through my own eyes and feel my own pain and experience my own difficulties and desires and pleasures? No one else can see it, no one else can taste it, no one else can touch it, no one else can smell it, no one else can see it, and no one else can hear it. Why was I the mind and soul and body and spirit to be the only one who can be? We cannot witness the world from someone else eyes, someone else’s body. You are stuck in the same one, but it is the only one. Nothing else exists. Only me.     (That was my Final Writer's Journal entry project thi9ng I did for Mrs. Brogan.)

      This is a quote from a speech by our president: "Our ememies are powerful and innovative, and so are we. They never stop thinking of new ways to harm our country and it's people... and neither do we." - George W. Bush.  I still can't get over why so many people in this country think this guy has the heart, brains, and lack of stupidity to be the most powerful man in the world. Because that's what he is, the most powerful man in the world; he commands the military of the richest, most powerful, most influentual country in the world. And he says things like that in public speeches. Do you think he actually knew what he was saying when he said that in his speech or do you think it's just because he talks like he didn't graduate from 8th grade? It's a hard question. Michael Moore thinks that Bush was involved in what happen on 9/11 and i think he's right. (Now there's a guy I wouldn't mind being president, Michael Moore). We trained and armed Saddam Hussein with biological weapons to help them fight their war with Iran. This is Butthole Senior, sorry I mean Bush Senior doing this. Then Osama Bin Laden attacks the U.S. leaving millions dead here. And just to see how many more innocent lives he can demolish for no reason, Bastard Junior, oh sorry i mean Bush Junior goes into Iraq bombing the whole country, looking for one guy, and trying to find some huge biological THAT HIS DAD PUT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE! Now, I know I'm radical for my cause, this looks like a really screwed up situation to me. Meanwhile, he's taking money away from the environment, schools, and all other things good in this country, and giving it to the military (like our military needs the help) for a war that was, is and will continue to be completely and totally unnecessary. Our country is going billions and billions of dollors into dept, gas prices are rocketing (and those ugly rich bastards in those ugly cars that are bigger than my house for crying out loud aren't helping at all, if you own a hummer, i have a sledge hammer in my garage that I will happily lend to you to help dispose of the huge pile of metal crap that you call a car) and it's harder for a teenager to get a job than the freakin' Depression of 1929! This guy is ruining the U.S. and he not fit to be president for another 4 years. REGISTER TO VOTE!!!!!!!!!!
