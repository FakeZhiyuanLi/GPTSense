      I must admit, at the bonfire that&nbsp;I hosted tonight I was quite exclusive in who was invited. I figured I would invite my beloved D. Squared and give him the perfect chance to spread his good name throughout our generation. However to my shock and surprise he outright declined my offer. He claimed he had to many important things to attend to, which begs the question "What is more important than the furthering of your DJ Persona?" This man no longer has his eyes on the prize, and hopefully getting away from the bogged down environment of Chaska will develop his creative genius even further in this newest adventure. I must say I was disappointed in his choice not to attend this evening and his rating in my mind has led him in a spiraling motion into second behind his own master PvD. However my love for D. Squared will not end so easily. I just hope that after his trip he will once again join up with his Chaska homies and enjoy the good ole days.

      This Saturday D. Squared will leave on an epic 14 day journey, first to San Diego and then secondly to Auburn. He plans to celebrate capitalism on the San Diego beaches while fondling the local Sea Lions. Maybe Sea Lions like Trance, D. Squared could DJ for them possibly? While at Auburn D. Squared plans to hang with his neo-capitilist friends. But hey, thats what you get for being libertarian. And this just in...... D. Squared has confirmed his sexuality, yes he is indeed straight. I'm sorry Super Honky, but you can't have him.

      We've come to ponder many a times whether D. Squared is hetero or homo. There are many signs that point in both directions. He once descibed what the beloved PvD was wearing at a concert by this, "His outfit was fabulous yet simple, as usual for the master of fashion." Ok Queer Eye, a little creepy. Another thing he commented on Pvd went like this, "About three minutes after Paul took the stage, Jessica turned to me and said "he is so good looking." Duh. When he looked up at the crowd for the first time, I swear he smiled right at me." HOOOOOOMO, HOOOOOOOOMO. C'mon D. Squared, you can do better then that. For some reason his friends at Gonzaga thought he would score with 15 ladies in his freshman year of college. Please, we saw the women he was hanging out with. D. Squared, don't let your devilish good looks go to waste. But apparently that Jessica girl was his girlfriend. Hmm, maybe D. Squared his bi-sexual. Screw that, he should take up a new love for......animals.

      Some of the people who now know of the divine being known in the underground trance world as "DJ D. Squared" have all sat awake at night, all wondering the answer to the same question. Just who is D. Squared, and when and where can I hear some of his music? Well my esteemed colleagues and I have wondered these things ourselves. Although we have heard hour's of D. Squared's trance sets, these are but teases of what his DJ mastery holds in store for the future. I will now be the first to demand more out of D. Squared. I demand that he makes a public appearance, and to add more, that it be a full out trance rave. Chaska Minnesota has never seen the likes of a well known Trance DJ entrepreneur as D. Squared. And it is about time that the public should recognize his mastery of all things electronic. Thus I myself shall proclaim that myself and the co-founders of this site will in the future be in contact with D. Squared in order to get him to hold a concert in order to spread his godlike image throughout more young impressionable trance addicts like ourselves. So to all those who this message reaches please contact us by posting comments to this BLOG about your interest in making our dream of a D. Squared extravaganza a reality. We need all of our D. Squared superfans to unite under one banner regardless of race or gender or musical taste and agree to love the wonderful music played by D. Squared.

      The former home of the King of Rock N' Roll is now the current home of the King of Trance/Prog./hardhouse/electronica.  DJ D.Squared bought the much celebrated property after his sophmore album, "Intergalactic Euphoria", went multi-platinum in 49 countries, staying at No. 1 for a record-breaking 67 weeks in Venezuela.  Upon moving in, DJ D.Squared was quoted as saying that "The D to the Squared ain't never gonna stop preachin' to the people."  Three days later, he filed for bankruptcy.

      After reading our blog, D. Squared became infatuated with our sophisticated witty humour. He just couldn't handle it. He was even kind enough to write  urlLink about us  on Grooves on a Vinyl. What a Playa.

      I just got done listening to D. Squared's hour long set, Just A Touch of Techno. It was alright. For some reason in the beginning some lady kept yelling something about how the revolution will not be on the radio. I dunno what revolution she was talking about, I must ask D. Squared about this. Then for what seems like 40 minutes (probably shorter then that) D. Squared is just pumping the same drum/bass beat (I think it's drums and bass) into you. It changes a little bit in between, then go backs to it. Once in a while some guys says "I know you want me." Man, what a ride D. Squared takes you on. Amen Brutha, Amen.

      In case you were wondering about this websites layout, we decided that this would best fit D. Squared. The neon lights and all would definitely suit his raves that he plays at and attends. Tacky they may seem, but perfect for full blown trance addicts like Mr. D. Squared himself.

      DJ D.Squared is raw, unadulterated talent.  To all you naysayers who claim that trance isn't real music, I only have three words for you:  Paul Van Dyk.  Mastery and skill flow through DJ D.squared like blood would flow through a mortal.  but DJ D.Squared is no mere mortal.  His trance music doesn't just justify mankind's very existence, but it takes it to a higher plane.  Long live DJ D.Squared.
