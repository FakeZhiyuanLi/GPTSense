						   So guess what procrastination cost me this week.  Almost $400, two days of work and another test of my wife's patience.  You see, a few months back, I got pulled over in the '84 Grand Marquis (heretofore known as the Clunker) for something to do with the inspection sticker. I forgot, when I registered the car in October to have it inspected. The hyper-aware policeman that was protecting the streets of Andover that day, noticed that the sticker didn't match...something. End result: I got pulled over, told to get the car inspected and given a $25.00 ticket for not wearing my seatbelt.  So I got the car inspected a week later (it failed) and was supposed to do something about it by the middle of May. Those of you who have an idea of the crazy schedule I have, know how easy it would be for me to forget to get the car fixed and pay the seatbelt citation.  This past Monday, I got pulled over for the inspection sticker, was informed that my license had been suspended and the Clunker was towed away. If the best you can say about anything that happens to you before 8 o'clock is "Well, at least I didn't get arrested." then your life needs some serious re-assessment.  It is Friday and I have paid the citation, gotten my license reinstated and retrieved the Clunker from the impound yard.   There is no doubt that my life is in need of some serious re-assessment. I have no time, though. Between commuting to and from both jobs, all to frequent doctor appointments and quality time with the kids, I barely have time to commute to both jobs, go to doctor appointments or spend time with the kids.  Remind me again why the body requires sleep.

						   So this is a blog.  I have heard so much about people writing these things and wondered "Why?". Has the internet made us all into such self-centered fools that we actually believe people are going to be interested enough in our lives to check a website every few days just to read what we think or see what we've been up to?  Well, it appears so. It also appears to have taken hold of me too. I'll admit that I have no real plan as to what I might be posting. I see a lot of movies. Maybe some movie reviews. Maybe some rants about politics or current events.  I guess we'll all be surprised. In any event, drop me a note and give me some feedback. I'm not sure what the feedback will actually do for me or the 'quality' of this blog, but it will be nice to hear from folks now and then.
