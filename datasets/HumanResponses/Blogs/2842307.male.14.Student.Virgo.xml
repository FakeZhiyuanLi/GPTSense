      Just came back from RME retreat at FMM house of prayer about 5 hours ago. It was very enlightening, especially the speeches made by Redemtrist Brother Nelville who's going to be ordained next year and also by a guy named Christian. I don't know about the rest but I do know that I managed to learn quite an amount during this retreat. Sigh, wish it was longer. Anyway, I got to go now. See you all soon!

      Well, hello to everyone. YESSSS!!! I'm sooo happy. The exams are finally over and I managed to get a spot of cycling done. What am I going to do now? I dunno, maybe when I go back to school on Monday I might print the final year exam papers to prepare myself. Besides that, I'm going to play some games. Well, with all that said, I'm going to stop here. Good day to everyone. Looking forward to Sunday's Cathechism class, so fun!

      Just came back from cathechism class. I'm so happy because it's just 2 more days, that's right, 2 more days before my exams are over. After that I'll be letting loose and be able to cycle in more than half a year. Until then, I got to go and study more. Good Day to everyone.

      Hello!       It's been a rather busy day today and will continue all the way up till Renaissance where all our hard work will pay off. Just had an interview with 2 teachers today. Well, what can I say. It was fun. All I just hope now is that the interview is okay. Well guess what, I told them I wanted to be an RO. While my heart yearns to want to be an RO so that I can help the Sec 1's better, I somehow feel attracted to the QM post. Maybe it's just because my section has plenty of QM's before. Or maybe it's what I really want.        Wierd thing is, all these times I've played with the band for the school's morning assembly on Mondays, I've never once regretted it. While non-bandsmen may say that we're bloody fools to waste our time there, I feel that it's worthwhile doing.        Heh heh, Cathechism class starting again this Sunday. While my classmates feel that it's a waste of time, I find it a time when we can bond together. Just like the saying goes, "You'll never notice it until it's gone", so do I feel that way. The others will never miss it until we are all confirmed and there's no more classes.        What does all this means? Well, it certainly shows that I have a different outlook than others. Well, that's it. I'm calling it a night. Good or bad? Hard to say. Haha.

      They say that one day, there was a blind man sitting on the steps of a building with a hat by his feet and a sign that read: "I am blind,please help".  A creative publicist was walking by him and stopped to observe. The blind man only had a few coins in his hat, he dropped a few more coins in his hat and without asking for his permission took the sign, turned it around, and wrote another announcement. He placed the sign by his feet and left.  That afternoon the creative publicist returned by the blind man and noticed that his hat was full of bills and coins. The blind man recognized his footsteps and asked if it was him who had re-written his sign and he wanted to know what did he write on it? The publicist responded: Nothing that was not true, I just rewrote your sign differently". He smiled and went on his way.  The blind man never knew, but his new sign read : "TODAY IS SPRING AND I CANNOT SEE IT ".  Change your strategy when something does not go your way and you'll see it will probably be for the best. Have faith that every change is best for our lives. Put your heart, mind, intellect and soul even to your smallest acts. This is the secret of success.   God Bless!!!

      YOU ARE A SUCCESS...  WHEN you clearly understand that failure is an event, not a person - that yesterday ended last night, and today is a brand new day.  WHEN you know that a success (a win) doesn't make you and that a failure (a loss) doesn't break you.    WHEN you have made friends with your past, are focused on the  present, and are optimistic about your future.  WHEN you are filled with faith, hope, and love and live without  anger, greed, guilt, envy, or thoughts of revenge.  WHEN you are mature enough to delay gratification and shift your  focus from your rights to your responsibilities.   WHEN you know that failure to stand for what is morally right is the prelude to becoming a victim of what is criminally wrong.  YOU ARE A SUCCESS...  WHEN you are secure in who you are, so you are at peace with your  Creator and in fellowship with others.   WHEN you have made friends of your adversaries and have gained  the love and respect of those who know you best.   WHEN you understand that others can give you pleasure but that  genuine happiness comes when you do things for others.   WHEN you give hope to the hopeless, love to the unlovable, and  are pleasant to the grouch, courteous to the rude, and generous to the needy.   WHEN you can look back in forgiveness, forward in hope, down in  compassion, and up with gratitude.   WHEN you know that the greatest are those who choose to be servants of all.    WHEN you recognise, confess, develop, and use your given physical, mental, and spiritual abilities for the benefit of others.  YOU ARE A SUCCESS when you know that you have been a good and  faithful servant of the Creator of the universe.

      Well, good afternoon to those few people who actually visit this blog. As the school holidays draws to a close, I cannot help but ponder why as we grow older, time seems to tick away faster. It seems to me that a single day passes in a flash. Sometimes, I just wish that I could turn back the clock and undo certain things but I know that is not possible. Therefore, I am committed to looking ahead and preparing for the future instead of dwelling on the past. That's all. Have a nice day!

           Well, hello to everyone. I've been pretty busy lately, what with all my CCA commitments and other stuff. Oh, and I managed to survive yesterday's music exchange at Chua Chu Kang Secondary School. I actually did not screw up my solo. I was so nervous that I actually skipped lunch just to practice the solo to convince myself that I could do it.      It went off without a glitch and here I am for once actually being proud of myself. Oh, and the other school there were Anderson, Bedok North, Regent and of course Chua Chu Kang. All secondary schools of course.      Right now, there is another big thing coming up and it's Renaissance. I will have to play my solo for two nights in a row and pray that nothing goes wrong.      Yesterday night, I cancelled the Legion outing for Our Lady Ark of the Covenant(AOC) Praesidium that's supposed to occur today as there were too few people going. It will be resheduled at a later date.      Well, that's all I've got to say and I hope I can say more the next time. See you all soon!

      It's been a great day for me today. I've passed my first major Chinese test for the first time in three years. However, that does not give me a cause to celebrate as it's just the begginning. Got plenty of things to come in the near future.   I will succeed if I work hard...  Even if I do fail, I will pick myself up and strive for better results. All these will come inevitably.

      It is Thursday, a day before Renaissance. I have no idea how I am going to study for the three tests tomorrow but yet find rest at the same time. But whatever the case is, I will succeed.  Tomorrow, I will awe the audience...  Tomorrow, I will get my section to bond closer and be more responsible...

      1) THE GIFT OF LISTENING...  But you must REALLY listen.  No interrupting, no daydreaming,  no planning your response.  Just listening.      2) THE GIFT OF AFFECTION...  Be generous with appropriate hugs,  kisses, pats on the back and handholds.  Let these small actions demonstrate the  love you have for family and friends.      3) THE GIFT OF LAUGHTER...  Clip cartoons.  Share articles and funny stories.  Your gift will say, "I love to laugh with you."      4) THE GIFT OF A WRITTEN NOTE...  It can be a simple  "Thanks for the help" note or a full sonnet.  A brief, handwritten note may be remembered for  a lifetime, and may even change a life.      5) THE GIFT OF A COMPLIMENT...  A simple and sincere,  "You look great in red," "You did a super job"  or "That was a wonderful meal"  can make someone's day.      6) THE GIFT OF A FAVOUR...  Every day, go out of your way  to do something kind.      7) THE GIFT OF SOLITUDE...  There are times when we want nothing better  than to be left alone.  Be sensitive to those times and give the gift of  solitude to others.      8) THE GIFT OF A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION...  The easiest way to feel good is  to extend a kind word to someone,  really it's not that hard to say,  Hello or Thank You.   GOD BLESS!!!

      It's Monday, just four days before Renaissance. My confidence has been boosted by the unexpected music exchange today. My solo can be and will be fine if I just relax, which I managed today.  Four more days....  My time will come to shine....

      Redefine the word "fail". There is no failure in life other than not trying. If you want something badly enough, make an attempt. If you want to paint, get a brush and do it. If you want to sing, sing. A lot of people get scared, they're afraid to fail. Take that word out of your vocabulary. You don't "fail", you just haven't put in enough effort.

      Time flies so very fast. In a day's time, the Sec. 3's will have taken over from the Sec. 4's and we will be the most senior batch. Life is cruel, it doesn't allow time for silly mistakes.  We, the new batch of leaders, will have to watch our every movement from now on. So many watchful eyes, no space to make a small mistake and get sent out of class.  We got to lead by example. . .  Even though we will have to sacrifice a lot, we will do it not only for our own sake, but for the sake of the rest of our juniors.  We will uphold our morales and be the ideal SJI Military Bandsman, one who knows his limits. One who has fierce loyalty to his close friends and to the Band. One who is trustworthy and honest.
