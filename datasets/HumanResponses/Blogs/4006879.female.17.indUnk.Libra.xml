        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I suppose you're probably wondering what the title of this entry means. What is Mary anticipating? Her wedding? Her next shopping spree? Her period? Well. I could answer yes to all of those, but the truth is, my friends, that I'm not really anticipating anything in specific. It was just the first word that popped into my head. Yes, it's random. I know. I sympathize. Lets see, Last time I wrote in this journal, the title was: "The Ball Is Over..". Yes well, it recently came to my attention that I didnt actually finish that thought, as i should have. I never even mentioned the ball, isnt that ironic? Speaking of irony, a muggle singer's album's just come out on wizarding media. Alanis Morisette. I love her music and you should too. Go fork out a couple of galleons and buy it. If you dont, I will send my Parker after you and he will kill you... ::gets lost:: I had a point to this... oh yes. The Ball. Well, of course, being Mary Jane Thorne, it wasnt difficult finding a date. A quiet boy names Julian Gotti agreed to go with me, after I shared my knowledge of ball dancing with him in the courtyards and Parker threw a fit about something.. I cant remember anymore. Oh yes, I rememebr now. He let me know that I was to marry him after he graduates. I have a good year and a half as a single woman until I marry him and forced to because an adulterer. I wouldnt want to partake in adultery.. but you cant expect me to stay faithful to that little brat, can you? I'll cheat on him every night, even if its just to spite him. I'm still young and I have the right to screw around. Alright, so I'm going to the ball and Julian doesnt make it. I went as Anne Boleyn (naturally) and Parker went as Henry the VIII (coincidentally). We went in together... but not as a couple of course. He was with Tallulah, but she got her knickers in a twist and ran off with Ginny and ended up being tortured. But I'll get to that later. We were entertained by a couple of imposters... they fancied it funny to dress as parker and myself. It was entertaining, what can you expect? When you're the Queen of the court, you have a couple of royal fools and they cant be blamed for what they say. They're fools. Keyword:Fool. Yep. Moving on, I wasnt with Parker long. Moros decided to (thankfully) take me away from dear Parker to dance. I was actually in a good mood with Parker, any other time Moros would've been helpfuly by taking me away, it was a shame to waste a rare happy time with Parker, but hew as distracted. Wanted to find his little girlfriend or something. Moros was plenty to keep my attention for a while, wonderful dancer. Unfourtunately, he ran off all unexpectedly. Dissapointing it was, I was having a nice time too. He had to go save Ginny and tallulah or whatever. I went out, sat with Heidi for a bit.. then left. Anti climactic really. The only good part was the death eater attack. ginny got the guy's name carved into her arm. She'll be fine though, the little alcoholic was durnk all through it. She probably doesnt even remember it fully. Alright.. off to bed. I feel I've spoken too much but you know how i have the need to write specific things and incidents.. luckily&nbsp; I didnt get too specific in this entry.. but one day I may just surprise you and drone on and on and on..

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alright. I've decided to start writing in a journal, at the prompting of my Ginny. And anyone who happens to come across this journal and reads it, I hope you'll enjoy learning&nbsp;of my delusions of grandeur.But be warned, once you open up, you'll never be able to close it because I am much to interesting to be boring. I'm like a novel. Now I just have to decide what to write about.. *crickets chirp* I could write about Ginny...Heidi..Parker.. Me. Yes I know I should write about Me becaue Me is the most sought after person ever. EVER. And when I refer to Me, I mean me. I am me, the great and powerful... Mary Jane Thorne. *tries to start another paragraph, unsuccesfully* What the fuck I want another paragraph now you insolent little journal will bow to my command and make a new paragraph, indenting an all!. *tries agin* Fuck. Ok, moving on, I'd better warn you, dear followers-er.. readers, that its doubtful that I will post regularly. Not only doubtful but highly doubtful. Hey shut your mouth and stop complaining you're lucky you're even getting this much and you should go kiss Ginny's feet for making me make this. But remember, no matter how much you kiss her feet, I'm the one sitting in the backgroud running the show. She's my masque (yes I used que instead of K because I speak French and i'll Frencherize anything I want.) all I needed was a sweet face and a nice personality and sono i shall take over Durmstrang. I will have servants. You will refer to me as the The Great Thorne, and if anyone decides to make a play on that name and turn it into The Great Thorne In My Ass, I will personally have your heads on a spike. You'll all be anne Boleyn and every other person whos ever been beheaded. And I wont use an axe, I'll use a guillotine because i speak french and I'm trying to frencherize, as I've mentioned. wow, I got off topic. Ha ha you'll never ever know what I was really going to say. HAAHAA!! I feel so sorry for you, you must really be in suspense now. Well screw you, or in French... suck mah balls.&nbsp;
