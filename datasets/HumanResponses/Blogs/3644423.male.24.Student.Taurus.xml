      has any ever thought why people have expectation...when they know that if their expectations dont come true there is going to be sorrow, because of sorrow one can get angry and distrubed in life, when one is angry...the person will not be in a position to think properly, may take hastey decisions, which may prove very costly, and even may bring his down fall...!! so why people have lot of expectations...? cant we just do our duty and not worry about the results...coz i believe, what ever has to happen will happen, what we can do is just do our best. i dont know if all will agree with me...?!!!

      has any one thought about the important of friendship....? i used to take it just as any other thing...but some people really change it all. one should be lucky enough to get a real good friend. if u have a ONE real good friend...then i believe u r the most luckyest person on earth. for me friends are more than any thing. its a treasure...and very few see it that way i believe..?!! but i dont know if every one will agree with me on this matter..!! each one has his  her view on this matter. but i like to say that iam very lucky to have a very good friend with me. i dont know what i would be if that friend was not there...?!!
