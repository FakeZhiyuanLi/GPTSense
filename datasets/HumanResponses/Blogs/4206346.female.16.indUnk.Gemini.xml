      Amazingly better than you'd think. The incense, that is. John's almost done gutting his room. Removing his entire existence from the household. It's really rather depressing. I came home from work today to find a pile of stuff on my bed that he had borrowed over the years. Yoga books, green nail polish, and this lovely incense were among them. I just lit some... it's almost nauseating if it weren't for the headache it gives you. But it's a good headache... if that makes any sense at all.  This incense is making me dumber. That explains a lot about John... considering he used about 10 sticks of it. But that was back in his pot days.  Haha. Back.  I joined Girl Scouts. I amaze myself sometimes. But hey, we get to go to Europe next summer, so that's pretty cool.  Hopefully I can go visit David over winter break. That'd be so tight.  And hopefully Alli can still come out to visit me. That really needs to happen.  Peace out.

      I have hope!! I just remembered that today at work I asked Shawn if he'd be my freshman bitch this year. He said that Owen already called dibs on him, but that will all soon be changed *devilish grin* BUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  There is hope for my junior year of high school! And it comes in the form of SHAWN!

      Okay, I'm seriously freaking out right now because it is just hitting me that ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GONE OR WILL BE SOON. NACHO I NEED YOU TO BE HERE  NOW ! Spinach is leaving TODAY. And it is seriously making me so depressed. Soon Johnjohn will be gone, too. There's like my two best friends in Truckee BAM gone. My only consolation is that Stoof has my email and promised to email me ASAP and Lauren offered up her dorm room to me if I ever wanna go down to UNLV to visit my brother. Oh Johnny-poo. If only you knew how much I love you and how much I look up to you and how much I want to be exactly like you. I miss you already!!!! With John and Stefanie gone, I seriously don't know what to do. David is in Washington. My pookie is in Minnesota. COME VISIT ME! I NEED YOU!!!! Nick and Jilly Bean are in Reno.  There's not anyone here in Truckee for me. Sheldon's cool, but we don't really hang out that much. And as glad as I am that Cassie and I are becoming friends again, it's just not the same. Everything feels so forced. Like tonight was cool and all... you coming over like back in the old days. But it just wasn't the same. I almost died when Alex called your cell phone.  I just realized why I dislike Cassie so much. She is everything that I wish my life could be. People call her all the time. She has an endless source of friendships to fall back on. I know that sounds totally bitchy to just have a gazillion friends that aren't all very close, but all the same, I'm jealous. Like Brynn's party tonight. You were invited. ALEX was invited. Was I? No. Wicks was there. He was supposed to call me. Never did. I bet anything that Sheldon was there. Did he call me? No. Stefanie called me earlier to hang out, but when I wasn't there, she took John instead. But now she's gone anyways. So I guess that doesn't really matter too much. Your life is so perfect and all you can do is bitch about it. But I guess there are probably a few people looking at my life that are jealous. I couldn't tell you any, but it's possible that they're out there. Though I doubt it.  I try to be so easy going. Just go with the flow. Do what comes naturally. Don't force anything. (Kinda sounds like good advice for sex, but I apply it to life instead.) I guess we all just have our low points.  GODDAMNIT I JUST WANT TO HAVE A LIFE FOR ONCE AND NOT FEEL SO SORRY FOR MYSELF!  Is it really so much to ask?  So, here I am, on a Saturday night, sitting alone in my room on the verge of tears.  Another fruitful evening in the life of me.

      I wish I had a more interesting blog. One that everyone would want to read. And when I say everyone, I mean EVERYONE. Oh woe is me, for I lead a humble, maybe boring life. Plus people love to talk about themselves (hence online journals and blogs), but don't really like to read about other people. Oh well.  On the phone with Nacho. Great times.  OMG YOU HAVE TO WATCH:  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/schfiftyfive.html  Just go there. Trust me.  WHAT YOU SAY?! Schfifty five! My IQ is schfifty five!  No, it really isn't though. I have no idea what my IQ is. At least 100. Or at least one would hope.  Whoah sorry, I got distracted by THIS:  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/endofworld.html  Whoever made that website should pay me for advertising it. Haha. I wish.  ANAY-hoo. Ew I squished a bug! I was wondering what that was when I picked it up... I swear I was going to say something.  Oh yah! I finished separating my dreads for the bazillionth time. They're beautiful. But I had to put rubberbands around each one to keep them apart because they were being bad and trying to be conformists. NO DAMNIT! YOU NEED TO LEARN TO BE INDIVIDUALS. Silly bastards.  Jesus I love how I talk about my dreadlocks like they have personalities. Earlier today right after I jacked them off and twist and ripped em, they were chillin to jazz music. And they LOVE the scarf that Spinach gave them. I just hope my mom didn't hear us talking about yesterday. Stoof totally cut the back of Z's neck while giving him a haircut. Let that be a lesson to all not to give people hair cuts while under the influence. Of anything. Even your little sister. Haha the poltergeist got SO pissed when Stoof told her that Jesus was a hippie. I love it. Heh heh heh heh.  So my dreads are chillin in a bun in a scarf. And they're lovin it. I should really wash them soon. I just wash me in general. I don't smell or anything, but it's been awhile. At least i use deodorant. Unlike Joe. Fuckin hippie. NEVER TRUST A HIPP-AY! Wait. That's saying never trust me or Stoof. Eh. Probably good advice in the long run.  Wow. I digress a LOT. But that's okay. Probably the first step in having a blog that everyone likes.  And I mean everyone.  Peace out.

      Okay, this is just so creepy (or at least I thought it was) that I had to share it with you.  I wanted to know how many other members on this blog server listed "Star Trek: The Voyage Home" as one of their favourite movies. 3 out of the 4 people (including myself) were Geminis. I usually don't believe in that zodiac stuff, but it was cool.  Anyways... yah just thought that was kinda cool.

      What a day. Walked down to Stoof's around 11:00. Gave her back her skirt and her graduation present (the do's and don't's of underwear). Jessie came over... did some... stuff... made some... "smoothies"... Sheldon and Z came over and drove us down to the river. Pretty cool until Jessie got hella sick. Poor girl. She needs to lay off a little bit. At least I got to see Sheldon and JOE came. I was happy. Anyways... came back, ate some angel food cake and tried calling Cassie again. Then... I went to her house. Drove myself. I was so proud. We talked for awhile... I think we're on our way back on track. Hopefully. I watched her make angel food cake (I gave her the craving) and then I illegally drove us down to the video store to get "Rocky Horror Picture Show". Awesome movie, though I didn't get to finish it because it got to be like 9:00 and I didn't want my mumsie to worry.  Rocky Horror Picture Show is definitely one of the COOLEST, yet DISTURBING movies I've ever seen. It's wonderful. Tim Curry is God. I need to watch it a ton and learn all the songs and the dancing for when I go to visit Spinach up in Humbolt. She said there are mad festivals about it on Halloween and Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna go up to see her around then. Sheldon's gonna drive me, he just doesn't know it yet. He can drive for Halloween and I'll drive for Valentine's Day. Because I can actually drive people legally on February 12th. 6 months to the day.  Anyways, I'm sittin here listening to Mischke and I'm exhausted from the day. Kinda glad I didn't go to Brynn's birthday bash, because I know it would be totally out of hand.  Bitter Bomber's Better.  Peace out.

      Dude this thing is being really retarded. My blog that is. Why won't you display all of my posts!? You're only doing my first two and not the last three!!! Jesus. I believe a spanking is in order. Or maybe a bitchslap. NO!  A backhand. Yeah buddy. (thanks to Megan for that annoyingly addicting phrase)  So, if you go to my blog, and it's only displaying the first two posts, press refresh on your toolbar. Wait. If it's only showing you two... then you won't be reading this...  Damnit.  Okay, if you're reading this, none of that applies to you. If you're NOT reading this, then press refresh. There. Problem solved.   News of the day:  I have my driver's license!!! Woo hoo!!! I got 10 errors... but I still passed, right?  Music of the day:  Steriogram "Schmack"   Plan of the day:  Going to Ame's Deli to visit Megan and calling my hobbit.  OH! And if any of you lovely people reading this are currently in the Truckee, California area, go to Madigan's Grille &amp; Tavern on August 31. Richner, Womack, and some other cop are going to be the waiting staff that night and all the tips they get go towards supporting Girl Scout troop 434 and their trip to Europe. So go and laugh at Richner for all those times he caught you ditching school. Make sure to send your meal back AT LEAST 7 times because it's too cold or you think he hocked a loogey in it. AND TIP BIG!! Because the cops don't get it! HA!! Fuckin' cops.  Oh and by the way Blogger, please start including comments in my posts. Because you tell me that I have two comments on "I wish I had an apple so I could bash it into your face.", but there's only one displayed.  Stop being a little bitch and do your job!

      I think I'm just making this even worse. I think I want to be mad at Cassie and I can't even imagine how she could ever be my friend again, so I'm just pushing her away. I refuse to believe that she's making an effort or that she's comprehended any-fucking-thing I've actually said.     Nacho: So.. what'cha thinking?  Me: Why she's doing this. Why this all had to happen. How the hell she got herself into this. And how the hell is she gonna get herself out, because I'm sure as hell not cooperating very much.     I'm too tired for this. I have a test to take in 9 and a half hours.

      When I told you that you would have to gain back my trust, blocking me wasn't exactly what I had in mind.  I'm glad that Bryce is helping you through this troublesome time in your life. Because being a bitch can be so emotional sometimes.

      Cassie's away message: "Your heart won't heal right if you keep tearing out the sutures..."  You would know, wouldn't you... You keep tearing out mine.

      What do you do when your best friend is a bitch? Say you have this friend. You guys have been pratically attached at the hip for two years. You share everything with each other. She's like the sister you've never had but always wanted. She's awesome. So, say one day, this person starts to ignore you. She listens, but you can tell that she really could care less. She's only your friend when it's convienent for her, and when you're having serious problems, she just adds to them by ditching you for "cooler" people. When you try to ask what happened, she just acts like nothing has happened and acts surprised that you think she's acting like this.   *sigh*  Here are some things I wanted to say to you last night: (" what you said ": what i wanted to say)    " I'm fucking pissed at him right now because he is so giving me double messages and I don't even know what to think. ": How does it feel? To have someone that you love pretend to reciprocate the feeling, then be a total dick to you? So now you know. Why didn't you believe me? You pretended to be supportive, to care, but you didn't. Not at all. And it's happening to you. I'm almost glad. You bitch, you're finally getting what's coming to you. Good.  " I think I have the right to still be his friend and yet tell him that he's being a dick to you .": Yah, right, like you even care. You don't care how he treats me. Not one bit.  " I'm a hippocrite .": And a bad speller.  " I struggle to remember what it feels like to be your friend .": Maybe you're struggling because you never really were my friend. Maybe you never really did care, and I'm just now noticing.  " I can't communicate that online .": Um... you just did.  " Yes, I think I have changed quite a bit. A lot of my changing went on when we weren't together, as in I was ignoring you or too busy or whatever .": So you changed. You changed when you were "busy". You ignored me while you were changing, and now that you've decided to try and know me again, I'm just supposed to sit here and accept not only that you totally ignored me, but that now I have to go on like nothing ever happened? It's not fair. You don't get to do that. You don't get to put me through that.  " I just think that our friendship deserves a place in any life I have because I value it. A lot .": If you value it so damn much, then why did you throw it away like it was nothing?  " Thank you, Greta, for being my friend .": Don't you dare thank me. I don't want recognition. I want my friendship back. I want and apology. I want you to actually make an effort for once in your fucking life.  " Fuckin' a. I really do deserve to go to hell .": Don't give yourself so much credit. Yah, you cut me deep and ripped out my soul, but you're not responsible for everything. And do you really think that I want you to tell me what a bad person you are? I know what a bad person you are. To apologize is human; to forgive is divine. Or something like that. Anyways, fuck you, it's gonna take time for you to be my friend again. I'm only human. I want you back, but thanks to you and Alex, I have major trust and closeness problems, so it's gonna take time.  " Is there anything else you should throw at me now? ": I'm not throwing anything. I'm telling the truth. I'm showing you what a bitch you've been. Don't pretend to be my friend. You don't mean it.  " And don't feel bad, please .": Don't tell me how to feel.  " I miss you, just so you know that .": Really? Funny, doesn't show.   I feel like I do everything for our relationship, but now I've lost faith. I've lost faith in you, and you've demolished my trust. So why don't you do something for once? Why don't you pick up the pieces and try to make sense of them, instead of just shoving them under the rug? I don't expect you to change. I just kind of hoped that you might care enough about our friendship to make an effort.  Excuse me, I have to scream.  *Jeopardy theme music* Ahhhh, much better.   Thank you, David. For loving me and sticking up for me when no one else would. Thank you, Allison. For being proud of me and giving me the courage to find myself and just be that. I love you guys so much. I could never ask for better friends.

      Damn. Well, I HAD just written a bit of my first blog, but then my computer decided it'd had enough of being nice to me for one day and randomly shut down. I think it might be PMSing.  As I had originally typed though- I have a blog! I wonder who came up with that term anyways? Blog. Sounds like something you do when you've had a little too much to drink...  Anywho. I take my driver's test tomorrow. I'm super nervous. I'm not a horrible driver, but I'm not a wonderful one, either. It should be okay, though. As long as they don't disqualify me for having a crack in my windshield. I mean, insurance doesn't even cover the cost of replacing a windshield if the crack is less than the size of a quarter. Too bad mine's the size of Rhode Island.  I wonder why people always reference size to Rhode Island? Maybe because it's so versitile. Think about it: if you're talking about something small, you can say that it's as small as Rhode Island because it's such a small state. But, if you're talking about something big, you can say it's as big as Rhode Island because it's a state as compared to maybe a house or something like that. Cool.  Well I've already got things to write about for my next blog (can't write about them here because it's such an unrelated and major topic for me). So, this is.. me. ....Signing off?
