      Not&nbsp;feeling too great at the moment. I'm not exactly sure why. Ever get that heavy feeling in your chest? As though something is pulling down on your heart, making it feel heavy as stone? It's weird how it just kinda hit me. I dunno, whatever. Tomoro I have to wake up early, goto the dentist, then go straight to work. It'll be a blah day to say the least but then again the past couple of days have been blah days I suppose so whatever. I'm just looking forward to this week to be over with already! This coming weekend and the next week should be much much better.&nbsp; And then the week&nbsp;after that I leave for Paris! So yea that's gunna be good. Listening to the song "Pig" by DMB (of course), makes me feel a bit better. It's great how a single song can change your entire mood in a matter of minutes.      Don't burn the day away

       Listened to this and it brought me to tears, so beautiful, touches that certain place in my heart and mind which brings out these deep emotions. Don't know why, but the music just has that effect on me. So  beautiful ...

       The most intense display of emotions I've&nbsp;ever heard in a song before. Dave wrote this song after asking his longtime girlfriend to marry him 3 times&nbsp;and she turned him down all 3 times.&nbsp; This set of lyrics is from a live show at "The Gorge" (2002), the best live performance of the song ever recorded.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Yea, well just got home a lil while ago from Megs. Nothing all that exciting I guess. Had a drink but thats bout it. I'd rather get trashed with people I actually enjoy hanging out with, not kids such as Jian(fuckhead)Carlo and others, so I'm not disappointed. Max and Meg had their daily "i-wanna-hook-up-with-you-but-dont-wanna-date-you" talks where meg ends up crying her eyes out, and ohyea she was trashed at that point so it was even worse. Oh yea and then she decides to tell Max that she's given head to her neighbor (who is COMPLETE white TRASH) twice and shes only known him a week. it's like, "WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with ya!" cmon have some respect for the ones you love. She needs to grow up and stop being a bitch like that and Max needs to learn to stay away from her for a while until things cool down. He just keeps hurting both her and himself when he sees her again and does the things he does. I suppose one day he'll learn but whatever, thats his deal. And can i just say i really fucking HATE Jian-Carlo? He's such a goddamn cocky narcisistic asshole. I'm not even gunna get into why, but we'll just leave it at the fact that,yes,he is. Okay well that ends this rant. I feel a bit better now! =P

      Yea, so i woke up at 1:00 today! woohoo! I can't say there's anything better than waking up, looking at the clock, and realizing you just slept for like 12 freaking hours. heh. although part of me is like, "wow you idiot, you just threw away half your day!" *SMACK!* but hey, it's all good cause I have no big plans for today anyway. Meg Walsh, Max's ex-gf is having a party cause she has an empty house till tomoro (her parents went away), and some kids will be bringing some "beverages" (vodka, coconut rum, bacardi raz/cranberry juice, beer!) but I prolly won't be drinking seeing as I can't sleep over since I have work in the morning/I have to drive. Meh, it might be entertaining nonetheless, Max and I will prolly stop by for a lil bit in any case. Seems like most everybody I wanna hang out with is going away this coming week. GRRR. And then there's the  certain people  I almost never get to talk to! *sigh* Time to go scrounge for food. Lates                   -Brendan Michael

      Well, I've finally decided to make one of these things, mainly out of boredom. See i used to keep an actual written journal for like 2 years but then i kinda grew away from that, but i must say, within the pages of that journal are some of my deepest, most&nbsp;revealing thoughts and emotions. Of course they're a&nbsp;bit irrelevant at this point seeing as they were simply emotions of the moment and nothing more. yet when i look back at those pages all those emotions come flooding back, if only for a brief moment.&nbsp; weird how that works, and then i end up thinking of how stupid/silly i was 2-3 years ago. oy i'm rambling, but hey! this is MY journal thingy and i can rant if i want to! so yea! there! alright, well there shall be more to come, until then...  -Brendan Michael

      Had such an awesome, kickass day at 6 flags today with britt,vicka,jay, and Victoryflet! Yea Victoryflet aka Fletty aka Eric is a kid me and Vicka met through the clan we're in and whom we play with in CS. He's totally cool and it was awesome to meet him! Got a little sick by the end of the night after riding every single roller coaster like 5 times each. Superman = the best roller coaster in new england. such a rush! but yea, we spent literally ALL day and night there! we got there at 1030 am and left at 1030 pm! We did all the crazy rides first, basically the coasters, then we left the park and got some pizza, then came back and did the waterpark for a good 2-3 hours and that was mad fun cuz it was soo goddamn hot out! then we went back to the rollercoasters and whatnot. it was such a great day! 6 flags owns! i'm ready to pass out now and i have work tomoro which bites but its at 1130 so thats better than anything earlier rite? rite. Orange carnival begins tomoro so thats cool too. i'll prolly goto the movies with morgan seeing as the other night wen we attempted to attend said event, i got us really lost to say the least, not gunna even attempt to explain HOW lost i got us but lets just say, i was ashamed at my navigations skills that nite. so yea, prolly do like a matinee after work so that should be good. see morgan is totally kickass and chill and i think she mite have a crush on me? she asked me one time if i'd ever hook up with her or date her. now morgan is a great girl but 1) i know and play hockey with her brother, and dating the younger sister of ANYBODY you're friends with is just plain wrong, it'd be like if one of my friends dated mariel. thatd be fucking fucked up! and 2) she's just not somebody i'd ever do that with. and so i told her these things and she was fine with it. and so i think we've begun a really good friendship and thats always a good thing. what's funny about this situation is that i'm better friends with morgan than i am with chris. but hey, what does it matter? alright, i'm done for the night cuz im tired as hell. lates.   -B
