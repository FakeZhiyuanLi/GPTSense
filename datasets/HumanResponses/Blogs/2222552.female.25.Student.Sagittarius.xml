      I hung out with my friend Ryland again last night... Its great being able to talk to someone with a brain... Its a real pain having to dumb things down to talk to people who aren't too bright (example my ex)... Ryland is one of the smartest guys I know, he has a bunch of tattoos and a nipple ring (I too have tattoos and a nipple ring)its great to have a friend I have things in common with... While I was out today grocery shopping he left a message asking me to call him at 8pm tonight when he gets off work.

      My friend I saw yesterday for the first time in at least 6-7 years came over last night... He and I talked all night about all the funny things we did in the past like strip down to our underwear and go swimming in a pond (while very drunk of course) this event took place in the early spring so there was still a thin layer of ice on this pond it was very cold that night... We then walked back to our friends place (walking thorough a small town) half naked... I laughed so hard last night I gave myself a headache. I had so much fun hanging out with Ryland... One entire summer hanging out with him consisted of getting drunk and going to taco bell or at least that's all I remember of it.  anyway more reminiscing to come he and I are going to hang out on Saturday night.

      I had such a cool day... On my way home from work walking to catch my bus I saw this guy who looked so familiar but I didn't want to say anything to him in case he wasn't who I thought he was... He was thinking the same but eventually he turned around and said my name and it was my old friend Ryland. We talked and went out for a coffee. It was so nice to bump into someone who I haven't seen in so long, seeing him made me realize exactly how far I have come, and how much I have accomplished in the past few years.

      Everyone knows how we Canadians live may 2-4 weekend... But for me it sucked I spent it looking at the weather network site making sure the weather was crappy for all the losers at my cottage... My own brother told everyone not to tell me about everyone going up because he doesn't want me there he even told my parents and they went along with it... He said he cant stand me and his girlfriend who was once one of my closest friends (until she met my brother) told me that since she and my brother are getting married she cant be my friend... Lucky for me I have people in my life who although they may not be related they act more like family than people who share the same genes. maybe one day I'll show all of them I am far better than they think... Too good to be associated with such childish behavior

      Well I have a crappy family...   #1 I have an exam in my night school class tonight and I really cant miss it but nobody in my family will help me by babysitting my daughter... It seems nobody wants me to better my life, and everything is more important like napping or grocery shopping.  #2 its almost the may long weekend and I have nothing to do... I have a family cottage I should be going to but my parents said I'm not welcome instead they are allowing my ex who is harassing and stalking me and his dirty tramp of a girlfriend go (this girl is trying to sleep with all the guys in this group of friends she has got 2 already from what I hear)... These people have called children's aid trying to get my daughter removed from my custody, they prank call me, they put my name and phone number in the local news paper, they have me charged with false allegations, break into my place, and sit in a car in my building parking lot for hours waiting for me to get home. This is only the big stuff there are tons of minor things these losers have done.  I wish I had a nice supportive family

      The superintendent of my building told me that while I was at work on Monday there was a creepy guy looking around the building (a few tenets told her about him) when she approached him he said he was waiting for me. She described him saying he is not to tall, fat, bald, with glasses driving a car with a sunroof (couldn't remember what colour)... This is likely my ex... he and his family have been harassing me but now its turned into stalking... And last Friday my place was broken into I think it was him or his crazy fat sister or his insane girlfriend who looks like a little boy... I have had to change my phone number because of these freaks, add extra locks on my door because of these losers and now he sits in his car all day while i am at work occasionally leaving it to look in my windows... I am really creeped out.

      I saw someone today who kinda use to be a friend of mine cheating on their significant other who I also know I'm not going to say how I know them though cuz if they were to read this they would know it was them and I feel being cheated on is bad enough but reading it on someone's blog is worse... Especially my blog after all the past issues.  my question to everyone who might stumble upon my blog is should I tell this person what I saw or let him find out on his own.   as much as I dislike this guy right now because of things he has said and done to me I still think its wrong his girlfriend is doing this to him.

      Its almost time to go to my cottage... Less than a week and I will be up on musky island drinking myself stupid. The best part is there want be anyone there to annoy me or piss me off.  I am getting so excited I have invited some friends and have asked that my brother and his girlfriend not be welcome as all they do is treat me poorly and act like they are so much better than everyone, and on my little vacation I don't need that crap.

      Today I am babysitting 3 little boys today and I myself have a 4 year old... There are twin 5 year old boys and a 3 year old... The little 3 year old is the sweetest little boy I have ever met... He is so cute if I could have another kid I would want him. So so sweet. maybe my friend Laura wont miss him if I don't give him back.

      I am going to my cottage to get drunker than I have been in a long time... Apparently there is going to be quite a few people there so I'll have plenty of people to drink and smoke with... And when I say smoke I'm not talking about cigarettes.  who knows there might be some cute guy there.

      I think that what my friend did for me last night proves that she is a good person.  I told her all about this group of people who have been harassing me and trying to upset me, she then stuck up for me. I was upset at first about what she did but I see now that she wants me to be happy and she thought that if she said something to these losers who look down on me, who think they are so much better, maybe they would see that their mean treatment of me is unwarranted. I am happy I have such great friends who would do whatever they can to help me feel better about myself, after all the abuse I put up with over the past year I feel really bad about myself and my life and I cant tell you how many times I just wanted to give up but after last night knowing this time I have made friends who do care.  I now know what I have to do. I have to forget about the insults, threats, the childish behavior, and mean emails. I have to forget these losers and everything they have done because in the long run they will be the ones looked down on as they are nothing special. When they don't have someone to pick on they eventually turn on each other just like they turned on me... I wont be their victim anymore.  I totally believe in karma and if someone is a good person then good things will happen to them, if someone is bad then they will eventually get theirs... I cant wait until they do.

      I had such a weird day I have been stuck inside for a week with a grumpy 4 year old who has chicken pox... I think today I had a nervous break down and I called a friend crying and just spilling out all the things that have been bothering me for the past year... Been so stressed I developed an anxiety disorder with occasional panic attacks. ok on with the story after about 2 maybe 3 hours on the phone crying and venting my friend offered to come over and babysit so I could get out and just feel free for a little while. So I called up a girl from work and went out for a bit...I was feeling so much better until I got home and she showed me something she did... I am not too impressed and in fact what she did could cause more problems and more stress, I understand she was only sticking up for me from some people who treat me like shit but now I guarantee it will get about 100x worse

      I know what I am about to say is terrible... About 2 years ago I hooked up one of my best friends with my brother, I now wish I didn't... True the both of them are happy but now instead of having only my brother treating me like shit my former friend acts like she is so much better than I am. She use to call me every day and hang out every weekend and now neither my brother or she even give me the time of day. even my brothers friends would talk to me about how much they hate her and her best friend, especially my ex he hates her and her best friend (the best friend he nicknamed horse face, and constantly called her nasty) anyway if I could go back in time I would have never got my former friend and my brother together. It ruined my friendship and it ruined what little relationship I had with my family

      I am having a bunch of people go to my cottage for the July long weekend... Its going to be so much fun. My brother wont be there and neither will his girlfriend who use to be a friend of mine... Its going to be great I'm going to party and have fun and wont have to deal with crap from my brother and his girlfriend... It seems whenever I am in the same room as them all they do is try and cause problems... That's all they did last time I went to my cottage with them.

      I have this huge assignment due for class next Wednesday night. One of the group members (a real bitch) decided to screw over the rest of the group, she went to the teacher and said she has done everything when the rest of the group has been working their asses off to make this assignment great... When the group got together we did everything on this backstabbing bitches laptop so she has all the information. the teacher told this whore she could hand in the whole assignment on her own and now the rest of the group has been screwed and will fail the class. the screwed group members are going to talk to the teacher and I hope this fucking bitch is found out for the lying backstabber she really is...

      I have come to the conclusion I attract the&nbsp;crazies... See there is my daughters father, my ex mark(who only recently stopped stalking me), and yesterday I was on my way out to meet someone i stepped off the bus&nbsp;and out of nowhere I was&nbsp;approached by a drunk Russian guy who was asking me out telling me how I am a real woman and he was trying to convince me to go for a walk with him.&nbsp; luckily for me&nbsp;the person I was meeting showed up and the creepy drunk Russian backed off.

      Have you ever woken up and not known anything... I woke up this morning and I couldn't remember what day it was or&nbsp;where I was... It took me a good 10 min of laying in bed before I could recall any of this it was so weird. Lately I have been forgetting things that I should know and it is so frustrating, I'm also very tired it seems I can never get enough sleep, I feel like something is wrong with me... I think I am going to go to the Dr. And see if this could be something more than just forgetfulness, and being tired, maybe it will be linked to the abnormal MRI results I had last summer.

       I wish there was something exciting to do. I have already been to the pool with the kid and taken her bike riding with a little friend of hers, we have even been to the mall, and cleaned up the apartment... It feels like this day is just going on and on and wont end, its only 3:30 I cant wait until bed time I'm so tired

      I am so frustrated...  I invited a friend over to my place and she brought someone else who I don't get along with at all, this girl picked a fight with my friend about what "Home should feel like" and when she lost that argument she decided to argue with me this girl was clearly wrong and refused to admit it so I refused to fight, I told her "there is no point in arguing we weren't going to agree and the currency exchange rate from Canada to the u.s. is of no concern to me at this point in time" so she pouted and forced my friend to drive her home I didn't even have a chance to talk and visit with my friend who I don't often see because of this other girl. After they left I looked up the exchange rates online and she was wrong, $100 American is not worth $166 Canadian... And the rudest thing of all, I bought dinner for everyone tonight and not so much as a "thank you" from this girl who thinks she knows it all.

      I had a great time at my cottage first night we met some people and ended up at their cottage in the hot tub, on the drunken boat ride back we crashed into our new friends dock and the dock was found floating unattached in the middle of the lake (likely wont be invited back there again)  2nd night we went to the grand reopening of the Victoria Lodge that had burned down the summer before, I had some local French boys hitting on me and buying me drinks (guess they are not use to cute city girls) 3rd night I was so tired I ended up going to bed somewhat early after smoking a little pot (well more than a little)  then I went home the next morning there was so much traffic the usual 4 hour drive took 9 hours
