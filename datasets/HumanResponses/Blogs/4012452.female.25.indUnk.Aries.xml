      today i had an epiphany!&nbsp; why not type my thoughts onto a screen and let the world read it.&nbsp; it's one that many others have had,&nbsp;so i don't expect full credit for creativity.   i'll start off&nbsp;by telling a little about myself.&nbsp; i'm 25, the mother of a handsome 7 year old named&nbsp;"krs" and married to a&nbsp;slightly younger, equally handsome&nbsp;man&nbsp;we'll call&nbsp;"vash".&nbsp; i work for one of the biggest law firms in houston, texas.&nbsp; we've just adopted a cat name cloudy.&nbsp; i drive a honda civic which i&nbsp;adore, and i'm gradually transforming it into a rice-racer.&nbsp; my plans are on&nbsp;hold for the time being because my husband&nbsp;has been out of work for the past 3 months and 7 days.&nbsp; but today might be&nbsp;his lucky day!&nbsp; (good luck honey!)&nbsp;&nbsp;i like to watch anime, comedies and suspense thrillers.&nbsp; my fav mangas are&nbsp;gunsmith cats and battle angel.&nbsp; my goals in life are to become a pretty drifter&nbsp;(which means i'll have to relocate to california one day) and be the best capoeirista i can be.&nbsp;&nbsp;i have a lot of likes and dislikes that change as i continue to age and this is what has lead to the creation of&nbsp;my speakerboxx (thank you Outkast).&nbsp; unfortunately, this great idea came while i was at work, so we'll get&nbsp;into that&nbsp;later.&nbsp;   STAY TUNED FOR THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF...my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      i finally gave in and jumped on the bandwagon. i joined a message board where the majority of my friends post. now i spend my time reading stupid conversations people have w/one another. i must admit some of it is entertaining, but it gets disturbing at times. i'd kill to have a deep, intellectual conversation w/a total stranger via the board, but those subjects are taboo. it's a little disappointing to know that a lot of people my age aren't concerned w/politics or saving the rain forests, feminism, etc. i'd like to hear people's POVs on the matter. i don't want to force my beliefs on others; i just want to learn what they're passionate about.  i'm new to this, so maybe i'll work my way onto other message boards. any suggestions?

      i told myself when i started this blog i would post something no matter what. i wouldn't hold back. i'm of mexican descent, so this is easier said than done. throughout my childhood, like other latinos i know, i was programmed to do the opposite...don't talk about your problems, your life or your family; don't show any emotions; be proud. now that i'm an adult, i'm finally able to experience huge weights being lifted off my shoulders because i'm able to open up and talk to others (with some difficulties of course).  i'm writing all this because i haven't neglected to write in my blog. i've written a couple of entries. the first was something about me; i thought people might find it boring or stupid. the second was about the recent argument my husband and i had. i really wanted to publish it, but i couldn't bring myself to do it. i just didn't know if i'd regret it later.  i'll tell you about the argument w/out all the negative emotions that were running through me the first time. here it goes:  my husband has a friend who causes a lot of arguments when she resurfaces. she only does this when she needs something. i finally had to reveal my true feelings about this "friendship". i've put-up w/her for the past 2 years, and i wasn't about to do it again. it's safe to say that our honeymoon stage is over, so no more understanding wife. i'm not being unreasonable. trust me...she was no friend and he knew it. he complained about her, her stupid decisions and her gold-digging personality countless times. i was actually doing him a favor. we're fine now. needless to say, that "friendship" is over. :=)
