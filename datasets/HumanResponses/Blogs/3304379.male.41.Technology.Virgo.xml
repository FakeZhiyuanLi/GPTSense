      At the gym today, I talked to Mr. P about kids today with all their piercing, tattoos etc.  They just aren't creative enough.  I told him my idea of a great tattoo I plan on getting.  He agreed and both of us are going to a tattoo parlor soon to get some great tattoos.  Here is what I am going to get, you never see anyone with this. A "three day old shiner (blackeye)"  As the blackeye heals, its turns yellowish, purple, some green, red and of course, black.  I am going to get a perfect "black eye" and also, I want a mole.  The same one "Kitty" has from gunsmoke.  I can make up different stories each time someone asks "hey, where did you get that shiner! Been to any bars lately ?"  I purposed for Mr. P, stitches.  In his case, since he has short hair, stitches circling the top of his head starting at the forehead.  When people ask, he can say he had a brain transplant.  He also wants a bloody nose.  You would be amazed at how people will fall for this...with the state of our educational system and all...  I gotta write some code now...

      Yep, I got another e-mail intended to go to other people where I work with in a different department with a name similar to mine.  Outlook just plugs my name right in!  Thanks outlook!    Of course, have to respond to each reply...  names have been changed, confidential stuff left out.  -----Original Message-----  From:   Some guy that works in another department.  Thanks Outlook!

Thanks Outlook! Subject: Special Flowers     XXXX,   When I think of you I think of flowers that are flowery.   You make my time here so special.  The things I learn from you make me want to be more like you.   I am glad you are my friend.   We should go camping.   -XXXX    My response to e-mail below.  Reply-all  I am glad you guys included me in on the camp out.   Since I am from the south (south Carolina) I can bring my special cast iron skillet, set line (we have to camp near a body of water so I can catch our food, kill it, or both) and a jug of stump water.   Not any ole stump water, but Burl Cadaverine's new barrel aged with new cherries he puts in straight from the tree, lets them soak for a month to impart a slight cherry flavor, then racks and we have a peanut boil and cherries.  I broke my nose last year at the annual event and my friend lost a toenail, but I digress....   I will bring my copper worm meal for the fish.  Can someone bring a frog gig and miner hat (with a halogen bulb please...) ?   I can't  wait!  yarddog  -----Original Message-----  From:   Some guy that works in another department.  Thanks Outlook!

There is a lot of team building going on right now between XXXX division and XXXX division so the level of enthusiasm is running a bit high right now.  Please disregard.   Thank you.

XXXX, it sounds as though you only intended this to be for XXXX and yourself.  Is there room for everyone, cuz I wanna go now.    -----Original Message-----  From:    Yarddog Sent:    Tuesday, August 12, 2003 5:45 PM  To:      People I don't work with.  Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject: RE: Special Flowers   Now Brent wants to go and I am pretty sure Hair will go too. Last time Brent and I went camping, I took him snipe hunting. Imagine to my surprise, he bagged a snipe.   This had a rough ending and I lost a lot of camping gear as it was dark and he actually bagged a rare species of bird called a "Purple Sandpiper"    urlLink  Purple Sandpiper    I didn't know it was rare, and we fried it up in my skillet with swamp cabbage.  The game warden came, (she was also a card carrying member of PETA), she freaked out, pulled out her stun gun on Brent and by the time she jammed it in my neck, the batteries were run down.   I threw Olive oil in Brent's face (trying to cut back on LDL's) to wake him from his cadaver state.  Little did I know, his heart had stopped from the continuous electric shock so when I kicked him in the chest, he awoke.   He had a look on his face like a kid who just popped a charred, burnt, marshmallow in his mouth and the inside marshmallow goo that is still at boiling temp meets the tongue and sears it.   We both ran like kittens when you start up the vacuum cleaner when she pulled out her revolver and started randomly shooting and yelling that this was the first time the park had ever seen a purple sandpiper, and we had eaten it.   She was fireball mad, but we made it back to my truck (with fake bullet holes, see black S-10 in XXXX parking lot) and got out of there faster than a pack of doves at a cat show.   So, count Brent in too.  He has a 12 foot frog gig that is the envy of any everglades  hermit living on one of the 10,000 islands they now call home.   yarddog

Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject:  client   The original e-mail with confidential stuff left out.    I mentioned that we are interested in learning more about the direction of their company noting their presence as a partner.  Earl strongly declared that the relationship between XXXX and XXXX is very important. He would like XXXX to remain the primary upstream feed with XXXX taking a secondary position.  They currently have 50000 clients.  12000000 people on staff.  And are looking for ways to grow their business.  They believe they can do this offering some thickness/content to their site.  They also note that there is a daily battle for quality downstream (distribution).  In my opinion, this is a company that is honest and wants to improve.  We should help them.  Suggestions? Thoughts?  I would like to schedule a follow up call with XXXX as soon as possible based upon everyone's feedback.  Please advise.  XXXX     My response:  Yes, XXXX and I have done battle with many a rainbow trout downstream.  The distribution is not the best, but now that he has opened a trout hatchery, things should be looking up near term.  He only has one obstacle...his wife loves cats.  So much so that she opened a kitten ranch next to the trout hatchery.  It is quite a site seeing all of these kittens clawing their way up the roof, swimming around the cold water, clawing at the baby trout.  The head mama cat and Spartacus, the old Tom, could really change things at the trout farm.  I saw Sparticus and a group of young tom cats, close to 12, the same number that just about brought down the Roman empire meeting behind the tobacco barn on a regular basis.  Sparticus starts the meeting with a big Brown trout.  The other cats are all pupils.  I believe they are up to something and frankly, I am not sure I like it.  XXXX has advised me of the places he plans on releasing the trout up  and down claw river.  I plan on being there to catch fish.  However, I bet Earl, being the southerner he is and his fondness for sickomore pie that his wife conjures up, he has probably told her the whereabouts of the release points.  She in turn sleeps with Sparticus.  Loose lips ruin fishing trips.  I believe Sparticus and his band of Orange toms are planning on beating me to the fish.  His first lieutenant is Agent Orange.  Perilous times are ahead, but XXXX is a good guy and man, can his wife cook!  We need more southern food down here.  They would be a great addition with Brent Miller leading the way.  Back to codeville.     -----Original Message-----  From:   Yarddog   Sent:   Tuesday, September 02, 2003 6:53 PM  To:     People I don't work with.  Wrong department, similar name.  Thanks Outlook! Subject:  proceed!   Original e-mail   How do we want to proceed with this partner? I spoke with XXXX this afternoon. Very forthcoming and humble guy     My response:         I agree on the forthcoming and humble attributes of this gentleman.  We once shared a common area in the Florence SC flea market.  I was selling home grown beefeater tomatoes that were the size of Victorian dinner plates.  He was trying to get rid of a litter of half Rottewieller / pit bull mix puppies.  It was quite hot under that tin roof in July and the place smelled of redneck sweat.  I always thought it smelled like a Big Deluxe hamburger with extra Vidalia onions but XXXX thought it was more like a baby borg maturation chamber post born.  Yes, he was really into Star Trek...          I went to my S-10 1989 Black Chevy pickup truck with the fake bullet holes to get another box of swisher sweet cigars for us since the smoking laws don't apply in SC.  A lot of laws don't apply there and XXXX even questions the laws of physics in the Pee Dee region...          As I walked back into the flea market, squeezing in-between women wearing tube tops and dressed out at nearly 250lbs smelling of gardenia perfume mixed with kerosene to tighten the skin in-case some of the cellulite broke loose and went on a rampage, I noticed XXXX was talking to one of the other vendors....Patti the palm reader.  She looked like a cross between Janice Joplin and Marlin Monroe with a dash of Haitian voodoo about her that made me squirm when I went by the table filled with old pin cushions with various needles and such sticking out at odd angles.          At that moment, I heard a commotion coming from my table that XXXX was supposed to be watching while I got us some Cigars.  I made my way through humanity slipping through like a 1 inch thick greased black snake going down a length of 1.5 inch PVC pipe toward my table.  When I got there, XXXX's half Rottewieller/Pitt Bull puppies had escaped from their metal cage by chewing through the metal, jumped up on my table, and were now laying waste to my huge, beautiful tomatoes not unlike my brother and I scarfing up all the burnt match head tips in ash trays at the Charleston Piggly Wiggly, eating the tops off until my mother finally gave in and bought us little debbie cakes.          The puppies had there way with my tomatoes.  Red tomato meat all over them and their mouths.  They looked like they were laughing as they mauled my tomatoes.  The biggest of the big southern patrons there was mulling over a table full of ratchet sets and bootleg cassettes.  He heard the commotion and immediately came to the table in awe, sporting a pair of huge overalls that could raise the titanic if used as a flotation device, you know, tying the legs in knots and such so you can float until rescued.  I believe by the look on his face that he thought  these mutts had actually killed something and the tomatoes was blood.  He bought every baby dog on my table, taking the clawing beasts away, licking the tomato off of each other.          XXXX was counting a mountain of cash,  I was starring at what was left of my tomatoes.  I was sporting a look that must have conveyed that those tomatoes were the biological  children that I never had.  Of course, if XXXX had thought a little further, why would I be willing to sell my children to people to eat?  He split the cash with me like a perfect gentleman and I bought an authentic white skull of a bull with the horns to go on my front porch and a toastmaster fan and XXXX got his palm read by Patti.          XXXX would be a great partner, I am sure of it.  He loves animals and his animals love tomatoes.

      1)Make food for this Friday.  Found a kicken recipe that will help me with my Circada problem.   urlLink    2)Gotta start writing about Norton.  It will start as a story, but will eventually become true.  I can't wait to find my Norton.  He will rule.  The whole idea is so absurd.  I can't wait to make it happen.  Need a back hoe.  3) worked out my legs.  Wife hates my butt.  Says it is too small. Concentrating on making my butt bigger.  My butt hurts.  Maybe find butt padding.  4) Dude was working on the workout machines today.  He had a belly that would impress my friends in SC.  Easy a 12 pack a day belly.  If he locked his truck keys inside, there is no way he would get in the back window with that belly.  I watched him while I did abs.  I hope mine is that big one day.  5) Promised my wife a website and a rose garden.  Gotta do the website first so I can afford the rose garden.  6) met geek girl today.  She is nice.  7) Gotta finish this project.  When done, me and my new Nun transplanted liver are going to do some damage to my wine cellar.

      I need signoff on my functional specification today. What a bore. I can't wait to write some code. I did, however just score some XXX coffee from a chic in accounting wearing all red, sporting high heals, and a look that would stop a clock. Hell, I think I am an hour younger already.   Once I finish this coffee, I will be able to work. I wonder if I can write a love poem to XXX coffee accounting chic and she would get it?  OH NO!  There is trouble with my functional spec!   Please lord don't make me re-do it again...No, for the love of coffee.  No!

      Jun is my programming buddy at work.  He has a sweet ride.  It has windows that roll up, kick-ass stereo, and AIR-CONDITIONING!  My truck has none of that.  See story with Worf, my friggen chicken.  He asked me last Thursday if he could borrow my truck for the weekend and I could use his car.  I said hell yes.  On Friday, I asked, out of curiosity what he was going to do with my truck, not that it mattered.  I bought it 15 years ago at a scratch and dent sale in Charleston SC after Hurricane Hugo whacked us with 138 mph sustained winds.    So, I am nostalgic about my hurricane truck.  The only vehicle left on the parking lot after the storm.  The corvettes were safely parked inside the dealership, unfortunately, the roof caved in on them.  My truck took the storm like a man, even though I refer to my truck as "her".  She has been places jeeps would have problems negotiating.  (I keep a shovel in the back at all times to dig her out...and a pitchfork, but that is another story...)    Jun found my truck has qualities that his car doesn't possess.  1. Nobody would park next to him at his apartment.  I think they are scared.  I must admit, I got a little crazy buying those fake, stick on bullet holes and put them all over my truck.  You would think I did a tour in southern Iraq with an American flag waving off of my antenna.  2. You get respect in this truck.  Nobody wants to cut you off, give you the bird, etc.  See above statement on possible reasons nobody will park next to my truck.  3. The passenger side door will come wide open when making a left turn.  I can't count the items I have lost from my passenger seat when this happens.  Luckily, all Jun lost was a bag of groceries.  I almost lost my cat, "agent orange" and a couple of my southern buddies got a well deserved scare.  He brought my truck back with some mud on the tires...I was proud.  I was hoping that he would get it stuck in the Everglades somewhere.  I love to dig my truck out of private property.  I take pride in doing this.  Well, here is his story.  I have to go home and watch Enterprise and keep my Amazon wife filled with wine.    John, how's my ride? As for me, I'm already having fun with the truck. Here's how it went.   Jun: *Loading up the old truck with groceries and stuff *   Professional beggar at walmart parking lot in nice suit and tie: Hello sir, I ran out of gas. Could you possibly help me out a bit?   Jun: *looks at gas station inside the walmart parking lot, 900 feet away* Which car is it? (wouldn't mind pushing this guy's car)   PBWPLNST: This one, the FORD SENTRA   Jun: *YA. RIGHT, Ford makes Sentra. Uh-huh. And it's a Toyota Collora* I guess I can push the car for you?   PBWPLNST: No, my car is right here and can't even make it to the gas station. Can you spare a few bucks so I can go home?    Jun: um, I don't have any on me, but if your car can make it to the gas station, I can give you a gallon - that'll get you home. (I don't carry cash later in the evening, but I had a card on me) Do you want me to push?  *I go behind the collora, err, Ford Sentra*   PBWPLNST: *PANICS* Ah, sir, please don't touch the car, the alerm will go off.   Jun: It's YOUR car, right? (playing game on this guy at this point)   PBWPLNST: *His face says BEEP! EXCEPTION OCCURRED - my logic blew up* Oh Man, just give me a few bucks, will ya? *executing the catch-all code*   Jun: SO...what?? Do you do this all day long in here? See, I don't know how much you are making but you're in nice suit, and just look at MY TRUCK. I can't even afford to fix this stupid window. *demonstrates the driver's side window behavior* Try that guy squeezing stuff in his Benz convertible. See, you don't have the eyes to choose the right client for your....*starts to lecture this guy for fun of it*   PBWPLNST: *Goes straight to the benz*   Jun: *I AM VICTORIOUS!* *Finds a whole new value in the old truck*

      Well, had to pick up Brandon, my 16 year old step-son.  He has no drivers license, so I cart him around.  Normally I would be pissed, but the thought of paying that high auto insurance keeps me calm.  However, right now, I am far from calm.  Got a ticket and a lecture from a pissed off police lady named Alice.  It all started because I was taking my truck that has a broken radio, hence no entertainment.  So, I brought Worf with me, my red headed rooster.    Everything was cool as we traveled down Immokalee rd until we hit some sort of big Everglades bug.  It got caught in the windshield wiper and struggled to get away, but was pressed against the windshield at 60 miles an hour.  Worf, not the sharpest chicken I have, decided he would have a snack, not understanding the finer points of say, a windshield.    He was pecking and flapping his wings right in my field of view trying to get at this bug.  I tried to slap him off of the dash, but he jumped up, got one of his feet stuck in my mouth, the other on my forehead and he made one last hell of an attempt at stretching his head through the steering wheel to the dash to get this bug.    I ran off the road and hit a pile of sand.  My chin hit hard on the steering wheel.  Once I came to my senses, I grabbed Worf to make sure he was alright. He was flapping and clucking like hell.  I tried to calm his nerves, and as the feeling in my mouth came back I started to choke.    That's when officer Alice blinded me with a Q-beam light in my eyes and started yelling at me. I felt something in my throat and instinctively coughed it up.  It came out and hit the officer in the chest.  Worf's toe.  I had bit it off when my chin hit the wheel.  Alice freaked out.  Other cops showed up and drew their guns.  I was frozen, holding my screaming chicken minus a toe, Alice screaming intermittently, I was yelling at the officer and Worf to shut the hell up, when damn if my radio didn't start working.    Highway to hell by AC/DC came on and drowned out everyone's yelling and screaming.  I held Worf and went for the sound knob when the policeman yelled "DON'T MOVE!".  I bet I looked just like the tin man after he got rained on and froze up with rust.  Just eyes moving.  The officer hit my radio, (now it really doesn't work) and he made me get out of the truck.  I would not let go of Worf.  I think they finally figured out I was no harm, especially since the only thing I was wearing was shorts, tanktop, and a chicken minus one toe, and a tin man look.  If officer Alice were a man, I am quite sure she would have beat me like an old woman beats a dirty rug during spring cleaning.  To make a long story short, I got a ticket for driving left of center, and a summons to appear in friggen court for carrying unrestrained livestock.  They threatened to make me leave Worf right there on the side of the road.  That took a lot of convincing otherwise.  I finally picked up Brandon, made him go into Walgreens to get bandages, ointment and such and let him drive while I bandaged up Worf's toe.  Tonight, I will let him sleep in the Lani.  I dug some cut worms for him.  I swear, I don't think he even misses the toe.    I think this chicken played me for a bowl of worms.

      Had a killer workout, then talked to the high protein chick maker.  I get more info from her each time I talk to her.  Now I know how many kids she has, her age, what her father does (a bug spray man), where he is from (AL) and something about the Cumberland gap.  I commented on the rings on her red painted toes.  I will keep getting more info from her to get a complete profile.  The nerds are trippen again.    urlLink www.neurosonics.com/tech/bgm-kurzweil.html   Talk is already underway on how to link minds to popup adds... I need some exploded corn kernels...
