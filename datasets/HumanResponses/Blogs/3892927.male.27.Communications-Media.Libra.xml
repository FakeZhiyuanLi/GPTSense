      Picking the "Lesser of Two Evils" seems to have reached new levels of truth.  It appears that even the candidates have begun to follow this philosophy.  When I hear "I'm George W. Bush, and I approved this message" come spewing forth from the television, I know I'm about to hear more attacks upon Senator Kerry.  And here's the problem with this type of campaigning: It's an easy way for a candidate to avoid having to tell us why we would be best served by voting for him instead of the other guy.  When a candidate's entire election strategery revolves around making the other guy look bad, where's the merrit in that?  We should know by now that any fact or statistic can be spun to benefit anyone, so the "information" found in these slander campaigns is meaningless.  Don't tell me how bad the other guy is, tell me how good you are.  If you honestly believe you are deserving of my vote, tell me why.  Give me a reason TO vote for YOU, not a reason NOT to vote for HIM.  When I hear a candidate say nothing but bad things about the opposition, I conclude that there must be no value to candidate saying those things.  And this whole concept really stems from the biggest problem I see with American politics.  It's no longer about the issues (if it ever really was).  The electoral process has been reduced to a very simple, evil philosophy: republicans vs. democrats.  Not "issue vs. issue".  Not "war vs. peace".  Not "health care vs. economy".  It's nothing more than a petty pissing contest between two irrelevant groups of rich people.  How can I say "irrelevant"?, you ask.  The existence of political parties is predicated upon an flawed ideal.  What we need in this crumbling country are strong leaders, without political party ties, who can focus on the issues that really matter with no concerns about what might happen to the wallets of certain groups of rich dudes and their petty wives.  Democracy will only survive if we can shift the focus back to the majority - not the upper one percent of the finacial community.  Put the focus back on the issues.  Stop advertising hate of the other party.  It's stupid, petty and childish.

      So I was listening to Rush Limbaugh the other day (I don't have an excuse, sorry) and heard him get rather excited about something that struck me as funny.  His excitement seemed to stem from a belief, backed up by research from somewhere or another, that American youth is becoming more conservative.  And because of this, he seems to believe that this means that liberalism is dying and the republicans will gain control of the universe, or something along those lines.  I very rarely agree with anything this man says, but I usually appreciate his honesty and non-apologetic way of expressing his opinion.  More people should be so comfortable with their opinions.  But it seems that this time his ego, disconnection from middle class Americans and rampant disregard for reality have misled him.  Shocker.  I agree that more young people are leaning toward conservative values.  But not so many as he is being led to believe.  I agree that many people my age, and younger, have stopped rebelling against their parents for no reason, and in many cases, have grown to think of their parents as friends.  But not all.  The problem I have with the logic expressed by Mr. Limbaugh, is that conservative view points, family values, and the like does not mean a belief in republican philosophy.  Nor should it suggest an extreme right-winged connection.  The younger generation consists mainly of people who are exactly the antithesis of republican-ism (and democrat-ism for that matter).  Free-thinking, non-conformist individuals with concerns larger than what any "party" is concerned with.  Those concerns?  The integrity of the American government and its citizens.  The republican vs. democrat nonsense has progressed to the point where the actual well-being of the country or its people is at best a secondary issue.  Each of the main parties is more concerned with defeating the other guy than it is with making any meaningful changes or improvements upon the systems that are now available to us.  There are a lot of concerned citezens, free thinkers, intelligent citizens - registered voters - with no interest at all in party affiliations.  Independently registered voters looking for a WORTHY candidate to cast his or her vote for.  They don't care about race, creed or depth-of-pocket.  Let's see someone worth voting for and let the party lines fall away as they should.  For our country to survive and prosper we need candidates more concerned with what matters than with what any political party's agenda includes.  I make no apologies for disagreeing with Rush, after all, it's he who repeatedly says that there is no one other than himself who has the junk to speak his mind, so here it is.  And before anyone calls me unpatriotic or whatever other nonsense crap they might want to throw out there, keep this in mind.  I signed on the line for eight years of service to my country and will answer whatever call is made of me.  But I will always ask for the best we have as a country, and I haven't seen it yet.  Toodles.

      Ok, so first off let me say that I was pretty happy with the first one.  The only problem I had with it was the Green Goblin - terrible character, poorly written.  Now, with that said, after seeing the second installment, I now believe the first one was rubbish.  Spiderman 2 is a superior movie from any angle you look at it.  Better writing, better acting, killer special effects, and a villian that remind me of a Power Rangers reject.  I'm not interested in spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it, but take my word for it ... when the train comes on screen, grab a hold of something and hang the hell on.  Great scene.  Not to be missed.  Alfred Molina has found himself in one of the most perfectly cast roles ever.  He brought life and depth to a character who saw relatively minimal screen time, and in a superhero movie, that is no small accomplishment.  And with a teaser ending such as the one provided I can't wait to see the thrill-ride that will surely be Spiderman 3.  If you haven't seen it, go right now and see it.  If you have seen, go right now and see it again.  That is all.

      I really don't know what's going to end up on this page ... but I thought it would be a good place to post some of the thoughts, ideas and other nonsense that comes sputtering out of my brain.  I'm guessing there will be movie and music reviews, social commentaries and other stuff along those lines.  I may even post some of my otherwise published pieces.  Poetry, news articles, plays, songs ... whatever.  I may even take requests - but don't hold your breath.  And if something that you find here is offensive to you - keep in mind, you don't have to be looking at any of this to begin with.  And some of the crap that comes out of my head is bound to offend someone, so consider yourself warned.  That's it for now.  Enjoy.  Or don't.  I don't really care.  Jordan
