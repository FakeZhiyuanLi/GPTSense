      So, i'm here in Bhimavaram, a town way way way out in the country, a 9 hour train ride from Hyderabad and it's like losing touch with the rest of the world.  It's really hard to get on the internet bc they only have dial-up and it's soooo slow and this is the doctor's computer...  Mine wouldn't take that cable.  blah.  Bhimavaram is so different from anything i have ever seen.  Lots of palm trees and open land with these fields full of water where they grow rice, and there's water buffalo and pigs and chickens and goats and cows all over the place.  The traffic here is still completely crazy.  The people extremely poor... When i got out of the train and the doctor picked me up at the station, we were walking out and there were all these people selling stuff and entertaining...  well one of them was this man with a baby (about 2 1/2 or 3) and a girl (about 10).  Anyway, he was holding the baby and the baby was arching his back over the man's arms (the baby was doing it on his own) and the man then picked him up and started yelling something.  The Dr. told me they put on a show that consists of the man throwing the little boy up in the air and making him stand on his hands and stuff like that, while the girl also dances...    anyway, things are going incredibly well.  The doctor is so wonderful and he just seems so wise and experienced and he's very warm and friendly.  He's so excited that I'm here and I already have so many projects that i will be working on.  I'm making a documentary of the Trust, it's mission, accomplishments, and work, and another training video for the teachers at one of the model classrooms run by the trust (for little kids 3-7).  Then with photography I have this great project that I'm starting that will hopefully impact the community - it's a project that brings forth the ideas of respect, gender equality, equality in general among human beings, and to some extent will defy the caste system but in a quiet way, softly, just trying to push them without too many words.  I will also be making posters of photographs with important messages to put up in the community, and for this we will hopefully have the help of the printing press nearby.    OK but anyway, i have to take off now.  now sure when i will write again, but i will try to do so soon.  In any case, i'll be making my own updates on my computer and i'll try to send them if i can at some point.  Love to all, charlie

      I'm sitting in the hotel restaurant in Hyderabad with some naan (indian bread), a cup of coffee, and a wireless connection half an hour until i leave for the train station.  could i ask for much more?  the rain in india reminds me of home...  heavy and wet, it's like heaven is about to fall, a waterfall for an hour, and then the sky clears; the first drops get the earth wet and the smell is delightful, so moist and refreshing; a breath of life. but here on the streets there's nowhere to go.  everyone gets soaked.

      Soooo....  i went into the city today.  Not knowing what to expect i decided to go the safer way and for 40 dollars i got a hotel driver to take me Mumbai (35min car ride) and - listen to this - stay with me and take me sightseeing for 8 whole hours! Yes, it was great.  However, i wished and wished so much of the time i was in the car, that i was just walking on my own by the side of the street, just looking; because every single thing i saw - from the buildings, to the wild way traffic moves, the people, the beauty, the incredible poverty, the richness, the thousands of pigeons that crowded in on sidewalks and balconies all over the city and then flew away all together making this incredible sound... - i just wanted to stop and take a moment to take everything in, to take a photograph and just make every second in time, everything that was happening last forever.  Maybe one way to describe this strange beauty is that it seems like all of life is on display in the streets of India, from birth to death and everything in between...  nothing can escape you, and it's sad but somewhat miraculous at the same time.    This was just my first day, so i think i will survive that little bit of disillusionment of being protected from a lot of this by a car.  And one difficult thing is that since i look so different, it is hard to evade people coming up to me and trying to sell me stuff, which gets a little difficult sometimes.  I learned that not looking people in the eye and doing things like you know what's going on keeps you from getting too much extra attention...    But here go some more details of things i saw.  I went to this place next to the railway station; my driver explained it was a laundromat... It was like a huge pit, with all these cubicles with water and the people would be standing a little more than ankle-depth in the water in each cubicle and would hand wash the clothes scrubbing the soap really hard on it and then would beat the clothes against the sides.  It looked extremely poor and so tiring and the water was so dirty and hot.  We were looking from a distance.  A girl trying to sell me a peacock feather fan, who i ended up giving chewing gum to instead, explained that 'no, madame', it was only men because that water was dirty... The ladies do laundry at home, if they are married, with the clean water.   I also had a chance to visit the house where Mahatma Gandhi actually lived and prayed for a large part of his life.  The house is now a museum, but it's really incredible because they have tried to keep his room like he had it (you can't go in bc there's glass walls) and they have photographs of him all over the place.  It was so amazing and beautiful and i felt so honored to be walking down the same halls and stairs he once did...  It was a wonderful experience.  I also took my first breath of fresh Arabian Sea breeze.  I saw this big monument called The Gateway of India, right by the ocean, went into a Hindu temple, visited some gardens, and then at night I went and did some shopping, which was just great.  So i got back to my hotel at 8:30, just in time for dinner, Lufthasa airlines' treat.  It was delicious.  :)  OK, so i'm off now, heading to the airport to see if my bags have arrived and to leave for Hyderabad.  lots and lots of love, charlie

      So... the adventure began already.  I left Boston (6pm, july 12), supposed to fly to Zurich (7am arrival, july 13), then Bombay (9pm arrival), then Hyderabad (4:30am arrival, july 14), then a 9 hour train ride to my little town, Bhimavaram.     However, being the poor artist that i am, when they offered 5 travelers 450 euros to change flights, i was the first one in line.  This was quite a change.  Now I had to fly from Zurich to Stuttgart, then to Frankfurt, and finally a 1am arrival in Bombay.  Despite the hassle of airplane changes, a couple of jogs through the airport to make flights on time, and even holding back a plane and speeding in a little van to catch an airplane they held up for us in mid-runway, things were ok; it became quite an acceptable - even fun - adventure.   Problem was that when i got to Bombay, out of the 5 people that did what i did, all the luggage came fine, EXCEPT FOR MINE...  that's right.  damn it.    So, I've decided to stay here in Bombay for a day and leave for Hyderabad tomorrow instead.  It's pretty sweet though bc they set me up in this hotel called the Orquid, and i truly feel like a queen.  The room is so big...  I can access all the lights in my room and bathroom, change the room temperature, call room service, laundry service, arrange for wake up calls, ask them to clean my room, and send out a 'do not disturb' signal, all from a little machine next to my KING size bed.  Plus i have a little living room with 2 couches, desk and chair, TV, and a MINI BAR (!) with Bacardi Breezers and Indian drinks and chocolates, and chips...  I already drank all the complementary coffee available - which explains why i'm up at 5:05am.  And a wonderful bathroom.  Tomorrow I'm going out into the city, which is like 45 min. away, taking advantage of my day here, and finally having my first look at India.  So exciting...
