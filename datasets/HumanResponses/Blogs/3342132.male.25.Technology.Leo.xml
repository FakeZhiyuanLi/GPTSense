						   Did the  g mail  f ree the  e mail market? Definitely does look like it. At least it's made the free email market competitive with  urlLink Yahoo  giving 100MB and others like  urlLink Rediff  giving 1GB.    Now, is it really the space that matters? Does size really matter? Yes, it would to a certain extent. But, how much of personal email space would we really be using? Isn't 1GB or even 100MB a bit too much? To gain a better perspective on this, imagine that till a week back Yahoo premium users were getting 25MB for about $19.99! Now, there is a 4 time explosion of previously premium mail space available for free!  Me, not being such an avid mailer would possibly end up using about 10 to 15 MB max. And am sure, most of us fall into this category. So, is the wrong battle being fought? I may be totally wrong here, but as the Mahabharatha says, 'There is no  muni  who has not had an opinion of his own' :-)  The sheer size of these accounts 100MB and 1GB makes them like a virtual drive. So, what would anyone expect from a virtual drive? Find things in them as fast as possible. So, this opens up the pandora's box of Cataloging and searching. Gmail is purported to do most of this. But, all information I have about gmail is second hand as I don't have a gmail account. I do have an yahoo account and their search in mails is still primitive. It lets a full text search, but with that much space means that many more mails. So, unless they improve the cataloging and searching, I don't see this going anywhere.   It is just some bloated email space for me unless they do smart stuff like possibly customized bayesian filtering and meta data management for cataloging. Is the email space going to become a content management space? Maybe, it really is a personal content management space with RSS reading and blogging capabilites inbuilt. Some food for thought.

						   Ran across an article in the recent edition of the Scientific American. It proposed solutions for the patent  system reform. The Patent system has been much maligned for issuing patents that are neither novel nor practical.   The patenting blunders are especially visible in the software industry as the capacity to innovate (or term something as innovation) are very very high. The USPTO may not be equipped to handle this overwhelming number of patent requests.   As Sir Tim Berners Lee (Inventor of the WWW) clearly states in this  urlLink article ,  "It's really important that they put tremendous restrictions on or complete abolition of software patents"  . If Sir Tim Berners Lee had decided to patent his idea in 1989, the growth of the www would have been stunted and we may never have had an unifying internet! Scary thought that.  Take a look at these recent patents of  urlLink Microsoft  and  urlLink IBM . If two of the biggest names in the personal and enterprise computing industry go about patenting such triviality. Then, you never know what's gonna happen as the days go by.   Another such blimey by the USPTO is possibly the infamous Amazon   " urlLink one-click"    patent. Although there was no pre-existing patent or paper, it gave amazon.com exclusive rights to a practice that was widely used in the software industry at that time.  According to the Scientific American article, two economists Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University and Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School are coming up with a book   urlLink Innovation And Its Discontents: How Our Broken Patent System Is Endangering Innovation and Progress, and What to Do About It    that brings out the shortcomings of the existing system and suggests ideas for revamping it.   Their suggestions in brief that I picked from the article are,  * Most patents considered "economically unimportant" would get only a cursory examination as they wouldn't raise many objections. Excepting those cases would let examiners spend more time on the critical cases. * After the examiner decides that a patent can be issued, a "pre-grant opposition" process would begin that allowed others to point to "prior art" indicating that the patent is not innovative or inventive. * Even if a prior art cannot be found and patent is granted, it may still not meet the requisite obviousness standard e.g. the amazon "one-click" patent. So, a review and re-examination procedure needs to be in place to avoid such blunders. * Even after all these, bad patents would still be granted. The authors suggest that judges, not juries rule in these cases, increasing likelihood that plaintiffs would get a fair hearing.  These may not be the best solution on offer and everyone may not be in agreement with them. But, what everyone agrees is that the patent system needs to be revamped. Otherwise, there may arise extreme situations like in the netherlands, where the patenting system was abolished between 1869 and 1910 because it was issuing patents for everything. Most open source advocates would definitely love that when it comes to software patents :-)

						   The idea to blog has been on my mind for a long time. But, never got myself to physically blog something. Have been mentally doing that for a very long time. Over phone one day, my dear friend  urlLink Karthik  who is an Usabiliy Analyst, suggested that I should start blogging. He had initially insisted that I set up a site. But, maintaining a site is too much overhead. It is much easier to blog which I feel is almost like a scribble pad where you jot down your thoughts as and when they arise. One thing I've really noticed and it may be just me, is that as time goes by the your thoughts/ideas tend to fade away and you start feeling that whatever remains may not be worth jotting down.   Then came across this  urlLink interesting article   by Bob Cringley of PBS. His thoughts are very interesting as to how the Blog is a personal posting and could be used for personal data mining at a later date. That's a very unique way of looking at the art of blogging. It really doesn't matter if the subject you are blogging interests others as long as it captivates you.   It's a personal diary on a public space. So better ensure that are no sensitive or personal details down here. Check out this  urlLink article  about how blogging and RSS can be used in the education space. We are already using a web logging/wiki tool at work for colloborative work and it has been really useful.   The first time is always the most difficult. Hopefully will be blogging more frequently in the future. But, I've always been a sinecure. So, you never know. Let's see how it goes.
