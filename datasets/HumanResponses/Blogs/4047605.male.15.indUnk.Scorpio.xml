       Sick today, but went out with Weiling today... And definately felt better... Won Cindy at pool again. WeeEe. haha... Did a E Maths full paper today, got 69/80 for Paper 1, 68/100 for paper 2. Overall is 77. Not bad, but I really need improvement in Geometry figures and Loci. Hmmm.. 1 week and 2 days had passed after that sad incident, but I at least starting to get over it.. Hope all my friends will too. =) Going for another paper, after listening to Jay's new song, Qi Li Xiang. Sent by Terence. Greatest buddy on Earth. =)

       Seriously I didn't know or cared about how this thing works, but when I was walking home from school today, 27/07/04, I suddenly thought of Blogspot.com. amazing? No idea. Anyways, I'm just testing how this works. =)

      I was playing basketball in the evening, eventually I suffered an injury in a part of the game, then I had to rest. Later, I was looking at a game, for 2 guys and 4 girls, evenly spread. Then some guys were making jokes of a guy, who looked like a girl, had the soft look and stuff. Heard he nearly cried. Then we made friends after the game, basically in a even game, that is. All I want to tell him is that,  Bother not of what people say, Bother not of what people feel. For you are living for yourself, Not for anyone else. Do well, and ask them. If I am what you call a sissy, Then what are you if you lose to me? Faggot? Pure Girl? Lesbian? Hmmm. Ain't it true? So I ask, does it hurt more to do well for yourself, Or to be called that, for a lifetime?

      Weee. The results are finally out. Maybe I can pass a sigh now, at least I've managed a B4. =) Oh well, I'm contented with that! =) I was actually thinking that a C5 or C6 would be alright, but B4 is definately great! =P Well, for those who didn't get their expected grades.. Don't be sad. There's always next time! =)

      Damn, I feel so restless nowadays! I can't possibly afford to do so! Oh well, guess I'll really need to buck up. Skipped lessons because I felt restless... Damn. I need the motivation! Hmmm. Watched the 5 worst dunks in history.  #5 Cedric Ceballos in 1992, with a blindfold dunk. But the commentators doesn't believe it, because he knew where the pole was when he landed! Kinda makes sense, until another commentator said that the poles are always at the same spot.  #4 Tim Perry in 1993, windmill dunk. Single windmill dunk. Unenthuasitic. Enough said.  #3 Larry Lughes in 2000, not applicable. Some under the legs alley-oop dunk. In other words, baseball game. -- Strike One! Ball flies out of court -- Strike Two! Ball hits board, but flies over Larry. -- Strike Three! Ball hits board, but flies over Larry, AGAIN. You're OUT! NEXT!  #2 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf in 1993, 3 pointer whiff alley dunk. A three point whiff, attempts a mid-air windmill dunk! He's a good shooter! He's a good guy! Maybe he shouldn't have came. He hasn't got any dunks in, and he won't. Duh, it flew off the rim.  #1 Darrel Armstrong in 1996, Air Reverse. No wonder it is the "best". He's not alone! He runs in and jumps... and went for a lay-up? NO! You can't do a lay-up in a dunk contest!!!

Chemistry Test and Additional Mathematics Mock Exam on Thursday, History Mock Exam on Friday. After the National Day Celebration. Damn. I'll rather I do my work then. Haix. Nvm.. Haha. I So feel like studying nowadays. Tension? Pressure? Stress? Nope. It's cause I'm bored stiff. haha. =D

       If I were to ask you,   What is the worst thing you've regretted.   What would you say?   For not asking a babe or hunk for her/his number?   For not doing something at a certain point of your life?   Maybe that's what most people would say,   Without thinking much, of what's really regretting.   But I would say.   If the clock can go backwards. I shall hesitate not to give up things for the occurence.   If time can go back,   I would untie all knots present.   All unfamilarity being appeared in other's faces.   To let everyone who knows me know that,   It is never too hard to live on.   Its harder to give up.   To give up, would show everything being erased.   All efforts.   All memories.   From everyone.   For a person to accept such a deal,   Seems easy at first,   But is never.   To hold yourself together,   To walk on the path of life together,   Hand in Hand with each other,   Is the way of life.   Life is always possible.   God won't give us a dead end.   Life is a road.   A journey.   That wouldn't simply end as it wishes.   Yean Choi.   I hope you can rest in peace.   Despite the decision made,   I hold no qualms about it.   But we are indeed sad about it.   We'll remember you, for a long long time.   Take a good rest,   My Friend.

      Finally! My dad has gave me a Nokia 6600! weEeEEe. So happy. But my pre-paid card has no money! =\ Hmmm,  just hope my mom tops it up. Hmmm, did my household chores, Maybe go get a bath, and start my work at 2. Hmmm... But 6600 definately doesn't like me. I don't know how to operate the Predictive Text, but at least I figured the Shortcut keys after a day. =) Well, having tuition at 5p.m. later. Ok, Bath time! =D Hope more good things happen. =)  Smile Always!                                                                                                                                     -Azide
