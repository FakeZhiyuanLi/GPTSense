      So if I'm going to run this blog along the same lines as John Irvings classic, I'd better start from the beginning..  I was born Paul Ian Dickson on Wednesday 1st February 1978, in the Maternaity Ward of Good Hope Hospital, in Sutton Coldfield, England.  Well I guess this is a start..

      So England let us down again! England lose bottle with minutes to go!  Heskey doesn't deserve to wear the England shirt...  All the above I've heard this morning from various sources and to be honest to all of these comments have laughed away and told the relevent people to take their head oput their arse and actually look at what happened.  England held off the current holder for 89 minutes, played some of the best defensive football you're likely to see in this or any other footy tournament, players who were questioned before the game proved they are up to the challenge i.e. King, Lampard, Rooney!  It's one game and come on, who seriously thought we would get anything from the French?  OK, so we really should have held on for a few more minutes, but with the likes of Zidane and Henry in their side, England aquitted themselve brilliantly, not giving them a sniff until the last few minutes.  It was only through pure brilliance from Zidane (Beckham probably only one other who could take a free kick like that) and goalkeeping errors (yes I put it down to James for not positioning himself for the freekick and turning his back on Henry for the penalty) that we actually lost.  Bring on the Swiss and the Croats and then the French again in the final!!  Enuff footy talk for now, more blog later..  Dicko

      Hey peaps,  A few of you may have seen this a few weeks ago, but as this is going out to generally the whole world, I though it would be good to use as a starter blog...  They say a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but that’s all very well and good but what if you can't take that step?  Imagine if you will, that the day begins and ends with you staring at the ceiling, stuck lying on your back unable to move.  You see out the corner of your eye, doctors and nurses passing by, relatives coming and going.  All day long you hear the laughter, the crying, the sound of relief, the beeping and whirring of life dependent machines.  Alas, you’re stuck in a bed with only the ability to lightly squeeze the hand of a son or daughter during visiting hours.  The only activities you can achieve are the thoughts going round in your mind; the dreams of going home.      You could do more, you know you could do more but the geniuses in white coats know best.  You want to tell them to get you out of this god-forsaken bed, but who will listen when the words you want to say are not forthcoming? The drugs are pumped in and you are told they are making you better, but you still can’t raise your hand for that thirst quenching glass.  You could do more, you know you could do more, but where do you find the will when all around have given up?  Then it hits you, that realisation that unless you do something about the situation, you’re going to be left counting holes in the ceiling panels above.  The decision has to be made; are you going to give up or prove the bastards wrong?  You look for some divine intervention, but that has got lost along the line and you are left searching deep down inside for some lost strength.    Sometime later you are lifting your hand to grasp that glass of water.  You still can’t get out of the bed, but you have beaten the desire to give up.  One day, your feet will feel the icey cold tiles of the hospital ward and who knows, maybe take that walk home!  In the face of adversity and in your loneliest and darkest hour, remember the strength that you have inside you.  Only you and you alone, can show the world the strength and spirit you have in order to achieve your dreams.  Then the world will stand up and take notice and who knows, maybe give you a hand to complete your journey!  Inspirationl maybe, but these thoughts just pop into my head at certain times, so be prepared for sporadic blogs..this could be fun ;o)
