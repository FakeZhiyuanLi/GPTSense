      A bitch that mother's a baby monkey! Meerut | May 24, 2004 5:50:58 PM IST   Giving an all together new meaning to motherhood, a bitch in a remote village near Meerut, has been mothering a baby monkey for the past five-six months.  The baby monkey, whose hind limbs became disfunctional due to some unexplained disease, is taken by the bitch as its own child and he actually survives on her milk.  The bitch takes utmost care of the baby monkey, which can easily be seen piggy-riding on her back, through out the day.  This unusual relationship between animals that are known to be hostile to each other is nothing short of a miracle.  Villagers here say they had tried taking the baby monkey away from the bitch to their home, but failed as the monkey was not ready to leave its adopted mother.  "This baby monkey lives with the bitch only. Though we had tried many times to take him to our place, he is just not ready to leave the bitch. He has been living with her for long and has grown up feeding on her milk," said one villager. (ANI)

      Finally!!!  Man, all these years of deep thoughts and long restless nights have finally come to an end.        The peculiar shape and size of a moose's nose produce advantages, zoologists have found.   Bullwinkle's model has nostrils that can be 10 centimetres wide, with a snout that hangs over the lip.    The nose of a moose is unique   The moose's nose differs from its cousins like deer but scientists knew little about why.   To find out, Lawrence Witmer, an anatomy professor at the University of Ohio, and his graduate student Andy Clifford examined the heads of moose roadkill from Canada.   After dissecting the samples and using CT scans to probe internal anatomy, they found specialized muscles and cartilage in the moose's nose.   "These attributes suggest a mechanical function, namely, an elaborated nostril-closing system," they wrote in the April issue of the Journal of Zoology.   Moose are strong swimmers that can plunge 5.5 metres and surface with aquatic plants. The nostril mechanism may help keep out water, the researchers said.      And here I thought it was because they did a lot of cocaine.

      Seventh Level of Hell  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Guarded by the Minotaur, who snarls in fury, and encircled within the river Phlegethon, filled with boiling blood, is the Seventh Level of Hell. The violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment. The stench here is overpowering. This level is also home to the wood of the suicides- stunted and gnarled trees with twisting branches and poisoned fruit. At the time of final judgement, their bodies will hang from their branches. In those branches the Harpies, foul birdlike creatures with human faces, make their nests. Beyond the wood is scorching sand where those who committed violence against God and nature are showered with flakes of fire that rain down against their naked bodies. Blasphemers and sodomites writhe in pain, their tongues more loosed to lamentation, and out of their eyes gushes forth their woe. Usurers, who followed neither nature nor art, also share company in the Seventh Level.

I mean it will probably be too crowded to get any sort of glimpse of the sex-driven political figure.  Does anybody know if Hillary will be there?  Thats' who I'd want to see, who cares about a man who can't keep his cock contained?  I sure don't.  I want to see the woman who will (hopefully) become the first female president.

      Judge Regrets Comparing Bush to Hitler  Friday, June 25, 2004 7:45 a.m. ET  By Gail Appleson  NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals judge on Thursday apologized for comparing the way President Bush took office after the disputed 2000 election to the rise of dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.  Guido Calabresi, a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, sent a letter to his chief judge expressing "my profound regret" for the comments made at a legal conference in Washington on Saturday.  Calabresi's remarks at an American Constitution Society Conference were reported by the New York Sun on Monday.  "(Bush) came to power as a result of the illegitimate acts of a legitimate institution that had the right to put somebody in power. That is what the Supreme Court did in Bush versus Gore. It put somebody in power," the judge said.  "The reason I emphasize that is because that is exactly what happened when Mussolini was put in by the king of Italy," Calabresi was quoted as saying. "The king of Italy had the right to put Mussolini in, though he had not won an election, and make him prime minister. That is what happened when Hindenburg put Hitler in."       Calabresi told the lawyers that he was not suggesting "for a moment that Bush is Hitler. I want to be clear on that, but it is a situation which is extremely unusual."  On Thursday, Calabresi apologized.  "My remarks were extemporaneous and, in hindsight, reasonably could be -- and indeed have been -- understood to do something which I did not intend, that is, take a partisan position," Calabresi, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said in a letter given to reporters.  Calabresi's letter was addressed to John Walker Jr., chief judge of the circuit and a cousin to former President George H.W. Bush.  Reporters were also given a memo Walker sent to other circuit judges informing them of the apology and urging them to be careful about comments that could be construed as political during an election year.  In his letter, Calabresi said he believed judges should not publicly support political candidates and he had intended his comments as academic argument.  Calabresi said he was "truly sorry" and that he was apologizing "profusely" for the episode.

      And the Award for the Most Potent Pot Goes To...  Monday, June 28, 2004 9:49 a.m. ET  LISBON (Reuters) - Cannabis in the Netherlands is almost twice as strong as in the rest of the European Union, where the drug's potency has remained stable, the EU drugs agency said on Friday.  Politicians' worries over the health risks of stronger cannabis prompted the Lisbon-based European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction to examine marijuana and hashish available in the bloc.  "Today's report shows that effective potency of cannabis in nearly all EU countries has remained quite stable for many years," the center said.  The potency of cannabis in most EU countries has remained at about six to eight percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active ingredient.  The only exception was in the Netherlands, where potency had reached 16 percent by 2001-02, mostly because of supplies of intensively produced home-grown cannabis.  However, this did not affect the EU average since most cannabis consumed there was produced outside the bloc.

      Sex-Laced Mozart Raises Scandal Monday, June 28, 2004 9:56 a.m. ET   By James Mackenzie  BERLIN (Reuters) - An opera featuring rape, torture and masturbation, a nude bass singing an aria in the shower and a cross-dressing hero who rounds off the night by slaughtering a troupe of semi-naked prostitutes has caused a scandal in Berlin.  Mozart's "Die Entfuehrung aus dem Serail" (The Abduction from the Seraglio), one of the 18th century Austrian composer's most popular operas, is usually played as a sparkling comedy of relationships set in the grounds of a mythical Turkish palace.  The new production in Berlin's Komische Oper moves the action to a modern-day brothel where a brutal pimp keeps the women in his power through systematic rape and torture.  The opera's Catalan director, Calixto Bieito, who has seen previous productions greeted with leaflets proclaiming "Death to Bieito!" wanted to use the opera to cast a light on the plight of women exploited in the sex trade.  But the production has sparked outraged articles in the press and an initial threat from DaimlerChrysler, one of the main sponsors, to withdraw funding. Performances have been interrupted at various points by shouts from the floor as patrons have walked out in disgust.      "How filthy can theater be?" asked Germany's top selling daily newspaper Bild.  In between bouts of simulated sex with the prostitutes who lounge about the set, one of the characters urinates on stage and slashes a helpless woman as another looks on in terror.  The heroine Konstanza cowers in a cage as the villainous Selim Pasha sticks his hand down her pants and makes a series of repulsive threats in spoken asides inserted into the text.  Meanwhile her beloved Belmonte arms himself with a handgun and, helped by his tattooed manservant, slides into high boots and a tight dress to infiltrate the brothel.  On opening night, a voice from the audience answered the explosion of gunfire as Belmonte slays first the prostitutes and then their keepers with the cry "Now for the director!"  But supporters point out that behind Mozart's dazzling score, the text of the opera is a very dark one laced with threats of beheading and impalement and the production makes a powerful point about violence, oppression and sex.  Performances have been well attended since the run opened last week and warmly applauded by those who did not walk out, with several people bringing along opera glasses to follow the action more closely

      Now I guess they really are just a bit slower than Americans, which is saying quite a lot.     Voters Urged Not to Eat Their Ballots     Monday, June 28, 2004 12:03 p.m. ET     VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Canadians went to the polls in a federal election on Monday with a firm warning from election officials: Please do not eat your ballots.  "Eating a ballot, not returning it or otherwise destroying or defacing it constitutes a serious breach of the Canada Elections Act," Elections Canada warns on its Internet site.  The issue was of sufficient concern to warrant inclusion in the site's "Frequency asked Questions" section, above answers to such inquiries as "Why should I vote?" and "Am I registered?"  Three Alberta men were charged with eating their paper ballots during Canada's last federal election, in 2000. The members of the Edible Ballot Society were protesting against what they said was a lack of real choice among candidates.

      Here are my test results from the laziness test that I took on Sparknotes.  At least I'm not over 50% lazy.  And what exactly does this mean?  Does the left half of my body just not want to do anything while my right rounds around all day wanting to do shit?  I guess the real question is, "Who really gives a shit anyways?"    Congratulations! You finished the test!  You can't be that lazy, can you? Taking that into account, you are officially...  50% Lazy! That's higher than the worldwide average of 38%!  Compared to others...         88% less lazy than you — 2% as lazy as you — 10% blah blah blah...  Of the 2,557,370 test takers so far...    The average test-taker gets 8 hours of sleep a night   watches 4 hours of TV and plays 2 hours of videogames a day   and takes showers 7 times a week.   Trust fund kids are LESS likely to own a beer hat.   Vegetarians are MORE likely to think about the future.

      CHENEY CUSSES OUT QUEEN ELIZABETH  Drops F-bomb Twelve Times During U.K. Visit  Vice President Dick Cheney scandalized the United Kingdom today, cussing out Queen Elizabeth II in what observers said was his most profanity-laden tirade to date.  Mr. Cheney was at Buckingham Palace to witness the knighting of legendary British journalist Harold Evans when the Queen made what one source called “a snarky remark” about the vice president’s relationship with the Halliburton Company.  At that point, observers said, Mr. Cheney “launched the f-bomb” at the Queen no fewer than a dozen times, shocking the dignitaries attending Sir Harold’s investiture.  “Mind your own [bleeping] business, you [bleeping] old [bleep],” Mr. Cheney was quoted as saying.  “Cheney has the mouth of a sailor, which is odd for someone who did everything he could to stay out of the Navy,” one observer said.  But according to Charles, the Prince of Wales, after Mr. Cheney’s f-bomb barrage was over the Queen stood her ground and returned fire with a potty-mouthed attack of her own.  “When it comes to cussing, my mother’s language can peel paint,” Prince Charles proudly told reporters. “After all, she learnt at the feet of the master – the Queen Mother. That old bag could drop the f-bomb with the best of them, may she rest in peace.”  The filthy war of words between the Queen and the vice president was carried live on worldwide television, meaning that both dignitaries could now face FCC fines topping well over $1 billion.  Mr. Cheney took the fines in stride, telling reporters that they would be paid for with revenue from Iraqi oil.

      Its Sunday morning, and I'm probably gonna sleep soon.  My boy is already there so I think I should probably join him.  Had a nice relaxing day lounging about the apartment half-naked.  It was really nice to have a weekend where we were able to that.  Oh, life without a roommate, how wonderfully fantastic.    Tomorrow is pride, which we may or may not go to.  Either way, I hope we are able to score some smokable delights. Anyhow off to bed, goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow.

      Moore's docu-film opens today, and I sure wish I had bought tickets earlier.  I will probably see it with my boy sometime this week however.  Worked sucked today.  The supposed "day leader", whatever the fuck that means, once again did next to nothing today.  Oh, except make lots of personal calls instead of actual work.    Last night was really sweet though, I went to see Hairspray with Busty and my boy.  It was a really good show and a good time was had by all, although I kind of wished I had done some cocaine with Busty.  That would of made the night that much better.  I guess the weed was more than adequate for the evening.  Yes, I realize its Friday night and I'm at home writing another blog posting, but I am spending time with my boy and there's nothing more I could of asked for.  He actually just walked in the room and is scratching my back... oooh chills.... kisses?

I wish we had some marijuana though, not the little bit that we were saving, which we in fact smoked last night before bed.  Man, I wish I could find my extra film, I know I have it around here somewhere....  GRRRRRR.... guess there's no point in worrying now.  My baby is abouts to get out of the shower than I believe we're off for our fun adventure! I hope he doesn't mind too much, I really appreciate him going.  I'm glad just to get out of the house really, and with my boy!  Anyhow gots to run have fun out there everyone or noone.  Toodles.

      What?!?    Yes, let's allow one of the most restrictive middle eastern countries to take the lead position for Muslim forces.  Saudi Arabia is just as horrible if not worse than the Taliban regime.  Both of which gained much of their power from the US both militarily and economically.  I mean I suppose it makes sense considering the Bush family's lust for Saudi oil.  I guess its just that I always hold this kind of naive hope that Baby Bush is a descent enough human being to stop with all his fucking bullshit.  I hope I don't get shit for this, but in many ways I respect the so-called "terrorists" more than I do infamous leader.  Compare the number of US casualties in this new Iraq War with how many civilians we've murdered.  US power in the world relies largely upon one simple fact:  we have by far the most powerful and destructive military in the history of the world.   And what does this get us?  Anything. If you don't cooperate with the US (more specifically US corporations), we will bomb the shit out of you.  Even if it means sacrificing thousands of our  young adults [which ,(un)coincidently, often ends up being poor or any ethnicity other than white]    Shame on us.

      Just got back from an extended weekend in LALA land. Or just outside of LALA land to be more precise. Pomona to be exact. Visiting my sister and her family. All that really happened was me watching a shit load of movies. I Robot, Dodgeball, Last Samurai, Catwoman, and bourne Identity (In the order that I like them). I was surprised that I even liked I Robot, but I did, and it was a pretty good movie to boot. In addition to all the movies that I watched, most with my boy although he opted out of I Robot and Dodgeball, we also went to Venice Beach. It was here that my boy bought the replacement for Swirly, his first pipe. Which he had to replace since I accidentally smashed Swirly against the concrete floor of my sister's garage while we were smoking before Catwoman. The replacement, which I like better than Swirly, we got at a steal, so that was cool. We also got some incense and a new incense burner, which my boy was excited about. We decided to drive back Saturday night after the drive-in, and although my boy said he was cool with driving, I had to take over after almost two hours and drove the rest of the way. We got in a little before 7am, which isn't making bad time, since we left around 1:30am. Anyhow, I needs to look for a job now. Hope everyone else had a great weekend.

      Oh, how AI has such great things to say about the good ole USA.         In July, Joseph Amrine was released after more than 16 years on Missouri's death row for the murder of a fellow prisoner. He had been convicted on the basis of testimony from other inmates which was later retracted. Joseph Amrine became the 111th person to be released from death row in the USA since 1973 on the grounds of innocence. The 112th such case occurred in December, when a Pennsylvania prosecutor announced that he would not retry Nicholas Yarris who had been on the state's death row for two decades. A federal judge had ordered a new trial after DNA testing supported Nicholas Yarris' claim of innocence.

         In Colombia as a whole, grave violations of human rights and breaches of international humanitarian law by all parties to the long-running internal armed conflict  the armed forces, armybacked paramilitaries and armed opposition groups  remained widespread. In 2003, more than 3,000 civilians were killed for political motives and at least 600 "disappeared". Around 2,200 people were kidnapped, more than half by armed opposition groups and army-backed paramilitaries. The civilian population continued to bear the brunt of the armed conflict. The government and security forces stepped up their campaign to undermine the legitimacy of human rights defenders, peace activists and trade unionists.      And who could be funding the government in their campaigns?          International Criminal Court           On 6 October, the US government released US$5 million in military aid to Colombia after the Colombian government entered into an impunity agreement not to surrender US nationals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes to the International Criminal Court. Such agreements are in breach of states' obligations under international law.          Military aid           In the fiscal year 2003 the USA sent an estimated US$605 million in military and police assistance to Colombia. Most of the aid was earmarked for "counter-terrorism" and "international narcotics control" purposes. The requirement that the US State Department certify progress on human rights was retained. However, this applied to only 25 per cent of US assistance, down from 100 per cent in 2002.

         Human rights concerns during the war             Hundreds of civilians were killed during the war by US and UK forces. Some were victims of cluster bombs, others were killed in disputed circumstances. Unexploded bomblets from cluster bombs posed a threat to civilians, particularly children.          On 31 March US soldiers opened fire on an unidentified vehicle as it approached a US checkpoint near al-Najaf. Ten of the 15 passengers, including five children, were killed.      On 1 April at least 33 civilians, including many children, were reportedly killed and around 300 injured in US attacks allegedly involving cluster bombs on the town of al-Hilla, southeast of Baghdad.           Human Rights Abuse After the War          Excessive use of force         Scores of civilians were killed apparently as a result of excessive use of force by US troops or were shot dead in disputed circumstances.            US troops shot dead or injured scores of Iraqi demonstrators in several incidents. For example, seven people were reportedly shot dead and dozens injured in Mosul on 15 April; at least 15 people were shot dead, including children, and more than 70 injured in Fallujah on 29 April; and two demonstrators were shot dead outside the Republican Palace in Baghdad on 18 June.      On 14 May, two US armed vehicles broke through the perimeter wall of the home of Sa'adi Suleiman Ibrahim al-'Ubaydi in Ramadi. Soldiers beat him with rifle butts and then shot him dead as he tried to flee.      US forces shot 12-year-old Mohammad al-Kubaisi as they carried out search operations around his house in the Hay al-Jihad area in Baghdad on 26 June. He was carrying the family bedding to the roof of his house when he was shot. Neighbours tried to rush him by car to the nearby hospital, but US soldiers stopped them and ordered them to go back. By the time they reached his home, Mohammad al-Kubaisi was dead. CPA officials told AI delegates in July that Mohammad al-Kubaisi was carrying a gun when he was killed.      On 17 September a 14-year-old boy was killed and six people were injured when US  troops opene d fire at a wedding party in Fallujah. The soldiers reportedly believed they were under attack when shots were fired in the air in celebration.      On 23 September, three farmers, 'Ali Khalaf, Sa'adi Faqri and Salem Khalil, were killed and three others injured when US troops opened a barrage of gunfire reportedly lasting for at least an hour in the village of al-Jisr near Fallujah. A US military official stated that the troops came under attack but this was vehemently denied by relatives of the dead. Later that day, US military officials reportedly went to the farmhouse, took photographs and apologized to the family.         Incommunicado detention         People held in prisons and detention centres run by Coalition forces  such as Camp Cropper in Baghdad International Airport (which closed in October), Abu Ghraib Prison and the detention centres in Habbaniya Airport and Um Qasr  were invariably denied access to family or lawyers and any form of judicial review of their detention. Some were held for weeks or months; others appeared to be held indefinitely.         Torture or ill-treatment         Torture or other ill-treatment by Coalition forces was frequently reported. Detainees suffered extreme heat while housed in tents and were supplied with insufficient water, inadequate washing facilities, open trenches for toilets, no change of clothes, and no books, newspapers, radios or writing materials. Detainees were routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during arrest and the first 24 hours of detention. Plastic handcuffs used by US troops caused detainees unnecessary pain. Former detainees stated they were forced to lie face down on the ground, were held handcuffed, hooded or blindfolded, and were not given water or food or allowed to go to the toilet. Allegations of torture and ill-treatment by US and UK troops during interrogation were received. Methods reported included prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. There were frequent reports of abuses by US forces during house searches, including allegations of looting and wanton destruction of property. Virtually none of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment was adequately investigated.          Abdallah Khudhran al-Shamran, a Saudi Arabian national, was arrested in al-Rutba in early April by US and allied Iraqi forces while traveling from Syria to Baghdad. On reaching an unknown site, he said he was beaten, given electric shocks, suspended by his legs, had his penis tied and was subjected to sleep deprivation. He was held there for four days before being transferred to a camp hospital in Um Qasr. He was then interrogated and released without money or passport. He approached a British soldier, whereupon he was taken to another place of detention, then transferred to a military field hospital and again interrogated and tortured. This time torture methods included prolonged exposure in the sun, being locked in a container, and being threatened with execution.      Nine Iraqis arrested on 14 September by the British military in Basra were reportedly tortured. The men all worked for a hotel in Basra where weapons were reported to have been found. Baha' al-Maliki, the hotel's receptionist, died in custody three days later; his body was reportedly severely bruised and covered in blood. Kefah Taha was admitted to hospital in critical condition, suffering renal failure and severe bruising.

      So, apparently the illegitimate "President", George "Yes, I'm a cokehead" Bush, wants to be a "peace" president. He's been spouting off the words peace and peaceful as if saying them somehow makes it true. It's pathetic. Truly. He's also claiming that the United States is now a safer place then it was before the was with Iraq. That's like saying a drive-by will stop the violence in a gang war. Umm, hello its called retaliation. When most foreign policy makers (whose interests don't lie with Bush &amp; co.) agree that the war with Iraq without a doubt will only lead to the proliferation of WMD and an arms race for all the countries out there who are terrified of this country. Again, I am ashamed to be an American.

      I am pretty ashamed to be an American these days or any day in fact. National pride is a joke. Our policies ,manifest destiny and the Monroe Doctrine to name a few, have led us down a dark and disturbing path. We crush the people's will of foreign countries in the name of money and greed. Panama, Iraq, Columbia, Cuba, Angola, Iran, Lebanon, Brazil, Vietnam, the Philippines, on and on the list goes of countries we have fucked. Royally fucked. None of our Presidents have shown any interest in withdrawing from our quest for world domination. Not Clinton, not JFK. No Republican or Democrat. No one. We are a soul's, evil nation. Overjoyed in our gluttony and greed. What we need is a revolution and a new path.

      Once again I was clicking my way through varoius news sites, when i stumbled across an article about Saddam's trial.  And it has finally confirmed my suscpicions that the whole thing is a big sham.  I've copied the part the kind of upset me the most.     "What the world now expects Saddam to reveal in court ... is hitherto unheard details of how the U.S. perhaps nudged him into invading Iran in 1980 and ... kept his military replenished with weapons and technology that helped him sustain the war for eight years while serving the American goal of destroying Iran's firepower that was deemed a threat to the region and, eventually, [to] Israel." (Jordan Times)   If, though, "every time he's accused of some horrible act," Saddam does "blame the West for being behind most of the dreadful events that took place under his reign," he may well "have a point," wrote noted commentator Neil Mackay in Scotland's Sunday Herald. After all, "Britain and America armed Saddam with weapons of mass destruction during the 1980s, and the U.S. encouraged him to hammer the Iranians. The U.S. hated the revolutionary fundamentalist regime that took control of Tehran in 1979 and [was] determined to do anything to undermine it -- including allowing Saddam ... to unleash chemical weapons against the Iranians."   Indeed, Iran's Mehr News Agency reported, during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, "the current U.S. defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, [who then served as a special envoy of the Reagan administration,] met with Saddam in Baghdad, assuring him of U.S. backing." A news analyst for Lebanon's Daily Star cited a 2002 Washington Post news story that reported that, at the time, the United States knew Saddam "was using chemical weapons on an 'almost daily' basis in defiance of international conventions." The newspaper also noted that the Reagan administration authorized the sale to Iraq of poisonous chemicals and deadly biological viruses that had military uses. (Washington Post, quoted in the Daily Star)   But why did Washington want to support Saddam in what turned out to be a long, miserable war with little victory to speak of on either side? According to The Daily Star's analysis, "The U.S. [had] removed Iraq from the State Department's terrorism list in 1982, two years after the start of the ... Iran-Iraq war. Washington sought a rapprochement with Saddam after ... Reagan's administration perceived a possible Iranian victory over Iraq as a destabilizing factor in the [Persian] Gulf, which would [have] threaten[ed] U.S. oil supplies."   Now Iran's government is angry that, at his arraignment, Saddam was charged with numerous crimes (BBC), including the gassing of Kurds in northern Iraq in 1988 and invading Kuwait in 1990, but not for starting the war with Iran.   Iran's former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said, "If the Iraqi court refuses to include [Saddam's responsibility for] unleashing ... the war against Iran, it means it is [doing so] on an order from the Americans. Why is the war against Kuwait, which only lasted several months, among the major charges, while the war against Iran, which lasted eight years, is omitted?" (Daily Star)      It is obvious that the Bush administration is just saving its own fucking ass.  I mean couldn't they put Rumsfield and Bush Sr. on trial for the whole Iran-Iraq War.  Weren't we the ones supplying the weapons and encouraging the whole thing!?!  I am deeply ashamed.

      Talking Tombstones Bear a Message from the Grave  LONDON (Reuters) - The dead could soon be speaking from the grave if an American inventor's plan becomes reality.  Robert Barrows, of Burlingame, California has filed a patent application for a video-equipped tombstone that will display a video message from grave's occupant.   "If his patent is granted, Barrows hopes that when people make out their will, they also leave a parting video with their lawyer," New Scientist magazine said on Wednesday.   The hollow, talking tombstone will include a flat touch screen and will house a computer with a microchip memory or hard disc. It will be powered by electricity from the cemetery's lighting system.   The plan will not be the first electronically enhanced tombstone. An American company has a patent on a gravestone that will display photographs of the deceased and tributes from friends, according to the magazine.   But the Barrows plan will go one further by including contributions actually from the deceased.   "It's history from the horse's mouth," he said.

      So, I was going through news articles, when one kind of knocked me off my seat.  The headline, "U.S. Quietly Sneaks Once-Looted Uranium Out of Iraq," seemed a little shady.  I mean come on "quietly sneaks."  As I read the article, it became a little more appalling.  Apparently, after the first Gulf War, the Iraqis were ordered to dismantle their nuclear program including the Tuwaitha nuclear complex, which had served as the center of their nuclear program. But of nuclear materials remained there, under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, until the second Gulf War, when it was left unguarded by the U.S.-led invading forces and looted by Iraqi civilians.   I blinked, that was absurd.  Lets leave the material that could be used to make, if not actual nuclear weapons, "dirty" bombs.  Ever heard of a clean or tidy bomb?  They left unguarded 1.8 tons of uranium!  Once this startling lapse of anything remotely close to intelligence, our brilliant leaders decide maybe its a good idea to do something about it.  And so they removed the uranium to an undisclosed location minus 90 lbs. Hmm... I wonder who has it, so called terrorists or ,more probably, local youngsters.  What's the next step to fucking up an invasion of "freedom"?

      OK, so I didn't, but that didn't prevent me from taking the day off. and boy did I need it.  I'm just sick of going to work and being the only there who actually tries to make the department run smoothly and efficiently.  Other than work, my life has been grand.    I saw both Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spider-man 2. I was severly affected by Fahrenheit 9/11 that I was actually crying at the end.  Sometimes this country of ours really makes me sick.  I highly suggest, no demand, that everyone should see this movie.  Even if you support Bush (and if you do, you should probably check yourself into a psychiatric ward), the movie is enlightening and might make you question said support.    Spider-man 2 was ok, it was better than the first, but I still did't like it all that much.  Lots of bangs and whistles, but not much else. Not much else to say except that Tobey is kinda cute in all that spandex.  Oh yeah, I entirely approve of John Kerry's running mate, and I hope that he helps beat the hell out of Baby Bush.

      ASHCROFT: TERRORISTS PLANNING ‘SPECTACULAR’ GAY WEDDINGS   Gayer-than-usual Chatter Intercepted  Attorney General John Ashcroft today revealed that the Justice Department has collected “credible evidence” that terrorists may be planning “spectacular” gay weddings to coincide with the 4th of July holiday weekend.  “There is little doubt that these evildoers intend to hit us hard, the best way they know how – with spectacular, flamboyantly gay weddings,” Mr. Ashcroft said.  Mr. Ashcroft hastened to add that the Department of Justice did not know where or when the weddings might take place, adding, “When terrorists are planning gay weddings, they don’t send you an engraved invitation.”  But the Attorney General said that, according to chatter intercepted by Justice Department agents, “There can be no doubt that these gay weddings will be the gayest ever.”  Just minutes after Mr. Ashcroft concluded his remarks, however, Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge made a statement that seemed, on the surface at least, to contradict the Attorney General’s: “While there has been some increase in terrorist chatter, the chatter itself has been no gayer than usual.”  Mr. Ridge conceded that the intercepted terrorist chatter contained “some gay content,” such as effusive remarks about the actor Brad Pitt, but that Americans “should go about their 4th of July activities without worrying that a spectacular series of gay weddings is about to occur.”  In other news, Iraqi officials said that former dictator Saddam Hussein made five failed escape attempts since being transferred to Iraqi custody yesterday.  In one of the ill-conceived prison breaks described by the officials, the former Iraqi strongman attempted to distract his jailers’ attention by shouting, “Look, over there – it’s Paris Hilton!”
