      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In completing my position and research paper, I should be drawing on the work of other writers, this is the part when I must document their contributions. Which disciplines should I use?. APA or MLA?.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever it is I must make sure that I follow these 3 rules.   1.The sources is introduced by a signal phrase that names its author.  2.The material being cited is followed by a page number in parentheses.  3.At the end of the paper, a list of works cited gives complete publishing information about the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All those three rules are very useful, especially for my research paper...

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I am concentrating on my introduction, I think it is important to establish my own voice in the introduction.My opening paragraphs should introduce me as a writer as well as my ideas to the reader.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or two paragraphs are usually enough introduction for most paper in this course. I am sure, most readers do not want a great deal of background -&nbsp; they want to get right to the point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am hoping that by stating the thesis and showing its importance, an introduction should hook readers.Or should I use a kind of&nbsp;strategies &nbsp;that to pose a puzzling problem to connect my topic to the reader.... all these my be taken into consideration in writing an introduction for position and research paper. I am working on it.....

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,I am on the stage of drafting my position paper as well as my research paper...   With restricted thesis, a preliminary outline and plenty of notes, I am ready to write my first draft.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am doing right now is to keep it rough and keep it moving. I do not let my wish for perfect sentences stall me at this stage.From the ideas and supporting details, I will polish my sentences later. By writing rapidly, I think it might produces a more natural,individual voice and helps to avoid echoing the language of my sources.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing for sure, a chatty, breezy voice is usually not welcome in this academic papers.  As though I believe in my main point and are interested in my subject, I will try to communicate that sense of conviction.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last semester, we were doing a proposal paper for Prof.Kay course.... she did mentioned about primary and secondary sources.According to Prof.Kay, primary source is more reliable than a secondary source because it has the advantage of being a firsthand account.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In carrying out the task given either in position or research paper, I have to read with a 'critical eye'.I have to&nbsp;examine the assumptions, assessing its evidence and weighing its conclusions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ssometimes I came across some elements of argument and encounter experts who disagree with the sources I found. Here I have to read the sources arguments with special care and testing them with my own critical intelligence....now my note taking skills came in. In order to make life easier, I have to take notes as I read because it will help me to remember later as I am going to draft my position as well as my research paper.....

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am working on my research paper....In carrying out this task, time management plays a great role.I really need time to read... In searching of answers to a research question, I must read critically, meaning I have to process the information as well as assessing what I read.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With research questions in my mind, I seek the truth...How am I to seek the truth ?&nbsp;  Questioning poet's expertise?  Looking for possible flaws in the poet's reasoning?  Weighing the evidence?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes,&nbsp;I facing problems with the internet sources.Is all clues that are provided in the articles are worth tracking down?. Some of them provide abstracts or brief summaries which I need to question myself in tracking down a source.Some of the questions are; How relevant are they to my research?&nbsp; How long is the source? A very short article may be too general to be helpful...&nbsp;&nbsp; How valid are they?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now, I Have tracked down some sources, now is the time to make a preview....  How hectic it is.....

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a saying..."No gain no pain". I agree with that phrase ....&nbsp; the&nbsp;path to success is full of thorn!!  In getting a right track to present my&nbsp; thesis statement as well as the topic sentence,&nbsp;I have to think deeply whether or not ut will come in as a complete package without lacking anything anywhere.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The introduction of my topic sentence was not good because it is not clearly focus on the sensory device that I'm going to talk about.... the feedback I got from my lecturer.After doing some reflection&nbsp;I think I can sharpen the focus by clarifying what type of sensory devices that I am going&nbsp; to present, for example'sound'.If I were to talk about this device I must talk about it in one or two sentence(s) before providing all the evidences with an elaboration of it.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I too must take into consideration whether the introduction focuses clearly on the main point of the essay. In doing this, two questions lingering in my mind...  1. Does my intro let reaaders know what to expect as they read on ?  2.Does it make the significance of the subject clear so that readers will want to read on ?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope the rest of my position paper will fulfill the thesis statement need and accurately state the real point of the position paper.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am thinking on how to state the main point in a topic sentence.......I know that a paragraph should be unified around a main point and the point should be clear to me first then goes to readers.&nbsp;According to Diana Hacker, "a good topic sentence is one sentence summary of the paragraph's main point, acts as a signpost pointing in two directions: backward toward the thesis&nbsp;of the essay and forward the body of the paragraph."  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By looking at her definition, it is quite difficult to make a good topic sentence, but, in learning process, I have to follow the guidance as possible as I could.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first topic sentence will be like this. Owen describes the soldiers and the conditions they are in through our sight sense such as "Bent double, like old beggars under sacks".The readers can see how the soldiers are compared&nbsp;in a&nbsp;simile to old beggars, which is not the image of soldiers in respected uniforms which would be in keeping with the glorious image of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my topic sentence and the supporting detail given&nbsp;will suit the thesis statement that I formulated earlier.&nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were asked to make an outline from the thesis statement which were discussed in the class.My &nbsp;thesis statement for the position paper is "Sensory devices in 'Dulce Et Decorum Est'(DEDE) heighten the readers horror of war".We too, are being told to develop the points into two to three paragraphs.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to write this position paper, I have read and reread the poem for several times and posing questions and looking for the answers, all by myself.... alone. In informal way, most of us know how to read and respond to literature but when it comes&nbsp; to write it down, we have to take our informal judgements about a poem , (for instance) and through reflection and analysis, transform them into reasoned and arguments.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming back to 'DEDE' by Wilfred Owen, the sensory images used do appeal to the readers.The phrase,"He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning", gives the readers mind picture on&nbsp;how the soldiers were in terrible pain and how suffering they were. In line 22,"Come gargling from the froth corrupted lungs"is another example of sensory devices which can be disturbing to think about. It evokes emotions so as to cause people to become sick. By referring to those words ,&nbsp; it clearly stated to us the horror of war.&nbsp;

      This is my first enrty for EDU 3234 course. On the 8th of July 2004, we have had a long discussion on positon and research paper with Dr. Edwin, but the focuses are more on how to choose title and construct the thesis statement for both paper. As usual Dr. Edwin carried out brainstorming activity in order to tackle our understanding. According to my understanding, thesis statement should be strong, assertive summary of our own interpretation. Thesis statement of a literary paper cannot be too broad or too vague.   Some examples given by my lecturer's are :-  1. Women upliftment in society is through education.  2. Unfulfilment in marriages lead to infidelity.  3. Emily is a victim of a patrichal society.   I am still looking forward for my thesis statement for my position paper as being assigned by Dr. Edwin as a homework for this week. I think I would like to work on poems.   (112299)

               As I go on writing my position paper, I find out that there are many quotations to deal with...I think it is tempting to insert many long quotations in my paper and use my own words only for connecting passages.I do this because I feel the author of my sources are better writers than I am.But, I do not quote excessively... long series of quotation gives the impression that I cannot think for myself.I use direct quotations only when the sources is particularly clear or expressive.One thing for sure... most all of the time I used my own words to summarize and paraphrase my sources and to explain my ideas....Actually I  am still not satisfied with my position paper...

                I got some problem in linking one to another paragraph without discernible bumps,gaps or shifts.If I let the problem occur continously my sentences and paragraphs will not flow smoothly.So.. how am I to improve this skill?         After talking and discussing to some of my friends and doing some reading,I get to know some of the techniques...First rule, a topic sentence should tell readers whether the information they are about to read supports the thesis statement directly or supports a key idea in the essay which in turn support the thesis.Second rule,reprtition of key words is an important techniques for gaining coherence because if too much information seems new, a paragraph will be hard to read.To prevent repetitions from becoming dull we can use variations of a key word.         From those two rules, I'll try to connect my ideas briallantly especially in order to bind together text that looks too choppy.Another point that I must remember is by using certains words and phrases signal connections between ideas. For instance, to show addition; further,furthermore and moreover can be used AND if to indicate logical relationship, we can use therefore,consequently,thus or as a result. I will remember all those things to help me in writing my position as well as my research paper....
