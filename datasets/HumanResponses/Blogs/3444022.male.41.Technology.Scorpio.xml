      Rita woke up and said 'Masha', then 'Kasha'.  That was followed by a quick trip downstairs for some freshly made oatmeal kasha.  Current alphabet letters known: A, C, D, E, G, I, K, M, N, O, R, T, U, W.  Current words: Maisy, 'vsyo', mama, sun, 'devochka', fish, ash (dog, cat), 'aahh' (call for attention), 'aku dash', 'mush', 'atu', 'alyo' just like Ded Radik, circle, lo (for yellow), I lyu (for I love you), ko (milk).

      Rita turned 22 months today (may she live until 120 years).  Unfortunately today wasn't all good - she had her first major fall, with a swiped chin (which now looks like a red goatee). But she also counted by herself from 1 to 10!

      Rita was saying 'balya' or 'balays' today many times... until Marina and I figured out that that referred to butterflies.  Later on the playground she grabbed my sunglasses and said 'ochki' - which was the first time I heard it.  She's repeating a lot of words now, although most of them are either semi-right sounding or completely different (for example star is still referred to as 'tash' and diamond as 'dash').  The big news of the day was that we picked a kindergarten for Rita and she'll be starting in a week, a week after her 22 months birthday.  It's a necessary step, since with Ben coming onboard - we just won't be able to manage effectively otherwise, but I feel sad to let her go and not see her when I come downstairs any time.  When we stopped by the place yesterday, she even played a little bit with the kids, without any problems, danced to the music that was playing, quickly becoming one of the kids, which was great to see, considering nightmarish kindergarten experience I had when I was little.  I hope she'll adjust quickly and like it there... I sincerely hope she does.

      Rita is now able to pick up a ball and put it in the hoop, as well as throw it into a large pale.  And she now says the word 'ball', although the Russian version is still too difficult for her.  Today she started saying 'cow' out of the blue and with upcoming Father's Day yesterday I got the best gift of all - she looked at me and said 'papa'!  It's hard to describe the feeling, but I don't think anything else matches it.

      2 days ago Rita had the first official initiation to potty training.  She was tried on a potty before but without success (a while back).  Now she's not complaining (although she isn't doing much there either).  After sitting on the potty for about 5 minutes, with the reading materials provided by Mom (against Dad's better judgement) - Rita got up, strolled to the living room and... successfully emptied her bladder on the carpet.  Yesterday Rita managed to successfully put the basketball through the hoop, before she would only touch it under the hoop.  Now she's a full fledged basketball star!

      The everpopular 'oh-oh' made its way to Rita's vocabulary yesterday evening.  She used to laugh when I'd say it a short while back... Now she can actually say it herself.

      Rita said 3 new words today: apple, yo-yo and cookie, although cookie sounded more like 'cookah', but we'll count it anyway.

      Rita said "dozhd'", which sounded more like 'dosh' and it was very cute.  Letter 'S' was added to the list of known letters.  Parts of the alphabet are being repeated, shouldn't be too long before she knows the whole alphabet.

      Today Rita said 'purple' for the first time during our visit to Dima's new home in North Seattle.  On the way we saw many balloons at various car dealerships; Rita would say 'shar' after every balloon she'd see.

      'shar'... for some reason banana is 'jish', star is 'tash', street light is 'tekasha' and that one is called practically every time we get to a stop light.  If the light is red and we need to stop - we get an immediate 'aahh', meaning let's go.  If we do not go immediately the sound volume and intensity is increased exponentially.

      Rita was watching Oobi on TV and during the Remember Game correctly identified the fruit that was hidden from view, without anyone asking her.  I almost fell off a chair.

      Rita woke up and the first word out of her mouth was 'Kaki'.  Marina didn't believe it, I did but wanted it verified, since it was the first time in Rita's life that that word was spoken in the morning, first thing.  In any case - verification turned the proper smell (very blatantly so) and that was incredible for both of us.    Then we drove to the daycare and for the  first time Rita did NOT cry !!!  This made our day, week and month!

      It's been 2 days since we've attempted daycare.  Both days went horribly unsuccessful - Rita cried practically the entire time, except for the times she decided to take a nap to recharge for more crying.  The experience has been hard on both myself and Marina and we're possibly contemplating stopping the whole experiment if she doesn't get used to the environment in the next week.  Maybe she's just too little at this stage.  The very first day daycare was open, but very few kids showed up.  We decided not to stay and when leaving the daycare, Rita decided to step off the sidewalk on her own.  That was mistake number one.  I thought to follow Marina's advice and "let her do it" - that was mistake number two.  The third mistake came when Rita went down on her face, right into the hard asphalt... in front of our eyes.  Ouch!!!  Once we calmed her down and cleaned her up - we saw that she scraped a good part of her face, under her nose and on her nose :  I just hope this daycare experiment doesn't end badly...

      Rita now says lots of words, but one of the cutest is ' Oh No! ', which she says incredibly cute with heavy emphasis on 'no'.  And I started teaching her to say ' please ', which she now says with extreme cuteness, it sounds like " pleas' " with the trailing 's' sounding really soft.  Rita's repeating a lot of words now, including most things she hears in her videos.
