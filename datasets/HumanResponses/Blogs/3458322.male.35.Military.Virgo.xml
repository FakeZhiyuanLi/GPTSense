      I started a new hobby a couple of month's ago. I played for the first time about 2 years ago. Has a great time with friends, laughing drinking beer and just having a great time seeing who was making a bigger ass then the other trying to hit that little white ball. The same group of guys decided to give it another try sense we had such a good time before. This time there was a little bit more seriousness in the air. I noticed we were not laughing as much as the first time. I thought to myself, this guys are taking this seriously. Pointers to hitting the ball were flying around like we were professionals. Truth of the matter was, out of almost eight strokes it was all made worth it for that one perfect shot. I'm still trying to learn the game, but I figure a good start would be to look the part of a golfer. Bought a starter bag, shoes and even a golf brand wind breaker. Where I'm currently station I live about a good ten minutes from the military golf course. What luck! It's a beautiful eighteen whole course with a great view of the Heidelberg mountain. My next step is golf lesson's, for thirty five dollars for forty five minutes I'm sure to make the best of it. My wife likes my new hobby, gets me out of the house plus it sounds to me that she is starting to get interested in the sport. I can see it now, an old couple chasing a little white ball around spending quality time together. Life is good.

      I went to register my son for an on post youth facility soccer team. I registered him and found out there was a waiting list. My son was probably 18 on the list that was growing by the minute. I asked what I could do to make sure my son could play, and the receptionist said "volunteer". I've never coached before, and surely no nothing about soccer but that the your ball going into the opposite goal. I went ahead and signed the application and went to my orientation where all was explained to me. Signed for ball, uniforms and a game schedule. Wow! What did I get myself into? I searched the internet for tools and even went to my rivals practices for tips and hints on what to do on at my first practice.   I was very nervous on the first day of practice, with 15 hyped up kids ready to get going. I tried my best not to show it, and even asked my wife if It looked like I new what I was doing? I'm glad the answer was a positive one. Getting off of work, rushing home and changing knowing there 15 kids relying on me to do my part. There were some days when I'd rather of been golfing, but my commitment was priority. It's all about the kids.  Over all the experience was great! I watched the kids grow in the there soccer skills and grow as teammates and learning to work together. The "Golden Knights" (team named by kids) had an almost perfect season of 6-1. More importantly, I was able to work with my stepson and spend some quality time. My first experience in volunteering was great, I'm really looking forward to doing it again.

      I've just recently volunteered to be a part of a Battalion Road march team to walk the one hundred miles in Belgium. The 12 soldier team includes Officers, NCO's and lower enlisted soldiers in the Battalion. The goal of the team is to have all members complete 25 miles per day for four days. The team has been training for the last a couple of months beginning with a four mile road march, and working up to twenty miles weekly. The next step is to complete a twenty five mile road march then two back to back twenty mile road marches. The weight carried in the ruck sack is a mandatory twenty one pounds. Not very much for those who are familiar with the thirty five minimum weight limit for weekly road marches. As you can probably imagine, the twenty one pounds plus water for the walks get very heavy. I've learned to shrug off small blisters, pain and concentrate on one step at a time. I'm currently the oldest member of the team at a ripe old age of thirty five, but probably one of the strongest members. As a leader I show no pain, I am a leader! I take care of the soldiers on the team, and we will finish together. Nijmegan, Belgium, here we come!

      I just don't understand why terrorists feel that the beheading that they have been doing lately are going to prove anything? Do terrorists feel that the American people will fold with disgust and stand by let them do this? Do they(terrorist) think the American Soldier, Marine, Airman, Seaman is going to walk away while one of his brother's has just been beheaded? The feelings are very strong, and the subject a very tender spot in my heart. Could that person that has just been beheaded be me next? Will I let myself fight till the very end, or just freeze in place to be captured and then beheaded? Hell no! I am an American Soldier! I will fight with my brother in arms till the enemy has been brought to his knees. I will not forget my brother's and sister's who have lost there lives in battle. I will fight smart, take care of brothers in arms, and come back home to my family. Serving my country with honor and pride, I will "stand tall".

      I'm writing about different cases involving law enforcement and civilians caught on tape breaking the law, but the law enforcement officers getting away with it. I will try to persuade the reader that law enforcement is being held to a different standard, almost above the law in most cases.

      Subject:  Caught on tape  Thesis statement:  Although video camera's are being used throughout the country catching law enforcement in the act of breaking the law, the acts go unpunished.   I had a change of mind after watching the news earlier in the week. My first three ideas were:  1) Golfing 2) Physical Fitness 3) Nijmegen Road March (20 mile road march)  I decided on the "Caught on tape", because I thought it would be more fun. Please tell me what you think.

           One man, one language, one back ground? Some people would argue that English should be the only language spoken in the United States. For those that know only one language, I'm sure there answer to this question would be "Yes". Unfortunately, the United States of America is made up of so many different people. People from all parts of the globe migrating to the United States for better jobs and wages. With the migration comes there language.        While in the military and visiting different countries, I can relate to being upset at someone else speaking a language that I do not understand. I'd ask myself, "I wonder if there talking bad about me?". So when I'm speaking Spanish, and there is a person there that doesn't understand Spanish you have to show some consideration. If I find myself in a conversation with someone speaking Spanish, while a non-speaking friend is with me, I'll explain the conversation. Then everyone gets something out of it, and walks away happy.       Should English be the only language? I say no! In the military all business is conducted in English, there is a regulation that states so. Do I have a problem with that? Absolutely not. Business does need to be conducted in a language that is understood by the majority. So I'll play devil's advocate. Recent statistics state that Hispanics are a growing race in America. Will Spanish one day be the majority language in America? Hard for me to say, but the possibilities are endless.

           It's 12:15 a.m. and plain is bouncing around like a boat in water. The jumpmaster gives the command and all the paratroopers come to there feet. Green light comes on, and one by one the paratroopers in front of you disappear into the night. What a rush to be part of the 82d Airborne Division.       I wish it was that easy to walk out of a perfectly good airplane with a parachute on your back and fifty-five pounds of gear attached to your harness. But it's not, it all begins about eight hours before you take that step into the black hole. There is a first formation called "manifest", where all soldiers are checked to make sure they are present and all gear is serviceable. Next comes the "PLF's" (performance landing falls) where you get on a three foot platform and perform your landing falls. Each direction one time. Then comes the airplane mock up. You load the mock up like you would the real aircraft, the drills to exit the aircraft are performed, and you walk out like if it was the real thing. All under the close supervision of a jumpmaster. Then you load the transportation to the airfield where you pick up your parachute and reserve, and wait for the go ahead to put on your equipment. You always have a buddy when rigging yourself. Not one person can perform it themselves. Your buddy riggs you up then a jumpmaster comes around and gives you the real inspection. The inspection is done by the book with out falter. Once the equipment checks out, then comes the final slap in the ass, with the jumpmaster saying something like, "Have a good jump!". The you wait for the aircraft to arrive so all can board in the order that was set during initial manifest. You take a seat, fly around for about an hour. The jumpmaster tells you to "get ready", "stand-up", "hook-up", "check static line", "check equipment", you pass up slap in the butt to the person in front of you so it can get to the rear of the aircraft. Once all is ok, then you wait for the green light. Once the green light comes on, you see one paratrooper at a time walking out the door into the black abyss. If someone out there tells you that there not scared when there jumping. They are not telling you the truth. It all takes a toll on you, some people just handle it differently. What a rush! Airborne paratrooper, Hooah!!

      My family and I have returned from a weekend trip to a military resort in Germany. Being the adventurous type's we were not happy walking around in the area where all of the tourist were.   When taking trips in Germany we usually rent a car with a navigation system. First, so we won't get lost getting to our destination. Secondly, and more importantly to use it when visiting sites in the surrounding area.    We woke up one morning, packet the car with a cooler, camera and a full tank of gas. We did what we've done so many times before. Found a location on the map with an asterisk on it. Input the information into the navigation system, and we were on our way. Driving through the southern Alps we noticed a beautifully river to our right. We talked about making a stop and taking a look at the river when a rest stop appeared. We pulled over, grabbed the camera and walked a little way through the woodline to the river.   When me and my wife first met we talked about where we were from. I told her that I was Mexican, born and raised in Texas, she told me she was "Irish", born and raised in South Carolina. I asked about her back ground and she said, "last time I was asked what I was, I said that I was Baptist". That did go over to well so sense then she has said that she is "Irish".  Once at the river we realized how beautifully it really was. We snapped a couple of pictures when a fly fisherman walked towards us. I wondered if the fisherman would take a picture of us. He walked up to us I asked him. He smiled, put the camera in his hand and took the picture. We started talking to him, he asked where we were from, then my wife asked where he was from. He said, "I'm Irish, from Scottland", it seemed like a light bulb had went off in my wife's head like if she was getting reunited with family or something. She said, "I'm Irish". I looked surprised because my wife really had it in her mind that she was "Irish". I cut in really quick hoping he hadn't heard my wife. Fortunately for both of us he had not. We continued our conversation and then said our goodbye's.  In the car we laughed together because she really thought in her mind that she was "Irish". What a fun trip, maybe one day we'll take a trip to Ireland.

      Breaking news comes over the German TV station. The news woman is staring and reading off her cue cards. I change over a couple of stations to an American station and there is the same breaking news. News man looking directly at the camera with his perfect dress and right on the mark appearance. Two different lines scrolling at the bottom of the screen, one has the up to date stock market company percentages and the other having the up to date news. Time and temperature is located at the top right corner and the news set looking like a TV game show.  I asked a German friend of mine why the news woman was reading right of the cue cards what seemed to me like a very boring news cast. His answer was, "the news is to get correct information, not to watch a fireworks show". It took me a little while to understand what he meant, then it started to come together. Watching the news and getting the most information at once in a little bit of time is what I am used to. German's do not need all the fan fair, all they want is the correct information on time. Obviously what the American station is doing is what the viewers want. To much information is the best information, putting as much information on one screen in a little bit of time.

      The last couple of days I've been involved in a class about 25 minutes away from where I'm stationed. One day during my lunch break I went to the local shopette. There I warmed up a cup of noodles and pulled out a sandwich I had in my bag. I had just warmed up my cup of noodles when a man walked in and looked really funny at the coffee machine. He signaled at me like, what the heck is this? I walked over to him and he asked, "where do I pay for this?". I motioned to the register, and continued in telling him to fill his own cup and pay for it there. I grabbed my cup of noodles out of the microwave and went to sit down.   Watching TV I looked over and saw the old man getting his coffee and walking to the register. Trying his best to walk with his cain, coffee and hotdog, the old timer came and sat a couple of seats down from me. I was watching CNN on TV when he asked, "do you think his gone win?". I had a hard time understanding him, with his rough, scratchy voice. Realizing he was talking about the subject on TV, I said "no". That was the beginning of our one and a half hour conversation. We started talking about the upcoming election and then moved on to some other things. We went from politics to marriage to his military career. I really enjoyed the stories the older timer was telling me. The stories this old timer had were fantastic and very interesting. His stern, rough features turned into a smiling very personable face. I really enjoyed the stories the old timer was telling me. Most importantly I enjoyed the smile it brought to his face just talking to someone.   I learned new things like "scratch", he was referring to money. I also learned he's lived in Europe for the past sixty-years. Visiting the United States only five times in that period of time. He talked about his trip to San Antonio, where there was a river that ran right thru the mall, how he was a passenger in his daughter's car and there where car's coming at him from all directions. The way highways would go right thru the city's, stacked up sometimes and going all sorts of directions. The experience was all new to him. We laughed together really hard, because I could see in my mind exactly what he had gone threw.   In the end, I had to get back to class. We said our good byes shaked hands and exchanged names. I really enjoyed my time with Mr. Mulls, and I could tell from his actions he had a good conversation as well.   Taking the time for a little conversation, what a great experience.

      I wrote on my current training for the 100 mile road march in Nijmegan, Netherlands. I didn't realize how much this road march was effecting my life. Writing my first blog on the subject I realized how much it had consumed me. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where either I will continue to push myself, or just let age effect me like other senior soldiers in my unit. I know now that I will never stop pushing myself physically and mentally. First of all continuing my education and trying to get my associates is a big step for me. Second, training for the road march is challenging me physically. I sometimes feel like I'm not doing enough in life trying to improve myself. But I am, and I've come to realize that things are not that bad and I have come along way. I'm doing things right now that others in my age and profession are not even thinking about. Thanks to my wife I continue challenging myself, and that is what I have to prove. Regardless of any obstacles, keep challenging yourself!

      I was in sixth grade and on my way to P.E.. I walked in the locker room, changed, and walked out on the Gym floor just like every other day. This day was different, our gym teacher was out for the day so a substitute teacher was present. Once we found out that we had a substitute, the class went into a frenzy. Like a swarm of bees with nothing to do.   This week we were learning how to play tennis, so the teacher lead us out to the tennis courts. Teams were picked and courts assigned to the teams. We all began to play tennis, doing our best in a sport we new little about. I was beginning to get board, and started wondering around looking for some fun. I was about two courts down from the teacher with a tennis ball in my hand. It was a straight shot! I don't know what came over me, but next thing I new the ball was headed straight to the teacher chest. I saw the ball hit him in the chest, it seemed to me like he had been shot. He didn't know what hit him. He shouted out, "who threw this ball?". No one new what the heck he was talking about. The class was gathered, the principle called, and still the student was not found.   The next day the whole school found out what happened. There were rumors floating around about who did it. I heard a couple of kids say they probably new who did it. That day I just didn't want to attend gym class. The regular gym teacher was in, and I new there was going to be some hell to pay. I changed and walked into the gym, the substitute teacher was standing there next to the gym teacher. This time the bees were not active, all of us were quite.   I Looked at the substitute teacher and I felt really bad. He was an older man, just probably trying to get some extra money. The guilt was killing me. Would I get caught? Did someone see me do it? Will I get suspended? What will my parents say? No one would ever guess, that I would of done this. The gym teacher had each student walk into his office and give a name if we new who did it. I was scared, really scared. Everyone had been threw his office, the time had come. He lectured us a little bit and then had us run a couple of laps.   I will never forget that day, the day I will regret for the rest of my life. The time I kept quite, so I wouldn't get in trouble for something I did, and new was wrong.   The substitute was an older man then, this was about twenty-two years ago. Poor old man (God rest his soul) is probably not with us any more. I will live with this the rest of my life, the day I hit an old man with a tennis ball. If your still out there MR. Substitute teacher in the six grade, I'm deeply sorry!

      What did you know already? I new that writing was not one of my stronger points. This class was very difficult due to that fact, and I had to take extra time in completing assignments.   What helped? I think that the class was laid out very well in the "black board" site. If I had any questions on anything, all I had to do was look threw "course information", and "course documents" and my questions were answered. In addition, I learned to take out extra words out of my sentences, and pay more attention to what I was writing.   What was hard? Expectations on my writings. Not knowing if my writings were up to standard for this course.

      Things were going really well with my paper then it came down to finding material to actually research my paper, and I just didn't find anything that I felt was very helpful. The internet was a great site for information, but that was it. I needed more, the library was a very helpful research tool and one I had available. So I changed the subject of my paper to one of my original subjects. Instead of doing the Nijmegen paper, I decided to do it on "Fitness Walking", as a physical fitness exercise. I'm glad I did because the subject for me was much easier to research.
