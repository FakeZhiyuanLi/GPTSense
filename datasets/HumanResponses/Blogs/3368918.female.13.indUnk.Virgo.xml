      Today was supposed to be a sorta good day because i was suppose to go and see some paralyzed golf. But on the way there some idiot in the back seat decided to be funny and throw a piece of candy at the teacher. Now, 2 morrow, the whole entire bus including the innocent one has a detention everyday until the mastermind is caught. So, from now on I won't be getting home from school until 3.30    Wish Me Luck

      I really hate hate school rite now. I HATE the ten million projects that are due like next week... I HATE the eachers bc their starting to get on my nerves bc they think they no me so well(jk i luv my teachers)... and I HATE having to wake up at 6 o'clock ever morning to go to school.                                                           WHY CAN'T SCHOOL BE OVER YET!!!

      After a game that Jackie and I won our Mansfield game (but i can't say the same thing about our mission game...M.M.M. tehehe), we went back to Plymouth street. Throughout the game we had written journal entries ALL over our bodies and it was hehe, even though we wrote on other things other than our bodies. Oh Well, now the concession stand will remember us for the rest of it's concrete life. Tehehe                  Oh yah -   we stole Ryan's hacky sack and have frequent urges for it.      UH,UH

      This song makes me cry!  Iris And I'd give up forever to touch you Cuz I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now  And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life Cuz sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies Yeah, you'd bleed just to know you're alive  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  And I don't want the world to see me Cuz I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am  I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am
