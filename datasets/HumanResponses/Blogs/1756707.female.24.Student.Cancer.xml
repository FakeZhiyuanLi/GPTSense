      Topping: 1 stick butter 1 1/2 C sugar 2 T water 1 t gr. cinnamon 4 cups cranberries (I usually use about a bag and a half, which isn't 4 cups, but it works)  Generously grease a 9-inch springform pan and wrap the outside well with foil to avoid leakage.  Preheat oven to 350F.  Set pan aside on a baking sheet.    Melt butter in a medium saucepan.  Add sugar, water, and cinnamon.  Cook over low heat, stirring till sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes.  Stir in cranberries, pour into pan and spread evenly.  Cake batter: 1 1/2 C cake flour (I use regular all-purpose flour) 1/2 t baking soda 1/2 t salt 3/4 stick butter, at room temperature 1/2 sugar 1/2 c packed light brown sugar 2 eggs 3/4 sour cream 1 t vanilla  Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.  Beat butter and both sugars together till smooth and fluffy.  Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each.  Add half of flour mixture, mix well.  Add sour cream and vanilla, mix well.  Add the rest of the flour mixture, mix well.  Spread batter in pan, covering berries evenly.  Bake 45-50 minutes (it always takes longer than this -- more like 65 or 70 minutes) until top is golden brown and edges come away from the sides.  A toothpick in the center should come out clean.  Set the cake on a rack for 10 minutes to cool.  Run a knife around the edge to loosen the cake.  Invert it onto a plate.  Remove the foil, the ring, and the pan bottom.  Replace any cranberries that have escaped, cut into wedges and serve.  VERY pretty, very holiday-ish, slightly tart, very moist.  Yum.

      I just made some divine egg salad, which I've been craving like nobody's business for the last few days.  So this isn't really a recipe -- but very yummy.  hard boiled eggs, chopped mayo chipotle mustard a couple cornichon pickles, chopped a couple shakes of hot sauce  Very yum.  Very Zen, too.  Esp on marble rye bread.

      2 T olive oil 1 small onion, diced 1 clove garlic, minced 3 sprigs fresh thyme - may substitute dried 1-2 T basil (or dill) 28 oz crushed tomatoes 1 1/2 C chicken broth 3 T honey 1 1/2 t salt 1/4 t ground pepper 1/3 c heavy cream In a medium pot, heat the oil. Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tender - about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and basil and stir until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, broth, honey, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until reduced by a quarter - approx. 15-20 minutes. Puree in blender - BE CAREFUL as soup will be extremely hot and has a tendency to go everywhere if you're not looking. Return to pot and add cream. Heat gently and adjust seasonings. Good with soft French bread or grilled cheese sandwiches.  I love this recipe.  I love homemade soup on a cold and dreary day.  Yum.  Recipe from  urlLink Fine Cooking

      This is the soup I just made for dinner, and it was marvelously delicious -- a little sweet (but there are no sweeteners in it), a little spicy (from the parsnips), very hearty and autumn-y.

      1 lb caramels, unwrapped 1/2 C evaporated milk  Melt caramels in evaporated milk, then set aside. Do not melt on stove if you can help it - microwaving seems to keep the mixture from burning.  2 C flour 2 C oatmeal 1/2 C brown sugar 1 t baking soda 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 C butter or margarine  Preheat the oven to 350F. Mix together flour, oats, sugar, soda, and butter. Divide mixture in half, then press half into a 9 by 13 pan, greased at your discretion. Bake 10 minutes. Sprinkle baked bars with 6 oz package of chocolate chips. Spread on caramel mixture, then add the remaining half of the batter. Bake 25 minutes.  *** Sarah and I embarked on the Christmas cookie madness - we have a long list, but only got a few things done.  More baking tomorrow - and consequently more recipes.  Why the heck do I need another blog?  I used to have a foodie site which I loved but never updated - and consequently no one read it.  I thought maybe the convenience of  urlLink blogger  would make popping favorite recipes online a little easier.  So watch this space for more recipe goodness as the tasty meals are prepared.  :)

      E asked for my stew recipe last night, and like many things, I don't have one.  But here's what I told her (in case some day I'm old and senile and don't remember how I do this):  My stew changes every time I make it, depending on what we have --   But here's what I did Sunday night.   Sauteed a chopped onion in some olive oil, added some sliced carrots and diced potato, let them saute for a bit.  Added a big can of stewed tomatoes (I would normally add diced tomatoes, but didn't have any) and their juice, added some veggie bouillon cubes, and some water.  A can of corn, a can of blackeyed peas.  Let that simmer for a while, added some thyme, oregano, celery seed, and a bay leaf.   Once everything is all stew-y, I added about two tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  Then I mixed up a package of pre-packaged biscuit mix (the one I used was cheddar and garlic), added a little extra cheddar, and spooned it on top of the stew.  Let those cook for a bit, and ate it.   Nothing major, nothing complicated.  If I were adding chicken or something, I'd do it right after the onions.   So there, for posterity's sake.

      I tried to make tortellini carbonara last night - lovely portabella tortellini (pre-fab, of course), bacon, cream sauce, etc.  Unfortunately the recipe called for eggs, and no one seemed really sure if it was safe to eat a sauce containing real eggs - and I neglected to heat it up slowly, so the dish ended up looking like tortellini, bacon, and scrambled eggs.  Singularly unappetizing.  Any suggestions?  The recipe I used was a close approximation of  urlLink this one , though with less cream.  Help!

      1 C sour cream 1 can cream of chicken soup 1/4 C dry white wine 2 C cooked chicken breast 1/4 C minced onion 4 oz sliced water chestnuts 1/2 C sliced black olives 1 C cashews 1 C grated cheddar cheese  Mix sour cream & soup & wine together. Add chicken, onion, water chestnuts, olives, and cashews and stir to combine. Top with cheese and bake at 350F for 35-40 minutes. Serves 4-6. Good with rice or soft French bread.  This recipe, a family favorite, was given to my mom by her friend Nice Phoebe. Nice Phoebe got the recipe from her friend Nice Nancy, who knew the eponymous Mean Nancy. Mean Nancy was not a nice person but made a good casserole.

      2 C flour 1/4 C packed brown sugar 1 T baked powder 1/4 t salt 1/4 C butter, chilled 3/4 C dried cherries 1/4 C chopped walnuts 3/4 C heavy cream 1 egg  Preheat oven to 375F.  Cut butter into dry ingredients.  Add cherries and walnuts and toss to mix.  In a separate bowl, beat together cream and egg, and slowly pour into dry ingredients.  Knead just until it comes together, 3-4 times.  Divide dough in half.  On lightly floured board, shape each half into 6" round.  Cut into wedges (4-6).  Bake on ungreased cookie sheet about 20 minutes.  Serve warm.  I'm thinking these might be good with oatmeal - I'm going to have to experiment.

      3/4 C butter, cut into pieces 12 oz chopped chocolate (semi sweet, or a mixture of semisweet and bittersweet) -- I used chocolate chips 6 eggs, separated, at room temp 1/2 C honey (divided into 1/4 c) 1 T vanilla 1/8 t salt  Butter a 9 or 10 inch springform pan.  Line the bottom with parchment paper, butter the paper and flour the entire pan, and wrap the outside with foil.  Preheat oven to 350F and set a rack in the center.  Melt the butter and chocolate in a double boiler, don't allow water to boil.  Stir occasionally, and remove from heat when melted; let cool to lukewarm (didn't take as long as I thought it would, about five minutes).    Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and 1/4 C honey with an electric mixer for 3 minutes, or until very thick and pale.  Fold in the lukewarm chocolate and then fold in the vanilla and salt.  In another bowl, using clean dry beaters, whip the egg whites till soft peaks form.  Gradually add the rest of the honey, beating until medium-firm peaks form.  Fold the egg whites into the chocolate in three additions.  Pour the batter into the pan and smooth the top.  Bake the cake 50 minutes until the top is puffed (might crack) and a tester inserted in the center comes out with some crumbs attached.  Cool the cake in the pan on a rack.  Be warned: it falls quite a bit.  Run a knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake, remove the sides of the pan.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar.  So yummy!  Almost a souffle -- so be careful while it's in the oven, don't jump up and down in the kitchen, or it will fall early.

      (warning: may be habit forming)  Mash six medium potatoes, then set aside.  Blend together, then add to potatoes: 4 oz sour cream 3 oz cream cheese, cut up 1 T butter 1 t onion or garlic salt (more to taste) 1/4 t pepper (more to taste)  Put potato mixture in greased casserole dish - I prefer a low-sided oval Corningware dish - and top with: 1/4 - 1/2 C milk 1 T butter  Bake uncovered at 350F for 1 hour, stirring twice. Can be made in advance, then heated up - just be mindful of moisture and add more milk or sour cream as necessary. When I make them in advance, I usually halve the baking time - baking for 25-30 minutes, then covering with foil until it's time to prepare the meal - then baking another 30-45 minutes, adding milk or sour cream and topping with more butter as necessary.  I sometimes like to add 1 C cheddar cheese and more garlic - the cheese tends to burn so if you add it, you'll need to stir more often. I hate peeling vegetables - hate it hate it hate it - but it's worth the ten minutes with the peeler to have these potatoes. I know this all sounds like propaganda - but try it! You'll like it! I've been assured that they're just as good with low-fat ingredients.

      2 C all-purpose flour  1/4 C packed brown sugar  1 T baking powder  1/4 t ground nutmeg  1/4 t salt  1/4 C butter, chilled and diced  1 C fresh cranberries, roughly chopped  1/3 C white sugar  grated zest of one orange  1/2 C chopped walnuts (optional) 3/4 C half-and-half cream  1 egg  Heat oven to 375F.  In a large bowl, stir together flour, brown sugar, baking powder, nutmeg and salt. Cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  Toss cranberries with sugar; add to flour mixture along with orange peel and nuts. Mix lightly.  Beat together cream and egg; slowly pour into dry ingredients, mixing with rubber scraper until dough forms. Knead dough 4 or 5 times, being careful not to over handle. Divide dough in half, and shape each half into a 6 inch circle. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Place scones on lightly greased baking sheets.  Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.  These were hella tasty, even without the nuts.  The dough was lighter and wetter than the  urlLink Cherry Walnut Scones  I made the other week, but they were still tasty and not as dry when baked.

      1 lb chicken breast halves Kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper 2 T vegetable oil + more as needed 1/2 medium onion, finely diced 1 T minced fresh ginger 2 T seeded, minced fresh jalapeno (I left this out) 1 T sweet curry powder 1 C low-salt chicken broth 1 medium potato, peeled and cut into 1/4" dice 5 1/2 oz can coconut milk, well shaken 1/2 C frozen peas 2 T roughly chopped fresh cilantro  Trim the chicken into 3/4" thick pieces and season generously with salt and pepper.  In a 10" straight sided saute pan (or skillet), heat the oil over medium-high heat until it's hot enough to shimmer.  Add half the chicken and cook, flipping once, until lightly browned and just barely cooked through.  Transfer the chicken to a plate, and repeat with the remaining chicken.  Cover with foil to keep warm.  Return the pan to medium heat and, if it looks dry, add another T oil.  Add the onion, ginger, and jalapeno and saute, stirring almost constantly with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables soften, about 2 minutes.  Add the curry powder and saute for 30 seconds.  Pour in the chicken broth and scrape the pan with the spoon to loosen any browned bits.  Add the potato and 1/2 t salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, partially covered (I do this with an inverted skillet), until the potato is barely tender, 7-8 minutes.  Add the coconut milk and peas; simmer uncovered until the peas are thawed, the potato is fully tender, and the sauce is somewhat thickened, 4-5 minutes.  Taste the sauce; add salt and pepper as needed.  Add the chicken along with any accumulated juices to the sauce and turn to coat.  Serve immediately, garnished with the cilantro.  When I made this for Meat Night it was really tasty, though a little salty.  I would recommend getting a low-salt broth, and maybe cutting the salt added to the recipe.  A different curry might also help.  Either way, this was really good with Parmesan couscous, a green salad, and some fresh melon.  Recipe from  urlLink Fine Cooking

       for Hannah   1 ripe mango 1 ripe avocado 1 can whole-kernel corn, drained 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained handful fresh cilantro vinaigrette dressing  Chop the mango and avocado and toss with the corn and beans.  Mince the cilantro and add.  Toss all of this with a good vinaigrette dressing - I used a lime basil vinaigrette - and let sit for half an hour approx to allow the flavors to mellow.  I used about a half cup of dressing - use more or less to your liking.  This salad was spontaneous and amazing, and would probably be good with some fresh diced tomato as well.

Coat a 9-inch round cake pan with cooking spray; line bottom with wax paper. Coat wax paper with cooking spray.   Beat 2/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup margarine at medium speed of a mixer until blended (about 5 minutes). Add vanilla and egg; beat well. Lightly spoon 1-1/3 cups flour into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine 1-1/3 cups flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add flour mixture to creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Stir in blueberries.   Pour into prepared pan. Combine 3 tablespoons sugar and remaining ingredients in a bowl; stir until mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle sugar mixture over batter. Bake at 350°F for 40 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.  This cake was nearly effortless and tastes soooo good.

       with many thanks to Dan Wong and Shawn Gilmore   1/2 C olive oil 1/2 C balsamic (or red wine) vinegar 2-3 T basil 2-3 T oregano 3+ cloves garlic, minced 3-4 good sized portabella caps  Clean mushroom caps and place in a large Ziploc bag.  Toss marinade together in small bowl, then pour over mushrooms in the Ziploc bag.  Seal the bag, then tumble the marinade around the mushrooms.  The longer you can let it marinate, the better - 4-6 hours is ideal.  Grill mushrooms 3-5 minutes, basting with marinade from the bag.  Set aside.  2-3 chicken breasts  Trim any fat from the chicken and slice into cutlets.  Grill until cooked through, basting with remaining marinade.  To assemble sandwich, place one chicken cutlet and one mushroom cap on a hamburger bun (toasted, if possible) with a slice of cheese between the cap and the chicken.  Tasty!

      1 box Butter Recipe Fudge cake mix (plus ingredients called for by cake mix -- eggs and whatnot) 1lb bag of caramels 1/2 c condensed milk chopped pecans Turtles (the chocolate candy, not the amphibian)  Make cake, bake slightly less than recommended.  (Like one minute short of done.)    Unwrap all the caramels (fun while watching West Wing; keep wrappers away from curious cats), and add to condensed milk in a big bowl.  Microwave till all melted and gooey together, stirring often to make sure they don't burn.  Poke some holes in the cake with a chopstick, and pour all the caramel all over the cake while it's still somewhat warm.  Throw some chopped pecans on there, and nicely place some Turtles somewhere where they'll look pretty.

Scoop out the flesh, and chop roughly.  I usually do this with a wooden spoon after all the avocado is in the mixing bowl.  Add chopped tomato and onion.  Add cilantro, lime juice, vinaigrette dressing, and spices to taste.  Mix 'em all up.   Great  with Hint of Lime chips.

      I got home from campus last night with a zillion ideas in my head, a million different directions at once, and too many things to think about.  I kept having good ideas, and wanted to stay up all night and think some of them through, write them through as a way of thinking about them -- but I have to sleep at some point.  But I was feeling so brilliant and coherent, it seemed a shame to waste that on sleep.  So I talked to Greg online for a while, and was ranting about my brilliance, and here's a (partial!) list of the stuff I was thinking about yesterday:  *jobs  *options after grad school  *ideas for teaching next semester - moving the literacy journal assignment to the beginning of the semester, talking more about "the bare minimum" on assignments the way Jody does, new ways of organizing the semester, focusing on literacy, the university rather than literacy and language  *revising my syllabus  *ideas for a project/publishable paper on dance composition (choreography) and process and writing       studies *work on the project i'm doing for peter's class on the syllabus for the class that trains new instructors  *work on the textbook archiving project i'm doing for the same class  *work on the paper i'm writing for debbie on literacy in ancient greece and its relationship to ancient literacy and literate practices *new ways to think about the relationship between lit and comp in my department *conversations i had today (with Peter, Paul, Oday, Jody, Nicole and Derek)  So I have much to think about -- and the week isn't over yet.  I love my life being this way -- it's good, productive, intense, packed, moving -- and very difficult.  I can't imagine any other life -- or perhaps I can't imagine not wanting a life where I'm so intensely involved and engaged.  I am certainly capable of imagining a life outside academia.  So yes, much to think about.

      I had to put this as a post cause it was too long and they wouldn't let me post it as comments:  Yeah, I'm totally not offended by any of this. There are many things I like about the lab: the space it affords me (it's big, with big windows, and I can work on a board or with a screen or at tables, etc.) I can also teach web design, and if I want my students to do this, they have to learn, and can't do that at home. But I certainly don't think computers make my class more democratic or solve any problems. They bring up new ones. I decided to teach in the lab cause it was available, and I really like it. But I'm certain it constrains me in ways that are invisible, that I might see more in another space. They certainly can be distracting, but I have the conference table space, although it is small. Well, on and on from here. I don't think either way is right or wrong. I don't think you and Jody have to do it a particular way to be right. I think it depends on what works for you. I like it that Jody thinks you can teach this stuff in many different ways. I think I can teach work and choices in the lab, and I want to try it next year. But it might constrain my students to only work in computer mediums. I guess we'll see... Wow, this was too long. Sorry.

      Reading Charles Moran's "Technology and the Teaching of Writing," (from  A Guide to Composition Pedagogies , eds. Tate, Rupiper, and Schick, 2001), and have lots of thoughts going on.  Between our recent visits to the Allerton conference and conversations with our students about technology, Jody and I have been thinking about this issue a lot lately.    So here are the things I find useful about Moran's piece:   He begins with a historical overview of technology in writing classrooms, and in a few brief sentences he links historical movements of technology with theoretical movements in composition: "In the early 1980s, the 'age of the microcomputer,' technology seemed to support invention, writing, and revising, activities that defined process-based pedagogies.  At the same time, however, this same technology supported microcomputer-based skill-and-drill exercises, which grew from the print-based workbooks that were a staple of the current-traditional curriculum.  In the early 1990s, when local area networks and the Internet began to become more readily available, these new manifestations of computer-based technology supported a social, constructivist pedagogy.  Today, as the Web captures our imaginations, we find that composing in hypermedia and adding graphics and sound to our writing seem increasingly appropriate activities in our writing courses, and as our students gain access to the Web, the research paper returns to the center of our consciousness, though perhaps in new forms" (Moran 203).    This historical-technological-theoretical link raises a kind of chicken-and-egg question -- did the theoretical movements of the times (process, social constructivism, multimedia and multimodal) drive the uses of technology?  Did technological innovations not specifically designed for the classroom (but certainly being taken up in that way) drive the theoretical and pedagogical movements?  Of course, I don't think the two can be separated, but the thought is fascinating.  He lays out the kinds of responses people/scholars have made to technology and writing instruction: prophets of doom (technology is the end of civilization as we know it), evangelist expressivists (technology is inherently democratic and will release creativity and empower individuals), and then (his own) more pragmatic view: "Computers have altered our landscape.  They have changed the medium in which some fraction of our students read and write.  Therefore we, as writing teachers, need to pay attention to what is happening.  On the basis of this knowledge, we will be able to make informed decisions about our use of technology in our teaching" (Moran 204).  Aha!   This  is what has been bugging me about ISU's approach to technology (using them only as a representative example -- they're not the only ones I've heard say this).  Computers don't magically make things better -- nothing does.  And they don't universally ruin things, either (although ISU would NEVER make that argument).  But they are a reality that we need to acknowledge and deal with, and there are as many productive ways to do that as there are teachers in the field.  Not everyone needs to always teach with a computer for each student in the classroom -- there are multiple other ways of productively dealing with technology, ways of thinking about it and having students think about it.  On the use of computers in the classroom: "The PC-filled room, though it may be with us in some places for some time, is a stage in our evolution as writing teachers.  When and if most of our students have access to computers in dormitory rooms or home settings, the computer-equipped classroom will seem much less necessary than it now does to writing programs" (Moran 206).  ISU would disagree, I think, given what's-her-face's shock at being asked if she  really *needs* computers to teach writing.  Even if students all own their own  computers, she would fight for computers in the classroom, because in order to  write during class time, you need computers.  But what Moran is arguing, that if  students have access, we don't need in-class compters, suggests that not  everyone sees the comp classroom as a place to write.  If computers aren't  necessary in the classroom once students have their own, then not everyone is  writing in the classroom.   I wonder if this argument upsets Hannah, if this feels like an attack on her teaching practices and use of computer classrooms (should be computer classroom - singular - since we only have one, but that's another matter).  It isn't meant to be that kind of an attack -- I think she'd agree that if her students all had universal access to good computers with the kind of software she needs them to have (PageMaker, etc), then she could spend class time doing other things besides working in class on the computers.    Interestingly, as a side note, the prejudice for PCs and not Macs in this piece is pretty impressively embedded and invisible.  And universal, I think.  Interesting.  Macs don't even exist as a viable option, as a meaningful choice, because apparently no one ever uses them.  Interesting.  He also has some interesting ideas about email and how it changes the nature of communication between teachers and students (levels of formality, etc), and also labor conditions.  He says, "The great boon, and the great evil, of computer-mediated communication is that it makes it possible for us to be available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, in effect putting in unpaid hours for our employers.  Offline, we have evolved strategies for limiting our availability: we post office hours when students can meet with us, and we have some way of screening our incoming telephone calls -- either a secretary/receptionist or a voice-mail system.  Online, until and unless we develop conventions that will protect us -- such as telling our students that we don't read our email on weekends -- we can be reached at all hours, Monday through Sunday" (Moran 211).    This is really interesting to me -- I never question how available I am to my students, and I don't see it as a bad thing.  Problematic, perhaps, but not bad.  They have my email, home phone, screen name...my students have about twelve different ways of getting ahold of me, and I don't want them to feel they can't contact me on the weekends.  We expect our students to work on the weekend, how can we not return the same commitment?  No one has EVER said that academia was a 9-5 job.  But the other reason this is interesting is that Jody and I are considering setting up IM office hours next semester to be even more available to students on a regular basis.  I wonder how Moran would respond to that.    I could go on, but those are the main things from Moran that could be useful in terms of thinking through ways to respond to people who ask Jody and I when we're going to take our course online and have our students work in hypermedia/new media/whatever the term of the moment is.  But the point is that web sites are ONE mode, ONE genre (yes, I could make the argument that web sites involve many genres, but you get my point).  Our point is to allow students the choice of MANY genres in order to achieve the goals they've set for a particular piece.  Yeah.  I'm done now.

      I could read maps before I could read books. (37)  A map does not converse in sentences.  Its language is a half-heard murmur, fractured, fitful, nondiscursive, nonlinear.  'It is almost as if one had to read from a page where all the words had been assembled in random order: obviously there could be no fixed starting point or sequence of perception.' (37-38, qtd from Arthur H. Robinson and Barbara Bartz Petchenik in  The Nature of Maps )  A map has no vocabulary, no lexicon of precise meanings.  It communicates in lines, hues, tones, coded symbols, and empty spaces, much like music.  Nor does a map have its own voice.  It is many-tongued, a chorus reciting centuries of accumulated knowledge in echoed chants.  A map provides no answers.  It only suggests where to look:  discover this, reexamine that, put one thing in relation to another, orient yourself, begin here... Sometimes a map speaks in terms of physical geography, but just as often it muses on the jagged terrain of the heart, the distant vistas of memory, or the fantastic landscapes of dreams. (38)  A single map, observed Denis Wood in  The Power of Maps , is not a self-contained document but a compilation of what ' others have seen  or found out or discovered, others often living but more often dead, the things they learned piled up in layer on top of layer so that to study even the simplest-looking image is to peer back through ages of cultural acquisition.' (95)  In geometry,  describe  means to draw or trace the outline of something; in poetry, it means to get at the essence of something, to bring it to life in a way that's both startling and beautiful.  You've got to do both kinds of description -- and do it in a medium that's partially visual, partially mathematical, partially textual, a complicated miscellany of scale, orientation, projection, grids, signs, symbols, lines, colors, words. (97)  Mapmaking has been going on since at least the Stone Age: a picture map painted on a wall of the famous Catal Huyuk settlement in south-central Turkey dates back to about 6200 B.C., nearly three thousand years before the first system of written language appeared.  And recent studies have shown that even very young children have an uncanny ability to understand maps, fueling speculation that we are born with the skill. (142) (note: All cultures are thought to make maps.  See David Stea, James M. Blaut, and Jennifer Stephens, "Mapping as a Cultural Universal," in  The Construction of Cognitive Maps , ed. Juval Portugali (Boston: Kluwer, 1996), pp1-16.)

       Some of the responses to Joyce's query about undergrad research *in composition studies* exemplify a serious oversight common in our field, one also exemplified some months ago on this list when another guiding light in comp studies couldn't seem to fathom the notion that undergraduates might do research ABOUT WRITING.  We are too given to sharing this failure of imagination with our colleagues across the university.   I read Joyce's question as asking not whether undergraduates are  researching in our courses (of course they are) but researching in our *field* (pretty much they aren't, if our literature is any indication). I'm eager to see positive responses to this query, but I'll be shocked if there are many.  This lack of push for students to do research on writing correlates with a lack of majors in comp studies.  (We are, I think, seeing an increase in "writing" majors, which is wonderful, but lots of these still tend to have a how-to focus rather than a research-about focus.)  It's simply not seen as a subject of serious undergraduate study in the university.  This makes sense when you recognize that most of our fellow faculty imagine writing as a basic skill that enables other learning.  We wouldn't research multiplication tables; why research writing?   This is exactly the kind of attitude that makes me life so incredibly difficult.  And besides, we do research multiplication tables, along with every other system of organized cognition that anyone has thought to research yet, and dozens more that no one's thought of yet.  Interestingly, the notion of researching writing strikes many (based on my experience/research) as counterintuitive.   Counterintuitive? Wow.   Not only undergrads, but fellow professors have a difficult time imagining what "writing about writing" might look like.  Surprising to me, but the attitude seems to be out there.    And one final question--if we start expecting independent research of undergraduates, what will be expected of graduate students?  Of faculty?    Oh my God.  For fuck's sake. Certainly, by all means, let's not start expecting grad students to do research.  And definitely, let's not have faculty do research.  Wait, what's that you say?  Grad students and faculty  already  do independent research?  Oh.  Well, then by all means, let's not hold undergrads to the same standard.    It may seem like I took this quote out of context just so I could berate it, that its author couldn't possibly have meant what I think he meant.  Not true.  He meant it.  There was no context for this.    David Schwalm is certainly on target that a necessary condition for undergraduate writing majors to engage in authentic research is to be able to work with faculty mentors, who themselves are engaged in meaningful research.   Is there a paucity of "research" among composition/rhetoric faculty?  Really? Not in my department.  I suspect so. Again, David is spot on to note that institutional research can provide a wealth of opportunities--for faculty and students (both grad and undergrad).  But how much of this kind of assessment is really going on? Expertise in design, not to mention funding, may be problems--but none of those can be addressed until leadership for such activities is present.  Because so many of us were trained in the humanistic tradition, there may be a serious problem with comp/rhet leaders who are unfamiliar with social science-type research methods.  Really? Not in my department.   What might an undergraduate research project look like? [To answer Kaye Adkins' question.] For instance, a tutor working in a writing center notices that non-traditional students have some of the same problems as traditional-age students but also a different set.  As a non-traditional student herself, the tutor finds this interesting and sets about investigating by doing a review of literature, interviews of students (with IRB approval of  course--another area we tend not to be familiar with...), Really? Not in my department.  analysis of their work, interviews with faculty--and then produces three documents: 1) a research report; 2) a "tips for working with non-traditional students for other tutors; and 3) a "Tutor's Column" for WLN.  The student could apply for undergrad research funds and then disemminate through an on-campus Research Day or at a professional conference.   (Okay, another question: do undergrads present at CCCC? Fuck no. Grad students are barely welcome there as attendees, never mind undergrads prsenting.  Andrea Lunsford and colleagues certainly had a stimulating session this past year in which not only undergrads participated but also high school students.)  Yeah, good for Andrea Lunsford.  She's still a twit.   A second example: the director of WAC/WID wants to see if syllabi taht are designated with writing intensive really are writing intensive.  A team of undergrads working with the faculty mentors collect syllabi, create a grid for analyzing syllabi, and then review the syllabi.  Such an analysis might lead to a statement such as 55% of the syllabi that were reviewed by an oversight  committee demonstrate that writing is being taught as envisioned and approved while X% do not contain evidence that writing is being taught.  This would have implications for revising syllabi and thus feed back into improving learning on campus...and so on.  Other research projects might focus more on specific disciplines, say two students who want to get a sense of how writing  is taught in pre-health disciplines and how that affects the application process for medical school.   Quite clearly, faculty roles and rewards must include specific information that the work of mentoring undergraduates is important.  Otherwise, this is a lost cause.

      Just found a blog, or part of a blog, on   blog authorship , and am fascinated by what's going on there -- but there are no contextual clues as to who this is, where this blog is coming from, what disciplinarity (if any) they/he/she is working from, how many people are involved, what the point/context is...interesting.  V. interesting.    Not sure what to make of the blog, but this quote is fascinating to me (other people are considering these ideas!) --   "I'm working on a post about blog-authorship that should go up in the next day or so, but here's a question: Who is the author of this blog? Joe Duemer would be the most obvious answer, but I increasingly have to recognize that the authorship of this blog is collective. Most obviously, Burningbird & Stgavrosthewonderchicken, who have designed the space to my specs, are authors here. But why not include Been & Mean Trott? They wrote the code that makes this space possible. And certainly all the people I link to share in the authorship of my writing to some degree--and whether they approve or not."   We haven't thought yet about linking to people as part of authorship.  We've thought about it (at least in talking about it, I don't know if we've posted anything about this yet) in terms of public/private issues, but not in terms of authorship.  I am writing a post now (here's the meta!) using someone else's words (not that I even know whose they are) to further my own ideas.  Who's the author of this post?

      So, watching this whole thing that has happened on Joe's blog has me thinking about ownership issues. It's almost beyond an intersection of public & private here. It's Joe's blog, and  the argument has absolutely nothing to do with anthing he said. Is the space his anymore? But it's public space. Anyone can post there. So he doesn't own it. Neither do any of the others own each others' blogs, yet they want to control the space, what gets said about whatever else. Is something that someone says about you yours or that person's? Who owns words?  And what about authorship here. You don't write your own blog. But it's yours, so we think, "it's my blog and I write it." Well, not really. We all write each other's blogs together. We shape them together. I write about books, movies, etc. because that's what my friends write about. I don't write about too many really personal things because I don't want people to read them. But some things that I don't consider all that personal could be used to represent me in ways I don't want to be represented, so I can't actually control this. There's a lot of inter-authorship (is that a word? I just don't think co-authorship works here) going on in a blog.

      More thoughts... I really am curious to hear your responses to my questions, as I figured you did this in your classes, but I wasn't sure exactly how. I am beginning to see ways I could bring other kinds of writing in BTW. I am especially seeing ways we could do more of a new media focus. My students might hate this. But I think I could even do another course I proposed on this topic, although my students might hate that too because it'd be "too theoretical". I don't know. I have many good ideas, but much bad audience analysis.  Yesterday, since the paper prototype thing, I am thinking about prototypes. They use these things to do almost everything, like a wooden box to decide what size a PDA should be, or car prototypes, etc. We are going to use paper, scissors, sticky notes, tape, pens, & pencils to create a mock website that users could test to see if the arrangement of information makes sense to them. What could we do with this other than what people usually do? Where are the distinctions between work & play here?  One of my students, Lauren, said last night, that she is in technical writing basically because she doesn't have to think for herself. She is very sweet, and she didn't say this in a mean way, but I was shocked. I guess I should have known it. She explained that she hates having papers where she has to come up with something to say about anything, a book, etc. I don't think it's that she has nothing to say, but that it's difficult to write about what you have to say. (I relate to this because I have such a hard time writing about things I care about). She says she hates writing. But not really, she just hates expressivist writing. I told her, it's not that you don't get to think for yourself in technical writing, it's that you don't get to write about whatever you want. But the thinking part is not attached. You have to think for yourself in order to be a good technical writer.  Bringing this back to blogs, why do people like them? They are an informal way for you to express whatever ideas you have. They are public, so you can express them to an audience. They don't require planning, or "thinking", and you can say whatever you want. So what's the disconnect here? Why don't people think they can say whatever they want in school? What are the constraints in that environment? How does the audience of a teacher (judge?) affect the message? Why is it easier to write about something that you are assigned to write about in a school form, but to write about whatever you want in a blog? How are people constrained in writing blogs (for example, I don't predict my class will write whatever they want in the blog for our class)  So many questions...

      HTML is wonderful. Do you remember anything about it? Janine's  urlLink HTML tutorial  is one place to start. Probably I learned most of what I know about HTML from doing my website for Gail's class when I manipulated the code to make my funky drop down menu.  As far as adding comments, I just went to  urlLink Haloscan  and followed the directions. You paste it into the places in the code where they say it goes. I showed Joe this weekend and he got it, so I have confidence you can do it also (or at least I can teach it).  Blogging is so interesting. But I can't seem to shake my DVD obsession this morning. My thought about what to do with blogs is start reading everything I can about new media. As blogs are a new genre, I wonder how DVDs are a new genre, in comparison to VHS. The movie watching experience is very different. There are so many different ways to experience the film these days, from extra footage to commentary to short films about the making of the movie to marketing, etc. etc. It's almost like movies have been made into a new genre as well. I suppose this is stuff people are doing, looking at the ways new media makes things into remediated genres. I don't know if I'm truly thinking about something new with this line of thinking. I also think I'd have to structure an entire course around DVDs in order to explore this because there is too much out there. But I wonder if there is a great reading response in this somewhere.  I think the blog qualitative research idea could be great. That is perhaps something that hasn't been done yet with blogs. The person who was writing her dissertation on blogs at the Fem Rhet conference, I don't think she was doing qualitative research. I wonder how Paul would feel about this? We'd have to do a lot more definitive work about what we wanted to do.  Do you think there are other practices we enact in class that students continue to do outside of class? For example, the probably don't webboard all that much, but a lot of people out there do, so you never know. They probably don't write outlines for papers, at least not on average. But are there other practices they might pick up? What do you guys do in your classes in relationship to students' current writing practices (not just in school but in general) Anything? Do you ever have them look at the ways they use writing outside of school?  And why do some groups really take up practices while others don't? For example, no matter how hard I try, I have never been able to get my students to use blackboard to discuss things. Perhaps they didn't really want to discuss the topics I gave them. Sometimes even when they did want to discuss, they didn't really respond to each other. I have not been able to figure out how to work on that.

      What work does a blog do?  What choices do you make in writing one?  What choices/work do you make/do in reading one?  I've been thinking more lately about purposes for blogging -- I mentioned already my six different blogs and their different purposes and audiences.  But I know there's more than that -- I know this because I've had other blogs for different purposes in the past -- one for my novel-in-progress, that served as sort of free internet backup of the text in case my laptop crashed, for example.  I wonder how practical/feasible it would be for us to do some kind of survey of bloggers, the reasons why they blog, the reasons why they blog where and when they do -- would we have to only focus on people with multiple blogs?  That in itself could be a research piece -- writing-in-action/practice kind of thing, sort of a "this is a new genre with new purposes and audiences and motives for action, and this is how those things can work, these are the possibilities for this."  I'd also like to see how *much* writing is done on blogs, in terms of quantity.  I'm thinking about my students' discussion board forums, which aren't technically blogs, but are somewhat analagous.  My 930 class has posted 80 some messages on one board this week, which is literally four times as many as they're required to do.  I'd love to see how much writing that adds up to -- they are already probably over the page requirement for Comp I classes, and it would be neat to see how much work I can get them to do when I make it relevant.  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Ok, so we have all these multiple ideas going and diverse threads -- what do we do with all this?  (Not necessarily a question to be answered now, but something to think about.)

      I'm fascinated by this article on blogs as "  personal knowledge publishing  " (which I think is an interesting term), and the way it talks about blogging as a genre (and the features of that genre, which are not quite what we've identified), and also the history of blogs.  So much to learn, so much to read, so much written on this (surprisingly!).  I could trace links like this all day long, and keep finding new stuff and new angles -- more people are talking/thinking/writing about this than we knew, and many many more than Yancey suspected.  This is exploding right under our fingertips!  (In good ways.)  An excerpt from the above on personal knowledge publishing, on the history of blogs: "In this section I very briefly sketch how weblogging has come about and become a widespread practice on the Internet. More detailed accounts have been written; see this list for references.  Early years The first weblog was Tim Berners-Lee's "What's New?" page at http://info.cern.ch/, which pointed to new Web sites as they came online. The second weblog was Marc Andreessen's "What's New?" page at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (archived here), which performed a similar function until mid-1996.  Several new weblogs appeared with the explosion of the web in 1996-1997. Early weblogs include Dave Winer's Scripting News, Jorn Barger's Robot Wisdom, and Cameron Barrett's CamWorld. Although it is now collectively edited, Rob Malda's Slashdot deserves mention, as it became (and to this day remains) phenomenally popular.   The content of early weblogs was most often a mix of links and commentary that was tailor-made to their editor's taste. Over time, those weblogs built sizable followings because they provided a unique selection of fresh content that appealed to a segment of the online population and because of their personal flavour. The personal nature of early weblogs is captured in Rob Malda's comment, "Slashdot got successful largely because I was my target audience. I wasn't trying to make a site for someone else, I was creating the site that I wanted to read."   The beginning of the "weblog boom"  Most of the first weblogs were home-grown by web designers and software developers, who were the most aware of the capabilities of the technology. In the early years, there existed only a handful of them. In 1999, however, several free or inexpensive weblogging services, such as Pitas, Livejournal, Pyra Labs' Blogger and UserLand's EditThisPage.com, were introduced. As using these systems requires little technical knowledge, the practice suddenly became much more accessible. This resulted in a spectacular growth in the number of weblogs.   There were around a thousand weblogs in mid-2000. As of mid-2002, estimates put the number of weblogs at around a half-million, with the Blogger system alone currently reporting more than 350,000 registered users and creating a new weblog every 40 seconds, or more than 60,000 a month (Steven Levy, Living in the Blog-osphere, August 2002). However, as Rebecca Blood pointed out, many of the new weblogs lean more (if not completely) towards the inward-looking online diary form and would not qualify as weblogs under our definition.   One of the most significant things that happened with the growth of the weblog community is that weblogs became a conversational medium. Many editors would use their weblog to discuss things that had been said by another editor, using links to enable readers to follow threads. Arbitrary numbers of people could participate in such conversations, provided they had their own weblog.   On the surface, this may appear like another incarnation of online many-to-many communication as already implemented in the form of newsgroups or mailing lists. However there is a crucial difference. Since contributions are posted on their author's space, replying to someone else's post does not necessarily mean that the reply will be seen. This has a bearing on the quality of the material that one can find in weblogs, as I will explain shortly.   Another thing that happened during the recent boom was that, as webloggers started reading other people's weblogs, a practice called blogrolling became widespread. The Microcontent News glossary defines a blogrolling list as "The section of a weblog that lists the sites that the blogger reads on a regular basis. This is usually located on the side of a blogger's frontpage, or on a separate page linked off of the frontpage." A unique aspect of these link lists is that they make explicit the social connections that exist among webloggers.    Recent years In recent years, the weblog phenomenon has continued its expansion, and the population of webloggers has become increasingly diverse. Growing numbers of professionals have started weblogging and use them "to reflect upon their work, to follow developments in the field, and to publish ideas" (Mortensen and Walker, 2002). Apart from software developers and web designers, the most well-represented professions in the "blogosphere" are information architects, journalists (starting in the fall of 2002, UC Berkeley is offering a journalism course on weblogging), librarians, lawyers, and education specialists. Knowledge management specialists, information technology consultants and researchers are also increasingly using the medium to engage in conversations about the problems they are trying to solve in their work.  Weblogs are even making incursions in politics. For instance, Tara Sue Grubb, a U.S. politician running for Congress, started a weblog in August. Grubb uses her weblog to enable people to ask her questions about her views on topics important to them, and periodically posts short commentaries, essays or questions to readers. In a sense, her weblog thus provides a space to host a permanent virtual press conference to which everyone is invited. "  Amazing.  Who knew?  This is so unbelievably rich with material and research questions that it's hard to know where to begin - I feel like a kid in a candy store.  Also, a cute post from the Blogger folks about   dating and blogs  , just in time for Valentine's Day. :)

      Well, what about the way we're using blogs for information gathering in another sense?  Not just finding information about people, but creating new information, bouncing around ideas back and forth, etc.  Like Kathleen Yancey was talking about -- I wonder if only communally authored blogs can be used for this?  Which brings up another question: how many purposes can blogs be used for? I have six of them, and one is for a particular audience, one is a private journal on teaching, one is a group bookblog, one is a cooking blog with my best friend, one is something i rarely use anymore, and this one -- they all have different audiences, different purposes...I wonder if I'm alone in this.  Also: we're sitting in the kitchen together right now talking about blogs and I'm typing as we talk.  The intersections in this house between speech, writing, and technology never cease to amaze me.

      Another question: What about blogs for information gathering? I'm thinking about people we know reading each other's blogs to find out personal information to be angry about, internet "yelling" at each other because of something they said on a blog, etc. It's almost like snooping, except it's public.  I also think about (and by the way I would never do this), how once I was looking at my blog on your laptop for some reason (I think I was downloading Framemaker on my computer), and your personal entries showed up. I of course didn't read them, but it's interesting how a public object (or maybe it's a private object) isn't so public, or private at all. And that's the nature of blogs. They are this amazing intersection between what have long been considered strictly public or private practices. But how private are journals anyway? We archive them in libraries, we read them published as books, we sometimes steal each others' for bribery. Interesting interesting.  I also thought about how if someone stumbled on my personal blog, they could probably find out who I was by either the times I've mentioned the University of Illinois or linked to Shawn or E who mention the town, the University, and other such things often. How many Hannahs are there in the English department? Exactly. And if you know my first name and some of my interests, you can find my blog in 10 links on Google. So how private is it? But then again, how public? Who would want to read it? Are my personal thoughts really of that much interest to people? If I'm unimportant, than so is my blog.

      One of my favorite blogging questions of the day:  When talking about a blog with almost all images and very little text: "Is this a blog?" Leading to, what are the conventions of a blog, and is it a blog if it doesn't follow those conventions?  Are blogs truly searchable? In other words, you can't actually find something you're interested in unless you know what you're looking for... Looking at blog archives tells you nothing about where you want to go. So how else could we conceive of archiving other than just chronologically? And is archiving like that possible (I'm sure it is, but we probably don't even think of that) And how does archiving a blog compare to archiving someone's journal in a collection?

      Questions/issues to raise:  Is blogging a new genre Is it feminist? Archiving Communal authorship Blogs v. personal journals Links and hypertext - intertextuality Arrangement - organization - ordered complexity Audience - public/private Response -- comment tools What about audioblogger? How does that impact this media? Blogging as a motivated student activity - a literate practice they don't give up at the end of a semester History of blogs - who developed this? Where did it come from? How has it been taken up since?   I could go on for days, but I won't.  I'm so fascinated, on fire and shaking, with the possibilities of these questions.  Hannah, I think we have the beginnings here of some major serious research questions, some publishable stuff.  (But where? When? How?)

      I wonder if theoretical perspectives like the gaze could be used to think about blogging. A friend was talking about how he was reading this girl's blog because he liked her, and he knew all these things about her like when she got a boyfriend, etc. But I don't think he was posting comments on the blog, just reading it.   So what about voyeurism with blogs? What about people out there who are reading them and not commenting on them? I know my friends, the ones reading and commenting, but there's no requirement to comment, and no reason why one can't follow your every step based on your blog. Interesting, and a bit scary.

      Just found this on a random French blog -- it makes an interesting point (linking blogging to movies, you should enjoy this).  I'll translate it for you as soon as I get a chance.  I'd link to the blog itself, but somehow the links I've found don't work, the server doesn't exist.  (I read this on NetNewsWire, so I haven't actually seen the blog.)  Don't ask me.      Le film Trainspotting a eu un certain succès, mais le terme "trainspotting", lui, n'est connu que de peu de gens. Il s'agit d'une activité à laquelle s'adonnent les chômeurs de la région d'Edimbourg, caractérisée par un certain marasme économique, et qui consiste à passer la journée sur les quais de gares et à y compter le nombre de trains qui arrivent à l'heure, en retard, leurs destinations, leurs changements d'itinéraires, etc. Les trainspotters se font ainsi des carnets de statistiques personnels. Ce n'est certainement pas pire que de sombrer dans la solitude ou l'alcoolisme: au moins cela donne une raison de se lever le matin et ça permet de discuter avec d'autres trainspotters. Ce qui me conduit tout naturellement à faire une analogie avec le blogging. J'ai constaté autour de moi que le fait de blogger est loin d'être l'apanage de ceux qui ont une vie bien remplie (bien que cela puisse être le cas), mais semble plutôt celui d'une tranche de la population qui... s'emmerde: chômeurs, étudiants touristes, personnes dont le travail ne demande pas un grand investissement personnel, etc.  Lire l'article complet proposé par Leced. Difficile de pouvoir encore dessiner une typologie du carnetier ! J'émettrai bien une réserve néanmoins : le carnet est "chronophage" mais me paraît beaucoup moins ennuyeux que la consommation d'autres médias comme la télévision ? Les carnetiers que j'ai pu avoir l'occasion de croiser seraient plutôt des passionnés que des désoeuvrés ?

      Computers and Composition  urlLink blog   A space for  urlLink Blog Research . Looks like we're not the only interested parties...  Someone is teaching a course on blogs and the syllabus is  urlLink online . There is a lot of stuff on this site. Take a look at the syllabus and readings. This guy is at Madison by the way.  Think that's about it for now.

      That professors who blog link is super interesting. Also check out this  urlLink rant  about English majors and law school:  The entry is May 6. Wow. Interesting stuff.  It seems that most professors who blog are fed up with academia and looking for an outlet. Also super interesting. I've been thinking of redoing my blogging, giving it a large overhaul, where I do an academic blog for others to read. My personal blog is well, too personal for that. Plus, even I get a little bored with the "today I did...." stuff. But I'm not interested in only griping about academia. I wonder why they are.

      Interesting -  urlLink this  may raise some interesting questions for you, hannah, in thinking about using blogs in the classroom this summer.    Is this really something we can teach?  We can't teach political activism, can we (political awareness, yes, but not activism)?  Or does someone have to want to blog to be able to learn?    This all sounds very metaphysical (How many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb? One, but the lightbulb has to  want  to change.), but I think you see my point.
