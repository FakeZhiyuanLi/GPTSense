      Aside from the fact that it make the URL easy to remember?  Because I can't imagine life without the Muchos Pollos.  The Muchos Pollos were a basement band, in the most literal sense.  They played 5 gigs in their career -- one in a backyard, and four in a basement.  The Muchos Pollos, while not cutting edge original, they were a band that brought the masses together.  It was high school, and the Pollos fans cut through several different cliques of friends, which is quite a statement.  If you grew up in the area, you understand what a feat that is.  While during the week at school people might not like each other the least bit, they'd put their differences aside for an hour and a half, every half a year, to enjoy watching these five boys sweat to the oldies.  This is all true, but in all honesty, the reason that it's the Muchos Pollos Memorial Website is that I didn't want to call it "Ryan's Blog" or anything generic like that.  But I'm happy to talk about the Pollos until the cows come home.  And despite the fact that I'm in Wisconsin, it could be awhile.

      Beep.  I'm debating something in my head.  Am I a follower, or is it just that everybody else has good ideas?  Everyone and their moms have blogs these days.  This is just the latest in a long line of things that I've been late getting into.  Previous entries on the list include...  - Cell phones - Texas Hold 'Em - Law and Order  The conclusion that I've come to is that I'm not a follower.  While there are some trendy things that I dig, there are quite a few "popular" things that I despise.  Previous entries on that list include...  - Starbucks - Reality Tv - Chicago Cubs  Ok.  I now present to you, the Muchos Pollos Memorial Blog.  Check out all its majesty!

      Yes, the first gig.  Very low budget.  The band could not even afford a roof over their heads.  They could not afford valet parking for their guests.  The bouncer was Justin's dog.  The band members took turns at the merchendise booth, selling whatever they could scrounge up.  Broken guitar strings, strands of hair, et all.  This wasn't like a show at Merriweather Post Pavillion.  Oh no.  It was outside, but it was outside on Justin's patio.  The distance between the band and the rabid fans was miniscule.  Though, there was not a bad seat in the house.  Except for the one with wobbley legs.  That wasn't a good seat.  There was an air of apprehension at the first gig.  The band didn't know what to expect.  The audience didn't know what to expect.  The neighbors didn't know what to expect.  The weather didn't know what to expect.  The show had the potential to be a disaster, a huge triumph, or something the recording academy would recall as a nice first step.  The Pollos were a trio for this show.  While the three did exchange instruments a few times during the show (thus beginning their trademark versitility), Ryan played most of the guitar and sang most of the songs, Justin played drums, and Russ tickled the electronic ivories.  While the setlist never found it's way to the Muchos Pollos archives, it is believed that the first ever Muchos Pollos song was "American Music" by the Violent Femmes.  Other hits of the night included, but were not limited to...  - It's the End of the World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine) - REM - Man On The Moon - REM - Blister In The Sun - Violent Femes - Oh Pretty Woman - Roy Orbison - I'm so Tired - Beatles - Creep - Radiohead  When all was said and done, 12 songs were played, and no fruits or vegetables were thrown at the band during the course of the show.  The cops were not called to the scene, though we had a great story planned for them if they had showed up.  There is no bootleg copy of this show.  No audio tape, no video tape, no CD, no DAT, no nuthin.  If you ask the band, they will likely say that it's just as well.  There was vast improvement over the rest of the bands career.  But in a historical perspective, it is a shame that a copy does not exist.  The post-gig meet and greet was held inside Justin's house, where we sat around and did pretty much nothing.  No autographs were signed.  No sex, no drugs.  But we did have rock and roll.  And all the people in attendence agreed that a second gig would be worth the while.  And so, there was.

      You know, some of the traitorous masses of the Potomac high school music listening public may have forgotten the days of Muchos Pollos, but having been present at the very first basement concert of this energetic and personable band, all I can say is that those fickle freddies is, EAT DIRT!  There lives in every beat of this loyal heart an undying affection for the days of the chickens, and though the band itself was short lived, the message of the music lives forever.  Sweet dreams are made of THEE, Muchos Pollos.  I'd rather sweat to your oldies than lounge to to the tunes of anybody else.  Never forget, I am your biggest and first fan!
