      *big brother accent*  Day 2 in the cape town lodge and everyone slept into 10am, being woken by the coldness, weird noise from said donkey or Viv banging on the door. Big brother decided to play a trick on the housemates by making the showers unnescesarily(sp?) cold!!!!  The team left on time(at last) at 11:30 heading for the Churches Choir festival. The team arrived but the choirs didnt until 2 hours later. Once the festivities began the team joined in the dancing and attmpted to "sing". All hopes of sounding good were dashed when the choirs split off into millions of harmonies(quote from Rachel). The team departed at 5, after 2 and a half hours of the part-ay!  Team Dassie "Cooked like demons" and made enough sweet and sour stir fry to "feed the hostel 3 times over"(courtesy of Rachel yet again)  All the housemates remain in good spirits and await the arrival of the new housemate Katy P(a.k.a "The Originator!")  *Big brother theme tune*  Credits: Team hedgehog (weeee....splat splat splat) Sues, Rachel and Phil  Prayer Points: *Katy P's travel, safe arrival and the strength to make it through the Church service. *That the food tomorrow at the Church will accomodate all needs(shall we say as most of you know the state of some members health!) *Strength for the week ahead and as we prepare for the tasks set for us. *That God will put upon each of our hearts the place that we should be during the next week(ie. the school or the HIV orphanage) *Anything else you consider relevant(oh and that the weather will get a tad warmer and less cold as we are all getting quite cold!)

      this is a bit of a catch up but anyway.  Arrived yesterday to sunshine but a welcoming bed.  Went to hosts house last nite for a bit of a welcoming party, the classic SA meal...baked potato, baked beans and mince!! They shared their prospects for the trip and their own testimony about how they ended up running a school in Capetown.  Early to bed to make up on some very precious lost sleep.  30th July 2004 Weather: wet and windy foggy and dark!! Up at 6:30am (ish).  went to school via one of Viv's famous "i know where im going" shortcuts.  Arrived at school eventually to a warm reception.  children all very welcoming and not afraid of meeting us.  we all met the pastor of the church where the school is held.  Some of us went to actual classes to help out and bond with the kids more with some well earn't football at break time.  School day finished early today because its friday.  After school we went to orphange/ HIV hostle. (!?)  some of us will be spending a few days here helping paint and spruce the place up a little while others do the same at school on monday. weather starting to look up.  Pray for: team time tonight that it will smoothly and that we can come up with some good ideas for camp and assemblies and ministry etc.  Prayer for Katy Ps travel, its a long story if u don't know...talk to chrisby!! Youth festivel tomorrow at church, that we won't make too much fools of ourselves! General preparation and team bonding!

      10 days to go - we are all feeling quite scared and excited all at the same time. Everything is running along nicely and no major catastrophes yet!  The idea of the blog is so that people will be able to keep up with what we are doing in Cape Town. Each day a team member or a few team members will be charged with updating the blog with what has been going on that day. It will get some of our thoughts down on "paper" and will also let everyone who is interested know what&nbsp;we've been up to for information and for prayers. &nbsp; Hopefully we will be able to upload photos to the blog mas well which would be rather cool. Won't know to we get out there though. &nbsp; Viv

      Tuesday Back to the gridstone of 6:30 starts! J YAY! Arrived at school to have to kick in 2 of the classroom doors. So went out to get two new ones! Meantime another wall was cleaned and the rest of the team were in classes, expectally as lucia ( one of the teachers) was sick so we were a bit thin on the ground. She wont be back all week so its gonna be a hard week of doing lessons. Rachel was also feeling  bit sick so she had the day off and her and Katy got to have a lie in! But the day was gorgeous and everyone felt a bit better now that the weather had picked up. Also the beautiful tea and coke and chocolate cake helped!  Wednesday Were a bit late but still made it on time got to watch the sunrise and ended up taking extreme photos out the car window… was so pretty. Doors got sized and fitted today in the beautiful sunshine. Wall got painted and classes ran … well mostly quite smoothly! Back at lodge out tonight at Celia’s cell group so having an early tea in the lovely sun! J   Prayer requests… Lucia – that she gets better Sun – that it stays Kids – that they will be happy but calm for classes Team – that we all don’t die of the cold… it could happen!

Sunday - went to Khayelitsha church in the morning and in the afternoon we planned lessons for the coming week! in the evening we went to the Vineyard 'Breathe' service - the first thereof! it was pretty much the same as our usual Sunday nite praise service. was refreshing to have an english spoken service and it was wat the whole team needed.

Tuesday - weather is great (even sum of us in shorts). hopefully will get back to u tomorow about the rest of our day! team are working well together and all is good!!  Prayer points:-  1.

      Sorry for this being late and short but this internet is not very good and nearly finished typing it all out then got disconnected and lost it all! :(  boo so take 2! if you forgive us for not posting we will be sure to do it everyday from now on! Things have just been a bit mad trying to settle in.  Sunday  7:30 to go to church where we were greeted by MANY different handshakes and hugs. Viv and Susie went down to get Katy P (cue the music) from the airoport. The rest of us had to dance up to the front to give collection. Mystery 20E note was put in not naming names (someone with a birthday between july and December and is really tall…). Sermon was very “energetic” and in Kosa but what we could understand though our interpreters was really good! At the end we got to sing and dance with the choir and were their outfits, special mention to dave, phil, katy, Susie and Rachel for solo dances! Made us a good lunch of chicken curry and mystery pudding from woolworths! Back to lodge and Katy P produced (as if from nowhere) some letters from home and presents for us all – most random being pink marigolds for Phil?!?  Was beautiful weather so played outside and Dave managed to burst a small childs ball- TK’s L boooo Dave. Had good food and random humour from a book in the logde – if you eat something and noone else sees it, it has no calories!  Monday 6:30 start Katy woken with bacon buddy sandwich. Early for school so got to watch sunrise! Ummm… sandwich making timetabling followed once school started. Learnt Many new clapping games at break which was great fun. Classes and timestables proved a problem! Birthday celebration for Katy included singing, dancing, prayers, pressies and cake for everyone! More games and then classes with |PE and art for the little ones.  Some people helped clean the church hall walls for painting later.  The kids love hair braiding but usually ends up in knots and also had problems getting them to leave so that we could!   We arrived back at lodge to get ready to go out again for katy’s birthday dinner. Gemma was first in the shower when we got back and katy didn’t manage to get a shower due to water being freezing but dave and viv played Xstream Frisbee.  Rachel and Tegan managed to climb out the van window followed by suzanna and amber on arrival back at lodge!  Left lodge by 5 to take roundabout drive through traffic jams to restaurant via beach to watch sunset behind table mountain and to play with the waves, involving people getting wet!  Crossed the road to have a beaut meal that was sooo cheap and katy flirted with the waiter so got extra chips and a birthday song and dance from staff!  On the way back to lodge viv drove on a mystery tour up to signal hill where we looked out over Cape Town on all sides and returned via roads that ended nowhere and in mid-air! Also had a really short team time and then headed to bed after many games on ‘tedious links’ on the way home, the best being Gene Hackman to Keanu Reeves.   Viv’s time trial from entrance of complex to lodge was an impressive time of 1:03!  Tuesday   6:30 start (again) meant excessive sandwich making resulting in dave having no lunch L but he still managed to lead us all in a nice warm up session of aerobics! Classes in the morning meant that gemma got to count with teddy bears and dave did more maths, proving his hidden talent of being a teacher!  Painting commenced.  We taught the kids how to play Hokey Kokey at lunch and had battles to get them out to stop paint being ruined.  Dave, suzanna, tegan and phil lead drama and music about Zacchaeus which worked really well and kids enjoyed themselves.  Went to ‘pick and pay’ hypermarket after school to shop and bought loads of food, katy was bought a ‘mega flirt’ magnum ice-cream.  Went to Celias for tea, coffee nd biscuits, and reviewed how everything had gone.  Back to lodge for a 2 hour wait before a well worth it chicken and broccoli bake J YUM!!!!!  Team time with chocolate cake and cuppa tea.   Time trial- 1:03    Prayer for: organizing classes over the weeks, surviving with out home comforts, the kids in the school and the teachers who have so much to do! Team sanity!  Well there you go folks hope your having as much fun as we are.  Hope you are all well and surviving with out us, everyone is missing……………………………everyone! xxx

      Just a quick post. Only posting today as we couldn't get onto the internet yesterday due to the office being closed. Katy P joined us (the plane was an hour late) and we introduced ourselves to the church. It was only a three hour service with lots and lots of singing. We got most of it translated. After that we got to sing with the youth choir. When I say sing - we danced and tried to pick up the words in Xhosa but were not very successful! They had a welcome meal for us afterwards - Chicken curry and rice.   After lunch we went back to the accomadation to do a lot of planning and preparation and we had our first afernoon of good weather! Before that it had been very very cold and wet - quite miserable.   Anyway - 'm sure that this evening someone else will be on this to update from today (Monday)  Viv
