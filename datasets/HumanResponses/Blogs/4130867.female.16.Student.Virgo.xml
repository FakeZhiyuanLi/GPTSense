        Friday, 20th of August- I dreamt bout JC last night. arghhh..i seriously thought i've forgotten all about him. i thought my feelings for him have faded away and it's no longer there in my heart. i was so wrong! little did i realise that deep inside me i still have hopes for him, of us together. now thoughts bout him running back in my mind. about everything in the last few years. everything he said and the way he is all along. in that dream, we are together. it was so vivid and clear, it was so real. it's almost not like a dream at all. but i know very well how dreams dont come true. and i know how things would never work out between us. the way that hes vulnerable, that i can hurt him, that love is like playing with fire and the fact that im still so young. and the other reason probably bout his dad. now i kept thinking bout him. i kept thinking bout him. i know i shouldnt. things are never going to turn up the way i want them too. i'll be giving hopes to myself, false hopes. and when i have hopes i know i'll eventually disappoint myself sooner or later. i dont understand why does he has to be so nice. so that he can give me hopes and destroy it in split second? arghh.....i know now that i still like him a lot. it has been a long time since the last time we kept in touch. i distant myself and him cos each time we are close, i'll like him all over again. its hurting me a lot. so i chose not to be close to him and forget bout him. i thought ive made it... until recently my dreams woke me up. right now, i longed for the hours we spent talking and chatting on the phone, i longed to hear his voice, the way that he understands everything bout me, the way he cares about my life. i miss those days when we stayed up all night on the phone, talking, laughing. i feel the need to talk to him right now. I MISS HIM~!!!!!

        Monday, 16th of August. Recently, I met someone. ooh ok... not just someone. it's a guy. well its not a big deal actually, only that after all these time of not having dramas in my life made me feel as though it has been such a long time since i met someone new! but its not like im head over heels with him. maybe the emptiness inside  me is taking much more control of me than my feelings do! maybe... Anyway, his name is W*** and he's 25. hes not really a very nice guy, at least not the good type. he's kinda bad and he likes me becos im bad too. haha~ But then again, I will never love him. i wouldnt mind having fun though. just no strings attach. i know how agony love can be and i dont wanna be someone's toy.Giving in to sweet words and great actors. ooooh, im just aint that stupid anymore.i dont wanna waste my tears and my feelings any longer. i like someone's companion and i really wouldnt mind using him a lil. wicked me~

       Thursday, 12th August 2004- today is just like any other normal day. Nothing special i guess. nothing happened so far and nothing will to probably. just finished my physics paper today and I am that damn glad man~ Ive always been very bad in physics but today's paper wasn't THAT terrible actually. Ive expected something worse but luckily it ain't that tough. but lets not be over confidence though. I'm sure it wouldnt turn out good, as it had always been. gRrr how i hate physics and additional maths. in da future i guess i wouldnt be doing much of a blogging anymore, I'll be so busy in the next few months. exams, exams and daT biG daY in November. my life is now a much more plain, calm, peaceful road. no more series of never-ending dramas going on haha~ at least not for now. Im just so super sick of everything that happened in the past before. u people can just leave me alone.

       The angel from my nightmare    The shadow in the background of the morgue   The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley    ~   This sick strange darkness    Comes creeping on so haunting every time    ~   You've got your dumb friends   I know what they say   They tell you I'm difficult   But so are they   They don't know me   Do they even know you?   All the things you hide from me   All the shit that you do   ~   It's nice to know that you were there   Thanks for acting like you cared   And making me feel like I was the only one   I  t's nice to know we had it      Thanks for watching as I fall   And letting me know we were done

        argH~!! these past few days have been so traumatic. i've been so not-well, sick! ive eaten something wrongly and therefore face the consequences of an aching-stomach and non-stopping vomiting. the pain comes and goes naturally but it hurts so much! luckily now it has calm down a lil. omg! ive been so idle these few days... a lotus eater i might say? hahaa... yeah didnt eat, didnt bathe, didnt do anything. completely idling the whole time! its like im hibernating. i dont even have da appetite to eat, though luxurious food were served right in front of my naked eyes! im glad its allrite now... im a lil weak but its better than the yesterdays. taught me a lesson though. NEVER. never to pick any food that simple anymore!

        my past relationships was a total waste of time, energy, feelings and emotions. guys are so guys! they can be so nice when they want to and when they want something out from you. but theyre actually not! not at all! ive learnt the true nature of guys and ive vowed never to get into those messy dramas anymore, never to shed a tear for those muthafuckers anymore. theyre just aint worth it. no matter how nice they can be now, it can never lasts. i dont wana get involved in those serious relationships anymore. right now its fun and fun and fun! i dont wanna be loyal to a special someone who can hurt me one day. i know how vulnerable love can make a person and i aint gonna be vulnerable no more. no guys are worth my love and feelings. im not that stupid anymore. ive learnt the hard ways. my priorities changed and i looked at things differently now. i know what i want and im gonna get it!
