      Hey Thomas - we missed you...we had an interesting discussion on the atomic bomb...the pushing of sugar is very interesting...comparable to the big companies making money off adolescents at Skyview - disguised as Vending Machines and Food Products....  Mr. Ray wants to be invited to our US History Blog - and I have the list of sixth period students.

       Just some interesting things to note from Henretta about WWII Rationing:  "People found it especially hard to cut back on sugar.....the manufacturers of products such as Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum received unlimited quantities fo sugar by convincing the government tha their products helped the morale of the men and women in the armed forces". Woooooooo we are really really a nation addicted to sugar.  But what's more interesting: "Congress imposed a nationwide speed limit of 35 miles per hour...as a result, highway death rates dropped dramatically." WOW!!!!! Speed limit NATIONWIDE at 35 mph.......Man in today's lightning pace stressful lives......Such a speed limit would certainly kill off lots of people!!!!!!!!!!

       Unfortunately, Ms.Clark, I will be gone all day tomorrow (for MUN) and on Friday (for NWSE), and both days are apparently discussion days. But hopefully you or some other students can post interesting discussion topics here to keep me and others who will be absent informed.   I do believe that there are lessons to be learned in history so to avoid similar conflicts, patterns, and cycles of violences (otherwise there is no point in enthusiastically studying history). Things do occur in similar way just because of natural ways of human interactions, reactions, and emotions.   And that the dropping of the atomic bomb poses an interesting question and potential debate. I personally don't have a strong opinion of that right now simply because it's such a complex issue.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to invite all the talkative sixth period students to this discussion blog!

      Hey - very interesting tidbits...Thomas thank you for starting the AP Blog - American foreign policy is very complex - I wonder what would have happened if American intervened in the Spanish American War - would World War II erupted earlier - would Hitler's Final Solution been avoided or defeated before the horrible consequences.  It is so easy to make or critique our past and qualify it as a mistake.  I have never really understood the quote..."we must remember our past so we aren't condemned to repeat it ."  We will never be able to repeat the past...it is so different...however we continue to behave as humans do? How can we repeat something that is so different - or do we repeat the same instances with superior technology.     "Under God" - did you know they added that phrase in the 50s during the cold war?  America's rally around Freedom...Goodness and Godliness...Cold War propaganda?   I enjoyed reading your blogs - What are your thoughts on America's decision to drop the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?    Prediction: On the fifty year anniversary of Brown vs. Board of Education (1954) - Portland will host a major racial riot....Topic "TALK"  See you tommorow

         Isn't it a sad state that the Fascist National forces won the Spanish Civil War? The Loyalists, being the Republican-elected govt., get supported by only Mexico and the USSR, while the US, Britain, and France keep their sympathies at home. I applaud those who went over to aid the Loyalists. I have yet to read much lit on this period (Hemingway's "For Whom the Bell Tolls" is now on my shelf, unread, but certainly on deck). George Orwell's "Homage to Catalonia" would be good too. I read a short, interesting excerpt from it where Orwell described himself meeting an Italian peasant. A communist soldier, a simple man, and one fighting against the government of his country to fight for his beliefs. It was interesting to consider that even some Germans and Italians, whose governments were supporting Franco's Nationalist rebellion, were joining the Loyalists to fight the spread of Fascism. It's like the Domino Effect theory in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, but also like the end of that conflict, the "villanous" form of govt. fought against (Communist) didn't spread beyond far beyond Vietnam. Anywho, and the lack of help from democracies causes the Republican collapse, and Franco's brutal reign goes from 1939-1975; 36 years! Gee, and the policies of neutrality and appeasement certainly didn't help in Spain, or in Czechoslovakia for that matter. Or in Poland, etc. "It just goes on and on and on."    Does anyone need an extra id partner. I'm trying to get an exchange going for this new test. Anywho, see you all later, hopefully. I'd like to see what you think on this above blurb. Didn't the quote before signing into this thing say "for people who have lots to say"? Goodbye all. Adios and God bless you.                                                             Yeehawman,                                                               (Tristan)

      Nicely written, Thomas. I don't understand why some people find that they must make a big stink about a two word phrase. If they don't want to say it, then they shouldn't say it. That's why the first amendment is there. It protects freedom of speech, and the freedom of not-speech. So if you don't want to say something, you're welcome to not say it. Don't start suing people because you don't want your kid to say it. I agree that little kids should know about the pledge, but forcing them to say something they don't know the meaning to is not right. If you want people to say the pledge, at least have the decency to teach them what it means first.

      To deviate only a little away from wars and genocide,  urlLink Mr.Wargo's class blog has got up there the really controversial debate of the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance, and especially the "Under God" phrase.  And don't blame me for spilling over that debate to this blog, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations.  As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the "Under God" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about.....  What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards.   And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear.  What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the "majority" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good).   Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber.   And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists.   And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others.  Differences of opinions is good!  Thomas Chen

      It's been too long since I posted in a Blog. I even had to create a new account, because my last one was unused for so long. Anyway, Today was interesting. I knew that the old cartoons were about wartime stuff. So many of them showed people buying warbonds, or ditching the drafting, or something to do with war, but cartoon Hitler was still funny...

      Heh Interesting AP Exam Data for AP U.S. History: Last year's AP Exam statistics: Average Score 2.73, (compared to 2.78 for World History (which Emerson's class nailed the exam), and 2.69 for Comparative Politics/Government).  Response to matt: Hmmmmmm wait, maybe not many people are interested, but then there are those few who are really interested, and for them, it's a chance for them to burst their feelings out........

      Very insightful comments...I wish more students would take the time to think about what they learned - you did a nice job synthesizing the information and taking it to formulate your viewpoints on the time period. Nice procees - and you allowed me to see it which makes it more fun.  I hope others are wrestling with the information to help them support their understanding of the world.  That is the best way to go about learning history - there is no way you can remember everything but the more information you acquire will help you formulate your own viewpoints.  It is called epistimology...(Look it up)  You did it perfectly - I am not sure I spelled it correctly.     Kailie - I am glad you loved Sam's lecture.  I hope you see his generetional view points - Change over time...I am not sure Sam's view points change - (women, Communism, Freedom, America)  but they are fun to examine as he continues to teach history.    Sunday   Segment 1 - 1800-1846 Republican Revolution to the Election of Polk Segment 2 - 1846 to the Civil War Segment 3 - Reconstruction/ The Guilded Age  If you guys can continue to reveiw your multiple choice while going through the study guide it should help.   We also have Tues, Wed, Thursday to sharpen our saw.    Keep working and thinking - make connections.   Clark

      Well, I'd like to do anything but that essay.  I think we've had enough Centuries to do well on the test, but I'd like to finish the series later.  Cause like Kolk said, Peter Jennings is one sexy hunk of man.  I'd like to tear into him like Sam and his Sheila (that's Aussie for "girl").  Just kidding about all that, but I really enjoyed Sam's lecture today.  He's very intelligent, understands what went on and why, and can relay it to a bunch of high-school kids very effectively which is tough to do.  I think the key is boot camp and that drill instructor that's itching to get out... keeps us on our toes.  The lecture really effected my views about the time period.  It drives me crazy that the era that produced The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Who and Miss Clark would also deem it noble to spit on a soldier who risked his life fighting for freedom.  That may sound distorted/cliche (even to the vets), but the troops were there because the government told them to be...the government that feared the domino effect, and that if Asia went down to communism, trade ceases, America chokes on its own success in a ridiculous recession no military might could pull us out of, then the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWII, and every other conflict we've participated in under the banner of freedom and democracy would have all been for nought.  It is so prevalent to Iraq... Bush riding terrorism to attack a country that could foster terror... but it makes me think "what about Saudi Arabia?"  like, 4/6 or something of the 9/11 bombers were  Saudi.  And what about Palestinian groups like Hamas and Al Aqsa Martyr Brigade?  Are they not also equally important to the war on terror, despite the fact they are attacking Israeli Jews rather than American ones?  Sam's lecture also helped shape my political views.  Kerry fought in Vietnam, won a silver star for valor as he captained a boat in the hottest of zones in the heart of Vietnam, Bush skipped out on the National Guard.  Although military experience does not ensure quality presidency (Grant), Eisenhower seems to have done a job well done.  I also get the impression that being surrounded by death, Kerry might be more hesitant to send in troops, he might carry a higher appreciation for the life of a soldier.  I was going to ask Sam about it, but we ran out of time.    Give me your thoughts on Nam, communism, Sam, or political oppinionism.  Good luck on the test, and good luck to SJClark in Seattle!  Love, Rob

      Well, Clark, I just have to say i LOVED Sam's lecture today, and im really not being sarcastic either! I think I'm really starting to feel the pressure of the test coming up, but i think as long as we continue to have review after school, I'll survive. I will definitely be at school on Sunday from 1-4, but what are we working on? I think the era that i need to work on the most is during the 1800s...pretty much the entire century has become a blur to me. But im feeling confindent about the 1600s and definitely the 1900s, and im starting to understand the 1700s better as we've been talking about it during the review sessions. See you all tomorrow! Oh yeah, and Rob, dont ditch me on Friday morning...i coming to your house at the crack of dawn whether or not youre awake!  Kailie

      Rob - Thanks for the compliment...did I say something funny.  Tomorrow we will move forward through the revolution and constitution and hopefully get the Republian Revolution and the era of good feeling.  I appreciate the feedback.  On friday I have a job interview in Seattle...Not that I have enough to do this week...but I am very excited about the prospect.    Friday - I could give you a multiple choice test again - or an essay prompt - or review - or centuries...Please use your review guide and review the Multiple Choice questions that you missed.   SUNDAY - AP study session 1 - 4 THE 1800s...Can people make it at this time?  Monday you guys have the test and the rest of the week we will review...  Essay prompt:   John Winthrop's goal was to create a "City Upon a Hill"?  Like John Winthrop, Jefferson believed Americans had a special destiny and responsibility: "The eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety upon us as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and...our falling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of self government."  This was the Republican vision of the City Upon the Hill. If Americans were to be a virtuous people, would all of the people in the new nation be allowed to become American?  Throughout history how and why have Americans struggled to live up to these principals?   I need a Muchas Gracias Burritto.  Ms. Clark

      Clark- have you thought about a career in standup?  I know you have your administrative internship, but drop it all and head for Hollywood!  Maybe then you could afford to be a principal in Napa.  Thanks a lot for all the reviews- they beat the hell out of Henretta, which is nice because me and him aren't as acquainted as we could be.  Do you think we could start reviewing Jackson through WW1 era?  That seems to be the blankest for me, except for the slavery aspects of it.  Maybe one more essay practice somewhere would be gravy if you could fit it in... maybe a take home one that we could review?  To all my peers- keep on trucking.  The test is coming up fast, but we can study even faster.  GOOD LUCK!  Love, Rob

      Yes...I thank Jessica for those life magazines...one is the year of 72 in picutres..  The other has the cover of the Kennedy family at JFK's funeral and of course my favorite...1969 Neil Armstrong walks on the moon...Guess what the Mercury seven were furious they weren't chosen to be the one who walked on the moon - they picked Neil...He must have had the "RIGHT STUFF" -  By the way I have been so thirsty for a glass of tang.  I will make sure to bring those in...  Those in 6th period I am going to start at 7:00 am on Wednesday because Sam is going to lecture about Vietnam...Boys bring doughnuts and girls bring juice and cups and I will bring coffee...  Also - the mornings of Thursday and Friday I am with Ms. Winters - we are going to go over 6 to 7 American art slides and then do an art project - There was an Andy Warhol question two years ago...she said it was fine if we wanted to review on the balcony or the side room.  Cheers - I am going to the gym.  Clark

      Hey APUSH - we had some great success on our AP multiple choice test - however, I know many of you are disappointed.  The good news we have two weeks to raise those scores. Last year we only had a couple students over 40 at one week prior to the test. It is not time to panic - instead go over twenty multiple choice questions a day - even some that you got right you still need to work on.  Antebellum - Pre-Civil War - this term is often used to refer to the golden age of the south.  Andrew Melon - Treasurer under the Harding administration - you know the roaring twenties were about big business and handsoff government  Evan Cate can give you all the information  Essay Prompts - Most answered the essay - How did the Civil Rights Movements of the 50s and 60s address the failures of reconstruction?  I think you could look at supreme court decisions - Plessy V Ferguson - Brown V Board of Education  Presidential Decisions - Eisenhower sent in troops, Johnson and congress supported to important pieces of legislation while Hays made deals to take the troops out.  Excellent leaders and movements that addressed the issues head on...Desegregating schools, facilities, voter registration drives...all of the issues that the radical republicans wanted for the freedmen but failed to achieve...I think it is also important to think about the television and media.  The movement relied on the sympathy of nonsoutherners...the television allowed for the brutality to be seen and not just told.  All of these are applicable events - Brown V Board, Montgomery Bus Boycott, Little Rock Nine, Jackie Robinson, Desegregation of Military Forces, SNCC, Sit Ins, Freedom Marches, Freedom Rides, CORE, March on Washington, Stokely Carmichael,  Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voters Rights Act of 1965...Remember to use events to support your point and ideas - do not describe the events.  Your readers are intelligent people and describing the Montgomery Bus Boycott is insulting.  How did anti - communism, the silent majority or the women's movement shape American public life....  Most NAILED the anti-communism in the fourties and fifties...you should have established the fear...Soviet Expansion, Eastern Europe, Berlin Blockade, Berlin Airlift, Truman Doctrine, Eisenhower, Korean War, Red China ....  But how did it affect American Life - fear of communism and subversion - McCarhyism, HUAC, Black Lists, Bomb Shelters, NSA, NASA, Space Race, Interstate Highway system, Math and Science stressed in schools, Arms Race, Competitive with Russians...  Silent Majority was a group of "hard-working" middle class Americans who were sick of the protests and the violence of the sixties and seventies...In support of Nixon's back to Normalcy - Good Americans, Anti - Drugs, Back to American Values....Voted in Nixon and led a stance against the chaos and hardships of the sixties and early seventies.  In fact one poll believed only 11% of Americans sided with the kids at Kent State and the rest supported the Natinal Guard.  - this was the hardest one...  Feminist Movement - Betty Friedan - there is more to life for a woman...the birth control pill, protests at Miss American Contests...again a group met the "establishment" head on to make changes in the work force, at colleges, and made it acceptable for women to have a career...prior to the movment - job sector divided...changed the family units two income households and may have contributed to the divorce rates...ERA, Title 9 and Roe versus Wade...are all good things to include.  I promise I won't eat the entire pint of ice cream if you promise not to freak out and do intentional focused studying each night.  Have a good evening.  Steph

      Good Morning...Thomas I think the segregation process is a fascinating story. It appears that all the efforts in the sixties may have been futile because our society is segregated based on economics and race.  Racial and ethnic segregation has been a phenomenon from the beggining of America's story.  The Irish, Chinese, Italians, Koreans, the Russians immigrate and create communities.  It seems like the etnic cultures eventually  "melt" into mainstream society after a generation or two  but people with racial differences haven't.  Then their is the Native American story where they were placed in communities together for convenience and their own preservation.   During the seventies there was a movement to desegregate called "bussing".  You see an example in the Denzel Washington movie Remember the Titans.  It failed miserably.  Now with "No Child Left Behind" legislation allows for students to leave their failing school to attend another.  You tell me - where would all the students from Skyview go if it failed?  It is funny - when I was in school we were deemed "The Nation at Risk"   - Regan administration.  Now it is NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND...  I am getting to ready to read your prompts...I will post some information on how you did as a class.  A good thing to examine to finish your studies of modern time is to take Kennedy - Camelot, Johnson - The Great Society, Nixon - Back to Normalcy,  Carter - ? and Regan administration and make sure you look at what they stood for politically, on domestic and foriegn policies...Watergate, Opec, The Iran Contra Affair, The Camp David Accords, Reganomics, Star Wars...  I am working on a review...

      I feel this is a great article that everybody should read:  urlLink   Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v. Board decision  It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology.  I would like to hear  everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue.

      Ok, Ms.Clark, I had to delete all of those erroneous testing posts. And by the way, for any of you who may have trouble publishing your posts, after you click "publish blog", please do not hit the back key, for it may erase your post entirely.   In reading Henretta, I found it interesting that today's leisurely clothingstyles largely stemmed from the counterculture radical movements: when young men started to wear "coats and ties and women skirts and sweaters", and "youth defiantly dressed in unisex ragged blue jeans". This provides a great contrast to the clothingstyles of "old days" when even in the 50s everybody was still wearing very uptight clothes and the kids in school had to wear tight uniforms.   And  urlLink here is a link that may bring about some shock about the current cost of war in Iraq. I was surprised and never put into perspective how much money that cost of the war came to be .

      Took a while, but I liked the extra credit movie the other night a lot! I thought that it showed the attitude of the time period pretty well. America was trying so hard to beat Russia in the "space race," and I didn't realize it was that important to a lot of people. I also liked how it showed how much people liked the Kennedy's. I think it was Guss's wife who got totally emotional because she didn't get to meet Jackie.  I have to agree with Ms. Clark that astronauts are totally hott after seeing this movie.  I enjoyed my first extra credit movie night. Thanks! Xoxo,  Jess Knab

      The movie tonight was alright.. it took too long to get going, but maybe that was just me. In response to Ms. Clark's questions...... Perhaps the reason that Cooper couldn't say Yeager, is that at that stage in America, we wanted to see leaders and such on TV, not someone who wants to take his time explaining about some other guy's abilities.  The news people were wanting him to hurry with his explaination, and perhaps it was faster to just say himself. Also, another answer could be, that he was scared that if he didn't show confidence in his own abilities as a pilot, NASA would have chosen the guy he suggested. If the nation sees an astronaut reccommend that he is not the best pilot, they would be upset that he is flying a space craft their tax dollars went into creating; they would want someone who is ready to go into space.   I think that the main point of this film was to show that during the Cold War, personal victories boosted the nation's morale. For a very large portion of the nation, breaking the sound barrier meant nothing or little to them. Yet the media played this off as some great event. While sending 1 person into space was a landmark event for the US, it became more and more dramatized each time... everytime a new astronaut went up, they "pushed the envelope farther than before." But each time they orbited the earth a few more times than before, it was made out to be an enormous event. This surprised me, because if I was living back then, I don't think I'd care if someone went two more times around the Earth than the person before him. I think the directors were trying to show that maybe some events during the Cold War were made out to be bigger than they actually were. I felt that they were successful in this (unless my analysis is wrong). They showed how dramatized these events were....  Wooo Getting kinda late... i should be shuffling off to bed like an hour ago...  ~Mat "Ralph" Keksi signing off

      I enjoyed the movie tonight, although the editors should be shot in the face.  The flick portrayed the Cold War attitude- the fun side of it.  Frank and I were talking about how fun it would be to have that kind of competition with another nation... where every American triumph feels like a personal victory.  Aside from the brief period of time after 9/11, I don't think I've ever felt the sort of American comradery and patriotism that appeared in The Right stuff.  The homage paid to the test pilot was a little time consuming, but touching to see Yager continue to risk his life because it was his job and what he liked to do even if it were overshadowed by the space race.  Lastly, seeing Jeff Goldblum, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, the crazy guy from Vertical Limit, and the hick in Tremors  as such young guys was also fun.  I hope that the extra credit incentive for posting tonight begins a trend on this blog.  Also, respond to the posts Tom and I wrote earlier.  Love Rob  P.S.  Thanks for the excelent review this afternoon, Clark

      In response to the question about gender roles, I believe that the movie's portrayal of the responsibilities of women during that era was quite accurate.  Throughout the movie the wives of the to be astronauts were depicted as obedient to their husbands even if this was not in compliance with their personal feelings.  The prime example of such characterization was demonstrated in the scene where the astronauts were being interviewed by the press and the question arose of how the astronaut's wives felt about their husbands going into space.  In response, all the astronauts replied that their spouses supported them 100% in their pursuit towards space, when this clearly was not the case for all of the wives.  Finally, one aspect of the film that stemmed away from the stereo typical gender roles was the relationship between Alan Sheppard and his wife.  When urged by his superiors to tell his wife to speak with the press/vice-president, Sheppard disregards this pressure, and supports the wishes of his wife to be sheltered from the invasion of the press/media.  Any other thoughts?  Benjamin

      After you comment on Robs and Toms blogs please consider writing or discussing the following ideas - or come up with your own.  Write an informative and entertaining review of the movie.  Read a few current movie reviews before you write your review on The Right Stuff.   At the end of the movie when Gordo Cooper is asked, “Who was the best pilot you ever saw?”  Why couldn’t he talk about Yeager?  He tried and it was on the tip of his tongue, but it never came out.  Why?     What was the theme of this film? What were the film makers trying to tell us?  Were they successful?     How does the film depict gender issues?  How does it support what you know about the fifties and the early sixties?  Were you suprised by anything in the movie?

      Hello? (HELLO, Hello, hello) Echo! (ECHO, Echo, echo)  I don't think there's anybody in here, Tom.  But just in case... if you're in 6th period, or the other AP period, I hope you remember the Holocaust/Hiroshima discussions we had.  I came across a story in the New York Times about a village in Italy attempting to prosecute some former Nazi SS members.  If this piques your interest, you can read the story here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  The question it asks is, is the world ready to forgive the Nazis?  Because Sant'Anna Italy isn't ready to forget it.  Post your thoughts about this, the draft, or your mother's snickerdoodle recipe, but say SOMETHING!  Love, Rob

      Ok, with the approval of Ms.Clark, I would like to ask everyone your opinions on the impending possibility of a draft.   Here is a  urlLink great article that introduces a glimpse of the growing probability of a draft    I didn't know that our country has 1.44 MILLION TROOPS stationed in 141 countries. Why would we want to police the whole world?  And given the result of the past few days, the miserable situations our armed forces got into in Iraq, the situation seems somewhat scary. And I know it's inevitable, but Rumsfeld's decision to keep the soldiers there for 90-120 days more is an act that would further degrade the morale of the army, after already almost all of the frontline soldiers have been put on suicide watch.   And here is an article from CNN that accounts for the Bi-Partisan support in congress for the draft   CHARLES RANGEL   Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet   Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home.   To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the "citizen soldier" ideal that has served our nation so well.  As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices.   CHARLES MOSKOS   Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee   Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls.   We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories   JAMES INHOFE   Republican Senator from Oklahoma   I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country.   I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.

       Lol yeah fear of communism is a very prevalent and integral part of American society, even to this day. Of course it's way too shallow and outright wrong to label people or groups of people in some strict, broad, undefined, and misleading category. Here is what I found to be a brief definition of "Third World Countries":  The term "Third World" was coined in 1952, in the wake of the Second World War, to refer to the ex-colonies that were not part of the two newly emerged geopolitical blocs (Soviets and US) of associated interests. The "Third" then meant the third way . So by that definition, I guess other than the US and USSR, Western european former imperialist nations and Japan won't be considered third world (because they weren't colonies), but almost every other nation could be considered third world. And interestingly enough, the US did not refer to the Soviet bloc and other communist nations as first world either, they sometimes are even categorized as second world.

      So this is the first time that I have posted, but I have seen some of the comments that have been posted and I just hope that we will be able to focus on reviewing for the AP test and not just for the time period that we are studying at the moment. But... actually, I do have a question for chapter 27. Does anyone know why Third World countries are called ''Third World"? I was just curious, so hopefully someone can help.

      Hey APUSH students!  I hope you are studying.  Let's shoot for an extra-credit movie night next Tuesday @6:00...THE RIGHT STUFF...definately one of my favorite movies and books.  Anything by Tom Wolf is great - I am currently rereading some of Halberstom's work on the fifties - he was the historian who did the great Mike Hammer impersonation today.  He is tons of fun to read...he writes pages on Elvis, I Love Lucy and the McDonald's Hamburger chain. I love pop-culture.  As someone asked during class today, Chris Mitchem - why were Americans so scared of communism?  How did this fear start - and how did the Truman and Eisenhower administration handle this fear?  Did the leaders of this time add to the fear and hysteria or attempt to control it? Howard Zinn believes the administrations created this fear to stimulate our economy?  I am not sure I buy his idea...What do you think? Where does Pop-Culture fit into this...Captain America, Mike Hammer - Hollywood was infatuated with the Western at this time? Was Elvis a communist?  James Dean?  Marlon Brando? Lucille Ball had RED hair and married a Cuban????   Blog On... I think this time period could be easily related the roaring twenties...and today - what will this decade be called?

       Tuesdays are Thursdays are good. Just on days when there is NHS (which is only twice), some people may come a few minutes late. But as for now, studying for AP is my top priority, so I will probably suck time out for the history study sessions if I have to. So it's an excellent idea.

      Hey AP Students...I hope you had a good break and are ready to get back to WORK!  The next three weeks will move quickly  - and be somewhat intense.  Jessica your notebooks will be checked on Friday...along with a quiz.  We will be having a quiz every friday...five IDs from your reading.  I need to keep you honest - we have a few weeks until the AP test. The good news - you can choose to do your notebook or not...I will not be taking the time to grade it after this friday.   It would help if you have read and thought about the origin of the Cold War and its impact on America's society for class the next two days.  I also need the song - "We Didn't Start the Fire" Billy Joel - for class.  Does anyone or there parents have the Best of Billy Joel?  I may have it at school but I couldn't bring myself to enter the building this week.  I want to have afterschool sessions on Tuesday and Thursday - they may be time to view and discuss the Centuries, Multiple Choice or review certain eras.  How do Tuesdays and Thursdays work for you guys?   See you Monday... Eye of the Tiger...:)  Clark

      Sorry everyone for using this blog for private purposes......but Ms.Clark, I have some emergency requests that just came out today!!!!!!!!!!! It's really urgent in that I was ridiculous chosen today in the Northwest Science Expo to take apart in the annual ISEF (Intel Science and Engineering Fair) (Representing get this: TEAM OREGON!)............And that happens during the second week of May!!!!!! I have to stay in portland the WHOLE WEEK and that week also freakishly coincides with AP Tests!!!!!!!!! So I have AP Chemistry test on Tuesday that I DEFINITELY CANNOT take in the Jim Parsley Center..........I have to either take the AP test DURING ISEF.....Which would require you to mail in the AP registration forms (By bloody this Tuesday), or I have to take it on a makeup day at JPC.......But in any case, the signup for me to take the test on May 10th AP Chem test at JPC is completely void now.  I'm SOOOOOOOOOOO GRAVELY SORRY about this really short notice of this ridiculous inconvenience.  Hopefully you can take notice of this blog post as soon as possible.  Thomas Chen

      Thanks to y'all for including me in your discussion group. Has anyone seen Hiroshima Mon Amour? It's an old film by Alain Resnais that begins with footage from the Hiroshima devastation and ties it to a woman's past experiences in WWII. It's been a while since I've seen it, but it might be a good view as it reveals the impact (pun intended) of the war on both Europeans and the Japanese. It is beautiful in its portrayal of the devastation of war. It's very 'art' and I think subtitled. Massive wonk points.  It has taken me many years to begin to see past the mechanics of history and foreign policy down to impact that this history has on people. In junior and high school, I was an avid student of WWII. I read books like PT-109, Guadalcanal Diary, et. al. made models of WWII airplanes. I even had an amazingly complex board game in which you could replicate almost any battle in the war. It was all VERY geeky in retrospect. I'm sure part of this fascination was due to my mother's experiences in the war as a Finnish refugee and the fact that she and I would watch the BBC documentary World at War. But as a child, the war was fascinating because of the things, places, and 'stuff of war.'   Thomas' comment about the complexity of the issue of dropping the bomb is telling. Up until 9/11, non-combatant Americans never had to deal with the war on their own soil. The WWII experiences among an average European, American, or Hiroshima resident could not be more different. As a child refugee during WWII, my mother often had no food. Some Finns ate the bark off birch trees for nourishment. Her father was killed within the first few weeks of the conflict. As the oldest child, she became an erstatz father at age 12. Sugar was the least of her worries.  I never really appreciated this very real history when I was young. History and war were either subjects of grudging study or something that I read in a book. After travelling, college study, and some sporadic personal growth, I look at history very differently now. I'm not saying that's better or worse, but my reading of history is now reflected through a desire to see it both from 'the big picture' and from the viewpoint of the human beings that are part of it. It makes history far more complex, messy, and ambiguous.  As an example, my mom was 'the enemy' in WWII. When the Finns sided with the Germans in '42 to attempt to regain the land that had been taken when Russia (our ally) invaded Finland, they became part of the Axis Powers. The Finns lost twice in WWII. Because of the Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact, they lost their land to the Russians and were forced to pay reparations to the US and other allies for siding with the Nazis. (My mom was very proud that the Finns were the only Axis nation to pay every cent of their 'debt' to the U.S. despite not receiving any of the aid given to Japan or Germany.) Despite the fact that my mother's heritage and former home is more Russian than Finnish, she strongly distrusted and disliked Russians until she developed Alzheimers. Now she loves everyone.

      Hello to all of my homies out in bloggerland.  I don't know if we realize how much time Thomas spends on this blog to make it run smoothly for us.  Next time anyone sees that wonderful little wizard, give him a hug and a kiss for being so damn tight.  Slow week in news, but I went and saw Day After Tomorrow and got thinking about global warming.  The danger is very real- studies have shown that seasonal allergy symptoms get worse every year thanks to global warming.  Steps have been taken to reduce its escalation (at least industrially), most notably through the Kyoto plan or protocol or whatever it's called.  Unfortunately for human kind, many countries that donate significant portion of greenhouse industrial excrement can't afford to change their industrial standards to reduce the CFC's and such that fill the atmosphere.  (Watch me spin this politically) I commend George Dubya for  expelling a hideous dictator out of the goodness of his heart despite the sacrifices of many Americans for purely humanitarian reasons without any nice byproducts that the American economy is STILL waiting for the benefits of... but I regret that the U.S. in all its glory can't aid an ally like, say, Russia modernize its industry which would not only benefit said nation, but the whole world.  Everyone elses thoughts on saving the environment and therefore the world?  Love Rob

      I'm not so sure that people understand what it is to be morally against something. It's not like we have a bible in our hands, knocking on people's doors and preaching to them about their horrible sins. We're not Puritans! That seems to be the stereotype that some may see whenever someone else uses morals as their base of their opinion. Whether it comes to Gay marraige, or abortion, y'all probably know where I stand on those issues... or do you? You see, I don't mind abortion being legal, but I wouldn't use it. Even if I do have an "accident" and get pregnant, however that may work. And it's not like I'm rich and have a lot of money, so I'm priveledged enough that I can say that I can handle having a child. I would be dead broke, dropping out of school, getting a job, compromising with my parents, handling their disappointment... and so on with the negatives of teen pregnancy. AND STILL, I would have the child and either keep it, or give it up for adoption... making sure FOR MYSELF that it goes to two wonderful parents who can give the child opportunities that I wouldn't be able to provide. But you know, all that would go away if only I aborted the child. But (again, using my morals OMG) I wouldn't, I couldn't, I value the life that I created too much. But this is all a hypothetical situation guys, don't worry I'm not pregnant. And I won't get pregnant til I marry, because I have that much control over that situation. But go ahead and keep abortion, because others feel that it's needed. Now was I using a bible to defend my reasons? A lot of people who think to the right don't.  When it comes to the Gay Marraige issue, I'm not homophoebic and I'm not going to shove a bible people's faces, but I don't recognize marraige of homosexuals as the same union as I would a marraige between heterosexuals. It's not the same, and it's not for reasons of what people do in the bedroom. It's much more than that, especially when there are children involved. And Rob, to give you a reason as to why I think it's wrong... it's because I believe that homosexual marraige isn't something that God designed. The design was for a man and a woman to have the marraige of holy matrimony. But to a secularist, I guess that doesn't matter. They don't use morals as the base of their opinion. They have to use facts, reasons and "imperical data" to share their beliefs, and in turn, they're viewed as the "smarter" people. Don't lie. I know the reasons why students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way. It's because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point. And teachers love it... at least most professors at universities do. I've been told that if I need a good grade in a course, I need to write a paper that agrees to the viewpoints of the professor. And they're all pretty much liberal. And don't tell me it's not true, because I've seen it. I would talk on and on and on, but like Rush Limbaugh, I'm running out of time. Yep, I listen to Rush and pretty proud of it. But I do want to say one more thing. It makes me feel bad that some people say I'm intolerant of their views when in reality they are intolerant of my views. I don't hate homosexuals, I just don't agree with them. I don't hate those who choose abortion, I just don't agree with using it. What I'm trying to say is that I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people. DOn't believe that stereotype.

      Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP US History website for the better. There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our APUSH friend's blogging profiles. And I've added three things:  1: tagboard(which is for visitors to post; or you can post short comments and quick questions and answers on some small particular topics - there is a limit to how many words one can post on the tagboard at once), 2: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 3: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post.   THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS!  Thomas

      ok... i just got back from watching a most excellent movie... The Day After... no, not that new one in the theaters (the day after tomorrow)... the one made in the 80s about nuclear war... some of you probably dont know what i'm talking about... but some (hopefully Ms. Clark) will know... I thought it was a good movie.. and brought up one of my favorite quotes from Einstein: "I don't know how world war 3 will be fought, but i can tell you how world war 4 will be fought; with sticks and stones..." very grim indeed, but a very good movie...

      Ok, i realize i havent been active in any of the blogging going on this week, but i have finally caught myself up and want to respond to some of the ideas you all have presented. I know Ms. Clark is trying to get us to talk about a new issue, but bare with me.   I understand all sides of the different arguments that have been presented, so i commend all of you for putting your ideas out there. I think the arguments that are clearly stuck in my head are Rob's (with the hope of rallying up support for the blond hair blue eyed heterosexual caucasian white males), Natalya's (arguing on both GM and EC) and Megan's. Maybe its because i agree with a lot of what they have said. Unlike Megan, i dont know many homosexuals, however my heart does go out to them. But I do realize that i dont have the same religious background as others that could hinder my sympathy for them. I still am pushing that there is a definite separation between church and state. This should be remembered when arguing whether or not GM should be legalized.   I know i posted a week ago, and it's so far back in the past that im sure it has been forgotten, but i said a lot of what Natalya said, just not as eloquently (she is of course an experienced debater!). I agree completely with her arguments, particularly on the debate over abortion and EC. I know people have moral reasons for not agreeing with its usage, however mistakes happen. It isnt fair to put an innocent child in an unforgiving world. No matter what opportunities are trying to be given to make up for lower-income, hard lives, the pain inside cannot be erased. They are brought into the world unwanted, permanently branded. And i agree, it is up to each individual to make their own decision. Being a fairly independent female, it scares me to death to know that the option may not always be open to me. Accidents happen. I know that i wouldnt want one bad decision to effect me, my unborn child, my family, and the father of the child (considering rape isnt involved). Each decision has repercussions, effecting not only one individual, but all those who surround him/her.   I'll admit it now: I am pro-choice on pretty much every aspect of social controversy. I dont think it is acceptable for a group of individuals, no matter what their backgrounds or personal beliefs may be, to make decisions that effect the masses. There are always instances where people should just have the right to make their own decisions, b/c in the long run, each individual knows what is best for himself/herself.   Addressing the idea of whether or not abortion or gay marriage should be reason to sway one's vote, i think its up to the individual.Unfortunately, i will not be 18 for the coming election and thus i cant say that i can answer the question without a little cynicism, knowing that it doesnt effect me for another 4 years. But i do think that it is worth researching and looking into. I think it's important to research all of the different positions each candidate is taking, economically, their domestic policies, and foreign policies. I dont think it would be wise to make the decision solely on one aspect of their campaigns. Basically, it's choosing the lesser evil. I dont think anyone will ever completely agree with all the prospective policies, but its choosing which one you have lesser opposition to.  Well, i hope i have covered all all the topics that have been discussed over the past week. But bare with me if i havent, a lot of ground was covered between now and the last time i posted!

      I want to make sure everyone understands that Rob is using sarcasm and exaggeration to make a point.  Please read in between the lines when you read Thomas and Rob's Blogs...boys be careful in your writing so you are not misunderstood.  (Yes I am a worry wart, a control freak and high maintenance.   I am curious what you think about Fog or War...I know I hindered second periods viewing... I am fascinated with Robert McNamara...he is brilliant and has learned and willing to share some of his misfortune.  Do you think he is fair to LeMond (spelling)?  or Johnson...neither man is able to defend himself? What point has had the most impact...the proportionality argument was very powerful.

      Haha Rob, I'm not sure if I understood your last post correctly, but it seems like it was full of metaphors and analogies. First of all, GAAAAA the oxymoron combinations of Leftist/Fascist/SuicideBomber/Know-Nothing political jargons mixed with some of your peculiarly molded mind has transplanted the great picasso like abstarct ideas into our fantastic debate blog. Emerson would laugh so hard.  Secondly, I think you were the first person to mention that gay people are more loving than heterosexuals. "Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher. Marriage is something that this group has to fight for". Although I don't deny that statement at all.  Third of all, for affirmative actions, I think Asians (especially oriental Asians) are as bad, or even worse than caucasians in lot of cases. Go figure. I actually wish I was white. Heh being a minority without the minority benefits and without the majority race ADVANTAGES is like a bogus race to me. WOH NEXT NINE HOURS KNOW-NOTHING SUPPORTERS PLEASE JOIN ROB MUILENBURGE! PROTECT THE INFALLIABLE RACE OF BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED CAUCAUSIAN MALES! Oh yeah, you HAVE to be STRAIGHT. NO GAYS ALLOWED!   INFALLIABLE RACE OF BLUE EYED BLOND HAIRED CAUCAUSIAN MALES DOMINATE THE EARTH, I know my friends. Although I'm ok with that. it's life. It's the majority race that wins everything.

      Thomas, let me extend a welcoming hand for you to shake in joining my militia of pro-homosexual terrorists.  Clearly we're becoming more militant by the second, and sooner than later we'll be suicide bombing the Fox News Channel.  Just kidding everyone, but I should make it known that ASB President is just the first step on the staircase of Ultra-Leftist Facism. I dare anyone to try and figure that out.  Anyway, I'd like to make it known that I was joking when I told Kolk she was flat out wrong.  That was me making a joke as well as pleasing my ever-expanding ego (I no longer recognize other opinions).  JKo knows I'm just playin, so all's gravy in my eyes.  I decided that I'll take a few hours off of GM rants and focus my attention on another group of individuals that is having a harder and harder time defending itself:  Heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian males.  In Thomas' post he mentioned the fact that gays are probably more loving w/ a probable smaller divorce rate.  It's that kind of heterosexual discrimination that I'm getting sick of.  Ask Chris Mitchem how hard it is to get a milkshake at McDonalds without being sneered at by the caucasian females working behind the counter- not knowing what vile bodily fluids have been hawked into his order.  Heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian males unite!  We want our close parking spots back from the handicapped.  Our innercities back from the various ethnicities.  Gynecology back from those oppressive stick-together females.  Thomas Chen will never know the difficulties of non-affirmative action.  Ask Ben Perry how hard it is to get a scholarship for being a non-minority!  For the next 9 hours I'd like to reinstate the Know-Nothing party.  Who's with me!?  After that nine hours expires it's very likely I'll go back to the minority supporting spam that got me attention in the first place, but until then, all you non-heterosexual able-bodied blond hair blue eyed caucasian male bigots better look out.  Power to the people!  Love Rob

      Wow Rob you were exactly right. Yesterday was a lull before today's storm. I have to say that although I take hardsides and are extreme sometimes, I think that it's disrepctful to call other people flatly wrong. Political issues will never have a complete 100% right or wrongs. Yeah so there!  On to the gay marriage debate, I will have to side with hardline pro-gay coalitions forces. Rob's article lets you have a glimpse of the emotional traumas and unexplicable sorrows and guilts gay people already have in their minds that they cannot communicate. Much of it of course caused by the phobias from society. Most gays have gone through (or are going through) constant fear of discriminations from the society already. These frivolous fear of gays (WITHOUT ANY SINGLE SCIENTIFIC BASIS!) are simply baseless and are simply stemming from the conformist stereotypical mainstream society's view. Denying the gays the right to marry (for they probably have more love and less like to divorce anyways) simply manifests itself from subtle stereotypical view towards gays, even if you don't want to admit it.  Discriminating against gays is completely analogus to any other form of discrimination of any RACE, or even GENDER. Just because they physically look different, act different, think differently DOES NOT make them inferior. ONLY a criminal would do so.  This great nation generously help the disabled, and the mentally retarded. We have special access, special privileges, and special facillities for these people so they can have the same opportunities as everybody else. And besides that gays are as intelligent and as abled in every intellectual as straights. Any supposedly "disabled" abilities of gays are purely the result of social pressure and phobias. If we do do our best helping disabled , why not help gay people achieve equality too? And of course everyone knows that disabled and mentally retarded people are that way because of nature(They didn't become disabled because it's cool to!) and there should be no denial into the genetic factors behind gays, AND so WHY favor some biogenetic factor over others??  How can we truly live up our meaning of freedom and equality for all if we turn a blind eye on a GROUP of citizens? I apologize if this post offended anyone.

      I don't know why we can't change peoples' feelings or beliefs.  I think we have to.  I believe it was MLK that said "we can't stop people from hating us, but we can make laws that makes it illegal to lynch us."  The change has to start somewhere, and protecting homosexual rights in the courts is the first step towards their universal acceptance.  (Ferg is gonna hate me for this but) Take the Civil War for example.  The 13th ammendment freed the slaves, the 14th protected them in the courts, the 15th let them vote.   Although gays haven't been forced into labor and don't need emancipation, the next step is to protect their rights.  Last year there were 2051 reported hate crimes based on sexual preference, up 8% from the number in 2002.  Along with protecting gay civil rights, the advancement of homosexuals will hopefully reduce the very negative anti-gay sentiment (whether conscious or not) in this country.  Kolk, you give me a good reason why gays don't have the right to marry and I'll either tell you why you're wrong, or apologize profusely.  Everyone is "different."  Why limit marriage requirements to what is done in the bedroom?  Without getting naughty, there are plenty of crazy ass things done in the bedroom besides same sex interaction.  Plain and simple, civil unions divide the society over reasons the majority of the posters find unworthy of debate.  I also want comments on the article by Andrew Sullivan- a homosexual republican.  Go Figure  Love Rob

      Though I haven't had the same experiences, I totally agree with Megan. I don't understand how being gay is morally wrong. I think that debating GM can be very pointless. The main issues lie in a person's beliefs, and debating the issue will not change how someone feels. The only debate is whether our great nation will allow everyone the same equal rights. I think it's amazing that our nation still hasn't resolved this issue, because to me it doesn't seem very complicated. Either we allow everyone to marry, and marry whomever they choose, or we deny part of our nation these equal rights. Marriage is between two people, who gave the rest of the country the right to tell them they cannot get married?  Steph B.

      Being gay is not morally wrong. I don't understand how people can say this. It doesn't make any sense to me. I never realized how many people have "problems" with gay people until I moved to Washington. It really makes me angry and I just fill with sadness. I've been around gay people my whole entire life. There is nothing anyone can tell me that would make be believe that being gay is wrong. It's so hard for me to debate this issue, because I believe that it should not even be an issue. The fact that people I care about can not legally marry the person they love infuriates me.  Does God think it's "right" to be gay? Is God ashamed at my talented intelligent cousin for being gay? Has she been a sinner her whole life just for being gay? Should she be looked down upon for being gay? Well she is. And she is terrified at what the reaction of other people will be if they find out that she is gay. Responding to Clark's questions about the effect of personal rights and civil liberties on presidential elections I think that is has great relevance. Bush is against gay marriage. This is what swayed my vote. If I was born 12 days earlier I would not vote for Bush. This may seem like a stupid reason to decide how to vote, but it's reason enough for me. This is how I feel. I can not rationally debate this topic because hearing the opposing side just breaks my heart.

      Kolk, you're wrong.  I don't see how you feel GM changes HM in any way.  Props to your EC stance, but MARRIAGE is as important to gays as it is to straights at least according to this article.  Check it out.  Why The M Word Matters To Me  Only marriage can bring a gay person home  By ANDREW SULLIVAN  Feb. 16, 2004  As a child, I had no idea what homosexuality was. I grew up in a traditional home — Catholic, conservative, middle class. Life was relatively simple: education, work, family. I was raised to aim high in life, even though my parents hadn't gone to college. But one thing was instilled in me. What mattered was not how far you went in life, how much money you earned, how big a name you made for yourself. What really mattered was family and the love you had for one another. The most important day of your life was not graduation from college or your first day at work or a raise or even your first house. The most important day of your life was when you got married. It was on that day that all your friends and all your family got together to celebrate the most important thing in life: your happiness — your ability to make a new home, to form a new but connected family, to find love that put everything else into perspective.   But as I grew older, I found that this was somehow not available to me. I didn't feel the things for girls that my peers did. All the emotions and social rituals and bonding of teenage heterosexual life eluded me. I didn't know why. No one explained it. My emotional bonds to other boys were one-sided; each time I felt myself falling in love, they sensed it, pushed it away. I didn't and couldn't blame them. I got along fine with my buds in a nonemotional context, but something was awry, something not right. I came to know almost instinctively that I would never be a part of my family the way my siblings might one day be. The love I had inside me was unmentionable, anathema. I remember writing in my teenage journal one day, "I'm a professional human being. But what do I do in my private life?"   I never discussed my real life. I couldn't date girls and so immersed myself in schoolwork, the debate team, school plays, anything to give me an excuse not to confront reality. When I looked toward the years ahead, I couldn't see a future. There was just a void. Was I going to be alone my whole life? Would I ever have a most important day in my life? It seemed impossible, a negation, an undoing. To be a full part of my family, I had to somehow not be me. So, like many other gay teens, I withdrew, became neurotic, depressed, at times close to suicidal. I shut myself in my room with my books night after night while my peers developed the skills needed to form real relationships and loves. In wounded pride, I even voiced a rejection of family and marriage. It was the only way I could explain my isolation.  It took years for me to realize that I was gay, years more to tell others and more time yet to form any kind of stable emotional bond with another man. Because my sexuality had emerged in solitude — and without any link to the idea of an actual relationship — it was hard later to reconnect sex to love and self-esteem. It still is. But I persevered, each relationship slowly growing longer than the last, learning in my 20s and 30s what my straight friends had found out in their teens. But even then my parents and friends never asked the question they would have asked automatically if I were straight: So, when are you going to get married? When will we be able to celebrate it and affirm it and support it? In fact, no one — no one — has yet asked me that question.  When people talk about gay marriage, they miss the point. This isn't about gay marriage. It's about marriage. It's about family. It's about love. It isn't about religion. It's about civil marriage licenses. Churches can and should have the right to say no to marriage for gays in their congregations, just as Catholics say no to divorce, but divorce is still a civil option. These family values are not options for a happy and stable life. They are necessities. Putting gay relationships in some other category — civil unions, domestic partnerships, whatever — may alleviate real human needs, but by their very euphemism, by their very separateness, they actually build a wall between gay people and their families. They put back the barrier many of us have spent a lifetime trying to erase.   It's too late for me to undo my past. But I want above everything else to remember a young kid out there who may even be reading this now. I want to let him know that he doesn't have to choose between himself and his family anymore. I want him to know that his love has dignity, that he does indeed have a future as a full and equal part of the human race. Only marriage will do that. Only marriage can bring him home.

      Hey all of you happy bloggers. Paul, it is a good thing I will not be old enough to vote in this election because I don't like either candidate.  Anyway I am really posting to discuss the Da Vinci Code, a book of which I just finished reading. With all of the hype concerning this book and input from others who have read, I was excpecting a great book that would address controversial issues of religious history. The book failed to meet the standards I had set, and completely let me down. It actually turned out to be the most annoying book I have ever read. First of all the author, Dan Brown, used all kinds of foreshadowing trying to keep you stuck on the book. He would hint on subjects or different happening that wouldn't actually take place until 4 chapters after comment. So as I read I would try to concentrate on the matters before me but I constantly had the thought of his foreshadowing in my mind. So I could not put the book down, and usually people use that phrase to descirbe a book that really interests them but in this case I just needed to find out the stupid answers to the stupid questions. By the time I found the answer or I reach the happenstance that had been revealed tens of pages beforehand, I would now have experienced more of the same types of comments and the vicious cycle would restart. I know that this kind of writing is common but I think the author really overused its use and it started to get on my nerves. I guess that means Dan Brown is a good writer because however conniving his tactics, I could not put the book down.      Another problem I had with this is finding the difference between fact and fiction. There were some very interesting ideas posed but I would like to see justification for some of the statements made because the only way they would be cool is if they were true. Anyway despite my conflict the Da Vinci Code, I am reading the prequel Angels and Demons, I guess I am still trying to fulfill my initial hopes for greatness from the first. If any of you have read the book I am curious as to your thoughts on it.  Rob you are my sunshine Chris

      I heard Gore's speech yesterday, very, um, how should we say eloquent.  He's about as motivating as a tree stump.  A dead tree stump.  Seriously, I love Howard Dean, the dems should have run him.  "And then we're going back to Washington DC to take back the white house- YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!".  Howard Dean is great.  Kerry is lucky to have him drumming up support for his campaign.  In other news Kerry backed out of his plan to not accept the nomination(which would not allow him to raise anymore money).  He had the gaul to blame Bush, "Because Bush didn't limit his take to 19 million and take matching funds, it forced Kerry to consider not taking the nomination" to paraphrase.  What an ass.

      So, I looked up Robert McNamara - very controversial.  I'm excited to watch the movie.  I think it's always interesting when people who actually shaped the past are able to look back with perfect hindsight and evaluate what they did - right and wrong.  He said in an interview, "This century [the 20th] will go down as the bloodiest...we'll have lost 160 million people killed in conflict."  That's too many, I hope THIS century will be a lot more peaceful.  Speaking of which, how about the new warning from Ashcroft?? And... Gore's speech today, OH MY!  Anyway, have a good night!

      Hey Bloggers...Who says the abortion topic is dead.  You seem to have plenty to say about it...and your knowledge about contraceptives is very admirable.  I also appreciate how you relate it to the constitution and personal rights.  So many major issues in American history are related to personal rights and civil liberties.   Do you think this issue has enough relevance to sway how you would vote for president?  Should it?  College portfolios...I think the college admissions process would be an interesting topic to debate...especially after out discussion in 2nd period today.  I think the movie Fog of War will lead to some interesting discussion.  For some of you it may help if you look into the life of Robert McNamara before watching the movie.    I love the post AP period...it actually gives us time to get to know each other.  Have a good evening and see you tomorrow.

      Based on my own beliefs I'm against abortion.  I feel that both the morning after pill and first term abortion are wrong for me.  Adoption can be much better in the long run for the baby and the mother.  Many women who have had abortions say they wish they hadn't.  Abortion is not something you can take back.  Before women choose to have an abortion they should realize and understand its effects on their body.  However, this is America, one of the few places on Earth were people can live freely.  Therefore to deny a person the right to choose what to do with her own body goes against what we as Americans stand for. One issue that really itches me is what role should fathers play in abortion?  In reality it took an man and a woman to make the baby, but the baby only grows inside the woman.  Is abortion a woman's struggle?  Just curious.

      I agree with Natalya.  I don't think that a group of people (aka the government) can impose their beliefs on another group of people.  On the issue of GM, it is ridiculous to say that two people who love each other and are willing to make that kind of commitment to each other can't because said people are both of the same gender.  Also, I think that the "slippery slope" argument is stupid.  Just because I see two women getting married on TV, I'm not going to go out demanding all kinds of other pointless things like the right to marry my cat.  And as for abortion: while the idea of killing babies (or fetuses that could potentially be wonderful people someday) really bothers me, I don't think that I have the right to tell my friend that they can't have an abortion.  It was interesting because I went into class set on the opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, and left class with the opinion I just stated.  Finally, the fat kids.  I really don't know what to think.  On one hand, I think that taxing junk food is a little extreme.  But on the other hand, children are ridiculously occupied with Doritos and Halo, and do absolutely NOTHING.  But how could the government take a role?  They obviously attempt to control what is being served in schools and make it nutritious, it just as obviously doesn't work (look at Skyview's menu).  P.E. classes are ineffective.  And the government, while they can run things like schools, shouldn't be allowed to dictate what people eat at home.  I guess the best solution is the one Tyson mentioned, where the government looks at what corporations are putting in their foods and look for healthier alternatives.   OK, I'm done now. If there is a flaw in any of my arguments, I'm sure someone will let me know. Bye.

      I think it's important to be realistic in this debate, if not simply because idealism will fail to present any real answers.  Pragmatism is key, and I think everyone needs to keep in mind that while America is a land which prides on being the land of opportunity for millions it is not.  America's middle class has been shrinking, and will continue to shrink while the lower class grows and upward mobility stalls.  With the education system in general disarray especially in impoverished areas, I think it's rather unrealistic to expect a majority of foster children or impoverished children to grow up to cure cancer or become doctors lawyers and indian chiefs(due note the culture reference there).  Not that I approve of abortion but we have failed to help the lower classes in the country, the reasons we have are up for debate(and would make for a good one), but I think not exasperating the problem is good policy.  Gay's should marry, marriage is secular in that it's awarded by counties irregardless of religion and brings with it financial benefits tax-wise.  Since these are both government imposed and our government is secular and thus should take no cues from religious authorities, I think gays should be allowed to marry.  If the word marry bothers people too much, I wouldn't be too opposed to changing the official term to civil unions for everyone and making marriage a religious only institution.  Maybe we could get 'civil unionized' at the justice of the peace, but married at a church, and the churches could decide to not let gays 'marry' perse but they could still reap the financial benefits and official representation from a 'civil unionization'.  Or we could just get it overwith and let the gay people marry.  It's going to happen eventually, why put up such a fight?

      I personally think its wrong, better yet "morally wrong" to impose your morals on any other person or a group of people, that is concerning gay marriages and abortion. I mean if religious people believe that abortion is wrong no one forces them to have it, but they can't hinder other people in their choice to have abortion. There is lot of idealistic talk around here, especially saying that the problem would be solved if people simply stopped having sex, but the fact is human instincts often take over reason and a lot of people don't even see anything wrong with having sex. The question then is how we can help those people that do have "accidents" and are irresponsible. I heard a lot of people say that instead of being aborted the child should be given to foster care, which I think is even greater irresponsibility. It's irresponsible to throw away your child once you gave life to her/him, abortion in a way is taking responsibility of your actions; once that child is in the foster care you will never know what kind of a life that child will have, whether he/she will be abused, sexually harassed or simply have an unhappy life knowing that he/she was an unwanted child, thrown into the world as a homeless dog. Many say that there are a lot of couples that simply dream adopting cute little babies and providing them with a wonderful life, but there are lot of kids in foster care around the world and all of them in no way possible will have enough couples to be adopted by. Anyway, I think the pill is one of the most important innovations in history of womankind, it eliminates that dead end of either having abortion or giving birth and then giving up that precious life to the "cruel and perilous world."   Concerning gay marriages, Rob has voiced my opinion in the best way possible. Afterall this is America...  my country tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing. So shouldn't we all have the right to love and to live our lives happily as we wish to as long as we don't harm anyone else. I mean do you become physically or mentally harmed if you see a married homosexual couple? What goes on in their bedroom is of no ones business but theirs, and I think who should be of more concern are the preachers who vigorously preach about homosexuality as a sin and a "morally wrong doing" and then go an have "fun" with their own little "buddies" seven years old, sick.

      I think everyone in this blog is missing the point of emergency contraception.  It does NOT cause an abortion.  Because that fact seems to get so easily confused, let me explain how pregnancy and conception work.  After intercourse that ends in ejaculation, sperm cells may live in the very hospitable environment of the vagina for about 5 days.  If there are sperm still living in the vagina during the time of ovulation it is very probable that a pregnancy will occur.  What the morning after pill does is prevent the egg from being released therefore preventing pregnancy or prevent a fertilized egg from implantation in the uterus where it would THEN begin to mature.  This IS NOT an abortion!  With that logic, everyone that takes the birth control is instigating one indefinately long abortion, which they clearly are not doing.  Furthermore, the point of emergency contraception is not to be a primary source of birth control in the first place.  A fully functioning condom used properly is more effective than EC, but sometimes the condom comes off, breaks, or "little spermies get out" for whatever reason, opening the door to an unwanted pregnancy by responsible sex-havers.  Another scenario is a rape/date-rape situation where sex was not planned.  It is unfair to the rape victim as well as the bastard child that results from the unwanted pregnancy.  Lastly, I know there will be a situation in which one of these bloggers will get caught up in the passionate moment and omit protection.  I'm not excusing irresponsibility, but why risk the pregnancy if there is a safe, non-abusable form of contraception that could eliminate the unwanted consequence?  It's fine to criticize EC's use from a seperated vantage, but wait until you or your partner is panicking because the condom broke, and try to tell me you wouldn't want an easily available solution that ultimately PREVENTS abortion if that is the last resort for an unwanted pregnancy.  I honostly don't see where a debate against this medication stems from other than ignorance, but consider yourselves educated now.  The only safe sex is abstinence...  Love, Rob

      I have to disagree with Chris on the morning after pill and abortion. They both terminate a pregnancy. I think if people think they are responsible to have sex, then they should be responsible enough to use protection. I know condoms aren't always 100% effective and sometimes little sperm-ies get out, but if you are responsible enough to have sex, you have to be responsible enough to deal with the consequences, whatever they might be. I think some people use abortion and the morning after pill as a form of birth control after they have had sex, rather then using birth control before or during. If you aren't ready to have kids, then you aren't ready for sex. I think if people weren't so caught up on acting older then they are, we wouldn’t have to have this talk about whether abortion should be legal or not, because there wouldn’t be a high number of unwanted pregnancies.

      Wow, it is nice to see all of the debate going on and it is nice to see everyone's different views. Rob, congratulations on the longest, most well-constructed blog in the history of blogger. The current debate topic of abortion and birth-control seems to manifest a rift between morals and science. The problem now is to recognize the difference and form opinions/arguments. Chris is certainly right-on when he talks of the moral similarities between taking the morning-after pill and an abortion. However, as the morals are similar, the science and event of each are so drastically different that it separates the moral argument on a scientific level. I would say that it would be much more demoralizing for a woman, perhaps her boyfriend and parents as well, to go through a surgical abortion. If taking a pill after sex allows a girl to not have to go through with an abortion this then reduces a life-changing experience to a gulp...And a swallow. Therefore, the repercussions of each event and the moral affect that those repercussions have, separate the two.   ~Holla

      Hey all, I don't mean to light the fire for a debate but I don't have a problem with abortion, and I don't see how abortion and the morning after pill differ in purpose of use. Whats the difference between stopping something thats going to exist than ceasing something that barely does. A pregnancy is the process of producing a baby, once a mommy and a daddy have sex and the sperm meets the egg that process begins. Whether a person recognizes the possibility of a baby earlier or later, the possibility and probability of a baby are the same in both situations. If one has to use the morning after pill to stop the inevitability of a baby growing, then it is obvious that the person taking the  pill beleives that a baby has been conceived, and wishes to cancel that conception. Cancelling the conception is taking the possibility of existence away from that baby. Now how does that differ from abortion? Due to that, I don't see how people can justify their negative views on abortion while supporting the morning after pill.  When it comes down to it, both methods of ending a pregnancy are ways out for people who are not ready to become parents. And it is my personal opinion that a way out three days after conception does not differ from that of 3 weeks.   -I love you guys,  Chris Mitchem

      I'm going to kind of answer my own question about what people's opinions are of the morning after pill, because I never really did answer it myself.  For some reason, I really do not consider it to be abortion.  Because you can only take it up to three days after you've had intercourse, and you also at that point have no way of knowing if you're pregnant, so I don't consider it taking a life.  As Rob said (or maybe Ms. Clark said it, I can't remember), the morning after pill is much more of a form of birth control than an abortion tool.  Abortion is a deliberate choice to take a babies' life in it's (sometimes) later forms of developement, while the morning after pill is simply a safety net.  As for the gay marriage issue...this issue is extremely sticky to get around.  I personally, partly because of my religious background, think that being gay is morally wrong.  However, we live in America.  Here we are supposed to be able to have the freedom to do as we please, get the job we want, eat what food we want, and marry who we want.  It then becomes an issue of how far the government is going to get into Americans personal lives and try to take control.  Do they really have the right to say that you can't marry who you want to just because it's morally wrong?  Perhaps that's stepping in too far, but then I get into a conflict with my own morals of gay marriage being sinful according to the Bible.  Most of you probably don't know that in the United Methodist Church in the past few months, one of their pastors has openly admitted to being gay and having a lifetime partner.  They went to Portland and got married recently also.  Well, needless to say that opened up a HUGE problem within the church.  Not only the question of whether God thinks it's right to be gay or not, but also does the church want a gay person to be able to preach?  After a very drawn out trial (which is still being protested and debated) the Church decided that the pastor would still be allowed to preach.    Up until recently, I hadn't seriously thought about how much GM would effect and divide our country.  But just thinking about it from that one light opens up so many controveresies, and many more that are most likely to come.  It's such a vast discussion, and it can't be talked about with people's personal feelings and morals coming into play.  The madness of the world today...  Well, it is getting late and I should probably be going to bed.  I think that I've rambled on enough to bore you all to tears.  See you in school tomorrow!    ~Kimber

      I also thought the Life Skills Prom was a great experience. I thought that ASB did a great job at decorating and planning it. I think that we all made it a great night for them. I really got to see them have some fun and it just made me appreciate the little things in my life. Ha... I spent more time at that prom than I did at my own! Hope everyone had a nice weekend.

      Clark, How dare you challenge me?  The morning after pill or emergency contraception either prevents an egg from being released, or creates an unhospitable environment in the uterus to prevent implantation the same way that birth control pills, shots, and patches work.  The defenition of pregnancy is the implantation of a fertilized egg into the uterus.  I repeat, the morning after pill DOES NOT abort a pregnancy and there are plenty of on-line resources to back that up.  The pill is useful for unplanned intercourse including rape or condom breakage.  Studies show no harmful side effects, but unfortunately, the FDA decided (against surgeon general recommendation) that emergency contraception not be sold over-the-counter because of the lack of specific directions for use.  With any luck, that problem will be remedied and EC will hit the shelves hell-bent on protecting against unwanted pregnancy.  Write to your congressmen to speed up the process.  Love, Rob

      Good Morning Bloggers...I agree with Rob...the Life Skills prom was and is an awesome event.  It is the best dance of the year.  I hope more of you are able to participate next year...it gives you a new appreciation and insight on what's important in life.  All of your posts are interesting and insightful and Rob your section on GM was well thought out but I do want to challenge you on the day after pill...I THINK (I have not researched it.) you can take the pill up to three days after you have had sexual intercourse...and if your egg is fertilized it would terminate the pregnancy which would be an abortion.  There is also the pill you can take several weeks after pregnancy that many abortion clinics are offering to their patients.  I am not sure how these pills sit with Pro-Lifers.    I will see you Monday...I am going to try and rent Fog of War today and prepare something for class next week.  Clark

      Kimber, I don't know what problems anyone but the Catholic church would have with the morning after pill.  I single out the Catholics because they are the only group I know of that has discouraged the use of birth control- which is all the morning after pill is.  It has the same chemical that a birth control pill does, and the same effect, just a double the dose of a weekly or monthly pill that interferes with the release, or implantation of an egg after unprotected sex.  It DOES NOT abort a pregnancy which is a common misconception.  The real problem with the morning after pill is that it is not an over-the-counter medication.  It is not marketed as a replacement for a condom or other contraceptive, but rather a substance that can be taken in an emergency.  Plain and simple, if the morning after pill becomes more easily accessable, abortion rates decrease.  Now on to the debate we had friday on gay marriage... why arguments against gay marriage (GM) don't work (many arguments against gay marriage overlap and I'm going to refute all that I can recall, but possibly not in the most organizationally logical, but bear with me);  Civil Unions:  The fourteenth ammendment declares any law abridging rights illegal and Brown vs. Board (fifty years ago last week) declared separate unequal.  Allowing gays to marry does not detract at all from heterosexual marriages, I'll get to that later.  Religion:  Besides the obvious Church and State separation, I'd like to challenge those who claim that their only opposition to GM is because God finds it immoral.  The only verses where the Bible expressly declares homosexuality sinful is in Leviticus, however, also in Leviticus there are laws forbidding mules, clothing made of more than one material, and the consumption of shellfish.  Even the most pious of midwestern farmers use mules, the devoutest of New York Irish-Catholics wear spandex, and the most faithful of Southern Baptists eat Louisiana oysters.  So why is the law forbidding homosexuality still relevant while so many Christians across the country would be burning pigeons, rams or bulls for atonement every day?  It is unfair to God, unfair to oneself, and unfair to homosexuals to be hypocritical in ones faith.  Lastly, there is no law forcing religious institutions to accept state-issued marriage certificates.  I know that I will not convince many to disregard a good portion of the Old Testament, but none should argue that universally legalizing GM infringes upon their religious beliefs.  Legalizing GM sets dangerous precedents.  AKA, the "slippery slope" issue: This argument suggests that there is something wrong with homosexuality in the first place.  That because heterosexuals can never comprehend its biological intricacies homosexuality is therefore immoral or wrong.  Some would argue that legalizing GM encourages homosexuality- to that I ask what is wrong with that?  Never mind the intended rhetoric of that question, the real contention is that homosexuality has been around since the beginning of time and will continue to stick around long after an ammendment to ban GM.  Others would say that gays don't hold the institution of marriage is the same esteem as heteros, but I would argue that they hold it higher.  Marriage is something that this group has to fight for.  A rite of maturity and consecration that has been to this point forbidden to them.  George W. Bush has proposed an ammendment banning GM as part of his Marriage Protection platform. I would ask the president to explain why, after two years as Governor of Texas, divorce rates in his states jumped up 6% after a steady decline over the last 25 years.  Gays can create the same environment of dependence and stability that the state provides benefits for.  Those who suggest that GM promotes infidelity, insincincerity, or various other ins promotes the very KKK/neo-Nazi idea that gays are inferior, as well as the perpetuation of the hate and discrimination that results.  Lastly, there is another argument that gay marriage opens the door to marriage to animals, or polygamy.  Marriage, ideally, is the manifestation of a commitment made in love.  Historically this has not been the case in heterosexuals when arranged marriages to expand fortunes and empires have been abused by straight royalty and peasantry as long as time remembers, and although that history has faded out, I see no reason as to why the commitment of two people in love has to be expanded to animals whom the law could successfully argue do not share the human emotion ideally involved in a marriage.  As for polygamy, I see no problem with it.  I have had first-hand accounts with personal friends of polygamists in Utah.  While the state doesn't recognize their marriage, the man of the house (so to speak) commits himself to each of his wives, supports his children, and the members of the family receive the benefit of an environment much healthier than that of an abusive or neglectful albeit "normal" household.  My conclusion to the arguments against GM is that in many cases they are the manifestation of an instinctual reflex against homosexuality.  I won't deny the fact that witnessing two males kiss does not sit well with me, but that is no reason to punish those, who for whatever reason, are physically attracted to the same sex.  If anyone wants to challenge my statements or add to my list of arguments to refute, I gladly accept the confrontation.  A metric plethora of people have claimed that GM is such a frivolous issue to get so passionate about, and on the first layer, I believe they are right.  But this argument is not just about GM; it's another pinnacle of the continuing struggle minorities have for equality in this America so proud of its Land of the Free.  Think about it.  Love Rob

      Hello all you crazy blogging children!  To start, I want to say that the Life Skills prom was so much fun!  Everyone that was there, you know what I'm talking about.  That was awesome.    I do have a question for all of the 2nd period, or 6th period kids.  On the issue of abortion, what do you all think of the "Morning After" pill?  I was talking to Bethany about it today, and I was just wondering if any of you had any imput on the issue.  Oh, and here's a random piece of info, for those of you who said that no one would want to adopt African Americans, or that the majority of the poor women who get abortions are black:  The amount of black women who get abortions is half of that of white women.  Black women actually have hugely decreased the amounts of abortions, and the reason behind it is because the African American Baptist Church has gotten so involved in enforcing abstinence. So..there's something to chew on for any of you all who had expressed that black women were having the most abortions in America.  I hope that you all are having a wonderful and fun weekend, see you all in school on Monday!    Kimber

      Hey!  I thought that our debate in 2nd period went really well.  For someone in 6th period, did you guys break up into little groups, or did you all debate it in one big group?  We formed two groups, with one watching and the other debating, and it went pretty well.  But it was hard, because we all wanted to hear everyone's ideas, but with so many people and only 45 minutes, most of us only got to talk once.    The MUN kids in our class are INSANE, spouting off random facts that are somehow relevant to what we're discussing.  If only we were all that smart...but, I've gotta be honest Thomas (and don't get heated), but I think that your issue on abortion in 3rd World Countries belongs in a completely different discussion.  Maybe I just don't know enough about Bush's policy, but I don't see how that effects the subject of our discussion on Friday.    And, for those of you who think that morals shouldn't be involved in deciding whether abortion should be legalized or not, I think that's impossible.  For example, I believe that no baby should be killed, but that if the mother has no way of taking care of the baby, that adoption is the best thing for it.  But someone else will feel differently, that the fetus isn't yet a person or that the mother has the right to kill or keep her baby.  That's a difference in morals and personal beliefs.  There's no way to take a stand on an issue like this without including your own morals.  Issues like abortion and gay marriage are built completely on personal opinions and cannot be decided in any other way.  PS  I'm not anti-choice, I'm anti-death! :)  See you all on Monday.  Bethany

      WHOA WHOA WHOA......This blog is really heating up now....and that's awesome news  The debate today was impressive.....there are some talented 2nd perioders out there that really SHOULD JOIN THE DEBATE/MUN TEAM.....following Rob Muilenburge's great and courageous step.  For the abortion issue, I continue to stress the fact that whatever the case, the ultimate responsibility comes down to taking care of the child, whether it's parental care, adoptions, or fostercare. I dissagree with the fact that any living cell is somehow given the chance to become a genius and those wonderful dreams are innately possessed in the process. It's simply not true. It's simply a wild dream to think a living cell born to a perfectly dangerous and alien society would be expected to grow up healthily or EVEN SURVIVE THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY STILL HAVE NOT OPPENED THEIR EYELIDS.........hhhmmmmmm maybe that's why infant mortality rates in third world countries are as high as 50%! Or half of the babies don't make it through the first two years of their lives. Hmmmmmmm how IRRESPONSIBLE are we then....how many more babies are killed and what's the strain on the society then. And that's not already taking into account the risk of lives the mothers have to go through bearing the child and raising the child up under extreme hostile situations.  I have to agree completely with how Bush's actions of punishing foreign country clincs that give out abortions would only hurt the destitute third world societies and does nothing to educate and prevent these kind of situations from happening again. The truth is, in the majority of 3rd world countries, and as a singlet example, SE Asia's Cambodia, sexual exploitations is extremely rampant (more rampant than anything you've ever imagined that could happen). Such poor countries. People younger than us would be SOLD BY THEIR PARENTS for prostitutes because the families are simply sooooo poor. And for us it is easy to "hey you have to understand the consequence of sex" and that, but many destitute people in third world countries PEOPLE SIMPLY DON"T KNOW AND HAVE NEVER HAD THE EDUCATION FOR THAT. EDUCATION and the corresponding higher level of social-economic status is the KEY for woman to make wise decisions. Education is the key for elevating the traditional degrading and subhuman status of woman in many third world countries. Thus, instead of withdrawing aids and funds from foreign clinics where abortions are performed, it's an opportunity for us to show our egalitarian American values and try to put more aids into education programs, and more aids so more people can lift out of poverty situations.   Yeah an thus, I think that abortion should be upheld simply looking at the world with reality......And of course if you are educated and wise and know how to make the choice, GOOD FOR YOU (you are extremely lucky and should be proud of yourself of not ever having the need for abortion), but for millions of others around the country and around the world.......There is a long long long way to go to create a perfect utopian society......   As for the childhood obesity debate, we'll see on Monday.  I also want to comment on the gay marriage issue here. The compromise for both sides would be civil union protections for at least basic liberties so gay people are not constantly in a state of fear and constantly being prejudiced. And ultimately, I believe that they should enjoy the exact same liberties and opportunities any other person enjoys. Because ultimately, people CAN biologically be gay. To deny gay people the same rights all other citizens enjoy would be like degrading disabled, mentally retarded, or even a minority race of people.

      Hey, what's up?  I thought the discussions in class went pretty well.  I just had to post my thoughts on the whole same sex marriage issue.  I agree with Megan, it is a person's own beliefs but religion is part of a person's beliefs.  My thoughts are that same sex marriages are morally wrong and they shouldn't be allowed.  But on the other hand, as Ryan Elliot said today, marriage is just another benefit for these people.  Not allowing it isn't going to do anything to the gay population.  They are still going to have the same relationships and everything.  I guess that it always will turn into a heated conversation because of so many different beliefs.  Anyway, that was just a thought I had after class. Keep it real!

      I thought todays debate went really well, and like a lot of people I'm against abortion but believe in pro choice. I think the government would have a lot of problems trying to make abortion illegal again. I believe many would see it as an erosion of women's rights. Just this Sunday a huge rally was held in Washington with over 800,000 people marching for pro choice. Like Sarah said, I also think that religion should not have a place in this issue. This issue is an all American issue. An individual's moral beliefs whether it is based on religion, family, etc, is not significant to everyone. Then you can get into ethnics and if the fetus is an actual baby and things just get confusing. How I see it, the law is already standing, and making abortion illegal is an infringment on women's rights to choose. Is abortion wrong...well I think it is. But what about freedom... the foundation of American identity.   I'd like to be honest and say that I am worried if 2nd period debates about gay marriages. This issue is extremely personal and emotional for me.

      My little dumplings are growing up...I think it is so interesting to watch adolescents begin to formulate and defend their opinions on such controversial issues.  I was watching many of you in second period with the personal struggle of Abortion being morally wrong yet unwilling to take a strong stand against others...hopefully you will continue to grow and think on these issues as you further develop.  Some of you will become more conservative in your thinking as you experience the "real" world while others may become more liberal.  Trying to figure out what you believe in and what you stand for is so important in figuring out who you are...and whatever that is I respect all of your ideas and opinions to the upmost.  Commentary...the second period debate was impressive...I was very impressed by your sensitivity and the resepect towards others...will you have the same resepectful tone when we discuss child obesity?  (I have to laugh because this topic has been hot on the news and NPR lately.)  Sixth period...the Pat Tillman discussion was interesting.  I am unsure how I feel or if I feel anything to be completely honest.  However, he will be the "poster" child for this war and remembered in many history books.  He is also an excellent example of the sense of Nationalism produced by the 911 World Trade Center attack.  I appreciate all of your struggle with the value of life...and yes I think we can all agree upon that everyone's life is valuable.  I think the discussion also brings up other valuable questions?  What is the role of the Media?  And who is really in charge of what we see and hear by our news media?  Who decides? Who pays for it? AND who gets the profit?  Obviously these people (dynasties) have a lot of power and influence over our nation?  The gay marriage debate was a little heated.  I think Ben may be right that is an issure that might divide our nation.  I like how Kalie related it to the Civil Rights Act - an example of a good history student.  But should our government be involved in a personal institution.  They set age limits? Should they?  Maybe we could lower the divorce rate by increasing the age and wait time before people get married...how about 25 and you must "date" for two years?   That might make our families more stable...their are so many other issues...maybe our goverment should control who we marry to make sure it lasts longer?  Maybe people weren't meant to be married...of course I am just thinking out loud...(Playing the Devil's advocate in most cases...)  I must get ready to boogie down at the Life Skills Prom.  Have a good weekend and I look forward to hearing about more of your ideas...  Ms. Clark

      hey guys its my first time on THA BLOG (im kinda nervous...) ne ways i just wanted to follow up on our debate today in second period about abortion and if the government should have a say in it. well... i dont think they should. I know a lot of people dont believe in abortion but that is their opinion and there may be some people who think differently.  us and especially the government dont have any right to tell those people how to live their lives. Mar i got your back on this one!! im against abortion but not against human rights.  bie bie

      I wasnt able to be in class today, as Ms. Clark already knows, but i do want to participate in the "discussion". On the issue of same sex marriage, I support the legality of it. Whether or not i agree with it morally has nothing to do with my decision. My decision is based on the constitutionality: our country takes pride in the freedoms we are guranteed as American citizens, many of which we take advantage of daily. However, with the Civil Rights Act of 1960, it is unconstitutional to descriminate based on race, national origin, or SEX (which for me, includes sexual preference). How can we stand by our constitution and the freedoms it gives us if it is not used to give these freedoms equally to ALL citizens? Along with that, even since the first colonists, separation from church and state has been established. Thus, even if it is morally wrong based on your religious creed, it is not justification for its illegality. I understand both sides. I see where religious arguments can come into play and how morals effect our ways of thinking, but we must see past that...we must see is it constitutional? And does it provide equal freedom to all U.S. citizens? ANALOGY  On the issue of Pat Tillman...i think i'm a little more conservative. Yes, he did a great thing, and he SHOULD be remembered because of his bravery and giving up everything he has here at home. But I think it is insulting to all those other soldiers fighting for the same reasons, but getting no recognition just because they arent pro-football players or millionaires...they also are giving up a great deal to be fighting overseas. They're giving up their families, their children, if they're in the reserves, their jobs (even though theyre not highly public jobs)...theyre giving up just as much as he is, yet are quickly forgotten. How is this fair? What are we as Americans supposed to tell the other soldiers' families when they die in action? they werent famous? they arent as brave as Pat Tillman was? NO! I DO think it is important that we remember him. Maybe we should name the stadium after him. But i think to be fair and equal, we must also give recognition to the other men fighting overseas. The issue of Pat TIllman is like group projects. Everyone does (or SHOULD do)their own part, working hard and diligently, but then when the time comes to present, the speaker of the group gets all the recognition and everyone else's hard work is quickly dismissed. That should not be the case here. Pat Tillman, although a well-known hero, was part of a team. He did his part, along the sides of many other brave men. When the time comes, which it has, shouldn't all the men get recognized for their hard work?   Well, that's my little argument that i WOULD have discussed in the discussion had i been there. Dont fret, i WILL be at school on Monday!  Kailie

      K, well here is what I have to say about the abortion debate that we had in class today...  There are so many factors that contribute into abortion besides just the idea of "killing an unborn baby". There are the ins and outs of foster care, adoption, women's lives, children's live as well as the state that our country is in.  I am religious, though I believe that religion can have no place in this issue. It is fair that everyone can have their own morals, beliefs and religious system, but what about the whole idea of separation of church? Just because "the bible says so" doesn't mean that is what our country should go by. Do you see what I mean?   I have a lot more to say on this issue, though I know there is really no way of winning the argument. Is there really a happy-medium? Because I mean if abortions were to be allowed for only hazardous pregnancies, rape and incest cases, where and how excactly do you draw the line? If it's okay for some women, why not for all? And in the case of pregnancies that are harmful for the pregnant woman, perhaps it is "God's will" that it ends that way? I don't really believe that, I'm just throwing it out there.   Anyway, I would never have an abortion myself, but I wouldn't want to take that right away from any woman who wanted to use it. Afterall, if abortion is against yours or whomever's religion, they will  have to take it up with Him in the end. We're not God. That statement can be taken another way: we can't take away life...but if we can make it, why CAN'T we take it away? And just because someone doesn't support something or even think it is right, it doesn't mean they should force that opinion and ways of life upon other people. That's all for now.   Peace.

      My comments about the abortion portion of the debate is this... I'm not pro-abortion, but I am pro-choice. Can I be that way? I don't feel that abortion is a legitimate way of escaping the problems of unexpected pregnancy. The woman should have thought about the consequences of potential pregnancy before she decided to have sex. I know I know, but what about the women who get raped. That solution would be solved by adoption. I have heard from some people that adoption isn't a sucessful option. What I have to say to that is where's your proof? With the process of adoption, the baby, at birth, is signed over to a family or a couple. It's not like the baby is being handed over to the state. It's the state that has the problems of foster care, or the problems people may think of when they hear of adoption as a solution. But anyways, should the government keep abortion legalized? I'm against abortion, but the to tell you the truth, the government should have no say as to what women do with their bodies. Abortion is a moral problem, not a legal problem. To say something else about abortion, especially the clinics. I wish that abortion clinics would give more information about the procedure. Abortion is not simply taking a piece of tissue out of a woman's body. Abortion is taking a life away, and no one can argue that it's not.

IT'S BEEN SO LONG........I'm finally back from 130 hours of imprisonment in the Oregon Convention Center for the International Science and Engineering Fair.  Yeah the most common phrase over the last week for me was "Where are you from", gosh I've had to said it over 500 times............And from that I've met sooooooooooooo many people......from all 50 states and 38 countries around the world!!!!!!!!!!!! And the most valuable experience of this whole week was making such valuable friends.........And have the opportunity to meet future leaders, future billionaires, future Nobel Laureates, not to say that we had the chance to actually talk to the current Nobel Laureates.  And overall, there was TONS AND TONS OF FUN!!!!!! ENDLESS FUN....PARTYING EVERY NIGHT FROM SUNDAY NIGHT TO THURSDAY NIGHT...........More social activities the past week than I ever experienced in my life.  And tomorrow I'll have lots of fun tomorrow catching up with all the work I may have missed. And catch up on the current status of the impending party for our great APUSH teacher Ms.Clark.   And finally, I missed all of you the past week, hopefully you all had a fun week!  See ya all tomorrow!!!!!!

      APUSH Bloggers... I hope you realize that next time in ultimate frisbee the teams will be fair and you will all be subjected to the merciless wrath of he who is known as Rob.  Props to Frank for his beautiful catch, as well as disabling one of my best team mates, you are a worthy competitor.  I'm in support of JKo throwin a bitchin going-away party for Clark, and maybe next year we'll orginize a road trip to kick it with her in sea-town.  For any of you who enjoy the debates we sometimes have in class, I recommend you give Model United Nations a try.  I did, really enjoyed, and was fairly successful in my first competition.  Debate and compromise are great skills to develop, and MUN is an excellent medium for that.  Props to the Russian Federation on their team victory, and good job to everyone else that participated as well.  Love Rob

And I have to say you are definately one of the most talented and diligent classes I have ever had. So make sure you enjoy each other.  You are lucky to have a group of students who enjoy learning and thinking.  I expect great things from you in your Senior year and would love for you all to keep in touch!      Thomas I hope you are having a good time in Portland.  Make sure you get all the assignments that are due tomorrow.

      Well I would just like to thank Ms. Clark for being such an awesome teacher. Don't tell Mr. Emerson, but I felt that I was more prepared to take the AP history test this year than I was last year (but that could have been that I never really read the book last year)! I can honestly say that I feel bad for the sophomores who want to take AP US History next year, because they won't get Ms. Clark for a teacher. NOT to suck up or anything but I am really proud of you Ms. Clark because I am sure that this hasn't been your easiest year with the administration junk and all. But I am sure that you are happy that all your work has paid off and now you have a great job! So hooray! Plus now you can give us a bigger perspective on the journey of life! Hehe how is that for cheesy!

      APUSH bloggers... Although Forest Gump has a different, hilarious speech pattern, there is also a great deal of 50's and onward pop culture and history incorporated, and although the apex of the class is already behind us, viewing FG historically is an alternative and equally entertaining method of watching enjoying it.  Secondly, I want everyone's opinion on prom... the good, the bad, the ugly- and I don't mean Kolkmeyer's dress (JK Kolk, you looked hot and I love ya).  Would you want it at Union Station again?  Any feedback you can provide will help make next year's prom as ridiculously perfect as possible.  Congrats to Clark on her new job, but we'll miss ya next year.  Love Rob

      Hey Ms.Clark again, yeah thanks for the moral support.............Hmmmmm it's time to reflect.   Actually here I want to say thank you very much with my deepest appreciation for your great care and effort you put in as a teacher and administrator to support and help the Skyview students, and your efforts to make Skyview a better place.  Yeah and since this is the end of the AP test and, I have to say that this year has been a great experience in your AP US history class. I have learned and grown substantially both as an academic person and a contributing member of the Skyview community, thanks to the support of you and all of my great peers.  I know you will be leaving us next year, and I wish you the best luck as a vice principal and I'm sure all of my peers and I will miss you very much.    Yeah anyways Ms.Clark, you have been a GREAT AP US HISTORY TEACHER AND A GREAT ASB ADMINISTRATOR! I'll certainly miss you very much next year as I continue my journey through the Skyview storm.  And I'll come up and visit you sometimes.

      Hey my little dumplings...I am sure you did great on the test.  Take the Multiple Choice in perspecitive.  I am convinced if Tristan and Thomas thought it was hard...it was...and the test score is based on averages.    After hearing what the essay prompts were...I am convinced you did great.  In any event...you are all amazing people and have grown as readers, writers, and students.  I hope you will some day appreciate all of your efforts.  I can't wait to finish the last month of school with you...let's stay positive and have a good ending to a great year.  You truly are an amazing group of school.  Clark

      OH wow... RELIEF.  I was excited to take this test today because I was prepared!  History, unlike English, is a subject with definitive answers... it's an engine that needs all its parts to run correctly, and this morning I was purring like a ferrari on steroids!  Most of my answers I knew, atleast 60 of them I was able to narrow it down to two, and there were only three I wasn't able to answer at all!  I was soooo pleased, and the essays?  Right up my alley.  Don't take this the wrong way, I don't WANT to gloat, but I feel like I'm OBLIGATED to I feel so good about myself right now.  I'm sure everyone else did good too, because if you payed attention in class the last couple weeks, and reviewed a little bit then you had the tools for a 4 or 5.  If you want to get pissed at me for this self-glorifying post, you have that right... but make me feel good and praise me for my temporary genious!  Love, Rob

      Well, this test is over.......And which turmoil comes next??  Heh today's test (the multiple choice section) I completely threw up on............  Well first of all, the test commenced in an environment in which Zenson mistakenly said "This test consists of ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS AND SIX SHORT ANSWERS IN 55 MINUTES!"  And that just sent the room to completely dead silent with everyone stopped breathing!!!!!!!!!!!  And then the multiple choice section:  Soooooooooooooo HARD............SOOOOOOOO MUCH HARDER THAN ALL AND EVERY SINGLE PRACTICE MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST WE"VE EVER TAKEN!!!!!!!! Frank, Ryan, Tristan and many others would certainly agree with me. WHAT THE HECK?????????? About 80% of the questions were a wobble between two answers..........GOOD GOD I DID ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, SO SMALL PORTIONS OF THE QUESTIONS HAD A DEFINITIVE ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MATTER HOW MUCH HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE YOU KNEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 80% of the questions to anyone is just completely debatable.  Anyways, that's my extreme rant of the day.........I'd really like to hear others' opinions and afterthoughts about today's test. And oh yeah, have fun everybody the next week, I'll see you guys on May 17th.

      Anyways, Rob, when I mentioned to Matt "people like you", I was specifically referring to those people taking classes at Clark, and thus couldn't come to Skyview for the right classes because of the screwed up schedules.  But seriously good GOD lord, contrary to most people, to me, I actually have MORE stress now after taking this one AP test. Holy lord.....four more to go, four more battles to be fought.  Yeah I'll probably come to Skyview tomorrow after school review session just for the heck of getting in touch with society and conversing my mental state of stress with others (hopefully I don't contaminate other people with my stressed out minds).  All I have to say is that hopefully the History test goes better than today's kick-off AP test.

      Hey all you APers...I missed you today.  I walked around not knowing what to do with myself.  I hope you did well on the English test.    Tomorrow during class we will review post Civil War to ?????  After school we will work on AP prompts and stuff...make sure you are taking care of yourself.  Extra Credit Review Packets are due on Thursday - we will wait and have the AP celebration after all tests are done.    See you soon...

      Haha, Tom, I don't know what you mean by "people like you," but it made me laugh.  AP English really didn't bother me... I thought the multiple choice was on the easy side, answered all but four or five.  As for the essays, one will be good, the other two are a dice roll, there's no organization in so little time!!!  Anyway, the point is, one down, two to go...are we reviewing after school tomorrow?  Wanting to know if I should come.  Love, Rob

      Oh poor Matt.....Don't worry......Interview has absolutely nothing to do with what we are studying. I just had to bring it up to confuse you. (JUST KIDDING).  Anyways we are just review right now, in class and after school and on weekends.  I have to agree that WASL schedule did screw everyone over, especially people like you.

      What is wrong with hard working - I know many students/adults that would prefer not to be labeled hard working.  I also think it is the students or people who aren't afraid to work hard usually find the most success in life.  Depending, of course, how you measure success.  The interview - I SWEATED and STAMMERED and probably STUTTERED a few times.  I was interviewed by 15 different people.  It was a little different.  We will see if I get called into for a second.    This morning on NPR they did a nice show on Alexander Hamilton...they played up on his illegitimacy and being an orphan.  There is a new biography out on the man.   Are we ready to review Jackson to Mckinnely?  I am drinking coffee and taking notes as we speak.  For those of you who are unable to attend the APUSH review - Good Luck on the English Test...See you Tuesday.  How did people do on the Multiple Choice section?  Clark

      Here is an EXCELLENT article from "KidSource Online"  urlLink that provides insights into students' attitudes in schools with survey statistics and some common misconceptions. All students and especially teachers should take the time to read this article .   This statement below from that article is VERY true:    Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement:   Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.    And by the way, how did that interview go, Ms.Clark?

      Hey everyone........I guess today is Skyview's last day of school. I'm posting from the UW communications building computer lab.......UW is so nice! I am living in the infamous McMahon dorm. And our SIMUW group of 24 students is only a small fraction of ALL the countless number of high school/middle school students who are here for the summer living in McMahon. A lot of people are here for summer sports camps.   The McMahon dorm has a fantastic view of lake washington. The dorms are set up as a "quad", IE four dorm rooms in one vicinity sharing one living space/microwave/refrigerator/bathroom, and the best part, a balcony. The McMahon dorms is so oppressively hot (seems like the heat is always on even in 90 degree weather). The big windows are open with no wind coming in and yet the flies and bugs outside are attracted to the light inside. The first two nights the dorm is around 90 degrees and each room has one little fan to cool us off.......  As for the food, it's 1000 times better than anything we have in Skyview or nearby Salmon Creek. Each student gets $24.50 daily for food (all free).......Lots of stuff to gorge on........And some crazy SIMUW people buy dozen cartons of milks or drinks and freezes it overnight......crazy Ha one downside of the "quad" dorm is that eight people have to share one bathroom/one shower. So things can get interesting with shower/bathroom schedules.  The whole day spent here in UW is packed with stuff to do..........From 7:50 to 8:50 breakfast/community meetings.....From 9:00 to 12:00 morning lecture/activity.....1:30 to 4:00 afternoon lecture/activity.....4:15 to 5:00 computer alloted time.....5:30 to 6:30 dinner time, and afterwards free time to do whatever we want.  During the evening times we wander around the campus/dorms/travel to university avenue or university village shopping areas/movies/community solving math problems/or playing boardgames like monopoly or risk.   Yeah and finally the people here are so interesting.....just leave it at that.......Half of the people in this program are Canadians!!!!!!!!!! Ha............So interesting.

      My little dumplings...thank you so much for the nice send off.  I am so sorry I added to your anxiety and stress by not showing up on Thursday...Whoops!  I am very touched by your kind words and actions. I have the poster hanging in my condo amongst the boxes. I can honestly say I have never come across a more  caring and intelligent group of students.  I wish you the best of success in your senior year and your life.  The hardest part of this transition is saying goodbye to the students.  (I have teared more than once thinking about it.) You are truly amazing.  Please keep me posted on your life, college choices, etc.   You can reach me in July at sjclark68@hotmail.com or use the Shorecrest website...I will have an email account set up there soon.  I start work on Monday.  (Yikes)  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test...remember it is a tough test and your score may not always reflect what you have learned or know.  It is one test.    Last night I was watching 60 minutes...did anyone else see the Clinton interview?  What did you think...do you hate him or love him...how do you feel about the right wing conspiracy? Will he be able to live down the impeachment trial...was the impeachment fair?  It is odd...the last couple of weeks have focused on celebrating the Republican agenda in remembering Ronald Reagan...now Clinton's book and Farehneit 911 is coming out...there should be some interesting debates and discussions to blog about.  I do like what Clinton said about hate...there is no reason to hate a political figure but be able to disagree with their stance and opinion.   Thomas...I hope you are having a good time in Seattle.    Keep on blogging...I would also love to hear about the trips to Germany, China, and Georgetown...  Love ya, Ms. Clark,

      Well, I woke up and realized this college project is due next week, so I decided I had better get started.  Instead of using class time to do work I played computer games and now on a beautiful day like today I'm trapped inside until I finish my project.  Just my luck.  Have a great weekend and don't forget Father's Day is tomorrow.

      Wow, I just started blogging not to long ago, but I think it's fun.  To bad the year is almost over.  This college project we have to do in clark's is actually going to be very useful.  Well, if I follow it anyways.  I think I will though, I've already applied for scholarships that I would have never done if not for this project, and I Think I'm going to make it my summer goal to apply for at least 10 a month.  Get what I can out of scholarship money.  I also like the idea of applying to every school that is free to apply to across the country, just to make them all compete over me.  Anyways, I'm going ot bed.  I Need the sleep. ~CT

      Hey All MY AP US HISTORY BUDDIES!  Today's my last day of school........I'm going up to UW for six weeks. I have to say that this year has been an awesome year in CLARK's AP US HISTORY class. Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially.   So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced.   Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class!  FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!!  Best Wishes  Thomas Chen

      Ahoy bloggers!  This is Sydney and Livy and it's the first time either of us has ever blogged.  I guess we're a little slow, considering there are only 3 days of school left this year.  Isn't that splendid.  We have decided that since so many people are disgusted with childhood obesity, we're going to do a little experiment on the issue ... So we're going to see how long it takes us to become obese.  This experiment will involve a lot of poptarts and chocolate.  Ummm we can't start right now though because we're sitting in history class right now, doing "college research."  Well, since this is probably the only blog that Livy and Syd will ever write - everyone have a scrumtrilescent summer and don't be too smart! - May the God of Poptarts smile down upon you all, Olivia Guest Pellegrom and Sydney Lauren Clos

      Ok.....I guess I was a hypocrite on my last post when I complained about people being up at 3:00AM.....Well this post here is a 3:00AM post on a Tuesday Morning! YAY Well there were justified reasons for this early post because a few hours ago I was still at the amphitheater attending the class of 2004 Graduation Ceremony.  Since half of all my friends are seniors, the ceremony was rather nostalgic and emotional and it's unbelievable that some of your friends are already graduating, and forever ending 12 years of public education career! And yeah.....I saw Clark and VA there, and Evan Cate's speech was astounding.  I'll miss those seniors very much.......AND THE CLASS OF 2005, WE HAVE TO BEAT ALL THE STANDARDS THEY HAVE SET!!!!! WE HAVE TO BE BETTER!

      Ok, I LOVE how everyone keeps saying they think that the discussion on friday was AWESOME, but on to the next topic, we have to present out books...Will Clark mind if I switched books?  my hitler Mein Kompf or however its spelled never came in, so I read to Kill a Mocking Bird, or of Mice and Men...yes, they were my english class books, but hey, I can present on them!  I read them!  I think this project we're doing is HUGE by the way, I just finished the calender thing we had to do...ugh...any suggestions on how to make this go faster? ~CT

      I was pretty happy with the way the debate went of Friday too, except, unlike the ones everyone else has posted about, mine got pretty heated, and for the first time, I was probably one of the quietest people in the group! But, while I was preparing for the debate, I talked to some of my senior friends about the issue, and i asked them if they knew anything about it. I was surprised to find that most of them didn't have a clue what the difference is between the two party's economic policies...they didn't even care! I was surprised b/c the elections are coming up quickly. You'd think that people would want to know about the policies that each party is proposing so they could make an educated decision and vote for the party they relate most with. I mean, I guess it makes sense though. The policies on gay marriage and the war in Iraq are getting so much more media attention. How are people supposed to know what the different parties are proposing unless they are given that information on the news or on the front page of the newspaper? Which is kind of interesting to think about: why dont the parties make their economic policies easier for the public to get a hold of? Do they really expect Americans to go searching for the information...NO! Please, we are all so lazy (I'm making a huge generalization here) that we want the information fed to us through television and bullet points. We dont want to take the time out of our busy schedules to find all the different policies out. I guess it's just a little something to think about...why are gay rights and the war getting more attention than an issue that directly affects every single American?

      I, too, liked the debate on Friday.  I love getting other peoples perspectives on these issues - which are SOOO complex.  Personally, I wish we could talk about taxes and the like the rest of the school year, instead of do this project!  Has anyone started writing their "Describe Yourself" essay for the applications?  I did, it took me 45 minutes to write the first two paragraphs.  So muych pressure - those things have to be PERFECT!  Well, anyway in the end I'm going to be very thankful to Ms. Clark for making us do this stuff now, not in the midst of Senior year!

      First of all, Corey and Julie, what are you people doing and 1AM and 3AM???? Go to sleep, it's good for you. Wow making food that early in the morning.....Crazy people.   I agree with Hilary's statement of older people generally carrying stereotypical views towards teenagers. One reason this may arise is the fact that teenagers really don't care about politics that much, only around 19% of 18-21 year olds vote! How sad! And then we complain about how the government only cares about healthcare/medicare, and we never get what we want......Well it's because we don't vote!!!!!!  It's really a damaging and detrimental cycle of teenagers not voting, then we don't get what we want, and then we teenagers think we are not important in the society and our vote doesn't make a difference, so then we don't vote......It's bad for our society.   AND THUS, SPEAKING OUT, AND VOTE!!!!!!!!!!! Voice your strong oppositions whenever you feel like it........And don't always let your parents vote FOR YOU...... I believe we should have more of those last friday's discussion types so more people can get involved in politics and research into what our country is actually doing, which directly affects everyone of us when we go to college and worrying about our financial crisis......And maybe military draft.   Everyone of you can start by just going to the schoolboard meetings........It's the first step towards understanding how our nation's bureaucracy works and how their policies directly affect everyone of us.   That's why Rob's honorable plan of sacrificing his vote for the vote of the whole school during the November election is such an unprecedented plan!

      I really liked the debate that we had last Friday. I thought that most of us were mature enough to listen properly and respect the views and values of our peers. I hate how our generation is made out to be irresponsible and wild, but I just wish that some of the older generations wouldn't classify all of us, because not everyone is lazy and crazy! I guess that I hope that I won't stereotype teenagers when I am old and rusty. Plus I think that with the knowledge that is available and the born genius' who are at Skyview, the future will be a better place than it is today!

      The debate on Friday went rather well.  The group I was with was pretty evenly split as for Rep or Dem, however we managed to not let it get too heated.  One of the main topics we focused on was tax cuts, which I learned a lot from.  I'm not into politics that much, but I do want to know more about the presidential candidates so I can vote in what I believe.  But as for now I'm making chocolate chip cookies, nothing beats homemade.

      Is it just me, but at 1 in the morning, you start to get hungry for breakfast?  Last time I was up this late (last night) I made pancakes, this time I have Belgian mini cream puffs, so good!  only about 8 bux at albertsons for about 30 of them, in the frozen dessert section in case anyone wants to try them.  If they have the mini eclairs, those are better.  Personally I could go for a Jack in the Box's Spicy Chicken Sandwhich...  followed by some x-box.  Oh ya, I didn't like that "discussion" we had on friday, everyone got so off topic so much, go from taxes to well-fare, to zoneing laws... ~CT (goin to get some food from J in the B)

      While my family and I were watching former President Reagan's funeral, my dad told me that while a President is in office they have to plan their funeral just in case they die in office. Now that's what I call planning ahead. You see, I remember the flag folding part of former President Nixon's funeral when I was little, and I hear that the other aspects of his funeral was rather simplistic. But then my dad busts out and says that Nixon was a Quaker. Thus, it was likely that his funeral was planned to be more simplistic and small... just the way he wanted it. I asked my dad if there was more media coverage on Reagan than there was with Nixon, and he said no, there was an equal amount. So if anyone wants to compare the extravagency between the two deaths, it was planned for Nixon's funeral to be more private and not so much exposed. So, maybe it's not because of the Watergate Scandal that Nixon's funeral wasn't as "big" as Reagan's.  I have to say that it makes me sick that some are speaking ill of Reagan. They're so focused on their politics that they can't even respect the former president. They say things like, "oh he was responsible for the spread of AIDS". Don't they know that he spent 6 billion dollars for the research of AIDS? I guess not, because they don't want to research the facts. How is it that they're able to speak of him that way even in his death? Someone in my history class once said, "Don't speak ill of the dead" and I totally believe that. Respect is key. Even if a certain president passed away, and his policies were ones that I don't agree with, I would still have respect enough to not argue against him, or attempt to discredit him. Some of you might be thinking, "Oh well you're a conservative so it's easy for you to say that now, since it's Reagan that died". NO, that's not the case. It's not hard to have respect for the dead, especially ones that DID serve our country, democrat or republican, liberal or conservative. If you want to argue or discredit any politicians, I ask that you please do it with the ones that are alive. Please.

      When I was researching for tomorrow's debate, I found many websites that seemed bias and quick to insult the opposing party's policies. I personally think that people should try and have open minds about the opposing position because it could give them more of a perspective on not only the opposite side, but their own side, too. I am glad that we are researching this topic because we need to see how the economic policy that Bush has implemented will affect us in the future. From the articles that I read though, it seems as though Bush's 10-year plan is trying to help the middle class when it will most likely benefit to the wealthy instead. Now it is hard for me to believe everything that one reporter thought, so I am going to look for more facts and see if Bush's plan is actually helping America and not just cutting taxes and putting more of a burden on the middle class. Hope everyone has a good night!

      So today I asked my parents what they thought about Reagan. My mom replied, "O I loved my puppy." "Yes" I said, I'm sure you loved your dog as a kid up but I'm talking about the president." Anyway, they don't care too much about president Reagan. They get very frustrated with the government and politics. They are rather liberal and quick to criticize. Anyway I was doing some research and I agree with Joe that Reagan's administration ended up raising taxes, and while Reagan stated that he would "get government off our backs" he ended up increasing the role of the federal government.

      Its interesting that people remember Reagon for cutting taxes and reducing the size of the governemnt, but in reality his administration raised taxes more than any other, and increased the size of the federal government.  He tried cutting taxes and cutting social programs, but it didnt work.  Also, he was in power during the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, but what did he do to educate the public about the problem?  Nothing.   Also, people say he was great because he wasnt an "intelectual," like George W.  Isnt that a nice way of saying he was stupid?  I hardly see how that was a good thing.  ~Joseph Liberman

      Ryan, I agree that unabashed, unashamed, mudslinging political rhetoric poisons the mind! This may sound contradictory considering that a large portion of my posts include some sort of stab at Bush, but not EVERY issue. I listen to political talk radio for entertainment, not news. Lars Larson comes on at night and talks about how Abu Ghraib is a positive reflection on the Bush presidency, then Sean Hannity comes on and rants on how lame Bush is for not politically castrating, then executing Don Rumsfeld. Am I a fan of Bush or Rumsfeld? No. Do I think Abu Ghraib is the fault of either, no. I actually commend Rumsfeld on trying to delay the release of the photos— at least the man recognized the way of harm his boys would be put directly into as a result. Atleast I get a good laugh before I fall asleep. I understand why they do what they do. Mudslinging IS entertaining, the problem is, the political extremists that get put on the air collect a FOLLOWING for their charisma and idealism. It's rare that their is a perfect candidate for anyone, so in many ways, I could liken the popularity of a man like Michael Savage to the rise of Hitler in Germany. Many Americans feel that our government is gutless to act, and a man like Savage is all about American empowerment. With such political polarity being generated from CNN to Fox News everyone in the media, imagine the cult following a political MODERATE might generate! Talk about extremism!  Now the Bible. So often in history we praises the founding fathers for their briliance in drafting the Constitution. Leaving it open to interpretation, casting it in putty rather than in steel so it can mold as times change. Maybe God should deserve the same type of credit so often to the "revolutionary thinkers" of the late 18th century. Everyone interprites the Holy Bible differently, and that is generally accepted by everybody, but this is the first time I've really thought it might be part of the design. I guess the most important fact is that people are looking to God for an answer, and for that, I commend them. God is an invaluable resource. For any atheists out there, you're alright by me too, but get to know what's out there, you might find a doctrine you like.  Al Tu and I have decided that the U.S. should return to a monetary system similar to that of the Gold Standard, but slightly different. The beer standard. All government issued coins and bills would be backed by their value in beer. Also, all informal college sports bets would be transacted exclusively in beer. Long live the Greek System.

           So, for all of you who haven't heard of the issue of Multiculturalsim it may be time you have. What is Multiculturalism? Well, my personal definition and opinion is that multiculturalism is racism in a politically-correct guise. It holds that an individual’s identity and personal worth are determined by ethnic/racial membership and that all cultures are of equal worth, regardless of their moral views or how they treat people. Multiculturalism holds that ethnic identity should be a central factor in educational and social policy decisions. Multiculturalism would turn this country into a collection of separatist groups competing with each other for power. So what do you think?    Jon G.

          I have a similar story to that regard. I was a pro-choice dude till my frosh year. I remember a friend who even confided with me a few times that she was going to abort her 4 month old fetus; she'd told her mom, and part, if not all, of it was based around fear of her father. But the incident that really got me thinking was the night before we at Pendleton H.S. left for a district acting compostition in Portland. We were performing our skits and monolgoues for an audience, and one was about this girl whose mother forced her to abort her child, and then ran away from her mother, who kept trying to find her and bring her home. The daughter wouldn't, since she'd killed off a living thing in her womb. It was all along those lines, and I lost all pretensions for abortion (including the for population control bit). That piece of acting was especially powerful, and it gave me a very personal look at the whole issue. It is something living to me, regardless of its cognizance of its state, for it's growing and is a nutrient-needing being, possessing of a soul. That's how I feel.

      I know how so many of you have complained about bringing up things that have already been brought up, but I really wanted to tell you all about something I learned this morning during my first period class.  I was talking to one of my friends, and she told me that her sister (who is 19 years old) got pregnant about a month ago.  The baby's wonderful and everything's fine, but I then my friend told me that her sister is considering getting an abortion instead of having the baby.  Before hearing that, I had been fine with abortion.  I don't consider it to be killing a life because it doesn't really have life yet, and I was totally pro-choice and all that.  But after hearing that one of my friend's sisters is considering getting an abortion...it just made me so sad that she would do that.  Maybe it's just because of the personal connection, but I just don't view abortion the same today as I did yesterday.  My friend is so excited to be an aunt! And just to take that away from her and everything, just because it would be the easy way out just doesn't seem right to me anymore.  I may be over emotional or something like that, but hey.  It's all good to me!  I know that this is an old topic, so you all don't really have to respond to it or anything, I just view abortion completely differently now that I have a more personal connection with it.

          Ryan, your points are perfectly valid. I found myself reading some info sheets on economic policy last night, and I found myself very engrossed in it. It was either "Look what Bush's economic policies are doing for us positively" or the opposite. I found some valid facts, but also language that was deliberate, a spin to catch the public. I too often despise the political mire, and it can disgust me how politicians can continue to bicker endlessly along partisan lines till the cows come home, and there aren't any cows in D.C. Partisanship makes me mad, it was one of the reasons I was so ticked reading the stuff in the text book a month back on Richard Nixon - the old heated partisan warrior. You put this whole bickering gig in historical perspective, and I love that. Much more fighting than helping has ever been done in this country; truly, in the entire history of man. There's to much to loose for all our politicians to work together.      I'm going to become slightly partisan here, it may seem, but this is what I observed when reading yesterday: that we've been getting jobs back the last three months, but we lost several million in the past three years. There were some cool things that we have coming, but a lot of crap happened too. I hate that I'm not being specific, but I've got the stuff on me, so if you'd like I could show it to you, and I was carefully looking at this info, trying to be objective. I seem to have more bias against the Bush administration than the opposite side, but I saw that in myself and tried to look in that same light on those critical of the administration. Both sides have some valid points, but for me I'm not much of a Reaganomics guy, which we're living with under President Bush. I like that I'm reasearching, and it keeps me informed. I also don't like these tax cuts. To me, a government needs its money, its surpluses. We need the programs that the government provides - they should be limited so that people can't take advantage of them, but you need to have well funded programs. Raegan cut taxes, aznd limited funfding for some of these programs. I also wonder at these stats in the course of my research, whether they were caused by Bush's policies directly, or are a part of regular economic rise and fall, or both.     I hated being on the pro-George site, 'cause it was so obvious that they were trying to use stuff like patriotism to catch unwary voters for them. Both sides do it, and it disgusted me that they were trying to Big Brother me and take me for most of this country's citizens - uniformed, idiotic voters. Yet the uninformed part is more true, and I'm being judgmental to an extent. Just always be informed, go beyond the surface and see what's really going on. If you don't like George for instance, know why, and if you want something new, make sure Kerry would institute the policies that you would want; don't just vote a man in to get rid of another. I pray that we may have the best for this country. Adios and God bless.  Tristan

      Congratulations...you have made the blog work.  Your writing is interesting and lively.  It is actually fun to read because you aren't worried about getting a grade but more worried about making a point while entertaining your blogger friends.  I know many of you are tired of the GM issue but I think you made a lot of progress...there is a lot to think and evaluate on this issue...and will continue to be topic for discussion as many individuals continue to press the issue.  Ryan...great insight...I would love for John Kerry to embrace McCaine as his running mate.  Wouldn't that be an interesting team.  However, through the bias and hidden agendas we have made progress in many issues.  The history of America has been a struggle to define ourselves.  Every step of the way issues, beliefs, and ideologies have been challenged.  Howard Zinn has an interesting book called..."You Can't Stay Neutral on a Moving Train!"  He makes a great point.  It is nearly impossible to be completely objective based on your life experiences. However, I do think it is important to challenge yourself to think, listen and learn.  No one has all the answers...  How are you doing on your Democrat V. Republican economic policies? Can you share some interesting websites?  Also I wanted to remind you about the AP Party tomorrow night.  It should be fun.  Bring a shirt, a sharpie and dessert....you may want to team up with a couple people in the dessert bringing.    Good work...your blog is enjoyable to read...keep it interesting and informative.   Many of you seem mature beyond your years.  Gertie

      I abhor politics by nature because opinionated writers are unable to present facts without intertwining their own agenda.  As a student I process information daily, and have found the most effective way to learn concepts is through evaluating raw facts, and analyzing relationships between themes.  In politics I find this straightforward analysis nearly impossible because no source presents all of the facts on a single issue; instead, columnists selectively use facts to win imaginary arguments.  As a result, I find myself repulsed by political reporting.  I’m torn between the desire to learn about the world around me and the intense repugnance I feel toward the political media.  People make politics personal, which is unnecessary and detracts from progress.  I dream of a world where opposing political parties can discuss issues and make decisions based on what’s best for the nation and not what’s best for their respective organizations; however, I understand this is the nature of politics; they are purely subjective.    America is a half-constructed bridge, spanning the continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and the political parties are the construction team responsible for the next phase in building.  Because the political parties are on the same team it would seem logical for them to work together to build the strongest structure possible; however, since their inception they spent more time waging wars and fighting than planning for the future.  Government officials should be driven by building the best nation possible, not lining their pockets or making a name for themselves.  Unfortunately, this is seldom the case and the root of my inner conflict.  The role of the government is to create a healthy, sound country, and far too many politicians lose sight of this goal for me to follow avidly; however, because the fate of the nation depends on voters, I and others like me must swim through the political gobbledegook and get to the heart of the issues – I just wish I didn’t have to wear waders to do it.    -Ryan  PS - I admire all of you who closely follow politics and respect your opinions greatly

      It is funny that you drive on a parkway, and park on a driveway.  Also, I get high on a freeway, but freebase on a highway.  Curious.  Anyway, the Mariners have so much potential.  Promising start last night by rookie Clint Nageotte (pronounced na-zhot) who gave up 0 runs in six innings.  The largest Mariner problem has been synchronizing offense and defense (one has one f, the other has two).  Mariner's starters Joel Pinero and Freddy Garcia each have excellent ERA's, yet abismal records.  Lastly, the Pistons can beat the Lakers, and I see the finals as a tossup.  Anyone that thinks the Lakers are going to coast by anther lame-ass eastern conference team has another thing coming.  That thing is the ridiculously powerful Wallace and Wallace combo, Tayshaun Prince guarding Kobe, and my boy Rip Hamilton who took a page out of Jesse T's book and wears the Hannibal mask on his way to being the Piston's postseason leading scorer.  I prefer my TP hanging under, and I'll fight that to the death with Biblical references to back it up.  Love, Rob  P.S.  To all you concerned little kiddies in blogger land, Mary and I are good friends and remain to be good friends.  Last night we saw the Presidents of The United States of America play the Rose Festival.  I can say with 100% confidence it was the best concert I've ever seen for $5.  Long live Lump, Kitty, Peaches, and The Groovin Postman.

      CT brings up a good point... you do park on a driveway and drive on a parkway... weird.... anyway, we do need a new topic to talk about.. I haven't blogged for awhile, and I see we're still on GM.. From what I'm reading, its a touchy subject. personally, i agree with Rob.. I'm uncomfortable seeing it, but its not immoral. Yesterday, I saw a truck with a sticker that had this: Marriage = Man + Woman for a moment, i considered hitting him... but i enjoy driving, and if i hit someone, i will not be driving. People are quoting the Bible and such, but when it comes down to it, I believe that the big stink about GM is that most people are uncomfortable with the thought of GM, so they get other people riled up about it, and now its a hot subject. There's my two cents, and its time for a new subject to talk about...  uhh... hmm.... erm... why did the chicken cross the road? there's a website with how other people would answer: www.chickenjoke.com there. Laughter is the bestest medicine, so laugh it up!

      Something else to talk about?  I finally got on this blog, there's one thing.  But another is that friggen Ronald Reagon.  My dad went off on him about him being the last president he liked that America's had.  I really haven't looked up anything about him, and probably am not, but from what I hear, he must've been a good guy.  Still not interesting enough for something new to talk about?  How about You park on a drive way and drive on a park way...discuss... ~CT

      Just an interesting fact: in order to have your painting be exhibited at the Louvre you have to be dead for at least sixty years. I just don't understand why do you have to be dead before you can become famous or a hero. Look at Socrates who had been tried and killed for his work of science, or Copernicus who had been called a heretic for his proposal of the sun being the center of the universe, or Mozart who was buried in a common group grave; or Beethoven who was poor, deaf, and unacclaimed during his life; or Bach who was also poor with ten kids, and in a constant struggle with his employers - all famous composers after their death; or look at Van Goh who died poor, drunk and unknown for his great paintings; or the writers such as Solzhenicin and Pasternak who have been banished and sent into exile and now are known worldwide for their great works of literature. They all have been famous after death and will continue to be celebrated for centuries to come and yet during their life times they were either banished and criticized for their work or drunk, poor and struggling for survival. Now I got a bit off topic here. I was going to talk about Reagan and got carried away with my appraisal of true heroes. I hear everyone talk about Reagan and how great he is but really what was so great about him? It seems as if everyone forgot about him and his great deeds for a decade and bothered to discover a hero in him only as soon as he died. So what do you think he did that was so great, I didn't really remember him being a major personae in the APUSH book.   P.S. I just want to mention that no one won the Cold War, and no one destroyed the USSR. It destroyed itself, it simply had a malignant cancer which killed it from inside out. It's actually very interesting to hear and observe different perspectives on the issue of Cold War.

      I'm trying frantically to come up with something else to discuss so that we can get off the gay marriage issue.  So what kind of peanut butter do you all prefer: crunchy, or creamy?  Do you put the toilet paper so it rolls from underneath, or over top?  Doritos or Cheetos?  Haha, I'm just rambling now, but we desperately need something else to talk about on here.

      Hey Chris, Mary, Rob, and Natalya........WOWWWWWWWW WHAT AN ECLECTIC GROUP OF VOCAL AP US HISTORY STUDENTS!!!!!!!! I'm actually really glad that there is HEATED DEBATE about such a controversial topic as Gay Marriage.   It's so great to see that at the end or beginning of your posts, Rob and Mary, that you two have to reconcille with each other that you love each other.  Because we are all still great friends, no matter what difference of opinions we have. Yeah true friendship has to be able to withstand political debates!    Chris, I honor your detailed analysis of the motives/arguments/reasonings behind both polarized sides of this GM issue......Your post sounded like a mature moderator's post trying to bring together the two sides. However, I have to dissagree with you on one important fact, and that is, the Gay Marriage debate will not always go around in circles. Not everyone in the country (on both sides) is willing to sit idly and let the gay marriage issue be pushed out of debate like a gag order. Even if the issue of gay marriage will not be resolved for decades......It will eventually be ......No matter what end of political spectrum America's general populace stands, there are and WILL ALWAYS be the progressives who will change America forever. And here I have to insert my own personal opinion (WAAAAAA SCARY PERSONAL OPINION)......That I really hope the resolved will forever legalize gay marriage. And I'm convinced along with a lot of my peers that if America continues its 250 years of journey in the pursuit for the real meaning of freedom and democracy, that Gay Marriage will eventually be legalized.   But this can be a long wait........Maybe many decades......But I'm convinced that eventually it will happen.  Simply looking at America's past, you'll see that altho there are short term regressions to more goold old traditional fundamental values, the general path of America's history has always been taking the step to become more progressive and democratic and egalitarian (For such important issues now we take granted such as: From the first ten amendments to: ALL MEN'S SUFFRAGE, Public Education, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY, Women's right to vote, Separation of Church and State (including teaching evolution), Trust-Busting policies on monopolies, Social Securities, Healthcare/Medicare, Minimum Wage, Conservation, De-Segregation, Civil Rights, Sexual Revolution, Non-Discriminatory Clause(There the disabled gained their rights), And finally African American's Rights to Vote ). And shorterm regression of more conservative values such as prohibition on Alcohol and Jim Crow Lows just DID NOT WORK AND DID NOT LAST. Just looking at your parents and grandparents, which generation is more "conservative", which generation is more "free" or which generation strives for more freedom? (56% of 17-24 year olds suport GM as opposed to 19% 65 years and over). The more recent list that I will eventually able to add to the list of America's journey towards the true democratic values has become abortion and gay marriage.  And at the end, I love everybody here who has contributed to the great DISCUSSION OF OUR AP US HISTORY BLOG!

      All I have to say is that Rob said everything there was to say. I mean the fact that no matter what kind or how many arguments you bring forward, every person will still hold back to his/her own views/believes. I just wish people weren't so judgmental and close-minded, dividing the world into wrong or right, moral/immoral, good/bad. I personally believe that all of us have our own ten/twenty or however many commandments that we hold close to our hearts and which are precisely the reflections of our views on life based on our OWN individual experiences. That's the primary reason why I call myself "partially religious" and of course because I believe in God in my own special way... So therefore I invite you all to convert to Buddhism in order to experience the eternal happiness in the state of Nirvana... Long life to Allah.

      Rob and Mary, thinking of you two going head to head gives me the urge to get on a plane and leave the country. But nontheless I have been reading the arguments on the blog lately with interest. Both Rob and Mary both have very valid points and I'm sure if given the chance they would contradict one another into the next millenium. But the fact is and I quote Rob,"one thing I have learned through the GM debate is that you won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise." So these arguments stewed up by the bright minds of our Ap US history class are hopeless,  in the end it all comes down to what you believe in as an individual. For example: Mary holds strongly to her faith, a virtue of which every question derived from the bible comes down to for answer, and uses this belief to battle and contradict Rob's arguments, while Rob uses modern situations as proof to regard or disregard arguments like Marys that are based upon faith. Both of these strong willed individuals represent 2 of the many separate groups in the battle for gay marriage, each group possessing a strong and opinionated following. The only problem with this situation is that neither group appears to be morally wrong in their thinking, and therefore there is not an easy way to chose sides. Due to this the battle for gay marriage will go around in circles in vain attempts of each side of the argument to gain a majority on the matter. But with each argument presented by each of the opposite viewed sides there will be arguments to address the stated argument and arguments to address the stated arguments argument, and with each contradiction those groups will move further apart from eachother as characteristic human stubborness is triggered with the attack on ones argument. With this reasoning in mind, I don't think that gay marriage will be legalized throughout the United States for quite some time. No one can expect a drastic idea such a same sex marriage to be accepted by a society of people who have been morally against the idea of homosexuality their entire lives. And with that I think I can safely say that I am sick of talking about it.

      I feel that the gay marriage discussion has gone on WAY to long, and that it is time to find a new topic.  However, I do have one thing to say on the issue. If anyone is against gay marriage, than please, don’t marry someone of your own gender.  Why can't we just live our own lives, instead of trying to control every one else?  If people just focused on their own morals, instead of trying to force everyone else to think how they do, than the world would be a much better place.  ~Joseph

      I feel like I've been polluting the blog recently (throwback to globabl warming which Ryan Knight claims is a myth) with my GM posts, and so I plan on leaving it with this last post on the topic.  It's not that I'll give up backing it till it's legal, so feel free to talk to me in person, but I've decided it's alright for the blog to go another direction.  So here it is.  Mary, I appreciate your love for me, and I hope you know it's entirely reciprocal, but I also hope you know that the Bible means no more to you than it does to me.  I hope I've made it clear that I'm familiar with what the Bible has to say, and CLEARLY we have different interpretations (I guesss neither of us can call either interpretation WRONG), but I can confidently say right now that every human in the world has a bias.  It's human nature to have some sort of preconceived notion, some unfaltering instinct that affects how we see the world.  Part of our bias comes from the society we live in.  We have our cultural norms, our milieus or what have you that would make aspects of the culture in our neighbors of Mexico and Canada confusing at times.  Mexicans have a very different view of personal space, not afraid to come sit right down next to you on an empty bus.  As the egotistical douche yet talented film-maker Michael Moore demonstrated in Bowling For Columbine, Canadians don't feel the need to lock their doors at night.  A scenario many not feel comfortable with in their homes in the states.  My point is that when it says in Romans that men turned to other men in unnatural lust, in Roman society homosexuality was not considered normal, especially not natural.  I myself get uncomfortable seeing men kissing (..."I am beautiful, no matter what they say..."), but I don't see it as immoral.  When there is a natural inclination to repel homosexuality combined with a society even less friendly to gays, bias plays a factor in Paul's writing.  Do you see where I'm coming from?  I'm not trying to discredit any of the apostles, but I do want to remind the world that they can't be expected to be any more than human.  (For the record, I'm referencing the New Testament exclusively because Mary referred to herself as a judeo-christian.  If you want my argument against the Old Testament, jump back a couple weeks worth of posts)  Moving on to data.  Even if Rush does cite his sources, they could be the product of any number of think tanks funded by any number of VERY biased corporations.  Tobacco did all kinds of studies saying how bad tobacco WASN'T for you.  I think NPR would be one of the most direct sources of info out there.  If you don't want to believe Sean Hannity, I don't really either, but you can trust a credible source like an NPR newsbreak.  Lastly because I'm a left-winged secularist who only gets A's because I wright what teachers want to hear politcally, let me back up one more statement with imperical data; going after your spelling was a good natured ribbing, but you were 1/9 in spelling marriage correctly.  (Take that whole last paragraph in a sarcastic tone, but the data I believe to be correct.  Do you want me to reference my source?)  My last statement will address you not agreeing with homosexuality.  Why not?  You know my arguments, and I guess you can say because that's your morality, but there IS a basis for morality.  I just want to know what yours is.  By the way, I LOVE Mary Tyner as a human being.  The great thing about this country is that we're all allowed to have our beliefs and opinions, share them with each other, and be homies at the end of the day.  Love Rob

      Thanks for the response Bob. You sure can quote stuff. By the way, I know how to spell marrIAge, it was just a typo. That was kind of a cheap shot. I find it amazing, though, how you can quote this, and quote that, but yet you don't know what verses mean. Again, people taking such an objective view when they regard the bible. You don't know how to interpret. Or is it that I interpret it differently? Obviously, there is a difference between us in what we regard as the truth. (By the way, Rush always tells his audience what his sources are, or if what he's saying is his opinion.) When it comes to the bible/religious stuff, there's a difference between having faith in a religion, or just believing in it. For me, it's faith. It's not that I take every single word in the bible and take it literally. That's not the intent. Just a note... Jesus, in his teachings, spoke metaphorically, or through examples and stories so he could teach his disciples. Thus, not everything is to be taken literally. These disciples, who you call bias, are the ones who have the first hand account and have written these accounts in their books Mark, Luke, John and so on. If you have faith, you don't think of these men as biased figures who totally disregard the views of others. I'm not saying don't ever question these men and do everything they say, they are the new gods now... ahhhh! What I'm saying is that these men, these disciples, in regards to christianity, are telling what they know, are telling what Jesus taught them. What I'm saying in all of this mumbo jumbo is to be careful when you use the bible for reference, everyone, because when you use the bible, you're entering the territory of religion, and you're right rob this is a history class, not a theology class.   If you really want to know my direct opinion on Gay Marriage, I'm against it. But the question is, to what extent? I don't even know the answer to that question, because I'm not against gay people. But I am against the lifestyle. I'll go along like it's normal, which is called tolerance, but inside my head I'll be thinking it's wrong and there's no way you can change that, the same way I can't change you. But I dare you to try.  Back to data, it's not like I don't use it. I QUESTION every blatant piece of data to ASSESS THE VALIDITY OF THE STATEMENT (haha, never thought I'd hear that outside the AP exam). I question not only the liberals, but also conservatives. I question my side as well because I want to make sure that I know what it is I'm believing in/ have faith in. Always ask questions. And make them simple questions too. That way, if you don't get a straight forward, simple answer, then you know that that person who is answering the question is BS'ing with you. So no, Robby Bobby, I don't just go with my gut feeling alone. I know the facts first, I repeat THE FACTS first, and then I perhaps use my gut/mind/brain/head, whatever you want to call it, that makes me decide what it is I say, do, think and stuff.   Thanks for the response. I love you Rob.

      Mary, I admire your commitment to your statements.  It's easy to hide behind rhetoric and avoid conflict, but by standing by what you say and inviting opposition you show tremendous security.  I would first like to address your alarmingly confrontational attitude towards numbers and statistics.  You are correct that data collections can be interpreted many different ways, and are often presented strategically to convey a certain point of view, but by no means is that always the case.  With my personal experience I find the majority number twisters to be those on political talk shows, including your beloved Rush Limbaugh.  Al Franken does the same thing, and I'm not trying to say it's strictly a conservative thing, but try and argue with the fact that states at the time of this post, approximately 117 billions of American dollars have been spent on the war in Iraq.  Or that since the invasion, 828 Americans have lost their lives in combat.  Tell me that statistic can be twisted to comfort the mothers, fathers, wives, husbands, and children of those lost in Iraq.  If you don't base decisions, viewpoints, etc. on "imperical data," what exactly DO you base them on?  Gut feeling?  Gut feeling gets you the Salem Witch trials.  A clever little process known as the Scientific Method led the world out of The Dark Ages and into the Renaissance and is responsible for the development and institution of MODERN MEDICINE.  If I had cancer, gut instinct wouldn't lead me to subject myself to chemotherapy or radiation treatment— both cell-anhialating and physically exhausting therapies, but the imperical data that shows that survival rate is MUCH higher with those treatments would probably sway my thinking.  Moving on to your GM argument, I'm still unclear.  Do you believe that GM should be legal?  Clearly you have stated you do not support it based on the Bible, that is, the New Testament, but based on the current law, do you believe that amending the Constitution to ban GM is legal?  One thing I have learned through the GM debate is that I won't be able to convince anyone to drastically alter their position, based on religion or otherwise.  I have tried and tried, typed countless words, referencing countless verses, and yet I have done little to directly express what I keep alluding to: The Bible, New Testament or Old, is not an infallible source.  The most direct reference to homosexuality in the New Testament comes from Romans, which loosely states that men turned to men and committed unnatural acts out of lust.  It does not say that homosexuality is wrong, just "unnatural."  With that out of the way let me remind everyone that the New Testament is not document written by the hand of God, or even translated from God's divine mouth as some of the Old Testament was.  The New Testament is a collection of first-hand accounts with Jesus from various people; the Romans, Mark, Jude, etc.  The point is, the reader of the Gospel must remember that this collection of accounts is at all times subject to the author's bias, and even the deviation from the original meaning through years of translation.  For all anyone knows, "unnatural" as it was written might have been more accurately translated as "unconventional."  The Bible, New Testament and Old, contains excellent themes on how to live ones life as well as the most redeeming sacrifice of the Son of God for eternal souls of all us sinners, but it is not a document that can be taken word for word as the unvarying decree of the Most High.  I disagree with you that God or His son would object to the marriage of two homosexuals who followed the teachings of Jesus on marriage; where their flesh becomes one, they are devoted to each other, and that they love each other as they love themselves.  Does He find THAT unholy?  Lastly, the Old Testament has some ridiculous inapplicable laws, as I demonstrated in previous posts.  However, the New Testament is not clean of some socially questionable direction as well.  The book of Ephesians says "the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior".  Does this condemn all Christian wives to a life of servitude?  Certainly, with the influence of the Feminine Mystique (this IS a history blog after all), huge amounts of women have become significant breadwinners in the household, is this What Jesus Would have them Do?  I hope I have presented my ideas clearly.  For future reference, marriage is spelled as so, not marrAIge.  God Bless and good night.  Love Rob

      You are certainly welcome Natalya. I'm glad you read what I had to say.  For me, I never trust numbers unless I know the source in which those numbers come from. Who was surveyed? What questions were asked in regards to the survey? There are a lot of ways numbers can be manipulated, which, as a result, can sway the data in a way that supports an idea. I rarely rely on percentages, ratios and what-not unless I know how the data was brought up. For example, I saw on the back of a bus in Portland the other day that read on the rear "249 cars are at home because I am on the road". How do I know they didn't make up the number? Most people who ride the bus don't even own a car! So, by counting the number of people who ride the bus everyday for reliance on the accurancy of that particular data isn't gonna cut it. That is the type of BS statistic that makes me question every form of data I hear, unless I know what the source is. So NPR is going to need to present their resources for their data before I trust what they say.  I have to ask Nat, how is it that you are somewhat religious, but don't even know if religious is real? Interesting. In regards to the bible, those who believe in the judeo-christian religion go by the New Testament, the place where Jesus's teachings are, which is the place where the religion originated. The New Testament is the place where Jesus speaks of homosexuality. And don't call people hypocrites because they don't fast or don't follow the Ten commandments strictly. That is part of the Old Testament. And it seems to me that you think that fasting and ten commandments stuff is all you think the Christian religion is. It seems to me that you're taking the standpoint of christianity very objectively, in which you think that we point fingers at the gay marriage issue and say "you're sinning! you're sinning!". We all know people sin. People who "go by the bible" sin. The Pope has sinned! What I'm saying is, is that as a christian, in regards to the Gay Marriage issue, we're not pointing fingers as to who's a sinner for being gay. It's the fact that those who support gay marraige are trying to take the sacred, holy idea of marraige and turn it into an unholy union. And yes, you may quote me on this is if anyone wants to respond.

      The Tony Awards are tonight at eight! I'm going to watch, I'm excited. Another thing that I'm excited about is amazingly senior project. I really like my topic and I can't wait to do my project. I think Mrs. VA was right when she said that you should do something that is meaningful to you.  OK, college Portfolio questions... It says we need to apply to at least three scholarships. I don't know about other people but I'm having a hard time finding scholarships. All the ones that I want to do the deadlines have already passed. Can we use them for the project even if the deadline has passed? Finally, I saw the Skyview band in the Starlight Parade on TV. It was cool, great job you guys!

      I am not sure if anyone has heard, but former President Ronald Reagan died today from pneumonia due to his Alzheimers disease. I was watching a tribute to him on TV today and learned more about his life than what I learned about his political career from the history books. He was the oldest president to be elected at 69. He also lived longer than any other president. He died at the age of 93 in his home. I guess I never actually realized the major impact that he had on America until I watched his tribute. He was able to bring hope to Americans and bring them to an age that they were able to be happy. I never really knew about him until this year, but I wish that I could have experienced and seen his great presidency in action. It is funny, though, that I never really wanted to learn a whole lot about him, but after his death, he seems intriguing and somewhat of a legend, which makes me want to know more about him and his life. I hope that everyone will at least give there respects to the man who gave so much to our country.

      Yeah Julie for our VA's english classes, there is an AP FEST/PARTY on June 10th from 5:30 to 7:00. We have a committee planning that party and I'm not sure whether those planning people have coordinated the party to include the US history students too.  On the other hand, we have to do something special just for Ms.Clark....Maybe everyone has to sign and write a message on a card or something....As a farewell to all the dedications and years of work she has contributed to Skyview. So maybe we should have a special US history party on a different date.  In the mean time, I have to find those AP FEST committee members........

      Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy everybody. I agree global warming is serious and the open use of chlouroflouro carbons which is a large addition to the problem should be regulated in third world countries. About the movie "The Day after tomorrow"; I went into the movie expecting it to be concerning the effects of global warming but really they just threw watchers some bs about the North Atlantic current shifting and heating things up. They did not address the common problems in the world today that cause global warming. All in all the movie had good special effects and it was cool to see mother nature wreck havoc. Anyway I hope you all have a great weekend.   Chris

      Has anyone seen the new movie The Day After Tomorrow?  I heard it's about the effects of global warming and should be pretty good.  Maybe seeing the moive will motovate some people to help improve conditions before they worsen.  However there will always be people who could care less about the future and do not desire to sell their gas guzzling polution contributing monster vehicles.  Any ways, think about the many ways we can individually contribute to improving our damaged environment and do one thing different for the sake of future generations.  PS: Thanks Thomas for changing the blogger set-up.  It makes it easier to see when I've posted because I forget between my other classes.

      Thank you Mary for providing some good opinion to respond to. As I was reading your post I found my self disagreeing with a couple of statements you made so I had to respond. I just don't see how you can say "I want to take down the idea that right-winged, conservatives aren't open people. DOn't believe that stereotype," when you yourself blatantly state: " Students who are viewed to be the smart ones are viewed that way... because they're left-winged/secularists who use data up the ying-yang to prove their point." Isn't that a major stereotype you just have created yourself? It seems as if you call all the "smart" people boot-lickers who side with the side that their liberal teachers take, that we are not guided by morals in our arguments but only by "data" and scientific experiments. I personally have very strong morals I comply with and I am somewhat religious (if there is such a thing) but I always prove my every argument with "imperical data" just because that's the info that can not be made up and can not be proven wrong or considered opinionated; numbers do not swing either liberal or conservative, they are neutral. What you say about writing papers that teachers like I also consider to be very argumentative, and it of course depends on the school you go to, but the majority of teachers I am sure would prefer you to write a paper that is original in idea and content and shows you to be open-minded thinker.  About abortion, it's great that you have that kind of sense of responsibility for your actions, and I think it's partly because you know that that won't ever happen to you, but we have to remember about all the people that simply do not have that kind of education/surrounding atmosphere/family to support them when they are faced with that kind of choice of either having a child and giving up their future or seeing a doctor for a couple hours and killing that precious spark of life. I still don't know what I would exactly do myself, but I would probably side with you. However I am very strongly for abortion for those who NEED it, or who believe they do.  GM: I don't know how you can tell a gay person that he/she wasn't even "intended" to be alive on this earth, just because it says in the Bible that God did not include gays in his original design. I read the Bible many times and I totally agree with Rob that if we do not follow everything there is written in it, like fasting and strictly following the ten commandments, then why should we tell other people that they don't have the right to marry just because it says so in the Bible. I really think there shouldn't even be such an issue. I want to reference slavery in what Jefferson wrote about the exclusion of Black people from the constitutional definition of "men" just based on the reasoning that Afr. Amer. are "a different species," thus degrading "a whole race of men from the rank in the scale of being which THEIR(?) Creator may perhaps have given them." Maybe gays should be excluded from the ranks of "men"?, they are sort of a different species too...  "We are at war... with terrorism ... racism ... but most of all we are at war with ourselves."

      I too find the impacts of global warming to be frightening.  I dont know how people still deny that it is a real threat.  If anyone wants more information on the topic, check out http://www.ucsusa.org/global_environment/archive/page.cfm?pageID=520  It has a summary of the IPPC's (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) findings in a recent study.  It also has a link to the origenal report.  I found it to be very informative.  ~Joseph

      Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property).   But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then).   Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!!  I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints.   THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!!  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING!  And finally, do we have an end of year AP Party/Farewell to Ms.CLark Party soon?

      Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot.  I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students— and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit.  There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option.  In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November.  It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school; a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own.  With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept.  What does everyone think?  I want comments from both students and their parents on this one.  But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone.  (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).  Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate?  Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this.  May democracy live long and prosper.  Love Rob  P.S.  Create Blogger profiles.  They are kinda fun to do, and they give ME something to look at when I'm up insomniacing.

      Preface:  I know GM is a horse that died a long time ago and we continue to beat it, and for that I apologize, but having just bought a pair of Birkenstocks combined with defense of my weekle Bush mocking, I feel a little offended at Mary's harsh criticism of scientific thinkers.   Mary, I'm not sure I get your stance on gay marriage.  You say you're morally against abortion but you think it should be legal.  Do you have the same position on GM?  I found the arguments you made a little contradictory.    First I want to say that I understand you respect everyone's right to an opinion, that is what you intended isn't it?  But for someone who doesn't want to come off as a right-wing bigot, you kind a come off as a right wing bigot when you challenge "left-wing secularists" who don't reference their morals for forming logical platforms based on fact.  I understand there is a fine line to walk between faith and fact, but I don't think a person has to choose one or the other.  The "smarter people" you refer to have a right to desire evidence to support the belief that God didn't intend homosexual's to marry.  If that evidence comes from the Bible, that is fine, but I guess what I'd like is some flexibility in one's "morals."  I, Left-wing Secularist, read your post and find myself questioning some of your statements you credit to your morality.  I, Left-wing Secularist, would like to know WHY you feel how you feel, where your morals come from, because I feel that I have evidence and "imperical data" to contest the morals you base your argument on.  And I, Left-wing Secularist, feel that I have analiable justification to disregard baseless morals if they don't coincide with mine.  With that said, can you satisfy my curiosity as to why you believe homosexuality is immoral?  I have my own theories, some of which I have expressed, but in the interest of originality, I'll only provide them upon your request.  Long story short, my biggest problem with the argument that homosexuality is immoral (whether right or wrong) is that it means homosexuality is WRONG and homosexuals are WRONG, spawning an attitude that is anti-homosexual which punishes those who had homosexuality thrust upon them whether by biology or development (there are studies that make strong cases for both).  Is that fair?  You say God didn't intend homosexuals to marry, then why were the created?  To be deliberately persecuted by faithful Christians?  Did God intend addiction, physical disability or car accidents?  I don't think that they were spontaneous developments while His holiness stood idly by.  I don't want to question your ideology, maybe just some minor parts, but it's only because I have imperical data from the holiest of books to back me up.  Post on the blog, e-mail me, or talk to me about it because I think it's an important discussion, but know that like Jesus, I'll always love you.  That goes for everyone  Love, Rob  P.S.  Clark's in Atlanta (I don't know why) then Seattle to prep for the next step in her career.  P.P.S  I only pay $6.25 for movies, where the hell is Frank going?

      Global warming is a serious threat and I, like Bethany, am glad to see a new subject on the blog. The amount of damage humans have done, do, and will continue to do to the earth always amazes me. It seems that humans are extremely selfish. If humans continue to plague the earth with pollutants at this rate, it will inevitably lead to destruction of the Earth or the human race, whether it be from depletion of ozone or the melting of the icecaps. It sickens me that although we know this information we continue to pollute and plague the earth.  I also saw the movie Day After Tomorrow and was somewhat dissapointed but it was still an okay movie. I have never really liked Dennis Quaid (I think that is how you spell it), I think he wasn't good for the part. Anyway it's worth the 7.50 to see it. Mr. Parlee is a good teacher. He is very opinionated but, as Ryan and I were talking, we found it somewhat refreshing to hear actual political opinions by someone as educated in history and politics as he is. Usually teachers are hesitant about revealing their opinions because they don't want to offend anyone, but because Mr. Parlee is a substitute he is able to cross those boundries.  Lastly, does anyone know where Clark went? She told us but I forgot.

      Rob, thank you for bringing up a different topic!  It was getting really repetitive in here!  I think that global warming is a really important topic that doesn't get enough credit.  Again, thanks to "the man" for leaving it alone and letting people forget that it does exist and could cause major problems in the future.    One of the issues is that scientists aren't getting funds to research plausible effects of the increase in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, which has definitely increased over the last twenty years or so.  Just for everyone's knowledge, the movie "The Day After Tomorrow" is pretty much bogus, in terms of the causes of global warming.  The idea that the actual warming of the world would be immediately followed by a global ice age is pretty unrealistic.  But as long as it reminds people of global warming and the problems that it could eventually create, then I'm all for it!But, anyways, not enough of "the governments" money goes into research for global warming and, while the process is irreversible, it would be worthwhile to research how we could slow down the process that we're now heavily involved in.  However, although the issue seems like it would be pretty un-controversial, there are many scientists who actually believe that global warming is not something that humans cause, that it is simply part of the world turning and getting older.    In the last century on the earth's surface (keep in mind that this is on the ground, not in the actual atmosphere), there have been increases of at three degrees Fahrenheit, which may not sound like much, but it's caused the sea level to rise from six inches to about three feet.  Of course the increase in sea level is caused by ice sheets melting from the increase in temperature.  It's all relevant!!!  And, if these changes had taken place over the last thousand years, it really wouldn't be that big of a deal.  Wow, the earth changes....what a concept!  But the fact that over only 100 years so many changes have taken place...well, it's worth getting into.  You guys, please respond to this one.  It's important, and we need to move on from the gay marriage and abortion topics.  I think that everyone has said what needs to be said, and it's time for something else.  Later!  Bethany

      Hey students...I am settling in and have already started working.  Next week is my third week at Shorecrest.  I hope everyone is having a relaxing summer but I hope you are still all thinking and learning...there is no evidence of this by looking at our blog...did anyone see Farenheit 9-11...?  My new email address is stephanie.clark@shorelineschools.org.  I would love to hear how you did on the AP test.  Remember it is a difficult test and set up so  only 50% of the students paww with a three or better.  In addition only 8% GET A 5.  Also remember only the top scholars in the nation choose to take these tests...so pat yourself on the back for your effort and the amount you learned despite your score or regroup for a better effort next year.   For those of you who did well  and I am sure some of you did congratulations.  Rob-how is the ASB retreat going?  Enjoy the rest of your summer and I hope to hear from some of you.

      I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses.  And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.  I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.  Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!  Thomas Chen

       Thomas, thanks for re-sending the invitation... I'm doing a poem, not sure if I'm gonna do Robert Frost, though.  He doesn't really have a particular style.  Some poems he does 10 syllables per line, some 9, some 7, etc...  But then, I could just combine elements of all of his poems...  If I was doing one of the essays, though, I would do the Robert Frost one.  It seems easier than all of the rest.

       To me it seems like Whitman's going on a "poetic rant" of sorts on his thoughts of life, love, happiness, etc.  He's not necessarily praising himself as much as he's just praising his life in general.

       I have to say that I'm not as interested in reading Night because I read it in eighth grade and it is a very emotional book that I would prefer to read once only because it is so sad.  However since it seems curriculum here is different and students here haven't yet read it, I suppose that's unfair of me.  I'll read it again if I have to.

            -Hello AP English, this is Ryan Elliott and I'm a rookie to Blogger.com.       I recall reading Night freshman year in Mrs. Micheel's English class, and the impression the story left on me brings to mind the narratives of Fredderick Douglas and Harriet Jacobs.  The accounts of the Holocaust enable the reader to experience the horror firsthand, and each individual number in the death totals suddenly forms a face.  At the beginning of the year I remember Mrs. VA stressing the importance of showing and not telling in writing, and I feel in many cases that history can tell a story, but it takes a first person account like Night or the narratives of Douglas and Jacobs to show the reader a story and make them live it.  Considering the current study of World War II in AP History, I think Night would be an excellent compliment.        The present study of World War II with Ms. Clark has made me feel disappointed in American diplomacy because of the decision to drop atom bombs on two Japanese cities.  When encountering the situation, I pretended I was a soldier in WWII, and I tried to think of how I would have felt about our actions.  Not only am I shocked at the civilian aimed tactics implemented globally during the war, but also I am troubled by America's decision to take part.  Personally, I would have difficulty enlisting in the military because of the possibility that I could be asked to carry out a mission like the one presented to Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay.  I believe war is a conflict between armed military soldiers, and does not involve intentional civilian casualties.  In today's military this death count is accounted for by the term collateral damage, which masks its true definition probably for the morale of soldiers and the maintenance public relations.  I can't imagine I would feel at peace pledging allegiance to a nation who was engaging in civilian warfare.  I love my country and would no doubt serve if conscripted; however, I feel the line in the pledge of allegiance, "with liberty and justice for all" extends to all people of the world, and that the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were injustices to the Japanese people.       I believe pledging allegiance to the United States of America means promising one's devotion to preserve the liberty and justice of our nation while attempting to extend the basic courtesies to all who we come in contact with.  The invisible borders separating the people of the world are self created illusions, much like the concept of racial differences, that do nothing to obscure the sanctity of democratic rights or our responsibility to uphold them.

       YES I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED! To me, historical literature are especially fun to read, especially when it compliments with what we are studying in history. And the holocaust is certainly a dramatic period of history and literture that would sprout out many ideas about morality, wars, politics and the whole theme of race and injustices. I may not be able to speak for the whole class, but it's certainly a great topic to discuss and read about! I'm sure Tristan would be interested in it too! :)  And well, since Rob, you've started the pledge of allegiance debate, I have already posted a huge long post about the pledge in the history blog, but I think it's relevant for me to post my argument on this blog too because it touches on the issue of individualism and what is to be an American (the whole themes we've studied all year).  And don't blame me for writing about this thing for so long, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations.   As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the "Under God" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about.....  What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards.   And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear.  What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the "majority" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good).   Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber.   And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists.   And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others.  Differences of opinions is good!  Thomas Chen

       Hmmm...I'm starting to think ahead to curriculum after spring break, when we will have time to read another book and also to prepare for the AP exam.  I know from talking with Miss  Clark that her classes have recently been spending time studying the Holocaust, and I'm thinking about Kailie's expression of frustration.  Why didn't Jim just run?  A similar question is often, "Why didn't the Jews just band together and keep the Nazis from treating them so poorly."  I'm wondering...are you folks interested in reading a first-hand account of Auschwitz after break?  The book I'm thinking of is Night, written beautifully by Elie Wiesel.  It's a quick read, but it's also a hard read because of the subject matter.  It isn't American lit (Wiesel was Romanian, I believe), but that doesn't really matter for the test.  What do you all think?  Would it be best to be presented with a variety of options before deciding?  As for your question about the Pledge of Allegiance, Rob...I find myself asking many more questions in addition to the one about the "under God" phrase.  For example, what does it mean to pledge allegiance to a flag at a time when patriotism is so integrated with war-making?  I cannot help but remember photos I've seen of Nazi swastika flags hanging over church altars during World War II.  As a religious person, I want to see a full separation of church and state so that I am left to practice my faith as I see fit.  I believe others have that right, too.  Although I believe that we exist by the grace of God, not everyone does.    So what does our flag stand for?  When we pledge allegiance to it, what are we promising to do or not do?  What is the role of God in a pluralistic country?  What binds us together as a people, particularly as we become a more diverse society every year?  Does pledging allegiance mean committing ourselves to creative peace-making, or only that we will pick up arms if attacked?  And what about "justice for all"?  These are the questions I ask myself every day at the beginning of third period.  What do you all think? Mrs. V-A

       First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please.  It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different?  I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid.  The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge.  I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them.  To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state.  Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it.  One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology.  Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please.  With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs.  The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones.  As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country.  For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life.  Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so.  My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me!  If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short!  Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break?  Because they all spark my interest.  Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning.  Love,  Rob

       In response to Kailie, I think your point about how Jim's not afraid of enduring through all of these ridiculous rituals imposed by Tom (If I interpreted you correctly), illustrates Jim's complex charactor and heroic quality. Jim, as a slave, probably has a really low self-esteem and he comes from the world where slaves have to listen to whites for every little nuts and bolts. Of course Jim did not know he was free, (any slave would think it's a miracle if somebody proclaimed they were free). So he just thought "this is the way everything is done, because Tom said so".  Even though he has the brain to mention it's a ridiculous idea like making up a coat of arm, but he still follows the order, because who knows what will happen to him if a slave doesnt obey a white man's order.  But I understand where you come from. I also felt very weird these things were happening, but lots of weird things happen back then, a lot of things today would consider very very sick and unbearble......So in trusting Twain's realism style of writing, I have to just interpret what I can about the society from Twain's words.

       I was really frustrated when reading the end of the book when Tom and Huck were "rescuing" Jim. I couldn't help but get past the idea that, if Jim were really worried about getting away from slavery and afraid for his life, he wouldn't jump through all the hoops for Tom's perfect scheme. I felt it was a little unrealistic; it's natural instinct to run when given the chance -- just like if a dog were to get free, he wouldn't sit around and wait for the perfect getaway. He'd just get out of there! Did anyone else feel anxious while reading this part in the book, or is it just me?

       Knowing what Jim had to go through and then at the end for him to just give it all up for the sake of Tom, proves Jim to be the more significant hero.  Throughout their whole journey Jim was always worried about Huck and concentrated on his friendship with Huck.  Whenever they were separted Jim would search forever for Huck until he found where he was.  They always ended up reuniting due mostly to Jim's love for Huck.  Not until the end of the book did Huck ever truly try to find Jim.  However at the end of the book Huck's love for Jim became more prevelant. Although Huck knew better than to do all the crazy things that Tom insisted they do in order to free Jim, somehow Huck's love for Jim was submissive to Tom's influence over Huck.  After trying so hard to escape to freedom then putting up with Tom's ideas of freeing a slave, Jim was still willing to risk it all for the sake of saving Tom.  This is what a true hero is.  Huck didn't have anything to lose, if people found out he had been trying to free a slave they would send him back to the widow's house and people would just think "that poor boy needs to be civilized." However for Jim, he had everything to lose, and he was willing to lose everything for Tom, who wasn't even a true friend to Jim.

       While both Huck and Jim can be seen as heroes, Jim is the more siginificant hero of the two because of not only the racism he faces by being a slave, but because he can overcome this racism by saving Tom in the end of the book.  In Tom's cruel and "adventurous" plan to help Jim escape to freedom puts Jim in a place where he is locked in a cabin, when he could be free.  Jim doesn't object to this plan because he figures that Tom is white and thus knows what he is doing.  After putting Jim through a month of being locked up, Tom does manage to help Jim escape.(even though Tom is shot in the leg)  This is the point that seperates Jim's heroism from Huck's.....Jim throws away the freedom that he has endured a month's "cabin fever" for to save Tom that has just put him through this month of isolation.

       In my opinion, Huck and Jim are both heros in this novel.  Huck is a hero in a sense that he decides to go to hell to save Jim, which was a huge decision to make at such a time in the South.  Later in the novel, Jim becomes the hero when he sacrifices his freedom (or so he thinks), the freedom that Huck has worked to protect, to save Tom's life.  Both Huck and Jim have their heroic moments by making huge moral decisions.  They both have to decide whether or not to do the right thing, and the fact that they both end up doing what's right makes them both heros.  Sorry, that made no sense...talking about stuff like this confuses me sometimes; I know what I want to say, but it just doesn't come out right!

       Hey guys, you can add one more to the total # of bloggers, making 19 i think?  Anyway, addressing Tom's point from the essay that Twain was writing for a racist audience doesn't sit well with me.  I'm not disagreeing that there were (and still are) many racists in this country, and probably some of them were fans of the original, Tom Sawyer, but I just don't get the feeling Twain wrote for an audience.  He was already a very successful author who had stopped needing to write for money, so I don't think the bottom line was his issue.  Every example of Twain's writing I've come across challenges cultural norms.  Whether addressing Christianity, poverty, or racism, he attacks each issue with the underestimated weapon of satire.  Flooding the tongue-in-cheek essays and novels with his own opinions, no matter how controversial.  I don't believe that Twain could be writing for a racist audience while openly attacking the Ku Klux Klan, and the entire establishment of Christianity.  If Twain avoided openly expressing Huck's love for Jim to the world, it was to get around his own nagging imperfections in his relations with blacks.  I don't believe that this was as much of a concious effort as Miss Morison claims.  Sometimes things are better off left to the imagination, e.g. the "humbles himself to a nigger" sentence is much more effective in my eyes than, "I'm sorry Jim, I didn't mean to worry you."  Lastly, although Morison's essay was very well articulated and worthy of consideration, it was very much speculation, just as I am writing now. I look forward to posting often and lengthily in this blog, so you've been warned.  By the way, the appeal to the removing "under god" from the pledge of allegiance began this week.  I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on that, as well as on Huck and the recent essay.  Love, Rob

       Hello!  My assumption is that extra credit will motivate many of you to access this site this weekend, so I thought I would throw out some questions we didn't have time for in class.    Who is the hero of the novel?  Huck or Jim?  What are the most significant themes from the book that affected you personally?    What about Toni Morrison's question:  "Yet the larger question, the danger that sifts fr om the novel's last page, si whether Huck, minus Jim, will be able to stay those three monsters as he enters the 'territory.'  Will that undefined space, so falsely imagined as "open," be free of social chaos, personal morbidity, and further moral complications embedded in adulthood and citizenship?  Will it be free not only of nightmare fathers but of dream fathers too?"  Have fun!  Remember to study for Monday's test.   :-)  Mrs. V-A

       HA....What I found so interested while reading through this essay was the fact that even tho Mark Twain might be a staunch abolitionists....For racial equality during that time period........But he also has to sell the book, make the book noteworthy.....And so Twain has to insert a lot of audience-awareness into his novel.......And since he knows a lot of the readers at the time are rascists......Therefore he makes Huck sometimes very uneasy to comment how good Jim is......Even tho Huck probably knows deep inside that Jim is a very good person......But he fails to admit it to anybody else........Even fail to admit fully to Jim and himself Huck's true feelings.  And of course Twain probably didn't know the future status of blacks/slaves, and all is very uncertain........So he had no choice but to retain some of the old stereotypical qualities.........Only today can we see it from an objective point of view.

       Don't blame me everyone..........but i've just thought of a great idea to implement for this blog......There are those "Open-ended" free response questions in the AP English exam (usually one a year), that has an open prompt and one has to write a mini expository essay about it, from your own experience.  And last year's was:   urlLink  "entertainment has the capacity to ruin society"  , defend, challenge, or qualify this assertion. Soooooooooo any cool ideas/agree/dissagree viewpoints on this statement.

       It was an astounding discussion today! I'm surprised at our third period class today, we actually did some genuine discussions! Without more than five minutes of silent stares at each other! That's a huge benchmark for us. LOL.   Ok Nova, we may have a different stance on this issue about the discussion of "racism". I think the controversy of it is really really interesting, and really relevant to the society we live in today. Maybe whining about it doesn't help, and only makes the matter worse. But one has to study the history behind racism, the history behind slavery, and study the current society in general to get all these controversies and see that these debates are very interesting. If we are living in a place like Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, San Francisco, or Atlanta, we might see the issue and controversies surrounding the issues of race and racism in a very different way, because the societies of these urban centers are so polygot that you CANNOT ignore the issue of race at all. And it becomes so relevant to your everyday lives, whether you like it or not. So I don't think we can make a judgement on how the issue of "racism" is sooooo out of date and dumb now. To a lot of people, it's very relevant to their lives. And reading this book Huck Finn I'm sure will help us understand better the deep history behind slavery, race relationships between whites and blacks, that still influences our thinkings today. And I agree with today's discussion just banning the N word will not solve any any racial problem at all, not even down to the scale of molecules. There are a lot of other forms of racial discriminatory actions that we can not ban because of free speech issue such as Erin's description of all the confederate flags in the south still. And for christ's sake it's a piece of literature, one of the best pieces of American lit every written. And to the issue of calling people "whites", "blacks", "African Americans" whatever, I agree with the discussions today that it's a matter of respect. Some people maybe offended by calling "black", others maybe "African Americans", so it. But I agree that in general, we just have to see all people as one group of Americans, and not place any body into a race or cultural profile. --------- So, what do you think of that?

       The entire racism argument makes me mad.  Do people not get that Twain was anti-racist?  That he was trying to make a statement with Huck Finn?  And also, the "n-word" was used back then, and it was the common word for black people.  Making all the poor white people of the south talk in a more socially polite way would have been defeating a major point of the book, realism.  100 years from now, what if "black" is not politically correct?  Will they ban all the books written in present day, to censor "bad words"?  These people make me so mad!!!

       I think the people who are against this book for its portrayl of blacks need to look at how it shows whites. It shows cruel whites, white drunks, white racists, whites who steal, lie, cheat... so how does Mark Twain show black people in a negative light, when the majority of his criticisms are demonstrated through his white characters?

       I think we should have a discussion on Huck Finn and the controversy, it seems very interesting. I read this particular interesting thing in the passage that implied you need to be a "good teacher" , to actually use all the positive aspects of Huck Finn and teach more about the truth of slavery. One needs to teach Huck Finn in conjuction to the historical period behind it. An "insensitive teacher" may allow the racial impacts the word has on the students in the classroom goes unchecked, and allow students to "read aloud" in the classrooms.  But "on the contrary, studies have shown that, in the hands of a good teacher, the novel can actually have a positive impact on racial attitudes and increase in interracial understanding. I agree with the fact that if you don't see the true picture of that period in history, to see the life of a "common man", and use the language they use back then, one can not grasp a true concept of. And of course all of this have to be carefully studied in conjuction to a great understanding of the history of slavery and slave trading. That's why having the book in elementary and middle school is probably not a good idea. Because the kids then can't get ironies, satires, and the historical behind why Twain wrote this book and used the bad words to portrait the truth.

       Well, I would have gotten the first question right...  Anyway, Natalya, Tom suggested I talk to you about taking his place in the district MUN coming up in May.  I have the basic understanding of what goes on, but if you would like me to join you, you can e-mail at attakid117@attbi.com or call me at 574-1916 with info (specifically what I would need to do to prepare).

       Sorry, but I had to post this poem I found in one of the practice tests I have been taking. I really like this test because of the fact that a lot of the experts that they give for analysis are actually really interesting to interpret and are great works of literature:  Virtue George Herbert (1593-1633)  Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,      The bridal of the earth and sky; The dew shall weep thy fall tonight;      For thou must dies. Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,      Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave,      And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,     A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your closes,     And all must die. Only a sweet and virtuous soul,     Like seasoned timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal,     Then chiefly lives.   Just a couple of questions for practice:)  The subject of the poem is: a) mortality, b) immortality, c) the beauty of nature, d) the impact of evil,      e) the essence of goodness.  The speaker conceives of the world as: a) ending in ashes, b) repeating the cycle of birth and death,       c) having the strength of "seasoned timber," d) eternal, e) being the secure dwelling of humanity  I am looking forward to frisbee tomorrow; I have to agree with Frank that sometimes it is just better to simply relax and take your mind off all the fidgeting and worries. By the way the answers to the questions are: e and c.

       All this death and gloom over the AP test, we all need some happiness... Well, okay, i'm no good at being happy, so here is some dark sarcasm. Good enough?   Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On'  WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.  Props to the Onion for that little piece. My two cents on the AP test?    AHHHHH. Now, were did all those grammar/rhetorical thingy lists go to?  --Beck--

       I just took the collegeboard test and I have to agree that it is much, much easier than the one we took in class, at least my score went up by 10 points:) I agree that literary terms are crucial to know both for mult. choice and essays, but grammer is also really important, they have a few questions like:  lines ... contain which of the following?: a) elaborate metaphor b) parallel syntax c) a single periodic sentence d) a compound subject e) subordinate clauses I am currently looking through all the grammer packets Mrs. VA gave us in the beginning of the year. Yeah, I am kind of starting to feel a bit nervous already.  P.S. The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft intered with their bones. (not sure if that's how it goes:)

       Friends, English Classmen, lend me your ears.  It is true what you say... the test is subjective, subtle, and DIFFICULT.  But you are more prepared than you think.  By now we can all write 9-caliber essays with the right inspiration, and the multiple choice is less perilous than you give it credit for.  The tests we've taken from the books are meant to trick you- beat you on a technicality and so forth.  So much so that the objective (I hope) is to get you to read the questions so closely, you don't get fooled on the test.  However, there is evidence for hope.  The test that I gave a link to in my last post, was a sample test written by the college board... after a 50% on the Peterson's test, I got an 80% on the real one... that's a huge improvement.  It's also great for confidence.  We can do this, class!!!  The best advice I can give is to know the literary terms like the back of your hand... what they are, how they're used, and how you can recognize them in a passage.  That's the heart of these questions, and if you can identify those terms, you will have success.  Love, Rob

       My only suggestion to those who want to "study" for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time.   I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays.   So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms.  My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word "object" (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that "dispute" and "argue" are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.

       To be perfectly honest, i dont really see how you can study for the AP test. I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed. Be confident in the knowledge you already have; we've all been preparing for this since the first day we signed up for AP -- just do you best. For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over!  Kailie

       I have to disagree Thomas.  The AP English test is definitely tough, but I don't think its the toughest.  While a lot of the multiple choice questions are subjective, the essays make up for it.  If you write good strong essays and support your points, you should (hopefully!) do well.  I think people just find the test to be hard because its not something you can memorize out of a book; its skills for recognizing rhetorical strategies and writing well that count.

       Ok maybe it's just me, but I would rank AP English tests the hardest tests.   The multiple choice questions on the AP English tests are harder than SAT passages (which i already did horribily), not only are we suppose to know the meanings of the passage, but exactly and thoroughly understand how authors wrote it and carefully constructed the passages.  There are several reasons for this ranking that puts English on the APEX of all AP tests:  1: The questions are the most subjective: Everytime when I take the AP English multiple choice tests, for every MC, I feel my hands sweat and my mind full of doubt when I bubble in an answer for that question. There is NEVER a single question that I can feel 100% confident on that I'm sure I got it right. Unlike all other subjects, including US history, where there is just some straightfoward concrete fact that's either right or wrong.  The meaning of every excerpt, sentence, even to the every word of the question can be interpreted in a variety of different ways. And as Chad mentioned today in class, that we are taught so much about how to infer, imply, that we sometimes forget the LITERAL MEANINGS, and we lose perspectives. In short, every question we can "Overthink" it.  And again being the subject of English, there is no fine line as to where is "overthinking", and where is "underthinking". To a point, it gets to be rather annoying, all the shakiness and uncertaintiness in answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION.  2: When you get an answer wrong, and you read the explanations that explains why, you are never ever 100% convinced. There is always that self-righteous factor that comes to play that doubts the correct answers, simply because words and phrases can be interpreted differently in everybody's minds. Everytime I feel the urge to argue with whoever thought the right answer to a question is this letter, while two other letter of answers can probably be interpreted as correct.   3: For almost every other school subject, the teacher, the student, if he or she is willing to learn or improve, can easily identify the weak areas, which FACTS the student's missing and so on after some assessments......But for English, I just  know I'm not prepared for the test, and I know did bad on the practice ones, but still there is not some concrete evidences I can point out that here, this is my weak area, or this I really do not understand. So it becomes a matter of trial and error and practice, which seems limitless and endless.   And Finally, this is the most unique about the English test that's different than EVERY OTHER SUBJECT: ---- YOU CAN NOT CRAM AND STUDY FOR . Yeah it is right that after maybe several, maybe several dozens years of intense study.....You maybe say I'm fully prepared now for the AP english exam........And still the questions bombards you with subjectivity. And just the shear size of the vocabulary, the subtle difference between all the synonymous words, (overstatement, hyperbolie, implies, infers, suggests, what is the intent, argue, dispute...). And it's like your whole life of culture and experience in the world culminates and contributes to your performance on this test. Yeah for a really really stressed, miserably failing, troubled, an extremely unprepared and uncertained kid one weekend before he has to take the AP English language test, This test is just not the test to cram for.  All in all, AP English test in my feeling is just hard.......harder than every other test.   Unless you are Matt Wu of course.  I don't know if any of you share any of the feelings I listed above.   So there is my emotional turmoil of the day.  Thanks all to all of you who were willing to read this. Thomas Chen

       Hey, for those of you feeling stressed about the AP test next Monday as a result of some negative test scores on the Peterson's practice we took, there is a College Board written practice at   http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_englang.html  You may have to download a new Acrobat reader, but this should be a slightly more accurate prediction of your success than the Devil's own instrument of torture; The Peterson Test.  Good luck to everyone on this practice test, remember to take it within the alotted time, it is good practice!  Love Rob

       Thomas, I totally agree with you that standardized tests are simply unfair/wrong since individuals are not standard. It seems like in America everything is about individuality and ability to strive and achieve, yet society still places standards upon us that we have to pass in order to be "good citizens." I'm myself very frustrated with SATs and ACTs cause no matter if I am “super smart,” or get 1st places in competitions, I am just bad in analogies and my vocab doesn't include such words as vituperative, or flabbergasted. I personally just came from the WASMUN competition where I was elected Best Negotiator, and Rapatour (I don't know how to spell that) and spoke in front of 600 "delegates," and yet all of that doesn't matter cause I still feel "not good enough" cause my awesome SAT scores place me into the "average/standard" herd of students.  Actually I think it's an awesome idea to encourage our fellow students to participate in conversations by addressing them directly, it really does work... sometimes. In our "committees" in MUN (yeah, I am a nerd like that) we can just say "I yield my time to ...." and name a delegate that seems to be the least awake; it mostly ends up that he/she has a lot to say and starts participating in the debate, or else you at least you wake them up… for a while:)   About the practice AP test we took, I find it to be the best preparation for the test we can get. I just want to know what I would actually have gotten if it was the real test. I found mult. choice test to be the hardest part of it (stand. tests), the essays were fine. The prompt about Emerson was interesting, especially since we have studied him and read his works; I didn't focus as much on conventions, except for the usage of simple/complex sentences and the "..." to communicate effectively. Shakespeare essay was awesome cause I just have read a lot of him and the prompt was pretty broad and open for interpretation. It helps a lot to have background info about prompts. Now I think we should just really focus on reviewing the literary terms and grammar, I have problems coming up with literary terms, and also some of the mult. choice questions on grammar need review. I think our class is well prepared, we all read and write a lot, and Mrs. VA covered grammar/terms pretty well.

       I feel this is a great article that everybody should read:  urlLink   Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v. Board decision  It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology.  I would like to hear everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue.  Thomas Chen

       Mrs. VA,  I think trying to get more people involved in the discussions is a good idea.  However, knowing what it's like to be one of the ones that is not easily motivated to state my opinion during class, I feel that the best way would be to encourage the other students to try to bring the less responsive ones into the discussion.  Having a teacher pinpoint you in the middle of a discussion never seems to work too well. Throughout middle school and other classes many teachers have used that as a technique as a form of punishment for not paying attention, but for our class, many people are paying attention they just don't say as much.  Therefore if it's the other students it wont be as much of punishment, but should bring about more of a casual converstion which will allow everyone to feel more comfortable.

       As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43.  Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment.  On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go.  Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort.  The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated.  Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the "intellectuals"; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged.  Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion.  Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous.  There should never be a scenario where one must choose between "argue" and "dispute."  They're the same thing!!!  In history, the Fed either "raised interest rates" or "discouraged borrowing."  All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!!  Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests.  For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com.  Find the AP section, and we're taking AP Lang, not Lit, so be wary.  Once again, good luck on the test!  Love, Rob

       Mrs. VA, I absolutely agree that it's time to use some forceful means to rally everybody into sharing their ideas and speak up in class. That's actually a great idea actually of setting up a ground rule for everybody to speak, except that I'm not that kind of person who wants to jumpstart forcing other people to speak. But it would be nice for everybody in our class to finally break the "shyness" barrior.......after almost a whole year has gone by.  So for all you, please just start randomly question "Underrepresented" people "what do you think of this", or "what's your opinion on this issue".  I'm SURE everyone has great ideas to share, the "laziness", "uncertainty", and "shyness" are the only barriors.   In other news, third period would really like to know what was the highest grade on the English AP practice test multiple choice section in first period? Somehow almost every member of third period has a feeling that first period is "smarter" and engages in better discussions that us.   Don't be shy to share your comments now :)  Thomas Chen

       Hello!  I'm so pleased to see you all carrying on such a lively conversation; you're informed, you're responding to each other, and you're connecting all kinds of ideas and subjects.  Literature leads to culture, which leads to politics, which leads to a need to communicate civilly, which leads back to writing and literature.  Truly, you folks are the kinds of students teachers dream of when they first go into teaching.  I also appreciate your feedback about what is happening in class.  Concerning discussion...this has come up before.  Those of you who are participating feel like we are in a rut, as if you are dragging many unwilling--or unresponsive--bodies along with you.  Speakers and non-speakers become entrenched in their roles, and soon, class is predictable.  Boring.  So why have I allowed this?  Part of my role as a teacher is to facilitate, to push students to do what they would not be willing to do on their own.  I have a preferred style, though, that is based on respect of students' choices.  I find it very difficult to make a person speak if he or she is not willing.  Why?  Some people are painfully shy, and to be made to speak causes that student to suffer.  I would like class conversation to work like it does at a good dinner party, where people speak because they are interested and engaged.  I give all of you prep work, and I make the assumption that if you have done the work, you have the tools to speak.  And I expect you to be motivated enough--courageous enough--to conquer fear of a large room and state your opinion.  Perhaps this is idealistic of me, yet this is what democracy depends upon.    In the way we have a large group of silent people, our class is echoing a societal trend. Small numbers of people bother to get out and vote; small numbers of people in class participate in discussion.  What do we do?  I could be an autocrat and put people on the spot, giving "points" to those who have an anwer.  Is this the role of a teacher?  Is this what you want class to look like?  Feel like?  Do you want speaking aloud to be connected to rewards and punishments?  To take this analogy further, should we somehow punish people who choose to avoid their responsibilities as US citizens?  Dock their pay if they don't vote? The classroom is a special place, though.  It wasn't until extra credit was offered that any of you chose to participate in the blog.  So what to do? When leaders are organizing activities, one of the things they know to do is to invite specific individuals to participate in the group.  All of you who participate in this blog participate in class, also.  By speaking aloud, others will see you as class leaders.  If you want to maintain a democratic classroom, where students feel like equals and I am not treating you all as minions, what if you were to start inviting other students to respond?  Why should I be the one to ask questions, just because I am the teacher?  Don't you all ask questions of each other when you are in small groups? What if you start doing this in a large group?  Who do you want to hear from?  Ask that person a question, draw them in.  What kind of encouragement/lessons/announcements (if any) do you need from me to help you take a more active role in making discussion work?  I have been in classes before where one of the ground rules for discussion is that no one in the room may make more than 2 comments until everyone has been invited to share something with the large group.  We could do this if you'd like.  It can feel contrived; however, if you want to change the dynamic of class, this is a system that can help encourage change.    What do you think?  Mrs. V-A

       Yeah I can finally blog, Ryan I too am a rookie at this. It was so nice to go outside today instead of look at another essay. I feel that occasionally a break from strenuous study adds to your understanding of whatever your studying. I found this to be true when I was reading Thoreau (WOW that was a long time ago) and I practice this regularly. I don't know if that is a good or a bad habit. I wanted to test out the waters of blogging and I have, so Good Night!   ~ Frank

       I was dreading taking the practice AP english test all week, anticipating the worst possible three hours, or coming really close to having to take the french one.  However, after taking it today it wasn't as bad as I had thought. The multiple choice part wasn't too bad but I tend to take too much time reading and rereading... oh well.  The essays weren't extremely difficult either, and amazingly i finished all of them, even with a conclusion.  However the second one where we had to discuss how Emerson used the English language and conventions was a little more difficult.  Also, like it was said earlier, I noticed that Shakespeare was used and I found that to be odd considering he wasnt American, which is what we have been studying all year.

       There were a few obscurites in the multiple choice section..never felt overwhelmed though, and finished in plenty of time.  By the way, did anyone notice how I used an elipsis instead of transition words there?  Basically, that's how I responded to the Emerson prompt.  Picked one or two conventions that seemed blatantly obvious, and beat them till they died, then beat them some more.  I can't tell if I was too redundant or not, but the familiarity with the author DEFINITELY eased the pain.  It made reading the passage go much smoother, and I felt not bad about it overall.  I was suprised at the Shakespeare prompt because it was so vast and wide, not really what I'm used to.  It also suprised me that it asked for Shakespeare (which I remembered enough of to respond), because he's super old and not American.  Overall I feel confident (more so after some grammar review), but this will not be my most difficult test.  Good luck to everyone!  Love, Rob

       Hey, how did everyone think of that practice AP multiple choice/three essays practice test we took? how do you think you are prepared? Any comments/feelings/complaints/sorrows/anger/stress/suggestions/questions about the AP English test?  To me personally, the multiple choice section was harder than the free response section (Still a lot of interpretations, confusions, and ambiguities in the multiple choice answers). And within the free-response essays, i felt that the one about the English conventions/language was the hardest, although since the passage was about Emerson, the familiarity of the author kind of comforted me a little. It was weird talking about how Emerson persuades the reader his opinions with the use of "conventions", such things as grammar, the parts of English language that I tend to ignore its importance. Yeah so overall, that was a challenging piece to write as the essay prompt demanded "a well reasoned and organized essay".  But other than that, I liked the free-free response essay that we can draw on our own experiences, readings, and observations for that last essay. It wasn't so strict as to just interpret a small piece of passage..   Please do respond with your opinions on the AP english practice test.   Thomas Chen

       O Paul! I read the Da Vinci Code! It's a GREAT book. I recommend it to everyone. The different hidden symbols found in the artwork and the secret organization of the Priory of Sion is just so interesting. However if you do read it I recommend you go online and look at some of the paintings discussed in the book. This will give you a good visual of what's described in the book. It's very entertaining and it allows you to explore new ideas. It's also fun to try to solve the different puzzels throughout the book.

       About third period being soo quiet, I think it's almost become a routine that others don't notice or don't care anymore. I know some people are just lazy, and believe me, third period just seems to drag on forever, but I think some also feel intimidated.  Everyone, well the only five or so people that actually talk always have really good ideas and are usually really smart, so others, including me, only think of the obvious when it comes to most of our discussions.  So either you don't want to state the obvious or someone else says it before you get the chance.  This has resulted that now when Ms. VA asks us all a question that no one really understands everyone leaves it up to the same people who always find a response that fits what she is looking for.  If people know they can get away without having to say anything during a discussion they will probably stay that way for the rest of the year, so unfortunately it seems that the same people will lead the discussions once more, unless something drastic changes.

       I would just like to make a comment in general.  I don't know if first period is the same, but our third period class really bums me out sometimes.  I am pretty vocal in class (I need to shut up sometimes) but honestly a lot of the time I end up raising my hand and commenting because so few people do!  Our class discussions consist of about five people talking, and everyone else just sitting there, and I think it would be really nice for everyone to get involved.  Just sharing a thought...

       Paul we're both too worried about our images.  Maybe we didn't need to apologize, but we'll just chalk it up to dignity and chivalry.  Even if our politics don't see eye to eye, we agree on the worth of the New York Times.  The NYT (as it is known by those IN the know) posts its articles online without a monetary fee of any kind, all they ask for is your e-mail.  If you want, The NYT will send you the morning headlines on the subjects that interest you (business, politics, international, sports, etc.) with links to their articles, but more on that later.    I haven't read DaVinci code, but I'm damn interested.  Copies are flying off the shelves, and I'm all for a nonstop read (I've read every Harry Potter book but the last one atleast 3 times, and I'm not ashamed to admit it).  For something shorter and tied to "Night," a town in Italy is attempting to convict several former Nazi SS members (a story I got through the free NYT e-mail headline service).  You can read about it here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  I have my opinions, but didn't read "Night," so I'd like it if someone else gave theirs.  I'm posting this on Miss Clark's blog as well, so if you have her for a teacher she feels neglected because her blog doesn't get this kind of action.  I'd also like other viewpoints on the issues and differences in opinions Paul and I worked ourselves through.  I'd enjoy this to be a political forum, and I know you all have something to say on the world as is today.  Love, Rob

       I feel I came off as too defensive.  I really don't mind anything political getting posted here, I just feel... obliged to post my rebuttal wherever it's relevant.  That being said, you really don't have to 'clarify yourself in a dignified manner'  I felt your original post, even if meant for Thomas' rather less tame personal blog, was fine and no personal slight at my personal politics at all.  I guess I was just on a defensive republican bent that night, probably worrying about Kerry's successful poll numbers:-)  So I guess I'm apologizing for sounding like a bitchy little republican, you really have no reason to apologize, clarification is often a must in debate but I really don't think you said anything out of line or offensive to me.  So to steer the conversation anyway in a different direction....  Who's read the Da Vinci code here?  I started reading it yesterday and really can't put it down.  There's nothing particularly wonderful or interesting in the prose, but I find the storytelling and suspense to be excellent, as well as the subject matter.

       Paul, your arguments were effective, logical, and I respect them.  While this isn't an excuse for anything I stated, the post was meant to go to Thomas Chen's personal blog, but I'm on three of them, and all the post screens look the same except for a small titleline in the top right corner, and I accidentally posted it on this one.  Anyway, the first half of this is an apology for the crude, unpolished, vulgar post from before.  This is not characteristic of me, as my previous posts (I hope) convey.  Back to the issue at hand...    I'll sum up the previous post in a more formal language; There is an element of monarchy (in both Democratic AND Republican parties) in that there is a lineage of elitists that are pedigreed to run the country, and that these families become separated from many of the realities of Joe American, which I believe manifests itself in the use of American soldiers as expendable tools.  John Kerry was one of these expendables, and as far is foreign policy is concerned, could draw from his personal experiences, which were perilous no matter what that article implied (Don't try to tell me that having a rocket shot at your boat doesn't deserve an award if you are the commander, as well as going after the shooter who could very well have been able to defend himself with another, closer-range firearm.  And don't forget the Oregon vet's story that was so popular on the campaign trail, and that may have been Kerry's push over Dean.  And demeaning the Purple-Hearts is also a joke... as if it was his obligation to reject them???  But I've digressed).  Back to the issue; a man who knows the detriments and personal losses of war would be more hesitant to thrust the volunteer (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMDs) soldiers (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMD's) into a frivolous war.  Point 2.  I believe Bush's war against Iraq is entirely a farce with negative short term and long term affects.  The short-term affects is the death toll that grows daily.  Long term affects are more anti-American senitiments that take a death toll and add hundreds or thousands in a single day (9/11, USS Cole, embassy bombings).  If a regime change is the goal, don't lie about it, but as of now Bush is using American men and women to fight for oil, which is necessary to accomodate America's mass automotive transportation.  And reflecting current consumer trends and the pressure on Bush to secure American jobs (ridiculous amounts of which outsourced by GM to Mexico), more gas is needed to satisfy the throats of gas-chugging SUV's, trucks, and to a lesser extent, vans; in all of said categories American companies generally control the market.  If gas gets too expensive, American cars depreciate in a hurry and sales numbers go down, resulting in more GM/Daimler Chrysler layoffs.  I'm entirely aware that Japanese car companies have success in this country for a variety of reasons, which I understand to be largely affordability, dependability, and gas mileage.   GM is one of the largest companies in America, and rather than allow the pressure from another market to create a need for quality improvement, Bush's actions act in giving American motor companies too much room for error.  The last point that a gas tax would emphasize fuel-efficiency, environmental protection, and reduce accidents is largely unarguable.  If you disagree with the principal of taxes, that's your opinion, but let me point out that Andrew Sullivan, the author of the article that brought the issue to my attention, is a REPUBLICAN.  Not that a Democrat wouldn't support it, but take care when you go throwing around those increasingly meaningless slanders such as "liberal and conservative."  I hope I have clarified myself in a somewhat dignified manner.  If I missed something, you have further questions, or just plain disagree, please post a response.  One more apology for accidentally posting a private on a public, I will be sure to take more care in the future.  Love, Rob

       I really don't have much to say about AP tests or ASB elections... but politics---  If military experience was a prerequisite for being a successful President or commander in chief of the armed forces I'd fear for the future of this country.  And I'd hardly compare Kerry to true war heroes such as Audy Murphy, here's a section of an article describing Kerry's Vietnam medals and tour.  But neither of those matter, the bottom line is, when you enlist in the military you are enlisting in the military.  You job is to be ready for war.  In war you are put in harms way.  Everyone in Iraq right now knew what they were getting into, we have a volunteer military.  The loss of every life, especially the civilian ones, is a great trajedy, the real issue is should we even be in Iraq, but that's a whole other issue.-     Kerry served on swift boats for about four months. During that time, he was awarded the Bronze Star (the lowest decoration for heroism in combat) and the Silver Star (the next higher decoration for valor) and three Purple Hearts for wounds sustained in battle. These latter decorations — like my title of "nationally syndicated columnist" — sound more impressive than they are. All three wounds were minor cuts from shrapnel, which, according to Kerry, caused him to miss a grand total of 2 days of duty.   For soldiers and Marines, especially of the enlisted variety, a Silver Star is a big deal. You've got to do something profound to get one. But the rules were different for officers, especially for naval officers.   This is the action on Feb. 28, 1969, for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star: A Viet Cong fired a B-40 rocket at Kerry's boat, Patrol Craft Fast-94. Tom Belodeau, manning the twin 50-caliber machine guns at the rear of the boat, opened fire on the VC, wounding him. The VC fled behind a hooch. Kerry ordered PCF-94 to shore, leaped out of the boat, pursued the VC, and finished him off.   I can envision grizzled infantrymen shaking their heads. "He got the Silver Star for that?"   Kerry had an advantage most servicemen do not. Medal recommendations have to be made by the commanding officer of the unit in which the heroism took place. Kerry was the commander of PCF-94. Presumably, Kerry's medal recommendation was made by the commander of the squadron to which PCF-94 belonged. But Kerry's commander wasn't there. The evidence he had of the heroism of Lt (jg) John F. Kerry came chiefly from the after action report of Lt. (jg) John F. Kerry.   Shortly after being awarded the Silver Star, Kerry took advantage of a provision in Navy regulations that permits a sailor who has been wounded three times to obtain early release from his combat tour. For Kerry — since his wounds were so minor — this was taking advantage of a technicality. There is nothing wrong with this. Many officers similarly situated would have done the same. But it wasn't heroic.   To recap: Kerry was a double volunteer. As a swift boat commander, he was brave and able. But I am unaware of any soldier or Marine who was awarded a decoration of any kind — much less the Silver Star — just for killing a wounded man who was running away.   Though it is being hyped far beyond what it warrants, Kerry's Vietnam service was honorable. What is not honorable is the way Kerry — in testimony before Congress in April, 1971 — falsely accused his fellow Viet vets of routinely committing grisly war crimes. Nor does it speak well of Kerry that in several demonstrations he marched under the flag of the Viet Cong. It is one thing to oppose the war in Vietnam. It is another to cheer for the enemy.     Why is there hope in John Kerry?  If the major issue with the president choosing to send troops to war, because of the evils of war, then no President since maybe Gerald Ford(I'm just guessing) would fit your criteria.  I find it hard to believe President Bush is as cold and heartless as he is portrayed to be here.  I really doubt he's any different than any other President, I'd just like to say that character slander is not an effective means of policy debate which is what is truly at debate here.  Tell me why Kerry won't be bought because his wife has billions?  Kerry is already bought, he's bought because he wants to win.  You can't buy votes with billions but you can buy votes with endorsements.  Kerry's wife is rich, yes, so she can fund his campaign along with George Soros.  But Kerry is already bought by the standard democratic special interest groups, labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers(by far the worst) because he hopes their endorsements will entice members of their groups to vote for him.  In exchange for those endorsements he agrees to give them more sway in his administration, it's just how the system works.  It would be nice if everyone looked out for everyone and the common good but that's not going to happen.  All politics are corrupt, Democrats and Republicans equally.  I agree completely that we went to Iraq for oil, and I don't think we should be there.  I certainly understand the benefits of securing a new nation under our sway in the middle east, removal of bases to Iraq from Saudi Arabia would certainly quell some anti American sentiment in that nation and put our bases closer to Israel.  OPEC has too much power over the United States economy and the global economy, but setting a precedent of a preemptive strikes frightens me.  Nothing would make me happier to see the US freed from oil, and the Bush administration has done an admirable job of using tax credits to push ahead gas/electric hybrids and to cut oil usage, such as in new federal requirements tying fuel efficiency requirements to vehicle weight.  The single issue of gas prices is not what gives the Japanese car makers the edge, it's a rather unique combination of luck, trade policies and union interference that has put detroit second to tokyo as of recently.  But this years trends from detroit have been towards cars, while some from Tokyo, most notably Nissan and Honda have certainly been to expand into less fuel efficient vehicles such as SUVs and trucks.  It's impossible to generalize on such as level or attribute it to something as arbitrary as gasoline prices.   Rob's suggestion of putting a 1 dollar tax on gas is why I'm not a democratic supporter as a general rule.  Liberal policies dictates a negative approach to social engineering.  Why not offer an incentive, a tax break on buying a gas efficient car or a hybrid.  Democratic ethos dictates, RAISE TAXES.  Push people away from gas, not try to entice them away.  The federal government is simply too inefficient and bureaucratic to justify it taking any more tax money from the private sector.  Democrats want to take it away more so than Republicans, but they both want it.  Lesser of two evils.  I guess that's a rather sad commentary on my approach to politics and maybe our system in general but I digress.  Read the New York Times at www.nytimes.com even if it's a liberal rag it still beats the pants off the Columbian and Oregonian combined.

       I would actually vote you for ASB president, believe it or not. And I would take on the responsibility of an ASB selected position if I can get my .5 credits of PE waived. I will already have five AP classes next year, and if the PE department won't be like a bigot like they usually do, I could manage my sixth period a leadership class. But if they become a usual royal pain in the ass, (Yeah they think PE is so much harder and more important than AP Literature or AP Physics) then I will have to resort to my last resort, and that is, to take all SIX AP classes.  But anyways, a new book just came out on Bush's secret plan to invade Iraq right when the invasion of Afghanistan started. The book is called "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward.  Peace out, and let's all have a moment of silence for all the innocent soldiers killed in Iraq.  Thomas Chen

       Stress is right...thank GOD for the weekend.  I'm taking three ap tests which will sound infantile and scoffable next to Tom's FIVE or so, but I'm working on Prom day and night.  Laugh if you want for me expending so much time and effort perpetuating a night of drunkeness and morally relaxed practices, I sometimes shake my head myself, but it's what I signed up for and it's hard and stressful.  Go to prom and appreciate my hard work damn it!  Any way... it sickens me that the people that send others to their death a.ka. the Bush administration, do so without feeling the pain so many American families do when they lose a brother/mother/father/sister/friend/lover/fellow blogger in Iraq.  Bush's connection with the world has been GENETICALLY REMOVED.  Whether like to think of it or not, we elect monarchies.  W. Bush is something like the great great great great nephew of Madison or something.  There's no difficulty tracing a Kennedy bloodline either.  There is hope in Kerry.  He opted to fight in Vietnam rather than lynch himself over a balcony, and his experiences there gave him credibility teaching (what should be the obvious) wrongs of war.  His wife has billions, so don't expect him to be bought, and he doesn't claim his greatest mistake was TRADING SAMMIE FUCKING SOSA.  The dumbass Bush couldn't run a major league baseball team successfully, but we gave him the country!?!?  Edwards was the best answer, but he was too decent to sling mud, so Kerry it is.  I think it's obvious we went to Iraq for oil, becaue Iraq isn't/never was a threat to the security of the u.s. (North Korea is however) and the war has done nothing but stimulate enrollment for Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and other groups hell-bent on making their suicide hurt anyone that's not Muslim.  Bush and Cheney are both oil-men (duh) and they're sick of having their balls in opec's vice, so they want to secure an oil flow.  How bout eliminating the need for oil?  Andrew Sullivan wrote a thought-provoking essay supporting the case for a gas tax of $1 per gallon.  It's what the rest of the world does, and it would result in a trend toward fuel-efficient cars, cut down on polution, and get many people off the road-reducing accident rates and deaths.  Bush won't do it though... it would give Japanese carmakers too much of an edge, and right now GM is pumping out SUV's as fast as bunnies are pump out kittens.  By the way, I'm going to run for ASB president next year, and I want to see some representation from the bloggers that post on this site.  Elias, Tom, Pav, et al. if you have schedule room, uncle sam wants YOU!  Help to keep the ASB diversified.  And if Alex R. still wants to talk shit bout Evan Cate, shame on him... I've been sitting on this for a while, but Evan is one of the most honest, genuine kids I know, and I'm glad he's my friend.  I'm out- talk back.  And if nonconformity becomes too popular, conform to nonconform.  Love Rob

       Thomas - I agree with you absolutely that individualism is absolutely great and that America is truly a country of immense opportunities.  But I think too many people in this country tend to look up to their heros who dared to be individuals, yet simply stay satisfied and happy that someone else represents them so well and that they can get by, by simply idolizing these heroes. Maybe its not right to say this, but there are too many people that look like blind, brainless cattle that has to be guided and taken care of. Not just in our school, or just in America, but everywhere I have been. I work as a teller and see many people come in during the day, but there are only a few faces that I recognize when they come back, becuase these faces have something special about them, like a special radiating energy of being different. Yet, I believe in a "friendly individualism," where people are not simply egoistic and competing, but where they help others and modivate people around them to develope their own individuality.  Rob - I think American culture as a whole seems to tend to idealize and make everything seem heroic. I just think that there are way too many controversies in American history and literature: Jefferson, freedom and slaves; WWII, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima & Nagasaki; Freedom, civil rights and gay marriages; the only thing that seems to go hand in hand is Bush and his idiotism (no offence to anyone).

       I'd have to agree with Natalya on the theme of Self-Reliance and individualism is one UNIQUE theme to American literature and Americans. This is probably the only time I will appear as an American egotistical bigot. But I truely believe that America is a country founded on progressive beliefs, reforming individuals, and revolutionary ideas. Famous Americans of the past had always had an urge for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of THINKING. The famous American authors of the past: from founding fathers Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, to Transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau, to poets Whitman, Dickinson, to realist writers Mark Twain, Faulkner, to muckrackers Tarbell, Steffens and to civil rights activist MLK; they all inspire Americans with the vivid themes of individualism and the interaction between the individual and the society. Many of them of course were all considered radicals just because of their progressive ideas. But they are some of the most brilliant Americans. All of them wanted to, and they did, forever change America for the better. Seriously, in comparison, Chinese classical literature is all about the art of war and at the same time harmony with nature (juxtaposed against each other), and respecting elders, and conforming to society (which of course, many of you know I abhor). Yeah the theme of individualism is a farfetch idea in most of the world.  To truely live up to the American ideal, I believe American citizens have to always strive for the theme of believe in one self, and strive for individual rights, and find one's unique place in the society.  It's when people stop thinking about American literature with the theme of individualism, self reliance, and self-expression, that causes me frustrated. When people stop using brain and thinking about the society with their own unique point of view, and let others make judgements for them, and blindly conforms to the mainstream society, then they've lost the integral value of American individualism. Losing one's unique place in the society fundamentally degrades the morals of human beings, and dictators dreams to have a society of dumb people that blindly conforms to the society. I don't believe that's what America, the land of opportunity, is all about.  Thus................Always think for yourself, and always question all authority.   As always, I welcome all dissagreements (P.S. Dissagreeing is also one element of American individualism).   Thomas Chen.

       Paul, thanks for bringing up the nature of other categories of national literature.  Last year we had a much more cosmopolitan curriculum, and thinking back to Dr. Zhivago, I have to agree with Natalya on the desolation that Pasternak wrote about.  We read about Okonkwo too, and the let down he obviously felt when his tribe was weakening.  We also have read some western European novels and essays- Tale of Two Cities, All Quiet on the Western Front, et al.  Tale of Two Cities was really a political observation where personal relationships just worked themselves out, and All Quiet addressed the feeling of hopelessness war carries.  America truly is unique that it hasn't had to experience the despariging wars (other than Civil War) that Europe and Asia have dealt with, and that's the best evidence I can uncover to explain the difference in literary themes.  Many people in the world view Americans as arrogant and possessing other undesirable characteristics.  Does the attitude that we can do it on our own come through in the lit?  Or do Americans just lust for heros?  I find this all very interesting.  Maybe Tristan will tell me what I want to hear.  Shifting gears, what did you all think of the in-class essay today?  I enjoyed it, but being a dick, I could swear that passage came out of Disability.  No matter how strong Mairs portrays herself, you can still see her pain in the words she uses.  Lastly, in his press conference, Bush claimed he couldn't think of a mistake he's made in office.  You have to respect the guy a smidge for believing in himself, but I'd like to make a list of mistakes he's made.  Ignoring all his verbal blunders, I'll start the list off with the suggestion that Saddam and Al Qaeda were linked, last time I checked it was a lie, and it got Clinton impeached (which he deserved).  If anyone's got an item to add, please post it.  Love Rob

       NIGHT.  A very compelling read.   But since everyone is talking about their books on here I thought I would mix it up a bit.......and give some references to music.  First of all, Im sure there are people out there with different tastes in music......I myself prefer a mix of alternative, rap, and classic rock.  Sorry I'm not an Enya fan.  First of all I would like to make the recommendation that by sigining up at Yahoo Music, you can create your own radio station that plays almost every genre, customized to your own style.  This is free and is VERY useful when I get sick of all the stuff that is played on the radio or on CD's.  But anyways......a few recommendations.....for a pop type of CD I would recommend Hoobastanks new CD, listen to "The Reason" or "Lucky".   I classic rock CD I would recommend would be the Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest Hits or anything by the Beatles(can't really go wrong with the Beatles)  A rap selection...lets see....Kayne West or Twista seem to be two of the most popular at the time but a solid choice would be Jay-Z's Black Album.....Jay-Z's last album.  If you are into the same music of me.....I would recommend anything by 3 Doors Down or the Goo Goo Dolls.....very solid choices in those albums.  Anyways, just thought I would mix up the blog with a little culture.  -Pat

       Beck- I absolutely love you, no seriously, it's like you have been reading my mind, only you are way better in expressing it. I agree that it's funny how we worry about the least important things every day, and if you look at the big picture our lives so unimportant, they can be simply compared to that pile of ants, each ant is so small and what he does is so small, and yet I am sure he thinks that what he is doing is important. I mean, 4 children die every hour from malnutrition... strange, I have been reading Biology for the past hour... 4 children just died... do I feel anything? No. Can I even comprehend the fact that 4 innocent lives just died? Not really. I was watching the news today and they were talking about one of the Italian hostages being killed in Iraq, and I remember thinking: they make such a big deal out of this one death when at the same time there are hundreds, thousands of people dying every day. I think it's simply because we have gotten used to these statistics of how many people are dying in Africa from AIDS and how many have died during the Holocaust.  The horror simply gets saturated and you get used to it, and that's how saw Wiesel's experience as his story extended in the book: the first time he saw babies been thrown into the flames of crematory his reaction was " How could it be possible for them to burn people, children, and for the world to keep silent? No, none of this could be true. It was a nightmare...," compared to the reaction of when his father is taken away to the crematory "I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I had no more tears. And, in the depth of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched it, I might perhaps have found something like - free at last!" I have heard from many people about Night and everyone said that they cried whenever they read it, but strangely the first time I read the book I didn't shed a tear. I have read many books like this one, I cried reading "The Pianist," and "All Quiet on the W. Front," even "Of Mice and Men" but this one was dry, it felt as if Wiesel was simply stating facts and these facts have been already known and there was simply too much of it and too hard to believe that such things could be true, too saturated with horror.   Paul - it does feel like self-reliance is much more prominent in American literature than in any other. At least drawing on what I know about Russian literature that's the feeling I get. I read A LOT of Russian novels and most have this trend of sorrow, grief and disillusionment with the people and world around, maybe that's why Russians tend to be so "mean," cynical and full or sarcasm. But I think Russian authors are great on analyzing human nature, and our lonely desolate souls; read "Crime and Punishment."  Ryan- you know it's funny how in America everyone simply stands up for himself and takes care of his own private business, but that does leave us lonely and without friends or anyone to talk to. George has to get rid of his burden too in order to be able to go on, but does he need the farm, now that he doesn't have his friend to share it with? Does the old man, Candy, want to go on, now that he lost his dog, his only friend? I think self-reliance and independence are over-rated.

       Going off of Ryan Elliot's post, the theme of loneliness struck me the most when I read 'Of Mice and Men.' The old man who lost he dog is so frightened of being all alone for the rest of his life that he still wants to join George and Lennie's dream farm even after Lennie kills Curley's wife. Also I think that Curley's wife is one of the loneliest people in the novel. I think the thing she wants the most is a friend and someone to talk to. She's so lonely that she tries too hard to be liked by all the farmhands thus becoming unpleasant to be around. She dislikes her husband and she doesn't know who to turn to. Lennie is the only person who will talk to her. However, it's also Lennie who ends up killing her.  On a side note I think Paul's post was really interesting about self reliance being more of a human concept in our literature.   I think it would be nice to "live on the fatta and lan."  :)

       Amazing what extra credit will do for a blog, won't it;-)  I never really have much to say anymore, but I know our whole theme this year has been self reliance in American literature.  If self reliance is American literature, what's British literature, or French literature or Russian literature or Chinese literature.  I'm simply curious as to if it's really uniquely American, or more a human concept in our literature.  As for turning the blog political, I say go for it, I just wish I had more time to frequently check in here.

       I'm really liking the fact that so many people are posting.  There are a lot of good ideas generated in each mind/group/class period, and I'm really enjoying reading them so keep it up!  (Beck, your post was especially eloquent)  Today in class, (M&M) discussion seemed especially productive in my group, and I thought we came up with a really thought-provoking level 3 q.  Lennie and George rely on each other for various reasons; does their relationship signify a shift in American Literature AWAY from self-reliance?  I think it's quite interesting because since Emerson and Franklin to Huck Finn, there has always been that underlying theme.  The suggestion that Lennie and George can be viewed as one entity and are self-reliant in that way was one way of countering the question, but has anyone read anything to suggest that there is a paradigm shift in American Lit?  What events could be triggering this shift?  Post your thoughts, and anything else you'd like to say... I'd like this blog to become somewhat of a politcal/current events forum as well, because I like to argue.  Love Rob

       I wasn't so excited to start reading these books, but I had heard that Of Mice and Men was an excellent book.  It is very intersting to see how Steinbeck shows how much these two men resemble people in a family.  I relate this a lot to myself, I see Lennie as my brother who has some difficulties and challenges, and me as George.  Sometimes I get real fed up with him, and extremely annoyed, and I do things like George that then tend to hurt his feelings, make me feel bad and then apologize and make it up to him.  My brother is also big like Lennie, and if anyone else trys to take advandtage of him or make fun of him, it ticks me off.  The same thing is with George, no one else can do anything to Lennie except him.  I like the way Steinbeck uses a lot of sentence manipulation so you can get a real grip of the attitude the characters have espcecially Lennie, it really helps the reader get into the book more.

            In a discussion about "Of Mice and Men" our group observed that George and Lennie's mutualistic friendship creates a theme of interdependence, which differs from the popular theme of self-reliance of the past semester.  The works of Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin represent the fruits of solitude, and promote the benefits of self-sufficiency.  In contrast, Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" shows the loneliness of seclusion and explains how interpersonal relationships are necessary in leading a fulfilled life.  When George and Lennie arrive at the ranch they are hired to farm, their bond surprises a well respected ranchhand named Slim.  George takes exception to Slim's reaction and Slim explains there aren't "many guys who travel around together...maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other."  Slim and the some of the other workers are envious and almost admire the friendship George and Lennie share.  Their relationship enables them to divide the stress of work and travel, as opposed to bearing it individually.  As the novel progresses the theme of mutualism stretches to recruit other characters.  Candy, an old, one-handed swamper, loses his dog to old age and sees lonely, desolate days ahead of him.  This depresses him and he spends most of his time staring at the wall of his bunk.  Crooks, the negro stable buck, isn't allowed to play cards with the guys, and is forced to sleep in a solitary room away from his peers.  Time eats away at these friendless men because as Crooks put it, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."  Although self-reliance produces independence and pride within a man, it cannot pat him on the back, play a game of cards, or swap stories the way a friend can.  Living as an equal in the world is an inherent human goal, and to sacrifice societal equality for isolation produces a burning loneliness that must be tempered with humanity.    A few thoughts- Ryan Elliott

       Like many others, after today's small group discussion I have new thoughts on the book Night.  My group spent much of the period analyzing what the main theme of the book was and we came to two conclusions.  The first theme that we noticed was the naive/optimistic attitude the Jews had towards the Germans and the treatment they would receive in the events that led up to being sent to Auschwitz.(sp?)  The basis behind this theme most likely comes from the strong faith Jews had in God at this time period.  Even after being sent to the concentration and experiencing the cruel treatment of the Germans, Jews still had an optimistic view stating "God must be testing us."  Although Weisel himself begins to lose faith in God, many Jews still believed God was "just testing them."    The second theme my group noticed was individualism in the concentration camps.  Because the happenings at Auschwitz are so horrible, they begin to mold the spirit of many of the prisoners, Wielsel in particular.  This theme is best shown when Wiesel's father is being beaten severely by a crazed guard.  Instead of Wiesel becoming angry toward the guard, he instead is angry at his father for getting in the guards way.  Wiesel, like many others, lose their ties with family and friends in an effort to "fend for themselves" at the concentration camps.   These are the two most prominent themes my group saw in the book, are we missing a big one?  -Pat

        During the group descussions today in class, my group noticed something very interesting. I don't know where i'm going to go with it, but i thought i might throw it out there anyway. Our group was talking about Night, and we were busy discussing how horrific/depressing the book is when we heard a neighboring group mention how someone in the other book had lost his pet mouse and therefore all the joy in his world. We went kind of silent for a minute and looked at each other. How does a mouse compare to the Halocaust? And then we just went back to our discussion.   But i've been stuck on it all day, and i think that our reaction has as much to say as the juxtoposition of the books does. And i think that it all has something to do with the human ability to completely ingore huge, world changing events (or the inability to understand them), like the halocaust. I'll let the great Eddie Izzard make the next point:   "Pulpot killed 1.7 million people, we can't even deal with that. I think we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prision. If you kill 10 people, you to to Texas, they hit you with a brick. That's what they do. Twenty people, you go to a hospital, they look at you through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Somebody's killed one hundred thousand people, we're almost going, 'well done! well done, you killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down to the gym.' ...So i suppose we're glad that Pulpot's under house arrest, at least we know where he is. Just don't go in that house, you know?"   Some people would probably say that we find little ways to deal with huge or horrible things ...like pet mice. But i think that we just completley ignore them. A revolution in Haiti? Ten thousand citizens dead in Iraq? Ariel Sharon pulls out of the West Bank? Terrorists attack Madrid? Oh. Okay. ...Did i leave the iron plugged in? God, my boyfriend's being so annoying these days. Do i look fat in this shirt?... Nevermind the 25 million people that die every year from hunger. Or the 34.3 million people who are looking a little skinny since they contracted AIDS.   I'm not suggesting that we should think about this all the time every day, but it is valuable to be reminded every now and then.   So yeah... I'd put some sort of conlcusion on this... but it'd be way easier if people posted responses (seeing as you all completely ignored my last post) that i could then steal ideas from.  -Beck

       I just have to mention the observation that as if 7:02 April 13th, we have two distinct ads on top JUXTAPOSED to each other. One about "supporting the loving conservative BUSH administration", and the other "Support Anti-War movement". Kind of hilarious. Yeah if you haven't figured out, Google (the owner of blogger), periodically "reads" your blogs and accordingly put appropriate banner ads on top. So our posts about drafts, holocaust probably caused google to put those ads up.  And Megan, that quote there from Night is really insightful. Especially the part of "if we forget, we are guilty". (That's why history, historiography, and historical literature is so important). And finally Rob, to bring up that draft thing into perspective, it was actually two democrats who first initiated the plan. They think it would "democratize" the army system. Because they think it's not fair for a special group of people to fight. And of course many many Republicans support their plans, it helps them win their ambition of occupying Iraq. But yeah, there is some level of extremely scary muti-partisan support of the draft in the congress right now.

       I finished 'Night' today. Mrs. VA said we may have to read it in chunks if it became to emotional for us, but I found myself not being able to put it down. I went online and looked up information about Elie Wiesel. I read his Nobel Prize Acceptance speech. Check it out, it's really good.  http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/ElieWiesel/Nobel_Speech.htm I also found some pictures of him. Mostly when he was older, but I found a picture taken when he was 15 or 14 before he was in the concentration camps. It made me think about the end of the book when he's looking in the mirror. I looked at the picture and I tried to imagine what he looked like at the end of the war. Here's a good quote from Wiesel. I think it does a pretty good job at summerizing why he wrote 'Night' and why understanding what happened during the Holocaust is so important.  "I have tried to keep memory alive, I have tried to fight those who would forget.  Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices...That is why I swore never to be silent whenever wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. "

       I'm a "Mice and Men" kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' "it's a comfortable read" quote.  It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly.  Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected.  Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military?  Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries.  Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again?  Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq.  Afghanastan was a justified war.  I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade.  What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade.  He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief.  Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected.  I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions.  The more I think about it the sicker I get.  I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit.  Love, Rob  P.S.  I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.

       Maybe contrary to a lot of people, I'm reading "Of Mice and Men". The book so far is faring better than it's intro paragraphs, which when I heard Ms.VA read in class today, I thought it would be so boring. But right now it's becoming more and more like a Western Thriller book, with A LOT of Western vernacular language (as oppose to the Southern vernacular language we encountered in Huck Finn). It's easy to relate to that a lot of language directly imitates the coloquial language as people are speaking (non-sensored words). So overall, a comfortable read.  Other than that, I encountered this article:  urlLink  about some members of the congress are even THINKING of RE-INSTATING the DRAFT.........Utterly sick..........   Yeah anyways, thats a great article, also talks about in December 2003 the United States had 1.44 million troops stationed in 141 countries.  And here is an excerpt from an article from CNN:    CHARLES RANGEL   Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet   Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home.   To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the "citizen soldier" ideal that has served our nation so well.  As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices.   CHARLES MOSKOS   Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee   Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls.   We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories   JAMES INHOFE   Republican Senator from Oklahoma   I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country.   I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.

       So far I am really enjoying the novel 'Night' due to the way in which the novel is written.  The novel consists of choppy, simple and compound sentences, to enforce the view which he is writing from(a child's) while also creating a fearful, anxious tone in the book that comes from these choppy sentences.  In class, Ms. V-A spoke of the novels "poetic tone."  I believe this tone is derived from the sentence structure Wiesel uses in the novel(or atleast the first 15 pages).  Is everyone else seeing this tone? Or something different?  -Pat

       Ya, I also already read 'Of Mice and Men.' I also read the New York Times at 4:30 in the morning everyday. I only read it then because I have to wake up early for zero period. 'Night' is really good so far. Really really sad though. My math teacher said he read the book when he was in high school and that it gave him nightmares. I hope I don't get nightmares. I don't know about the rest of you but AP testing is comming up too quickly.

       Why didn't more people choose 'Of Mice and Men' than 'Night', there appeared to be at least twice as many people reading Night.  For me personally, I've already read Night so Of Mice and Men was the logical choice.  And go read the New York times, it's free online, www.nytimes.com it's good for the brain.

       Hey, I hope you all had a fantastic break... I know I did.  I read "Catcher In The Rye" over the break because there are a lot of references to it in other media sources...Six Degrees of Seperation and Chasing Amy are two movies that the book influences, but I never really felt the significance of it.  It's a book narrated by a student our age about himself.  He's having trouble dealing with his life- he makes references to suicide, he's kind of cynical, thinks everyone's a "phony," as well as intermitently dealing with the death of his brother.  It's written coloquially (like Huck Finn only NINETEEN 50's), and it's kind of funny at times because Holden (the narrator) is such an oddball character, but it's nothing that's really going to change my life.  If you're disconnected with your surroundings and like a straightforward read, you could identify with "Catcher," or if you're Thomas, and are rooting for the nonconformist protagonist, you might really identify.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected, but I AM looking forward to "Of Mice and Men."  Love, Rob

       I visited some schools on the East Coast, and they had similar requirements. For Cornell and NYU, they usually take 4's and always take 5's. It appears some places accept 3's on a few tests, but that usually just allows you to transfer out of the class, it doesn't get you any credits. To actually get college credits takes a 4, or a 5, they seem to be more strict on the science and English tests most places I looked.

       Hey that's a very good question and interesting topic. Yeah some school may offer a credit system in which a 3 may get you into a basic class, and 4 or 5 a more advanced class. But in order to eliminate 5 or more credits, most schools has to see that you have at least a 4 or 5 on most AP exams.  UW is a very typical example of this AP credit system. Here is a link to see how much credits UW offer base on your AP scores:  urlLink UW AP Class Credits

       I know this may be very off topic but I just returned from Gonzaga and found out that Gonzaga and many other schools demand a 4 on the AP Test to count for college credit.  While many of us last year when taking the World History exam believed that to "pass" we needed to get a 3.......well I guess we passed but it doesn't count for anything at alot of the schools that we may be trying to get into when applying next year.  I have also heard a rumor that the University of Washington doesn't accept 3's......this is only a rumor but I would like to hear from anyone else who visited schools to see what other schools demand on the AP Test to count for college credit.                            -Pat

       I started reading "Fountainhead" a while ago, but I wasn't able to finish it. Too much stuff going on. If anyone is looking for a good book to read I recommend anything by Ayn Rand. She's an amazing author.  Over spring break I plan to read "A Passage to India." I don't know much about it. My mom said it was good book. I should start reading it but I'm too absorbed in another book called "Battle Royale." It's by a Japanese author, and the book reminds me a lot of "Lord of the Flies."  The government sends a bunch of kids out on an island and they have to kill each other and whoever is left alive at the end wins. It has a lot to do with government control over the people and what fear can cause you to do. It also relates to the saying of it's a dog eat dog world. It's really bloody, but interesting.  Recently in AP US History we just finished up with WWII. We watched some video clips of the Holocaust with was really shocking for me. Anyway, I remembered something Mrs. VA said about her German friend and how he is still paying for WWII through high taxes, and how he was really upset because he had nothing to do with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. An interesting book which relates to this is "The Reader" by German author Bernhard Schlink. It's a deep book containing a lot of philosophy. It centers around a young man who wasn't involved in WWII but still has to deal with the horrors of postwar Germany.

       Well yeah, "Fountainhead" has a very straight-forward message for individuality, which I absolutely adore, but some people can probably find it a bit too zealous. Are you going to write the scholarship paper for the book Thomas? I think it's due on April 15th. I think you should also add a link to fastweb.com, maybe some people will find some good scholarship opportunities to write for.  Do you have that list of 100 recommended books from collegeboard.com? I have "Candide" next on my list; let me know how good the book is.

       Very inspirational post there Natalya. I agree that we need to have lots more multiple choice practices. And more examples and practices of creating the three levels of questions would be very helpful. Hmm I never thought "Fountain Head" was that good. I'm personally reading this philosophical book by Voltaire called "Candide". What are you all guys reading for spring break?

       Well I joined you guys here too. I was looking at the AP English Barron's book and it seems that in order to do well on the test we need a lot of just practice of taking the answers and knowing what kind of questions are on the test and how to interpret, it's kind of like SATs or ACTs, you do better on english part with more practice. I hope after spring break we will have a lot of practice on the AP mult choice and some timed writing.     The Challenge is to read some good books, I personally recommend "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand about individuality, the best book I have read and very inspirational. Also if you want some more background on the Holocaust you might want to read "The Pianist" or rent the movie, which I found to be very powerful, yet disturbing. I find reading literature such as "Night" important to remind myself every so often how superficial our problems are when compared to what people had to undergo during Holocaust, WWI, WWII, and even now around the world. Though I find it ironic to see American propaganda against German Nazis and the genocide directed toward Jews, when arguably Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be viewed as genocide directed toward "Japs." Also the fact that U.S. was supporting Iraq against Iran at the time when Sadaam was gassing Curds is especially interesting since the Kurds genocide is one of the reasons we had the war with Iraq. History is very controversial, especially when put in the context of literature. So yeah, liberty and justice for all (with exceptions to those that are different from "all").

Anyway, I wasn't in class for English today, would anyone like to let me know what the "Spring Break Challenge" is?  It was mentioned on the syllabus, but haven't heard about it since.  Have great breaks everybody!  Love, Rob

I appreciate your optomism about the assembly, I'm not on the committee so I can just sit back with my fingers crossed and enjoy.  Did anyone approach you about being a model???  If not, we'll have you up there next year in the trashiest outfit Anchor Blue has to offer.  I can see it now...you'll be strutting your stuff down the runway, stopping, turning, throwing your jacket over your shoulder and giving a sexy, heart stopping look Derek Zoolander himself would be proud of.  You're a natural-born star, Tom.  Maybe you can guest-star as a breakdancer for the Rick White experience.  Love,  Rob

       Hello all! We've got quite the rousing discussion going on here, and I figured that I should contribute.  (Sorry this got half published before, I don't know what happened)  I wanted to respond to Ryan E and point out that there have been reports of at least 8,000 and up to 10,000 Iraqi civilians killed in our invasion of their country. I no longer pledge allegiance to our flag. Of course there are many reasons why I no longer pledge allegiance (the false election in 2000; Martha Stewart going to prison while Ken Lay, and countless others, get off; the "defense of marriage act*" +constitutional amendment, the "no child left behind act," and the "patriot act") but the war is a major one right now.   I also agree with Rob though. I suppose it's alright if they keep "under god" in our little third period prayer. It really doesn't bother me; when I still said the pledge, I simply left that part out. And yet, the wanted gap between church and state that would justify keeping "under god" (with Rob's argument) isn't always evident. When the president says, "Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots..." (2/24/04) I lose confidence in the separation between his religious convictions and his political policies.   Here's a site that put the war into perspective: http://www.infoshout.com/the_toll.htm ...Liberty and justice for all, eh?  *AHH! How can they use words like "defense" and "protection" when all you need is $54 to get a license? No proof of love, no plan of action for good intentions, just some cash and a couple signatures. http://www.thestranger.com/2004-03-11/city4.html     ~Beck Nelson~

       First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break? Because they all spark my interest. Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning. Love,  Rob

       This is a repost, I accidentally posted over an earlier post of mine, so if it appears twice, you now know why.  I'm about as tech-smart as the chair I'm sitting on.

       Thomas thank you for setting this up.  It took a while but I finally got your email.  Today is Memorial Day and I was just thinking how much I appreciate all the freedoms and protection we have as Americans.  Both of my grandpas went to war.  On my mom's side my grandpa served for four or more years and on my dad's side he served for about four years as well.  It's crazy to think that they went through so much for us today.  It's also weird knowing that someday some of us might take part in a war.  I just wanted to get my first post out and see what other people thought about on Memorial Day.  GOD BLESS!

       Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP English website for the better. There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our AP English friend's blogging profiles. And I've added two things:   1: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 2: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post.   THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS!  Thomas

       As the year winds down, I want to give some love to the class, especially everyone that posts.  We've had some good times, and I think it would be both mentally beneficial as well as fun to continue blog participation through the summer.  Pat, your essay was inspiring.  I'll be interested to see how the follow-through manifests itself this summer.  Look forward to raisin some philanthropic funds at the fireworks tent across from Blackjack.  To all you potential fireworks buyers this July, Support The Fort!  Blackjack has some good advertising and stuff, but it's run by some weird ass people, I know from experience.  Natalya, I hope your experience doesn't support the thesis you've generated from TEWWG.  I won't deny that some fellas have very rigid beliefs as to how a woman deserves to be treated, but don't let that discourage any of you fine young women.  There are plenty of GOOD guys to go around.  A little format note; I've always wondered how publishing companies created the extended dash, but I've figured it out!  (I have a bloody iMac, so I'm not sure about this on Windows, but...)  Holding the option key and shift key, pressing the button in between the 0 and = key produces the punctuation I've long looked for: — (compared to -).  This makes me so happy!  My essay I wrote easily in one sitting.  It was nice to forego a certain amount of literary analysis and focus on personal response because I felt like I was able to get something off my chest.  I'll post it if desired, but it's more or less a more personal extension of the post with the long quote.  Lastly (this is a very quick-moving post), the Harry Potter story line is nothing new.  The classic series'; Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars have taken the theme of the conflict between Good and Evil and given it a different setting.  The story lines each include some standard elements of personal struggle and sacrifice, making the story quite predictable, yet gripping nonetheless.  For example, Luke Skywalker must resist the Dark Side of the Force, Frodo frequently expresses the grip he knows the ring has on him, and even Harry Potter fought with himself in his choice of House, ultimately siding against Slytherin's beckoning promise of power.  I could make a pretty good guess to the end of the series because they all end very similarly, but I will NOT stop reading them till Voldemort is contained and Harry graduates (or maybe he dies in sacrifice, that OCCASIONALLY happens, but I doubt it in this instance).  The key to writing a successful series is the ability to weave reader interaction into a story as Rachel addressed, and equally important, putting a unique spin on the fantastic setting.  To reiterate, I love you all  Love, Rob

       I found Catcher in the Rye to be a bit scary too once I realized that Holden was really mentally unstable. My paper was a parody on Holden and I just hope Mrs. VA won't be too disturbed by the "creativity" of my imagination in this paper. It was actually really fun to explore the thoughts of a potential character like that, I could draw a lot for my writing from my guy-friends and their thoughts that they express verbally, I think I could write a whole book just in that kind of a colloquial style, exploring the different ideas people have in their mind during the day.   I ran our of my reading mood, so Their Eyes were Watching God is only half finished for now, but so far my reaction to it is: men are sexist and generally evil, with rare exceptions. That is of course an exaggeration but the feeling I get from the book so far is that men find a girl, get what they want from her, that is love and attachment and then either get bored and move on to another "victim" or exploit the already used and hypnotised girl to fullest potential. I just couldn't believe it how Janie's first husband first begged her to marry him and then went to by her a mule so that she could plow his fields. The same with her second husband Jody who first says: "you behind a plow! You ain't got no mo' business wid uh plow than uh hog is got wid uh holiday! ... A pretty dall-baby lak you is made to sit on de front porch and rock and fan yo'self and eat p'taters dat other folks plant just special for you." It's ridiculous how he very soon placed her behind the counter of his shop and scoundreled her for miscounting. I just wouldn't believe the swift change from adornment to "... you [Janie] need tellin'. Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows. I god, they sho don't think none theirselves." I just love the comparison between women and chickens, no wonder the word "chicks" addressed toward girls is still in the lexicon. I want to finish the book though, maybe Tea Cake will bring some optimistic news about the race of men and will lower down my cynicism.   I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas about the significance of Janie's beautiful hair and the crazy mule running around.  Call me a nerd but I love Harry Potter books, they are just so beyond imagination it's fascinating. They inspire me to write something like that too, only it's hard to come up with new ideas for a story; I think I am going to go think about some potentially successful ideas for a plot, maybe that will get me into Harvard, or at least I could make millions of dollars selling the books and then just bribe the admisions officers;) I think the movies are not that great though. Lord of the Rings series were better and closer to the actual book. These kinds of books are just fun to read in order to get away from the ordinary world, afterall it gets really boring here sometimes and they don't take that long to read becuase they have such straigh-forward ideological content: the good always wins, yet I have to agree with Pat that they are a bit stricky in the story line. I am still struggling with Fountainhead though, that book is insane, the more I read of it the harder it becomes and the more I want to read it.

       I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to read some of the other papers that students have written to see different perspectives on the topics.  I will share mine, it was based on The Great Gatsby, and I chose the second prompt that concerned how the book has influenced our beliefs....read mine but I would   really   like to read others papers so please share.  A Positive Influence on My Beliefs  	I have been raised to believe in the importance of Christian values that have shaped me into the moral person I am today.  After reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and encountering the degradation of values concerning upper-class society in the 1920’s, I have been influenced to strengthen my moral values. 	Fitzgerald’s novel is portrayed through a description of two wealthy Long Island communities where the center of attention is the Gatsby mansion where “The Great Gatsby” holds his famous parties where Fitzgerald focuses his novel on the characters of Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway(the narrator).  Fitzgerald uses the beliefs of these characters to mock and show the beliefs of 1920’s upper-class society. 	Jay Gatsby is an “Oxford man” who, after fighting in World War I becomes fabulously wealthy through criminal business to pursue his love-Daisy Buchanan.  Gatsby is portrayed as a mysterious figure who everyone admires for his extravagant amount of wealth.  Gatsby’s attitude toward money is shown in a quote that is taken from a flashback on Gatsby’s life stating  “To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.”  The authors reasoning for showing the materialistic attitude is for the reader to make the connection of how money can corrupt one’s thinking.  Gatsby, like many other characters in the novel, is so engrossed in wealth that it seems to be the sole thing that gives him satisfaction in his life.  	Gatsby’s obsession with wealth is nothing compared to the attitude of Daisy Buchanan, a longtime lover of Gatsby.  Daisy Buchanan is not interested in love, but completely in material possessions.  Daisy’s attitude is best described in a quote when Daisy is admiring en extensive collection of Gatsby’s shirts.  She states,  “They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds.  ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.”  Fitzgerald is able to portray a multitude of character insights in this small quote.  First and foremost Fitzgerald is depicting Daisy as a fool for being so engrossed in a collection of shirts.  Also, the author gives insight as to what Daisy’s true love is-wealth.  Daisy married her husband Tom because he had money, not because she loved him as a person.  Tom knows what Daisy’s true love is, and in response began an affair with a woman in the city.  Fitzgerald uses Daisy’s attitude and the relationship between Tom and Daisy to show the corrupt beliefs of upper-class marriages during this time period.  Fitzgerald is saying that upper-class marriages weren’t based upon love-but two selfish people getting what they, without regard to morals. 	While most the characters are immersed in materialism, Nick Carraway has contrasting beliefs.  Nicks beliefs are based upon morals, not money.  In the end of the novel, Nick makes the decision to move away from the upper-class society of the East, and move back to the Midwest where morality is more important than money.  Nick describes his decision when saying “...the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.  So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry on the line I decided to come back home.”  Nick makes a decision to get away from what he knows will influence him and eventually corrupt his beliefs. 	Through analyzing the beliefs of these characters, my own personal beliefs have been influenced greatly.  Fitzgerald’s portrayal of a corrupt upper-class society made me realize that I am so very fortunate and that I take for granted the wealth that I am immersed in.  I am far from a Daisy Buchanan, but am still caught up in material possessions from time to time.  After reading this book, I am sickened that the upper-class in this book wasted their lives living a life where they were unable to love one another normally because they were so greatly influenced by material possessions.  What is the point in having an extravagant shirt collection?  Where is the need to host a party every weekend that leads to a myriad of people being plastered with alcohol.  It is a complete waste that I don’t ever want to be a part of.   I have developed such strong beliefs from reading this book that instead of spending my money on upgrading my car this summer, it will go towards something useful.  I am so very glad I read this book, for it opened my eyes to what is really important in life and that is not possessions, it is giving back when I have the ability to share my wealth. 	 SO THERES MY PAPER.......WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK?

       First of all, I have to say that Pat you couldn't explain Harry Potter any better.  Something about the plot captivates the reader, but I have never stopped to think about what it could be... How could I when I wasn't even able to stop to put them down?  Being a person that has read all of the Harry Potter books countless numbers of times, everytime I read them I pick up on another clue that has a link to a later point in the plot.  You don't even understand how excited I was to realize that Moony, was because he was a wearwolf, Wormtail was because he was a rat and had a tail like a worm, Padfoot the dog, and Prongs was the stag.  I seriously set down my book and was amazed... Maybe it was a little more obvious for others, but when different things in the book all of a sudden click and come together and you get the feeling that a light bulb just came on, its irreplaceable.  That's why these books are good for all ages, younger kids wouldn't necessairly make all of the connections but the mere plot and setting of a magical place that all of us wish we could be a part of would be enough to draw them in.  While adults and teenagers are able to make all of the small connections that makes for a thrilling read. As you can tell, I'm absolutly in love with Harry Potter, and June 4th is marked on my calender! I can't even wait...  Now for a more serious side, Ryan I can see exactly what you mean about Their Eyes Were Watching God.  It definitly focuses on how money and status are not everything in a relationship and you can't "buy" love.  Although it's always said, but it's true, love only comes on its own.  Janie could have had anything she wanted when she was with Jody, but the love was not there.  However when she was with Tea Cake and didn't have a big house and everything else she was never happier. It just goes to show that love is the most important part of relationships and nothing can replace it.   - Rachel Penny

       	The most respected black writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Richard Wright, said of Zora Neale Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, “[it] carries no theme, no message, no thought,” and after reading the novel for myself I came to the conclusion that Mr. Wright’s perspective and preformed filters limited his ability to perceive the delicate and emotional subtleties of the story.  Their Eyes Were Watching God records one woman’s pursuit of love, a venture which is beautifully complex and unexpectedly educational.  Unlike a majority of black writers in the 1930s who created serious, in-your-face literature, Hurston chose to write a novel that extended beyond the black protest tradition and connected with readers on a level unaffected by race or gender.  Hurston does not blatantly broadcast an image of black struggle as her early critics would have preferred; instead, she unfurls a story, revealing intricacies of love and emotion that many men are never privy to.  Although writers such as Richard Wright believe love to be trivial in comparison to the awareness of black oppression, Hurston’s novel should be commended for discussing unique and unexplored topics.  Their Eyes challenges the notion that riches and status alone can attract a woman to a man, and reinforces the message that a man must respect a woman for her mind for a relationship to be truly fulfilling.  The emotional journey of Janie Crawford, the female protagonist, encouraged me to believe that true love is attainable through perseverance, and that the tragedy of loss is outweighed by the memories of time spent with a soul mate.

       Hi everyone! I have finally been given permission to post on our class blog.  I just wanted to make a quick post and say hello.  The Catcher In The Rye was a quick, and enjoyable read.  I thought this book was very depressing, which, I'm sure, is a shared opinion between those of us who have read it.  Holden, the main character, scared me quite a bit.  Throughout his decline, I began to notice quite a lot of similarities between he and I; this is scary because Holden loses control of his life.  I'm curious to find what other people's opinions are of this book, and if they felt any connection with Holden.

       I've mentioned how much I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code on this blog before and Pat's post about Harry Potter is similar to how the Da Vinci Code is affecting adults.  The book isn't too long, and isn't hard to read, but it's not a ground breaking novel either.  The subject matter I think is what has made the book so popular at first glance.  Everyone knows about the Holy Grail legend, Leonardo Da Vinci, and secret societies.  The success of the book builds upon itself, like Harry Potter, word of mouth causes a snowball effect on popularity.  But I digress, I just hope the movie is as good as the book.

       With the approach of the latest Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, I would like to take some time to reflect upon arguably the personally fulfilling series of books I have read. (Don't laugh, I know all of you read these books.....and love them)  First of all, the genius of J.K. Rowling is her organization.  How many times have you been reading these books and come across a turn in the plot, and then remembered hearing a small clue earlier in the book or in a past book that led directly to a crucial part in the book.  To clarify that last statement I will give some examples.  EX 1: Harry has to live with the Dursleys-find out later this gives him protection when he's away from Hogwarts.  EX 2: Ron's rat Scabbers-find out later it is Wormtail, supporter of Voldemort who framed Sirius and lived with Ron and his family to be able to hear news from the wizarding world concerning Voldemorts whereabouts/possible return.   While the plot is deeply woven for a simple children's novel, this is not the only reason for the success of these books.  What makes these books so wildy popular is the way in which the reader is so captivated by the setting of a wizarding world in which spells and flying is a reality.  What kid could resist a fantasy like this?  I sure couldn't.  I am 17 years old and am still spellbound(pun).  I have talked to adults that are more obsessed than I am.  If anyone caught last weeks TRL on MTV is was all about Harry Potter and kids dressed up in robes and competed to get a role on the next Harry Potter film. One girl participating was able to name the license plate number of the Weasley's car in the second movie.....that is seriously ridiculous.  Speaking of ridiculous, the winner was a kid about our age who literally was jumping up and down, crying with joy after he won the contest.  I'm sorry but after reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography I was hardly jumping up and down with joy.(I am not bashing Benjamin Franklin-just pointing out how a setting can contribute to the joy of reading a novel)  So now that I have gone off on a tangent, I would like to hear from anyone else that has been so engrossed in the novels as I have.  Call me obsessive, I don't even care.  Read the books-then call me obsessive.  Yes, these novels will probably not help you get into an Ivy League school but don't we deserve a treat after all the reading we have done this year?  Like William Forrester said on Finding Forrester, "I read the Times for a main dish, and the tabloids for a dessert"  Go on, treat yourself.  Or even better, start an argument against me.  I would love to hear it. -Pat

       I'm 100% in favor of isolating and analyzing those philosophical quotes in the hearts of novels.  My favorite (besides "my mother is a fish") in As I Lay Dying comes from the woman who lays dying.  The quote comes at the end of a chapter that deals with the nature of words- how words and names are used to describe emotions and feelings but they're always insufficient if there isn't first hand knowledge of the experience that the word's trying to describe.  As an example...  "I would think Anse (the name of her husband).  Why Anse.  Why are you Anse.  I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquify and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out the darkness into a vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without life like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgetten the name of the jar.  I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a            and I couldn't think ANSE, couldn't remember ANSE.  It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now (had three kids now).  And when I would think CASH and DARL (the names of her first two children) that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right.  It doesn't matter what they call them.  "And so when Cora Tull would tell me I waas not a true mother, I would thinnk how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sound that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words.  Like Cora who could never even cook."  Sorry for the long intro- but keeping that attitude towards words in mind, comprehend the significance of the quote I really wanted to address.  "One day I was talking to Cora.  She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, (this is the big part) because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, salvation is just a matter of words too."  I read it as questioning a lot of peoples' grasp on religion.  Sinners who believe that sin is just in words miss the meaning of words, miss the meaning of sin.  Addie really does know sin, she has a child from a man outside her marriage and holds resentment towards her whole family as well as God.  I think this is a quote that can have a lot of interpretation, so think about it and post your thoughts.  Love Rob

       Catcher in the Rye is such a comfortable read and a great book that many of us at this age can relate to. Even with Holden's very personal, eclectic ideas, interrupted and day-dreaming like train of thoughts, my brain can somehow feel a connection. And actually this personal and colloquial style is what really makes this book engaging, interesting, and awesome. I feel like I can easily follow Holden's train of thoughts, even when he daydreams from one seemingly unrelated topic to another. That's just how the human brain thinks. Salinger constructed such a real, believable teenager figure.  Finally, as Paul advertised so nicely, besides the great New York Times, there is also the great magazine New Yorker everyone should read. Especially in the May 23rd edition in which there was the famous article "The Gray Zone" written by Seymour Hersh probing the secret interrogation agencies and facillities that were in widespread use. All of these abuses we are witnissing today directly relates to the intentional or unintentional commands from the Pentagon (including Rumsfeld himself). But yeah, read this famous article "The Gray Zone" by Seymour Hersh.

       Holden reminds me a lot of someone who's eyes aren't open to the real world.  He's had his life handed to him by his parents, and no doubt while he loves them a lot of his frustrations are coming from a lack of direction.  He's been directed all his life and he struggles to be who he wants to be.  Because he's never worked for anything he doesn't understand the value of anything and throws away his extremely valuable education and life his well to do parents have given him.  He judges people and fails to make successful relationships because he's placed arbitrary value in some unimportant things.  However I feel Holden has a kind heart, and that counts for a lot.  He's simply, uninformed to say the worst, and is a bit odd.  For me, the character makes sense, and I do find the book extremely memorable, much more so than many other novels I've read.  I find the conciseness of the book commendable, Orwell's philosophy of saying what you need to say without the fluff is philosophy now too.

       I actually really like the prompts that we have for the writing assignment, they give a lot to write about. I am going to write a parody on Catcher in the Rye, the book itself provides a lot of ideas to write about.  I think one of the major problems with olden is in his believe that people do things for the wrong reasons: not because it's what they want to do, but because it's what everyone else wants them to do. He expresses it in this quote about lawyers: "Even if you did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys' lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over...?" And I find that to be true for myself, I sometimes wonder if I want to go to a great school like Harvard just because it's a famous school and it will look good on my resume or because I believe that I will actually learn better and enjoy studying there; I have to admit though that often the answer is: I like the name a lot, sounds big and important:(   I was also looking at this quote by Mr. Antolini in the book : "If you go along with it [academic edu.] considerable distance, it'll give you an idea what size mind you have. What it'll fit and, maybe, what it won't. After a while you'll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing." I just happen to really disagree with this quote, just because I am against any kind of parameters set on a human mind and consciousness, I believe that there is no limit to our ability to learn and understand new ideas, and so there shouldn't ever be such thing as a "size mind" ... do you like it small, large, or supersize?  I like to analyze different "smart" quotes from books, gives you something to ponder about.

       Ryan, I agree that more guys should read Their Eyes Were Watching God. Men and women have different perspectives on life and think completely differently. However I think Their Eyes Were Watching God allows the reader to get inside the mind of a women and how they view relationships. This could be very benefical for guys that read it to understand how women think... It's also a good book besides that and isn't the "girl power" book you would think it would be. I highly recommend it.

       Pat, I agree with you that Gatsby is a success as a story critical of the society during the 20s, but the only analogy I can make to the book is that of a turkey that is served for Thanksgiving dinner, it doesn't have its feathers and it doesn't look as beautiful as it did when it was alive but it's still a bird, so is this book, it has a story but it lacks the "feathers" - it lacks commentary and reflections of the author; it's just a story with a very interesting plot and a straight-forward message of society being corrupted and fake. And it's true that maybe the story doesn't need the extraneous ornaments but it's just much more engaging to see what the author himself has to say about the story, it creates a conversation as you read the book between you and Fitzgerald.  Rob, sorry but I didn't find AILD yet, so I started on Their eyes were watching God, but I will get to it as soon as I find the book. You should start though on Fountainhead, that book is really hard to read, partly because it has so much philosophy and such a complicated plot in it. But you definitely should read it, I really need someone to discuss it with:(  Discussing Catcher in the Rye today helped a lot, there were a lot of things that I haven't even realized as I read the book, such as for example the fact that Holden ends up in a mental hospital or that he is crazy all along in the story. As I read the book I had this feeling that he was a bit strange, but because the book was written as his own personal thoughts I just took it for normal that his mind wondered all over, I sort of think we all have that in our mind where we think of random thinks during the day once in a while. I also heard a lot of criticism of the character, but I still believe that he is a really nice person that has just come to a state of dissatisfaction with the society around him; he does exaggerate a lot and he seems to be critical of everyone and everything he sees, but it sounds like it all comes from bitterness and depression of his character. Maybe he wants to be a catcher in the rye because he knows that there is no one else to catch him if he were to jump off a cliff. It's strange how the more I think about him the more depressed I become myself. Ducks are lucky, they can just fly away whenever it gets too cold ...

       If love is a battlefield as Pat Benatar famously said, then Their Eyes Were Watching God is a top secret report addressed to the Female Commander that was intercepted and expressed mailed to the Male General.  Zora Neale Hurston writes about a woman named Janie searching for her soul mate and finding a few duds along the way.  In the process, Hurston provides insight into the female perspective in a way I've never encountered.  When women speak of love it seems as though they carefully construct a model of an ideal relationship, but the honest solitude of writing allows Hurston to leak key secrets about the art of war/love.  A recurring metaphor in the novel compares perfect love to the blossom of a pear tree, and through the exploits of Janie, the protagonist, the author defines the love blossom as a relationship in which a man treats a woman as his equal and respects her mind, all the while making her glow from every fingertip and toe. Easier said than done? Absolutely, but Their Eyes chronicles the mistakes of foolish men, writing a virtual how-not-to book on love.  I feel I'm a more complete person after reading it because I attained a deeper understanding of female emotion and compassion.  I believe Their Eyes is a book that should be read by all men because it teaches how women feel and why they feel the way they do, key bits that are rarely divulged and usually left to be deciphered through telepathy, a skill that few of us poor saps are granted.  Zora Neale Hurston's novel may be about encountering womanhood, but it’s a worthwhile read for everyone because it demystifies the differences between the sexes and could possibly save or prevent a future dysfunctional marriage.   -By: Ryan Elliott   PS - I had no idea anyone could think as beautifully as Hurston does in this book

       I'm coming to the end tonight Beck, but there is certainly no doubt in my mind that each one of those Bundren's is crazier than the next.  I certainly enjoyed kickin it w/ you and the crew at Mr. Skyview, and I'd like to commend Divcom for raising 6 g's for Make a Wish Foundation.  Natalya; Fountainhead is Ayn Rand, is it not?  I'll read it if you read AILD and we'll have a two book discussion going on.  Pat, I'm in agreement w/ you about Gatsby.  One of my favorites of the year... I really enjoyed a fictional approach to social commentary.  Not really satire, but 100% effective- a challenge to the alcohol consuming socialites who had lost the traditional values of the turn of the century.  It's a direct insult to those who live that life.  And the whole time there is the allusion to "big brother" with the doctor's eyes.  My take is that although the socialites attempted to cover their moral discrepencies in speakeasies and  private parties, it was clear to everyone what was really going on.  Just a thought, no evidence to back it up, but I think it sounds good.  One month of school left!!!  Love Rob

       Who says The Great Gatsby is a boring book?  I have heard that from countless people who have seen me reading the book and its not true.  The novel, like other successful American Lit. novels, criticizes society through the experiences of a narrator that is a central character in the novel.  The Great Gatsby criticizes the "roaring twenties" by depicting the upper class' lifestyle that consists of breaking prohibition laws, having affairs, and murder.  Throughout the book I felt a sense of this lifestyle that I can only describe as "hollow."  That may not make sense, but it seemed to me as if the novel showed the upper class as not having a role in society, just partying and living a life that didn't have a significant meaning.    Going back to my thought on how this novel is successful due to its criticism of society, I can draw many similairities between this novel and Huckelberry Finn.  Both novels consisted of a central character that had the role of the narrator, both mocked society of the time period, and both novels a relationship between the narrator and another central character that grew as the novel progressed-both resulting in the parting of these two characters at the climax of the novel.    Maybe there are some other thoughts on this novel.....anyone?  -Pat

       Okay, I just finished "the catcher in the rye" and I don't quite know what to make of it. This blog entry will double as somewhat of a discovery process (hopefully) for me and I will hopefully be able to come to some sort of conclusion about some aspect of the book. If I begin to ramble I apologize.  First I'd like to talk about the significance of the title. When his sister asked him what he liked I was anxious to hear his answer. Immediately he ponders some off-the-topic idea and comes back to the topic after his sister says, "You can't even think of one thing." He responds with, "Yes, I can. Yes, I can." He than talks about his brother and the enjoyment he gets out of talking to his sister. These things he comes up with are so simple. Then he tells about how he simply wants to be a catcher in the rye. I like the connection Natalya made with the James Castle and the "catcher" Holden. This seems like one of many intricate connections that Salinger makes. Finally I think the title signifies he wants a simple life with a simple purpose. Now I finally see the connection with his displeasure with "phonies." Phonies to Holden suggest some sort of unneeded attention aimed at bettering the perception other people have on them. This adds to the idea that he wants a simple life that is not fake and that has a purpose. Obviously one can see that being "phony" has no "real" purpose. This contributes to his dislike of the idea.  One thing I noticed was the abrupt conclusions Holden comes to when looking at different situations in his life. It's hard to find examples, a few off the top of my head are: the inferiority complex and the conceited men, the kids always having to meet their friends and the yearbook handsomeness. He even ends his story with a simple conclusion of his.  Hmm... That was somewhat helpful for me. I hope I didn't sound like a rambling idiot. Oh yeah, does anyone see the significance with the ducks? ~Frank

       I'm reading "AILD" as well, Rob, and i quite agree; it is fascinating. Have you got the end yet? It's CRAZY. Sort of.... unexpected anyway. Mrs VA introduced the book by telling us that the Bundren family was simply unintelligent ("really stupid," i think she said) but i've come to a different understanding of them. (No offense to Mrs VA - I was just using you as a handy introduction-type idea). Anse is the only person in the book who strikes me as truley stupid, but i think his stupidity comes from his country stubborness and pride. The rest of them are pretty much just pure crazy as opposed to dumb. Cash pulls through in the end as the sanest of the bunch - too bad his leg is rotted off. I think that Darl's developement is very interesting; his narrations retain some of his characteristic vocabulary, but he is badly cracked by the end. And i see what you're saying (Rob) about Vardaman's run on excitement, but i think it runs right on through to insanity. (conclusion)  -Beck-

       Hey Rob, I am going to start As I lay Dying tomorrow, I'm not sure if we will have any more time for discussions, but I would certainly love to talk about the book. Discussions are great, as long as people are interested in talking about a book.  I personally recommend everyone to read "Fountainhead." Every time I come back to reading this book it elevates me to a totally different level of understanding of life, it's so crazy, it's like a philosophy book but the only philosophy is in the lives of the people that are in the book, I mean it's just great! You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece.  People "die with every day that passes. When you meet them, they're not what you met last. In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves. They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass."

Having read both Gatsby and Catcher, I find it kind of fun to play along as you get to know Holden and slowly resent 20's life.  Right now I'm reading As I Lay Dying, and it's like nothing I've ever read before.  The style is insanely unique (albeit a little difficult to get used to) as Faulkner switches narrators from one miserable member of the Bundren family to another with each passing chapter.  Faulkner gives real personality to the characters not by description, per se, but by narrating  as they think.  For instance, Vardaman is the youngest of the characters,  and his narration is distinct for his simple vocab and run on sentences that accurately depict the excitement of a child.  Darl on the other hand is viewed as a deep thinker so his vocab is more expansive and Faulkner really tries to play around with language and philosophy under the pretense of death.  While I rejoice that my classmates enjoy their respective novels, I'm slightly disappointed I have but one compatriot that can share the sentiments of my novel.  If you have some free time this summer, AILD will keep your mind engaged.  Keep up the great work as the instinctual countdown in your brains approaches june 23!  Love Rob

       Hey Nova, thanx for joining us, it's been getting rather quiet here lately.... The Great Gatsby is not that great after all, I guess it's just not my kind of "great literature." First I though I was missing something in the book, but now I think that it's the but the book that's missing something... The author states his doctrine on the first page: "whenever you feel like criticizing anyone... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had," which dictates the rest of the book making it "lack" any kind of criticism expressed by the narrator or any "reflections" upon the issues raised by the actions of characters in the book. He simply leaves it all for the reader to interpret and draw her/his own conclusions. I understand that's great in the fact that it makes you think for yourself about what you read instead of just reading off the dogmas that the author provides you with layed out on a silver plate. But my problem is that I need someone to discuss the book with, even if it be the author himself through the context of the "sophisticated sentences" he writes down in his book, or his thoughts.   That's why I think I liked Catcher in the Rye so much more, the author just told you everything he thought, even though all the digressions could sometimes get distracting. It's strange how the book just gives you three days of this boy's life but you know everything about his character you could ever find out. I first thought he was rather sardonic and just negative in general toward life and people, all of his comments and criticism, but toward the end of the book I couldn't help but love this boy. The way he just tells his little sister how he wants to be a catcher in the rye.. "standing on the edge of some crazy cliff... I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff...I have to come out from somewhere and catch them..." and just makes you feel like you know that he would have caught that boy that jumped out of the window and that he would have kept that young girl from selling her body and that he would have donated all of his money to those two nuns if he could... just the simple things he says and does make him so unrealistically true and "good"... I am trying though to figure out what is the significance of the carousel at the end of the book... why does it make him so happy?

       Hello all.  It's Nova.  How is everyone's book going for them?  The Great Gatsby is pretty good.  I thought it would be boring but I actually got into the story, although some parts of it were confusing.  The people in our discussion group were having a hard time trying to figure out Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.  Does he represent God?  Nick?  Or just a random billboard, watching everything?  Anyone have any ideas?  Also, we had a group consensus that we dislike Tom and Mrs. Wilson (well, mostly a consensus).  I have to go, but I'll come back later! Bye

       Like Corey, I am also reading Their Eyes Were Watching God.  I really enjoy reading it. It's more relaxing of a read opposed to having to analyze a piece for rhetorical strategies.  It's nice to have no pressure after the AP tests and be rewarded for spending the first three fourths of the year challenging ourselves and preparing for the "big test."

       The blog's been rather quiet lately.  I'm finding the catcher in the rye an easy and memorable read.  I personally find the characters very realistic, especially Holden, I enjoy how the entire book is simply living the life of somebody who's our age, but engrossing simply because Salinger paints such an accurate portrait.  But I'm not hearing unanimous agreement from others, since people in my small group are finding different views of the book.  But what's really on my mind isn't the catcher in the rye, for me it's the aftermath of the ISEF fair.  Aside from meeting kids who I'm sure will be extremely successful before they're 30, I saw a group of 4 of them on my favorite business commentator's show, Lou Dobbs, talking about their projects tonight.  I wish I could accomplish as much as they have already.  I'm having the hardest time finding a good idea which real practical applications.  Getting started is always hardest but I digress.  I just feel like there is so much any of us could be accomplishing and I hate feeling like a sponge.  But there's always next year!  Or this summer I should say!  -Read a real newspaper, go to www.nytimes.com

       Hey everyone whats up?  I like how we are ending the year with fun reading and basic skills about research and other things, after taking the AP test it should be this way.  I am reading Their Eyes were Watching God, it is a really good book and I highly reccomend it, because it's a story that tells of a woman who had tough relationships, and you may know people like this girl, and eventually meets this awesome guy named Tea Cake, I mean with a name like that why wouldn't you want to read the book.  -Corey Furin-

       I personally think everyone should congratulate Rob for his 2nd place at MUN this Saturday! He really did a  great job and it is thanx to him that our team got all the first places:) And I invite everyone to join our club, you never know what hidden talents you have.   Going on to Gatsby, I see the irony of Gatsby's "friends" not even coming to his funeral and the fact that his beloved Daisy runs off and he has to pay for her mistake with his own life. The scenes of the party in his house are truly what the 20s were like for the elite and give me just a general visual of pigs partying in dirt, a feeling of disgust. Also disturbing is the fact that Tom's mistress Myrtle is like that puppy he bought for her on the street, and that he can throw her away as easily as that puppy. I loved the description of women of that time as elegant and mysterious which then created a special contrast with their greed for money and superficial expression of love. I mean I see a lot of themes going on in the book and they are quite obviously related to materialism, but it feels like there is something missing in it, like it's too easy or maybe I just expected too much from the book after hearing all these great things about it. I liked the book, but I don't feel like it changed my life or like it is a masterpiece of literature.

       Hey Rob, in response to your welcome to me as to returning to the "real world", I have a few words to say. Forgive me if I sound like a nerdy bigot here.  First of all, I have to say that yes, certainly, I've got your note you so graciously left on my exhibit booth. I have to thank with my deepest appreciation to all and everyone who came to visit Intel ISEF on Thursday or Friday.   With all the scientific jargons EVERYWHERE in the beloved ISEF exhibits hall that would probably intimidate a good deal of people just with their first step into the ISEF exhibit hall, yes I do agree the environment I was immersed in for the past whole week is out of touch with the "rest of the society". But on a different note, we had the wonderful opportunity to meet people from ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.....We were chatting about not just what scientific discoveries, methods, projects we worked on over the past years, but we ISEF finalists also discussed politics (yeah discussing politics with people from other countries is kinda interesting), our hometowns, schools, and just our personal nerdy lives in general. We also have had LOTS AND LTOS OF SOCIAL LIFE....more social life in the past week than I've ever had in my life. Just being in the convention center makes you feel more mature, and everything was in adult settings and business attires. All the strict rules, politeness, civilness in conjunction with meeting professors, Nobel Laureates, leading scientists and teachers of all fields that represent modern society. True, all of these cameras, press, Nobel laureates are probably very special, but these famous people (both adults and ISEF students) I met do constitute part of our world and the contributions of the scientists is what move the society forward, not the verbatim politicians. Besides, I'd rather be in a environment of overly academicness, formalness, and overly famous people to see what really the world of brainpower is like than be in an environment that encourages some kind of phobia to academia and modern sciences (We had some fun times chuckling and making fun of Bush on the bureaucracy and the political barriers to modern science advances, such as the stem cell research, and it was started by Nobel Laureates) YEAH SO ISEF ALL THE WAY....5000 times more REAL WORLD! lol.   And now I'm looking forward to catch up all the work I've missed the past week lol. Catcher in the Rye seems to be a very comfortable reading right now. I've looking forward to discussing the book with other interested readers.

       Wow, it's been a few days since I last checked the blog and I feel so out of touch... so I have some preambulatory clauses to address before I get to the real, English-related topic of the post.  First and foremost, I'd like to  CONGRATULATE the members of Skyview MUN for their various awards and other successes at the district tournament this weekend, RECOGNIZING the efforts of the Russian Federation in successfully warding off the political opposers of the Rodina FURTHER RECOGNIZING that said efforts resulted in both best team in General Assembly as well as best team overall and, LOOKS FORWARD TO seeing the big ass trophy that results  I really had a good time and look forward to participating in the future.  Secondly, Thomas, welcome back to the real world.  I hope you got my note when I went to visit you and you weren't there, but if you didn't, I came to support the scientific mind Natalya has recognized as a Hottie.  Now to the Great Gatsby... I feel like a major nerd here, but I really enjoyed the book and feel I was able to track the author and accompanying symbolism.  (This is where I feel like a nerd)  I would therefore like to reference the independent reading report I did on it earlier on in the year; 	  The Great Gatsby is considered the great American novel because below the cloak of an extravagant love story is the erosion of American society in the Roaring 20’s, or “Jazz Age,” as Fitzgerald dubbed it.  Gatsby himself is the symbol of the American dream as Fitzgerald saw it:  he’s rich and therefore a socialite, he throws lavish parties where hundreds of “friends” come to his mansion to glorify the vices of society, namely alcohol and sex, and he pursues unrealistic fantasies on a whim, attempting to bend reality to fit his sensibilities.  Gatsby’s love interest, Daisy, is respectable and accountable, besides being desirable.  When Gatsby tries to woo Daisy, and runs into obstacles, it is apparent in Gatsby’s demeanor that the American lifestyle is unraveling, as demonstrated in his cessation of party hosting.  In the end, when Gatsby’s protection of Daisy results in his death, it is apparent at his funeral when none of his “friends” come to mourn how the American lifestyle is truly viewed; as base, vile, and taboo.  Long story short, Gatsby was symbolic of the twenties life-style, (as AP US History should have taught you) a life-style that Fitzgerald was against.  Viewing Gatsby as an embodiment of the Roaring 20's may alter your position toward him and his actions as you read.  Some other interesting symbolism was the role of the Green Light that was Gatsby's hope in reuniting with Daisy, and the role of the Dr.'s Eyes.  I really really enjoyed Gatsby, so if anyone who is reading it wishes to discuss it extracurricularly, I'd love to participate.  I'd also like to note that Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an entirely different style than I believe I've encountered before, and the humor and complexity of the book make it a lot of fun as well.  I love that post AP test, there is still so much interest in American Lit.  Love Rob

       HEY MS.VA AND ALL MY AP ENGLISH FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!  I just would like to say that Thomas Chen had had the wonderful opportunity to experience through one of the best week in his life. Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is truly world class and the experience once in a life opportunity.  The awards and free stuff we got were only a temporary excitement, but the most valuable experience was making great friends from all 50 states and 40 countries around the world!!!!!! It's 100% probable that one or two friends you make in ISEF will be in the future leaders of the world, billionaires, or Nobel Laureates. The country and state pin exchanges, the plethora of ISEF ceremonies, all the social events were truly amazing. Furthermore, we the ISEF competitors got to be in a press like room with the Nobel Laureates as a panel. We were like the press asking the prestigious Nobel Laureates questions and they would answer us right there. It was truly astounding.   Yeah I guess the most important idea I've learned and experienced through this ISEF event is that seriously, there are sooooooooooooooo much talents and brainpower out there in the world, even with the everyday person around us. The project I did was just one grain of sand morphed into this vast lake of sand dunes stretching thousands of miles.  All the 1400 projects there were simply impressive.  I wil see everyone on Monday.   Thomas Chen

       I agree with you Natalya. The ending of "The Great Gatsby" left me hanging also. I feel like I missed some hidden messages or themes. Mr. Selby, my ASL teacher, said he loved the book and that it made such an impact on him... Yeah, I think I'm missing something. I liked Fitzgerald's imagery throughout the book. It was really amazing. There were some very beautiful passages. I need to do some discussing with my group.

       I just got back from the Talent Show and I was really impressed by the last song by the White Bros, piano and violin really made it just ... special, so props for Ben Perry and Matt Wu. Sorry Rob, but Matt WU is way hotter than Thomas, although I have to agree that Thomas by all parameters is qualified for the title of a hottie.  I just finished "The Great Gatsby" today and I have kind of mixed feelings toward the book. I have heard a lot of people say good things about it and on the back of the book it says "American masterpiece" but my question is: what is the point of the book? I just feel dumb right now cause I didn't really find an actual point, or an underlined message or some "truth" or a "revelation." The book was really well written and was engaging, I thought it was great from the very beginning, but I somehow expected more from it and I guess the end just threw me off, as if Fitzgerald just left the book unfinished. I didn't even get it first that the last page I read was the last page of the book, I expected a "to be continued..." So I am really looking forward to a discussion of the book as soon as everyone has finished it, meanwhile Catcher in the Rye seems quite interesting, I like its colloquial style and a somewhat humorous tone, the author is great in his ability to delineate a very vivid and a realistic picture of this boy, I like the beginning: "I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened..." a nice start for the book, sort of sets you up in the right mood ... enjoy the show ... .

       I was certainly happy to hear absolutely no strange Skyview news on Monday morning.  After a big weekend like prom, I always wonder...will we be having an emergency faculty meeting?  Thankfully the answer was no.  I'm glad last week's presentations and class discussions made an impact on you.  Let the message stick.  I have been so pleased to see how well you've all supported each other through AP testing.  You have worked hard and applied yourselves, and through that process, you've been united by a shared goal.  Hang onto this; let your mutual respect for each other be the prevalent theme of your senior year.  The worst part of high school is living with the horrid restrictions that come from cliques; if you can see past those imagined lines, you won't need to live your life with a countdown.  I encourage you to come to school each day with the intent to build relationships so that by the time your ten or twenty year reunion rolls around, you'll genuinely want to go and can show up in a non-inebriated state.  Thanks, everyone, for your honest evaluations of class.  The consensus of the group was that it would have been helpful to have seen practice exams earlier in the year in order to have some context for our topics of study.  I also realized--far too late--that I could have made our SOAPS/Tone analysis more relevant for you by asking you to write essays that incorporated it.  I made the assumption that this was something you already knew, but Natalya's posting made it clear that this was something she (and probably most) had to discover.  My guess is, though, that many people haven't made this connection.  So...I know what I can do to improve.  This brings up an interesting observation in response to Thomas' posting about teachers and students.  Teachers think they're invaluable...students think they can independently learn everything they need...I believe that neither is true.  Bad teachers limit good students...A teacher can only be as good as students allow her to be. The best classrooms exist where everyone realizes that mutual responsibility is necessary.  So, as always, thanks for coming in with curiosity and a good work ethic.  As for you, Thomas...IF you have time to read and think about Catcher in the Rye, here's what you need to know.  Sydney Clos, Mina O'Brien, Matt Goosen, Mitch Amort, Chris Tamura and Tyson Cecka have signed up to read the book.  I assume you have Tyson's e-mail.  If so, find out what his group has decided upon for their reading schedule.  Wednesday and Friday will be discussion days.  On Friday, students will be turning in their book notes, which can be written in journals.  (Obviousely, you can turn in your work late.  We'll talk when you return to school.) The directions are on the syllabus.  Do you still have it?  If not, let me know and I'll get the directions to you.  We're thinking of you with pride every day!  The air circulation system has turned off and I'm starving.  Time to go.  See you all tomorrow!  Mrs. V-A

       I just wanted to tell Thomas how hot he was in his Oregonian picture.  With that kind of outward sex appeal I'm amazed that he hasn't pursued a full-time science t-shirt modeling gig.  I know that however hired him would have a customer in me for sure!  Good luck Tom and Skyview in the ISEF comp!  By the way, Catcher in the Rye isn't for everyone, if you don't like it from the start, you might want to switch because it doesn't change much.  However, some people REALLY identify with the desperate feeling of not quite fitting in with the world.  The book didn't grab me like Gatsby did, which I really enjoyed, but As I Lay Dying needs some love too, so far it's me and Kailie V and I'd like some people to share with, so think about it.  Love Rob

       Hi this is Thomas Chen posting from a HUGE GIGANTIC computer lab inside the Oregon Convention Center. Everything is going well so far,and it's an awesome place here, although I'm feeling the PRESSURE of this immense Intel ISEF competition more and more.  I had a wonderful chance already to meet people from all around the country and the world, and I have collected emblems from most states of the US and over a dozen other countries via the student pin exchange program.  I'm still assuming we are doing the book group. And Mrs.VA, I've decided to read "Catcher in the Rye". So I just need to know my book group and our agendas and plans for the week, such as what's the project all about; book notes; other works and preparations? Keep posting on the blog and keep me informed through the week.  See ya all next week.

       Just looking back at this year all I can say is that it flew by fast, way too fast to even realize that the junior year is gone... well almost gone. I think senior year will go by even faster, the more you have going on in your life the faster it seems to flow, every day is inundated with just ... life! I just have this analogy in my head: h.s. is like our salmon creek, college is like an Amazon, and after that it's an ocean, and hopefully you get into the warm current;) I am personally looking forward to the end of h.s., I just want to go out into "real" life and be sort of extricated from the feeling of being trapped in this tiny box, cause life just has so much more volume to it than we can actually see right now. I think college should be awesome, better classes, more people to meet, better professors, just feeling like you are your own person and you can do anything you want with your life. Actually when I was at Stanford our tour guide told us that students there can get as drunk as they want and have as many parties as they want as long as they don't bother anyone and don't get out of the dormitories, I think that's in a way a safer way to drink if you do drink than going out to the woods "camping." I missed the accident scene yesterday and the assembly today, but I also would like to think VA for talking to us about this issue today, it just makes it so much more personal and real when you talk about it, and I love it how our teacher actually cares about us. Really, thank you.

       I just wanted to say that I think we had a really good discussion today third period.  It was only some of us, but it was really really nice to talk about current issues within our country with other people my age, and Mrs. VA of course.  I really enjoyed it.

       I just wanted to commend Mrs. VA on a drunk-driving presentation that connected better with me than the pseudo-accident or marathon assembly.  Personal relationships are what have the most influence on peoples' lives, no matter how much pop-culture goes into an assembly.  So this weekend be safe, sober if possible, but if you do choose to drink, remember to have a plan, and that drunk-driving is NEVER the best alternative, or acceptable at all.  Once again, great job AVA, have fun but be safe!  Love, Rob  OH, by the way, Thomas mentioned some independent reading?  Could anyone fill me in on what that will entail?  And while I'm having after-thoughts, good luck to everyone that's taking their AP History tests tomorrow.  Happy Review!

       I just wanted to say that i was quite impressed with the whole 15 minutes thing. The crowd was quiet and respectful in both the commons and the parking lot and there weren't too many jokes cracked later on that day. Either something of the message got through to the general mob or i have greatly underestimated their intelligence. ...well, probably the former of those two options.   I also wanted to thank Mrs VA for the discussion we had in third period. First perioders truely missed out.   hmmm, that was oddly written. Oh well. --beck

       After two AP tests, I'm absolutely DYING to discuss some multiple choice questions... please!  Somebody!  Did you get D. on question 28 or A. on 17?  All this anti-cheating just sounds like a challenge to me.  So here's the plan for u.s., we all fabricate test booklets, replace them with the real booklets when our booklets get picked up, and mail the originals back to the College Board.  Our goal is to have to take next year's tests in facilities with prison-like security.  We'll call it operation Rebel Yell.  Anyway, one day you'll look back at high school and just admire your naievity and such, and you'll be pleasantly nostalgic, at that point you'll buy yourself a Harley and hit the road for a couple months.  As soon as H.S. ends I'll be anticipating my mid-life crisis (maybe crises), because maturity and responsibility are WAY overrated.  ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS!  Carpe Dium!  Much love to all bloggers for making MY h.s. experience memorable  Love, Rob

       I don't know about all of you, but I'm REALLY REALLY GLAD High School is almost over................It's time for the real college lifelong challenges. Although I have to admit that I've learned and experienced sooooooo much in the last three years.  And Here is a little vivid memory from my three days of AP tests in as many days: "Remember, the Multiple Choice questions may NEVER be discussed in any shape or form with ANYONE at ANYTIME, failure to do so may result in the invalidation of grades and possible legal actions for COPYRIGHTS VIOLATION!"  Yeah you realize from the AP test experience how much your mind has been trained to memorize stuff........because i've literally memorized the whole AP instruction script by now.   I'll see all you guys tomorrow, the only day I'll be in school for two weeks.

Thomas you're stress level must be through the roof and Rachel that must have been the most fun you've ever had. Hmmmm... Sarcasm. My mind is still spewing literary terms. Ah almost time to sleep.

That double test experience must've eclipsed any academic strenuous activity you've ever accomplished in your life. I can't even imagine how I would survive because I just went home and slept.  For me, the continued stress hormone pumper is still pumping strong doses into my brain, for I have four more AP tests to go, three MORE this week......Yeah I'm begging myself that hopefully I can survive like you guys too.. And have a happy stress relieving time in English class the next two weeks!

       Yeah wow... I can't even describe this feeling right now... Chad can understand what I'm talking about. After enduring about 10 hours of testing today and now having it all over.  It's undescribable.  The English test itself wasnt too bad, I think I anticipated it to be much worse, considering the practices seemed to be much more difficult than the test itself.  Also, what a relief that one of the essay prompts wasnt based on a passage.  I hope everyone else felt that they did well... Congrats on surviving the AP experience.

Seems like I haven't done anything significant and it's already over......Yeah it's time to have a moment of silence........To honor all the three years of learnings we had that prepared us for this exam.  Anyways, how did everyone else feel about the test? (Remember, NEVER discuss Multiple choice questions.......lol).

       I was reading the free response essays and scoring commentaries that Thomas posted a link to and I just had a revelation: there is a purpose to SOAPS! No really, most people that got 9s or 8s used the SOAPS method, they talked about the subject (themes and ideas), occasion for the writer to write addressing this subject(s), audience whom he/she addressed, what purpose the author had when writing this piece and style of the writing including tone and rhetorical strategies. Now after two years of thinking that soaps is a waste of time I finally come to a conclusion that it is really the best way to organize your thinking and to make sure that you include everything in your essay in order to score all the possible "points." I tend to just randomly name facts as I go, mentioning the style, occasion and everything in a mix, but I think putting info in a coherent and organized manner will show the scoring person that you actually know what you are talking about, you can express in a very erudite and orderly manner and you are not just brain- storming. So my another suggestion is practice soaps, just look at some of the essay prompts on the link Thomas gave us and as you read each one of them jot down just a couple of words for SOAPS that you think you might have used if you were writing the essays at the exam.  Or better yet, relax and forget all about the test until 7:30 on Monday morning:)

       Hey Frank, go here  urlLink AP Central's English Language and Composition past essay prompts. , although you need a collegeboard Login (Which it's good and very helpful to have one).  Here is an EXCELLENT article from "KidSource Online"  urlLink that provides insights into students' attitudes in schools with survey statistics and some common misconceptions. All students and especially teachers should take the time to read this article .   This statement below from that article is VERY true:    Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement:   Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.

       Hey Everyone, I'm having a blast here at UDUB.......I was wondering, since I missed the last three days of school, did anyone who's taking AP Lit next year get a  specific "summer reading list" or summer work that we have to accomplish before september? ......Just curious, otherwise have an awesome summer! And as Rob mentioned, keep blogging THomas

       Hey All MY AP ENGLISH BUDDIES!  Today's my last day of school........I'm going up to UW for six weeks. I have to say that this year has been an awesome year in VA's AP English class. Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially.   So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced.   Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class!  FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!!  Best Wishes  Thomas Chen

       I have been injected with some sort of spirit now that the only things left to do in English are sign yearbooks and watch Ferris.  Thanks Mrs. VA for an awesome year and such a simple yet appropriate pair of final prompts.   As far as school spirit goes this last year was not only unprecedentend and uncharacteristic of Skyview, it was also PHENOMINAL.  The key was a group of kids, mostly seniors but several juniors and sophomores as well that were willing to set aside their images (rip up their cool cards *wink*) and have fun with outfits, chants, and the good feeling they got when Skyview won.  If we want to have that kind of a fall and winter sports season again it's going to take some leadership.  Kids quickly forget how much fun it is to get G'd UP from the feet up and yell at Prairie high school, but all it takes is a key figure like Jake Valentine this year to really motivate kids.  Cheerleaders keep up the good work, but help is needed to generate school-wide spirit.  Everybody keep blogging this summer!  I'm pretty sure we'll have a summer reading list so we can talk about that, but with each passing day, November draws closer.  Love Rob

       So this is a really exciting blog, so I've decided to spice it up a bit...or at least try. I don't know if anyone has noticed, but our school generally lacks school spirit. I admit, last year was AMAZING compared to every other year I have been at Skyview, but there is still room for improvement. During cheerleading practice we were discussing different ways to implement more school spirit throughout Skyview. However, it's going to take a lot more than just 15 girls out on the sideline.  If anyone has any good ideas of how to get more of the student body involved, blog away! It will be greatly appreciated and we can have a super fun year next year being the old men (and women) on campus! Rachel Penny

       It's very true that we don't realize our milieus until we move away from them.  When I moved up here from North Carolina, there was something different.  I couldn't really describe what it was, but something in the personalities of people.  There are pretty much the same restaraunts, stores and things to do around here as there are in most areas, so i could never figure out exactly what was different.  Then I figured it out. It's the people.  For the most part, people living in the Northwest are more "natural." Like Seattle is known for being artsy, and Portland is more of a naturalist area.   Also, the first thing I noticed when I moved was the California pride.  I never understood what was so special about California. Maybe it was just being in middle school when everyone is trying to find themselves by bragging about everything possible, but California always came up as a bragging right.  It was amazing to me how many people were like, "well I'm from California!" My response was always was "your point is...?" To this day I have yet to figure out what is so special about California. Yes, it has great weather for the most part of the year, which is more than I can say for here, but I couldn't see myself just packing up my bags and moving down there.  Even given the opportunity to, I declined to move to sunny So. Cal.  Which brings up a whole nother aspect of milieu.  Families. You would be surprised how completely different people live.  Having my mom move down to California this past summer, I was completely excited to move in with the Gilfoys. Even though they seemed like a "normal" family.  I realized there is no "normal" family. (Kind of like there are no "normal" people, like Thomas stated.) I always thought that I just lived in the most "interesting" family, but every family has something different about them. After moving in with them, I have realized many small things that I love about my own family and how differently I used to live.  I guess it's kind of like leaving my family a couple years early.  Next year when most of you go off to college you think you will never miss your family and you're dying to get out of your house. Getting out of the house will be great, but trust me though, you will miss them and all of the small things, especially your own mother's cooking.  -Rachel Penny

       Ok, this blog needs to be spiced up once again. So what did everyone think of the great and rather humorous documentary?   First of all, in the film so often you'll see all the "weird" cultures, and the people in these communities/sect will be so proud of their culture and heritage and religious practices.   To go off on Mrs.VA's commment that "we don't see our own milieu when we are living in it", I believe this statement to be mostly true. If a person has never moved to a different state/country, then that person will always see himself as a "normal" human being, because they are so immersed in their culture in which they were born. But when you move, that's when you will discover your milieu, and when you move to a drastically different place you also can more objectively see the milieu of your new home. That happened to me several times already, first the culture shock when I moved from China to California, and then I then I brought an interesting mix of Chinese/California culture when I moved up here to Vancouver Washington.   Here is just a list of the many many milieus of Vancouver, if you don't realize already:  1:As Erin mentioned: "ALL THE SUBARUS AND SUVS!!!!!!"(this is a very interestiing discovery as I moved here, I guess even Georgia has much less SUVs) 2:Ski and Snowboarding Crazy(Go figure with all the outdoor opportunities here) 3:People drive soooooooo painfully slow and very carefully obeying the speed limit(Compare to California....You'd be kidding if you sped just 10mph above the speed limit....in California 50 mph 5 lane highway completely jammed with 80mphers) 4:People very much obey the law, the society as a whole is a lot more strict and calmer.(People very rarely question authority here, I can elaborate on that later).  5:The society's pace is soooooooooooo slow(downtown stores close before dark, what???? that's unbelievable in california) 6:I've never heard the word "Spendy" before I moved to Washington 7:Fast food dominates(somehow people are ok with fastfoods here) 8:All these wetlands and storm drainages(which of course the "rain milieu" of washington) And there are many many more.............Milieus and these subtle differences of cultures are what's so unique about every place, everyone of us......Catch a glimpse of New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Honolulu, Victoria(BC)......Wow what a range of different milieus.   Too often have I heard people calling each other "you are not normal", or people urging me to "just being a normal person". But I will often ask back, "what do you mean by NORMAL?". "How do you define normal????" Because "a normal" human being is different in each culture/country, and you have to have a firm grasp of the milieus of that culture to be normal. Like people will always see me tapped on with Chinese culture, even if I realize it or not. And I will not try to act like everybody else just because I want to look like "a normal person", because THERE IS NO NORMAL PERSON, especially in America.   The immigration and custom scene where people from all corners of the world feeling all patriotic and excited to become an American Citizen is simply a phenomenal picture patented for America. After all, America is a country founded on uniquenesses and differences and immigrants and we continue to pride ourselves for that. And thus in America, the world "normal" is moot and there is simply NO NEED FOR NORMAL! America has always to protrude out from the world as NOT BEING NORMAL!!!!!! In the land of the free, uniqueness is happiness; And differences drive our country forward;

       Nostalgia as a whole is vastly underrated.  Advertisors recognize its potential, filling ads with subliminally old soundtracks that put you in a good mood for being 19 once.  Nostalgia is all around.  People take pictures so they can look back 20 years from now and remember how good they looked in that sweater, or what they barbequed that fourth of July.  I myself enjoyed my own dose of nostalgia going to a concert by the Presidents of the United States of America.  They were super popular in elementary schoo with hits like Lump, Kitty, and Peaches, but took an 8 hear hiatus (sp?) at the height of their popularity.  They've reunited and played at the Rose Festival for the glorious price of FIVE DOLLARS.  I had a great time, and so did several non-blogging peers.  They played all their hits, some new ones (yay!) and even covered some Beatles, Sex Pistols, and Video Killed the Radio Star.  Rick White said it best.  I always loved PUSA, but I never dreamed I'd finally see them my senior year of High School.  Somehow I think it will be a memory he sure as hell won't forget.  Love, Rob

       I too fondly remember a time when I could fit both legs into a single pantleg of my size 30 waist JNCOs in the 4th grade.  I also remember the furious discussions with my father after covering them in grass stains playing football at recess.  It is an era I will forever remember with a twinge of longing in my heart.  I believe the same will be true once I exit high school.  In the elementary years all my friends and I could think about was reaching middle school, and now I wish I had savored those moments.  Understanding this time conundrum, I refuse to make the same mistakes twice.  Not even in the most boring, drawn out day of high school will I ever say “Man, I wish I was in college,” because I know I’ll blink my eyes and be a forty year old man sitting in a recliner in my underwear with a beer on the table and a hand in my drawls as an homage to Al Bundy.  For a seventeen-year-old that is a terrifying thought and one I’m not ready to accept, but that day is point B, and fortunately I’m still at point A.  But unlike my 11-year-old self, this time I’m going to enjoy the journey.  Today I still wear size 30 waist pants, only they fit a little differently.   -Ryan  PS – Pat and Ryan – stunning resemblance, but I think it’s Alf, (Alien Life Form)

       Pat I have to thank you for that shout out.  But i do have to condone you because Alf is spelled with fa "f" and not a "ph", if youre going to post about Alf get it right. I have had some friends in the past month bring up this fact that i do resemble Alf the tv icon.  i think its great and will make sure that this never dies.  Another thing i want to add is i loved your little peace on JNCO.  i was one of the unfortunate kids and never did have a pair because my parents thought they were hideous, but i envied everyone that had a pair.  --Alf

       First of all, praise to all of you who went to see harry potter, my respect for you is boundless.  It's interesting to hear the feedback from the movies, so no one else was disappointed that it didn't show Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup....I was im not going to lie about it.  Yeah Yeah, the movie couldn't be that long....but why not?  Anyone who goes to see the movie most likely has some interest in the book so they will not mind staying in the theatre an extra half hour to see some vital parts of the book. I am not saying I didn't enjoy the movie-it was quality, I am just saying I stayed up till 3:30 to see a movie and it didn't even have quite possibly one of the most important parts of the book in it.  So ya, enough about that. Now that thats over with, I would like to give a shout out to Ryan Vasbinder for his stunningly real portrayal of Alph, the TV icon, in the late 80's and early 90's.

           What's every person here thinking about Clark's party? It'd be cool, and I'll certainly enjoy sending her off. I liked having her as a teacher. I'll miss VA more though (if you're reading Mrs. VA, someone's paying me to say this). It's been great having her two years straight and seeing my writing grow, as well as having her watch the progression and help me through it. I know that there's some of you who've had her for three years and are ready for a new teacher, and I see your point. I find it interesting the difference between last year and this year. It's a difference which struck me when I was looking for stuff to write my PDP's on. I'm glad how she conducted the class this year; it was very worth while.      Poor Alex is right here next to me. It's Clark's 2nd period, and she still can't access either one. I'm guessing that all of you are very ready to just leave. The will to work is leaving, and I really just don't want to do to much. I'm ready to hop that plane to Germany, head off to my summer concerts, not as ready to do side work (but will somehow), and just slide into next year. It won't be so easy, especially all this college stuff, but I'm ready to start anew with senior year. I really just want to throw away all the college stuff that isn't Washington; I'm not really interested in leaving the state, and I'm even less interested now. It's not smart to trash the stuff yet, but sometimes I don't want to be smart.      Anywho, I'm going to check scholarships or the US blog. Till next time - Adios and God bless.

       For someone who has never read Harry Potter, never seen Harry Potter, not because I don't like them, I've just never been interested, the latest movie was very entertaining.  I've finally picked up the sorcerer's stone, which I think is the first book(someone tell me) that has been sitting on my shelf for an eternity and decided to read it so I think that's telling about the movie.  I enjoyed it, definately a visual feast and fun.  Even not knowing the background the story was simple enough to understand.  Is that kid who had the blonde hair and was a little biatch in the first 2 movies?

       I have also seen the new Harry Potter.  Although some people are disappointed in the movie, I thought it was actually good.  There is no way they would be capable of putting the entire book into a movie.  However, if I hadn't read the books, some parts would have been a little bit confusing.  The only disappointment I had with the movie was that they never really explained the map in full detail.  If you are they type of person who only goes to see the movies, or if you just haven't been caught up in the HP frenzy, then I highly suggest you read the books. The movies are good but they would never be able to give the books the justice they deserve. The first book takes a while to get into, but it is definitly worth the energy. Rachel Penny

       I spent the entire weekend basically watching Godfather, and thus coming to a conclusion that I am in love with Al Pacino and that therefore I shall go to a cloister unless I meet a prince on a white horse who will be an identical twin of Al, but preferably a couple of years younger (about 40...). Al Pacino is the greatest actor in the history of man and is a true inspiration. After watching the first two movies I was going to resign as the KGB princess sure that my destiny is to become a mafia godmother, but with all my regret I have to admit that the third movie sort of disillusioned me with the tragic life of mafiosi families, so thus I decided to stay in KGB for a while and then maybe go to a monastery once I am too old to search for my prince Al Pacino's YoungerTwin:( Anyway I encourage all of you who have not seen the movie to see it, believe me that you shall not regret the nine hours of your life spent to see the greatest classic of all time.  I saw HP3 this weekend also and I have to admit that I was very impressed with the new director and that I actually really liked the movie unlike that first two:) I agree with Rob that the movie's main improvement was that it was fast, entertaining and much more like the book. I couldn't believe that it was over so fast though, I want more now:) I think we should open a club in our school, called something like "HP Nerds, Unite!":)

       Bethany, your parody brought me back to the days when I used to live near Seattle with your description of Puget Sound.  After reading your parody, I was reminded of a part in Huckleberry Finn, I don't know if you remember but Mrs. V-A called it the "mini-vacation" or something like that.  It was the scene in Huckleberry Finn where Twain is describing the sun rising over the river.  Your clear and thorough description of the events taking place and the surroundings is what brought me to recollect this scene in Huckleberry Finn.  Also, I applaud you on writing a parody-that can be a lot more challenging than cranking out a compare/comtrast paper.  So, in essence, as a Compton native would say "mad props to you, it was off the hizzle fo shizzle"

       Hey, great action on the blog and I'm sorry I don't have time to post on that right now, but it's 330 in the morning.  I'm up because I saw the greatest wizard/witch-based movie of all time— Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban.  It was my favorite book, but I loved one and two as well and I didn't think the movies had entirely done them justice.  The new one is just that; new.  The new director, Alfonso Cuaron (something like that, he directed Y tu Mama Tambien) did an absolutely fabulous job making some changes that made the first movies lose a little magic (pun intended) compared to the books.  For instance, robes are worn only once that I can recall, being replaced by jeans and sweaters, making the characters more comparable to the muggle adolescents in the audience.  Also, Draco Malfoy, though still hateable, is now a coward in the face of confrontation.  He takes on the role of a character like Wylie Coyote in the fact that he had malicious intentions, yet always ended with a frying pan bent around his face.  Lastly, Pat said that it didn't always follow close to the book.  Don't get it twisted— none of the story was altered, however, in the interest of time, much quidditch is subtracted in place of plot advancement, which is entirely ok, because the foreshadowing is MUCH better orchestrated than in previous movies, making it much MORE like the book in that sense.  If you can't tell, I LOVED IT.  It was funny, fast, and satisfyingly sentimental.  I'll see it again w/ anyone that wants to go.  A word to the wise, I might be a little grumpy with the mere 3 hours of sleep I plan on getting, so if you must talk to me, PLEASE let the topic be Harry Potter.  Kahli Veys was there too, so if she's at school, she too can fill you in on the glory that is HP.  May all your sleeping patterns be much more consistant than mine,  Love Rob

       Umm ya, its about 3:06 in the morning and i just got home from seeing harry potter.  I am seriously tired, but I thought it would be important to blog to share the improvement of the third movie in comparison to the previous two.  Go see it, its better.  It doesn't follow the book as strict as some would like, but it makes for a quality flick.

       Hideeho Bloggeroonies  I same to be borrowing a page from Ned Flanders on that one. What's going one you probably all asleep people? I know that lots o' people are off at that Harry Potter opening, my little sister included.   Bethany, I'd like to read that parody gig sometime, it'd be cool to see. It can take time to write a nice parody, or a nice thing in general. I'm still trying to finish up my Stalin/Spongebob parody (it's almost done, and thank God I finally have an idea for the ending!). It's fun to write these things, and we all have our different styles, and practice makes perfect, so don't worry. Also, true dat about leaning on God. Coming to him makes us realize how stupid materialism, selfishness, etc. can really be, if we take time to be sincere and thoughtful with him.   Speaking of said parody, it's at the center of what I want to do for my senior project. I'd like to direct and produce it next year, try and make it part of a student-written winter one-acts show that we've had in the wings throughout this school year. I know Megan might be interested in writing a piece. My thesis'll center around different styles and methods of directing, but the project is what I'm really interested in. VA really liked that I'm going to do it, and she's been encouraging in telling me to do a project that is important to me. I've worked almost all school year on my play (named Stalinpants = Stalin + Spongebob Squarepants), so it'll be a great way to tie that in to something like senior project. Hope some of you guys might be interesting in trying out next year. We'd love to have you in any of the shows, and Stalinpants specifically has a large cast, so you'd have a nice chance of getting a part.  Anywho, I find it interesting that we've got senior boards next year. I can totally understand though why some juniors last year were quick to decorate themselves and their cars in Senior '04 stuff. It'll be a fun year (pre-nostalgic sigh). Anywho, I'm going get going, and maybe go to bed sometime soon; most likely. Till next time. Adios and God bless.  Tristan the Yeehawman.

       "Anthem" Ayn Rand  "I am. I think. I will.  My hands.... My spirit.... My sky.... My forest... This earth of mine.  It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It is my mind which thinks, and the judgment of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.  Whatever road I take, the guiding star is whithing me, the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me.  I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but  a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no nigher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its on goal. It is its own purpose.  And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peacs and pride.  This god, this one word: "I"

       (Ego translates as "I" from Greek) I have never asked myself that question before, the answer always seemed to be: duh... evil! Of course until... I read the Fountainhead, which I finally finished today and have successfully proclaimed to be my Bible:) Although it is as radical in its ideas as any philosophical book could possibly get, the philosophy is integrated in a great, crazy story of an architect: the greatest egotist alive, a man of highest level of integrity. And here is what he says at his trial before the collectivist/altruist world accusing him of being an egotist:     "The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes.     "From the beginning of history ,the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive.      "The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary. Second-hander declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. No man can live for another.      "Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption.     "Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Men have been taught that it is virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotists in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self.      "The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man - and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men.      "You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in you own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement."     "People are not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion - prestige. They don't say "This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me." The only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. If one doesn't respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others.      "The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation."     "I never think of myself in relation to anyone. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything."     "I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. I am a man who does not exist for others. The integrity of a man's creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society."    "Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Self-sacrificed? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed."

       Hey guys!  So, I know that I'm a little behind the times with the blog, but I just wanted go back to Pat's thing on the essays and sharing them with each other.  I think it's a really good idea, especially for people in the other classes to share essays about the same books.    Anyways...Pat, I thought that your essay was really good.  It reminded me of how materialistic America has become, and we all get swept up in it.  As much as you think you don't, I'm sure that all of you have.  I mean, we all go to Skyview, and none of us seem to be doing that poorly.  I mean, my parents both of decent jobs, we live in a pretty nice house, and we have enough food and clothes and things.  I just throw myself a pity part sometimes, when I go over to a friend's house who lives in Ashley Heights or has a closet full of nice clothes, or wears a different outfit every day...it makes it really hard to be content with what you have and to not be dissatisfied.  But (I'm gonna be religious here), as long as you lean on God, you should never be dissatisfied with what you have.  And that's something that I struggle with, but that your essay reminded me of.  So, thanks Pat.  I wrote a parody, and it's not too bad.  It follows these few pages in "Their Eyes Were Watching God," and it's a really amazing part of the book that I wanted to try to recreate.  It was hard, so I'm not sure how good my parody is.  Read it, see what you think of it!  But I've gotta go.  All of the Junior Project stuff is do tomorrow...I should start.  Bye!  Bethany          Mary looked up at her with hungry eyes, only wanting to listen to the unfolding story of her Mom’s life. Sarah looked around as her eyes slowly took in the summer surroundings.  Bees swimming drunkenly from flower to flower, the sun slowly dipping into the Puget Sound, and the gentle crash of waves on the shore.  She smiled and gazed down at her patient daughter.  Mary’s unanticipated interest in Sarah’s teenage years inspired her to tell her story.      She thought of where to begin, and her eyes glanced heavenwards.  The afternoon sunlight danced through the branches of the weeping willow tree and made playful shadows oh Mary’s excited face.  Sarah sighed with content, and decided to begin at the time when she first imagined that maybe she wasn’t a little girl anymore- that maybe she was growing into something greater.  She decided to tell Mary about the time she swam in the ocean at midnight.      It was a warm, summer evening on Whidbey Island.  Sarah had spent the evening roasting s’mores over a beach fire and singing songs with her family.  Every evening of that weeklong vacation, she had been on the beach.  She spent every moment walking along the shore, but at night liked to listen to the waves crash on the rocks, slowly churning beach glass and barnacles into sand.  The ocean called to her, like a mystery that needed to be unearthed.  Not in the way that the ocean calls to a sailor, but she was mesmerized by the intense drifting current and the white foam that disappeared after only moments on the rocky shore.  It inspired her.  How?  Why?  It was like a beat lost long ago, in another time, drifting across the ocean to meet her.  What?  How?  Why?  The song of the ocean was not a real song, yet the salt sea air made her drunk to the world.  It followed her through her every move, and it pleasantly haunted her dreams and thoughts.  The ocean sang to her, the waves the symphony and the air its conductor.  It seemed to connect her to a place or time almost unreal; her observations became acute and alive.  Things that she had not noticed suddenly became vivid and momentous.  They were unearthed and filled her mind and conscience.      She took a few steps towards the water, admiring the sparkling rocks and glistening water.  Although her father’s guitar was now safely inside the cabin, the song still swayed in her mind, a friend in the warm night.  Suddenly the guitar, waves, and air were all playing together in harmony; a melody so strong and inspiring yet so soft and beckoning that she could hardly contain herself.  She fell against the soft sand and stared at the stars, twinkling happily in the dark sky.  Why had she never noticed them before?  The song of the ocean controlled her; she closed her eyes and seemed to float closer and closer towards heaven and the stars.  Did the waves always make music?  Did the moon always make the water sparkle like diamonds?  Yes, but not for her.  Tonight was her night.  She felt limp and drunk with flying towards heaven and listening to earth’s song. 	    After awhile she stood up and looked across the Sound.  She was seeking some sort of confirmation of her vision, her dream, her revelation.  She received her answer.  The water nodded its agreement, the waves roared its truth, and the stars shone in affirmation. The waves rushed over her bare feet, a usually chilling sensation that now left her smiling with indescribable warmth.  She waded into the water.  About to dive in, she glanced back at the cabin where here parents and siblings were sleeping.  She turned around and dove into the cold water.  She was seventeen!  She was a dancing star and a singing wave, turning over and over in the ocean.  Was the sky so joyful for her?  Nothing answered.  She searched the heavens, floating across the waves in the water.  Looking, waiting, breathing short with impatience.  She stood and looked around her; the world was made in a new light.

       The school food actually sounds like a good idea. Or how about how it's not healthy to have to eat within 30 minutes? If you go out to lunch by the time you get there you only have 10 minutes to eat before you have to leave.  It took me forever to decide what topic I wanted to do. However, once I picked it seemed like good topics came up everywhere, it's crazy how that always seems to happen.  I finally chose to do the benefits of extracurricular activities. It's actually interesting how being involved in an after-school club or sport is related to higher test scores and better attendence. It'd be interesting to see what everyone else came up with for their junior project. Have a fun time with all the nice weather while it lasts!   - Rachel Penny

       So, this is my first time blogging for English class, whoohoo!  This is very exciting.  I don't quite know what to say, there really isn't a whole lot of controversial stuff to talk about here like there is in Clark's class.  What is everyone doing their Junior Project on?  I'm doing how disgusting and unhealthy school food is, because honestly...yuck!  The deep fried fries and extremely greasy pizza everyday, that needs to stop eventually.  Paul, I totally agree with you about how it's hard to keep your mind engaged on school when you do nothing in other classes...ah!  I don't know what to do with myself, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything.  What a great attitude, right? Haha.  Anyway, I'll see all you kids at school tomorrow!

       Rob I commend you on your idea.  Most students won't be able to vote on their own, I for one(missed the cut off by 2 weeks).  Paul, your recomendation on Ma$e's new song is superb, I heard it last Saturday and recognized the unique lyrics and smooth, calm vocals, so I had a feeling it was Ma$e.  Do you know if that was a single, or if it is part of a CD?

       Gosh, I remember JNCO's.  4th grade, had to get me a pair, couldn't afford it, I was a very sad little boy.  I remember them having innovative tee-shirts too.  Amazing how everything changes, since I don't think any of us would go near JNCO's now.  Are they even still around?  I think your skyview votes for the vote idea is very innovative, it's the kind of idealistic idea I'd expect to read about in Newsweek or something...  Oh the possibilities.  Is anybody else having trouble focusing their energy.  We have work in this class, clarks(somewhat), and my math class.  But everything else, especially my 3rd and 4th periods, are nothing.  It's really hard to keep a work minded mind not having to do any work.  I love summer, but I hate the mindless feeling I get from it.  I always like to have my energy focused on something.  I think I'm going to end up being one of those guys who can't bring themselves to retire, and when they have to they hate it and go back to work after 8 months.  Closing note, Ma$e- bling bling- is back.  Everyone needs to go listen to 'Welcome Back', who else can you see sampling the welcome back kotter song?  It's actually very good, and he hasn't given up on his preaching, which is cool.  But it's definately a break from the all the mindless club music I hear all the time now.

       i think that would be a good idea.  there is no way to have a student government that completely represents the school, but your idea is definitely an improvement.  seeing as this is my first year at skyview, sometimes it seems like asb doesn't really do anything aside from blatantly violating the dress code and getting away with it.  perhaps that's just me being cynical about the way things work.  haha.  go for it buddy, anything is worth a try.

       Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property).   But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then).   Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!!  I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints.   THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!!  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING!  And finally, people on the AP Fest party committee, please blog in and speakout about your plans and what activities are we going to have.......or is it a secret surprise party?

       Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot.  I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students— and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit.  There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option.  In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November.  It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school: a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own.  With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept.  What does everyone think?  I want comments from both students and their parents on this one.  But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone.  (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).  Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate?  Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this.  May democracy live long and prosper.  Love Rob  P.S.  Create Blogger profiles, they are kinda fun to do and give ME something to look at when I'm insomniacing

       Whatever happened to the greatest corduroy company of all time?  JNCO.  The name radiates a sense of "gangster."  In the grunge era of the mid 1990's, bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana influenced me, as a elementary schooler, to pursue such the novel brand of JNCO.  Now if you are pronouncing it JUH-N-COH, start pronouncing it JEEN-COH.  During this time of my life, others strayed to other brands such as Lee Pipes-a jean that went straight down and was usually ridiculously baggy.  Another blogger, Rob Muilenburg recalls JNCO's by stating "they changed my elementary life in a time when I hated Phil Sobolowski"  Yes, Rob, I agree with you, they did also change my life.  The JNCO scriblle will always live on as long as there is the memory.

       Hello!  I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on Sunday night and am enjoying a new climate, new colleagues and new sights.  Since Thomas asked about summer reading, I thought I would answer.  Mr. Wargo and Mrs. Grey-Hatton will be teaching the senior AP classes next year.  They have not assigned you any summer reading.  However, take advantage of your freedom and free time this summer and read on your own.  Your primary focus next year will be British literature and poetry.  Perhaps this summer you can indulge yourself in more modern fiction.  You might want to focus on prize-winning book lists like Pulitzer Prize winning novels or Booker Prize winners.  Or focus on modern writers from around the world.  Another option to consider is set yourself up with a book list of classics, because I guarantee you that you'll be in lit classes in college and wish you'd taken better advantage of your free time as people allude to books and authors you've heard of (maybe) but don't really know.  A few books I'd recommend?  Reading Lolita in Tehran The God of Small Things Persopolis Love in the Time of Cholera Anything by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Ibsen, Woolf, Hardy, Neruda Red Azalea Germinal  Have fun reading, be safe, and have a happy summer!

        I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses. And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.   I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.   Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!      Thomas Chen
