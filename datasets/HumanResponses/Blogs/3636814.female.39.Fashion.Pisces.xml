      (Found in the local Little Nickel)   3 CEMETERY lots, 1 single, 1 double, Hollyrood Cemetery, Shoreline/North Seattle.  Today's value $9,700 selling for $7,500 OBO or can separate.  Includes liner box, internment, and setting and care for bronze marker (marker not included.)     What?  Marker not included?      Can you imagine spending $9,700 (or even $7,500) to bury your dead corpse?  How freaking vain are we?  Ya know, I'm going to save enough to cremate my ass and spend the rest to have some fun during my last days on this earth.  I'd rather put it in a trust for my friends to throw a big party on me.  They don't even have to mourn me, 'cause I'll be back in their memories, and that's enough for me.  Today on the bus ride home, we came to a stop and I observed a woman panhandling at the traffic stop.  Did she look homeless?  Her sign said so.  Then I heard a young child in the back somewhere reading her sign.   Homeless 5 year old boy Food, MONEY, Toys Thank you and God Bless    It was one of those poetic moments.

      (Complete loser ex-lover misled me and let me come over to his house without telling me that he had a woman living with him (who is not just a roommate).  Mind you it's a 3 hour trip one-way.  Picks me up from the ferry, still not saying a word, chit chats, stops at K-Mart and we pick out flowers for his garden, still doesn't say a word about her, brings me to his house and she not realizing he hasn't told me, is greeting me and chit chatting away.  I ask him if I can speak to him privately (just to find out what the freaking hell is going on) but he won't.  Well, the girl ends up taking me back to the ferry while I find out the extent of his misleading the both of us.  At the same time I find out just how clueless she is and I know that she's perfect for him.  This is a transcript of him trying to, I guess, explain himself. Mind you this is only one instance of the crap he has pulled on me, and even though it may seem like I was an idiot to stay with him, I think I was just a patient woman who has finally had enough.)  His name has been hidden to protect his innocence.     *******:  Hi Deb, whats happening there?  LoveNDeath:  not much  LoveNDeath:  whats going on with you?  *******:  what time is it, I am in Michigan visiting family and friends  LoveNDeath:  it's 9:00.  i'm glad you're getting a chance to see your family   *******:  spening time with family tomorrow, church and then out to my dads to celibrate fathers day  LoveNDeath:  that's good   *******:  cool, it is 1154 here  *******:  it is nice to be near family  *******:  and friends, the weather here is perfect  LoveNDeath:  yes, the weather here has been really nice and hot   LoveNDeath:  been working a lot of hours   *******:  well that is good for the pocket book and keeps the mind busy  LoveNDeath:  yeh, been doing a little ebay to pay for college and am planning on taking a class this fall   *******:  what sort of class?

LoveNDeath:   Diaries Of An American Leftist Guerilla   LoveNDeath:  diary of sorts   *******:  ok, let me check it out  LoveNDeath:  sort of like when I wrote you every day on the ship   *******:  this is a slow connection, not like at home  *******:    So your a leftisit  LoveNDeath:     i'm a whatwhoit   LoveNDeath:  it's sort of a joke   *******:  Ok, that will work, I have not affilation with any particular group  *******:  as you know  LoveNDeath:  yes, you are completely you.     *******:  and I enjoy being just me,   LoveNDeath:  as well as I am.  not a part of anything but my own interests   *******:  well so am I, what do you know  *******:  I am sort of a luthern, so that is my religious affialtion that I do claim  LoveNDeath:  I am a debist.  a revolutionary    *******:  seems like it, to much rebelion  LoveNDeath:  these days it's good protection   *******:  it is, but when someone has the same feelings you sould open up some  LoveNDeath:  what kind of feelings?   *******:  Ideas and, well, I am not to good witrh feelings, they seem to complicate things  LoveNDeath:  obviously   *******:  ideas and points of view  *******:  very  obviously  *******:  but I do mean well  *******:  from the bottom of my heart I do  LoveNDeath:  no, I didn't think so the last time I saw you.  that was pretty crappy   *******:  it was well intended though  *******:  I ment you no harm  LoveNDeath:  please.   *******:  was trying to enrich the relationship was all, add to your list of friends to count on  LoveNDeath:  you should have told me you were living with her    LoveNDeath:  I really don't know what you were thinking and I don't care.   LoveNDeath:  you freed me   LoveNDeath:  thank you very much   *******:  oh, would that made a differenace?  I want us to all be friends and draw from eachothers carma  *******:  Karma  LoveNDeath:  you're karma's gonna bite you on the ass someday   *******:  whatever  LoveNDeath:  the difference it would have made is that I wouldn't have wasted my day   LoveNDeath:  what did you think would happen?   *******:  I seriously was hoping that we could be frineds and draw from eachother and laugh and have a good time being in eachothers company with a on the level relationship  *******:  that is what I had in mind, nothing else, you have a lot to offer with your talents  *******:  and writings, as well as your art  LoveNDeath:  that would have been nice, except you forgot to mention that you had a woman living with you that you are using for sex and a maid.   *******:  so?  I blew that,   *******:  using?  *******:  I do not think so  LoveNDeath:  if you would have been honest with me then I could have decided myself what I wanted    *******:  true, I should have, but I wanted you to be comfortable, thought you would have accepted it more than what you did, you took off in a Huff  LoveNDeath:  but you misled me and got me over there without saying so much as a word.  I can't trust you as a friend to tell  me things that are important to my well being   *******:  your well being is impportant to me, always has been  LoveNDeath:  put yourself in my place.  for one instant do that.   *******:  well, I am open minded and can accept the most of everything  LoveNDeath:  my friends are honest with me.  we don't keep things from each other   LoveNDeath:  I could accept being just your friend if you would just be honest with me.   LoveNDeath:  but as it is you have lied for these last two years and  have given me no reason anymore to trust you even as a friend   LoveNDeath:  I can accept that I will not be your partner.  it's ok with me. but I will not be lied to.   LoveNDeath:  you have damaged this relationship and that karma you will have to bear, because it will return in kind.   LoveNDeath:  I don't say this to be mean or nasty, but as a friend   *******:  I am sure it will, I have an old soul, it will survive as well as you  *******:  I wanted to enrich you with my friends, they are good people   *******:  from the heart only  *******:  I was busy on the phone talking with someone in Boston  LoveNDeath:  if you cannot see the fallacy in misleading me into thinking you and I were more than friends, even asking me to live with you (while she apparently was living with you), then not telling me she was living you and having me over...you don't recognize this complete disregard for MY feelings?     *******:  I still want us to all live together, I do know it will work  *******:  Maryann wants to be your friend as much as I do  LoveNDeath:  we will never be lovers again.  and if I accept you as a friend, it will be a long time before I ever see you again.  and when I do things will be fine.  but until then only time will repair the lack of trust I have   *******:  we are good people  LoveNDeath:  mary ann is  clueless.  very nice, but pretty clueless to your manipulations   *******:  the lack of trust is something that you have to deal with, I still trust you  LoveNDeath:  that's because I never gave you reason to distrust me.    LoveNDeath:  I am going to deal with it by excluding your physical presence from my life.    *******:  ok, wish you would change your mind   *******:  your hurt, I understand that  LoveNDeath:  if I find out that you ever treat MaryAnn like you've treated me, I will announce it to the whole fucking culdesac   *******:  I treat her well, as I want to treat you also!  LoveNDeath:  you want your cake and eat it too.   *******:  no, I want more than that Deb  *******:  I want the whole friggen bakery  LoveNDeath:  LOLOL   LoveNDeath:  fucking A   LoveNDeath:  take it all   LoveNDeath:  would you like a croissant with that?   *******:  I take as well as give my dear,   LoveNDeath:  no you dont   *******:  I do not like that sort of pastery  LoveNDeath:  don't even kid yourself on that   *******:  I am not going to argue with you, your a woman and I would lose  *******:  bye for now, it is late here, have to get up for church in the morning  LoveNDeath:  LOL   LoveNDeath:  night   *******:  night     Can You Spell Delusion?

      Riding the bus is interesting.  Besides offering opportunities to meet new people, there is the whole people watching aspect of it.  Watching as people walk past as I stand pigeon-like against the wall with other riders.  Men walk past, stop at the waste bin and rummage through it for food.  Women and their finery, or not.  Pudge everywhere; on girls, women, men, me.  Only the hungry are exempt and the one's who excercise or are naturally slim.     The clouds were fantastic tonight.  Periwinkle ones stretching out across the sky while pink cumulous like popcorn rise behind.  Twilight makes the snow pea flower even more beautiful, it's magenta shades luminous among the rising of the night.  I picked peas tonight, using my blouse to hold them and Grace's egg, walked through my garden checking all my flowers and vegetables.  The nats were out in force.  What's cool is when you find a patch (or they find you) hum different pitches and watch them react to the sound waves.     His name is Chris. He rides my bus sometimes.  I hadn't noticed that he'd sat in the seat across the aisle from me when we got on the bus.  The sun was in my eyes, and i was completely lost in my thoughts of the day, the scenery, what i might write tonight.  I dozed.  He coughed, and I looked over and he smiled.  I asked him if he had a nice day, and we exchanged emails...

                 Anal sex is fantastic.&nbsp; Enough said.&nbsp; Lube.&nbsp; Don't ya love that word...Luuube....      &nbsp;    Had a good eBay day.&nbsp; Lots of sales.&nbsp; Half my fall tuition for a five credit class, which is all I can concentrate on while working full time.&nbsp; Maybe I'll take two during winter quarter, because that's when I have less work.      &nbsp;    Stayed an hour late at work because my four o'clock punctured a tire and called her OnStar which sent a tow truck to change her flat from the Eastside to downtown Seattle.&nbsp; Mother of God.&nbsp; AAA would have been a lot quicker.&nbsp; She didn't get in until 6 PM.&nbsp; She was just down the street.&nbsp; In a pinch, I can change a tire.&nbsp; My own&nbsp;that is.&nbsp; Beats sitting in the warm sun for two hours waiting for some tow truck from 15 to 20 miles away to crawl through rush hour just to change a tire.&nbsp; I didn't mind waiting.&nbsp; Shit happens.&nbsp; Besides, not much going on in my life at the moment.      &nbsp;    She comes in with her friend who is a loon.&nbsp; The kind who acts like she knows what should be happening but ends up just stressing the bride and me at the same time.&nbsp; The bride, a size 26 chose a bias cut dress...she's very pretty, but bias cut dresses cling to everything.&nbsp; Girls, they belong on size 10 or less.&nbsp; I am not sure why she got a 26, because she needed a 28.&nbsp; Women are nuts about their size.&nbsp; Personally I'm a 28, and perfectly OK about it except when my pants start clinging to my ass.&nbsp; I've seen excruciatingly worse on 3rd Ave, so I don't worry too much about it.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    Personally I decided to lose weight.&nbsp; I'm on a 4 year plan to lose 100 pounds.&nbsp; I have to exercise.&nbsp; I want to go into Forestry and join the Peace Corps and it would be easier for me to hike and be out in the woods if I didn't have to pack all this around.&nbsp; After I lose 50, I'll start toning and working my muscles.&nbsp; LOL...my imagination runs rampant.&nbsp; I see myself wearing hip huggers and those really&nbsp;short Victoria's Secret things.&nbsp; It's a goal though which is always good.      &nbsp;    I made a huge batch of chicken chili.&nbsp; I'll be eating that for a while.&nbsp; Fiber...It's good for you.      &nbsp;    Luv ya Cameroon ;)

          Fitting that recently House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, questioning The Shrub's competence, declared "The Emperor has no clothes," as today's reading of  Men Of Mathmatics  by E.T. Bell, tells about a period of Napoleonic history that I think mirrors Bush better than even Hitler.   The differences between Bush and Napoleon are marked though.  Bush doesn't fight his own wars and military genius he is not.  This was 200 years ago in reference to Napoleon making Fourier (a mathmetician) as one of the "Legion of Culture" to civilize Egypt.  And so the story goes as written by Bell...     Napoleon in 1798 decided to take him along as one of the Legion of Culture to civilize Egypt--"to offer a succouring hand to unhappy peoples, to free them from the brutalizing yoke under which they have groaned for centuries, and finally to endow them without delay with all the benefits of European civilization."    Incredible as it may seem, the quotation is not from Signor Mussolini in 1935 justifying an invasion of Ethiopia, but from Arago in 1833 setting forth the lofty and humane aims of Napoleon's assault on Egypt.  It will be interesting to see how the unregenerate inhabitants of Egypt received "all the benefits of European civilization" which Messrs. Monge, Berthollet, and Fourier strove to ram down their throats, and what those three musketeers of European culture themselves got out of their unselfish missionary work...Following the victory of July 20, 1798, at the Battle of the Pyramids, the triumphant army whooped into Cairo.  Everything went off like fireworks, precisely as that great idealist Napoleon had dreamed, but for one trifling fizzle.  The obtuse Egyptians cared not a single curse for the cultural banquet which Messrs. Monge, Fourier, and Berthollet spread before them at the Egyptian Institute (founded, August 27,1798, in parody of the  Institut de France ), but sat like mummies through the great chemist's scientific legerdeman, the enthusiastic Monge's concerts, and the historical disquisitions of the scholarly Fourier on the glories of their own mummified civilization.  The sweating savants shed their sangfroid, damning their prospective enlightenees as tasteless cattle incapable of relishing the rich has of French erudition offered for their spiritual nourishment, but to no avail.  Once more the wily, "unsophisticated" native made a complete ass of his determined uplifters by holding his peace and waiting for the plague of locusts to be blown away in the scavenging winds.  ..    Later, when Napoleon crowned himself Emporer the young men of the Polytechnique (scientific college) revolted.  They were Monge's (mathmetician and close friend to Napoleon) pride.  "Well, Monge," Napoleon remarked one day, "your pupils are nearly all in revolt against me; they have decidedly declared themselves my enemies."  "Sire," Monge replied, " we have had trouble enough to make republicans out of them; give them time to become imperialists.  Moreover, permit me to say, you have turned rather abruptly!"     Needless to say, we can see why France might not be so gung ho to help us civilize the Middle East.  They've already tried and failed two hundred years ago.  Caution is one of those gifts that nations gain by learning from their past.

          My cat, Joy,&nbsp;had a kitten four weeks ago.&nbsp; It's very cool.&nbsp; Love is brownish black with blue eyes, and very much a Kat! OUCH! Love has discovered her claws and my ankles to her seem like a great scratching post.&nbsp; Ow Ow Ow.&nbsp; Brings that song by the Presidents of the United States to Mind...      &nbsp;    I came home and turned on the tube.&nbsp; A woman said to her husband all distressed and such, "I don't think I love you anymore."&nbsp; You know, one really has to question their concept of love if they think that.&nbsp; Shit, I still love my first husband, and my second, and every wuss ass that I've ever dated. &lt;grin&gt;&nbsp; oh, and every time I think I've experienced the worst of them, I find the next one to be even worse.&nbsp; Now, luckily I do love them unconditionally, but I'm not going to take any crap from them, no matter how pretty the wrapping or how long I've known them.&nbsp; I do see a pattern, no matter how extreme to the left or right they seem to be from each other, they have some things in common.&nbsp; They daze and confuse you with mixed messages, are non-committal, and think the world revolves around them.&nbsp; And it does, that's for sure.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    But I'm cured finally from any desire whatsoever of having one for my very own.&nbsp; Anyway, back to love between two people...It's a reflective thing.&nbsp; We see those characteristics in the other that fulfill our needs and desires.&nbsp; When we "fall out of love", it is because those needs and desires are not being met, and suddenly we see all the things that really bug us.&nbsp; It's pretty superficial and it took me about 35 years to figure that out, so&nbsp;I'm passing it along.&nbsp; Sometime I hope to meet someone who understands this.&nbsp; I'll know it when I feel it.&nbsp; Otherwise, I'm single with no dependents and completely freaking free to be me.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    Well the chicken's roasted.&nbsp; Got to go, gotta&nbsp;go.    &nbsp;

          Something to fill the time.&nbsp; Absolutely unboring.&nbsp; Tuesday is always like getting up and stepping through one of those veils of reality, literally and figuratively.&nbsp; I make wedding gowns (and veils).&nbsp; I love what I do, because I like making dresses.&nbsp; Building a multidimensional dream from flat pieces of fabric.&nbsp; The people they're for make my life interesting or hell.&nbsp; It's all a state of mind and when I go home I leave it behind, returning to the boring reality that is solely mine.&nbsp; It is relaxing though, like a siesta from the heat of noon, I find I need a rest from life just for a bit.&nbsp; A rest from husbands and lovers, from places to be and things to have.&nbsp; Just me and my animals, garden, eBay, painting, music and television.&nbsp; But I digress.&nbsp; I have to go with a thousand things to accomplish before 7:45 PM when I catch the bus back home.&nbsp; My preferred time/space travel.&nbsp; Bye for now&nbsp; :)

          At the moment that's all I really have besides time to plan, and rankle at this government's (Bush Administration {BA}) complete disregard for reason or respect of the American populace.&nbsp;       &nbsp;    For now, I have decided to direct my mind from men to matter.&nbsp; That which matters most is Love, and I shall spread it like manure on potatoes.&nbsp; Besides the asinine, speaking of The Shrub and other bottomless brain feed, you will find on occasion ribald and randy philosophy on man candy and thoughtless gardening tips among other drama in my life.&nbsp; Hopefully I will not be calling in my posts weekly from prison when the FBI finally catches up to me after mailing congress open letters and emailing Bush catcalls and pussy willows.&nbsp; He is the only person I allow myself to hate.      &nbsp;    So...I have decided to finish college in Forestry and join the Peace Corps for some excitement to fulfill that need in my heart to spread Love and Democratic Ideas while escaping the torture of the materialism that permeates American spirituality and spirit and disappearing into the rain forest with a pygmy warrior on my arm.&nbsp; Obviously this will not happen for a few years, and in the mean time I will be selling on eBay to support my dream of finishing college, saving and investing all my capitalistic earnings so that I might retire from my idealistic revolt in style.

      Well...ain't that interesting.  A penis fairy's been visiting my desk at work and left a little cock under the dress on my desk.  Hmmm...  Speaking of Dick, it is interesting how loving completely unattainable men frees the soul.  It will be a long time before I am interested in pursuing a relationship in the name of love.  To put myself in that place of sacrificial submission to any man deemed worthy of the care and feeding of another human heart besides his own.  But the thought of complete freedom now overrides any and all desires.  I go through the day imagining myself being in various parts of the globe, doing all kinds of exotic things, even boring mundane things become leisurely.   I went to see Marsha tonight.  She's a good woman who ends up putting everyone else at ease and I think that she's lucky to have her family and friends around her at this time.  To lose someone like John (her husband), who was a unique individual, and a character all in his own...he will be missed all around.

      Thank god it's Saturday.  My last work day of the week.  At least I've got the first appointment's alteration done so I don't have to go in early.  Slept in a little, listened to the morning news, played with the kat and kit in bed.  The kitten is now able to leap small buildings with a single bound.    Tonight after work I'll be going over to see Marsha.  That will be hard because I have to be strong for her and I know I'll cry a little.    I've been swimming in peas all week.  Picking them in the twilight every few days.  Raspberries are starting to ripen.  Poppies coming up all over.  Ahhh...The Transfer Of Power.  Well thankfully NATO is going to help us with that.  There is a war going on in America against Bush.  GO SEE FAHRENHEIT 9/11!!!  VOTE!!  Get that bastard out of office.

      It has begun, what I term Bridal Hell.  Summer weddings in full swing and my appointment book fully booked with alterations and custom.  10-12 hour days 5 days a week.     My garden goes unattended, unseen until weekends, except for a peek at twilight.  I love purple and white flowers because of that.

      I can only imagine losing someone that I loved, especially a husband, friend, companion and lover.  I would be completely lost, suspended in what would seem an eternal grief.  That first day to be surrounded by him, a shirt on the bed, shaving stuff in the bathroom, little things left behind by the living man yet to return from a errand.  Had I said I loved him, kissed him goodbye, hugged him?  Had we argued?  I can only imagine what my friend Marsha is going through.  I really liked him.  The celebration of his life will be on Saturday, and although I'm working I'm planning on stopping by afterward.  Another sorority sister, Carol's youngest is joining the army.  His reason was because someone has to fight for our freedom.  Some recruiter's propaganda.  Again I can only imagine what she might be feeling about her son joining the army at this time in this world situation.  I know she wasn't happy.  I enjoy seeing my 'sisters'.

      Last night I picked a large bowl of peas and lettuce stuff.  The red poppies were starting to bloom.  There are lots of other little garden flowers blooming too.  Cut back the grapes which reach out to take over the space around them.  This is the week of the Mock Orange blossoms, its fragrance drifting across the yard.  I stand under it and immerse in its smell breathing it in deeply.  It's only around once a year.

      Well today is starting off sad.  A close sorority sister's husband died yesterday of heart failure.  He was a pretty cool guy, and I know that she is devestated because they loved each other a lot and you could see it.  I'm not quite sure what to do.

      Well today's another day.  Beheading and bus rides, work and rest.  Enough about Bush, lets talk about me.    Last night I saw a good movie,  Bon Voyage , a French comedy/thriller.  Subtitled, even in French at times when they were speaking German.  Too funny.  Set in 1940-42 during the invasion, although it was really more about the invasion of the elite French trying to get out of the way of the invasion.  The suspense almost kills you towards the end, to the point of wanting to just do away with one character who is always interfering in the main character's life, to the point of jail, yet remains elusive where it counts most.  Sounds like a certain Dick I know.  Saw the previews for Fahrenheit 9/11.  Looked AWESOME!  Must see.  I'm planning a victory party the day Bush loses the election.  Him and his winged monkeys. Think if we threw water on him he'd melt and die, sort of Wicked Witch of Oz-like?

      Do you know that it has only been since 1920 that women have had the right to vote?  Only 85 years ago.  Blacks, even less then that.  One hundred years ago women were trapped in a social and finanicial quagmire, dependant upon marriage to support them.  Reputations were the only value given to them to build and outside that they had virtually nothing.    We take this life for granted.  How many women out there don't vote?  Shame on you.  It's only been 150 years since our civil war when the idea of slaves took Americans to the streets against themselves.  A cause so great that we killed each other over it.  Now we want to free the Iraqis from a great tyranny.  We have hardly freed ourselves.  It hasn't even been fifty years since blacks had the right to publicly eat, sit, or go to the bathroom with a white, much less vote.  Mobs were still lynching blacks publicly.  45 years ago.  We are a very young country, and we act like it.    What we have done in Iraq is a crime.  Our president lied to us trying to get us to believe Saddam had something to do with 9/11.  There is too much evidence out there that this administration was behind or at least took advantage of 9/11 to use that as a catalyst to invade Iraq.  He should be impeached for so many things.  Illegally detaining people for over 2 years in a prison in Cuba of all places.  Allowing torture of prisoners.  Oh, he knew about it or someone close to him did.  He argues hollowly feeding our fears and guilt to get away with what he is doing.  We (not I) throw a flag sticker on our car, wear our patriotism on our shirt sleeve, and stick by him because we don't know any better.  In the mean time he ruins our economy, international reputation, and our spirit.  He pulls God into matters and crosses the line between church and state upon waking.  He's delusional and it shows.    Well America gets what it deserves.  A karmic ass whooping.

      It was hot today.  I woke up with an all day headache and stayed in bed until 7 pm.  I listed some items tonight on eBay and am thinking of opening a store front to lower my monthly bill.  Things like fabric I can list one or two with the search feature and the rest in my store.    My baby kitty Love is developing well.  Now it's just a matter of teaching her to use the litter box.  Mama Joy is already in heat again, and I'm avowed to get her fixed soon.    The "War on Terror" SUCKS!  President Bush is fucked up.  I mean what was he thinking??????  Are you afraid of terrorists?  I'm not, and will not be ever.  If I die in a terrorists attack DO NOT MOURN ME AND START A WAR!  This country is so wrapped up in "compassion" and "victimization" that it has weakened itself and others by "pitying".  To pity another's plight weakens that individual.  It doesn't support them.  To be compassionate is to understand and to support in such a way as to help that other.  The Iraqis are not going to be better off now, because this war has brought the terrorists to their country.    This two party voting system sucks also.  But I will be voting for anyone but Bush and that means Kerry.  I like him ok, but I really liked Dean.  Personally I think we need to do away with "parties" and elect individuals on their merit, ideas, and personal convictions.  I want someone balls to tell the truth and be accountable to his actions.   Well enough of that completely emotional outburst.  I'm not myself.  The afterglow of a headache, and "Dick's" (The fictional name of my ex-lover) delusional jibberish yesterday.  He's so predictible it's not funny.  He doesn't deserve me.  I say that honestly without being self bloating.  He deserves exactly what he's got and that is someone who he can manipulate.  I feel sorry for her, but I don't pity her.  They both have their karma to deal with.  We all do.

      At the moment, when I come home from work, I first do a walk around the yard, check on the chicken, check out all my plant beings, and pick what ever is bearing (peas and raspberries currently).  Then go in and check eBay, cook dinner, sit and watch a little TV, then get online.  A pretty boring life.  Getting to the point where I wouldn't mind a little pot to entertain the senses.  I haven't had it for a few months, and opposed to whatever the government might say, it's not calling out to me in an addictive sort of way.  It actually helps me get A's in the college classes I take because it allows me to focus without distractions, especially when I'm reading literature, philosophy or whatever.  I love philosophy.  I took that class online and was stoned for the entire classwork, discussions and reading.  Blew my mind.  I've never enjoyed a subject so much and I still can't get enough of it.    My next endeavor is to excel in math.  I can't quite grasp it into second year high school Algebra, so I'm doing some reading on the philosophical foundations of mathematics.  I don't want to just memorize rules and equations, I want to know what it means, and how it works.  My goal is to teach myself and be able to test in the college level algebra.  It'll save me some tuition money and time.  Basically I am pretty much alone.  Not lonely, but alone.  I sort of like it that way, after being married twice and not succeeding at the relationships I've been involved in of late and over the course of my adult life.  They don't seem to see me or be interested in me for who I am.  It's always about them, sex, and them.  I'd rather be by myself, and I guess that "right" person will come along when I least expect it.  I'll know it though.  I'll know when I'm seen.

      I know the feeling of true freedom.  It is not a thing handed to you from one's government, but that which one feels as a person not dependent on another for love or sustenence of any kind.  When you draw from inside your soul and from the world as a whole.    Our citizens revel in their freedoms, watered down and given out like welfare to the needy by our government who behind the scenes is taking our important freedoms away bill by bill in the name of protecting us.  There will come a time, when we will be shackled by our own ignorance, if that time has not already come.

      I'm eyeing a couple bikes on eBay.  We'll see if I win one today.  I need a bumpersticker that says I Luv eBay.  A couple more yards of fabric sold today.    Marlan Brando died today.    It's overcast today and so I dug out my coat from the pile of other things covering my chair.  I need to clean tonight and tomorrow because friends are coming over for the Fourth.  We're planning on seeing a matinee of Fahrenheit 9/11.  Quite appropriate to see it on the Fourth of July.  Bush is not even funny.  Now he wants the directories to churches in order to campaign too.  Does Bush not get the idea of separation of church and state??  It totally flies in the face of it and should be illegal to use campaign funds to target church members specifically.    Someone needs to be shot.  Yes, I said it.  You can't even imagine the bills that are being passed this year to augment the Patriot Act. Besides, this whole Saddam trial is a puppet trial, and to hear him imply that he should be executed...Please.  Bush is as dangerous to the American public as Saddam was to his own people, because the freedoms that he is taking away will lead the way to our own government to terrorize us.  Am I paranoid?  Not really.  I'm just looking out for all the rest of us.

      You know, I don't understand why, especially someone who is big, would order a dress that is 2 inches small in the waist.  Luckily I am the best god damn seamstress in the West  (and possibly the world) , that I can find two freaking inches to let out.    If you are ordering a bridesmaid dress, big or small, order within the freaking measurements please.  It is far easier to take something in then miraculously find the inches needed to let out.  Better yet, go naked.  You'll be a good distraction for the bored and curious.

      I've been considering getting a bike. No, not a Harley, but a fuel efficient mountain bike.  I just think it would be nice to get some excercise and I have access to about 3 miles of road around a bay which is really pretty.  Then I started thinking about putting a bike rack on my car and going to other spots.  THEN I found myself fantasizing about going on day trips, even overnight trips...well, let's see if I even enjoy riding that much.  :)

      I'm going to bed tonight early.  Tomorrow I've got to get up early and do some eBay shipping.  7 items.  I think I'm liking this store.  Very tired though tonight.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are my late nights, and by the time I get home there's only a few hours to eat dinner and do a few things.   I talked to Dick today.  I started out nice, but then the conversation took a turn for the worse because while he says he's sorry about what he did, he doesn't understand the whole ethical proportions of it and why I won't be friends with him and his tart and accept the whole thing.  Yeh, the love of my life takes up with another woman and I'm just supposed to like it, not to mention be her friend.  No, it just ain't worth my time.    So I'm listening to an ad on the radio, a pharmaceutical company looking for teenage guinea pigs to try a new drug.  Get this for teen anxiety because of all the stuff going on in the world.  Our teenagers don't know what it is to have anxiety over the kind of crap that goes on in the world.  They're pansy-assed and soft, irresponsible and unreliable, brainwashed and programmed by television and video games, and haven't the moral character of an ant.  Thank you post 50's parents.    What fries me is that this government has a War On Drugs.  Well, that's just the illegal ones and their illegal because the government isn't making any money off of them.  The pharmaceutical companies use us consumers as guinea pigs, because only 10% of the drugs they issue are actually tested on humans.  Now they're marketing drugs to and for kids!  That's just as bad as the cigarette companies.  And we think it's ok, because it's legal, scientific, and  government and doctor approved.  Now, I've done my own testing and the propaganda about marijuana is false.

      Mmmm...Another week of Bridal Hell.  I stayed up toooo late last night, but it was hard to go to sleep because it was warm.  Almost forgot to wash my clothes, and that would have sucked because I wouldn't have a thing to wear to work this morning.  Luckily I remembered and popped them in while I was trying to get sleepy.  Then the kitten decided to play on the bed and well...  So I'm awake (barely) and supposed to be working, but was drawn like a 'squito to skin to the computer to check on my things selling and saw another book bought overnight, and a payment made.  Got some stuff to ship tomorrow.    I discovered I have a book that I'm selling written by Lynne Cheney.  Yes, Cheney's wife.  I have a strange assortment.    I can't tell you how utterly relaxing it is not to be in a romantic relationship.  The secret to life is to minimize needful relationships that one has, with people, things and self.  When I go home from work, there's no hurry, and if I wanted I could just lay about completely lazy...If I wanted.

      EBay.  I am possessed.  Selling, selling, finding things to buy to sell.  Today was a bonanza at the thrift shop, then I spent the rest of the day taking pictures, cropping, listing, relisting.  I have my storage room all neat and organized with all my listed items, and my shipping and sorting room a complete disaster.  My computer room somewhat organized with things that have had pictures taken and are ready to list.  My college fund is the proceeds from my endeavors.  Even now I want to list some more.  Tonight I picked more peas.  Shelled the whole lot.  Ate raspberries off the bush.

      I want someone like Clinton to run again.  Someone in touch with the people of this country.  People point fingers at him because of the sex scandel, but that is a product of human nature unlike the lies that Bush used to start a war.  He doesn't care about the economy, because he's not in tune with the struggles that are visited upon the ordinary American.  The middle class is non-existant.  We have teenagers who have jobs that support their materialistic needs, and adults who just make ends meet with no insurance or savings.    We keep raising the minimum wage when that is only a bandaid on a problem more complex than what we make per hour.  We lower interests rates which doesn't encourage traditional savings, but instead causes us to gamble with the stock market and spend more on our credit cards.  We ship jobs overseas, but we cut money to education making it more difficult for people to get the higher education needed for the jobs that are left.    What are we doing folks?  What are we doing?

      The books all say that love in the sense of one on one relationships is finding someone who fulfills our needs.  Really, it stems from one need; to find someone who we fulfill completely.  We don't want to know that that other person might have needs that we can't fulfill, because that makes us feel bad about ourselves.  So monogamy may be rooted in our own self desiring to be the only instead of the other.

      What happened last night, was not through any ill will of my own, because I have none.  And I hope you both stay together.  I was capable of seeing that you are good for him in those few minutes that I was at the house.  My concern is that Dick feels that he needs to lie about a lot of things in his life.  He's a very complicated man, even though he simply wants the simple things in life, and that is love.  I think that when he says he loves us, that it is true.  I think he wants what he has with you, but at the same time he wants what he had with me which was very part time.  Do you think he wants to give up other men?  Is his bi-sexuality something that you were willing to accept?  He lies because he needs the "whole fucking bakery".  Otherwise I haven't seen any inconsistancies in what he told me.     His anxiety stems from the emotional disfunction that he has had from an early age.  He acts out instead of just saying how he feels in an adult way. As strong physically as he is, he's not very strong.  Everything is a protection facade of who he really wants to be.  He wants to fit in.  These are the things I know about him, just from listening and watching him over the years.    Maybe what is best, is to let him have what he needs so that he doesn't have to lie anymore, because in the long run it's him we care about.  I think it's possible for the both of us as women to love him and accept him for who he is without causing him further spiritual distress.  The fact that you confronted me last night and talked to me , that and taking me to the ferry shows me how strong a person you are.  I don't want to come between you two at all.  I made future plans for my life that don't include him and I'm willing to live without him.  I just want him to finally be happy.

      Well.  The saga continues.  I half seriously, half jokingly posed an invitation to loverboy Dick for a Sunday overnight rendevous.  Partially because I wanted to see how "free" he was in this live in relationship, since the last time we spoke he said she was just a room mate.  Well it turns out she saw him talking to me online with him with the invite and got mad, he signed off and she hopped on her computer to talk to me. It turns out, that he brought her over to Michigan to meet his family and daughter.  Mmmm...Some room mate.  Who it seems is upset that there might be something between him and I.  Mmmm...She asked questions, and I answered them and posed a couple of my own.  You know, Dick wants his "whole fucking bakery" as he put it just last week.  I just want a piece of him.  She can have the rest of his psycho drama.    What is interesting is that I left him to marry Jim and he wanted to see me, and Jim wouldn't let me.  So I spent five years married to hell, when I really wanted Dick and then Dick turns around and gets heavily involved with this other woman to the point where she doesn't want him to see me...Damn Karma!  Well...I told her she was better for him than I was, but I also explained my feelings on the matter.  We'll see what happens next when the world turns.

      It occurred to me, to remember that only we are responsible for our own happiness(and that we cannot be responsible for someone else's).  For the first time in years I don't have a relationship in my life, and now the journey is to find myself and what makes me happy.    When we have someone else in our life, we are made happy giving to that relationship, but even in that, it is the other person that is making us happy or sad.  So even loving can become a burden in some form for the other, and doesn't address our own issues of being.  I think that's why they say that it's best to have a year between relationships, because it's a cleansing experience.  And you may find that the next relationship might be easier for it, even if it's with yourself.

       Patriotism and the struggle against US militarism  By David Walsh 13 June 2003   Film actor and director Sean Penn published a full-page statement in the May 30 New York Times opposing Bush administration policy and calling for a revival of democracy in America. His essay has undoubtedly struck a chord with a great many people.   http://www.seanpenn.com/kilroy.pdf    It touches upon concerns—so rarely articulated in the media—of broad layers of the population, such as the corporate domination of the Bush government, the assault on free speech, and the use of lies to justify a militaristic and predatory foreign policy, most clearly exposed by the absence of “weapons of mass destruction” in Iraq.  Penn, with more than 20 years in films, three Academy Award nominations and three directorial efforts to his credit, attempts in his somewhat idiosyncratic manner to link his deep feelings for his children and his late father to wider issues, including the future of American society and the meaning of patriotism.  As Penn notes, his October 2002 public letter to George W. Bush in the Washington Post taking issue with his Iraq policy was followed “by a tidal wave of media misrepresentation, and even accusations of treason.” All the more admirable his decision to visit Baghdad in December and report on a country that “was the most decimated, starved, diseased and polluted place I had ever witnessed.”  Writing of the post-war situation, Penn observes: “If military intervention in Iraq has been a grave misjudgment, it has been one resulting in thousands upon thousands of deaths, and done so without any credible evidence of imminent threat to the United States. Our flag has been waving, it seems, in servicing a regime change significantly benefiting US corporations.”  In the most powerful passage of the Times statement, Penn names names and corporations, “We see Bechtel. We see Halliburton. We see Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Powell, Rice, Perle, Ashcroft, Murdoch, many more. We see no WMDs. We see dead young Americans. We see no WMDs. We see dead Iraqi civilians. We see no WMDs. We see chaos in the Baghdad streets. But no WMDs.”  Penn has elsewhere warned about the return of “the dark era of Hollywood blacklisting.” The most recent media and industry attacks on the actor come on the heels of the corporate boycott of the Dixie Chicks, the exclusion of Tim Robbins from a Baseball Hall of Fame ceremony, the attempt to prevent anti-war performers from making comments at the Academy Awards, the efforts by NBC executives to silence Martin Sheen and the general attempt by the media to whip up hostility toward any public figure who dares question the motives or policies of the Bush administration.  Having said that, the Times statement expresses confused or mistaken ideas that will not contribute to bringing about what Penn wishes to see—the establishment of a just and genuinely democratic society.  One of the central issues Penn touches on is American patriotism. He returns to this theme several times, musing that the US flag reflects “sacrifice and heroism” and adding, “I am an American and I fear that I, and our people are on the verge of losing our flag.” The thought of the flag reminds him of the funeral of his father—blacklisted director Leo Penn, a veteran of World War II—in 1998, during which a military honor guard presented his mother with a folded American flag.  He writes: “Yet, now here we are, just those five short years have passed, and that same flag that took me so long to love, respect, and protect, threatens to become a haunting banner of murder, greed, and treason against our principles, honored history, Constitution, and our own mothers and fathers. To become a vulgar billboard, advertising our disloyalty to ourselves and our allies.”  The question of patriotism is a complex one, which only underlines an essential fact: there is no way to approach seriously the critical political issues raised in Penn’s Times statement without a thoroughgoing study of history. No artist or politician can survive without intuition, but intuition alone is an unreliable guide in art or politics.  Patriotism means different things to different people in America. In the final analysis, this is a reflection of the fact that there are really two, mutually irreconcilable, “Americas”—that of the working people and that of the ruling elite.  To the mass of the working population, the only social force that retains a serious commitment to democratic principles, patriotism and the flag are associated, if only semi-consciously, with the traditions of the American Revolution, Lincoln and the sacrifices of the Civil War, the great labor struggles of the 1930s, and the gains of the mass struggle for democratic rights in the 1950s and 1960s. For working people in general, “love of country” is believed to be bound up with a striving for equality, a sympathy for the underdog and a democratic spirit.  The political and media establishment, whose members either openly reject democratic traditions or merely pay lip service to them, seeks to exploit these widely-held sentiments. The present-day ruling elite in the US would have the population believe that it embodies the democratic ideals of the past, when it actually represents the repudiation of these traditions. The official appeal to patriotism is aimed at lining the American people up behind its worst enemies in the ruling circles, in the name of the “national interest” and “national security.”  A deep-felt empathy for what is best in American life and history cannot obscure certain elementary facts. Penn’s suggestion that the US is “threatened” with being overtaken by reactionary elements, that we are “on the verge of losing our flag,” is a misstatement of the historical case. The United States became an imperialist power more than one hundred years ago, certainly by the time of the Spanish-American War in 1898, when it grabbed the Philippines, Guam and Puerto Rico and established de facto control over Cuba.  The US was a leading and ultimately the dominant imperialist power of the twentieth century. America’s entrance into World War I marked a new stage in its emergence as a great and predatory power. Nor did it intervene in the Second World War for humanitarian reasons, although a hatred of fascism animated the generation that volunteered to fight against Hitler and Mussolini. Indeed, a considerable portion of the US ruling class, like Henry Ford and George W. Bush’s grandfather, Prescott Bush, either politically supported fascist rule or entered into profitable commercial relationships with fascist regimes.  American imperialism’s crimes against peoples around the world, including its own population, are innumerable, from the bloody suppression of the Filipino people in 1899-1901 to the three million deaths and vast destruction it caused in Southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis as a result of two wars and murderous sanctions from 1991 to 2003. The US has helped install and has supported brutal military dictatorships throughout Central America and Latin America, and remains the chief sponsor of the suppression of the Palestinian people by Israel.  The “Stars and Stripes” does not signify today what it stood for in 1776 or 1861. Tens of millions around the globe see it, with justification, as an emblem of their oppression and misery.  US foreign policy is inseparably bound up with domestic policy, and both express the class interests of a financial oligarchy, whose monopoly of wealth and power is rooted in the existing economic system—capitalism.  In 1951 James P. Cannon, the leader of US Trotskyism at the time, addressed the question of the relationship of America’s past to its present. Explaining his attitude to American Independence Day, he wrote: “The representatives in Congress assembled 175 years ago were the great initiators. When they said: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident,’ they started something that opened up a new era of promise for all mankind. That’s what I am ready to celebrate any time the bands begin to play—the start and the promise. But nobody can sell me the Fourth of July speeches which represent the start as the finish and the promise as the fulfillment. I quit believing in them a long time ago. As soon as I grew old enough to look around and see what was going on in the country—all the inequality and injustice still remaining—the beneficiaries of privilege, claiming the heritage of our first revolution, struck me as imposters.”  The present administration concentrates within itself the most brutal and despicable elements of the ruling stratum, but the Bush crowd has not appeared out of nowhere. It has been called “from the deep,” so to speak, by the historic crisis of American capitalism.  The US ruling elite seeks to overcome the loss of international economic hegemony by deploying its military superiority to “organize the globe” under its dominion. The conquest of Iraq is only the beginning. Whatever the tactical disagreements, every wing of the political establishment, liberal to ultra-right, Democrat and Republican, is essentially agreed upon the necessity and legitimacy of this desperate project.  Diffuse “patriotic” sentiments will prove to be an unreliable basis for opposing this. Such sentiments are regularly played on by the establishment to paralyze public resistance to all manner of filthy things. After all, a significant percentage of those in the US who supported the recent invasion believed, or wished to believe, that America was “democratizing” and “liberating” Iraq.  Patriotism, in so far as it involves an identification with the national state, inevitably leads down the well-beaten path to the Democratic Party, or “third party” pressure groups on the Democrats. Penn writes that he is not “a Democrat, not a Republican, not a Green, not aligned with any party.” After excepting Senators Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts and Robert Byrd of West Virginia and Representatives Barbara Lee of California and Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, he accuses the “Democratic leadership” as a whole of being “entirely complicit” in the Bush war drive, adding that this “has been an obscene and cowardly betrayal of their constituencies.”  However, Penn’s “exceptions” prove the rule. The differences between these Democratic Party politicians and Bush officials were and remain purely tactical. They disagree on the best means of upholding the interests of American capitalism.  Kennedy, Byrd, Lee and Kucinich, like an entire layer of liberal pundits and establishment figures, reasoned that the administration’s policy of ignoring the UN and picking a fight with European allies cut across long-term American economic and security interests. All of them have supported the Bush administration’s so-called “war on terrorism”—the basic political and propaganda framework for military aggression abroad and political repression at home. None of them has exposed US policy toward Iraq—not just in the recent war, but for more than a decade—for what it is: a recrudescence of the most naked forms of imperialism.  The comments of Byrd, who made a number of stinging attacks on the Bush administration and its policies in Iraq, reveal the underlying consensus that, in the final analysis, unites Bush and his liberal critics: “Calling heads of state pygmies, labeling whole countries as evil, denigrating powerful European allies as irrelevant—these types of crude insensitivities can do our great nation no good. We may have massive military might, but we cannot fight a global war on terrorism alone. We need the cooperation and friendship of our time-honored allies as well as the newer found friends whom we can attract with our wealth.”  What is the Democratic Party’s real “constituency”? It is a big business party, financed by and beholden to huge corporate and financial interests. It has not “betrayed” these interests, it has resolutely served them. If, in a more prosperous period, the Democrats were able to mediate class conflicts and, by introducing certain measures of social reform, pass themselves off as the party of the “little man,” those days are long gone.  The Democrats’ hands are dripping with Iraqi blood. Penn himself acknowledges the role played by the Clinton administration in Iraq—imposing sanctions and carrying out continuous bombings.  The danger exists that in citing his “patriotism,” Penn is accommodating himself, perhaps unwittingly, to the contemporary media-political atmosphere in the US, dominated by right-wing and neo-fascist elements. There is no appeasing such people, nor any need to. The critical question is the clarification of the working population on basic historical and political issues.  We Marxists take as one of our starting-points the rejection of nationalism in favor of a higher principle, internationalism, the solidarity of the peoples of the world. This does not reflect any contempt for the revolutionary-democratic traditions in the US or any other nation, but is the only basis for defending them and preserving their universal core. The great divide in the world is not between nations and peoples, but between social classes. Economic inequality is the most pressing social problem in America today.  Penn’s statement in the Times has the character of a heartfelt, but isolated flare sent up into a dark sky. There is a social force, however, capable of resisting and defeating American capitalism’s brutal policies and ambitions—the American and international working class.  The central problem facing workers in the US is the need to break from the political dominance of the ruling elite, maintained above all through the Democratic Party. The greatest betrayal of the trade unions has been their role in tying working people to the liberal rump of the political establishment. The political self-determination and independence of the working class, established through the building of a mass socialist party, is a prerequisite for a successful struggle against militarism, social reaction and attacks on democratic rights.  These are issues that Penn and others seriously opposed to the reactionary policies of the Bush administration need to consider.  urlLink   urlLink

      I got an email from my brother in regards to my movie review of Fahrenheit 9/11.  Here is his response:   "I used to watch Michael Moore on Politically incorrect with Bill Maure (spelling?)...He was a regular on the show and it was because he is such a loose cannon and would talk shit about anything at ANYONE was the only reason he was a returning guest...Got to keep up the ratings!  Most of his propaganda was stuff like "stop driving your SUV" and lock up "ANWR", bla,bla,bla to name a few of his bright ideas.  He is a friggen A-Hole that is scamming people for their money by taking these off the wall political stances, riding the backs of environmentalists and anti-gun groups and then getting paid to be a guest or make movies like "Bowling for Columbine".  Like I said I watched him quite a bit because I had been watching "Politically Incorrect" for most of the years it was around.  I liked the show because it had lots of guests with differing personalities but was a serious and comedic setting at the same time.  Totally opposite of what you would see on PBS political reviews (very dry).  Its now on cable and I don't pay for that liberal propaganda ( ha ha just a joke)  I cant afford it.  I also watched "Politically Incorrect" go off the air after 911 and I'm talking about the second time.  The first time the network pulled it because Bill said some stupid thing that pissed off the sponsors.   You think M. Moore makes as much as you in a year?  You think he lives in some modest home?  You think he practices what he preaches about fossil fuel?  Do you think he gives a shit about anything but his now over 15 min of fame?  You're kidding yourself if you think he does.   He is making a name for himself by becoming the Anti political figure.  Which is like saying reverse psychology...There is none.  He is becoming a political figure by trying to be the Anti.  So just like most/ all political figures its all about MONEY, POWER, INFLUENCE, FAME.  He is what he thinks he is against!"   Here is mine, although apparently his spam blocker is rejecting it at the moment.  Hopefully that will be corrected soon :)   "THANK YOU :)  for your opinion!  I want to hear what you're about and what you think on things, because it is important to me to know who you are beyond the guy who has a great wife and 2 beautiful kids and a fulfilling job.    I have never watched Moore on that show, and what drew my attention was some of his writing and then his film Bowling for Columbine which was excellently done and expresses my own opinions.  Whatever he thinks or has thought in the past is not even comparable to the heinous crime that Bush and his administration are committing.   Whatever you think about Moore, this is not an attack on the Republicans or even (I think) a liberalized attack on the government.  It points out some facts which are true about this president, as a person (puppet) and his unethical administration, and although the opinions are his, it is laid out more for the watcher to form his own opinion.  While I applaud Moore for having the guts to make this film, I wasn't thinking about him, but about the larger picture that he was presenting while watching the movie.  I hope that you and Michelle do see this and are not distracted by what you think about Moore but watch it for the facts that are presented.  It cannot be any worse than relying on news in whatever form that is white washed for our consumption and owned by people who do not have you in your best interest.  If you don't want to put dollars in his pocket, then buy a ticket to another movie and go see this movie instead.   Most of all, I am the one referring you to this film, and I'm not a dolt, crazy or "liberal" whatever that is.  I draw my conclusions based on what I think and not what someone else does.  Have you ever known me to fly someone else's flag but my own?  I'm as independently minded as they come, believe me."

      I am fighting boredom.  In my new found freedom of having no love relationship with another, I have finally discovered boredom.  Perhaps that is why I am looking forward to biking, to get away from the house without the expenditure of gas or aging my car further.  To do something, go somewhere.    Life loses a little magic when there's no one to love.  Even the flowers seem dull and only interesting.  It's easier though, not having a relationship.  Boring, but easier.  I'll feel better when classes start in the fall.  I need to pick a class out.  Maybe a science class.

      I have drank my last can of soda.  I believe sugar is poisoning my system and after a week of drinking water, then having a few sodas on the weekend of the fourth, headache city.  I am also only buying drinks that come in a glass container, as plastic not only off gasses into what it is containing, but at high and low temperatures it leaks dioxins into the food or drink.  so putting it in the cooler or microwaving isn't good.  Dioxins are suspected to cause mysterious diseases like Lupis and MS.  They also contribute to causing cancer.

      There are three things a business must have in order to be a success.    Focus, Consistency and Direction.   If any one of these three things are lacking, the business will be nothing more than mediocre if not failing.  These qualities must come from the top, and management must be willing and able to teach these qualities to all it's employees.    Training of employees must be a priority for a smooth running business with your goals and methods theirs.  Work ethics that are lacking must be addressed consistently to set an example to other employees and to garner their respect.

      The Fourth is always interesting around my house because I live on leased land on an indian reservation.  Fireworks are legal out here, and it's always a spectacular sight around the little bay down from my house.  Fireworks 360 degrees.  One just stands there looking all around non stop from dusk past midnight.  It's a glorious sight, sulfur drifting through the air, people in the streets, it looks and sounds like a war zone minus the screams of the maimed and dying.  Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light...

      Every citizen of the United States should see this movie. Especially, no matter how disturbing, 17 yrs+. The fact is that if it there were no truth to it, Bush would be suing Moore's ass over slander. But he's not. Neither is Cheney. This movie only confirmed what I, myself, have been discovering over the course of the last couple years. At the end of the movie I clapped, and the whole theatre started clapping.    This movie made me angry, and it was a call to arms for every one of us who believe in keeping America free. Free from the corruption of power and greed. This movie was Michael Moore's declaration of war against Bush and his corrupt administration.  This war is for the hearts and minds of the American people on the same turf that Bush has been treading with his propaganda of fear and terror.  It is a war of words, not swords, no bloodshed, just exposing the truth of a scam worked on our trust in those we elect to govern us.

        Men are dogs.    Dick,   I don't know what you want from me.  When you say friend, it doesn't really mean that.  I am willing to be your friend ONLY.  This, at the moment, means communicating online.  If we cannot establish a friendship online excluding sexual expectations and sexual comments, then there is nothing for us to talk about.  You are living with another woman and have treated me terribly.  You were not a friend to me at any time whatsoever, and because you lied and kept me in the dark about things, I do not trust you at all.  In that, there is no future for us romantically, sexually or friendly, because friends don't lie and manipulate others for their own agenda.     At the moment, I don't like you very much at all as a person, because you have shown me the character of a huge asshole son of a bitch.  If you want my friendship, you will have to correct that image of yourself to me, because at the moment, I could care less if I am your friend.  And if that happens, then I will reconsider calling you by anything other than Dick, which is what men called Richard are called when they act like one.   Deb

      In response to Mossback "What If Bush Wins?" in this week's Seattle Weekly.  Well Mr. Berger,   If Bush wins, I wouldn't doubt he'll get bumped off by someone inside his circle and Cheney will be president.  Just a thought.  I mean Bush is obviously a fuck up who's only value was because of his tie to Daddy.  He himself has been a great distraction for who is really pulling the puppet strings.  It's pretty obvious that Cheney is the brains, be that as they are.  You can always spot the manipulator like a ventriloquist who sometimes can't keep his mouth still.     But seriously...I feel the need to purchase a firearm and bury it in my garden.  The next thing they'll be taking away is our right to bear arms in the name of "terrorism", telling us by outlawing weapons, it will make it harder for the terrorist to attack us or something like that.  Someday it'll come to a revolution or a civil war, probably the latter.     This government is not ours.  It is a facade of criminals who only see power as the aims of a higher purpose, and we are no better than the cattle bred to feed us.  It is not right what their doing, if there is a right vs wrong.  If the forefathers of this nation could see the path this country has taken, it would be inconceivable to them how misunderstood their intentions had become.   And how did this get this far?  Who caused this to happen?  The people themselves, as a collective unenlightened mass of senseless individuals who's only concern was their selves who has become so engrossed in the quest for material happiness that they pacify themselves with weakened values and lack of responsibility.   In defense of the Homeland, I would go as far as active rebellion against tyranny of this government as peacefully as possible, but would be prepared to take it by force if needed.

      My response to Cameroon's gender issues:  Ahh...Actually I am having sex with  you .  I do not think of you as a woman, Cameroon.  Nor do I really think of you as a man, except for the enjoyment I have with your male member.    I would like to know in what way you feel like a woman.  What do you think it is like to be a woman in the context that you are feeling?    Apart from the skin we are in, female or male, I see people as a universal soul struggling to define themselves in a world that is made up of boundaries and labels.  If this were a different world, with different parameters of existence (utopia for example) we would all be just individuals with a common goal of love and understanding. (that's my utopia, Bush's is something else entirely).  So, what kept you from exploring your ass long ago?  It's a very pleasurable orifice.  It also represents a certain submissiveness, a letting go of restrictive boundaries, and a general opening up to your inner self.  Aside from that is is also a great place to experiment with the limits of the human body.

(I actually thought, "are the hardware stores still open 24 hours?") not around here.  That's ok though, cause just getting the basic bike together was enough for tonight.  My mind was not ready for such things as gear adjustment and brakes.  Besides! I forgot to get an air pump.    this thing is big.

Monday I picked up the college catalog, made an appointment with an advisor for next Monday to look at a plan for my transfer degree (now that I have a major picked [forestry]), and have preliminarily picked a couple classes out that might work for Fall quarter.  At the moment those are two online biology classes, one for the Pacific Northwest or one on Birds.  Possibly one for geology.

      I love John.  You know the kind of love that doesn't demand anything.  Two free spirits with vague memories of a past concept of idealic love.  Little rituals and absolute attention in an intense blessed evening.  And no sex.  Sex with John is fun.  But I'm happy just sharing thoughts with him which is erotic in itself.  I love that we completely connect by sharing the same view.  That's the most erotic aphrodisiac is to share the expanse and colors of a sunset.  He understands me.

      Well Dick didn't come by, which I think is good in a way for me anyway.  I just want him to be happy.  I used to be madly in love with him, the kind where you accept his insecurities and issues, but the lying just over time disappointed me.  I still love him, but not in the mad sort of way.    I am now "in love" with the thought of my soon to arrive bicycle.  A bike represents huge possiblities for a relatively small investment.  I mean, with a bike one can just use it for a little jaunt down the road a couple times a week, or everyday, bike to work, or go on treks to other states, or clear across country.  Tour de France or Bust!  Man, now that looked like an awesome thing to do.  Not that I'm in any kind of shape to even just get down the road.  But it's the possibilities.  Today I'm going to spend the day with John.  I'm looking forward to that.

      WASHINGTON (July 11) - U.S. counterterrorism officials are looking at an emergency proposal on the legal steps needed to postpone the November presidential election in case of an attack by al-Qaida, Newsweek reported Sunday.  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge warned last week that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network may attack within the United States to try to disrupt the election.  The magazine cited unnamed sources who told it that the Department of Homeland Security asked the Justice Department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the election if an attack occurred on the day before or the day of the election.		 			 The department was asked to review a letter to Ridge from DeForest Soaries, who is the chairman of the new U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the magazine said.  The commission was created in 2002 to provide funds to the states to the replace punch card voting systems and provide other assistance in conducting federal elections.  In his letter, Soaries pointed out that while New York's Board of Elections suspended primary elections in New York on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, "the federal government has no agency that has the statutory authority to cancel and reschedule a federal election."  Soaries wants Ridge to ask Congress to pass legislation giving the government such power, Newsweek reported in its latest issue that hits the newsstands Monday.  Homeland Security Department spokesman Brian Rochrkasse told the magazine the agency is reviewing the matter "to determine what steps need to be taken to secure the election."  Republican Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN that the idea of legislation allowing the election to be postponed was similar to what had already been looked at in terms of how to respond to an attack on Congress.  "These are doomsday scenarios. Nobody expects that they're going to happen," he said. "But we're preparing for all these contingencies now."

      Well, last night I partied with my friend Cameroon after picking up some primo pot.  Got completely roasted THEN went and picked out a couple DVD's to watch.  Animatrix was what we watched and it was sooo excellent.  I love comic art and this was wonderful.  Plus the story couldn't be beat.  Cam's been a friend for about 20 years.  Only recently have we been sleeping together.   I like analyzing everything with him.  Great person to watch good movies with.  I think Dick is coming over today.  Jane and I have compared notes and she discovered that it was my watch under the Dicks bed that she found, so I will soon have my watch back.  We agreed that the undercurrent issue that we have was his lying, so I think we have agreed to think more about him and his spiritual and emotional growth and put aside our own desires (for the moment) and give him the space so that he doesn't feel like he has to lie.  He might lose her, if she feels threatened, but she seems level headed.  Personally I have discovered that I am not and don't want to be responsible for someone else's happiness, so I hope they don't split up.  I see too much of him, his issues, and so it really is unfair for me to be with him I think.  Even if I didn't want to, I'd end up manipulating him even if it was for his own good.  I don't know what will happen.  I just hope it works out for the best, and at the moment that's to eliminate the need for him to lie, because it hurts him more than it hurts us.  Tomorrow I'm seeing Fahrenheit 9/11 with my friend John. He's like a flower.  A big sun flower. He just got a job and is feeling a lot better now.  Financial strains can drive you bonkers.

      I had a pretty good day until I got off the bus coming home and found a note on my car.&nbsp; It's a residential street (barely), and they thought that I should park in the Park and Ride instead of in front of their house.&nbsp; Well fuck them for being petty people.&nbsp;   I can't seem to find the peace and bliss that I know is inside of me (somewhere).&nbsp; I mean I should just let this roll off because they obviously like to park their trucks out front, and people like me are a nuisance to their perceived space.&nbsp; Except their property does not legally&nbsp;include the road in front of their house.&nbsp; So while I can sit here and figure out how to not take it personally, it still sort of pisses me off because I wasn't breaking any rules parking there.&nbsp; I could press the point and keep parking there, but then   that   is the magnification of negativity which keeps anger and hate existing in the world.&nbsp; I usually don't even park there anyway.&nbsp; They must have the time to pay attention to the few times I've parked their in the last month.&nbsp; I don't want to think about it anymore.   I'm tired.&nbsp; It's one of those late work nights, so I only have a few hours 'til bedtime.&nbsp; All I felt like doing when I got home is relaxing my nerves from the note, so I pulled out the weed.&nbsp; Ahhh...&nbsp; I shouldn't probably be using drugs to dull the pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm not perfect, but I don't let them control me.&nbsp; Everyone has a vice and this is mine.&nbsp; It represents a freedom to me, because there is no one telling me I can't.&nbsp; Besides it's entertaining.   I want my bliss back.&nbsp; I want to tap into the universal love source, that I know is everywhere, lift up those veils of perceptions that seem to be shrouding my waking days.&nbsp; I must be thinking too much about me.&nbsp; I think that's what it is.&nbsp; Sort of like a protective shield between boredom and dreaming of escape.&nbsp;   I have found myself not relishing another attempt at intimate relationships.&nbsp; I could care less about ever having sex again.&nbsp; I just want to be able to find that place of tranquility without having to be driven crazy to experience it.&nbsp; I miss though, loving someone.  I had a case of deja vu today.&nbsp; Very strong, like a vivid dream, I experienced it aware that in it that moment, in another time,&nbsp;one of it's elements&nbsp;was the realization of deja vu that was the current deja vu.&nbsp; I tend to take these signs that a shift in perception is about to occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also could mean something is going to happen.

      Ugh, what a hot muggy day in the Pacific Northwest.    Today was my day off so I went down to Seattle to talk to my college advisor to figure out the best route to go as far as a transfer degree for the UW.  I found out I've only 6 classes left to get an Associate of Arts.  So depending on how much I can sell on eBay, I'll be taking one or two classes, Math 98 and/or Biology 101.  Cool!  After that I hit Value Village since Monday's is 99 cents for certain tag colors regardless of the original price.  I found a Bissell Spot Cleaner, humidifier, and a ton more for 99 cents apiece, and they all work and are in near perfect condition.  Listed some more fabric too.  And some 100 year old newspapers that I have.  I've got to raise $690 before mid September if I want to take both classes.

      It's interesting, all the nuances of an economy.  I've been watching it for a while, considering that I've been not quite struggling to maintain a living and a life due to the rapidly increasing price of goods vs my wage growth.  We've got a problem on our hands, that lowering taxes isn't going to address.    On another note, my neighbor must be out of jail, because there's an increase in drug traffic past my house.  I've decided to write down licenses and take digital pictures, along with time/date stamp.  I am trying to prevent a repeat of last year when my house got robbed.

      Sunday morning.  This one consists of spending the last three hours online reading personals and editing mine.  I'm really not looking for anyone, I just am open to opportunities.    It's a nice morning and the cats are bounding around the house. A few things sold in my eBay store.  I need to make some money since August 12 is the date to pay tuition.  Tomorrow I'm going down to see the advisor at the college to see where I'm at and where I need to concentrate my efforts.  I rode my bike a small ways yesterday.  Somehow I hadn't thought it would be so difficult to ride, but it was easier to get back up the hill and I'm figuring out the gears.  My ass hurts though.  I can't wait for the new seat I ordered.  I read that women have a wider sit bone, regardless of weight, and I can now understand that.  I'm not discouraged though.  I keep imagining myself using it daily.  Today I'm going to spend some time listing more eBay stuff.

      I have too many interests and not enough time to explore them.  Like tonight, I was debating riding the bike or going on a whimsical tour around the garden.  Well the latter won out with the first long glance of the imperfect world of a cosmos.  In it, the poetic wonder of nature's magic of natural grace.   I love the digital camera for it's sponteneity and instant gratification.  Orgasmic.  Who needs men?  Well, their nice to look at.  And can be warm and cuddly.  They can also be a complete pain in the ass, in my experience.  Now flowers...they make a perfect soulmate.  I love my sunflowers.

      We are living in a world where we are constantly shown, by the media, man's inhumanity toward each other through violence, terrorism, and war. Never has there been a time that our light is more needed than now. During this powerful time in history we, as a group of conscious beings, actually can shift the awareness of the planet. The soul work we are doing has prepared us perfectly for this precise moment. Our voices, actions and intentions will inspire and heal so many. No longer can we sit by and just visualize our government making conscious choices. We must combine our spiritual practices with uplifting words and positive action.  If we can do this, I believe with my whole being that we are on the brink of something truly amazing. The vision I hold is that we are a moment away from creating a world safe for our children, their children, and all generations to follow.  Some of you might be saying, How can I as one person change what is happening in our government and our world? By becoming a spiritual activist, and by being that spark to help others raise their awareness and find peace. By committing to creating peace within yourself and your family, by voting and encouraging others to vote for political leaders who value humanity, and by helping others discover their light, you set in motion the intention of positive transformation.  If one by one each of us takes personal responsibility for raising the awareness of humanity we begin to shift the global consciousness.  There is a powerful phenomenon in group behavior called reaching a critical mass. What this means is that one person begins initiating a behavior, others observe it and begin imitating the action. Then one by one others join in until enough people are behaving in the same way and the entire crowd follows: this is the critical mass.  I personally witnessed this phenomenon over the weekend when my husband and I took our children to a Marlin's game. The stadium was filled with the energy of 25,000 people, each an individual brought together for the collective purpose of enjoying an afternoon of baseball. My six-year-old daughter Riley, who is very wise and observant, was fascinated by the crowd. As she looked around with determined eyes she leaned over and said, “Mommy, do you think I can get the whole stadium to start doing the Marlins cheer?” I told her, Go for it and see what happens.  She began very quietly chanting, Lets go Marlins, then she looked around and noticed that her father, brother, and I were chanting with her. She became more confident and began cheering louder. The section behind and in front of us joined in. Within moments all 25,000 people erupted in a frenzy chanting Lets Go Marlins. My daughter beamed, knowing that she ignited a spark of inspiration and passion that spread so quickly.  The healing light within each of us is so needed by our government and world. It can be ignited by each of us at any moment, in the same way that Riley started the chant that was taken up by the whole stadium. Change always occurs with one little spark: just look at Martin Luther King, Ben Franklin, Abraham Lincoln, Mother Theresa, Moses, Christ, and Buddha.  We can all take courage and strength from the immortal words of Mahatma Gandhi, Be that change you wish to see in the world. You never know, you might just be the spark that changes our collective consciousness to peace and integrity.  May you have the courage to speak your truth, may you find peace within, and may we all know peace on earth.    —Debbie Milam is a peace educator, reiki master and founder of the nonprofit organization The Creating Peace Project.

      I find that I cook differently now that my cupboard doors are back up.&nbsp; I sort of liked it with them off because it was easy to diversly conjur up a dinner from day to day because I could see everything.&nbsp;   I got&nbsp;a new indoor plant that I named Mae (for Mae West) because it has these long red fluzzy flowers that look like feather boas.&nbsp; It's pretty cool and I think it's called a Chanille.&nbsp; The plants all seem to like my east window with the morning sun.&nbsp;   And, I took a nice long bike ride, around the bay that had differing grades of hills and I found I did pretty well.&nbsp; I learned something valuable from the cycling manual that I picked up, and that is to pull up as well as push down on the pedals and it's a lot easier.&nbsp; That's because both feet are helping each other and it takes less effort.&nbsp; I can feel my knee muscles working in the lower thigh.&nbsp; I love feeling the air, and the motion, and you can go a lot farther than walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Cooking dinner now.&nbsp; Curry rice, fresh zucchini, beans, carrots&nbsp;and egg with a dash of soy sauce.  deb **

      A text of Teresa Heinz Kerry's speech as prepared for delivery Tuesday night at the Democratic National Convention:  Thank you, Christopher. Your father would be proud of you and your brothers. I love you and all our family.  My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say. And tonight, as I have done throughout this campaign I would like to speak to you from my heart.  Y a todos los Hispanos, los Latinos; a tous les Americains, Francais et Canadiens; a tutti Italiani; a toda a familia Portugesa e Brazileria; to all my continental African family living in this country, and to all new Americans: I invite you to join our conversation, and together with us work towards the noblest purpose of all: a free, good, and democratic society.  I am grateful for the opportunity to stand before you and say a few words about my husband, John Kerry, and why I firmly believe he should be the next president of the United States.  This is such a powerful moment for me. Like many other Americans, like many of you, and like even more of your parents and grandparents, I was not born in this country. As you have seen, I grew up in East Africa, in Mozambique, in a land that was then under a dictatorship.  My father, a wonderful, caring man who practiced medicine for 43 years, and taught me how to understand disease and wellness, only got the right to vote for the first time when he was 71 years old. That's what happens in dictatorships.  As a young woman, I attended Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, South Africa, which was then not segregated. But I witnessed the weight of apartheid everywhere around me. And so, with my fellow students we marched against its extension into higher education. This was the late 50s, the dawn of the civil rights marches in America.  As history records, our efforts in South Africa failed and the Higher Education Apartheid Act was passed. Apartheid tightened its ugly grip, the Sharpsville riots followed, and a short while later Nelson Mandela was arrested and sent to Robin Island.  I learned something then, and I believe it still. There is a value in taking a stand whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do. And if even those who are in danger can raise their lonely voices, isn't more required of all of us, in this land where liberty had her birth?  I have a very personal feeling about how special America is, and I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called "opinionated," is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women - who have all earned the right to their opinions - instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are.  Tonight I want to remember my mother's warmth, generosity, wisdom, and hopefulness, and thank her for all the sacrifices she made on our behalf, like so many other mothers.  This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted. It is time for the world to hear women's voices, in full and at last.  In the past year, I have been privileged to meet with Americans all across this land. They voiced many different concerns, but one they all seemed to share was about America's role in the world - what we want this great country of ours to stand for.  To me, one of the best faces America has ever projected is the face of a Peace Corps volunteer. That face symbolizes this country: young, curious, brimming with idealism and hope - and a real, honest compassion. Those young people convey an idea of America that is all about - heart and creativity, generosity and confidence, a practical, can-do sense and a big, big smile.  For many generations of people around the globe, that is what America has represented. A symbol of hope, a beacon brightly lit by the optimism of its people - people coming from all over the world. Americans believed they could know all there is to know, build all there is to build, break down any barrier, tear down any wall. We sent men to the moon, and when that was not far enough, we sent Galileo to Jupiter, we sent Cassini to Saturn, and Hubble to touch the very edges of the universe at the very dawn of time. Americans showed the world what can happen when people believe in amazing possibilities.  And, that, for me, is the spirit of America - the America you and I are working for in this election. It is the America that people all across this nation want to restore - from Iowa to California, from Florida to Michigan, from Washington State to my home state of Pennsylvania. It is the America the world wants to see, shining, hopeful, and bright once again. And that is the America that my husband John Kerry wants to lead.  John believes in a bright future. He believes we can, and we will, invent the technologies, new materials, and conservation methods of the future. He believes that alternative fuels will guarantee that not only will no American boy or girl go to war because of our dependence on foreign oil, but also that our economy will forever become independent of this need. We can, and we will, create good, competitive, and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics.  John believes that we can, and we will, give every family and every child access to affordable health care, a good education, and the tools to become self-reliant.  John Kerry believes we must, and we should, recognize the immense value of the caregivers in our country - those women and men who nurture and care for children, for elderly parents, for family members in need. These are the people who build and support our most valuable assets - our families. Isn't it time we began working to give parents more opportunity to be with their children, and to afford to have a family life? With John Kerry as president, we can, and we will, protect our nation's security without sacrificing our civil liberties. In short, John believes we can, and we must, lead in the world - as America, unique among nations, always should - by showing the face, not of our fears, but of our hopes. John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will - and he will always be first in the line of fire.  But he also knows the importance of getting it right. For him, the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength.  That is why, as president, my husband will not fear disagreement or dissent. He believes that our voices - yours and mine - must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she.  In America, the true patriots are those who dare speak truth to power. The truth we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again.  With John Kerry as president, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed. With John Kerry as president, the alliances that bind the community of nations and that truly make our country and the world a safer place, will be strengthened once more.  The Americans John and I have met in the course of this campaign all want America to provide hopeful leadership again. They want America to return to its moral bearings. It is not a moralistic America they seek, but a moral nation that understands and willingly shoulders its obligations; a moral nation that rejects thoughtless and greedy choices in favor of thoughtful and generous actions; a moral nation that leads through the power of its ideas and the power of its example. We can and we should join together to make the most of this great gift we have been given, this gift of freedom, this gift of America. In his first inaugural, speaking to a nation on the eve of war, Abraham Lincoln said, "We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."  Today, the better angels of our nature are just waiting to be summoned. We only require a leader who is willing to call on them, a leader willing to draw again on the mystic chords of our national memory and remind us of all that we, as a people, everyday leaders, can do; of all that we as a nation stand for and of all the immense possibility that still lies ahead. I think I've found just the guy. I'm married to him. John Kerry will give us back our faith in America. He will restore our faith in ourselves and in the sense of limitless opportunity that has always been America's gift to the world. Together we will lift everyone up. We have to. It's possible. And you know what? It's the American thing to do.   Goodnight and God bless. 07/27/04 23:37 EDT

      Cameroon's response to my Heaven On Earth statement:     Then why are so many people unwittingly and compulsively drawn to evil? And why do we resist "peace and love" daily? Why is evil such a powerful draw that wins innumerable 'battles' every day?    &nbsp;  What I see is;&nbsp;&nbsp;because we as a human race have not realized our full potential.&nbsp; We are still evolving.&nbsp; As individuals "awaken" and pass on their experiences through liturature and science, spiritual expression and one to one, then we as a world will amass the same spiritual experience.&nbsp;   The key is the journey of knowing ourselves, because when we know ourselves fully, we will understand others.&nbsp; Issues and battles will melt away because as we ourselves awaken, we will be able to see that our thoughts and judgements cause 'evil' to exist.&nbsp; Evil is a reaction to our perceived biases.&nbsp; Evil is not an act, but an effect of prejudiced behavior on one or more levels of awareness.&nbsp;   As more humans fully awaken, the influence of&nbsp;self awareness of the human potential will shape the outcome of the future, by nurturing the spirit of the human race.&nbsp; We can rise above the wars and power struggles of this world, personal and political.&nbsp; It is just a matter of time, and as the numbers of enlightened individuals grow, the guiding light will spread like wildfire bringing the whole to the next state of being.

      It has been said that the path of least resistance is one of sin and evil.&nbsp; I don't agree.&nbsp; Peace is a path of least resistance.&nbsp; Where there is unconditional love you will find the least resisted path.&nbsp; Evil is just varying degrees of the absence of peace and love.&nbsp;   Nature is comprised of both relatively, except it is called life and growth instead of good and evil.&nbsp; Life seeks light, and it's growth is that which seeks the path of least resistance, to overcome the obstacles that come before them.&nbsp;   Man lacks balance.&nbsp; When&nbsp; we tame the freedom of our own will, and realize that pure power comes from the heart, this world will experience the kind of peace that permeates the individual and will change life as we now know it.&nbsp;   Imagine a world with no labels, critisism or judgements.&nbsp; No reason to lie, take without asking, or hate.&nbsp; To understand each other like we know ourselves.&nbsp; To know ourselves, is the consumate journey of life.

      My house is in a perfect location.&nbsp; The west shade in the afternoon, after bathing in the fresh morning sun.&nbsp; There are many different types of birds; a young red-naped sapsucker yards above cleaning an aging cascara tree.&nbsp;   My garden is an overgrown midsummer mess, but fragrant in the settling afternoon shade.&nbsp; Sarah Brightman, an isolated sensory channel of sound on the headphones, bees alight purple cones of flowers and Grace hunts endlessly for sustenance.&nbsp; Now there is a different type of bird eating berries above me, while I dine on young Chinese Snow peas, sweet and tender burst of flavor, a tonic to my senses.   Soon the grapes will come with Fall, and the summer dream will linger into the winter shadows, the temporary bodies of flowers replenishing themselves directly in the decay of their sleep, to rise fresh with the spring.

      I would much rather go through the world alone, then attached to someone who see it only on their terms, and not considering others (except on their terms).&nbsp;   One who draws on other peoples energy and gives back a negative charge and doesn't know when to stop.&nbsp;   Why are people obnoxious?&nbsp; How did they learn that this kind of attention&nbsp;was positive in some form?&nbsp; How were their egos&nbsp;influenced as they grew to who they are now?&nbsp; I try to see them as little kids.&nbsp; Minds are fragile things.  Tonight I went out to the Scarlett Tree to see a favorite band.&nbsp; I hardly ever get a chance to go out, especially to bars, but this one I liked for the ambiance.&nbsp; And the music is exquisite.&nbsp; Your body just wants to ride the notes like sex on a magic carpet.&nbsp; I am done bringing John anywhere.&nbsp; He refuses to blend in with a crowd and draws on the energy of everyone without giving back positively.&nbsp; It is very distracting and nerve wracking.  I want to go back with someone who will appreciate the same sort of things that I do.&nbsp; I get tired of seeing everything the way others do and getting no consideration back.&nbsp; Selfish, I know.&nbsp; It's all about me.

      Placing personals is like going fishing.  It is amazing and interesting to read the diversity of responses.  Finding one you really would like to get to know, and managing to connect without him disappearing off the radar.  My problem is that I don't have a lot of money to have fun on, so I'm looking for a guy who can have fun without spending money.  I have yet to find him.  Plus I, unlike the multitude of other people, am not looking to get married or get wrapped up in a death 'til you part relationship.  I plan on leaving for parts unknown in 2011 and for a couple years at a time.  I just want to take the time I have in the here and now and make the most of it with a good person (or two or three).  At the same time I need my solitude.

      There has only been two times that I have felt great pain in the loss of someone, and david was one.  i haven't seen him since kev and i split, but i always felt a kinship with him while i was part of the family.  he was such a sweet guy.  but i know that he is in a state of peace now and will be back in memories.  i can't even fathom the pain his parents are in.

      Today I got the most horrible news, I think I've ever gotten so far in this life.  David died last night.  He was the youngest brother of my first husbands, and suffered from manic depression.  He overdosed on prescription meds.  I have never felt such pain in losing someone, and I know it is nothing compared to the pain of his parents and brothers.  I am very sad tonight.  I felt a certain kinship to him when I was part of his family.

      I have decided to take a lover, a 26 yr old from China with a PhD in Electrical Engineering.  He looks young for his age and at 39 I am the proverbial Mrs. Robinson, but he mentally has substance, and he is very thoughtful.  He says he thinks he'll learn from me.  Yee gad, I'm shaping the sex life of an individual!  I will do my best to teach him to care, but I think he will be teaching me things too.  I think we are spiritually compatable, and we are both in the prime of our sexual life.

      In the age when man became conscious, it was awe of mystery that was the catalyst of our budding awareness and man overcame his innocence through his search for meaning. Pleasure and pain became good and bad. Time began. Man recognized pattern and drew meaning from them. Day, Night, Weather, Seasons....

      I don't know why I am looking for a date.  I am content in my solitude.  There's a part of me though that is curious for that human touch, to experience others, and absorb them as a person with ideas and issues.  My solitude allows me to do this, but in turn is my only source of rejuvenation, both a sheild and strength.  I love men, they are like a favorite flower that you cannot get enough of.  they are so misinformed though.  as women and blacks were freed from the tyranny of white men, so men need to be freed from themselves.

       What an interesting movie.   I have a long vagina. They always have to use the extra long speculum to get a peep at my cervix. How can I ever expect to find someone both compatable companion and hung like a bull moose. Now that would be something.   It is the most annoying thing to even think about sex. I had it the other day and remembered how much I love it, that close most intimate contact, and he goes away thinking he did not satisfy me. I feel like I live in the eternity of a vampiress queen, the only connection to the reality of dating is a taste of imbittered flesh hardly fitting for the infinite feast of love.

      I wonder why i'm attracted to married guys?  I think it has something to do with the boundaries, and being the other woman is more preferable...more enjoyable.  there is this one who is very interesting, just in the fact that he mostly wants to correspond, and it is so much better than the dialog that other men offer.  this odd combination of cultured hunter type.  I am seduced by his anonymity.  We will see if it continues...

       Summer's chaotic end. Blackberries, like grapes of the northwest, flowers giving their soul to the fruit within. The highest form of respect is to pick it when it's in it's perfect form and appreciate them because they only come around each august. Soon enough the spiders will guard their berry treasures with their webs. The loss of light at night is noticeable, winter and another year's around the bend . To be the bee feeding on a sunflower in the warm heat of an afternoon.

      Well, I met someone from craigslist.com.  Wow.  I hope I see him again.  He impressed me with his spiritual depth and his adventuresomeness.  That and he talks and listens, cuddles after, and saw my garden as I do.  He looks like he's 45 but he is 54, but he doesn't seem like it.  I put on Sarah Brightman ... ... He found the whole afternoon erotic.  Talks about Buddha teachings a lot and has a guru, but he's definately on an even keel.  Anyway, great in bed, is open minded, and a nice fit if you know what I mean.  ;)  Got a nice curly chest of hair.  I'm not gonna hold my breath though, because men are the most unpredictable things sometimes.
