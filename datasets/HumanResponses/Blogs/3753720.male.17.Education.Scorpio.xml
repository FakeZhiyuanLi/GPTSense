      Apple presented a variety of innovations at this year's WWDC and provided information on some of the 150 new features promised to come with Tiger. For example: the next major revision to Safari, which will be bundled with Tiger when it is released in 2005, features an integrated, customizable    RSS  aggregator. The company also demoed Core Image and Core Video, which provides tools for developers that allow for the manipulation of media while freeing up processing power. Also QuickTime will support the  h.264 video standard , and the new scalable codec is said to be a cornerstone technology of Tiger. Finally, Dashboard is what Apple CEO Steve Jobs calls "Exposé for Widgets." Dashboard includes a variety of widgets, such as an iTunes controller, that allows "special tasks" to be performed quickly.         Sneak Preview Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger

      Tiger's iChat utilizes the H.264 video standard, bringing higher quality video over the same bandwidth and allowing for up to three people to video-chat at once. For those without an iSight, the new iChat also features improved audio-chatting functionality, and can be used to audio-conference with up to 10 people simultaneously.

      For people who don't know what a blog (weB LOG) is, here is the dictionary definition:  A blog is basically a journal that is available on the web. The activity of updating a blog is "blogging" and someone who keeps a blog is a "blogger." Blogs are typically updated daily using software that allows people with little or no technical background to update and maintain the blog. Postings on a blog are almost always arranged in chronological order with the most recent additions featured most prominently.

      I want to recommend a few programs that are available on the Mac and PC. For people who like simulation games. I want to recommend X-Plane by  Laminar Research .  X-Plane is the most realistic general-aviation flight-simulator ever released for personal computers. X-plane allows you to enter the geometric dimensions of your aircraft, and the experience a real-time flight simulation of that aircraft with engineering-accuracy flight dynamics. X-Plane is the first simulation to feature 3-D modeling of the entire continental United States. Features dynamic speech synthesis for verbal air traffic control communications. With support for all Gravis joysticks.  Classic version also available.   Here is a screenshot from the game:        I'm able to play X-Plane version 750 on a 933MHz iBook G4 running Mac OS 10.3 with 640MB of RAM with an ATI Radeon 9200 graphics card.   If anyone has this same setup or is using an iBook G4 you should change the texture resolution in X-Plane. Go to Options, and in the pull down menu choose "rendering." When the windows comes up change the texture resolution from "high" to "normal" so you don't push your graphics card to the limit. This will also speed the game up a bit.    X-Plane - System Requirements    Demo and Update    Please scroll down for the rest.
