      The shops by India Knight the book about how, why and where to shop. Personally I thought this was going to be a boring girlie book about shopping funny enough but to my delight when I did pick the book up, not only is it full of head nodding moments we have all been in. It is also written with a sense of humor you can't help but giggle. Even if you are on the train like myself tonight.  The main reason however I am now writing this in my blog is because this book has a good few pages dedicated to underwear including a section on 'Bras for big bosoms' and 'buy your normal - bosomed girlfriend a bra from here' and the invaluable advice, if you are unsure of sizes DO NOT BUY LARGE - great advice for anyone buying underwear as a gift.   urlLink Click here  to read more about the book

      Has Agent Provocateur gone all Forbidden Flowers by Nancy Friday on us? They are asking people to send in raunchy stories just like the book but this way you can actually win a limited edition Agent Provocateur Thruxton 900 motorbike. Feel the power between your legs is a line that instantly springs to mind!  For the rather sexy lingerie retailer this is a campaign which is sure to standout and be noticed. Got to hand it to them not a bad bit of PR although be warned on the site it is a data collection exercise as you have to join the AP club in order to enter the competition not bad as you do get email updates.  Simple but worth mentioning that work email accounts might not be the ideal for this newsletter. Also if you view this site at work and your room is quiet then note there is auto play with sound on the homepage.   urlLink Click here  to join AP Club and enter the competition   urlLink Click here  to read more about Nancy Friday and Forbidden Flowers book

       I am ecstatic. Have I died and gone to heaven? I wonder when I see the sign of my favourite lingerie store has got a 50% sale on. The adrenalin rushes as I see the shop door; my heart is in my mouth as I search the shop for the ultimate pieces of beautiful, exquisite and lavish lingerie. It's irrelevant if the piece matches anything else, fits properly or it's not my normal style; this is paradise, an Aladdin's cave of the best goodies which is better than gold. A pure moment of euphoria.

      Sara Lee-owned underwear brand Wonderbra is set to launch a new range called Deep Plunge in February 2005. This is to suit 'risque' tops and dresses but will offer support. The range follows the increasing trend into revealing clothing.  There is to be a number of styles in the range, including a bra that is transparent in the middle and has extremely low cups but still gives the 'push-up' effect. Playtex marketing director Herve Baily says the launch will be supported by significant marketing spend, with the campaign likely to appear on television.
