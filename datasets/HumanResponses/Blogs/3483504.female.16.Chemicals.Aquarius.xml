      yeah, i definitely need to never comment in my own journal ever again. it's confusing me way too much. i love talking to jeremiah. it's so fun. i like to kiss him too, hehe. omg every time i talk to him i like him better. it's so strange. i think that happened with jeremy too, but we're just friends. which kicks ass, because i can still be close to him and jeremiah at the same time. but seriously, i just don't want kristina to hurt him again. jeremy can make as many excuses for her as he wants, but that doesn't make it any better. what she's doing to him just makes me want to slap her. grrrr. but that's just my opinion. that's all it is, right? my insignificant little opinion. my opinion generally means something to my friends. but i don't expect it to mean something to everyone. hmmmm. jeremiah and i are doing stuff tomorrow. yay. my mom says i can be friends with him. but he's too old for anything else. i'm like, dude, what is he too old for? i don't see why he can be my friend and not my boyfriend. frankly, that confuses me. but it's fine, as long as i can still hang out with him under the pretense that we're just friends, i'm good. lol. i think it's rather humorous. jeremiah doesn't though, which sucks. i mean, it doesn't mean we can't be together. we just have to be a little more careful about it. not like we're having sex. not that i'm not totally tempted to, i mean come on, twelve inches is a lot. but i'm holding onto the whole virginity thing for awhile. besides, i don't think i could bring myself to actually do it until we've been with each other for at least a year. seriously, it would be far too risky. besides, this coming summer and school year are gonna be hella busy for me, and i'm not putting anything before school unless it's super important. that way i can get better grades this year. not that my grades this year were particularly bad, but i don't like having a 4.2 GPA, it needs to be higher than that. and with three ap and three honors classes next year, there's no reason why it shouldn't get higher. i very much do not intend to get anything worse than a B next year, and only like one or two of them. more than that would just mean that i'm slacking off too much, and that is very much not allowed. i hope jeremiah realizes this. like seriously, when junior year officially starts, his time with me is gonna be uber limited. school comes first. not that i mind it that much, he just probably will. he likes to able to have lots of time with me, and obviously, that hasn't been happening lately. maybe later this summer. of course, then i have volunteering and then i'm redecorating my room and shit, so who knows. meh, i'm done with my rambling, but i like typing, the clickies .. hehe. it's fun. i am far too easily amused by such trivial things.   bye dearies *muah**christina

      oooooh .... you get to pick your own stuff .... i was originally just gonna get this so that i could comment in leigh's and zoe's blogs, but i'm being sucked in. i may just post in this one too just so that i can have a kick ass url. wow .... let me tell ya. oh yeah. anyway, i'm done. i wonder if you can stick pictures into these, because i know you can't in my other two, as far as i know anyway, and i happen to have a picture of the brophy streakers, so if i can figure this crap out, i'll stick it here. :D yay now i'm excited.

DaintyDewDrop488: lol  pixxxie87: Big Red pixxxie87: that's hot CherryVixxen840: which one of us is going to post this masterpiece in our journals, lol  (*RAISES HAND* hee hee hee)  pixxxie87: he he he pixxxie87: I would pixxxie87: but my computer's retarded CherryVixxen840: damn, I'm gonna save this, though DaintyDewDrop488: Julez, you should put it in yours  pixxxie87: and save our talk about Harry CherryVixxen840: but yeah, Bill would just be like a guy who would walk up from behind you and wrap his arms around your waist and just tell you how sexy you look DaintyDewDrop488: oh yeah, that was sexy ... the roughness. oh boi CherryVixxen840: oh yea, I'll add that with it pixxxie87: it's essential:-) DaintyDewDrop488: mm can you totally picture Harry coming in from a bad Quidditch practice, sopping wet from the rain pixxxie87: AAAAHHHH!

DaintyDewDrop488: with the light from the fireplace revealing his abs and pecs  pixxxie87: ooo... CherryVixxen840: seriously, I could also see him just finding YOU in the lockerroom and start making out with you pixxxie87: yeah DaintyDewDrop488: then ripping off your clothes and just pounding you on the floor  pixxxie87: he he he pixxxie87: pounding pixxxie87: what a great adjective for rough sex pixxxie87: yay! CherryVixxen840: I think Bill would be likely to hide in the doorway of a room and pull you in as you pass by CherryVixxen840: or you walk by it together and he pulls you in CherryVixxen840: whichever works out pixxxie87: he he he CherryVixxen840: which would be really hot pixxxie87: indeed DaintyDewDrop488: wow, I want to have sex with Harry now, not Daniel Radcliffe, but the real Harry  pixxxie87: lol DaintyDewDrop488: woah Nelly  CherryVixxen840: lol, I would do them both pixxxie87: I want Rupert CherryVixxen840: I want Bill too CherryVixxen840: I'd say someone else DaintyDewDrop488: if Tom dyed his hair brown, then he would work  pixxxie87: lol CherryVixxen840: but I do not want to ruin the books for Tatum DaintyDewDrop488: but if I screamed Harry, he'd have to deal with it  pixxxie87: he he he DaintyDewDrop488: Sirius!!! ooooh  pixxxie87: HAHAHAHAHA CherryVixxen840: LOL pixxxie87: if it were Johnny CherryVixxen840: yeah, Sirius pixxxie87: wouldn't Johnny Depp be SO HOT playing him?!?!!?

DaintyDewDrop488: you kiss him really hard, and walk towards the door, turn around, and use the come hither look  pixxxie87: and then he leaps across the room and jumps on you in the dorrway DaintyDewDrop488: yeah, then he's be so hard and horny he would run after you  pixxxie87: and then you crawl to the bed CherryVixxen840: oh yeah pixxxie87: and LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!! DaintyDewDrop488: that would be like the five hour sex session  CherryVixxen840: he's probably pull you pixxxie87: like, you never separate DaintyDewDrop488: you'd both be incredibly horny and sexually frustrated, so it would go on and on  pixxxie87: you're just clawing each other on the way CherryVixxen840: or you could take a whole different approach pixxxie87: oh yeah CherryVixxen840: where in you just see him doing something CherryVixxen840: and just get his attention, nod your head toward the bedroom and walk off DaintyDewDrop488: and the first few times would be really rough and animal like, with his hand like pushing and pulling you to exactly the position he wants  CherryVixxen840: and just listen for his running footsteps pixxxie87: he he he CherryVixxen840: oh yeah, definitely CherryVixxen840: he'd want it to be fun for the both of you pixxxie87: oh yeah DaintyDewDrop488: then, after that it would be more romantic and loving  pixxxie87: slow pixxxie87: like, taking your time and just going for it DaintyDewDrop488: sweet, more about intimacy than pleasure  CherryVixxen840: yeah pixxxie87: yeah CherryVixxen840: depending on how horny you two were pixxxie87: it would change from 'i want you' to I LOVE you' DaintyDewDrop488: lots more kissing and sighing as opposed to biting and moaning/screaming  pixxxie87: lol DaintyDewDrop488: yeah  DaintyDewDrop488: oh wow, I want that ...  pixxxie87: he he he pixxxie87: which one? pixxxie87: or the whole scenario? DaintyDewDrop488: the whole thing, like the rough sex, then the gentle stuff following  CherryVixxen840: like at first, it would just be lustful passion pixxxie87: yeah CherryVixxen840: then it would get romantic DaintyDewDrop488: who else would be really good .... that guy  DaintyDewDrop488: yeah I think we do pixxxie87: which guy? DaintyDewDrop488: well, we are bossom buddies lol  pixxxie87: yay!!!! CherryVixxen840: I still think Lucius Malfoy would be awesome CherryVixxen840: in the fact that he'd give you chills pixxxie87: he be the type to tell you 'if you move, I'll stop' DaintyDewDrop488: the guy who plays profession quidditch but still is in school ... I think that was in the fourth book so nevermind pixxxie87: so of course it would be SO much better DaintyDewDrop488: lol I wouldn't like that  CherryVixxen840: OLIVER WOOD!!! pixxxie87: by the way, it is pixxxie87: it's hard DaintyDewDrop488: nooo ... but he would be good pixxxie87: but it's worth it in the end DaintyDewDrop488: he isn't developed enough as a character to really know though  pixxxie87: the quidditch captain? CherryVixxen840: yeah pixxxie87: well CherryVixxen840: Oliver Wood pixxxie87: he did say'you'd make a fair beater' DaintyDewDrop488: but since he's so into the quidditch thing, he'd probably be more mellow in bed because he puts so much energy into sports  DaintyDewDrop488: lol  pixxxie87: that could have some sexual connotations... pixxxie87: mellow is good DaintyDewDrop488: but he said that to Harry  pixxxie87: it would last longer pixxxie87: yeah pixxxie87: but he still said it pixxxie87: :-) DaintyDewDrop488: yeah, I mean, I think he could get kinky too, but more often he'd be slower  DaintyDewDrop488: lol  DaintyDewDrop488: Fred and George are definitely the kinkiest pixxxie87: oh yeah CherryVixxen840: yeah CherryVixxen840: they'd have such kinky sex DaintyDewDrop488: I think they might be the best combo, except for Harry lol  pixxxie87: you could have quickies all the time 'cause of the map CherryVixxen840: like Tatum said, they'd feel you up under the table DaintyDewDrop488: oh yeah, the two of em together  pixxxie87: they could say, 'hurry up, so and so pixxxie87: is coming' pixxxie87: oh yeah! DaintyDewDrop488: and then they'd find a secret hallway and shag you in a way you never dreamed possible  pixxxie87: yeah pixxxie87: that would be like, they DaintyDewDrop488: ooh one could be the look out while the other is humping ...  (Christina...you little minx...)  CherryVixxen840: LOL CherryVixxen840: switch DaintyDewDrop488: they would come up with all these cool little magical sex toys  DaintyDewDrop488: yup pixxxie87: would have to carry you back to your dorm after 'cause they'd wear you out so bad pixxxie87: never had that happen... CherryVixxen840: oh yeah, that would be fun pixxxie87: ...but I'll bet it's nice:-) DaintyDewDrop488: they also might get into a bit of a fight over whose turn it was to fuck you, at which point they'd wrestly  CherryVixxen840: and man, Harry has his invisibility cloak DaintyDewDrop488: *wrestle  DaintyDewDrop488: it'd be so hot  CherryVixxen840: AND now has posession of the map pixxxie87: OMG pixxxie87: but then what if you stumbled pixxxie87: you'd fall out of it and be exposed pixxxie87: or just random arms and legs would pop out here and there DaintyDewDrop488: holy crap, having sex pinned against a cold stone castle wall underneath the cloak  CherryVixxen840: oh he'd have a firm grip on you CherryVixxen840: OMG!! HOT pixxxie87: but then again, that could bring the whole 'hold still' thing into play DaintyDewDrop488: risque, yet intriguing  CherryVixxen840: is the cloak that long, lol CherryVixxen840: it has fit 3 people under it before CherryVixxen840: so...maybe DaintyDewDrop488: and Snape catches you two, so you head over to his office later for a little ... persuading to get you out of trouble  pixxxie87: you see these feet kind of moving back and forth against a wall pixxxie87: that would be funny DaintyDewDrop488: lol  pixxxie87: and it's not sound proof pixxxie87: so you'd have to be quiet DaintyDewDrop488: which would make it even better because you're trying to restrain yourself  pixxxie87: yeah pixxxie87: that is awful DaintyDewDrop488: and then the moans that do get out would be so much sexier  pixxxie87: in a good way pixxxie87: that's the worst DaintyDewDrop488: which part? lol  pixxxie87: when they tell you to hold still and be quiet pixxxie87: it's so bad pixxxie87: it's great at the end pixxxie87: but it's so hard to not move or make noise DaintyDewDrop488: I bet it's torture though  pixxxie87: it is pixxxie87: but the end result is SO much stronger, if you catch my drift pixxxie87: :-)  There was more but Julez edited the other stuff out because that was more private convo, or it would be too confusing for you. *so sexy!!*

        urlLink     I'm getting there.  I don't suck, but I've got a ways to go.   Not too bad, but you can do better. Keep working on it- maybe try kicking a few guys wherever you want to, then start lighting them on fire. Slow and steady wins the race, okay? You've got a long way to go, but I think you'll survive.   lol, if this doesn't work I'll be pissed. This quiz is sooo funny.

      "To the most lovely, the most dear, The Angel, and the deathless grail Who fill my heart with radiance clear - In immortality all hail." -- Charles Baudelaire   "There is joy in the presence of the angels." -- Bible - Luke 15:10   Well, today has been just so amazingly tumultuous, I wanted to cry/scream so many times, it sucked. But it's ok now. Everybody keeps asking, and yes, I'm fine, no worries. Everything has been taken care of. I'm not freaking out anymore, so now I can bask in the loveliness that is ... love. lol it really is that great too. Like, after all the pain I've been through with him, I know that I could handle actually giving birth as long as he is around, because he just makes it so much easier. I doesn't hurt any less, but it's easy to forget the pain once it's over. So wonderful. By the way, I apologize that this is all I seem to talk about lately, it actually isn't all I think about, but most of everything else is about Chemistry, and I'm sure that doesn't interest you all in the slightest. So once school is over I'll get to everything else. And there's lots, so don't worry, it's worth the wait. Well, that's all I have to say right now, my entries will be so incredibly lengthy after Friday, you'll get sick of it. But that's what you get. :)   I'm having another great conversation with Laura, thanks sweetie!! It makes me feel so much better about stuff. And Tatum, thank you for reassuring me, I don't know what I would do without you. Your friendship means so much to me!! Nicole!! I don't know what to say, you've been great. You and Timmy, and me and Isaac, it's so cool/weird/amazing. Ivanna is so funny. I felt so bad for her about the Vegas incident. I would have died. *shiver* creepy guys. I love that kid, I don't know why, but I've grown attached/protective of her. And Marija!! Fun stuff. Those stupid girls at Xavier though ... we should like, do something to them. lol. I feel evil today. And yet, so angelic at the same time. hmmm  *muah**christina

        I  guess I'll update now, although I'm not really sure why. Things are good between Jeremiah and I. Things are okay with my parents. I think my mom is going to either send in my tuition tomorrow, or take it over on Monday after picking me up from work. Either way I should get my schedule soon! wooohooo. And my mom is freaking out about my summer reading books because we haven't even bought them yet, so I guess she's planning on doing that tomorrow. ewww, school is way too close for comfort. Two month Anniversary tomorrow. Birthday August 1. I have a bunch of shopping that I need/want to do soon. Once I get my schedule I want to buy some of my supplies and shit so that I don't have to wait until the last minute. Maybe I'll attempt to buy some crap to actually organize my locker this year, maybe not. I'm writing this more for me than anyone else actually, just thinking and writing it all down.    J eremiah's been doing stuff with Scott now that he's no longer a threat to himself or anyone else and therefore out of the hospital, and hopefully this will help him snap out of this whole thing.    I  have some gossip about some bells people, but it's not something to be mentioned here. Just kind of interesting and it popped into my head. Actually, now that I think about it, I have gossip on lots of bells people, but again, nothing to be divulged at this point in time. Maybe years from now, when bells is over for me and the people I'll tell it to. Maybe not.    I  was just reading my GQ and Amy was listening to her new CDs loudly, so I heard the music. It was really good. Naturally my taste in music is incredibly influenced by her. She's the one who got me into Queen, Bowie, Eisley, bunches of stuff. Not Billie, Letters to Cleo, POE, and some other stuff though. hmmm, although she did contribute to the whole Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys obsession, I must say. Just something humorous to mull over I guess.    I 've recently become addicted to Yahoo Pool ... kind of sad really. My computer does not like this new hobby, and just to make sure I know that, it has started randomly closing the pool game windows, and, more dramatically, giving me the blue screen of death. grrr, I think my computer has some of that adware or spyware shit on it. That wouldn't surprise me. However, we probably won't get it fixed until it really starts screwing stuff up. As long as I can still get online and write papers for school, it's all good. Actually, it'll probably need to be fixed before, or in early, September because I've been using Amy's printer for stuff, and I'm going to really need a working printer after she's gone. Since it's actually just my computer that's not letting me print, I think, we should get it fixed. That's my logical deduction, however I have no clue when it comes to these things.    T hat said, I hereby conclude today's post.  Happy My Anniversary!!!!  love to all    &nbsp;  btw, I'm loving the new stuff that I get to do with fonts and stuffs.     &nbsp;

      I'm updating here instead of my live journal because, frankly, I really just want to talk to Mimi about the current shit, and there are a bunch of people I don't want seeing this.   So Carrie, Jenny, and Jer are all at his house right now. I was supposed to come, but my dad said that I need to stay home today, God knows why. Zane is supposed to be going too, but when I called he wasn't there yet. Now, it's not that I don't trust Jer, I don't trust Jenny. So after agonizing over it for a few minutes, I called him back and told him that. He said he would call Scott and have him come over and "save him" because I'm uncomfortable about it. Well, that made me feel better for awhile, but I think I'm in a weird mood right now. I think some of the weirder things about me are starting to get on his nerves. Like my exhibitionism. He said he would post details about Monday in his journal, but then after I told him to because he hadn't yet, he wrote in his journal that he didn't want to because it's just the way he is about his sex life. Ok, I don't know why he couldn't just tell me that, but ok. My parents' overprotectiveness gets to him, I know that. I think my difficulty with trusting people is beginning to show through now. It's been there since the end of seventh grade, but I try to push it away and just be laid back about everything. But at times, mostly just when I'm in such a relationship, it kicks back in and becomes rather overwhelming. So here I am, just plain feeling like shit. I don't like this, I want to be there in his arms, but I can't and she can, and that freaks me out. I know that I need to trust more, but after seeing what happened with Jenny and Mimi, and then the whole Biltmore thing, I don't trust her worth shit. And I feel kinda bad about that, but still. I've become far too vulnerable in this whole thing, and it really just makes me cry. I'm scared, I try to keep myself out of situations in which I could easily get hurt (actually, betrayed is more like it) but I've fallen in love. I feel exposed, because he can see my worst traits and he can hurt me more than anyone else. I think I'm gonna go lay down, take a nap, cry a bit. I hate this. But I love him. Oh fuck, my hands are shaking. I need you Mimi. I hope things are going better in Washington than they are here.
