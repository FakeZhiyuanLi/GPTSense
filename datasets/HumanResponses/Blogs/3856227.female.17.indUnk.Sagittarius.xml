      14 days to go..until 2 Emily Cr.!!!!! i am so excited.. on a brighter note..[[ahem here comes my damn sarcasm]] i`m still really pissed about phil..i erased him out of my buddy list..even tho i keep checkin if he`s online..and keep checkin his away messages..can i BE anymore needy and pathetic like chandler of course before he met monica..hahah that lucky fuck..i wish life couid be all like that..meet a friend..become best friends..then marry yer best friends..then all you have to worry about is gettin a baby..because you kno..yall already got great jobs like head chef and a vP at some accountant company..oK i think i`ve been watching friends too loong now.. i went to the franklin institute today..it was gay as shit..i didn`t enjoy it one bit..all i did was hold hands with two kids and walked around and saw some boring shits..we didn`t even get to see the titanic thing..wtf! i came home all tired and hungry bc they didn`t give us teachers a damn time to eat shit..wtf..seriously -[[sigh]] i duno what we`ve scheduled to do tomorrow..i`m finally gonna clean up my closet and hang all my clothes up..i mean we`re not boxing clothes..just carrying them in the car and hanging them up straight from the car..so i better start pickin up all the dirty shirts and clean them up..only 2 weeks left..i can`t believe it..we`re finally moving..hahaha i think that`s the only joy in my life right now..bc i have all this pressure of reading 5 books for school..and then tryna get varsity in tennis..damn i hope i get a position..cuz bein in jV when yer a senior is just pathetic..that`s what i think..but if i get jV..i`ll still have fun with miso and jenny..hahahha way to encourage my friends!

      i talked to phil last night..everything`s really over now..hahaha it couldn`t be any more clear..apparently he met a girl..from illinois..and "i wish you were here" in his profile was not meant in anyway towards me..i just misunderstood..again and again.. i know i never really "went out" with him..but i thought we were goin somewherer with our lil thing in between us..i guess that was another misinterpretation i had.. i`m not hurt..or at least i don`t think i am..hahah am i in denial? the truth is..i really wanted this to happen..not just something that i NEEDED to have just because it was a guy..i really liked him i think..he was really sweet..and now he`s just gone like that.. not the first time this happened..i mean lettin a guy just float away from me..i have the BEST timing with guys..first they like me..and then i freak out..and then i calm down and begin to like them..then i get really into them..then they start fading away from me..story of my life

      today was so sad..4 year olds from our academy went up to an older level..aww im gonna miss them so much..i wanted to cry..im gonna miss so many of them [[sniffle sniffle]] anyhoo..i talked to jeroh today for like 2 seconds..hahaha i was about to beat him up but he grabbed my arm..haha twerp..i love him..he`s so cute..hehe so i havent talked to my brother for 5 days now..this is hilarious..i`ve never not talked to him for this long..let`s see how long it`s gonna go..unless he apologizes..i aint gonna do shit for him..with him..or nothing..he keeps askin to playin tennis but nooo he gotz to apologize faggot..hahaha o yea i am soo mature!! yepp!! so the double "date" im supposed to go out on turned out to a total scam..hahhaa seul-gi said that it was hyung-suk "oppa"..i duno what to call him..she calls him that..but he`s married and has two babies..but he`s still kinda young..hahha i duno..it`s kinda gross if you call him oppa but seul-gi calls everyone oppa so i guess i really dunt care..we`re supposed to go out for some sushi this tuesday for lunch..i haven`t had sushi for 17 gillion years so im excited..yea!!hahaha phil has a pentathalon today..right now i guess..i hope he wins..it`d be nice if he had something to brag about infront of me for a bit..hahaha since i told him i liked michael phelps..he called him a freak..hahaha it was so cute and funny..i think he was jealous..hahahhaa so i did a little college search again..bc i have so many things to do like that..yepyep..temple doesn`t seem so bad now..it has a popular major of elementary education..and it`s cheaper than penn state..i did NOT know that..so i`m gonna talk to dad about it..although he doesn`t seem like he likes temple very much..o well..i`m really not sure if i can get into penn state main..and pitt doesn`t have elementary education as their majors..which sucks..so my next choice would be temple..i really wanted to go to pitt for some reason..but then again they don`t have my major..so i really shouldn`t go there [[sigh]] i wish there were more good in-state schools which have elemetary education majors..but i guess there aren`t..so we`ll see how this college thing will take me startin in september..hopefully mrs. gates and i will figure it out.. i hate my sat score..1220 does not seem too high for any of the school that i wanna apply to except temple..i mean it`s at a reasonable state for every school such as penn and pitt..but it`s at the bottom so it`s not really safe..God help me!!
