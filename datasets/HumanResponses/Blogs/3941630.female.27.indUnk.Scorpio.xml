        Welcome to my blog!  What a night to start blogging.  My mom will be in town tomorrow and my baby boy will turn 1 Wednesday. I would like to post a picture of the little cutie but I have yet to figure out how.  Keep checking back as I'm sure that I'll figure it out soon enough.  If all else fails I'll do what I know best, ask my husband!     So lately I've found that I needed an outlet for all the "stuff inside" and thought I could just blog it out.  That being said I don't even have a clue where to begin.  Life has been a bit of a test lately.  I'm feeling the need to start getting back to me.  You see, after the birth of my son I pretty much put myself on hold for the year.  Only recently have I felt the need to start taking myself back.  I'm finally in a position to take care of myself and my family simultaneously.  So the adventure begins...      I've always found summertime to be the time of year that I feel the most alive.  I seemingly have energy to do it all.  Lately that energy has been focused on remodeling our home.  We have almost completed a full paint job from ceiling to floor and now comes the adventure of baseboards.  I've opted for the traditional English look (5 3/4 board) which presents a challenge but will keep me from having to repair a one inch section of drywall above the standard 4 inch board.  The previous owners were kind enough to completely screw up everything they touched so each remodeling project is quite an undertaking.  I find myself repairing and then remodeling.  For instance, our guest bathroom.  The PO's painted the walls two different shades of the same color - this was an accident not an attempt at decorating.  They used a semi-gloss paint and then touched up with a high gloss.  You can only imagine how that looked.  They wallpapered a boarder across the top and used masking tape (which they left on the wallpaper) as a protector to paint the walls without getting the paint on the wallpaper.  That's right, they wallpapered and then painted.  After they were done doing that stellar job they continued onto repairing the caulking.  A white non paintalble caulk was used and smeared everywhere.  I've never seen such a job!  I've spent the past two months with a straight razor in my hand removing their caulk job.  I could go on for pages here but I'll finish with the real kicker and let your imaginations do the rest.  When they were painting the bathroom they PAINTED EVERYTHING.  Every door hinge, handle, locking mechanism, lightbulb etc had paint on it.  The door has so much that we are having to replace all the hardware as it won't shut properly.  Anyway, I've just realized that I've been ranting about the most absurd stuff and for those of you that are still with me I applaud your ability to stay interested in the mundane and welcome you to my favorite past time. Ranting tantrums about seemingly unimportant events.  Welcome to my blog!

      Ha I say to the Bon Bon GODS! As I got in my car and headed to the gym I knew that I had a narrow window of opportunity to workout before my son would be hungry and ready for his morning nap and I was determined to burn off at least one layer of butt fat. As we arrived at the gym I noticed the entrance was blocked and there were a line of cars waiting to get in. Upon further investigation I realized that a gigantic flatbed semi with a back-ho resting on top was stuck on the driveway. The bottom of the truck had literally ground into the cement and was jammed. Brilliant! The gym is undergoing massive renovation so this explains the reason the truck was there in the first place however, he had managed to get stuck in just a way so to block all incoming and outgoing traffic through the only entrance/exit. At this time one begins to wonder how much determination and discipline they really have. Does one say fine, guess I just wasn't meant to workout today and I didn't really want to anyway? - which is what I did several times in my head while waiting in hopes for one of the construction workers to render the situation hopeless. No... I didn't succumb to this easy way out. Connor and I sat patiently for about 20 minutes waiting. Other moms desperate for a break from their little ones and in hopes of returning to their "pre-pregnancy size" sat with me getting more desperate by the minute. Some gave up and sped away agitated at the whole situation while a few sat unified thinking that somehow if we stare hard enough our piercing laser eyes would burn holes unto the flatbed truck and it would miraculously move. No you may be wondering, why didn't you just find alternative parking. Well it's difficult to explain but the gym sits next to a field on one side, train tracks, and has the back of a neighborhood on the other (literally the privacy fence so no parking here). My option was to park across the street down an alley and jaywalk across a busy four lane street with no crosswalk. So after giving up on the hopelessly comical situation that's just what I did! As I ventured toward the gym I could feel the victory smile creeping across my face. Once again I beat Mr. Procrastination and Mr. I don't have enough time. One more day that I can mark down as a cardio success story. I got Connor settled into the daycare and headed off to the treadmill only to realize I had left my headphones at home. Guess I still need to work on conquering Mr. Opps I forgot!  oh and just a little footnote... as I pounded away on the treadmill I watched the construction workers fumble around for another 30 minutes with that damn truck before they finally got it moved!

      My baby boy woke up in one of the worst moods today. There are very few times you will catch me on edge due to him but OMG really? The phenomenon of the toddler baffles me. Connor has been in this "daddy is a god" phase and while it's adorable, it's also terribly exhausting. I can go a whole day caring for my son and he's fine, then daddy walks in the door and he has a complete and total meltdown. I mean if Joey isn't there to pick him up and coddle him every second this child freaks. So this morning Joey got up to care for Connor at about 8 a.m. and the baby hasn't stopped whining yet. The rule goes like this, if Joey is within 1 ft of Connor and looking directly at him at all times we are fine. BUT... if he turns his head, takes a seat, step, breath, or hiccup it's all over! Now if you don't have a little one in your home then you may not fully understand what I'm talking about. The whining I'm referring is what I like to call the 'almost cry'. It comes at you in 4 second spurts with one split second of hopeful silence in between. This isn't the first time Connor has produced this cancer causing sound however, it is the only sound in his arsenal which drives me to utter frustration. I can take repeated No's! I can take a full on crying tantrum but the 'almost cry', that's his trump card. I feel a bit guilty about my frustration but I'm just not used to that behavior from my son. I don't understand where it comes from as there is no predictability behind it. The only common factor is Joey. You would think that he woke up in the morning and covered himself in a sugar spread the way this kid is drawn to him. My poor husband does the best that he can, he really does. However, a man can only take so much. Joey has had to adjust to walking in the door at night and switching immediately to dad mode with barely a second to even set down his puter and breath. At last silence! I don't hear a baby. On any normal day this would send me running throughout the home trying to find what my child has gotten into next but today, I find it quite soothing. Happy Sunday.

      Well I have come to the conclusion that a blog is just a diary.  Obviously I edit it a little knowing that my friends and family may view it from time to time.  Only one person knew of this website until now but I have decided to open it up and see what happens.  I'm suprised to realize that I'm a bit nervous.  And to think, I haven't even written anything juicy and scandalous yet!  Anyway, here's to my launch!  Hope you find as much humor in this as I do.

      I took my mom to the airport last night and the adventure has come to a close.  Over 300 photos were taken the past two weeks and hundreds of miles put on the car.  It was really great to have my mom in town to share in my day to day life with me.  She was the first family member to come out and see the new house and she loved it. Yea!      I hope that she had a great time as I know I did.  We traveled out to some area lakes, bought homemade apple pie from farmers, through the birthday party of the year and even made a day trip to Yosemite.  What a beautiful place.  I find myself once again with the renewed vigor to make some changes around here.  What they are and when they will occur has yet to be seen.  All I know is that I've been in a rut lately and I'm bored of it.  It's time to take back me!  This is a good thing though, a breath of fresh air if you will.  Thanks to my mom I'm remembering the me I like to be.
