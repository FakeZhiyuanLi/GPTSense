      I just watched a documentary called "unsolved history" and in this episode it dealt with the JFK footage of people who were there, trying to "solve history".  I find the whole JFK was assinated debate hilarious. No, I do not ligthen the fact that a man was murdered, and that it was horrific. We all know about brain salad on Jackies clothing. I can respect the horror-factor. What I cannot respect, however, are all the wild speculations that are adamantly spouted about it, many of them from mouths who were not even CONCIEVED at the time of the "grassy gnoll" moment in history.  I was not born until 1978. My mother however, was THERE, on a field trip with her then-class, and she used to tell her side of things, and show me the bullet graze on her right calf, from where the fatal bullet suppsedly sprang forth. Whether or not that is the truth or the whole tale, I don't care. The reason this whole thing irks me is simple:  I have read DETAILED life histories (many of it is now public information) on Lee Harvey Oswald. The man was not only a social retard and a mental degenerate, he was INCAPABLE of living on his own, lived with his mother, and had SERIOUS mental issues. Also, at the time of all the JFK hoopla, it was nigh IMPOSSIBLE for a civilian to get ahold of the kind of rifle used to turn JFK's head into a punchbowl of speculation. Simply not plausible by any stretch of the imagination. Also, the power and range and scope of sniper-rifles back then, and even TODAY, all fall prey to the one absolute rule of law in the cosmos: PHYSICS. The primate idiots who say the window in the book depository was the location, are complete retards, for the simple fact that winshear, gravity, distance, and terminal velocity all fuck the theories in the ass.  Finally, in closing this little rant, I'd like to say: The guy is dead. He is not coming back. No one will EVER be brought to justice for his "murder", so why not solve the mystery of yetis or why Oj Simpson isn't dead?

      Today I have just been thinking about why I write so many poems, and their frequency to shape themselves in such rapid succession. I have always written poems, but I have always done so in marathon sessions. I will write 10 or 15 in one sitting, then not write for weeks, days, or even once, for months. It is odd to me. Sometimes the ideas just come and I have to get them out or I will go insane. Although writing is something I enjoy, sometimes it feels like it is more a part of me than I thought at one time that it was.  I have too many ideas to write down I suppose...

      I have come to the conclusion that VH1 is the final sign of the end of the world. Case in point:  First, we get shows like Real World, on MTV, which, if one is honest with themselves, IS NOT THE REAL WORLD.  Then we have the "survivor" inanity on CBS which, if surviving in the Australian outback was as easy as "who ate the cans of beans, you fag" then it would be a far different place today than it is, meaning the King and his curstsies would never have infected it...  Now, VH1 has gone and made a series of shows about "the best of this or that" from whatever corresponding year of nostalgia their execs can okay for production. People on these shows, many of them INVISIBLE to me at all (they aren't always named), seem to have the final word on things, but who the FUCK are these people really? Some of them I recognize as extra's from COUNTLESS shitty hollywood staples such as "twisted sister", which incidentally was NOT before my time, but unfortunately is the cultural train wreck that leaves columbine somehow...comical. Another is that latin-american man who was steppe don in Jurassic Park: The Lost World, and who, incidentally, has vanished since, but has at LEAST 15 minutes of "in the know" about 1987. Who gives a fuck?  Tonights desecent into corporate ratings-gathering, aimed at people lost in their personal mecca-decade, was about racial misconceptions in tv history. uh....  a) It has been, and always WILL BE, like this, period.  b) The people on the show are KNOWN to be QUOTED saying racist things (those still having valid careers)  c) They made some seriousl warped and outlandish claims on tv which, if called to task, should commence the flogging  d) it was a waste of 1 hour of television broadcast time that, in the end, won't earn them an emmy or anything else except yet ANOTHER cultural train wreck.  e) it has no meaning beyond the people who sit at home, paint their nails black, and collect coffee table books about the 80's and the styles of that time period.  I suppose in the end, it all boils down to "popular culture". It isn't popular to everyone....

      We are raising some very desensitized people now days. Death, crime and the criminal attitude are things of everyday life, and it is popular with children and adults. The expected and submitted to stress levels in most work environments along with the accepted cut throat attitudes toward promotions and success, all create cycles of quiet social abuse and personal resentment toward others and ourselves. We are creatures of imagination. People that require solitude to relax will fantasize about a situation that is bothering them until they feel better about it, even if they have to change the outcome within the fantasy. Violence is socially acceptable on one level, but not in others. We are inundated with violence on television, songs, newspapers and so on, but, we are not allowed to punch some jerk who probably deserves it for fear of being arrested or worse, sued. This creates resentment in some people that is hard to control. A week does not go by where we do not see somebody ream an employee or public servant for some minor infraction. Manners, basic human respect and compassion seem to have been erased from a large amount of people’s lives. Not long ago in my favorite grocery store a perfectly respectable looking woman, dressed well with an expensive wedding band on her hand could not get her credit card to work. So, what does she do? She calls my favorite cashier a ‘stupid little dumb ass’. I chuckled because I know one thing about people who are rude to people in uniforms. They only do it because they think they can get away with it. They are conditioned to believe in their weak little minds to believe that the manager is going to give them what they want anyway. She gave me a nasty look and was surprised by the fact that I was staring her in the eyes. I said in a friendly voice, "What a nasty little desensitized, undereducated and mannerless waste you are." Than I smiled at her. I would not stop looking at her and the people behind me got to snickering. So, she huffed out of the store and was gone without another word. I turned my attention back to the cashier and saw humor, but looking closer. I saw hatred as she made small talk and occasionally glanced at the door that the woman had exited. This cashier is a sweet, polite and quiet woman, but the stress of the idiot customer’s unwarranted insult touched something dark in her. We all have a dark side. We are all capable of murder. We have only been conditioned not to be. But, in our society, that conditioning is becoming thin.  The movie "Silence of the Lambs" was a great box office hit, but the sequels did not showcase the FBI agents, they showcased the Monster. Hannibal is the one that created ticket sales. The public in a very personal way is fascinated by the serial killer. We become curious about things that we do not fully understand. We develop interests in things that we respect, not in things that terrify us.  We are creating the perfect environment for the ultimate serial killer.  Imagine the killer who has no concern with notoriety. The killer who has the sense to never leave a signature and is killing for the pure satisfaction of being the best. A driven desensitized competitor who’s only drive is to attain his or her goal of being the very best serial killer. A business minded person who goes after his or her goals with the same zest that most inspirational speakers attempt to inspire into their audiences. Strange idea, but not so far fetched in today’s society. We push our children to be the very best, but the typical public school doesn’t give them the skills to read well, much less go on to attain what our society deems success. They are set up to suffer disappointment and confusion.  The serial killer is created in a mixture of psychological and physical experiences in an environment that is not well understood. We do know that this cocktail is of a negative nature, sometimes containing abuse and certain behaviors and sometimes not, but the end result is a person with limited conscience and an irrational sense of entitlement, a person who is capable of rationalizing their negative behavior. You know, the typical college student.  I do not want anybody to develop a fear of young people, but the environment that we have created for our young to grow up and develop in gives the possible serial killer all the tools he or she needs to do a good job. We even glorify the brilliance and the horror of the actions committed by the legendary serial killers.  The ultimate serial killer will be too good to be caught, and will have enough disappointment and hate to keep him or her pressing on to an established goal. His or her hate will not be directed toward the abusive parent or the bullies on the playground, it will be directed at society itself.

The new one, called "Unhidden Descent" will be a gallery destination for all my photography work, both digital and otherwise. Gallery one has my recent snow day pics, and gallery two has all the pictures of me that I have amassed during my most boring, and candid, moments. Gallery #3 will showcase my scenes captured throughout daily life, in places both beautiful and disturbingly haunting. Gallery #4 will be misc stuff, and gallery #5 will be announced in due time. For right now, I am uploading the skeletal features, and galleries #1, and #2. Stay tuned. Menu item "stock" will apear on the decadence site soon...

      I am a complex individual. My proclivities are so varied, that is somewhat difficult for me to extrapolate upon myself and ever feel satisfied I have completed it fully.   I think too much. This is not a bragging thing, it is a damn curse. I ponder pretty much anything to the point of tedium, whereby I desire kicking my own ass. When something is wrong with my life, in whatever capacity, I react to it in ways most people find silly or unfathomable. Rather than destroy my brain cells with booze or snorting glue sticks, I write, both poetry and music. It keeps me from killing myself I suppose. On some level, thats a copout, but not all the time.   When someone does something to harm me and mine, I usually will never let it go. I do not go postal, but that perso is always left wondering where I am and if i am up to something  I don't get "even" but the implied idea that I might makes people squirm. The threat of force is often-times for villifying that actual force, according to Grand Moff Tarkin (snicker).   I enjoy beautiful things. Beautiful things are considered to be various items according to who you speak with. Items of beauty to me are the following:   A man who has lost his family, his home, his car etc, and has nothing to lose, who goes for his enemies and destroys them, and, ultimately, himself, but this has beauty in it, poetically.   Storms are beautiful to me.   Righteous anger, not overkilled, and legit, is a beautiful, and powerful thing. I has changed history, and has reshaped entire cultures.   Poetry is universally beautiful to me as well.   I guess I am just a wanton bleeding heart poet with too much free time...

       ::)  What is the fucking deal man? Why is it that when I have one of my bad days, and everything that CAN happen, DOES happen, am I made to feel guilty for being upset about it? What the fuck is wrong with people?  I woke up this morning and stubbed me FACE, not my toe, on my lamp, then I slipped and busted my nads on the shower, then I BURNED my breakfast and THEN, just when I felt it couldn't become any more shit encrusted of a day, some jackass KEYED my new paint job on my vehicle! SONOFABITCH!  I am out and about during the rest of the day, running errands, and this soccer mom from HADES decides to pass in front of my in my lane no more than a FOOT from my fucking license plate! I had to swerve to miss the crusted cuntfuck and then I hit a pylon. Now my wheel alignment is all shot to fucking ELL, and I have no recourse save a new tire and get my alignment fixed.  I arrive home and the STUPIDS who are groundskeepers here are spraying for hornets and have my DOOR open, so it smells like industrial pollutants in my home, and I have dead hornets all over the floor near my fireplace!  I want to strangle someone....

      What is the driving force that makes some people utterly devoid of brain cells? I mean seriously? Is being a complete idiot with no hope of a better future a choice? Or, more profoundly, is it genetic? I continue to experience the stygian depths to which a person will go for some ego-enhancing stunt at my or someone else's expense, and I just want to throtlle some people!  I was in the grocery store and this woman was behind me. She asked me in a seductive tone if I would spare her some space in my "ride" to take her to the gas station. My initial response was one of chagrin, because I was on the spot with a strange female. Then I realized the station she wished to travel to was HALF a minute away. I instinctually thought of something dangerous in her request, then proceeded to, as politely as possible, tell her no.  She did not respond well to being "told".  I have to admit, the woman was quite striking, and any man who had no moral fiber in him would have no doubt hopped at the chance to be alone with this "hawtee". But for me, I have more to think about than my dick, so I decided against it all. She proceeded to accuse me of being 'sexist' and yadda yadda yadda. it went on for about 3 minutes before I turned and said "no, crusty cunt, i have nothing against women, or their societal stature, you're just a whore looking for man meat. Go fuck the stockers or find a treelimb to rip your pelvic region on".  She went APESHIT. I could not control my laughter, and the woman was escorted out of the store. The funny things is, I was next in line, and had exact change, so I got out faster than I had hoped (checkers can be...slow in the head).  Case in point: If you don't know someone, and they ask such a thing, ignore them or kick them in the forhead...

      Ahmad Al Halabi, 25, has been charged with spying and misuse of classified information while a translator at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the military base where the United States maintains a prison camp for suspected al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.  He is quoted in the same article I read all about him in, as saying the following:  "I also have a fiance and my relationship may collapse due to lack of communications," Halabi wrote in a filing made public this week.  Um, shouldn't the fucking moronic minion have thought this through BEFORE he became a spy for the enemy of his country? The issue of war or no war is moot here, we ARE at war, and this buckethead with a kneeling carpet decided to act in that fashion, and now worries for his "potentially failed marriage aspirations"?

      COMEDIANS ON KERRY   "The White House begun airing their TV commercials to  re-elect the president, and the John Kerry campaign is  condemning his use of 9/11 in the ads. He said, it is  unconscionable to use the tragic memory of a war in  order to get elected, unless of course, it's the Vietnam War."  - Jay Leno   "John Kerry has promised to take this country back from the  wealthy. Who better than the guy worth $700 million to take  the country back? See, he knows how the wealthy think. He  can spy on them at his country club, at his place in Palm  Beach, at his house in the Hamptons. He's like a mole for  the working man." - Jay Leno   "I'm worried about John Kerry, he's so confident now that  he's already planning his White House sex scandal."  - David Letterman   "John Kerry will be the Democratic nominee for president.  Democrats finally found someone who is Al Gore without the  flash and the sizzle." - Craig Kilborn   "Kerry has already begun his search for a running mate.  They say that because John Edwards still has $50 million in  campaign money, Kerry might pick him. Pick him? Hey, for  $50 million, Kerry will change his position on gay marriage  and marry him." - Jay Leno   "An Internet report claims that John Kerry had an affair  with a young woman, but that she still loves him and will  deny it. When asked if this was similar to the  Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, a spokesman said 'Close, but no  cigar.'" - Jimmy Fallon, Saturday Night Live   "Over the weekend, John Kerry - the big John Kerry  juggernaut moves on - he won primaries in Washington D.C.,  Nevada and, I think, Canada. And he's so confident that  he's started nailing that intern again." - David Letterman   "The head of the AFL-CIO endorsed John Kerry, saying, 'The  time has come to come behind one man, one leader, one  candidate.' Then he said, 'And until we find that man, we  will have to endorse John Kerry.'" - Conan O'Brien   "The Democrats are all over this. Democratic strategists  feel John Kerry's war record means he can beat Bush. They  say when it comes down to it voters will always vote for a  war hero over someone who tried to get out of the war. I'll  be sure to mention that to Bob Dole when I see him."  - Jay Leno   "They had a profile of John Kerry on the news and they said  his FIRST WIFE was worth around $300 million and his SECOND  WIFE, his current wife, is worth around $700 million. His  intern (with whom he supposedly had an affair) was worth  several more million. So when John Kerry says he's going  after the wealthy in this country, he's not just talking.  He's doing it!" - Jay Leno   "In his big victory speech last night, Senator Kerry said  that he wanted to defeat George Bush and the 'economy of  privilege.' Then he hugged his wife, Teresa, heir to the  multi-million dollar Heinz food fortune." - Jay Leno!   "A new poll shows that Senator Kerry's support in the South  is strongest amongst blacks. Kerry's appeal to Southern  blacks is obvious. He is an ultra-liberal, ultra-wealthy  white man who lives far, far away." - Dennis Miller   "In his speech last night, John Kerry said this was the  beginning of the end of the Bush administration. I agree.  Sure, it will probably take another five years, but this is  it." - Jay Leno

      Tonight, I feel old. I spent the day dealing with some shit that I would just as soon not, and then upon my return home from hastings, I got a dose of "oh my god im a geezer."  Some would say 25 isn't that old, but it is. I realized for the first time really today that in 5 years, I am going to be a 30 year old man. This is not mid life or anything obviously, but fuck! My mind has always been in a young place, and this disturbs me greatly.  I rented 2 movies and upon arriving home, there is a swarm of 19-20 year old beings, all as noisy as fucking possible, cavaliering around my once quiet neighborhood. It was actually annoying to me, and I muttered to myself "knocked up or locked up by the age of 23" which, I was taken aback at myself for thinking such a thing. I am not that much older, but for some reason that kinda thing just doesn't suit me, meaning that kinda hanging out and being, I dunno, useless in the twilight of an evening that could be spent reading, sailing, or something that MEANS something. I have no idea. It just fucked with me and still I am curious, when did I become old mr. mc-fuckins?  jesus jizzy christ I need a vicodin...

      I am spending a great deal of time at 3:28 a.m. just thinking. I do this alot late at night, when I am awake most.  I am thinking about my friend up in Washington State, and her stressful life situation dealing with work, and how it seems to be degrading her in both mind and heart. I worry for her, and her peace of mind. I hope she recovers and is in a position to heal soon.  I am thinking about my best friend back home, who is no doubt asleep at this insane hour, or if not, headed there soon enough. I am recalling all the adventures he and I have shared over the course of our long friendship, and smile at the reflection that alot of who I am today is a result of the many things he has taught me about loyalty, creativity, and exploration of the world in which I live and breathe. I am thinking about how he always seems to remain vital in the world, no matter what discouragements or trials befall him. I think about how, when I was at my lowest point in my life, and when I was not a free citizen due to mental illness, he was the only non-family human being who came to see me, and it was on his own initiative. That, is a true friend.  I am thinking about my friend I met back in Nacogdoches, whom has since moved back to his family's area. I think about the political education he has given me, and his shining sense of humor which can turn any major catastropy in my life into a SNL skit. I think about all he has endured before and SINCE he and I met, and realize that like the friend I mentioned prior, he is a true-blue lifelong friend, and also has always been there to lend his support and wisdom. I think about our mutual interest in gaming on the pc, and how that small gap was bridged and led to so much more a fulfilling thing than just mutual interests.  I am thinking about the online communities for which I am a part of, and all the multitude of minds that go along with that. I am thinking about how they share so much depth and personal clarity for me, and how I have learned to be open minded, steadfast in my arguments, and open to criticism. I am thinking about how, at the end of the fucking day, no matter where these people are, or who they are being, we are all in this life together, friend and foe alike, and in the final say on things, I belong.  I am also thinking about the creative talents for which I seem to have been afforded at birth. I truly believe in my deepest parts of me that were it not for these creative outlets, I would have ended my own life, long ago. I have this insatiable need to create ideas, and express myself. I cannot explain, nor fathom this truly well enough for my own tastes, but I recognise this as a vital part of the essence of my being, and know that, no matter how bad life may sometimes become for me, I can always find some way to weather the storms, as long as I can create something that, although remains outside of my actual being, is as much a part of me as the dead skin cells I shed daily.  In final commentary on this thought-stream, I am thinking about heroes. What I mean is that I am thinking about heroes of the world in which I live. I am not talking about cops, soliders, nuns, or doctors, no, not those kinds of people. Rather, I am referring to people who, like I wish to, will never give up what they believe in, nor what they demand to posess in this life, no matter the obstacles, such as disease, persectution, ignorance, or stereotypes which may come along in their daily lives. I am talking about the poets, the artists, the musicians, the political dissidents, and the hackers of the world. Not computer hackers so much as those who just hack, which is an umbrella statement to be truthful. I salute all those who may be awake at this ungodly hour of the morning, who read this and can relate, or at least understand that, were you me, you would be respecting those who are around you.  Sometimes, I think too much. Writing like this gets it out. Anything less than this would be my doom...

      I recently stumbled across the website for a game sequal that I used to really wanna play. Blood II: The Chosen was never really a big success in my orbit, and I only heard about it AFTER it disappeared off the store shelves, but I have played it since, and I have enjoyed the website immensely. It appears they have not updated their site since late 1999, but it still is neat to visit from time to time. I put a link-button on the main page of the site for people who might not have heard of the game, and the developers are offering the source code for free download as of now, and the demo can be downloaded as well. Anyone who likes dark humor and killing-spree entertainment, woohoo then :P

      The new graphic on the main part of my site, next to the menu has been stirring up...issues with some of my visitors. I got the graphic from an acquaintence of mine, who has this image on their web site as a border image, and I liked it. So I am using it on my site. No, it is NOT a drawing of me, or what I look like people, I am not a chick, nor an unholy demon one at that, heh. If you do not like the image then don't come back to the site, ask me to alter it in a NICE, MATURE manner, or go eat goat nads. I don't have time for the juvenile B.S.  On another note, fuck you :)

      I just got the new Dell machine setup and running on the LAN. I am eager to get to gaming and get some serious studio work done, and stop messing around with PM crap. I want to CREATE shit now, and enjoy gaming, and stop all the drama bullshit that I somehow keep allowing myself to be sucked into ad nauseam.

      I have been working on a new song release, which should be pretty neat. I made a mega-party type thing, which is over 30 mins long, featuring music from my retinue of tunes, and also all-new material. The megaparty mix, called "Texas Mythologies Volume One" will be appearing on the Red Skull music page soon.  Other than that, I have been playing "Hordes of the Underdark" expansion, and just trying to relax and enjoy life. My updating schedule on the site was rather obsessive the past few days, and I will now settle down into a happy modicum of mediation...

          The headline says it all: “conspiracy theories run amok as ‘Idol’ fever grips the country.” The story, describing the righteous explanation millions of angry Americans gave over the recent results of a reality TV show, hit Google News’ front page on Monday. Compared with this tale of such obviously towering importance, Iraq is just a blip on the radar screen.  The War Party in Washington is lucky that the American people, as obese mentally as they are physically, are interested only in stuffing their minds with reality TV, pop music and sporting scandals while they stuff their mouths with ice cream on the couch. With brains forever clogged and mouths invariably closed, political scheming becomes far easier. No longer are secret machinations required in order for the powers-that-be to get away with it.  The tested mental agility of the American people being what it is, it’s no surprise that an alleged conspiracy in ‘American Idol’ is given far greater credence than the possibility of a real conspiracy regarding the Iraq war. And as for the latter, the only one that still holds- incredibly enough- is the administration’s whopper that Saddam and Osama were surreptitiously collaborating on a plot to bring down the empire of the Good.  Yet by any definition, the preparation for the Iraq War was a conspiracy. A small group of mostly unknown men, operating from clandestine quarters deep in the bowels of the Pentagon, systematically manufactured lies and fraudulent “intelligence” in order to start a war against a non-threatening country. They referred to themselves, only half-jokingly, as “the Cabal.” In their all-encompassing desire to make war on Iraq, they both included sympathetic high-ranking officials (Dubya, Darth Cheney) and froze out other ones who were in opposition (Colin Powell, Dick Armitage).  What are the implications of this, the War Party’s profound banality? First of all, it both denigrates conspiracy theorizing as a much more commonplace and much less creative pastime than it’s usually perceived as being. None of the mental gymnastics that typically make conspiracy theorists so oddly endearing prove necessary in investigating Iraq. Unlike more famous conspiracy theories such as UFO’s in Roswell, the whereabouts of Elvis, or ‘who shot JFK?’, there was nothing particularly mysterious about this one. And neither was there forwarded any grandiose, all-encompassing project such as could acquire cinematic dimensions or require hidden, ultimate perpetrators such as space aliens or lizards from the fourth dimension. As conspiracies go, the Iraq one was a bit of a letdown.  When Vice President Cheney mocked his nemesis Colin Powell for being “out of the loop” over Iraq, it not only fueled indignant questions of why such disunity could be allowed to happen- it also reaffirmed that Cheney was part of the conspiracy the existence of which he had tried to deny.  In contrast to previous insider criticisms made by Paul O’Neill and Richard Clarke, George W. Bush apparently likes Bob Woodward’s book- because it upholds the idea that W. wears the daddy pants in the Administration. The implied charges may be equally damning, but at least the president is portrayed as a strong leader. Yet this has serious implications when it comes to the Sept. 11th investigations.  Since the introduction of the Orwellian Patriot Act, the status quo in America has been: “let us ask you a few questions, comrade; after all, you have nothing to hide, do you?” Yet now this conception has been stood on its head- as it rightly should be. Now, the same question is being asked of the government. If there was nothing to be covered up, then surely the powers that be will be glad to offer as much information as possible- right?  Silencing Whistleblowers  Yet the opposite has been the case. The Bush Administration has gone to great lengths to silence, to stonewall, to forever defer nagging public questions. And this behavior has seemed remarkably odd, even sinister. Indeed, if the government has nothing to hide, then why not let the whistleblowers be heard?  Foremost among the many worthy examples is the case of the heroic Sibel Edmonds, who has vocally maintained the existence of a Turkish spy ring in the highest levels of the FBI, one which unsuccessfully tried to recruit her. She’s also persistently repeated the idea that law enforcement had received many prior warnings about the likelihood of a terrorist attack. Yet deep embarrassment and fear of the potential political fallout has caused American leaders to try and stifle her. On Monday, Britain’s Independent wrote that  “…the US Justice Department is seeking to stop her from testifying, citing the rarely used ‘state secrets privilege.’ Today in a federal court in Washington, senior government lawyers will try to gag Mrs. Edmonds, claiming that disclosure of her evidence ‘would cause serious damage to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.’”  Whether or not the government’s contention is true, it seems clear that the former employee has some very interesting insights on why things went so wrong. According to Edmonds’ lawyer, Mark Zaid, “…the FBI wants to shut her up completely,” in order to save itself from embarrassment.  Yet Edmonds herself hit the nail on the head when she said:  “…what are they are afraid of? If I am not allowed to give evidence, the families will not get the information I have; that will be that… if there is transparency, there is going to be accountability and that is what they don't want.”  Archival Indiscretions  A perfect example of this allergy to accountability would seem to be George W. Bush’s new appointment as head of the National Archive, Allan Weinstein. As author John W. Dean charges,  “…the Weinstein nomination has rightly been gathering increasing attention. Indeed, within the archival and historical communities, the nomination has sent sirens screaming and bells clanging. No fewer than nine professional organizations that deal with government records have expressed concern -- faulting Weinstein for his excessive secrecy.”  Another source charges that Weinstein’s “…published historical works have been severely criticized on scholarship grounds”:  “…the criticism centers on his secrecy in not allowing others to view the records he relied upon for his two major works, ‘Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case’ and ‘The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America — The Stalin Era,’ which he co-authored.”  Any doubts regarding the would-be archivist’s agenda are thoroughly dispelled when we learn that:  “…Weinstein fell into favor with conservative Republican circles through his work on Alger Hiss. His work, ‘Perjury: the Hiss-Chambers Case’ (1978, rev. 1998) drew much criticism for the research methods he used. Weinstein's conclusion that Hiss was a Soviet spy drew the wrath of many, but made him a darling to the conservative that helped finance his various projects since.”  The problem goes beyond one man’s idiosyncrasies, however. The Weinstein nomination follows a clear pattern of behavior from Bush- whom Dean dubs “the most secretive president this nation has ever had.” While governor, Bush moved to “…block any later access to his gubernatorial records,” a difficult feat considering that Texas has one of America's strongest public information laws. Bush achieved his aim in 1997- by changing Texan law. And when Bush was elected president, recounts Dean,  “…he simply sent his papers and records with no consultation whatsoever to his father's presidential library at Texas A&M University -- known as the most secretive of all the existing presidential libraries. The result was, in effect, to federalize the papers and records, placing them in a legal limbo where no one could have access. Bush Senior's presidential library is run by the Federal Government -- specifically, the National Archives And Records Administration (NARA).”  While Director and Librarian of the Texas State Library and Archives Commission Peggy Rudd opposed Bush's ploy, the new president’s friend and hand-picked successor, Gov. Perry, “…found new exceptions in the state's information law that they claim give them the keys to the relevant filing cabinets. Good luck to those seeking access. Now it appears Bush is doing what he did in Texas, on a national level”:  “…this effort began on November 1, 2001, when Bush issued Executive Order 13233. The Executive Order drew loud objections from not only historians and archivists, but also members of Congress -- who were highly critical of the Order in hearings. In the end, however, the Republican leaders quelled the grumbling, and Congress took no action.”  We also learn that Bush’s Executive Order 13233 of Nov. 1, 2001 “gutted” federal guarantees of public accountability by reversing the 1978 Presidential Records Act. Bush’s Order  “…granted all former presidents, as well as any persons selected by them, an unprecedented authority to invoke executive privilege to block release of their records. In addition, it granted the power to invoke executive privilege to present and former vice-presidents as well. Moreover, it shifts the burden to the requester to establish why he or she seeks the presidential records. (In contrast, the 1978 law properly put the burden on the former president who seeks to withhold them.) And Bush's Order empowers a current president to block release of a former president's records even when the former president wishes to release them. Finally, it makes the Department of Justice available to represent, in litigation, any incumbent or former president seeking to withhold information.”  Members of the Society of American Archivists and other professional historians’ societies are afraid that Weinstein’s history of partisan and unprofessional scholarship, combined with the Bush Administration’s obsession with secrecy, will compromise the workings of this vital source of public information:  “…in nominating Weinstein, this Bush administration seeks an archivist who will be obedient to its every wish, including possibly withholding the release of presidential records and other information regarding the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  This action represents the administration's campaign to keep as much information from the public as possible. Such a preoccupation with information control only fuels suspicions that Americans would be very unhappy if they knew what White House officials were up to.”  In other words, the article warns, the administration risks abetting conspiracy theorists by its own reticence. Since the National Archive will be taking in more than 2.5 million pages of documents and transcripts from more than 1,000 interviews conducted by the 9/11 commission in September, and since the records from the George H.W. Bush administration are due for unveiling come January, it’s obvious why Bush Junior is pushing for a friendly man in the archive.  Yet it also stands to reason that if the subject of 9/11 is deemed so gravely important that a bipartisan panel is required to investigate it, than shouldn’t a bipartisan panel also be required to choose a head archivist? After all, what will be the point of the commission’s great labors if the results are sealed for reasons of alleged “national security?” The 9/11 Commission has gone to great lengths to collect all the relevant data- but what will it matter for the American people if this data is immediately thereafter sequestered by a partisan archivist?  In the end, such secrecy is unhealthy for the public because it actually promotes the cause of conspiracy theorists. By showing such repressive zeal in its continual blocking of public information, the Bush Administration itself generates suspicions. It is as if the administration is now asking itself if it’s still beating its wife.  Government, Media and Conspiracy  At first, this would seem like an unqualified disaster for the government. Yet on second consideration, we see that it’s entirely in their interests. Better than to deny or to patiently explain is simply to exacerbate that droning excess of white noise- too much information- that plagues America in particular and the globalized world in general.  The modern world’s best antithesis to government secrecy is obviously the internet. But this is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the internet allows for the free and immediate flow of information, pure, unfiltered and oftentimes transferred before it can be doctored by government apologists. Yet on the other hand, the sheer size of the internet and its disturbed variety mean that the lucid and the ludicrous emerge simultaneously and everywhere.  Forget about the continual, tiresome complaints of rival groups- about the alleged dominance of the “liberal media,” or the perceived chokehold of the “conservative media.” The truly dominant entity- when we add television, radio and the print media into the mix- is the media itself, constantly replicating, enlarging, disseminating and otherwise contradicting, embellishing and castigating its own existence and production. It has neither a single master nor message. Far from winning by harnessing a certain message or mantra to be repeated, the government claims victory precisely by playing into this cacophony and encouraging the continual generation of diverging and dissonant viewpoints- the more extreme the better.  Thus the media plays two key roles for government: exacerbating the average guy’s inability to keep up with events through sensory overload, and also justifying its own (real) indiscretions by comparing any criticism of them to the most far-fetched of the conspiracy theories. The former gives the powers-that-be an easy escape from scrutiny (‘just keep creating new information, more white noise’) while the latter provides government with a handy tool for smearing every real, well-supported indictment of their behavior (‘come on, that’s just a conspiracy theory’). Thus in one fell swoop is eliminated all objection- the intelligent along with the idiotic, the juvenile with the justified.  This is why, in the end, the biggest government conspiracy of all may well be the facilitating of conspiracy theories, accomplished accidentally, simply by being secretive to the extreme. Human curiosity increases in direct proportion to attempts to withhold information. By the same measure, creative explanations for governmental mishaps seem to generate ex nihilo and flourish the more that they are deprived of any informative sustenance.  When it comes to 9/11, despite all the intriguing discrepancies- like why the planes weren’t scrambled, or Bush’s movements in Florida while reading stories about goats- it seems most likely that top officials were merely asleep at the wheel before the attacks, and exhibited confusion during and after them. This is embarrassing stuff indeed- and if approached from that point of view, can and should have fatal repercussions for the careers of many high officials. Yet if Bush wins his battle in the trenches of the National Archive, secrecy will not only prevail regarding this key issue- it will also ensure the continued propagation of more outlandish theories that will easily be laughed off. Which is a victory in its own right for the powers-that-be. ----------------------------------------------------------- "Tuesday 27 April 2004       Washington (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday it would not allow any recordings or transcripts of private testimony this week by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to the panel investigating the Sept. 11 attacks.       Rebuffing demands from families of some of the nearly 3,000 dead and other critics of the administration for public testimony, Bush and Cheney only agreed to Thursday's unprecedented interview under pressure and on the grounds they would appear together and behind closed doors.       At the administration's request, the session will not be recorded and an official transcript will not be made. The White House said Bush was already providing unprecedented access to the panel and that the decision was consistent with previous private interviews.       "This is a private interview and it's being treated that way," said commission spokesman Al Felzenberg.       Both sides said they will have note-takers present.       In preparation for Thursday's session, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush was reviewing documents and meeting with his top advisers.       He said Bush does not plan to make an opening statement and is likely to personally field most of the questions -- rather than Cheney. They will not be under oath. " --------------------------------------------------------------- So then, what is the motherfucking POINT here??? Not under oath, not allowed to be filmed or taped, what the fuck does this prove or disprove? God dammit this shit makes me angry...

      A mother and her son were flying Southwest Airlines from Kansas City to Chicago.   The son (who had been looking out the window) turned to his mother and asked, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"   The mother (who couldn't think of an answer) told her son to ask the stewardess.   So the boy asked the stewardess, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?"   The stewardess responded, "Did your mother tell you to ask me?"   The boy said, "Yes she did."   "Well, then, tell your mother that there are no baby planes because Southwest always pulls out on time.  Have your mother explain that to you."

      I am a passionate motherfucker. If you sit and read into this blog on any level of depth, you will find those aforementioned passions laid bare like a whore on Ash Wednesday. True, you will also find laid bare, my increasing disatisfaction with society in general. Bitterness? Disillusionment? Rebelliousness and frivolity on a scale unmatched in my generation? No. Bitterness, yes. Disillusionment, you bet your hairy ass. Rebelliousness, fuckin' a. Frivolity, only to morons who are not me. This means you.  I take myself serious. Perhaps too serious for some to sit still and take it like a man, but they are not the important issue. I am dissilusioned. I am disheartened by the things I see and hear on a daily basis. People have to get to walmart at the SPEED OF FUCKING SOUND, because, for some unfathomable reason, it may be GONE before they get there, so they feel the need to drive like maniacs. I am disheartened by the legal system for which THERE IS NO SOLID FORM. People who should be put into a sweat box and fed nails are set loose to prey upon kids, and those who are actually good people are being put into the cells and being raped,accused etc. Am I a doomsayer? Is this the end of the fucking world?  Of course not. I am not that far gone. What I do feel and believe however, is that the world in which I live has less and less need for one such as I. One such as I who, when faced with something like the 9/11 American drama, does not believe what is fed to me. One such as I who, when told that the medical industry is designed to help me, feels like strangling the director(s) of the CDC and the medication brokers of the world.  I do not believe in conspiracies. I do not believe in secret cabals and cults from ancient times, forthing at the forefront of the world around me. I do however, believe in evil.  How does one define evil?  evil:   Morally bad or wrong; wicked: an evil tyrant.  Causing ruin, injury, or pain; harmful: the evil effects of a poor diet.  Characterized by or indicating future misfortune; ominous: evil omens.  Bad or blameworthy by report; infamous: an evil reputation.  Characterized by anger or spite; malicious: an evil temper.   To me, there are gradients of evil. I feel the greatest and single most destructive evil known to the world is this: People who do what they feel is right, no matter what the cost. I think the most evil fucking beings on the  rock are those who do what they feel is right, at the expense of everyone and everything. In other words: denial....  Yes, I am disheartened. Many who read this would assume I have lost my mind. No, I just realize more everyday how fucked up the world is. It is easier to deny it and go about your day, assuming its someone else who gets affected by human evil caused by stupidity. It is easier to deny how very fragile your life and home and family is. The joke is sick, and joke is on us all....

Nothing else matters but the creative process for me right now.  I am also putting my musical works on hold for the short-term, as my passion for poetry writing has all but consumed me. I cannot stop writing and it has really boosted my morale and my emotional well being overall, and I feel that at this time, I should focus on that.

      Q:  Daddy, why did we have to attack Iraq?  A:  Because they had weapons of mass destruction.  Q:  But the inspectors didn't find any weapons of mass destruction.  A:  That's because the Iraqis were hiding them.  Q:  And that's why we invaded Iraq?  A:  Yep. Invasions always work better than inspections.  Q:  But after we invaded them, we STILL didn't find any weapons of mass destruction, did we?  A:  That's because the weapons are so well hidden. Don't worry, we'll find something, probably right before the 2004 election.  Q:  Why did Iraq want all those weapons of mass destruction?  A:  To use them in a war, silly.  Q:  I'm confused. If they had all those weapons that they planned to use in a war, then why didn't they use any of those weapons when we went to war with them?  A:  Well, obviously they didn't want anyone to know they had those weapons, so they chose to die by the thousands rather than defend themselves.  Q:  That doesn't make sense. Why would they choose to die if they had all those big weapons with which they could have fought back?  A:  It's a different culture. It's not supposed to make sense.  Q:  I don't know about you, but I don't think they had any of those weapons our government said they did.  A:  Well, you know, it doesn't matter whether or not they had those weapons. We had another good reason to invade them anyway.  Q:  And what was that?  A:  Even if Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was a cruel dictator, which is another good reason to invade another country.  Q:  Why? What does a cruel dictator do that makes it OK to invade his country?  A:  Well, for one thing, he tortured his own people.  Q:  Kind of like what they do in China?  A:  Don't go comparing China to Iraq. China is a good economic competitor, where millions of people work for slave wages in sweatshops to make U.S. corporations richer.  Q:  So if a country lets its people be exploited for American corporate gain, it's a good country, even if that country tortures people?  A:  Right.  Q:  Why were people in Iraq being tortured?  A:  For political crimes, mostly, like criticizing the government. People who criticized the government in Iraq were sent to prison and tortured.  Q:  Isn't that exactly what happens in China?  A:  I told you, China is different.  Q:  What's the difference between China and Iraq?  A:  Well, for one thing, Iraq was ruled by the Ba'ath party, while China is Communist.  Q:  Didn't you once tell me Communists were bad?  A:  No, just Cuban Communists are bad.  Q:  How are the Cuban Communists bad?  A:  Well, for one thing, people who criticize the government in Cuba are sent to prison and tortured.  Q:  Like in Iraq?  A:  Exactly.  Q:  And like in China, too?  A:  I told you, China's a good economic competitor. Cuba, on the other hand, is not.  Q:  How come Cuba isn't a good economic competitor?  A:  Well, you see, back in the early 1960s, our government passed some laws that made it illegal for Americans to trade or do any business with Cuba until they stopped being Communists and started being capitalists like us.  Q:  But if we got rid of those laws, opened up trade with Cuba, and started doing business with them, wouldn't that help the Cubans become capitalists?  A:  Don't be a smart-ass.  Q:  I didn't think I was being one.  A:  Well, anyway, they also don't have freedom of religion in Cuba.  Q:  Kind of like China and the Falun Gong movement?  A:  I told you, stop saying bad things about China. Anyway, Saddam Hussein came to power through a military coup, so he's not really a legitimate leader anyway.  Q:  What's a military coup?  A:  That's when a military general takes over the government of a country by force, instead of holding free elections like we do in the United States.  Q:  Didn't the ruler of Pakistan come to power by a military coup?  A:  You mean General Pervez Musharraf? Uh, yeah, he did, but Pakistan is our friend.  Q:  Why is Pakistan our friend if their leader is illegitimate?  A:  I never said Pervez Musharraf was illegitimate.  Q:  Didn't you just say a military general who comes to power by forcibly overthrowing the legitimate government of a nation is an illegitimate leader?  A:  Only Saddam Hussein. Pervez Musharraf is our friend, because he helped us invade Afghanistan.  Q:  Why did we invade Afghanistan?  A:  Because of what they did to us on September 11th.  Q:  What did Afghanistan do to us on September 11th?  A:  Well, on September 11th, nineteen men - fifteen of them Saudi Arabians - hijacked four airplanes and flew three of them into buildings in New York and Washington, killing 3,000 innocent people.  Q:  So how did Afghanistan figure into all that?  A:  Afghanistan was where those bad men trained, under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.  Q:  Aren't the Taliban those bad radical Islamics who chopped off people's heads and hands?  A:  Yes, that's exactly who they were. Not only did they chop off people's heads and hands, but they oppressed women, too.  Q:  Didn't the Bush administration give the Taliban 43 million dollars back in May of 2001?  A:  Yes, but that money was a reward because they did such a good job fighting drugs.  Q:  Fighting drugs?  A:  Yes, the Taliban were very helpful in stopping people from growing opium poppies.  Q:  How did they do such a good job?  A:  Simple. If people were caught growing opium poppies, the Taliban would have their hands and heads cut off.  Q:  So, when the Taliban cut off people's heads and hands for growing flowers, that was OK, but not if they cut people's heads and hands off for other reasons?  A:  Yes. It's OK with us if radical Islamic fundamentalists cut off people's hands for growing flowers, but it's cruel if they cut off people's hands for stealing bread.  Q:  Don't they also cut off people's hands and heads in Saudi Arabia?  A:  That's different. Afghanistan was ruled by a tyrannical patriarchy that oppressed women and forced them to wear burqas whenever they were in public, with death by stoning as the penalty for women who did not comply.  Q:  Don't Saudi women have to wear burqas in public, too?  A:  No, Saudi women merely wear a traditional Islamic body covering.  Q:  What's the difference?  A:  The traditional Islamic covering worn by Saudi women is a modest yet fashionable garment that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and fingers. The burqa, on the other hand, is an evil tool of patriarchal oppression that covers all of a woman's body except for her eyes and fingers.  Q:  It sounds like the same thing with a different name.  A:  Now, don't go comparing Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. The Saudis are our friends.  Q:  But I thought you said 15 of the 19 hijackers on September 11th were from Saudi Arabia.  A:  Yes, but they trained in Afghanistan.  Q:  Who trained them?  A:  A very bad man named Osama bin Laden.  Q:  Was he from Afghanistan?  A:  Uh, no, he was from Saudi Arabia too. But he was a bad man, a very bad man.  Q:  I seem to recall he was our friend once.  A:  Only when we helped him and the mujahadeen repel the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan back in the 1980s.  Q:  Who are the Soviets? Was that the Evil Communist Empire Ronald Reagan talked about?  A:  There are no more Soviets. The Soviet Union broke up in 1990 or thereabouts, and now they have elections and capitalism like us. We call them Russians now.  Q:  So the Soviets - I mean, the Russians - are now our friends?  A:  Well, not really. You see, they were our friends for many years after they stopped being Soviets, but then they decided not to support our invasion of Iraq, so we're mad at them now. We're also mad at the French and the Germans because they didn't help us invade Iraq either.  Q:  So the French and Germans are evil, too?  A:  Not exactly evil, but just bad enough that we had to rename French fries and French toast to Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.  Q:  Do we always rename foods whenever another country doesn't do what we want them to do?  A:  No, we just do that to our friends. Our enemies, we invade.  Q:  But wasn't Iraq one of our friends back in the 1980s?  A:  Well, yeah. For a while.  Q:  Was Saddam Hussein ruler of Iraq back then?  A:  Yes, but at the time he was fighting against Iran, which made him our friend, temporarily.  Q:  Why did that make him our friend?  A:  Because at that time, Iran was our enemy.  Q:  Isn't that when he gassed the Kurds?  A:  Yeah, but since he was fighting against Iran at the time, we looked the other way, to show him we were his friend.  Q:  So anyone who fights against one of our enemies automatically becomes our friend?  A:  Most of the time, yes.  Q:  And anyone who fights against one of our friends is automatically an enemy?  A:  Sometimes that's true, too. However, if American corporations can profit by selling weapons to both sides at the same time, all the better.  Q:  Why?  A:  Because war is good for the economy, which means war is good for America. Also, since God is on America's side, anyone who opposes war is a godless unAmerican Communist. Do you understand now why we attacked Iraq?  Q:  I think so. We attacked them because God wanted us to, right?  A:  Yes.  Q:  But how did we know God wanted us to attack Iraq?  A:  Well, you see, God personally speaks to George W. Bush and tells him what to do.  Q:  So basically, what you're saying is that we attacked Iraq because George W. Bush hears voices in his head?  A:  Yes! You finally understand how the world works. Now close your eyes, make yourself comfortable, and go to sleep. Good night.  Q:  Good night, Daddy.

      "When the Pizza Man Turns Evil (and stupid)"     It happens occasionally. I order something from pizza hut like a pizone or use one of those coupons (which I don't really possess but they don't fucking know that). I give them all the relevant data (it seems they ask for more each time). I am pretty sure the standard for Pizza Hut is 45 mins or less, depending on your region and the store you are dealing with correct? Anyway, I ordered a pizza and a 2-liter of soda at 9:45 p.m....  At 11:15 p.m. I decided to call the goddamn commie bastards and find out if my pizza had somehow been beamed to the planet Arcturis instead of DOWN THE FUCKING STREET where it belonged....I got a 'tude'. What the FUCK? They got pissed off at me for bothering them about my centuries old order?!!??! OOOH!  When the pizza man finally came, he was seemingly angry at the world. Since I used to deliver pizza's for this same company, I can understand the stress the poor bastard goes through, such as people not having money when he gets to an address. Something once happened to me, where the guy I delivered to had 10 one-hundred dollar bills for an order costing 8.57 and he wanted change!  Yet this guy was a little different. He said something in a hushed tone, and when I said "do what?" he said "never fucking mind". Then he drove off as if the mafia were about to take him swimming (heh). What made me freakin pissed wasn't his attitude, it was the fact that in his moronic zeal to gtf out of dodge, he left me the pizza but didn't TAKE THE GODDAMN CHECK. This meant that, after I had eaten, laid down for my nights sleep, and forgot all about Pizza BUTT, the fuckers called me, by way of the store director, at 2 o-clock in the goddamn morning demanding I come down there to pay for my pizza, or they wouldn't deliver to me again. This entire scenario is real and happened because the now evil as fuck pizza man told them I grabbed the pizza and refused to pay him. Um, I think, had I done something illegal, assaultive and really stupid, not only would the police have been involved, but this guy, who outweighs me 3 to one, would have kicked my ass to canada and back again.  The moral? Pizza hut is a really cool American Institution. They have great food if not always great prices. They just have alot of pizza delivery people who need their enema adjusted, their heads chopped off and fed to 3rd world villagers, and a removal of their UNCANNY sense of "denial". Fuck em...

      HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH  This is the funniest thing I have read about in AGES!!! AHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH ---------------------  MEXICO CITY, Mexico (AP) -- The Mexican underworld's taste for bizarre nicknames was on full display in February, when police in Mexico City filed kidnap and murder charges against a gang whose aliases sounded something out of Snow White.  There was "El Salivotas" (the Drooler); "El Guero" (Blondie); "El Enano" (the Dwarf); "El Duende" (the Elf); "El Cejas" (Eyebrows); and "El Tamalon" (the Big Tamale).  The lone female member was legally named Dulce Maria, or Sweet Maria.  Ordinary Mexicans use nicknames a lot. "Gordo," for instance, means "Fatty" and is considered a term of endearment. But criminal aliases that turn up in charge sheets can be so bizarre that even Mexicans are lost for explanations.  "Winnie the Pooh" was Oscar Guerrero Silva, a triggerman for Mexico's drug cartels. Hardly a lovable bear, he belonged to a gang of Mexican army deserters who worked for the drug lords. His specialty -- before dying of a gunshot wound to the head in February in an apparent suicide -- was busting drug suspects out of jail at gunpoint.  How about "El Cachorro" (The Puppy)? That Mexico City mechanic allegedly specialized in kidnapping and abusing young women.  One mainly male gang of northern Mexican hoodlums named themselves "Las Carmelitas" -- roughly the Carmelite Sisters -- after their female leader, Carmela.  Many suspect that cops and crime reporters encourage, embellish and even invent some of the stranger nicknames.  Presented with police reports that often list up to a half-dozen aliases for one suspect, the media and the public usually focus on the most outrageous one.  "If you want to get a crime story on the front page, you've got to have an impressive nickname, and if the suspect doesn't have one, you've got to look for one," says Paco Ignacio Taibo II, who writes detective novels.  Some gangs were almost certainly "dubbed" that way by the public, press and police, like the two most famous kidnapping gangs of the 1990s: "The Ear Loppers" and "The Finger Cutters," who did exactly that to their victims.  Journalists deny inventing nicknames, saying those bubble up spontaneously out of Mexico's violent, socially frayed neighborhoods.  "People in some of these neighborhoods are known more by their nicknames than their real names," says Celeste Saenz, the general secretary of Mexico's Press Club. "The nicknames give them some status, some sense of belonging to a group."  People in some of these neighborhoods are known more by their nicknames than their real names. The nicknames give them some status, some sense of belonging to a group. -- Celeste Saenz, Mexico's Press Club      Federal prosecutors acknowledge they collect as many nicknames as possible on crime reports, but only so they can fully identify and locate suspects who might use several tags.  But lawyer Americo Delgado, who has defended some of Mexico's highest-profile drug suspects, claims police sometimes try to slap labels on his clients -- "The Lord of Methamphetamines," for instance -- to make them appear guilty.  According to Taibo, the public's fascination with criminal nicknames goes back at least to the 1920s, when hoodlums with monikers like "The Black Cap" roamed Mexico City. But back then, even the worst bandits were known by fairly innocuous monikers like "The Gray Car Gang."  By the 1980s, the drug wars and an influx of cultural imports -- everything from U.S. movies to Kung-Fu videos -- gave birth to a strange new nomenclature, Saenz says.  Aliases became more high-flown and grisly, like "El Senor de los Cielos" (The Lord of the Skies) for a trafficker who flew planeloads of cocaine into the United States.  A beefy housewife who allegedly dominated the drug trade on Mexico City's rough east side had a gang calling itself "Ma Baker."  "I'm sure they saw a pirate copy of a U.S. movie about Ma Barker, and thought that would be a good nickname," Astorga says. "They just got the spelling wrong."  The same appears to apply to the diminutive armed robber known as "Chuky, the Diabolical Doll." Chuky is the Mexican spelling of Chucky, the murderous doll in the 1988 U.S. horror movie "Child's Play."

      I just got done dealing with someone about a death...then I was listening to the radio. A comment was made that has, for the last time, hit a nerve in me, and I am about to open up a can on the comment, its context, and the morons who say it. If you say it aloud or in conversation, this means FUCKIN YOU!  "We have to be respectful and remember the troops who are fighting for our freedom".  Look, you self-righteous, idiotic, dimwitted, DELUDED fool: OUR NATION's LIBERTY IS NOT AT STAKE HERE!  We are not under imminent threat of invasion! We are not in imminent danger of being nuked by a bunch of brown shitstains who cannot even overcome SANCTIONS against them from a United Nations that is about as useful as the word "curmudgeon" in everyday speech!  We are not in danger of losing our freedom!!! We are not in danger of losing our rights to pray, peepee, argue, shave our balls or any other right that we, as AMERICUNTS have!  What the fuck is wrong with the society I am a part of, when we justify a war in another country because "our civil and national sovereignty are being threatened by a hairy-faced sick-magnet who BY NO MEANS WHATSOEVER can, will, or COULD, pose a threat to us?!?!!?  Did he gas his own people? So fucking what! Did he kill his cousin? So fucking what! He didn't kill me, or mine, I don't fuckin care! People have always abused those under their rule. The shit happens here ALL THE FUCKING TIME. The only diff between our glorious leader of the "mind-free" world and So-Damn-Inane, is that So-Damn got caught. NUFF FUCKING SAID...  Support those that protect our freedom my ass. What about protect our freedm from the assfucks in charge over here, who are, quite literally, by the day, reducing freedom to a footnote in their manifesto during a meeting about the cost of toilet seats in the Presidential Vacation cottage at Camp David? What about the Manhattan Project and dues owed to those poor bastards it affected? What about Waco? What about the fact that everytime anyone, ANYONE has gone major public with something about our "glorious leader" that didn't jive, something happens to them, and soon?  Main point" How dare you tell me to support a war that is only being fought because the soliders fighting it will be put to death for treason for refusing to fight it. It has nothing to do with freedom, and everything to do with distraction. Wake up America, your farm is being subsectioned off....fuckers

      When someone dies, no matter the reasoning or cause of it, it makes people react in so many different ways, it is almost comedic to me.  For me, the deaths I have faced in my own short life has always affected me the same way: I greive later, in private. I rarely, if ever show emotion for those that have gone on, because to be quite frank about it all, sometimes my brain takes over my heart. People die. Crying about it only rubs in my pain, and they are still dead and turning to dust as I weep on my soon to be decayed hands. Fuck that. I have too much else to do and see and hear and tear apart and rebuild back up again to let it destroy me.  The hardest part of dealing with death, on my end of things, is those that are left behind, and those who are left behind THAT, and are forced to help comfort the uncomforting reality that, kids have no mother, etc. It really does a number on me when someone near me dies, and thei children of that person are left in a whirlwind of not understanding, and not being able to wrap their little minds around the tragic certainty that is death. Bah...

      Cyber church reacts to 'Satan' visit Wednesday, May 19, 2004 Posted: 8:12 PM EDT (0012 GMT)      LONDON, England (AP) -- Britain's first three-dimensional cyber church has been forced to tighten security after a slew of abusive visitors ranted from the pulpit and swore in the aisles.  The Church of Fools said Wednesday it has withdrawn the "shout" button, which allows visitors to address everyone who is present, and added more wardens, who use a "smite" button to log out people who use abusive language. The apse area, including pulpit, lectern and altar have also been closed to visitors.  The church said the first two days of the site, which launched last week, had been very noisy; in one case, a person logged in as Satan, entered the pulpit and started to blaspheme.  The church, complete with a stained glass window, gothic arches, pews, and a crypt, is sponsored by the Methodist Church and run by Ship of Fools, a campaigning online Christian magazine.  Church spokesman Stephen Goddard compared the difficulties with early problems faced by the evangelist John Wesley, who founded Methodism in the 18th century.  "When Wesley started off all those years ago preaching to the unconverted, he was shouted at, spat at and abused and people brayed like donkeys to put him off preaching," Goddard said.  "When you go out into a different culture first you are going to suffer abuse. We are not worried about it and it does not offend us."  Visitors to the church -- represented by three-dimensional figures, or avatars -- are able to cross themselves, kneel to pray and throw their hands up in worship.  Most worship is personal and contemplative -- visitors can talk among themselves -- but there are regular sermons by visiting preachers, delivered in audio and text formats. The first speaker was the Anglican Bishop of London, the Right Rev. Richard Chartres.  Wardens struggled to oversee 60,000 visits to the church during the first two days of opening; the site has attracted an average of between 5,000 and 10,000 visits a day since then.  Church of Fools said most of the problems happened during the night in Britain, when people log on from the United States and Australia.   HAHAHAHAHAHahahahahahaAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Truth be told, I logged in, emailed some mails, then emailed myself from a hotmail account to see how the ads would appear, and I had a hard time FINDING them. They were pale great at the very tale-end of my message, so I am not sensing it to be an issue. I really like the SPEED also, because hotmail seems to drag its nads across my patience.

      Where were you on September 11, 2000? What were you doing? I know where I was, and what I was doing: Reading a book, and, at the time, had not had cable in my home in over a year. My neighbor banged on my door to “enlighten me” about the horrible news item on his screen all damn day. I will never forget how those images “changed” me. For better or for worse has yet to be determined.  Things happen, with or without warning, as we live and breathe, things which change use for the rest of our days hence. It seems the only constant thing in life, it is said, is change. However, I wonder what it is, for each of you out there, not only myself, which changes you so profoundly, and for all future intents and purposes? What are the driving forces which make you rethink your life, and put into perspective what it means to be a human being.  Forty-Five and a half minutes ago, someone in my life died. I am changed. Not because of how and why they died, but because the unshakable was shaken. I am uncertain as to the nature of the change within me, but the maddening complexity of it is bothering me.

      I am an angry human being. I always have been an angry human being. People continue to complain to me about this aspect of myself. I am not listening, dumbasses!   Why?   I am not listening because to be quite honest, if I show no anger at half the fools I encounter in my life, they will never CEASE to disrupt my breathing cycle with their banality. I am not listening to people telling me to chill out when all they do is cause migraines, because, it is not up to them, or they, or you to tell me how I should deal with my issues or my emotions. You are not me. To be quite blunt and to the fucking point on this topic, most that offer me behavior-modification advice CAN NOT and WILL NOT follow it themselves!   I am constantly told in my daily life to calm down and not be so negative about things.  Clue for the strangers who assume based on limited foreknowledge: you do not know me, nor my circumstances, nor my past, my present nor my nightmares, dreams, shit-sessions, piss breaks, yelling matches with family. Quite simply, shut the fuck up, because you are a tool.  When someone tells me to "calm down", usually, the person is under my age, living in a 50-150 thousand dollar home, paid for by daddy's cocaine habit or momma's avon empire, and have no concept of WHY someone like myself would be so angry. Drop dead, upper-middle class HOT TOPIC prostitutes! You have no idea how full of it you are.  Therapists use buzz-words and catch-phrases for their patients, things like:   "Don't hold it in, let it out, it will make you explode if you hold it in"   Well, for someone of my background and temperament, if I hold it in, someone will DIE. I get out my anger on-the-*******-spot, and I never hold back what I think or feel, because there is too much all the time to attempt it. I tried once. I won't try that sheepish cow-down and accept it thing again.   I am an angry human being because people cannot or will not READ shit that is plainly posted in front of their non-computational eyes, and therefore their non-computational BRAINS. Read it, then absorb it. If this is so difficult for you, how in the name of God's nadsack are you able to login to an internet account/site account? It is because you CHOOSE to feign ignorance to get attention, or, quite unbelievably, you ARE that FUCKING stupid!  I am fed up to the point of igniting a church, regarding people arguing about shit on a pseudo-intellectual level about the most INANE shit imaginable! People sit on forums, and sit at DENNY's arguing about the most intellectually mundane SHIT to ever grace my ears. The reason this is so annoying is because they KNOW THAT IT MEANINGLESS!  I do not CARE about the war in Iraq, people. Can we clear that up right-fast? I DO NOT GIVE A SHITNIPPLE about those dune coons! Let them all have their screaming yelling suicide bomb fuck-fest, but leave me the fuck out of it. It is not going to end because the brass doesn't WANT it to end, so stop reminding me why I lost faith in my country, and go home and fuck a tree!  In closing, I am an angry human being. This is not going to change any time soon, or at least until my stroke. It is not about YOU, it is about me. deal with it shit-stick! If this post offends you, sue me.

      With this post, I have reached a cross-roads in my life. There is no going back for me, which is just how it should be...  After hearing about, and watching about, the American having his noggin cut off on video, and hearing all of the conflicting stories on both side about this issue, and the ongoing, nagging me to fucking insanity, arguments, ranting, and general chaos surrounding the war in Iraq, I have reached a state of total and completely staining political APATHY.  I no longer care who wins what. I no longer care who becomes president of the United Mockery of America. I no longer care about pro-life, medicinal pot, gay marriage, NOTHING political! From now on, if you have a view on something related to politics, keep it under your girdle, because I refuse to discuss it.  Will the Iraq nation be freed? Does it, in the larger picture of my life and times, really fucking matter? NO, kids, it has no relevance to my existence. Gas prices will rise any goddamn way because of Opec, and the other idiots who control it. So fuck it all. I do not give a fuck anymore, and I don't want to hear about it....

      The following document, dated May 1979, was found on July 7, 1986, in an IBM copier that had been purchased at a surplus sale.    TOP SECRET  Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars  Operations Research Technical Manual TM-SW7905.1  Welcome Aboard  This publication marks the 25th anniversary of the Third World War, called the "Quiet War", being conducted using subjective biological warfare, fought with "silent weapons."   This book contains an introductory description of this war, its strategies, and its weaponry.   May 1979 #74-1120    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Security  It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide.  This manual is in itself an analog declaration of intent. Such a writing must be secured from public scrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declaration of domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public, uses such knowledge and methodologies for economic conquest - it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public.   The solution of today's problems requires an approach which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious, moral or cultural values.   You have qualified for this project because of your ability to look at human society with cold objectivity, and yet analyze and discuss your observations and conclusions with others of similar intellectual capacity without the loss of discretion or humility. Such virtues are exercised in your own best interest. Do not deviate from them.    Historical Introduction  Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the Military Management in England during World War II. The original purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e., logistics).  It was soon recognized by those in positions of power that the same methods might be useful for totally controlling a society. But better tools were necessary.   Social engineering (the analysis and automation of a society) requires the correlation of great amounts of constantly changing economic information (data), so a high-speed computerized data-processing system was necessary which could race ahead of the society and predict when society would arrive for capitulation.   Relay computers were to slow, but the electronic computer, invented in 1946 by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, filled the bill.   The next breakthrough was the development of the simplex method of linear programming in 1947 by the mathematician George B. Dantzig.   Then in 1948, the transistor, invented by J. Bardeen, W.H. Brattain, and W. Shockley, promised great expansion of the computer field by reducing space and power requirements.   With these three inventions under their direction, those in positions of power strongly suspected that it was possible for them to control the whole world with the push of a button.   Immediately, the Rockefeller Foundation got in on the ground floor by making a four-year grant to Harvard College, funding the Harvard Economic Research Project for the study of the structure of the American Economy. One year later, in 1949, The United States Air Force joined in.   In 1952 the grant period terminated, and a high-level meeting of the Elite was held to determine the next phase of social operations research. The Harvard project had been very fruitful, as is borne out by the publication of some of its results in 1953 suggesting the feasibility of economic (social) engineering. (Studies in the Structure of the American Economy - copyright 1953 by Wassily Leontief, International Science Press Inc., White Plains, New York).   Engineered in the last half of the decade of the 1940's, the new Quiet War machine stood, so to speak, in sparkling gold-plated hardware on the showroom floor by 1954.   With the creation of the maser in 1954, the promise of unlocking unlimited sources of fusion atomic energy from the heavy hydrogen in sea water and the consequent availability of unlimited social power was a possibility only decades away.   The combination was irresistible.   The Quiet War was quietly declared by the International Elite at a meeting held in 1954.   Although the silent weapons system was nearly exposed 13 years later, the evolution of the new weapon-system has never suffered any major setbacks.   This volume marks the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the Quiet War. Already this domestic war has had many victories on many fronts throughout the world.   Political Introduction  In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power, for the very elements of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopia as they were for providing a private utopia.  The issue of primary concern, that of dominance, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences.   Energy  Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping.  All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary?   In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called "moral issues" were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent.   Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few.   In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public appearance as to earn for themselves the name "silent weapons."   In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the magnates of capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods) and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable.   In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the low-class elements of society must be brought under total control, i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social duties from a very early age, before they have an opportunity to question the propriety of the matter. In order to achieve such conformity, the lower-class family unit must be disintegrated by a process of increasing preoccupation of the parents and the establishment of government-operated day-care centers for the occupationally orphaned children.   The quality of education given to the lower class must be of the poorest sort, so that the moat of ignorance isolating the inferior class from the superior class is and remains incomprehensible to the inferior class. With such an initial handicap, even bright lower class individuals have little if any hope of extricating themselves from their assigned lot in life. This form of slavery is essential to maintain some measure of social order, peace, and tranquillity for the ruling upper class.   Descriptive Introduction of the Silent Weapon  Everything that is expected from an ordinary weapon is expected from a silent weapon by its creators, but only in its own manner of functioning.  It shoots situations, instead of bullets; propelled by data processing, instead of chemical reaction (explosion); originating from bits of data, instead of grains of gunpowder; from a computer, instead of a gun; operated by a computer programmer, instead of a marksman; under the orders of a banking magnate, instead of a military general.   It makes no obvious explosive noises, causes no obvious physical or mental injuries, and does not obviously interfere with anyone's daily social life.   Yet it makes an unmistakable "noise," causes unmistakable physical and mental damage, and unmistakably interferes with the daily social life, i.e., unmistakable to a trained observer, one who knows what to look for.   The public cannot comprehend this weapon, and therefore cannot believe that they are being attacked and subdued by a weapon.   The public might instinctively feel that something is wrong, but that is because of the technical nature of the silent weapon, they cannot express their feeling in a rational way, or handle the problem with intelligence. Therefore, they do not know how to cry for help, and do not know how to associate with others to defend themselves against it.   When a silent weapon is applied gradually, the public adjusts/adapts to its presence and learns to tolerate its encroachment on their lives until the pressure (psychological via economic) becomes too great and they crack up.   Therefore, the silent weapon is a type of biological warfare. It attacks the vitality, options, and mobility of the individuals of a society by knowing, understanding, manipulating, and attacking their sources of natural and social energy, and their physical, mental, and emotional strengths and weaknesses.   Theoretical Introduction  Give me control over a nation's currency, and I care not who makes its laws.  -- Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1743 - 1812)   Today's silent weapons technology is an outgrowth of a simple idea discovered, succinctly expressed, and effectively applied by the quoted Mr. Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild discovered the missing passive component of economic theory known as economic inductance. He, of course, did not think of his discovery in these 20th-century terms, and, to be sure, mathematical analysis had to wait for the Second Industrial Revolution, the rise of the theory of mechanics and electronics, and finally, the invention of the electronic computer before it could be effectively applied in the control of the world economy.  General Energy Concepts  In the study of energy systems, there always appears three elementary concepts. These are potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy dissipation. And corresponding to these concepts, there are three idealized, essentially pure physical counterparts called passive components.   In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of potential energy is associated with a physical property called elasticity or stiffness, and can be represented by a stretched spring.  In electronic science, potential energy is stored in a capacitor instead of a spring. This property is called capacitance instead of elasticity or stiffness.    In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of kinetic energy is associated with a physical property called inertia or mass, and can be represented by a mass or a flywheel in motion.  In electronic science, kinetic energy is stored in an inductor (in a magnetic field) instead of a mass. This property is called inductance instead of inertia.    In the science of physical mechanics, the phenomenon of energy dissipation is associated with a physical property called friction or resistance, and can be represented by a dashpot or other device which converts energy into heat.  In electronic science, dissipation of energy is performed by an element called either a resistor or a conductor, the term "resistor" being the one generally used to describe a more ideal device (e.g., wire) employed to convey electronic energy efficiently from one location to another. The property of a resistance or conductor is measured as either resistance or conductance reciprocals.   In economics these three energy concepts are associated with:  Economic Capacitance  Capital (money, stock/inventory, investments in buildings and durables, etc.)  Economic Conductance  Goods (production flow coefficients)  Economic Inductance  Services (the influence of the population of industry on output)  All of the mathematical theory developed in the study of one energy system (e.g., mechanics, electronics, etc.) can be immediately applied in the study of any other energy system (e.g., economics).  Mr. Rothchild's Energy Discovery  What Mr. Rothschild had discovered was the basic principle of power, influence, and control over people as applied to economics. That principle is "when you assume the appearance of power, people soon give it to you."  Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency or deposit loan accounts had the required appearance of power that could be used to induce people (inductance, with people corresponding to a magnetic field) into surrendering their real wealth in exchange for a promise of greater wealth (instead of real compensation). They would put up real collateral in exchange for a loan of promissory notes. Mr. Rothschild found that he could issue more notes than he had backing for, so long as he had someone's stock of gold as a persuader to show his customers.   Mr. Rothschild loaned his promissory notes to individual and to governments. These would create overconfidence. Then he would make money scarce, tighten control of the system, and collect the collateral through the obligation of contracts. The cycle was then repeated. These pressures could be used to ignite a war. Then he would control the availability of currency to determine who would win the war. That government which agreed to give him control of its economic system got his support.   Collection of debts was guaranteed by economic aid to the enemy of the debtor. The profit derived from this economic methodology mad Mr. Rothschild all the more able to expand his wealth. He found that the public greed would allow currency to be printed by government order beyond the limits (inflation) of backing in precious metal or the production of goods and services.   Apparent Capital as "Paper" Inductor  In this structure, credit, presented as a pure element called "currency," has the appearance of capital, but is in effect negative capital. Hence, it has the appearance of service, but is in fact, indebtedness or debt. It is therefore an economic inductance instead of an economic capacitance, and if balanced in no other way, will be balanced by the negation of population (war, genocide). The total goods and services represent real capital called the gross national product, and currency may be printed up to this level and still represent economic capacitance; but currency printed beyond this level is subtractive, represents the introduction of economic inductance, and constitutes notes of indebtedness.  War is therefore the balancing of the system by killing the true creditors (the public which we have taught to exchange true value for inflated currency) and falling back on whatever is left of the resources of nature and regeneration of those resources.   Mr. Rothschild had discovered that currency gave him the power to rearrange the economic structure to his own advantage, to shift economic inductance to those economic positions which would encourage the greatest economic instability and oscillation.   The final key to economic control had to wait until there was sufficient data and high-speed computing equipment to keep close watch on the economic oscillations created by price shocking and excess paper energy credits - paper inductance/inflation.   Breakthrough  The aviation field provided the greatest evolution in economic engineering by way of the mathematical theory of shock testing. In this process, a projectile is fired from an airframe on the ground and the impulse of the recoil is monitored by vibration transducers connected to the airframe and wired to chart recorders.  By studying the echoes or reflections of the recoil impulse in the airframe, it is possible to discover critical vibrations in the structure of the airframe which either vibrations of the engine or aeolian vibrations of the wings, or a combination of the two, might reinforce resulting in a resonant self-destruction of the airframe in flight as an aircraft. From the standpoint of engineering, this means that the strengths and weaknesses of the structure of the airframe in terms of vibrational energy can be discovered and manipulated.   Application in Economics  To use this method of airframe shock testing in economic engineering, the prices of commodities are shocked, and the public consumer reaction is monitored. The resulting echoes of the economic shock are interpreted theoretically by computers and the psycho-economic structure of the economy is thus discovered. It is by this process that partial differential and difference matrices are discovered that define the family household and make possible its evaluation as an economic industry (dissipative consumer structure).  Then the response of the household to future shocks can be predicted and manipulated, and society becomes a well-regulated animal with its reins under the control of a sophisticated computer-regulated social energy bookkeeping system.   Eventually every individual element of the structure comes under computer control through a knowledge of personal preferences, such knowledge guaranteed by computer association of consumer preferences (universal product code, UPC; zebra-striped pricing codes on packages) with identified consumers (identified via association with the use of a credit card and later a permanent "tattooed" body number invisible under normal ambient illumination).   The Economic Model  The Harvard Economic Research Project (1948-) was an extension of World War II Operations Research. Its purpose was to discover the science of controlling an economy: at first the American economy, and then the world economy. It was felt that with sufficient mathematical foundation and data, it would be nearly as easy to predict and control the trend of an economy as to predict and control the trajectory of a projectile. Such has proven to be the case. Moreover, the economy has been transformed into a guided missile on target.  The immediate aim of the Harvard project was to discover the economic structure, what forces change that structure, how the behavior of the structure can be predicted, and how it can be manipulated. What was needed was a well-organized knowledge of the mathematical structures and interrelationships of investment, production, distribution, and consumption.   To make a short story of it all, it was discovered that an economy obeyed the same laws as electricity and that all of the mathematical theory and practical and computer know-how developed for the electronic field could be directly applied in the study of economics. This discovery was not openly declared, and its more subtle implications were and are kept a closely guarded secret, for example that in an economic model, human life is measured in dollars, and that the electric spark generated when opening a switch connected to an active inductor is mathematically analogous to the initiation of war.   The greatest hurdle which theoretical economists faced was the accurate description of the household as an industry. This is a challenge because consumer purchases are a matter of choice which in turn is influenced by income, price, and other economic factors.   This hurdle was cleared in an indirect and statistically approximate way by an application of shock testing to determine the current characteristics, called current technical coefficients, of a household industry   Finally, because problems in theoretical electronics can be translated very easily into problems of theoretical electronics, and the solution translated back again, it follows that only a book of language translation and concept definition needed to be written for economics. The remainder could be gotten from standard works on mathematics and electronics. This makes the publication of books on advanced economics unnecessary, and greatly simplifies project security.   Industrial Diagrams  An ideal industry is defined as a device which receives value from other industries in several forms and converts them into one specific product for sales and distribution to other industries. It has several inputs and one output. What the public normally thinks of as one industry is really an industrial complex, where several industries under one roof produce one or more products . . .  Three Industrial Classes  Industries fall into three categories or classes by type of output:   Class #1 - Capital (resources)  Class #2 - Goods (commodities or use - dissipative)  Class #3 - Services (action of population)    Class #1 industries exist at three levels:  Nature - sources of energy and raw materials.  Government - printing of currency equal to the gross national product (GNP), and extension of currency in excess of GNP.  Banking - loaning of money for interest, and extension (inflation/counterfeiting) of economic value through the deposit loan accounts.    Class #2 industries exist as producers of tangible or consumer (dissipated) products. This sort of activity is usually recognized and labeled by the public as "industry."   Class #3 industries are those which have service rather than a tangible product as their output. These industries are called (1) households, and (2) governments. Their output is human activity of a mechanical sort, and their basis is population.  Aggregation  The whole economic system can be represented by a three-industry model if one allows the names of the outputs to be (1) capital, (2) goods, and (3) services. The problem with this representation is that it would not show the influence, say, the textile industry on the ferrous metal industry. This is because both the textile industry and the ferrous metal industry would be contained within a single classification called the "goods industry" and by this process of combining or aggregating these two industries under one system block they would lose their economic individuality.  The E-Model  A national economy consists of simultaneous flows of production, distribution, consumption, and investment. If all of these elements including labor and human functions are assigned a numerical value in like units of measure, say, 1939 dollars, then this flow can be further represented by a current flow in an electronic circuit, and its behavior can be predicted and manipulated with useful precision.  The three ideal passive energy components of electronics, the capacitor, the resistor, and the inductor correspond to the three ideal passive energy components of economics called the pure industries of capital, goods, and services, respectively.    Economic capacitance represents the storage of capital in one form or another.   Economic conductance represents the level of conductance of materials for the production of goods.   Economic inductance represents the inertia of economic value in motion. This is a population phenomenon known as services.  Economic Inductance  An electrical inductor (e.g., a coil or wire) has an electric current as its primary phenomenon and a magnetic field as its secondary phenomenon (inertia). Corresponding to this, an economic inductor has a flow of economic value as its primary phenomenon and a population field as its secondary field phenomenon of inertia. When the flow of economic value (e.g., money) diminishes, the human population field collapses in order to keep the economic value (money) flowing (extreme case - war).  This public inertia is a result of consumer buying habits, expected standard of living, etc., and is generally a phenomenon of self-preservation.   Inductive Factors to Consider  Population  Magnitude of the economic activities of the government  The method of financing these government activities (See Peter-Paul Principle - inflation of the currency.)  Translation  (a few examples will be given.)  Charge  coulombs - dollars (1939).  Flow/Current  amperes (coulombs per second) - dollars of flow per year.  Motivating Force  volts - dollars (output) demand.  Conductance  amperes per volt - dollars of flow per year per dollar demand.  Capacitance  coulombs per volt - dollars of production inventory/stock per dollar demand.  Time Flow Relationships and Self-Destructive Oscillations  An ideal industry may be symbolized electronically in various ways. The simplest way is to represent a demand by a voltage and a supply by a current. When this is done, the relationship between the two becomes what is called an admittance, which can result from three economic factors: (1) foresight flow, (2) present flow, and (3) hindsight flow.   Foresight flow is the result of that property of living entities to cause energy (food) to be stored for a period of low energy (e.g., a winter season). It consists of demands made upon an economic system for that period of low energy (winter season).  In a production industry it takes several forms, one of which is known as production stock or inventory. In electronic symbology this specific industry demand (a pure capital industry) is represented by capacitance and the stock or resource is represented by a stored charge. Satisfaction of an industry demand suffers a lag because of the loading effect of inventory priorities.    Present flow ideally involves no delays. It is, so to speak, input today for output today, a "hand to mouth" flow. In electronic symbology, this specific industry demand (a pure us industry) is represented by a conductance which is then a simple economic valve (a dissipative element).   Hindsight flow is known as habit or inertia. In electronics this phenomenon is the characteristic of an inductor (economic analog = a pure service industry) in which a current flow (economic analog = flow of money) creates a magnetic field (economic analog = active human population) which, if the current (money flow) begins to diminish, collapse (war) to maintain the current (flow of money - energy).  Other large alternatives to war as economic inductors or economic flywheels are an open-ended social welfare program, or an enormous (but fruitful) open-ended space program.    The problem with stabilizing the economic system is that there is too much demand on account of (1) too much greed and (2) too much population.  This creates excessive economic inductance which can only be balanced with economic capacitance (true resources or value - e.g., in goods or services).   The social welfare program is nothing more than an open-ended credit balance system which creates a false capital industry to give nonproductive people a roof over their heads and food in their stomachs. This can be useful, however, because the recipients become state property in return for the "gift," a standing army for the elite. For he who pays the piper picks the tune.   Those who get hooked on the economic drug, must go to the elite for a fix. In this, the method of introducing large amounts of stabilizing capacitance is by borrowing on the future "credit" of the world. This is a fourth law of motion - onset, and consists of performing an action and leaving the system before the reflected reaction returns to the point of action - a delayed reaction.   The means of surviving the reaction is by changing the system before the reaction can return. By this means, politicians become more popular in their own time and the public pays later. In fact, the measure of such a politician is the delay time.   The same thing is achieved by a government by printing money beyond the limit of the gross national product, and economic process called inflation. This puts a large quantity of money into the hands of the public and maintains a balance against their greed, creates a false self-confidence in them and, for awhile, stays the wolf from the door.   They must eventually resort to war to balance the account, because war ultimately is merely the act of destroying the creditor, and the politicians are the publicly hired hit men that justify the act to keep the responsibility and blood off the public conscience. (See section on consent factors and social-economic structuring.)   If the people really cared about their fellow man, they would control their appetites (greed, procreation, etc.) so that they would not have to operate on a credit or welfare social system which steals from the worker to satisfy the bum.   Since most of the general public will not exercise restraint, there are only two alternatives to reduce the economic inductance of the system.    Let the populace bludgeon each other to death in war, which will only result in a total destruction of the living earth.  Take control of the world by the use of economic "silent weapons" in a form of "quiet warfare" and reduce the economic inductance of the world to a safe level by a process of benevolent slavery and genocide.  The latter option has been taken as the obviously better option. At this point it should be crystal clear to the reader why absolute secrecy about the silent weapons is necessary. The general public refuses to improve its own mentality and its faith in its fellow man. It has become a herd of proliferating barbarians, and, so to speak, a blight upon the face of the earth.  They do not care enough about economic science to learn why they have not been able to avoid war despite religious morality, and their religious or self-gratifying refusal to deal with earthly problems renders the solution of the earthly problem unreachable to them.   It is left to those few who are truly willing to think and survive as the fittest to survive, to solve the problem for themselves as the few who really care. Otherwise, exposure of the silent weapon would destroy our only hope of preserving the seed of the future true humanity...   The Household Industry  The industries of finance (banking), manufacturing, and government, real counterparts of the pure industries of capital, goods, and services, are easily defined because they are generally logically structured. Because of this their processes can be described mathematically and their technical coefficients can be easily deduced. This, however, is not the case with the service industry known as the household industry.  Household Models  ...The problem which a theoretical economist faces is that the consumer preferences of any household is not easily predictable and the technical coefficients of any one household tend to be a nonlinear, very complex, and variable function of income, prices, etc.  Computer information derived from the use of the universal product code in conjuction with credit-card purchase as an individual household identifier could change this state of affairs, but the U.P.C. method is not yet available on a national or even a significant regional scale. To compensate for this data deficiency, an alternate indirect approach of analysis has been adopted known as economic shock testing. This method, widely used in the aircraft manufacturing industry, develops an aggregate statistical sort of data.   Applied to economics, this means that all of the households in one region or in the whole nation are studied as a group or class rather than individually, and the mass behavior rather than the individual behavior is used to discover useful estimates of the technical coefficients governing the economic structure of the hypothetical single-household industry...   One method of evaluating the technical coefficients of the household industry depends upon shocking the prices of a commodity and noting the changes in the sales of all of the commodities.   Economic Shock Testing  In recent times, the application of Operations Research to the study of the public economy has been obvious for anyone who understands the principles of shock testing.  In the shock testing of an aircraft airframe, the recoil impulse of firing a gun mounted on that airframe causes shock waves in that structure which tell aviation engineers the conditions under which some parts of the airplane or the whole airplane or its wings will start to vibrate or flutter like a guitar string, a flute reed, or a tuning fork, and disintegrate or fall apart in flight.   Economic engineers achieve the same result in studying the behavior of the economy and the consumer public by carefully selecting a staple commodity such as beef, coffee, gasoline, or sugar, and then causing a sudden change or shock in its price or availability, thus kicking everybody's budget and buying habits out of shape.   They then observe the shock waves which result by monitoring the changes in advertising, prices, and sales of that and other commodities.   The objective of such studies is to acquire the know-how to set the public economy into a predictable state of motion or change, even a controlled self-destructive state of motion which will convince the public that certain "expert" people should take control of the money system and reestablish security (rather than liberty and justice) for all. When the subject citizens are rendered unable to control their financial affairs, they, of course, become totally enslaved, a source of cheap labor.   Not only the prices of commodities, but also the availability of labor can be used as the means of shock testing. Labor strikes deliver excellent tests shocks to an economy, especially in the critical service areas of trucking (transportation), communication, public utilities (energy, water, garbage collection), etc.   By shock testing, it is found that there is a direct relationship between the availability of money flowing in an economy and the real psychological outlook and response of masses of people dependent upon that availability.   For example, there is a measurable quantitative relationship between the price of gasoline and the probability that a person would experience a headache, feel a need to watch a violent movie, smoke a cigarette, or go to a tavern for a mug of beer.   It is most interesting that, by observing and measuring the economic models by which the public tries to run from their problems and escape from reality, and by applying the mathematical theory of Operations Research, it is possible to program computers to predict the most probable combination of created events (shocks) which will bring about a complete control and subjugation of the public through a subversion of the public economy (by shaking the plum tree)...   Introduction to Economic Amplifiers  Economic amplifiers are the active components of economic engineering. The basic characteristic of any amplifier (mechanical, electrical, or economic) is that it receives an input control signal and delivers energy from an independent energy source to a specified output terminal in a predictable relationship to that input control signal.  The simplest form of an economic amplifier is a device called advertising.   If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due to suggestibility, he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach into his economic reservoir and deliver its energy to but that product on impulse when he passes it in the store.   An economic amplifier may have several inputs and output. Its response might be instantaneous or delayed. Its circuit symbol might be a rotary switch if its options are exclusive, qualitative, "go" or "no-go", or it might have its parametric input/output relationships specified by a matrix with internal energy sources represented.   Whatever its form might be, its purpose is to govern the flow of energy from a source to an output sink in direct relationship to an input control signal. For this reason, it is called an active circuit element or component.   Economic Amplifiers fall into classes called strategies, and, in comparison with electronic amplifiers, the specific internal functions of an economic amplifier are called logistical instead of electrical.   Therefore, economic amplifiers not only deliver power gain but also, in effect, are used to cause changes in the economic circuitry.   In the design of an economic amplifier we must have some idea of at least five functions, which are:    the available input signals  the desired output-control objectives,  the strategic objective,  the available economic power sources,  the logistical options.  The process of defining and evaluating these factors and incorporating the economic amplifier into an economic system has been popularly called game theory.  The design of an economic amplifier begins with a specification of the power level of the output, which can range from personal to national. The second condition is accuracy of response, i.e., how accurately the output action is a function of the input commands. High gain combined with strong feedback helps to deliver the required precision.   Most of the error will be in the input data signal. Personal input data tends to be specified, while national input data tends to be statistical.

Diversion, the Primary Strategy  Experience has prevent that the simplest method of securing a silent weapon and gaining control of the public is to keep the public undisciplined and ignorant of the basic system principles on the one hand, while keeping them confused, disorganized, and distracted with matters of no real importance on the other hand.  This is achieved by:    disengaging their minds; sabotaging their mental activities; providing a low-quality program of public education in mathematics, logic, systems design and economics; and discouraging technical creativity.   engaging their emotions, increasing their self-indulgence and their indulgence in emotional and physical activities, by:  unrelenting emotional affrontations and attacks (mental and emotional rape) by way of constant barrage of sex, violence, and wars in the media - especially the T.V. and the newspapers.  giving them what they desire - in excess - "junk food for thought" - and depriving them of what they really need.    rewriting history and law and subjecting the public to the deviant creation, thus being able to shift their thinking from personal needs to highly fabricated outside priorities.  These preclude their interest in and discovery of the silent weapons of social automation technology.  The general rule is that there is a profit in confusion; the more confusion, the more profit. Therefore, the best approach is to create problems and then offer solutions.   Diversion Summary  Media: Keep the adult public attention diverted away from the real social issues, and captivated by matters of no real importance.  Schools: Keep the young public ignorant of real mathematics, real economics, real law, and real history.   Entertainment: Keep the public entertainment below a sixth-grade level.   Work: Keep the public busy, busy, busy, with no time to think; back on the farm with the other animals.   Consent, the Primary Victory  A silent weapon system operates upon data obtained from a docile public by legal (but not always lawful) force. Much information is made available to silent weapon systems programmers through the Internal Revenue Service. (See Studies in the Structure of the American Economy for an I.R.S. source list.)  This information consists of the enforced delivery of well-organized data contained in federal and state tax forms, collected, assembled, and submitted by slave labor provided by taxpayers and employers.   Furthermore, the number of such forms submitted to the I.R.S. is a useful indicator of public consent, an important factor in strategic decision making. Other data sources are given in the Short List of Inputs.   Consent Coefficients - numerical feedback indicating victory status. Psychological basis: When the government is able to collect tax and seize private property without just compensation, it is an indication that the public is ripe for surrender and is consenting to enslavement and legal encroachment. A good and easily quantified indicator of harvest time is the number of public citizens who pay income tax despite an obvious lack of reciprocal or honest service from the government.   Amplification Energy Sources  The next step in the process of designing an economic amplifier is discovering the energy sources. The energy sources which support any primitive economic system are, of course, a supply of raw materials, and the consent of the people to labor and consequently assume a certain rank, position, level, or class in the social structure, i.e., to provide labor at various levels in the pecking order.  Each class, in guaranteeing its own level of income, controls the class immediately below it, hence preserves the class structure. This provides stability and security, but also government from the top.   As time goes on and communication and education improve, the lower-class elements of the social labor structure become knowledgeable and envious of the good things that the upper-class members have. They also begin to attain a knowledge of energy systems and the ability to enforce their rise through the class structure.   This threatens the sovereignty of the elite.   If this rise of the lower classes can be postponed long enough, the elite can achieve energy dominance, and labor by consent no longer will hold a position of an essential energy source.   Until such energy dominance is absolutely established, the consent of people to labor and let others handle their affairs must be taken into consideration, since failure to do so could cause the people to interfere in the final transfer of energy sources to the control of the elite.   It is essential to recognize that at this time, public consent is still an essential key to the release of energy in the process of economic amplification.   Therefore, consent as an energy release mechanism will now be considered.   Logistics  The successful application of a strategy requires a careful study of inputs, outputs, the strategy connecting the inputs and the outputs, and the available energy sources to fuel the strategy. This study is called logistics.  A logistical problem is studied at the elementary level first, and then levels of greater complexity are studied as a synthesis of elementary factors.   This means that a given system is analyzed, i.e., broken down into its subsystems, and these in turn are analyzed, until by this process, one arrives at the logistical "atom," the individual.   The Artificial Womb  From the time a person leaves its mother's womb, its every effort is directed towards building, maintaining, and withdrawing into artificial wombs, various sorts of substitute protective devices or shells.  The objective of these artificial wombs is to provide a stable environment for both stable and unstable activity; to provide a shelter for the evolutionary processes of growth and maturity - i.e., survival; to provide security for freedom and to provide defensive protection for offensive activity.   This is equally true of both the general public and the elite. However, there is a definite difference in the way each of these classes go about the solution of problems.   The Political Structure of a Nation - Dependency  The primary reason why the individual citizens of a country create a political structure is a subconscious wish or desire to perpetuate their own dependency relationship of childhood. Simply put, they want a human god to eliminate all risk from their life, pat them on the head, kiss their bruises, put a chicken on every dinner table, clothe their bodies, tuck them into bed at night, and tell them that everything will be alright when they wake up in the morning.  This public demand is incredible, so the human god, the politician, meets incredibility with incredibility by promising the world and delivering nothing. So who is the bigger liar? the public? or the "godfather"?   This public behavior is surrender born of fear, laziness, and expediency. It is the basis of the welfare state as a strategic weapon, useful against a disgusting public.   Action/Offense  Most people want to be able to subdue and/or kill other human beings which disturb their daily lives, but they do not want to have to cope with the moral and religious issues which such an overt act on their part might raise. Therefore, they assign the dirty work to others (including their own children) so as to keep the blood off their hands. They rave about the humane treatment of animals and then sit down to a delicious hamburger from a whitewashed slaughterhouse down the street and out of sight. But even more hypocritical, they pay taxes to finance a professional association of hit men collectively called politicians, and then complain about corruption in government.  Responsibility  Again, most people want to be free to do the things (to explore, etc.) but they are afraid to fail.  The fear of failure is manifested in irresponsibility, and especially in delegating those personal responsibilities to others where success is uncertain or carries possible or created liabilities (law) which the person is not prepared to accept. They want authority (root word - "author"), but they will not accept responsibility or liability. So they hire politicians to face reality for them.   Summary  The people hire the politicians so that the people can:   obtain security without managing it.  obtain action without thinking about it.  inflict theft, injury, and death upon others without having to contemplate either life or death.  avoid responsibility for their own intentions.  obtain the benefits of reality and science without exerting themselves in the discipline of facing or learning either of these things.  They give the politicians the power to create and manage a war machine to:   provide for the survival of the nation/womb.  prevent encroachment of anything upon the nation/womb.  destroy the enemy who threatens the nation/womb.  destroy those citizens of their own country who do not conform for the sake of stability of the nation/womb.  Politicians hold many quasi-military jobs, the lowest being the police which are soldiers, the attorneys and C.P.A.s next who are spies and saboteurs (licensed), and the judges who shout orders and run the closed union military shop for whatever the market will bear. The generals are industrialists. The "presidential" level of commander-in-chief is shared by the international bankers. The people know that they have created this farce and financed it with their own taxes (consent), but they would rather knuckle under than be the hypocrite.  Thus, a nation becomes divided into two very distinct parts, a docile sub-nation [great silent majority] and a political sub-nation. The political sub-nation remains attached to the docile sub-nation, tolerates it, and leaches its substance until it grows strong enough to detach itself and then devour its parent.   System Analysis  In order to make meaningful computerized economic decisions about war, the primary economic flywheel, it is necessary to assign concrete logistical values to each element of the war structure - personnel and material alike.  This process begins with a clear and candid description of the subsystems of such a structure.   The Draft (As military service)  Few efforts of human behavior modification are more remarkable or more effective than that of the socio-military institution known as the draft. A primary purpose of a draft or other such institution is to instill, by intimidation, in the young males of a society the uncritical conviction that the government is omnipotent. He is soon taught that a prayer is slow to reverse what a bullet can do in an instant. Thus, a man trained in a religious environment for eighteen years of his life can, by this instrument of the government, be broken down, be purged of his fantasies and delusions in a matter of mere months. Once that conviction is instilled, all else becomes easy to instill.  Even more interesting is the process by which a young man's parents, who purportedly love him, can be induced to send him off to war to his death. Although the scope of this work will not allow this matter to be expanded in full detail, nevertheless, a coarse overview will be possible and can serve to reveal those factors which must be included in some numerical form in a computer analysis of social and war systems.   We begin with a tentative definition of the draft. The draft (selective service, etc.) is an institution of compulsory collective sacrifice and slavery, devised by the middle-aged and elderly for the purpose of pressing the young into doing the public dirty work. It further serves to make the youth as guilty as the elders, thus making criticism of the elders by the youth less likely (Generational Stabilizer). It is marketed and and sold to the public under the label of "patriotic = national" service.   Once a candid economic definition of the draft is achieved, that definition is used to outline the boundaries of a structure called a Human Value System, which in turn is translated into the terms of game theory. The value of such a slave laborer is given in a Table of Human Values, a table broken down into categories by intellect, experience, post-service job demand, etc.   Some of these categories are ordinary and can be tentatively evaluated in terms of the value of certain jobs for which a known fee exists. Some jobs are harder to value because they are unique to the demands of social subversion, for an extreme example: the value of a mother's instruction to her daughter, causing that daughter to put certain behavioral demands upon a future husband ten or fifteen years hence; thus, by suppressing his resistance to a perversion of a government, making it easier for a banking cartel to buy the State of New York in, say, twenty years.   Such a problem leans heavily upon the observations and data of wartime espionage and many types of psychological testing. But crude mathematical models (algorithms, etc.) can be devised, if not to predict, at least to predeterminate these events with maximum certainty. What does not exist by natural cooperation is thus enhanced by calculated compulsion. Human beings are machines, levers which may be grasped and turned, and there is little real difference between automating a society and automating a shoe factory.   These derived values are variable. (It is necessary to use a current Table of Human Values for computer analysis.) These values are given in true measure rather than U.S. dollars, since the latter is unstable, being presently inflated beyond the production of national goods and services so as to give the economy a false kinetic energy ("paper" inductance).   The silver value is stable, it being possible to buy the same amount with a gram of silver today as it could be bought in 1920. Human value measured in silver units changes slightly due to changes in production technology.   Enforcement  Factor I  As in every social system approach, stability is achieved only by understanding and accounting for human nature (action/reaction patterns). A failure to do so can be, and usually is, disastrous.  As in other human social schemes, one form or another of intimidation (or incentive) is essential to the success of the draft. Physical principles of action and reaction must be applied to both internal and external subsystems.   To secure the draft, individual brainwashing/programming and both the family unit and the peer group must be engaged and brought under control.   Factor II - Father  The man of the household must be housebroken to ensure that junior will grow up with the right social training and attitudes. The advertising media, etc., are engaged to see to it that father-to-be is pussy-whipped before or by the time he is married. He is taught that he either conforms to the social notch cut out for him or his sex life will be hobbled and his tender companionship will be zero. He is made to see that women demand security more than logical, principled, or honorable behavior.  By the time his son must go to war, father (with jelly for a backbone) will slam a gun into junior's hand before father will risk the censure of his peers, or make a hypocrite of himself by crossing the investment he has in his own personal opinion or self-esteem. Junior will go to war or father will be embarrassed. So junior will go to war, the true purpose not withstanding.   Factor III - Mother  The female element of human society is ruled by emotion first and logic second. In the battle between logic and imagination, imagination always wins, fantasy prevails, maternal instinct dominates so that the child comes first and the future comes second. A woman with a newborn baby is too starry-eyed to see a wealthy man's cannon fodder or a cheap source of slave labor. A woman must, however, be conditioned to accept the transition to "reality" when it comes, or sooner.  As the transition becomes more difficult to manage, the family unit must be carefully disintegrated, and state-controlled public education and state-operated child-care centers must be become more common and legally enforced so as to begin the detachment of the child from the mother and father at an earlier age. Inoculation of behavioral drugs [Ritalin] can speed the transition for the child (mandatory). Caution: A woman's impulsive anger can override her fear. An irate woman's power must never be underestimated, and her power over a pussy-whipped husband must likewise never be underestimated. It got women the vote in 1920.   Factor IV - Junior  The emotional pressure for self-preservation during the time of war and the self-serving attitude of the common herd that have an option to avoid the battlefield - if junior can be persuaded to go - is all of the pressure finally necessary to propel Johnny off to war. Their quiet blackmailings of him are the threats: "No sacrifice, no friends; no glory, no girlfriends."  Factor V - Sister  And what about junior's sister? She is given all the good things of life by her father, and taught to expect the same from her future husband regardless of the price.  Factor VI - Cattle  Those who will not use their brains are no better off than those who have no brains, and so this mindless school of jelly-fish, father, mother, son, and daughter, become useful beasts of burden or trainers of the same. ----------------  Isn't reading fun kids? =)

      To the racists:   You are the very definition of an inferior race of beings. You claim that other races are lesser than you are, however you never once stop to rationalize out the full scope of your statement: A superior race to something lesser would not waste time,money,resources,brain cells,breedings stock, or emotional investments on such a concept. A "superior" race would consider such trivialities as beneath itself, and would persue a higher standard of living and a higher, loftier set of goals, like transcendancy of the death phenomenon, or curing cancer, or trying to travel faster than the speed of THOUGHT. Incidentally, most of us who are NOT on the racist bandwagon, seem to travel faster than the speed of your own.   To the homophobics:   You are not only hiding your own insecurities about this issue, by attacking it you show others just how pitiful and insignificant you truly are, and how you are desperately in search of a "cause", a "belief" in something just so that you matter at all. Were you to die this moment, you would not be missed by any more than a relatively small number of human peers, and many would in fact rejoice. Go extinct.   To those with self-imposed ignorance, and thus political DELUSION:   You believe that George Bush is an honest man of your "god". You base this on the fact that he quotes the name of that deity and his "scriptures. You base this on the American founding principles, which, if you read your history from a non-biased source, tells quite another tale altogether. You impose your own iron-willed stupidity and attack anyone who is not on your side of the fence, when, in all reality, you are part of the herd of cattle which has absolutely no idea, WHATSOEVER, what is actually happening in the world around you. You have no hope. Die.   To those who blame the arab world for American bloodshed at home and abroad:   Learn to read news reports besides those on foxnews and cnn, and also your local "gazette". The world is a far bigger place than you believe it to be, and human arrogance and shrink-wrapped world views will be your ultimate destruction. The arab world has as many if not more political and personal issues than the American nation, but they are not solely to blame here. You want to attack an entire NATION over the actions of a single millionare and his minions, which incidentally, although associated with aforementioned country's leader, WERE TOTALLY SEPARATE in this issue of terrorism. History speaks for me. Saddam was ARMED, ISNTALLED, and FUNDED by THE UNITED STATES. This is not a deslusion, it is public information, if you simply look. Case in point, when Saddam was "found in a hole in the ground" he had almost 250,000.00 dollars in FRESH, U.S. issue currency. That kind of monetary stash is not simply withdrawn from Baghdad savings and MOAN. But you don't hear that part on your 6 o-clock special on CBS do you kids? Learn to think for yourself, and compare journalistic sources from as many differing pipelines as you can before you condemn, attack, and curse at those you know nothing of. Enemy or not, the people of iraq are dying, in large numbers, and only a madman or a charlatan would not see human evil on both sides. Stop deluding yourself!   To those who think abortion is murder:   If you think so, make you point in a sane manner. Stop telling me that abortion is murder but KILLING abortion doctors!   To those who think abortion is fine and dandy:   Stop the argument and just do it. If you want to go forward, stop making it a political issue and make it a personal one. Do what you think is right.   To those in the music industry:   Stop suing your bread and butter, dumbfucks! You may think you are saving your industry with all the lawsuits, but you fail to realize how good you have it. It costs you LITERALLY 15 cents per cd to manufacture a cd for an artist. You make more money from PROMO sales than all your other sales combined (skeptics can check forbes, nasdaq, etc). realize that bands like 'metallica' were a virtual UNKNOWN to many of the people who spread around their files, and their album sales have risen since that controversy began. We do you a service. Suck us off...   To those who write poetry and become discouraged:   Stop allowing the opinions of others to affect whether or not your write at all. I am a firm believer in what my professors shared once: "The only bad poem is the one you did not write down because you feared ridicule". This ideal can also fit into musicians' lives, as well as authors of prose, and any other medium where human expression is called into question. If you write poems, you are a poet. It is not a mystical right of passage, nor some sage art of mythical proportions. It is as old as written language, and you, as being a poet and writing poems, are a part of that legacy of creation. Never stop writing, and find your place...   To those who want to be heard:   No matter how many people shout you down, somewhere, perhaps unseen by you, someone IS ACTUALLY listening. Maybe they are too shy to speak up, or maybe feel you would be offended or put off, but someone IS out there, and you can share and be shared with. Your ideas, by virtue of the fact that you have them and want them expressed, mattered. Well received or not, they matter Share them.   To humanity as a whole:   We are creatures of habit. There is no game of semantics that can assault me on this point. We do what we do, and we continually strive to criticize those who are different, independent, or simply refusing to go along. I am declaring war on my species, the side of it who is racist, ignorant, hateful, fearful, stagnant, repressive, suicidally complacent, and corporate. You will never own or control me beyond little things that matter little in the big picture. I deny you. You ARE the weakest fucking link!   In closing, lyrics from a song from my favorite band, to sum up this entire line of thought processes:   "Jihad"   Homo sapiens a dying species  Poor sick dumb numb feeding feces  Half-eaten starved beaten multiplying lying cheating  Lean mean unclean ammo for the gun-machine   Cannonfodder driven by fear  Last-class raw mass victims of the puppeteer  Human driftwood lepers pariah  Suicide bombers for the new messiah   Everybody do your part  Hope is life and fire to the heart   Rattle your chains  Never back down  Blow your brains  Stand your ground   Plutocratic rule and power  Rich fat small balls' final hour  Big last gulp end of reign  Flush dictators down the drain

      I have been noticing with increasing personal happiness that my writing has become more refined, and is tighter, more controlled, and flows more freely. I have always had an issue with my ideas pouring out of my head faster than I can hand-write them, so typing my poetry and whatnot is so much more rich an experience for me when I type. I have always loved to engage in writing down ideas, much like my best friend tries to sketh out his own before acting on them *grin*.  Lately, I have begun to also take alot more photographs of my meanderings around here, and I have captured some nifty images that I feel are worth posting here. So, my next blog session, i might post some of those. =)

       I told them that in the long run, the rampant disregard for the site as a whole, and the apparent lack of solid leadership and compassion would lead to what you are about to read. I told them that, despite the constant attacks at my person, and the defending of a sexual predator who openly admitted to be predatory with females would lead to discord and rampant madness. I told them that as long as I could hold out, I would stick up for the little guy. I told them that they could just fucking deal with it. Then I got banned. Then the site was rebuilt and I was UNBANNED. Then I was shown the new site layout and the offerings there. Few people could fathom the new layout, and the idiot who runs this lovely little cesspool of 16 year old goth-angst put a madman at the helm as a moderator. My repeated attempts to help them, and my repeated attempts to dissuade the fuck tards to desist, went ignored, or outright rebuffed. This is the result. I am sure when the admin of the site looks at his logs and finds the source of the problem described below, several recurring canadian IP's will show plain as fuckin day!  What can I say? Reap what you sow fuck heads! Death to ingrates! =)   "Hallo,  This is just a quick note to let everyone know that the server recently has undergone several hack attempts. It has been infected with one or more trojans acting as a backdoor. Obviously this is something serious, so I'm not going to take chances and leave the site up and online until the virus is contained and removed and the connection is secure and ready to run online.  Obviously this means I will need to put up a bit more protection for the server than what I had going (nothing more than a few blocked ports and norton anti-virus running).  The infection seemed to be a serious one. It started by slowing down the server and boosting the CPU up to 100% at times. Then I noticed, many executables were running without me telling them to. After removing several of them, they just kept coming back. I tried to run norton anti-virus but it would crash repeatedly when launched. I even downloaded two more anti-virus programs and attempted to install them, but it would crash when the installation was nearly complete. Even worse, either the hacker or virus disabled Norton anti-virus and prevented it from running. I couldn't even load of Norton's website. It would send me to the 404 page at TT! The same thing happened when I tried loading up McAfee's website.  After over a day of playing with other hard drives and trying to find someway to enter into Windows to either back up the site or quarantine the files, I was able to install Kaspersky anti-virus. It is currently running as I speak and has found 13 viruses (7 being different).  The infection also came with keylogging, so whoever hacked the server has been logging all the keys I type (used to steal passwords and such).  Fortunately it looks like the removal is going okay. In anycase, the site is safe and will be backed up right now and as soon as I get it running again I will need to change all my passwords and keep things a little more secure.  Sorry for the inconvenience. I will notify you again (in probably 24-48 hours) when I get the infections taken care of and the site back online.  Thanks for the time, Lev"

      When faced with the silences, a person has the best attenuated moments to think freely, and without distraction. I have such a time as that here and now, to ponder things. In my mind, I am attempting to fathom just what it is that is wrong with our race.   Alot can be said for an educated person, one who feel she or he can relate to those in pain and those that suffer. Alot can also be said for aforementioned persons being able to understand war and all the myriad things it deals with on a human, sane level. Others, it seems, can only bitch and complain.   War is often-times associated with land disputes, ethnic cleansing, economical motivations, racism, or about 300 other items, mostly religion in the modern world, for all intents and puporses. Indeed, by all appearances, it would seem that mankind just cannot agree on who's god has a larger septum.   I disagree with all people who, both professionally or privately, feel they have the inside track on why for, and what for, war exists. It seems in fashion to blame it on political crap, or religious zealotry, or what have you, but in my mind, it has nothing to do with those things, and everything to do with human evil.   I believe in the existence of evil, but not the demons are jacking off in my sock drawer kind, or god is angry at his chosen pimply assed kids kind. No, I believe that, when unchecked, human evil is the most perverse form that negation can take.   Is war about religious iconography laced in evil and the end of the world? No, it is about people killing each other. Motives need not apply. Killing is big business, and business is booming. Will the world end someday? No, it will go on without us staining her shores...  It is another Sunday afternoon, and in my head there are 100 billion explosions. I cannot relate to you in any significant manner, other than to say that when I believe myself to be alone, nothing you can say will negate it, and nothing you do will, can, nor wants to, reverse it. I am alone with my thoughts, and I accept it as it comes.  I have nothing else to say for a while, lest I become enraged and end a life...

      It is nearly 2 a.m.  I went to bed at about 6:45 p.m. I woke at 11:30 p.m.  It was storming outside like hell when I layed down, and I had the window open and listened to it for a while before succumbing to slumber. I recall dreaming something eerie, a sound effect was looping in my dream as images flashed of something creepy and damp etc. I woke up with a "wtf" look on my face. Nothing new.  Just sitting here, listening to a new track I made and wondering if the new job will kill me in the long run. Oh well...

      Ian Mulgrew   Vancouver Sun  Saturday, February 23, 2002    AP Files / President George W. Bush continued speaking to kids after the attack ... hmm.  Ê    Reuter Files / The World Trade Center towers explode and burn after being hit by planes Sept. 11.       "The right wing benefited so much from September 11 that, if I were still a conspiratorialist, I would believe they'd done it."  Norman Mailer  When the paladin of Camelot joined the fray, I knew 9/11 had become the Kennedy Assassination of the 21st century -- a real-life X-Files episode occurring before my eyes. Like those X-Files accounts of aliens living in oil deposits, this was a story with such staggering implications the mainstream media are loath to go near it. The question isn't who killed the president -- it's who piloted the airplanes that slammed into the World Trade Center towers, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvanian countryside.  Just as there remains lingering doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald fired a burst of fatally accurate shots from the Texas Book Depository, so there is skepticism that cells of Islamic terrorists secretly coordinated and simultaneously commandeered four commercial jetliners.  The culprit responsible for the Sept. 11 attack is now rumoured to be the same one who lurked behind the grassy knoll: the oil-dependent U.S. military-industrial complex.  Not everyone is ready to accept this -- a substitute teacher in North Vancouver's Sherwood Park elementary school has been called on the mat for suggesting to Grade 5 students the Central Intelligence Agency might have been involved in 9/11.  And at last count, there were a dozen U.S. Congressional Committees investigating the tragedies and how such an intelligence and security breakdown was allowed to occur.   But President George W. Bush and his right-hand man, Vice President Dick Cheney, have taken the unprecedented step of trying to restrict those investigations, pouring fuel on the simmering conspiracy theories being propagated in alternative publications, on wingnut Web sites and among some serious media outlets.  In Germany, a former minister of technology, Andreas von Buelow, made headlines when in an interview he dismissed the U.S. government's explanation that Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida network is responsible for the attacks. His own explanation implicated the White House.  "I wonder why many questions are not asked," von Buelow said. "For 60 decisive minutes, the military and intelligence agencies let the fighter planes stay on the ground; 48 hours later, however, the FBI presented a list of suicide attackers. Within 10 days, it emerged that seven of them were still alive."  In Britain, a flight engineer has published a detailed paper asserting the U.S. took the joysticks out of the pilots' hands using a method of remote control developed by the American military in the 1970s.  In the U.S. and Canada, independent publisher and editor Mike Ruppert (a former LAPD cop who hates the CIA) has drawn huge crowds to his two-hour lecture in which he states baldly that the U.S. government was complicit in the attacks and had foreknowledge. He opens his documentary presentation with an offer of $1,000 US to anyone who can prove any of his sources were misrepresented or inauthentic.  A former U.S. government agent also has given interviews claiming the CIA has been dealing with Osama bin Laden since 1987.  According to those who do not believe in The Lone Gunman, the truth is as plain as the nose on your face: Sept. 11's terrorist acts were planned and paid for by the CIA to enable the Bush Administration to "legitimately" bomb Afghanistan into submission on behalf of the oil industry.  After all, everyone knows the Bush family has strong and long acknowledged ties to the oil industry, as do other senior members of the administration. Cheney until recently was president of a company servicing the oil patch. National Security adviser Condoleeza Rice was a manager for Chevron. Commerce and Energy Secretaries Donald Evans and Stanley Abraham worked for Tom Brown, another oil giant.  Follow the money, as they say, and you'll find the smoking gun.  Under this scenario, conspiracy theorists say a pliant Afghan regime was essential because of plans to pipe central Asian oil across Afghanistan. And there is a harvest of coincidence and contradiction to feed such imaginings.   Consider first that the intelligence breakdown that led to 9/11 appears to have been a consequence of the Bush Administration telling the Federal Bureau of Investigation to back off on its investigation of Middle Eastern terrorism. A senior FBI investigator resigned from the agency, noisily claiming its main obstacle in the investigation was Big Oil's political influence. In an ironic twist of fate, the agent died in the World Trade Center.  (Fox Mulder, was that you? Is that why they cancelled the series?)  There also are recurring reports the CIA station chief in Dubai met with bin Laden only seven weeks before 9/11 while he was laid up for surgery. (The CIA denies this, but of course you can't believe anything it says.)  Now think about this for a second: The Independent in London questions how Bush could claim in two public appearances to have seen the first plane hit the first tower long before any such TV footage was broadcast. The paper also asks why Dubya continued sitting with elementary school students after the second tower was hit and he'd been told, "America is under attack."  Very mysterious, when standard procedure for such a situation is to whisk the president away to safety. Unless -- and here is the nub -- unless he knew something more than we did that morning. As the Independent asked, "What television station was HE watching?"  This is rich stuff for those who see Them under the bed, especially since the financial miasma melds nicely with the already swirling rumour and insinuation.  In the days before the attacks, there was unusually heavy trading in airline and related stocks using a market tactic called a "put option" that essentially bets that a stock will decline in value. If you were Osama, buying puts would be a great way to boost the value of your investment portfolio.  And sure enough, unusually high numbers of put options were purchased in early September for the stocks of AMR Corp. and UAL Corp., the parents of American and United -- each of which had two planes hijacked. The U.S. government is now investigating suspicious trading in 38 companies directly affected by the events of Sept. 11.  The initial survey of beneficiaries, however, turns out not to include one tall, dark-haired, olive-skinned, Allah-loving, Saudi-born sheik. Mainly the profiteers were blue-chip, establishment, red-white-and-blue Americans, some of whom were tenants in the collapsed twin towers, such as Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Lehman Brothers and the Bank of America, major airlines, cruise companies, General Motors Corp., Raytheon and others. Several insurance companies are also on the 38-name list U.S. and Canadian financial firms were asked to review and compare with their records for any unusual patterns.  (Which may say more about who plays the market than anything else, but why quibble with the quixotic?)  Cynics are also questioning the incredible speed with which evidence in the WTC collapse is being destroyed. Never in the history of fire investigations, they say, has evidence been destroyed before exhaustive investigations are complete.  (Say what? Two skyscrapers' worth of debris should be warehoused?)  And then there were the curious developments swirling around the anthrax public health hysteria triggered shortly after 9/11. Even dullards can appreciate that anthrax sent to a top Democrat and to the U.S. media helped unify the nation behind the war effort while literally shutting down Congress -- a remarkably useful outcome for Dubya and his gang.   Indeed, specialists in biological warfare say the anthrax appears to be a U.S. military strain and the culprit a disgruntled American scientist who possesses a rare combination of laboratory skills that make him (they believe it's a man) relatively easy to identify. Hmmm.  And who didn't smell a bad odour two weeks ago when Tennessee driver's licence examiner Katherine Smith died in Memphis under "most unusual and suspicious" circumstances. One day before her arraignment on charges she conspired to provide phoney licences to five Arabs tied by the FBI to the 9/11 attacks, her car crashed into a utility pole. The car was only slightly damaged, the gas tank was full and intact, but the vehicle was immediately engulfed in flames.   As one report pointed out, Smith and the car interior apparently were doused with gasoline, which would certainly qualify in my book as at least "suspicious."   And Memphis ... Memphis? Wasn't that the same place a noted Harvard bio-warfare expert "fell" off a bridge in December?  Scully!  The truth is out there. I know it. You too can help find it.  If you would like an activist kit to get involved in urging a full public investigation of 9/11 and its aftermath, reply to findtruth 40@hotmail.com with "Send kit."  But be warned.  The Pentagon has just established a new Office of Strategic Influence that calls for the planting of false stories in the foreign press, phoney e-mails from disguised addresses and other covert activities to manipulate public opinion.  This could be one of them.  Ian Mulgrew claims to be a Vancouver Sun reporter.

      Autumn looms and presidential elections will soon roll around, like droppings pushed by dung beetles. We will be exhorted to vote. Better advice would be not to vote. The proper response toward what we occasionally imagine to be democracy, methinks, is to retain one’s self-respect by not participating in it.   Voting in particular is an embarrassment, being a public display of weak character and low intelligence. Let us face the truth: Democracy, like spitting in public or the Roman games, is the proper activity of the lower intellectual and moral classes. It amounts to collusion in one's own suckering.   The United States of course is not a democracy but a wonderfully crafted pretense. We have separated the results of elections from the formulation of policy. It is a neat trick: Voting distracts the rabble without disturbing the government. You cannot possibly – can you? – believe that your vote will change anything of importance? That it will end the flood of semi-literate Mexican proletarians who join our own? Divert the schools from their ghettoish apotheosis of the mentally lame and halt? Cause governmental behavior to rely on merit instead of race, creed, color, sex, and national origin?   No. These things are determined remotely by lobbies, by criminals, and by forces that have no name. If you are lucky, you may be able to change parking regulations.   Given that democracy is pointless, and participation in it a sign of a weak mind, what is the wisest attitude toward the government?   That of a tick toward a cow. Nothing else makes sense. The central question of American government is not what mountebank shall be president or what eructations of mendacity he may devise. The question, almost the only question, is whether the government can get more from you than you can get from it. One picks pockets, or one’s pockets are picked.  The clever or well represented – the racial lobbies, defense industry, teachers unions, feminists, AIPAC, big pharma, oil, corporations – suck money from the government. In turn the government gnaws like a hagfish at the entrails of middle-class people moldering in cubicles. These spend their lives in jobs they hate to buy things they don’t want, such as half-million-dollar houses in the suburbs, so as to pay taxes. Elections give them a sense of having a stake in their flensing: The government is their hagfish.  Clearly taking part in this is unwise. What then do you do?   First, and most important, stop regarding yourself as part of government. Government doesn’t concern itself with you; why should you concern yourself with it? The change of attitude provides both relaxation and perspective.  Next, avoid governmental impositions. There are many. Military service is the worst of them. Don’t go. A little man in Washington, whom you have never met and wouldn’t talk to over a back fence, tells you to kill people who have done nothing to you in a foreign country you may never have heard of. Does this seem reasonable?  Finally, cultivate apathy, which is cheaper than Prozac and works better. You do not worry about what you do not care about. I do not propose a depressed scowl at life, but merely a wholesome indifference toward those forces malign and otherwise over which you can have no influence.   Better yet, enjoy the onrushing atrophy. Is the United States going to hell, western civilization being subverted, knaves scuttling like fetid crabs through the corridors of power and nitwits ravaging the schools in the manner of monkeys in a fruit store? (Yes, actually.) Relish it for the splendid historical theater that it is. A better spectacle there cannot be.   I say this seriously. If you regard yourself as audience rather than participant, the accelerating collapse becomes entertainment. You read each morning’s headlines with zest to see what new and preposterous clownishness erupts from Washington. It is high comedy. Just now Mr. Bush wants to tighten the embargo on Cuba because of its violations of human rights; meanwhile Mr. Bush is running a torture camp at Guantanamo. We have a war on poverty that perpetuates poverty, a war on drugs that guarantees availability by keeping prices up.   I doubt that Mark Twain could make such things up.  A huge gap separates those who, on the one hand, eat their souls up over things they can’t change, and those who, on the other, focus on their friends, family, children. You probably have a sense of what is right, wrong, moral, decent, and just. To these, I say, you owe allegiance. To nothing else.  A wholesome apathy does not mean giving up a love of music or travel or dogs or books or contemplation of starry skies should the pollution clear momentarily. Nor does it mean lack of concern for those around you. It does mean, or more correctly require, moral self-determination insofar as it is possible.   The wise recognize that they are insignificant atoms and set their course accordingly. Yes, in a small town enjoying sovereignty over its institutions, participation might make sense. You might expect to have an influence over matters material to you. If you wanted the high school to offer advanced classes in mathematics for your advanced child, you would stand a reasonable chance of persuading the school board, and finding a volunteer teacher if need be.   But today you are merely a minor source of taxes. It is reasonable therefore to regard governments not as enemies – they are larger than you are and will usually win – but as intricate puzzles. If the government won’t school your children, do you home-school? Move to France? Can you qualify for some form of welfare and have the government support you instead of you, it? Are laws more to your liking in Thailand?   To what, then, you might ask, does one owe allegiance? A better question might be: Why should one owe allegiance to any distant group beyond one’s influence? Yes, I know: The dog-pack instinct dominates human behavior. It is why we have wars and teen-age gangs and attach ourselves furiously to football teams. Patriotism, meaning an irrational attachment to whatever country we were born in, comes naturally. But does it come reasonably? To use the tired but effective example, should you be loyal to your country’s government if it begins operating torture camps in, say, Bergen-Belsen or Treblinka or, once more, Guantanamo?  -Some guy online had this on his site...I was interested...

      I repeatedly encounter older Americans who strive to make rather simple concepts into complex moral issues. I repeatedly attempt to defend my aforementioned simple ideal, but find myself wondering why I bother? Some people are just too stupid by design or intentional behavior patterns to listen and learn something.  Case in point:  Someone asked me why I do not use drugs. Do I find them immoral? A Sin? or uncool to be around? No, I said honestly "Stupid is what you become when under the influence of some substance." What my meaning was, however noble to my own perception, was lost on this fool. They wanted to make my distate for drugs and users of drugs a moral issue. It has nothing whatsoever to do with what some god thinks about me using his created plants to make msyelf see gummi-bears fuckin in the rain, and everything to do with personal limits on control. Control is the word here.  I like being in control, both in MIND and in BODY. If I inhale a toxic substance and think that aliens are smearing me in honey for a sex-sandwhich, I am not in control of my though-streams am I? Ergo, my disliking of those things.  Is it wrong to use drugs? The terms "morally unsound" and "wrong" are man made. Man makes a lot of things he could do well without. Stupid is man made. Coincidence?

      Okay folks, I have officially been renewed in my musical inspirations. I have some major ideas unfolding, and they are shaping up to be some seriously kickass new tunes for your listening enjoyment. I am also hard at work on the DvD and may delay it another month or so, but the wait will be worth it. Once the DVD is done, I will be hosting a remix contest, and will post the rules and prizes and legalese on that. Stay tuned on this fron, the beats of eons go louder from here!

      Who could catalogue the lies of our times? In fact, the category "lies" hardly covers the matter. Take a simple example, just now on front pages everywhere: the President invites the press in for a post-cabinet-meeting moment. It's the day after the 9/11 Commission staff has delivered a total no-brainer revelation: Months of research, the questioning of experts and intelligence insiders, not to speak of the reading of the interrogation transcripts of top al-Qaeda figures and Iraqi officials all reveal -- gasp -- that there was no "collaboration," no significant connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, just as there were no weapons of mass destruction or mobile biological labs, just as there was no Niger yellowcake deal, just as, the Los Angeles Times reports, U.S. intelligence repeatedly "confused" Iraqi chicken coops with Scud missile sites, just as … oh well.   The President promptly responded to the 9/11 Commission news thusly:    "The reason I keep insisting that there was a relationship between Iraq and Saddam and al Qaeda, because there was a relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda. This administration never said that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated between Saddam and al Qaeda. We did say there were numerous contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda."  Jim Lobe of Inter Press Service comments:    "This is what logicians call a tautology, or a ‘useless repetition,' as the dictionary defines it, but it is also an indication of how the Bush administration is defending itself against a growing number of scandals and deceptions in which it finds itself enmeshed. Repetition and blaming the media, an old standby, of which Vice President Dick Cheney and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld are particularly fond dating back to their service under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford 30 years ago, are back in vogue."  Now, admittedly, the President's use of the word "relationship" calls to mind the "meaning of is" parsings of his predecessor (though on far lesser matters of state). Who knows, after all, what this President thinks a relationship is? Certainly, to take but one example, by such standards the pre-Afghan-war relationship between the Bush administration and the Taliban would have to qualify as a deep friendship. Or, as the editor of the War in Context website puts the matter, "George Bush and John Kerry have a relationship: They are both candidates in the coming presidential election. Assuming that they participate in a debate or two, this will require some level of cooperation. Does this mean that Bush supports the Kerry campaign?"   But what of the other part of the President's statement? Did the "administration" ever say that the 9/11 attacks were "orchestrated between Saddam and al Qaeda?"   Well, just to quote a single Presidential "is" on the subject. Mimi Hall of USA Today notes: "In a letter to Congress on March 19, 2003 -- the day the war in Iraq began -- Bush said that the war was permitted under legislation authorizing force against those who 'planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.'"   And, of course, even when he didn't literally say so -- and Fred Kaplan of Slate points out that the President was generally quite precise in the imprecision of his words -- he constantly associated the two (as did the rest of his crew) even on the rare occasions when he seemed to admit that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11. In last year's State of the Union speech, for instance, with war looming he said: "Imagine those 19 hijackers with other weapons and other plans -- this time armed by Saddam."   His vice president is another matter, however. Unless, of course, you don't consider Dick Cheney part of the "administration," you might have to deal with quotes like this:    "In September, Cheney said on NBC's ‘Meet the Press': ‘If we're successful in Iraq . . . then we will have struck a major blow right at the heart of the base, if you will, the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault now for many years, but most especially on 9/11.'"  By the way, it turns out the President didn't offer his "spontaneous" responses at that post-cabinet-meeting press session in a completely "spontaneous" manner. He had a crib sheet, caught by happenstance in an AP photo, swiveled and blown up thanks to the wonders of modern technology and posted at a blog. According to Dan Froomkin's invaluable White House Briefing column at the Washington Post, it said:    "Saddam Was A Threat -- "Sworn Enemy of US… "Destabilizing Force… "Volatile part of world… "Had Weapons of Mass D . . . "Tied to terrorist orgs . . ."  Ho-hum. Same old, same old. Was was and is is. Oh, and just in case our President froze in that moment of spontaneous interchange while wondering exactly whom to call on to create that same same-old, same-old effect, he just happened to have a well-ordered list of reporters on that crib sheet, the first two of whom he called on before ending the session. If you want to check out the al-Qaeda-ties case yet again, go to the Center for American Progress website. But, of course, on these ties, on WMD, on the effects of tax cuts, and on so many other subjects, you could go through this exercise of evidence and refutation until you were blue in the face and it might not matter at all. No matter what arguments are made, this administration just -- to use Lobe's word -- brazenly reasserts what, in any other context, would seem to be obvious lies.   Each stunning refutation by someone who was there -- David Kay on WMD; Terrorism Tsar Richard Clarke on the origins of the Iraq war, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill on the administration's pre-9/11 lack of interest in al-Qaeda -- and you think another lie has just crashed and burned. And yet, and yet…   In my just-launched series of unnoticed-resemblances between the Bush and Reagan eras, let me note that our former President pioneered this method of asserting the reality he chose and then insistently reasserting it against all evidence. His Strategic Defense Initiative, a supposed missile defense system against massive nuclear attack, was perhaps the classic example of this. It was always a "high frontier" corporate boondoggle. But when its critics, who knew perfectly well that it wouldn't fly, mockingly labeled it "Star Wars," the President simply absorbed the term, adding charmingly, "The force is with us." As the nation's top weapons scientists and experts at MIT and elsewhere shot down one Star-Wars plan after another, the system simply morphed into new forms and the President reasserted his "vision." And so it went. While Star Wars never made into the heavens, the moneys for versions of it flowed, and continue to flow, into corporate defense coffers. What Reagan showed was that this kind of a rope-a-dope response worked and it's still in use.   In fact, in extremely aggressive form, it's become the essence of this administration and has even recently gained pseudo-legal underpinnings. The legal memos on torture it sponsored essentially assert that reality is what the President, as commander-in-chief, insists it is, and neither Congress, nor the courts can interfere with his redefinition of reality as long as it happens in "wartime" -- itself not even declared by Congress but defined as such by the President. As with the constant reassertions of al-Qaeda/Saddam ties, this administration simply insistes that reality be made to conform to its needs and that it will broach no interlopers in the process.   This obviously goes far beyond the matter of lies (where so many in opposition to this administration are stuck). It is an assertion about the nature of reality: The world is what we say it is and language is no object. As with all ruling groups, self-indoctrination undoubtedly plays a powerful role here. These inside-the-Beltway warriors have surely convinced themselves of the truths that lie at the heart of their self-proclaimed "war on terror." It's likely that few of them believe themselves to be lying on essential matters (though they may be perfectly aware that aspects of what they are saying represent "necessary" or tactical lies).   Add in another factor here, foregrounded once again by the 9/11 Commission's recent staff report: As the World Trade Center was attacked, the President froze for seven excruciating on-camera minutes in a classroom at the Emma T. Booker elementary school in Florida. He continued to sit and listen to children read as events unfolded. (All seven minutes will be on view in Michael Moore's new film, Fahrenheit 9/11, scheduled to open next week.) The President and his advisers then panicked amid the chaos and sent his plane on a wild series of hops west rather than north.   Now, the fact is you never know how you'll react in a stressful situation. Anyone can freeze. But the President's reaction had to be personally humiliating. I've always believed that it gave a special oomph to all the macho play-acting that followed ("Dead or alive," "Mission accomplished," "Bring ‘em on!"). Much of it is, I suspect, compensatory. I'm willing to bet those seven minutes -- which in the long run won't be forgotten -- continue to gnaw at George W. Bush and helped drive him personally into his war "mission" and then beyond all bounds.   The 9/11 Commission chairmen have now requested from the vice president in particular "any intelligence reports that would support the White House's insistence that there was a close relationship between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda"; though Juan Cole comments, "Cheney as much as admitted that he gets his news on these things from the National Review, a rightwing magazine that is not known for having real experts on the Arab world, the sort who know Arabic and have lived there, on the staff."   However the administration tries to duck this one, one thing is certain: All refutations of administration positions will be followed by administration reiterations of one sort or another. There is no question that the Bush administration has shown itself willing to go far indeed to make reality conform to its needs and has until recently been remarkably successful in doing so. Even now, with the media floodgates finally opening at least part way, much that is being reported doesn't sink in. You would think, for instance, that a close relationship with the head of an organization which once set off car bombs in downtown Baghdad, a man whom we just elevated to prime minister of Iraq, might affect the reputation of a war-on-terror administration; but this revelation -- on the front-page of the New York Times, no less -- seems to have had no impact whatsoever.   Last week it was revealed that Donald Rumsfeld had ordered that an Iraqi prisoner held for months as a "ghost detainee," and this caused a modest media rumpus. This detention, however, is but a snowflake on the tip of our detention iceberg. Instead of single ghost detainees -- Human Rights Watch has identified at least 13 of these -- we have whole ghost interrogation centers. As Reuters reported this week: "The United States is holding terrorism suspects in more than two dozen detention centers worldwide and about half of these operate in total secrecy, said a human rights report released on Thursday." These detention centers range from Jordan to Pakistan, the island of Diego Garcia to aircraft carrier brigs. (The Human Rights First report, the most far-reaching account yet of our offshore mini-gulag, can be read by clicking here [warning: pdf file].)   So information is suddenly pouring out and the administration seems at the edge of imploding, but the question is: Will it make a difference or will the assertion of a different reality simply trump all else?   Let me end this disquisition with a fable from the fabulous pen of James Thurber. To my surprise, Thurber, though long dead, seems somehow to have channeled our moment. I've not seen this fable, which I recall from my childhood (and which appears in his 1940 book Fables of Our Time), quoted before in this context. It's entitled "The Birds and the Foxes" and reads in full:    "Once upon a time there was a bird sanctuary in which hundreds of Baltimore orioles lived together happily. The refuge consisted of a forest entirely surrounded by a high wire fence. When it was put up, a pack of foxes who lived nearby protested that it was an arbitrary and unnatural boundary. However, they did nothing about it at the time because they were interested in civilizing the geese and ducks on the neighboring farms. When all the geese and ducks had been civilized, and there was nothing left to eat, the foxes once more turned their attention to the bird sanctuary. Their leader announced that there had once been foxes in the sanctuary but that they had been driven out. He proclaimed that Baltimore orioles belonged in Baltimore. He said, furthermore, that the orioles in the sanctuary were a continuous menace to the peace in the world. The other animals cautioned the foxes not to disturb the birds in their sanctuary.   "So the foxes attacked the sanctuary one night and tore down the fence that surrounded it. The orioles rushed out and were instantly killed and eaten by the foxes.   "The next day the leader of the foxes, a fox from whom God was receiving daily guidance, got upon the rostrum and addressed the other foxes. His message was simple and sublime. ‘You see before you," he said, "another Lincoln. We have liberated all those birds!'   "Moral: Government of the orioles, by the foxes, and for the foxes, must perish from the earth."   Now, let me turn from the world-devastating and significant to the waist-expanding and insignificant. and offer a tiny reminder that this administration and its various supporters are bending reality at every level to meet their needs.   The battered French fry   In the run up to war in Iraq, when the French opposed us, or rather when the Bush administration left the French no leeway whatsoever to clamber aboard their moving armada of tanks and missiles, the lowly but beloved French fry (known "over there" as a pomme frite) took a pounding as well. While our tabloid press declared the French to be "weasels," or part of an "Axis of Weasels," and the New York Post infamously superimposed weasel heads on a photo of French and German UN diplomats, our congressional representatives bravely went nuts, exhibiting what passes for "patriotism" by renaming French fries, "freedom fries," in various of their cafeterias. "This action today is a small, but symbolic effort to show the strong displeasure of many on Capitol Hill with the actions of our so-called ally, France," Republican congressman Bob Ney of Ohio announced at the time. He was the chairman of the Committee on House Administration which held in trust the weighty burden of congressional fry oversight. (Never shirking the brave gesture, the White House gave the nod to the relabeling of French toast on the presidential plane, Air Force One. "Stuffed freedom toast" was, reported CNN, "a subtle slap at the French for helping to confound U.S. attempts to get the U.N. Security Council to authorize military force against Iraq… White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, asked about the newly titled ‘Freedom toast,' smiled and said, ‘We're always proud of the men and women of our Air Force.'" In congressional cafeterias, the humble fry is to this day shorn of its proud Gallic heritage and continues to be served under its nom de guerre.   Lately, our President, watching his Iraq policy drop off a cliff, has moved to patch up relations with France, inviting Jacques Chirac to drop by the "ranch" in Crawford, Texas someday to see his toy cows and then bantering with him at Sea Island during the G-8 conference about cheeseburgers. It seems, however, that our own Agriculture Department foresaw this moment. In 2000, unbeknownst to anyone but the French-fry lobby (yes, Virginia, there is a French-fry lobby), it began upgrading one species of that humble edible, the much-battered, frozen fry. In that year, as Andrew Martin of the Chicago Tribune explains:    "The Frozen Potato Products Institute appealed to the USDA… to change its definition of fresh produce under PACA to include batter-coated, frozen French fries, arguing that rolling potato slices in a starch coating, frying them and freezing them is the equivalent of waxing a cucumber or sweetening a strawberry. The USDA agreed and, on June 2, 2003, the agency amended its PACA rules to include what is described in court documents as the ‘Batter-Coating Rule.'"  PACA, by the way, was a law passed in the 1930s by Congress to protect fruit and vegetable farmers from being stiffed by deadbeat buyers. Recently, this hardly noticed Bush administration rule-change was challenged in a Texas court by a bankrupt frozen-fry company which didn't want to pay creditors in full (as would have been necessary if the battered frozen fry were truly a fresh vegetable). U.S. Department of Agriculture lawyers fought back manfully. "While plaintiff argued that battered-coated French fries are processed products," they claimed, "they have not been 'processed' to the point that they are no longer 'fresh'…It is still considered 'fresh' because it is not preserved. It retains its perishable quality."   And, this being Texas, the judge agreed, ruling that the already battered and freezing fry should go to its death as a fresh vegetable. "U.S. District Judge Richard Schell said the term ‘fresh vegetables' was ambiguous." In this, though he probably didn't know it, he was following an already well-beaten administration path. On rulings of far greater import, administration lawyers had privately advised the administration that words like "severe" or "profound" in definitions of torture were also ambiguous and so open to severe and profound redefinition in the service of the war-on-terrorism needs of top Bush officials.   As part of an attempted wholesale redefinition of reality, the modest redefinition of the frozen, battered fry isn't even on a par with administration attempts to reclassify "fast food employment as a manufacturing job," as first reported in the New York Times many months ago. (No offshore loss of manufacturing jobs under this administration, no sirree; just a lot of hardworking factory hands tossing previously frozen, heavily battered fresh vegetables for minimal wages at fast-food factories.)   As long as we've embarked on a path of redefining and renaming reality, and the courts are willing to back it up, I have a small suggestion for furthering the process and helping out an industry which certainly has at least as much to lose as the frozen-fry business and is far more deeply embedded in the Bush administration's Agriculture Department. What about reclassifying beef? After all, most cows, raised in huge feedlots, no longer eat grass. They are now essentially vessels for American-grown corn (making this suggestion especially patriotic). So, if you first reimagine a cow as a corn vessel, then beef too could be relabeled as a "fresh vegetable" (though some might say, based on the level of drugs feedlot cattle are given, that it's actually a "fresh chemical"). Imagine the advantages of this for the beef industry. The next time a case of mad-cow disease is discovered, it will have to be relabeled "mad vegetable disease," taking enormous pressure off the business and off the need to do any further or more thorough testing of cattle.   All of this is obviously possible since, as Judge Schell ruled, the term "fresh vegetables" is an ambiguous one. Of course, for cows meant for the high-end market that are grass-fed and allowed to wander, it certainly wouldn't be much of a stretch to create a new category (invented by a friend): free-range vegetables.   By the way, here's another of those little similarities between the Bush and Reagan eras. In Reagan's first term, that kindly man tried to reach out a helping redefinitional hand to schools that, as the Washington Post reported in September 1981, "provide free or reduced-price lunches to lower-income students as they try to deal with a $1 billion cut in federal support for the fiscal year." The modest answer then was, in part, to create a cheaper lunch package under federal nutritional guidelines by reclassifying ketchup and relish as vegetables. As an aide to Agriculture Secretary John Block summarized it at the time, "'There was a great misunderstanding in the land as to how these regulations are viewed. I think it would be a mistake to say that ketchup per se was classified as a vegetable . . . Ketchup in combination with other things was classified as a vegetable.' What other things? he was asked. ‘French fries or hamburgers,' he replied."   Plus ça change. The only difference being that the Reagan administration, when faced with recalcitrant reality, as in the case of ketchup, sometimes backed down. The Bush administration just reasserts its reality and calls on the lawyers for confirmation.

      As I.F. Stone used to say, "All governments lie," so that's no shockeroo. What's peculiar is the reaction in the media.   — You may recall that when even the administration finally admitted Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction (with that adorable video of President Bush on his hands and knees searching under sofas in the Oval Office for the missing WMD — oh, it was so amusing. Eight hundred American dead.), we were treated to the following rationales:   1) Didn't make any difference because Saddam Hussein was a really, really bad guy anyway.   He was, of course, and it was always the only decent rationale for getting rid of him. It was the argument made by Tony Blair but specifically rejected by the Bush administration. Paul Wolfowitz explained in Vanity Fair that human rights violations were not a sufficient consideration for invasion.   2) It was all Saddam's fault that we thought he had WMD. The wily coot fooled us by repeatedly denying that he had any, a fiendishly clever ploy.   3) He probably shipped them all to Syria just before we got there.   4) Get over it. We've heard enough from you people.   — Torture at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere?   1) No worse than fraternity hazing.   2) Just some low-level, white-trash morons.   3) We haven't tortured nearly as many people as Saddam Hussein.   4) Al Qaeda never signed no stinkin' Geneva Conventions, so we have a right to torture them.   5) Shut up, they explained.   — Torture was explicitly authorized at the highest levels of government.   1-5) See above, plus:   6) Did not.   7) So what?   8) "I'm going to say it one more time. The instructions went out to our people to adhere to the law. That ought to comfort you. We're a nation of laws. We adhere to laws. We have laws on the books. You might look at those laws, and that might comfort you."   Problem is the administration looked at the laws and decided to ignore them.   — Ahmad Chalabi is not just a liar, con man, thief and faker of intelligence, but also apparently a spy for Iran.   1) Chalabi? Ahmad who? Never heard of him.   2) We cut off all ties with Chalabi some time ago. (Last week.)   — The 9-11 Commission reports there is no evidence of collaboration between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, and in fact Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia were all much bigger players with Al Qaeda.   1) The 9-11 Commission didn't say that.   2) The media are overplaying the story and are also lazy and outrageous. (Never mind that it's the media's fault as much as the administration's that 69 percent of the American people were under the misimpression that Saddam Hussein was directly tied to 9-11.)   3) We never claimed he was behind 9-11. No, we never did — we may have implied it, we may have hinted, we may have suggested, insinuated, intimated, connoted, alluded to and said it between the lines, but we never said it, and you can't prove we did and we have no idea how the great majority of Americans ever got that silly idea in the first place. So stop reporting that it's not true.   4) We are tired of hearing from you people, this has been going on for almost 24 hours now and only Dead Reagan gets a week's worth of our undivided attention. Back to Kobe Bryant and Laci Peterson.   All in all, I'd say these folks have their act down now. Dick Cheney gets bonus points for Best Lying With a Straight Face.   On June 8, John Ashcroft was driven to the old Nixon defense — stonewalling. He not only refused to provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with Justice Department memos justifying torture, he refused to explain why he refused. The Washington Post then helpfully posted the memo on its website so we could all enjoy reading how our "Justice Department" explains why the president is above the law and above the Constitution, and does not need to observe any treaties.   Also, we learned it is not torture unless it is "equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impaired bodily function or even death."   Water torture (that's the one they politely refer to as "stressful conditions") was a particular favorite of the Gestapo against the French Resistance in World War II. Anal rape and shoving broken light bulbs up the rear end don't count at all.   I'm so glad George W. Bush has restored honor and integrity to the White House. And I appreciate all his defenders in the media more than I can say. They are truly distinguishing themselves as patriots in this hour of need.

      What is the definition of loyalty? How does one pick and choose those people with which one can interact? It seems, for me, that the more I think I know about those people that I surround myself with, and the more I seem to know myself, the less I truly grasp. In the long run, the consequences are dire, indeed.  As of this posting, at this exact moment, I am cutting all ties to a very LARGE chunk of people. Many of them will read this and become worried, or angry, or just plain confused. I simply do not give a fuck. I have been dealing with some treachery lately, of the online and offline variety, but both tied to the same few people. People I respected. People I felt were friends that I could rely on. People, that I let into my world, however limited or not that view may have been.  That door is now closed. That ship has now sailed onward. For those who have partaken in the little scheme (you know who the fuck you are), it has come to this only out of your misguided self-respect and grandiosity. I tried to warn you of the dangers inherent in your undertaking. You chose to spit it back at my face and mock me both publicly and in private. Reap what you sow, for I am no longer among your whipping boys.  I attempted to trust people who have turned that trust into something wicked. That wickedness has spread, and people seem to not realize that words can cause things worse than hurt feelings. They can, in some cases, get you killed - viciously.  No, this cryptic entry will NOT be explained. No, I couldn't give two less piles of dungbeetle carapaces what you think about that. No, none of this is will ever be "discussed" in IM or email or pm or posts. No, if you are not among the group of people I have shaved off my ass (socially,emotionally,literally), then you need not include yourself in this clusterfuck of posers,users,hangers-on and psychophants. Just know, if you cease to get responses from me, and you cease to see me around, then education should be commencing on where I stand with you.  Erasure to those that betray the trust I give them, for I am very loathe to give any to people in general.

      I watched the Ronald Regan send-off. I kept track of the faces. I watched the weather around those faces. I listened to all the spoken words and the emotional outpourings of those who knew the man and his dreams and life.  I am a child of the 80's AND the 90's. Being born in 1978, and exposed to the nuances of 80's popular culture (land of confusion etc), I was a product, culturally of both era's. I was too young to really be a PART of the Regan era in the same sense as those who came before me, but at the same time, I recall many nights spent hearing about his work in the world, and watching him on tv etc.  I grew into my own in the 90's. I witnessed the wall coming down in Berlin, but only insofar as a youngster, with then unknown ideals and uneducated world-view, can. I remember the Challenger, but it is not so palpable for me as perhaps it is for those a year or so older than myself.  One thing I took away from Ronald Regan, however, is rather morbid to some. But this isn't about them, so fuck it:  When you die, who do you want to stand atop your box and spout sonnets of your good deeds and man-helping-ness? Who do you want to say this or that, and what is it that you expect will be said?  Me? I don't give 2 shits about it. I expect to be forgotten, erased, deleted, name your negative cliche'. I just want to be left the fuck alone, with my own mystery surrounding what I may or may not have done, said, or what have you.

      I am continually amazed at the levels to which dumb-fuck is reached by a significant portion of the human species. Apparently, some idiot-fuck has gotten ahold of my now rarely-used yahoo email account (oh woe is me!) and has decided to send me trojans and worms at random, with classic subject fields such as: "urgent" and "for your perusal". Nevermind the fact that the sender field is filled in with an arabic-sounded moniker, to obviously assume the person getting the email is too stupid to check into such things, and that the person getting that email will assume a rag-head is sending them the mail. Brilliant!  Note to the idiot who is sending these, and undoubtably READ THIS (yes, you are sad): I do not open email with attachments, EVER. I do not read any email that comes to that account, EVER, and quite honestly, simply amuse myself with checking in on your stupidity, OFTEN...  :D

      I found this article online...I am amused by it...hhehheehehhehehehee....   News-Journal editorial   Last update: 04 June 2004     If there is any doubt that the Bush administration poses a greater threat to liberty as we know it than al-Qaida, Attorney General John Ashcroft dispels that doubt regularly. He defends warrantless searches, imprisonment without due process, secret tribunals and eavesdropping on defense lawyers. He end-runs state laws by federal edict. He scorns federal law by ordering his staff to comply as minimally as possible or not at all with such open-government tools as the Freedom of Information Act. He subordinates the Constitution to religious beliefs. And when challenged, he attacks his critics for brandishing "phantoms of lost liberties."  To critics of the USA Patriot Act, the administration's crowning smear of civil liberties and due process, Ashcroft said in 2001: "Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve. They give ammunition to America's enemies and pause to America's friends."  Yet if the aim of terrorists is to diminish liberty and deprave constitutional principles in the United States, no tactic has aided their goal so much as the regressive post-Sept. 11 laws dictated by the administration. No attack has given the terrorists so much ammunition, nor pause to America's friends, as the administration's policies within, and especially covert policies outside of, those laws. Terrorists have blown up buildings. The Bush administration is demolishing the rule of law.  The U.S. Supreme Court is about to hear arguments in several cases that sum up the administration's tactics in its so-called war on terror. One of those cases involves Jose Padilla, an alleged al-Qaida operative from Chicago who also spent several years in Florida. Padilla was arrested in Chicago in May 2002, declared an "enemy combatant" and has been imprisoned ever since, without charge, and until recently without access to a lawyer. Ashcroft claims that the government has the right to detain him indefinitely because he is an "enemy combatant." The tag is a pseudo-legal creation by the Bush administration that applies to suspected terrorists, and that keeps individuals outside the reach of either the Geneva Conventions, which regulate the treatment of prisoners of war, or the Constitution. The court will decide whether the "enemy combatant" tag is legally valid.  To buttress the administration's case, Ashcroft this week made public a stash of documents about the danger Padilla posed to the United States. For an attorney general so stingy with openness, the timing of the release is suspect. Ashcroft is obviously trying to manipulate public opinion, if not the court, with his alarmist evidence. But that's his prerogative. He's not doing anything editorial writers don't do every day. The difference is this: Ashcroft is only selectively releasing parts of the record. Secrecy doesn't breed credibility. Nor does selective openness. And what records he has released damage the administration's case that Padilla doesn't deserve due process.  The Justice Department's announcement of the declassified Padilla papers were geared at eliciting front-page coverage of Padilla's "dirty bomb" plot and scaring the public into line behind the government's tough tactics subsequent to his arrest. But there was no such plot. The declassified papers admit that if it was ever entertained, it was dismissed as unfeasible. At most, Padilla allegedly thought of blowing up apartment buildings by igniting gas leaks -- a plot as amateurish as it is implausible. So what's left? A scary story sexed up by the Justice Department to seem more than it was, an American citizen still in prison, without charges, and no way to know how the Justice Department got its information on Padilla. Torture, we now know, was a possibility.  That Padilla should have been arrested on criminal charges would probably not be in dispute even with weaker evidence. But he remains outside the boundaries of law, and the Justice Department remains unaccountable. That's the breakdown in due process every American should be worried about, the breakdown the court should halt and Congress should reverse.  "We need honest, reasoned debate, and not fear-mongering," Ashcroft said in his attacks on critics of anti-terror tactics. But the only way the administration has sustained its assault on liberties and the rule of law the past two years has been through fear-mongering. Honesty and reason might as well be enemy combatants.

        "I am darkness soaked in failure, my destiny, and so let it be. The ultimate failure is giving up and I am ready to succumb."     I have moments like this at least 2 times per day, but mostly at night...  Lately, I have felt as if my head is in a bowl of cold bleach. My eyes are also open, and I cannot scream, because the caustic chemicals are in my mouth, rubbing away my mucuous membrane. I am also on my knees, naked, in the sunsplit desert, seeing through burning away vision, someone driving towards me in a hummer at a high rate of speed. Do i pull my head out of the burning bowl to move? nah, fuck it...

      Hehe, I found this @ deadog.com  Three guys enter a disabled swimming contest.   The first has no arms.   The second no legs and the third has no body, just a head.   They all line up, the whistle blows and "splash" they're all in the pool.  The guy with no arms takes the lead instantly but the guy with no legs is closing fast.   The head of course sank straight to the bottom.  Ten lengths later and the guy with no legs finishes first.   He can still see bubbles coming from the bottom of the pool, so he decides he had better dive down to rescue him.  He picks up the head, swims back up to the surface and places the head at the side of the pool, where upon the head starts coughing and sputtering.  Eventually the head catches his breath and shouts, "Three years I've spent learning to swim with my fucking ears, then two minutes before the whistle, some asshole puts a swimming cap on me!"

      Something struck me at 8 this morning...  I have an idea of HOW and WHY and electronic voting system is being pushed on us all, despite the fact that so many are clamoring for a non-electronic or more highly regulated form of it: There are more than enough&nbsp;technologically retarded fools out there, to support the agenda of whomever wishes to abuse it. If you vote is cast and yet mysteriously is not counted, who the fuck will ever really know about it except the engineers and techs who man the machines and service their needs? It biggles the mind at the simplicity of this ploy, given the fact that the people being maligned in this manner are the very uneducated, uninformed people who would enable the mighty mighty bosses to do such a thing. Therefore, in the vent someone is elected (like dubya was) in that manner, you all get what you fucking deserve!

      Some of you may recall your history of Russia *grin*  Stalin began inserting his powerbase in the same manner as our modernly dubbed "homeland security", but he used a different name for it. Then one day, he began "deleting" people. What is the most surefire way to make people believe they need marshal law? Convince them they need protection. Cannot find an enemy? Fabricate one. The Romans did it. Bonaparte did it. Hell, it is the best thing since sliced bread to the tactically inclined.   Does this mean the "voting booth" will be fascist in nature? Well, that is if the current president even allows the election to go forward unsuspended. I believe a show is being made for us all, then wham, they will postone or even cancel them.  Was it not Senator Palpatine, from Star Wars mythology, who said: "I promise to return all authority granted me from these emergency powers, once the crisis has ended". But he never did, did he?

      3:09 a.m......  I am awake and in a great mood. I have recently rekindled my old relationship with electro-music.com (i had been absent for a long while, due to time and memory contstraints) and I am so inspired upon logging in again.  The guys over there are truly music pioneers in my opinion. I am so stoked to be a part of that online oasis for electronic music, that&nbsp;I feel a sort of hero worship for some of them (odd coming from me, i know).  When I spend time over there, I get a taste of the fact that, despite outsiders' view of a musician, we at times lead very lonely lives creatively, and are often dubbed as mavericks in some circles. I feel part of something that I can relate to as much as it relates to me as well. I feel...at home....  Pondering all this, i set out to work on the next album, with previously unreleased music, and more goodies ;)

Therefore, I have removed my master drive from the box, which means a fresh install of winXP onto the new 80 gb drive. this means I will be even later getting back to online things than I previously thought!    &nbsp;  I will have to data-transfer all of my settings, bookmarks, and whatnot, onto the new drive at a later date, once I have the special mounting bracket, so some of the sites that I frequent, unless on my links page at the site, will be unaccessible to me, because I do not have those URL's comitted to memory.

       What is the meaning of life?      This is cliche' to ask for some. For others, it is the catalyst by which dreams are fashioned, and passions are explained in earnest. Many view the meaning of life as a passing of events and nothing more. Many others feel the meaning of life is discovery and learning. Still many more subscribe to the notion that life has no meaning, and we meander through it like lemmings (grin).       For me, the meaning of life is creating things like music, poetry, and artwork, and in so doing, remind myself I am still here. There really is no other meaning for it all. I make shit to remind me of what I see, hear and feel. I make shit to describe those things. I simply do it...

      This is a humor rant. This is nothing serious at all. If you are offended by this, then you most likely are the subject of this rant. That is your only disclaimer from my mouth. So go away, or get a job...    I was on my way to the store.  It was an ordinary day, you know, the president lying through his assflaps again, and good ol american guys and gals eating dune coon lead in the hot son of "I-racked the evil santa twin in the balls".  I was entering the store, when ouf of the blue, a moron appeared to my left. I knew instinctively that this was a moron I was dealing with, whilst noting the fact that this man, who was about 30, was approaching in sandals, a flannel shirt (im in texas and it was 75 outside) and no socks or t-shirt under his other one. I immediately sensed cultist...   Boy was I wrong, like those fools at enron...   I am bombarded not by the sounds of proselytizing but instead "what kind of cologne do you wear?"      "I don't wear cologne, I am allergic to it, and my skin breaks out. Why?"   [he is incredulous]   "what? What kinda man doesn't wear cologne? How do you get pussy?"    STOP   For a moment I beheld the gaze of this man, dressed like a homeless, crack-addicted Kenny Loggins (and looking as much) and thinking to myself: "Here is an idiot with a global agenda. He is the very poster-child of NOT attracting a mate the best way possible, and yet is   a) trying to sell me a product most likely stolen that I don't need, want, or care about in any way...WHATSOEVER, and   b)he is giving me advice he won't, can't or has no intuition to follow.   UNPAUSE    "The normal natural way," I begin, "by engaging in the chase. By being romantic. Getting a college education. Making love to her, not making mincemeat out of her. You know, MAN stuff."   I proceeded to walk away and he GRABBED my arm. This is when the fun ended for me and I began to imagine his nearest vein being shut down.   Needless to say, the man was persistant. And in the end, I sold him a vicodin I had literally in my pocket because I found it one day whilst walking through the park. He gave me more for the vicodin than I would have for the fragrance.   Something tells me, to this moment, he thinks the vicodin sale was his idea

      Ice cream cures all...   Woman...What a word. It brings to mind, at least in my own fuckin noggin', images of Joan of Arc, Nancy FRAGGIN' Drew, and Mother Theresa. All in all, a miasma, an orgy, if you will, of "what the fuck" and also "oh how lovely". Woman...Damnation and yet salvation, in one set of pants (if applicable).   Women are everywhere. Sometimes where they are most needed. Sometimes where the do not belong. Women are understanding, as long as capitulation is hand in hand. Women are strong and intelligent, and often love pointing this out. Women have all the intuition we males tend to have spoonfed to us via small doses of kazaa, espn, or dear hunter version 900 billion. Women are the answer to questions many have asked, and are also questions many have yet to ask.   Why all the cryptic bullshit? Well kids, for all my 25 years of accumulated living experience, I know about as much about the female human genus as well, a walrus can program in C++ with his anus...not a lot. But I sure have fun attempting to scratch that itch!   In shorter terms, women are the most fascinatin insanity man can succumb to. Learn from them, ignore, or whatever it is you penis carrying johnny-5's do, but you cannot deny how interesting life is with all the little bambies running around in it!

      There was meaning. The door closed. There was singing. The window shut. There was calm. The shrieking commenced. There was placid quiet. The screaming wind ignited us aflame. There was hope. There is now ichor. There was something to believe in. Now, there is nothing.  I am so far gone in my head that I am unsure I will ever fully get it right. No, this is NOT a mental health issue. It is a closure on some emotional bags that are so heavy..well, to ignore them is to survive them. Today was quite possibly the most horrible day I can recall, even worse than my last blog entry in a similar state. Today, it all fell away. The post below this one, was years in the making, with a cast of thousands, and one ending, unforseen, but knownst to me all the while: I am nothing to you and had to see it like this to get the color just right. Poems express only so much, then the silence kicks in. Let there be that silence now, then. I close the notebook, and lay down my pen. I am done writing.

      I am told I have too large an ego. Often-times, I have been witnessed attacking other people for having the same personality trait. Apparently, in my zeal to crucify those who believe themselves better than anyone else, I perhaps have stumbled into that pattern of thinking/behaving. This alarms me. This alarms me due to the fact that I am also known for owning up to my mistakes, and I apparently am not following that creed now am I? I took it coming to this for me to see, that in my quest to be right about things, I have sunk beneath the scum I resent so well.  Oh well, sue me. The first step in overcoming this shortsighted fuckup of my creation, is of course, not doing it any longer. Therefore, from here on out, unless I am certain on a particular course of action, regarding verbal slaughter of some nimrod with a mouth the size of Rhode Island, I will think through my reaction more clearly, and pick my battles accordingly. The most foolish thing one can do for themselves is NOT LEARN from a mistake. I am no fool ;)

      Many faces in the traffic around me. I thought about this most of the drive home. Pondering people always leads to pondering why and how etc. I often-times sense that I am wasting mental bandwidth on the commonalities of mankind, but I digress. It is those unspoken thoughts which feed my intellect and keep me going.  I feel at peace this afternoon, largely in part to my intervention last evening (smile). I have a reason to smile today, and it has more to do with reality than I would once have wished to admit. I long to be this way more often. In fact, lately, it has beem so. Thankful? You bet your American ass I am!  Music is becoming more of an outlet for me. I feel that my music is becoming....more complex and less goofy. I truly made some kickass stuff last evening. I suppose it had to do partly with the emotions that July 4 always invokes within me. Not pride to be here in this country, but the realization I can do and think what I wish without fear of an AK. Perhaps that is unspoken and unrealized pride, then. So be it...

      I found the elftown member house of a dude named "Capt.Sodomiser". His name and his attitude and his comments and posted pics indicate that he needs to BE sodomized by the swift hand of a mob...here is the picture he has in his house, and why he needs to be shot in the back of the head with a potato gun...    urlLink idiot.jpg   People like this make me want to purge the human gene pool permanently from the earth...stupid!

      I sat and watched the sun fade into his little pocket of coma. I listened to the damn locusts as their heated chorus dried up. I smelled the stench of the city dump. I forgot why I am here.  I have reached an emotional crossroads tonight. Something has shattered within. It is not so much a negative thing, as a connundrum from which I can cull no definitive answers. I feel...nothing. I am not unhappy. I am not angry. i am not sad or depressive. I simply...do not feel. I have had this happen to me this strongly only one other time in my life, and when it did, I survived a major life-altering situation because I had this...nothing..to hold onto.  Something within me has snapped. I cannot reach far enough into myself to unglue this sticky scenario from my bones, and it is really beginning to frighten me. I have no desire to save the world. I have no want or need of the company of others to feel I matter or belong. My heart is beating empty notes into a blank cassette tape of life. Something is wrong...VERY WRONG.  I used to be so...motivated by my artistic work, and the people in my life who showed a promising smile and encouraging words. I used to believe in the basic good of mankind. I used to see the sun and think how marvelous a gift it was.  Now, I just sorta sit and wonder why it all is here at all. I do not hate the world, I simply wonder at the point to everything. Not in a "i need to kill myself" mentality, but rather, a "this is all a blank slate of gray". Clinical students would think I am depressed, but it is not depression or somberness that is plaguing me. I feel...LETHAL. I feel overtly powerful, a bravado from which springs forth a wellspring of callousness, coldness, and a lack of remorse.  I have been through much. I have not however, had it any worse than the next guy. I am amazed how people react to similar things: Some die. Some kill. Some drink. Some Snort. Some find God...I, well, I find this inner demonic personal strength and fortitude. I will not give up my ideas to anyone, no matter who they are. I will not give in to my inner child. I will not allow anyone to abuse me or use me. And yet, I am nothing if no a constant bit-rate of mental overkill, so to speak. Something inside has had to give for a long, long time now. And it has...
