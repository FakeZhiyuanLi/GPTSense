      &nbsp;&nbsp;Hi I am Tannie. So lets get it going on here.....okay? whats up? Well there's alot happening&nbsp;in my life, I am just getting ready to quit smoking ciggarrette's .It's hell because I am actually having&nbsp; withdrawels.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't smoke I suggest that you never do,(but besides that you may not know the power of being addicted to anything)....And I pray that if you do smoke that &nbsp;God will deliver you before any real damage is done.Oh there are other carcinogenics in our world but ciggarette smoking has always got the "short end of the stick" Get it? stick?well I love smoking just about as much as I do eating ...&nbsp;and I am not going cold turkey but I tell you this much I will be a non- smoker in less than three months. I am not using a patch, or gum, or nasal injections, this is without&nbsp; artificial help, I am using only whats available.Cigs.&nbsp;Gradually decreasing the amount that I smoke allowing room for errors and relaps if need be.But I intend to quit and every opportunity that I can&nbsp; reject a ciggarette.. I will .&nbsp; By distracting myself from the ciggarette. The sensations(withdrawels) only last 5-15 minutes then&nbsp; it recycles and comes back around more or less stronger depending how much you have smoked. My Parents smoked.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ciggarettes are very funny plant I mean bizzare.Funny the nicotene was used by the plant to&nbsp;discourage&nbsp; critters and bugs and animals away from the plant . So it is with all alkaloids.Bitters. Caffiene and heroine and lots of other products have alkaloids. Those product seem to be enticing enough and yet bitter.. I'll let you know how it is going.and if I won the battle with ciggarrette. Yes some have said why not cold turkey? Yes, lets leave the cold turkey to the other alkalilike families. You can learn so much from an Encyclopedia, you'de be amazed.&nbsp;  P.s. If this is crude please comment. But I need all the support I can get.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  P.P.S. I started my project on July the 12th-till the 27th of september 2004&nbsp;when my Dr.order me oxygen for sleep at night due to&nbsp; possible heart problems.Oh I don't need to mention I am only 39.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Take care ofYour Friends..... &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tannie
