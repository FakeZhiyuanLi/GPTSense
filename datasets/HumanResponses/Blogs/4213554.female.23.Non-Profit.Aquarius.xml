      Some halachas just aren't fair.  David & I had a wonderful Shabbat.  Saturday, we even walked to Millenium Park with Andrew, Julie, Neer, Simona & a few others.  It was a beautiful day.  Once we got back...a few hours later, everyone felt a sense of accomplishment.  Saturday night, we watched Vertigo with some friends at our place.  I'm not sure if I liked the movie.  It is definitely a classic & kept my attention, but the plot was a bit weird.  I guess that goes with most Hitchcock movies.  We were up so late Saturday night, I almost didn't get up Sunday morning.  Thanks to David, I woke up just in time to take a quick shower and go to Ali & Ben Rosenthal's baby's bris.  I'm really happy I went, even though I could have used the extra sleep.  The baby is precious....Gavriel Shalom. It was really fun to see some new & old faces...lots of catching up.  After the bris, David and I drove to Lake Geneva for the afternoon.  I wasn't too impressed.  Who ever heard of paying to go to the beach?  Even on the most beautiful beaches in California or Cape Cod, you don't have to pay.  Lake Geneva...an ok beach...not the greatest charges $7 to sit on the sand and take a swim.  We didn't go to the beach.  Instead we just walked around the town...its cute, but nothing too exciting.  After two hours, we drove back to Chicago.  We made one stop at Winnetka Park (on Lake Michigan) & had a small bbq with my mom &amp; step-father.   It got soo cold that evening, but at least we had quality family time.    I saw some family & friends this weekend.  Overall, I had a good weekend.  What happened? why are some halachas not fair?  I won't go into detail, but I just don't like it when everything is ok, then something happens to make me separate again for another few days.  This month is just so frustrating for me.   Besides a little halachic issue that hopefully will be resolved soon, I can't complain.  No more jealousy.  My brother is home from Israel.  He had an amazing time on birthright.  I'm a bit annoyed that he didn't stay for my cousin's wedding.  He said he'll go back soon.  I hope going to Israel helped give him more of a connection to Judaism.  He needs to spiritually grow.  Tonight David and I are going to the Outdoor Movie at Grant Park.  The summer is almost over.   I guess we have to take advantage of the last days of summer in the city.

      I've been blessed the past few weeks with so many things, except one - the green monster of jealousy. Thank G-d my mom's CAT scan shows no more cancer. She is almost recovered from her surgery. Its such a miracle. She is doing wonderfully. In a few weeks, she'll even get to go back to work. I just started at job at Torah Learning Center of Northbrook as Program Coordinator...so far so good. My husband, David is wonderful. We carpool to work every morning. I hate waking up in the morning to drive the north suburbs. Its such a shlep. It gives us time to catch up though. My brother is in Israel..finally on Birthright! I'm so happy he's having an outstanding time and might even be staying for my cousin, Andy's wedding. I'm so happy that my cousin is getting married to a wonderful gal from Queens. May they build a bayit neeman Yisael in Israel where they reside. The wedding is in Israel. My brother is in Israel. A lot of my family & friends are in Israel. Do you know where this is going? I'm not in Israel &amp; thats why I'm soo jealous of everyone who is. Everyday I stare at my brother's itinerary for birthright and wish that I was on top of Masada, in the Dead Sea, davening at the kotel, dancing on Ben Yehuda St, on and on and on. I was in Israel 5 years ago and said I would go back in 6 months and I haven't been back yet. Right now, plane tickets are $1200 in August (peak season), David & I just simply can't swing it now. This jealousy has got me, yet I'm sooooo incredibly happy for everyone and wish I could share in such a wonderful simcha. Mazel tov Andy &amp; Nili!!!
