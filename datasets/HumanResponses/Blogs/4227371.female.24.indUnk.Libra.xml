       i dropped a raisin on the ground, and i couldn't find it.  it's like it disappeared into the crazy patterned carpet vortex under my cube....   but i did find a dried cranberry, aka "craisin" (who comes up with this stuff?).  it looked like it was there for a while though, cause it was all mashed into the carpet like i ran over it with my chair a bazillion times.  of course i started picking at it, but it wouldn't come out.  it was gross, but kinda cool.     i have weird things in my cube....

       the past few days have been very ho hum blah blah.... OH - but i DID see an accident happen right in front of me yesterday morning.... i guess that qualifies as something. so here's a short story on my brief adventure:     as i was going going about my merry way to work, singing along w/ avril, i heard a huge metal on metal *thud*. i looked up and saw papers flying up in the air. for a second it looked like a big water fountain in the middle of 237, spewing out someone's thesis. after slamming my brakes, i sat in amazement as i saw a little green civic fishtail and spin its way towards my lane, and an old honky truck swerving all over the highway w/ it's hood crumpled up like a piece of foil. when the noise settled and the screeching stopped, what lay directly in front of me was a car facing forward, and another car in front of him facing the center divide. all i could remember as she screeched to a halt was dead silence (for a few seconds) her head jerking forward and back and forward again like a bobble head, and white paper falling to the ground like snow. it was pretty crazy. the first thoughts running through my head were: "is she ok? is there BLOOD? should i get out and help her? thank GAWD i traded in my civic..." how terrible is THAT?! in the midst of an accident, i was thinking of my car. jeeez, i hope i don't burn in hell for that one. well, thank goodness she turned out to be ok, and there were about 3 guys who stopped and started running towards her so i felt ok leaving. after driving around the broken bottles, binders, a shoe (she had a TON of crap in her trunk) and stupid onlookers who effing stopped and started CREATING TRAFFIC - you BASTARDS - i continued on my morning drive and played 'guess the celebrity' along w/ sarah and no name on alice radio.      I guess the lessons learned here is: 1. drive carefully damnit 2. don't put piles of paper in your trunk 3. minnie driver dated 3 of her leading men 4. be thankful that you don't drive a little civic. and if you do, consider trading it in.

       my hands STINK from cutting an ass load of garlic yesterday. grossness.... i've washed my hands a million times, w/ 5 different soaps. how do you get this stank ass smell off??!?!? anyone?!?! please advise!!! i had my "i'm a little boy inside" fill for the month. okay, maybe a few weeks... took my 3 favorite toys out this weekend - my truck, bike, and atv. drove 3.5 hrs to meet the whole clan for a family shindig at my cousin's place in lincoln (NE of sac, right next to a little town called the middle of NOWHERE). woohoo!!! i had so much fun. just makes me really really miss hanging out w/ my pops and bro doing guy stuff like that.... just us, 2 atv's, a dirtbike and an open lot behind target, where stupid costco and other crap now sits. sometimes i just feel like yelling: "EFF YOU CIVILIZATION!!! you keep taking all the good spots for 4wheeling!!! DIRT HOGS!" now, there's nowhere around vallejo to take our toys out to "gather dust". well, nowhere illegal anyway. those are the best spots. no, seriously. right before they build houses, there's all those hills and mounds of dirt.... sooooooooo fun...... aaaaah, memories. now my baby's back in the city - the dirtiest car in the whole parking lot. i could't be more proud... (sniff sniff) and i've finally decided on a name for my truck - "beast". definitely a boy car. most definitely.

        I said goodbye to my food today.    yeah, i did. really.  don't you hate it when you're eating out and you have just a little bit left? you're too full to finish those last few bites... but it's too small for a doggie bag cause you'll feel stupid packing 3 pieces of chicken and a couple spoonfulls of pasta? doesn't it feel like a waste? don't you hear starving people sitting in your plate saying "eat me, you WASTER OF FOOD"? well, i do. damn that philanthropist in me. so i said goodbye to my chicken and something alfredo as i was leaving the table today. i just felt bad leaving it behind.
