      So, tonight I sit down for  Eastenders  to witness the return after 15 year of Den Watts. I know we saw him yesterday, but that was for about 5 seconds and all we heard from him was "'Ello, Princess". THIS was the return, THIS would be the night we here how he escaped the killer daffodils, THIS would be the night where the true King Of The Square would return to his rightful throne. So, I sit down, listen to the theme, see the man and...   BBC F'N 1 DISAPPEARS!!!!!!!!   Bastards, bastards, bastards!  NB. The comments board has disappeared for a bit while urgent updates are being done. Be patient.

          Lilo & Stitch  Well,  I finally got around to what some have called the funniest Disney movie ever made. It may well live up to that claim, but it also has a sweetness to rival many of the classics.   Lilo & Stitch  is the story of an genetically created alien killing machine who escapes to the planet Earth, a galactic nature reserve for the preservation of mosquitos. While on Earth, the alien poses as a dog, befriending a orphan girl, Lilo, who may be taken into care away from her older sister if they cannot prove they can exist as a family.  As far as Disney films go, this is up there with the likes of Aladdin and The Lion King. The humour ranges from the standard slapstick to the utterly surreal (Stitch's construction and destruction of "San Francisco" is a highlight). However, it is the ability of the story to pluck at the heartstrings that lifts this to a classic status. The struggle of two outsiders to find their place is the world is done to stunning effect.  There are flaws in the plot, such as the changing attitude of Stitch's creator towards the conclusion, but as a great bit of escapist fun,   Lilo & Stitch  is a winner.   4/5

      Well, since I've got this working, here's a meandering bit of writing. *Ahem*...  As a fan of his work, I am excited about Christian Bale as the next Batman, especially with Chris 'Memento' Nolan behind the camera. However, back in 1946, a potentially even greater version of the Dark Knight was being considered   urlLink According to this site,  Orson Welles, famous actor and director, known for his many films such as  Citizen Kane  and  Transformers: The Movie  was prepared to produce a Batman film. The casting of the villians is truly wonderful (and the best part - most of the actors had accpeted): George Raft as Two-Face , Basil Rathbone as The Joker, James F'in Cagney as The Riddler  and Marlene Dietrich as Catwoman! Unfortunately, studio differences over the casting of Gregory Peck as Batman meant the film fell through. And it is a damned shame, because a Batman film at the being of the mythology, without additions like Robin and Bat-girl and without the influence of Adam West and Burt Ward running around in camp leotards would have been awesome.

      Hello. Welcome to my new page. It may be a basic template from the good people at Blogger.com, but it is sufficient for my needs.  So, just a couple of answers to a couple of questions:   Why have you got a blog?  Well, basically, I send a lot of e-mails to my friends. Some of them get replies, a lot of them get ignored. F*ckers. Anyway, so that I am not clogging up peoples inbox's, I thought I would post my ramblings on the world wide web instead, so people can just come here when they want to know about stuff I'm doing.   What insights will I gain from reading the postings on the blog?  Not much really. You'll find I am an idle sod who hates his job.  That's it really. They'll probably be sod all on for a bit. But once I get some web hosting, it will look prettier.

       urlLink Jim Caviezel, playing Jesus in Mel Gibson's  The Passion  is struck by lightening.  The assistant director was also hit, making it the second time during the filming.  Well, since Jewish groups are pissed of at the film, and they believe in the Old Testament God, who tends to punish those who have been naughty more that New Testament God, surely it cannot be a good sign for Mel that He may be trying to stop the film being made. Or, it could just be that the assistant director is a really tall bloke, and he happened to observe a couple of times that he was 'bigger than Jesus'.

       London Eating Review for Oxo Tower    When my boyfriend told me he wanted to take me up the Oxo Tower for my birthday, I was a bit hesitant at first because I didn't really think it was my scene. How wrong I was! I mean, yeah, so it's a bit of a strain on the old back pocket, and I admit I did feel a bit uncomfortable initially. But a couple of cocktails helped me relax and soon I was really getting into it - we carried on well into the night. It was a great experience and I really loved it - so much so that I won't let my boyfriend take me anywhere else now! So if anyone ever wants to take you up the Oxo Tower, just throw caution to the wind and go for it!

          Kill Bill  Do you remember before Matrix Reloaded came out, we heard rumours of the 100 Smiths fight? Then we heard from the producer, Joel Silver, about how scenes like the 'burly brawl' would redefine they way that people made films. So, like the good sheep we are, we all went down to the cinema, the hype doing its job and packing us in. Smith appears, bit of gabbing and then... Neo hitting a bunch of fake looking blokes. Followed by a fake looking Neo hitting a bunch of fake looking blokes. And then, after 5 minutes on repeat, Neo flies off. Ho hum.  That is one off the funniest things about Kill Bill. Quentin Tarantino, wonder-brat director, has, with the House of Blue Leaves scene, on a much smaller budget and without state-of-the-art CGI, made the Walchowski's look very silly.  Tarantino's previous three films, while they have been decried as bloody and violent, have actually had a surprising lack of 'action' - sure, we have a car crash, decapitations by both katana and gun and a shoot out in Pulp Fiction, but there has never been a real 'fight scene', instead relying on the dialogue and the character's reaction to the situations drive the films. As a first attempt to become an action director in the style of, say, John Woo, Kill Bill sacrifices these characteristics to become a balls-out revenge movie.  The plot centres on The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, a character created by Thurman and Tarantino during a conversation on the set of Pulp Fiction (Hmm, wonder how that conversation went. "Quentin, in a future film, would it be great if I played this woman who was getting married...","...and then gets left for dead in a motherfucker of a shootout in the church, at which point she becomes an ice-cold bitch bent on revenge! Nice idea, Uma"). A former assassin who is left for dead in an attack on her wedding day by her boss and former colleagues, The Bride wakes up from a coma four years later, intent on revenge for the death of her husband and unborn child. The film catalogues, in chapters, the attempts of The Bride to take out the former members of the hit squad. In Vol. 1, we have the story of her recovery from a coma and her meetings with two of her attackers.   Each opponent of The Bride's takes the story into different genres that inspired Tarantino's film career. For Copperhead, we are taken into 70's exploitation films, with a sassy black woman facing off in a fight with knifes. Incorporated into this, is the usual QT black humour, with Copperhead's daughter turning up half way through the fight, then being told to go to her room while her mother and 'old friend' catch up. However, it is the story of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) where Quentin shows his flair for action.  The story of O-Ren Ishii has many influences shining through. We have an anime history of O-Ren, a samurai style tale as The Bride tries to obtain a sword from a retired master and a Bruce Lee style 'one vs. many' fight in The House of Blue Leaves. The House of Blue Leaves is just a stunning half hour of action. We have The Bride taking on the Army of 88, a schoolgirl assassin named Go-Go (a treat for Battle Royale fans like myself) and a final confrontation with O-Ren. Again, we see more black humour, with the telling off of a school age assassin and the reaction of the club owner to seeing the carnage on her dance floor.  One area where the film suffers may be from the splitting of the film into Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. While the character of O-Ren Ishii is developed brilliantly, we know little of the Bride's back-story (Why did she quit the squad? Who was the husband?) apart from 'wanting revenge'. There is also little of the memorable dialogue that sad bastards can quote to each other that we usually get from Tarantino.  Be warned that this is an incredibly violent film. With various body parts removed on characters throughout the film, gushing arteries and a disembowelment by a schoolgirl, this will not to be everyone's taste. However, if you are a fan of good, solid action and a taste for black humour, you will not do any better than watching this. While it may not be a masterpiece, it is still one of the best films of the year and I look forward to Vol 2. a lot more that I am looking forward to Revolutions.    5/5    Note: If I finally get around to reviewing Nemo, it means I have only reviewed great movies so far. This tends to be because I try to avoid crap and only watch what I think I'll like. This is obviously no good, so I need suggestions from you for bad films I can review. And Inno, lend me Tomb Raider.

      *Saturday saw the Leeds vs Scum match, which we lost 1-0. To be fair, we didn't play too bad until the last 15 minutes and Manyoo didn't look that great for a lot of the match.  Funniest part of the afternoon is a toss-up between the Little Braided Bitch getting booked for 'simulation' when it looked like Gary Kelly had clearly brought him down twice and Roy Keane and O'Shea arguing for ten minutes on who was at fault for Keane not reaching a pass from his countryman.  Leeds could be in trouble by the end of the next two weeks. With Liverpool, Arsenal, Manyoo again and Chelsea coming up, Leeds could be out of a cup competition and rooted to the bottom of the league. Mixed with the likeliness that we will have a record loss for the past year, taking our debt to £100M, it isn't looking too good.  *Saw Kill Bill yesterday, which is a thoroughly enjoyable film. TFMrs A-MOL came along, which is quite surprising as she isn't usually interested in films which are described as bloody and violent. Her only problem in the end is that the viloence was too cartoony. Tsk, women. Review coming soon (and maybe a Nemo one).  *So Paul Burrell must be skint. "Diana's rock" has decided to wait 6 years to announce that he had a letter from Di saying that she felt there was a plot to kill her in a car crash. Now, instead of announcing this, say, when Diana died in a car crash, he waited until his autobiography was due out to come up with this. You really must have her interests at heart, Paul. This really is becoming a conspiracy that refuses to die, like the JFK one.  I mean, come on, it was a high speed car accident that occurred when the driver was breaking the speed limit in a tight tunnel. Accidents like it happens everyday. Just get over it.

        So, Sunday was the first time I have seen the WWE live. In the past years, these events tended to sell out in minutes. However, with a lot of stars retiring and the failure to find anyone to fill their spaces, the WWE is not a popular as it was before with those who wanted to see The Rock and Steve Austin. By also splitting the rosters in two, fans are not going to see the full collection of wrestlers in the WWE's employment, so the pulling power for the shows is, again, reduced. While the Smackdown half does not have some of the big names I would have liked to see (Chris Jericho, Christian and the unmasked Kane), pretty much all of my favourite wrestlers would be there, so for £20 a ticket, TFMrs. A-MOL and I went off to the MEN Arena.  Now, as a wrestling fan, I do need to make a point. Yes, I know it is 'fake', and the results are predetermined. It is not as 'fake' as some would have you believe, which is why every few years, you hear the story of someone trying to sue Vince McMahon because little Jeb, after his father has told him "It's fake, son", can no longer walk after asking his friend to piledrive him through a burning table.  So, we sit down after buying a 'Cheat 2 Win' Los Guerreros shirt and a programme. The seats we get are at the very top of the MEN, which gives us a great view of the whole proceedings, but I would have liked to be a little closer to the action.  Before the matches start, we get the full legal mumbo-jumbo about the use of photography etc. for commercial purposes from ring announcer, Tony Chimel, and I fully appreciate the work of a ring announcer from this. The way they roll the syllables and emphasise certain words makes anything sound exciting. "In the eeeeevent of a CAN-celllllation, pur-lease RE-tain your ticket for a RE-ffffffffund". Marvelous. And away we go.   Chris Benoit vs. Albert  Pretty great reaction for Benoit, as it should be, but it may have just been the "Hey! We know him!" reaction the first person out traditionally gets. A-Train comes out and the fully hairiness of the man becomes apparent even from the top of the arena. I mean, damn. I am pretty hirsute myself, but this guy makes me look like Duncan Goodhew after a back, sack and crack wax.   As the match gets underway, the Public Announce System gives an 'Emergency Broadcast' for 2 minutes, consisting of an alarm and a voice asking us to evacuate the arena. It has become apparent to me that one day, there will be a tragic event when a fire or bomb takes out a large gathering of people due to the fact that when an alarm goes off, people just look around confused and say, "I ain't moving. I paid twenty quid for this seat and I'll be buggered if I'm going to lose it."  After, the match gets underway and it is pretty disappointing for a Benoit match, because, quite frankly, A-Train is awful. We get the signature moves from Benoit (Rolling German Suplexes, Diving Head butt) and a swank Cradle Superplex from A-Train before A-Train gets a De-Railer, which Benoit kicks out of at two. I am pleased to see that the UK audience has adopted the Canadian policy of shooting "TWOOOOOOOOO!" when someone gets a 2-count. A-Train gets pissed off, grabs a chair and runs at Benoit, who avoids the swing and locks in a Crippler Crossface for the tap-out.   Nunzio + Tajiri vs. Ultimo Dragon + Rey Mysterio Jr.  Hell, yeah! I like all these guys, and apparently, so does Manchester. Even the evil Italian and the evil Japanese bloke get a good cheer, though nothing like the pop for Rey's entrance. Pretty good 'Dragon' chant throughout the match, which is pretty surprising considering he hasn't been pushed on TV. Maybe the bookers will take the hint. HA HA! Right. That would get in the way of A-Train and Orlando Jordan pushes and reduce TV time for Stephanie McMahon. (Ooh! Smarky!)  The match revolves around Rey setting up the 619 but being blocked by the shenanigans of Tajiri and Nunzio. We get some pretty good looking Cruiserweight spots throughout this, including a darn good tope from Ultimo Dragon and a Tarantula/Dropkick combo on Rey, before a double 619 and Rey's "Dropping The Dime" on the back of the neck gets the pin.   Funaki + Billy Kidman vs. The Self Proclaimed World’s Greatest Tag Team  BOOYAH! Shelton Benjamin in the Hizzouse! I thought he was injured so didn’t expect him to be on the card. TSPWGGTT get a face pop as well. Pretty boring match actually, though there was some damned fine double-teaming by Benjamin and Haas. I think there was a cock up at the end, or this may be the first time in 6 years that someone has lost on a reversed sunset flip, as Funaki did.   Rhyno vs. “Jamie “By God” Noble, The Redneck Messiah” w/ Nidia  That was the full introduction for Noble by Chimel. Quality. Rhyno gets a face pop, so to make sure we don’t cheer him but get behind Noble, he informs us that “England can kiss his ass”. Thank you, Rhyno. He gets an ECW chant from about 4 people (No wonder they went bust), which bemused me because they was none in the first tag match where at least three (maybe even four) of the wrestlers were in ECW as well. Pretty good match, where Noble and Nidia worked well to get the crowd on their side. The basic story was Noble trying to wear down Rhyno, who could kill him with power moves. We even saw a Gore on Rhyno by Noble, before Rhyno got his own for the win. I was disturbed by an eight year old in front of me, who found Nidia being thrown violently from the apron the funniest occurrence of the night.    Tag Team Titles The Bashams vs. Los Guerreros   Eddy is ridiculously over. An ‘Eddy’ chant starts up the moment the match is announced. Nice touch by Eddy to start a ‘Chavo’ chant for his nephew. I haven’t seen that much of the Bashams, but I thought they did their job really well, winding up the crowd with some traditional heel antics. Eddy and Chavo both did their ‘in peril’ bits until the started CHEATING 2 WIN~! After the old “Throw the belt to the opponent and pretend he has attacked you” bit from Eddy, the ring was cleared allowing Eddy to hit his frog splash for the pin. Great match. Big Show attacked Eddy at the end, setting up the stuff for later.   Matt Hardy V1 vs. The Big Show  Hmmm, I was convinced Matt was meant to be a bad guy, but he gets quite the cheer and most of the crowd flashing the V1 hand signal. There was a little girl, about six years old, wearing a “Cheat 2 Win” T-shirt and flashing the signal. It warmed my heart, it did. If her family where killed in some kind of fiery accident, I would happily raise her as my own. This was a basic comedy match, with Matt pretending he had the strength to hold his own with the big bastard. It has to be said, when JR say “Bah God, you have to see The Big Show in person to appreciate his size”, it is kinda true. The match must have gone about 5 minutes before Eddy ran in to cause a DQ. This resulted in Rhyno and A-Train running in to help The Big Show and Benoit, Chavo and Rey running in to back up Eddy and Matt. After clearing the ring, the good guys generally just fucked about with the crowd for a laugh.   Bikini Contest.  Oh f*cking hell. So pointless. Sable, Nidia, Dawn Marie and Torrie F’in Wilson some out, drop their robes to see skimpy outfit. Fall out over decision, light bondage for ref when he tries to separate them. The only interesting thing was Nidia getting a reaction pretty close to Torrie Wilson’s. That would have pissed people off if the crowd had voted a different way to that which the WWE expected.   Main Event John Cena and Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle and The Undertaker  John Cena comes out to a mixture of cheers, boos and a ‘Cena’ chant. He raps that this show the English are crazy. “You guys are off your rocker/ Think you play football, but it’s pansy ass soccer”. Heh. Big boos for that line. He then declares that we are “…insane/ No wonder Beckham left Man U for Spain”. Ha! That line gets cheered, because, of course, there are no Man U fans in Manchester. “I had a good laugh watching the game against Turkey/ He missed the penalty cos he hates this freaking country”. Heh heh. “You English people make me sick/ You smoke fags and eat Spotted Dick?”. HA HA HA! Cena rules all.  Lesnar comes out to a huge cheer, which quickly turns into a “You Tapped Out Chant”, referencing his loss to Kurt Angle. Lesnar responds be showing his belt. Angle and Taker come out to HUGE cheers. We then get a five minute stalling session, including Taker’s Lesnar impression (Kurt put him in the ankle lock, and Taker starts crying and “taps out”) and Lesnar threatening various members of the crowd (“If the guy with the hooter blows it again, I’ll come up there and shove it up his ass!”). The match gets going and it is pretty much a standard Lesnar/Angle match, with Cena and Taker coming in for the odd bit of punching and stuff. Everyone hits their finisher, including a NICE F-U on Taker by John Cena, before Taker gets the pin after a Last Ride on Lesnar.   Afterwards, we get a bit of chatter between Taker and Angle, which results in Angle flashing his pasty white arse. Ugh.  Damned good show by the WWE. I quite like this style of show, with no ‘storylines’ and such, just wrestlers putting on a fun show with a lot of crowd participation.

         Quite a busy weekend after being sent down to Hemel Hempstead at the last minute at work, which would have been okay if the machine I was meant to be testing on worked in the first place.   *Dear Gary Neville, I support you in your strike action. If you believe in something so much that you would rather stay at home than play in important football matches, please do so. And try and get your brother involved.  What would you do if something of actual importance happened, instead of your mate forgetting to take a piss? I suggest a ritual disembowelling performed on Sky Sports, with Playercam focussed on you and analysis by Andy Gray.  *Sunday was a pretty packed day, so I have two write ups that should be on the site within the next two days. First up, a trip to Manchester to watch the WWE. Now, I am not going to do a full match report in the style of Scott Keith or CRZ, because I presume you don't care that much and I do not know the difference between a wakigatame or a jujigatame, nor do I know what a reverse Argentine spinning DDT looks like to sufficiently describe the action (although, looking at that description, I may have described Brock Lesnar's F5).  *After an afternoon spent watching men in tights pretending to fight, it was off to see Finding Nemo, so expect a review. And then I might review  a non-Disney film! . Yes, big changes are coming to the blog...

         Well done to Rio's  pimp  agent, Pini Zahavi, for the most ludicrous reason to miss a drugs test. And I quote:   He was asked to take this test on a Sunday, but he could not because he was moving house.   Marvellous. I do understand though. Only last Sunday, I was too busy to take a piss, so imagine what it must have been like for Rio, who had the hard job of telling the man from Pickfords which box was the one packed with valuables.  By the way, England are f*cked for Saturday.

      *Some may accuse me of bias, but I thought the Leeds v Blackburn game was one of the best games of football I have seen at any level for quite a while. It was an open game with chances for both teams, and good refereeing from Uriah Rennie (I know, I'm as shocked as you) allowed a good flow. The changed team with BATTY~! and Oliembe and Johnson swapping between left wing and left back worked well together, with LFOC (for those unaware, Lazy Fat Overpaid C***, to describe a certain Australian player) looking motivated in the first half. I would have loved to have seen the odds before the game on a Batty header in the penalty area setting up a volley for Seth Johnson.  *Michael Owen's injury has me worried for the Turkey match. Unlike Beckham's 'injuries' ("Oh no! Injured before big game! Don't worry, I'll 'try' to recover in time."), this one will hurt us because he is the only player in the front line with the skill, experience and confidence to lead the attack against a top side. Here's hoping Beattie gets a chance before the useless lump that is Emile Heskey.  *I bought Natural Born Killers for Â£4 on DVD this weekend. What tipped it for me is the fact that they have included a documentary on the possible influence of the film on a series of killings. I have watched it, but may have to watch it again before I think of submitting a review w/ comedy 'Hollywood' banner due to the sheer amount of images that is constantly thrown at you. I will say, so far, I am not planning a killing spree. However, with a week at work and the possibility of Heskey playing on Saturday...  *The most unfortunate minute of TV planning occurred last night. A documentary on David Kelly, followed by "If you are having suicidal thoughts, please ring this hotline. Next, Derren Brown plays Russian Roulette....". Well played, Channel 4.     *Watching the said Derren Brown last night was quite the experience. We saw the selection process for the person who would be loading the bullet (a lot of which seemed like an excuse for Derren to pull out his tricks, which isn't a bad thing) and some lucky lad learnt that he is the easiest person to manipulate out of 12,000 people. The five minutes of Derren with the loaded gun was one of the most fascinating, horrifying and down right scary TV moments in years. Worse than seeing Southgate walk up to take a penalty. I have had a debate with the future Mrs. A-MOL about the 'fifth chamber shot' (where Derren seemed convinced this barrel was empty, fired at the sandbag instead of his skull and then appeared to panic as he realised it was empty) because this seemed typical of some of his previous work. In the dangerous situations, Brown always seems to have a moment where he is stuck and is about to make the wrong, potentially hazardous choice, only to suddenly turn the right way at the last moment. The way he held the gun to his head, fired, then turned at fired at the sandbag in a matter of seconds said to me that this was his final flourish on an impressive demonstration of his skills.

      Though this may not solve the Marsh Street Hauntings, it may explain another story of Popsy being attacked by the undead - the story of being choked by an unseen figure when younger. Allow me to go all Dana Scully and follow me into tales of lore…  In the olde dayes, people had the story of the Succubus or Old Hag. This was a demon who, in the middle of the night, would attack a man, wrapping her legs around him, Xenia Onatopp stylee, and humping him (Interesting note – German for Hag is Mare. A Mare who comes at Night. NightMare, you see!). Reports come from all over the world of men who feel they are being strangled, and some have claimed to see a ghostly figure on top of them. There is an equivalent that attacks women – the Incubus.  There was a tribe in the South Sea Isles that had a high occurrence rate of this story. Investigators went to have a look and found something intriguing. The tribe had a genetic disposition to Sudden Adult Death Syndrome – kind of like what happened to Marc Vivien Foe – and other breathing conditions. They found that during sleep, the body would sometimes stop breathing, causing the brain to jolt the person away, making them disorientated. Now, didn’t Popsy suffer from asthma when younger…?  Come on Greg! Give me a job as a documentary maker at the Beeb! I’d be about ten million times better than some guy who goes around interviewing stupid Americans and making them look stupid by raising an eyebrow at the right time.

      *Like Lloyd, I watched the rugby without giving two fucks, really. As can be confirmed by Inno, I sent a load of text having a go at England. At one point, England had a penalty just a few yards from the line, the Australians were still in front after the 3rd minute try (given away after some twat punched an Australian in the ruck. Gentleman's game my arse), so of course, we go for another fucking kick. Arseholes. Still, hell of a way to win it. Not including Inno and Wragg, a free piece of engineering to whoever can name the other sport we are currently world champions at.  *Leeds are shit. Viduka is a lazy fat twat. Harte is the worst player in the league. I think I need a macro to make this typing easier.  *Well, I got convinced to get up early on a Sunday morning to go shopping for PAPER~! in York. If that wasn't pussywhipped enough, it turned out there was a secret agenda to go shoe shopping. Arse. Still, we have a prototype invite and possibly an order of service.   *Inness lent us Stuntman for the PS2. Although, like he said, it does encourage you to throw your controller at the wall at high velocity, it's really cool and piss funny. After doing the first film, a typical London gangster thing, I'm now on the Dukes of Hazzard style levels. It's great, and I'm sure would be a laugh for a piss-up.  *More bollocks diproven by the Beeb - it turns out Kennedy probably wasn't killed as part of a conspiracy. Fucking BBC. There'll be nothing interesting left in the world soon with these bastards on it. I tell you what they need to do - an investigation into the Marsh Street Hauntings! EXPLAIN THAT, DYKE!

      No pictures this time, if only to appease certain hirsute members of this website.   Egg Chasing  Watched the rugby world cup final on Saturday, (and not at stupid o' clock like people in Blighty). Although it's the first time we've been World Champions in a meaningful sport in my entire lifetime, I couldn't help but think how I might have actually enjoyed it had I given two shits about rugby. Sure, the climax was great, but at the end of the day, there's really nothing  that  great about 15 posh sods with cauliflower ears playing with the sole intention of giving Jonny a chance to kick for three. Again, and again, and again. No wonder the Aussies hate us. And the French.   S****d F*****g K****n Censors   Kill Bill  rules. The fighting, the music, the Japanese schoolgirl with a nose to rival my own, it's all great. Probably even greater if you don't watch it in a country whose censors cut the film to shit. They showed a Shannon Tweed movie on Korean TV last night, and cut every sex scene just as the woman was getting her jugs out (I think the final running time was about 18 minutes). Mustn't grumble though, it's only 3 of your English pounds to go to the cinema here, and I'm not even a student.    Great website of the day   urlLink Bugs Music , despite its weird title, really does rule. If you've got a decent connection, go here, ignore all the Korean crap you can't read, stick damn near any band you want into the search engine and you can listen to all their albums in CD quality. I've been rockin out to the new Outkast and Blink albums all week. You can't save the files to HD, but still, it's the best music site I've ever seen. It's probably shit if you've just got a modem, though.

      Based on the Horizon documentary, I decided to look for hidden codes in The Life And Times Of A Pig Farmer by R.C.Tennison. The way to do it is to remove all punctuation and spaces, create a grid and look for formed from letters appearing at certain intervals. I found a warning, which may have given me second thoughts about giving Dan access to this site.

         Yeah! New graphic debut! Ahem... Horizon last night was about the Bible Code. Based on claims in the book by Michael Drosnin, the documentary talked about the appearance of words like "Kennedy" and "to die" being close to each other, predidcting stuff like the death of Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and The Gulf War. The whole thing falls apart, really, when Drosnin said that he would reconsider his believe in the Bible Code if he saw evidence that there was a assassination prediction in Moby Dick. When someone found one using the same methods, he backtracked, because, y'know, book sales and stuff.  My favourite part occurred two minutes in. Drosnin had sealed an envelope from 1998, in which laid two predictions. If these had come to pass, it meant we should be shit scared about his predicted nuclear attack on Jerusalem in 2006. His two predictions were:  *Economic Collapse *The destruction of a city  Drosnin, after opening it then says "Well, no-one can claim they haven't happened".  Wha...?  As far as I'm aware, we haven't had an economic collapse. As for the destruction of a city, he used the example of, sigh, Sept 11. That wasn't a destruction of a city, it was destruction of two skyscrapers. That's crap. If I say "I'm going to cut down a tree" and then snap two branches off it, the tree is still standing. Besides, if the Bible Code is so great, wouldn't it mention stuff like "New York", "Planes", "Two Towers", "Fucking hell!" and the like. And after finding this, wouldn't it be a good idea to TELL SOMEONE and not stick it in a envelope in your lawyers office like you're David fucking Blaine?  So, shite. But still, Les, if you are offered the chance to teach English in Israel in 2006, be careful.  *Michael Jackson's album sales are dissappointing. He is hanging around the lower teens!!!!!!1!!! Which is unusual, as he usually goes straight into the number 2 slot!!!!!!!!!1!!!!! LAUGH, YOU TWATS!!!

SHIPMAN!! The man is breaking bread with a granny killer! The bastard. I bet we get 'intelligence' that there are terrorists and WMDs in the retirement homes of Scholes.   *At time of writing, Scotland are getting whopped by a bunch of 'salt' addicts who hate each other and Wales are going out too. However disappointing, I think we can safely say, that today, we are all Latvians.

      Nah, let's not. Still, I was compiling my 'Santa' and birthday list and realised that I have sod all books on the list. This may be because I've tended to go out and buy the ones I wanted when they came out straight away. All I have on the list is a few Palahniuk books that I haven't got yet. So, I need  you  to recommend some good reading material for Chrimbo.

      *I won my first E-bay auction this week, so I spent most of Saturday playing with my new Audi TT Cou... er, sorry, Everybody's Golf for the PlayStation. The game is bollocks hard to find, but I picked it up for £12. Bargain. TFMrs A-Mol was sceptical at first, but by Sunday evening, she was working on the best way to grip the shaft.  *On Sunday, Wragg, Inno, Inno's Sis and I went to O** Tr*****d to watch England vs Denmark. Twas the first international match I had ever been to, which was cool. I dutifully went and bought an England kit (never had one before, but I do I have Eire and Holland shirts) ready for the occasion.  I never had a problem before with the SGE policy of about 9 substitutions in a game because I always thought it a good way to try out new players. However, after Rooney's shot against the post in the 55 minute, the game became very mundane due to the changes. I bet the other countries entering Euro 2004 are shitting themselves at the prospect of a midfield of P.Neville, Scott Parker, Jenas and Murphy. Phil Neville is a fucking embarrasment, I have no idea who first told Ashley Cole he was a defender, Glen Johnson needs a good couple of years in the U21's before thinking of first team action again and we are already reliant on an 18 year old to win us games. On the plus side, Joe Cole ruled.  *Strange going ons in Cleckheaton. Paranormal forces are gathering, strange portents are being reported. A haunted house in Marsh Street? It may be time for an investigation...  *Though Les is pimping me as a gym whore, it must be said that I have slipped. There was a week last month when I was off work that I went gym crazy, managing 2-3 hours a day, but alas, it has dropped off again. I need to get back into action. Besides, I never did shit like the treadmill, as I cannot bear doing the same thing for more than 5 minutes. I'm more Mister 10 Reps, just moving from machine to machine.

            Birds  I'm the one second from the left (Please, feel free to laugh at my Andy J-style hair). This was taken at English Immersion camp, where they take 30 schoolgirls, stick 'em with 6 English teachers and make 'em study. Since I was the only male under 30 there, there were plenty of "Riker to birds" moments throughout the week. But my name ain't Mike Finkle, and for a good reason.   Rock  Not related to Korea, but the new Blink 182 song is great. Really great.  I've Got Piglets  great.   Fat bloke  I've realised I'm really, really,  really  unfit after a not too gruelling 90 minute gym session (I got taken there by a (male) teacher at my school, who might as well be called Jeff Tae-Kwondo). He's the kind of guy that runs 6km on the treadmill, then looks on at you with disdain  from below an 100kg bench press while you're having a seizure after 800 sodding metres). Anyway, I collapsed on my bed at 8pm, and didn't regain consciousness until 7:30 this morning. I have a new found respect for our very own gym-whore A-MOL, and Mr Inness, of the Armed Forces.

         Matrix Revolutions   So, finally, after all the hype comes the concluding chapter of The Matrix Trilogy. The unfortunate problem for this film is that many film goers had been left confused and generally pissed off with the second film, Reloaded. While there were scenes and ideas that were successful in Reloaded, it was felt that next to the 1999 original, the sequel was laden with characters appearing to talk about the nature of choice for 10 minutes at a time. While an attempt to bring philosophy into an action film is an intriguing idea, it came off as very ham-fisted.  Revolutions takes place straight after the second film. Neo is trapped in a state between the Matrix and the 'real world'. After Trinity and Morpheus rescue him from the Merovingian ("Hey, Larry, shall we build up this guy and Persephone in the second film, only for them to appear for 2 minutes in the next?" "What a good idea, Andy!"), the survivors of the ill-fated attack on the machines must race back to Zion to stop the destruction of the city, while Neo and Trinity head off to the centre of the machine world to try and stop the war. All the while, the renegade program, Agent Smith, is gaining power.  The main problem I have with this film - about 40 minutes out of it's 129 minutes running time takes place in The Matrix, and only 15 minutes of this is what we would call action. Surely people loved The Matrix for the incredible, physics defying fight scenes, not the 'real world' with its crappy wool jumpers, shitty raves and council meetings that make look on the Senate hearings in The Phantom Menace with fondness. The highlight of the first film is Neo and Trinity destroying the entrance lobby. In this, we have a brief hope that there will be a scene to match this when Trinity, Morpheus and Seraph break into Club Hel ("Hey, Andy, can we fit some BDSM in this film?" "Fine, but I'm still not calling you Laura."), only for the scene to be done with in about 3 minutes, because that would get in the way of talking.  Lordy, the talking. This is a stinker of a script. The philosophy thrown about in this film is not insightful - it's just painful, reminding me of The Sphinx in Mystery Men ("To stop your fear from controlling you, you must first control your fear"). When Neo asks a program how he can love his daughter when love is a human emotion, the guy replies, "It is not an emotion, it is a word". Ugh. (By the way, am I the only person disturbed by the idea of programs having offspring? It may explain some of the crashes I have, though, if there is the bastard lovechild of PowerPoint and Championship Manager running around in here). And, instead of breaking new ground for action films, let's just consult Michael Bay's Big Book O' Action Film Clichés. A young kid pisses of a hardened general! But in war, he earns the generals respect! Niobe thinks she can navigate down a tight tunnel network but Stodgy Bloke #4 thinks it's suicide! Will she succeed?!  The characters suffer greatly as well. Neo comes across as a moron more than a saviour. Trinity has gone from the embodiment of girl power to Neo's bird. Morpheus, dear me, has gone in 3 films to a charismatic, strong leader, to a boring bloke who blabbers on about prophecy and nothing else. Agent Smith borders very close to pantomime villain at times, though it is to Hugo Weavings credit that he reins himself in well to keep his character a meaning presence.  The centrepiece of this film is the Sentinel Attack on Zion, just like the Freeway in the second film. It looks stunning and is a decent half hour of action. The problem here is that NONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE IN THIS SCENE!! It's stupid; the characters we've followed for two movies are not on screen for a good half hour. Our emotional core during this scene is an annoying little twat who Neo can't even stand in the second film, a general who constantly tries to stop the heroes and some woman moaning about how unfair her life is. Would it have asked too much to intercut this scene with Neo fighting Bane/Smith to at least keep is in touch with the star of the film? While the battle is impressive, the scene is rendered bewildering by the fact that the robots have the stupidest battle plan in the history of stupid battle plans. If you have an incredible numerical advantage over your opponents, which is the better plan?  a) Surround your opponents, attack from all directions in a swarm and finish the fight in no time at all. b) Move as one body in a pretty ribbon-like way, before heading straight down the firing line of your opponent's weapons.  If you answered b), you are an artificial intelligence which has apparently become 'very effective' at destroying Zion.   I don't want to ruin the end of the film for those who haven't seen it, but I will say this - the machines show even more stupidity than their battle plan and the final fight looks more like synchronised swimming that a fight for all humanity.  Oh, incidentally, did anyone else get the feeling that Neo might, just maybe, on some level, be a Christ-like figure? I'm not sure because it may have been a bit too subtle for me.  If you want an action film, it's fine. It does its job with kung-fu bits and exploding killer robots. The problem is that The Matrix made us believe that it was possible to have intelligent action films and it is sad to see the franchise end like this. If you do buy the inevitable disc set, worship the first film as classic piece of sci-fi with a bit of brains, watch the second for the Freeway and use the third as a coaster.   2/5

      (If you can't see shit above, switch your browser's encoding to Korean, and all will be clear. Or even more confusing. Heh.)      빼빼로 (or Pepero) are little biscuit sticks covered in chocolate. They're called Pocky in Japan, and to be honest, I like the Japanese ones better, because they have more comedy flavours, like melon, and green tea. Good shit. Just don't tell the Koreans I said that.  Anyway.... today is Pepero day in Korea. Why today? Because some brainiac in Lotte's marketing department thought that 11/11 looks suspiciously like four Pepero lined up together, and so this magical day was born. I got so washed up in the hype that I even forgot the other significance of November 11th.  But then, chocolate tastes better than a red paper flower, so can you blame me?    The one in the middle is called "Nude Pepero", because the chocolate's on the inside. Hmmm.

      So, it's good bye to the Monkey Heed. After losing 6-1 to Portsmouth, let's face it, he was in a dodgy position. So, three managers in 22 months, at a cost of £7M in compensation to them being shit. Bonus.  So who's next in the firing line? I've heard some dodgy ideas (Hoddle, Bryan Robson, WILKO!) and some really unlikely (O'Neill, Strachan), but it'll probably be Paul Hart.  *Saturday was the annual Jarratt Bonfire. We saw an impressive 1 hour and 40 minutes of explosions, which was fun, but maybe lacked the edge of previous years, because at no point did I feel in mortal danger.  *Not to say that Titchie has issues with buying gifts for his lass (we are all away of the famous dumping and reconcilliation around Valentine's Day), but since he is getting married next year on the 29th of February, the bastard only has to buy an anniversary gift every 4 years! Still, means it's highly unlikely we'll have to buy them a silver anniversary present.  Unlikely to hear much from me this week due to work (four days Darn Sarf). Still I may write up reviews of Finding Nemo (tops), Matrix Revolutions (shite) and 28 Days Later (decent).  Dan, the CD's are Nelly's new one and the Neptunes Present The Clones? Nice to see the curly haired twunt from N'Sync is flushing away his cred by doing jingles for McDonalds. There are comparisons however, between McDonalds food and his music - both are bought in huge amounts despite the lack of quality and taste.

      Hello.  So yeah, I'm in Korea. It's weird. But great. When I get my arse in gear and upload my photos and get them on the net, I'll write something of more importance. Maybe. For now, please enjoy this picture of my bird's dog. If it works.     It does. Nice.  And now, here's 5 questions I've been thinking about the most this week.  1) So anyway, I bought the Matrix Reloaded on DVD t'other day, in preparation for seeing Revolutions this weekend. Anyhow, my favourite line in the movie is where that guy is talking about swearing in French, and he says "It's like wiping your arse with silk". Now, the second language on my DVD is Thai, so I switched the sound track to Thai just out of curiosity to see if he speaks French with a comedy Thai accent, but the bastard just keeps speaking Thai! So WTF is he saying?   2) It's the middle of November. It's frickin' freezing out here, Mr. Bigglesworth. So why, why, why am I still getting the shit bitten out of me by mosquitoes?  3) Is Korea warping my musical tastes? I can't buy anything decent in the music shops round here (mainly because no bugger buys music here, they just download it. Fact: Korea is the best country in the world for Internet access. It's great, I tells ya) yet I still have a CD buying addiction. So the last 2 CDs I bought both have guest appearances from Justin Timberlake. First prize of a hearty bowl of 보신탕 (that's dog soup to you Wurzel) goes to the person who guesses the CD titles correctly.  4) Why did my school think it was more important for me to attend a conference on good, nutritious school dinners (all in Korean, and with bugger all free samples. Bastards), instead of letting me stay at school and teach classes? Not that I minded. Sleeping through a Korean conference beats actual work any day.  5) Does anyone read this crap?

They keep beating me with their hairy arses!  (And look, I can BEND OVER AND SUCK MY OWN BALL SACK, so watch it - Ed.)  He's a fine-looking, polite and sopisticated gent, is that A-Mol.

      As you may know, The Guardian is to take legal action to overturn a court injunction preventing them from naming a royal servant who was alleged to have been caught having 'relations' with a senior royal.  Apropos to nothing, here's an old news story:   The Sunday Mirror  Sunday, March 16, 2003    Princess Diana made a sensational secret video diary in which she complained that Charles had an "unhealthy relationship" with top aide Michael Fawcett, the Sunday Mirror can reveal.  Diana, looking tearful and drawn, complains on camera: "He is too close to Fawcett - what can one do when your husband is in an unhealthy relationship" with a servant?  She also tells how Charles and his close aide appeared "uncomfortable" and "uneasy" after being disturbed while together in one of the Prince's private rooms.

      Titch has alerted me to the presence of a famous guy with a funny name - Thomas Wanker, who did music for  Buffy The Vampire Slayer . However, there are is a more famous pair of Wankers.  In ye olde dayes, Channel 4 relied on repeats of old American sitcoms to fill the troubled 6pm - 7pm timeslot, which is now completely revamped with, er,  Friends  repeats and  Hollyoaks  (Five times a week and a late night special on Wednesday! Woo hoo!). One of these shows was  Mork and Mindy . The episode in question featured an evil couple who were trying to evict Mindy from the music store. Fortunately for our heroes, the evil bloke had a heart attack and died. However, on hearing everyone lie about how great the bloke was at the funeral, Mork resurrectted him, only to be told off by Mindy for doing so. (By the way - Fuck you, Mindy. It was an honest mistake for an alien to make when studying our society. How's he meant to know you are being insincere? And now he knows you were talking shit, why should he trust you? You don't deserve him, or your old man-baby.)  Anyway, parents dutifully complained because the name of this couple - Arnold and Annie WANKER! Fantastic! I believe the episode is now banned in this country. It's a shame no-one asked the producers about it, because there is surely a high chance of someone saying "But there are a lot of wankers in the US..."

      Well, I should be fully relaxed and prepared for the challenges ahead due to an enforced holiday (God bless poor manufacturing business and piss poor management).  So, here's a quick list of stuff I did this holiday.  *Slept  *I went to TFMrs A-MOL's sister's wedding last Saturday. It was a good day, plus it give me and TFMrs a few tips on how to do it better in June (like getting a pro photographer so that our pictures won't be in shadow! Ha ha, fools!). I'm not sure how drunk I got; I'm still engaged, so not completely drunk, but I did join in the Irish dancing.   *Would you believe, after months of badgering me not to spend cash so that the tossers at our wedding can have nice placeholders at the tables, TFMrs went crazy and bought four DVD's and two PlayStation games. Crazy. I watched Donnie Darko again, thinking I understood it went I rented it, but after watching again, with and without Director's Commentary, I think I'm even more confused. DareDevil has also gone up in my estimation after repeated viewing, if only that I now, forever, have that scene of Jennifer Garner vs Sandbags to get me through the cold evenings.  *I also went to Leeds Uni and Huddersfield Uni, to investigate options for my SUPER SECRET PLAN for next year. What could it be...?  *Oh, and Leeds lost to a bunch of reserves and then got crapped on by a fast Frenchmen and are bottom of the league. But at least the Lazy Fat Overpaid C*nt is off, thanks to his inability to buy a good watch despite being on £65k a week.  Before I sign off, congrats to Inno and Jimnutz for getting some action this past week. Keep it up, boys!

      Images from The Shoulder of Mutton that are of interest (to me, okay).  1.   Titchie has somehow managed to not shave while under the watchful eye of Olwen.  2.   Dave Benson in  a shirt! . And,  clean hands!   3.   On the right, the reason for Dave's cleanliness.  Oh, and one the left, the rare and hard to photograph  Innosbirdus Ashleyi .

      When you live in a country where Christmas is over on December 25th, 23:59:59, the rest of the holidays are pure shite.  Last day of term today. No classes, but I had to come in anyway. Bored off my tits. The internet doesn't have enough interesting crap on it.  Weirdest thing to happen today: ex-girlfriend (Japan) calls to ask my advice on some guy she likes. Offers precious little in the way of details, but still babbles for nigh on 15 minutes before my phone cut out. This was a girl who called me precisely once, on my birthday, and for about 5 minutes, when we were going out and I was in England. WTF?  I'm off home to spend the rest of the day playing Champs, listening to all the albums mentioned below, and eating weird rice type things.  Happy New Year! Just remember, I'll be counting down and getting pissed a full 9 hours before you. Or I might just be home in bed, because apparently most Koreans only celebrate the chinese New Year. They do it without the comedy dragons though.

      Assuming you do have plenty of disposable income available, and you're not planning for expensive weddings / just bought a car / house, buy these:   20. Lagwagon -  Blaze   It's probably going to be their last album. Shit.  Best song:   Burn    19. Less Than Jake -  Anthem   The Science Of Selling Yourself Short is my favourite song of the year. The video's great, too.  Best song:   The Science Of Selling Yourself Short      18. Radiohead -  Hail To The Thief   There's still a fair heap o' shite on this album, but it deserves inclusion if only for the fact that Jonny Greenwood is back playing guitar like a mentalist, and Phil Selway actually has something to do other than go "That's some nice drum programming, guys. I'm off to the off license".  Best song:   Go To Sleep    17. Anti-Flag -  The Terror State   Sure, the lyrics read like an 8th grader's guide to Why You Should Hate George W Bush, but the music rocks, there's no denyin'.  Best song:   Turncoat    16. Rancid -  Indestructable   Like every Rancid album mixed up with a blender and spat out. There's only one shit song on it out of 19 as well.  Best song:   Red Hot Moon    15. 50 Cent -  Get Rich Or Die Tryin'   You love it too.  Best song:   Many Men (Wish Death)    14. Rise Against -  Revolutions Per Minute   Shouty.  Best song:   Heaven Knows    13. Blink-182 -  Blink-182   If you bet 3 years ago that you'd see a Blink 182 album with Robert Smith on it, a DJ-Shadow style song and Joanne Whalley reading some old World War 2 love letters, then you'd probably be cleaning up now.  Best song:   Stockholm Sydrome    12. Cave In -  Antenna   If there's one band that deserved your attention in 2003, it was Cave In. But you didn't even give 'em the time of day. You ignorant bastard.  Best song:   Inspire . Rokken!   11. Dashboard Confessional -  A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar   Get past the whine and this is a fine, fine rock album.  Best song:   Hands Down    10. Alkaline Trio -  Good Mourning   My sister's got their logo as a tattoo. I made do with buying their albums instead. Why don't you too? They're all great.  Best song:   Emma    9. The Mars Volta -  De-Loused In The Comatorium   Afro-haired blokes from At The Drive In start a band, add plenty of wanky guitar parts and long instrumental bits, and this is what comes out at the end.  Best song:  the third one. I forget what it's called.   8. AFI -  Sing The Sorrow   Davey Havok may look like a girl now, but don't let that put you off. Produced by Butch Vig, this was.  Best song:   Death Of Seasons    8  (I forgot this one, but couldn't be arsed to change the numbers).  The Darkness -  Permission To Land   You know it's great already.  Best song:   Get Your Hands Off My Woman     7. Outkast -  Speakerboxxx / The Love Below   2 albums for the price of one. One is damn good hip-hop, the other is weird sex-funk. Probably great to shag to. I ain't tried it yet.  Best song:   Hey Ya!     6. Yellowcard -  Ocean Avenue   They're a punk band with a full-time violin player. Kind of like The Corrs meet Blink 182. No, because that would be shit.  Best song:   Breathing    5. NOFX -  The War On Errorism   I told you about this already.  Best song:   Regaining Unconsciousness    4. The Lawrence Arms -  The Greatest Story Ever Told   All the best bands have 2 singers. Blink 182, Rancid, Yellowcard, Outkast, Alkaline Trio, Anti-Flag, Less Than Jake, The Blood Brothers, and The Lawrence Arms. Wow, a lot of bands have 2 singers. That's probably where Monssfisch went wrong. We should never have stripped Matty of his mic.  Best song:   On With The Show    3. Thrice -  The Artist In The Ambulance   Good Lord, this rocks.  Best song:   Paper Tigers    2. Streetlight Manifesto -  Everything Goes Numb   As does this, but in a very different way.  Best song:   Point / Counterpoint    1. The Blood Brothers -  Burn Piano Island, Burn!!!   If you imagine At The Drive In had an epileptic fit on stage, but instead of helping them, the paramedics and crowd just started dancing, screaming and generally rocking out, it's a bit like this album.  Best song:   Fucking's Greatest Hits

      Fuck Onetel and their shitty server.  So, here I am, Christmas Eve, watching 100 Greatest TV Moments of 2003, while half-cut on TFMrs present of M&S Champagne, red wine and vodka and Red Bull.   Since I haven't much time before the celebration of the birth of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, here's a few quick notes:  -INNO HAS A BIRD!!! She's called Ashley, a friend of Dave's bird, Claire. More news as it breaks... -Oh, and he has a new car. But fuck that, he's getting some lovin'! -Titch's invite for the wedding of the year* has arrived. -Leeds still not completely shit. -Jarratt's hair is returning to it's old Sixth form state. -The record buying public of the UK are morons. The Darkness were leading up until Friday lunchtime. Arse.  *Wedding of year up to and including 11 June 2004.  So, just to say:  MERRY XMAS, ONE AND ALL!!

         Fuck me,  Return Of The King  really does rule. I've read a couple of reviews of it, and you know a film is truly great when people bitch about stupid things, like "At 3 and a half hours, the movie seems a little rushed", or "I wanted to see the end of Saruman". Fucking why? You already know he's up shit creek, just get on with the good stuff. Even the mega-happy never-seems-to-end-ending (I swear the people in my cinema got up like 3 times thinking the movie was over. Daft bastards) is enjoyable, if only because these are the final moments of the greatest movie trilogy ever, and you just don't want it to end.   Found a great DVD shop in Gwangju (you might know it, it's the one next to Lotte department store) and got Phone Booth and Taxi 2 for less than a fiver each. Phone Booth rules, but then you know that already. Taxi 2 is the best action movie to come out of Europe since, well, Taxi. I forget the lead guy's name, but he looks like a French Adam Sandler, and he's piss funny. Plus, you can't say no to a 20 police car pile up, Emma Sjoberg doing some high karate kicking in a short skirt, and constantly taking the piss out of the Japanese. If you don't speak French, then the subtitling is surprisingly well done, although blatantly done by an American (the French call us Rosbifs (Roast beef), which is translated as Limeys. Twats)  It snowed, and I caught a cold.    Oh yeah. Went to Pizza Hut on Friday for the first time, well, since I worked there. I don't know about in England, but in Korea there's a pizza called Rich Gold, which is foul. What they do is put a layer of cheese in the crust, and a layer of mashed-up sweet potato. Not only does the stuff look like an acne-sufferers bathroom mirror after a good squeezing session, its taste (think mashed potato + shitloads of sugar) doesn't go at all well with mozzarella, tomato sauce, peppers and spicy 'beef'. Shite.  I still haven't got my presents from England yet. Or Champs. The postal service are bastards. Oh yeah, and so are Amazon. 11 pounds (thats 23,000 pissed off Korean won to you) to wrap 4 presents? Bastards are raking it in.  In good news, end of term classes are a piece of piss. And it looks like I've got the whole of January off. Nice one.

         Fuck balls of light in Cleckheaton, this is the good shit!   urlLink     This is a pic from Hampton Court, former home of Henry VIII and apparently a very creepy place at night. Apparently, for two days in a row, the fire escape opened in an empty room, setting off the alarms.  To find out what it was, they checked the CCTV and found the doors opened by themselves, and then THAT walked out.   Fuck, yeah. I don't care if it turns out to be a twat in a costume, that's how you sell a ghost story.

      Not sure on the full details, but here's some info. Sports Interactive are the company that created the game, Eidos publish it. It seems the two have fallen out. Therefore, after CM03/04, the Championship Manager series will either end or be completely different to the current release. So, if you want future upgrades, look for the SI logo as that is probably the game you know and love.

      Comedy bar/restaurant/shop names! There are literally shit loads in Gwangju, from the fashion outlet "Batman" (young womens' clothes) to my local bar "Drink.com" (honest!) Now, I realise A-Mol would go ape if I stuck every photo on here, so here's two of my favourites.    Now there's an enticing sign if ever I saw one. By the way, "Hof" is from the German word, Hof, and in Korean means beer or bar. Soju is the liquor of choice here, it's about 20%, dirt cheap, and gets you pissed. Quickly.  The Korean at the top means "Let's not drink too much". Or, as Babelfish puts it, "Excessive drinking the summer solstice roll up".   And my no.1, all-time favourite....     I love how ostentatious the word "Cock" is on the sign. The Korean next to it is explaining the kind of food they sell here, namely chicken done Korean-style, with noodles. And the best thing is, this is a chain restaurant, so Cock can be readily found in any major town and city. There are two in Gwangju alone, although one Cock is a little bigger than the other.

      *Ooh! I was close with five years earlier. Still, Maxine could be out within 30 days, with an electronic tag on her leg.  *An 11-1 majority verdict for both. That's right, one juror not only believed the Frank Spencer-esque "Knocked one in the bath and accidently strangled the other", but also that Maxine Carr did not lie to help his sorry arse out. Christ, I'd like to meet this person. I have a bridge over the Thames I'd like to sell them.  *Interesting bit of previous - June 1999. Huntley accused of rape. Cleared after alibi from... (a free bit of engineering if you can guess)  *That blind fascist Blunkett is trying the ol' "Let's look to be doing something" trick by asking how the council ending up employing Huntley. How about, "Because he was never convicted of anything and so wouldn't appear on a sex offenders register", you cunt. That goes with the News Of The World's moronic "Sara's Law".  *Ian Huntley is possibly one of the stupidest people in the world (apart from possibly, that jury member). He told police he was probably the last person to see them alive, but then, an old woman said she saw the two a few hours later. Now, instead of capitalising on this piece of senile good fortune, he aroused suspiscion by going around calling the old woman a liar. Note to all aspiring killers -  IF SOMEONE IS TAKING THE FOCUS OF AN INVESTIGATION AWAY FROM YOU, GO ALONG WITH IT .  *TV interview of the year from Sky: "I'm here with one of Ian Huntley's schoolfriends. How would you have described Ian back then?" "He was small, with a large forehead."

      *Just when we get the good news of football on terrestrial TV, we get bad news - 24 Series 3 has been bought by Sky.  The whole 24 sale could be seen as a bit dodgy. Fox, the producers, owned by Rupert Murdoch, have fallen out with the BBC, who want to use a different satellite to Rupert Murdoch's Sky. Fox are pissed off for one of two possible reasons:   - The satellite the Beeb want to use isn't encrypted. This means that people is Europe can watch it through the BBC before a badly dubbed version appears on their TV. This means less viewers, so less power for Fox to negotiate prices, and possible spoilers getting out, like "It waz ze agent he waz zleeping wit" and "Sheries 2 est merde".   - Sky won't get the revenue from the Beeb for use of the satellite.  So, of course, they stop the BBC, and start a bidding war, shockingly resulting in Rupert Murdoch's most succesful program appearing on Rupert Murdoch's TV service. And who loses out, as always? That's right, me.  Noticed in a report on the football deal - "ITV may have scheduling issues if they purchased the rights, so may have to show the games on ITV2". Way to help the terrestrial viewer, dipshits. It's not like they got in trouble before when they put a World Cup match on ITV2 (South Africa v Paraguay, interrupted so terrestrial viewers could get build up for an England match, with the "interesting" views of Gary Neville and Paul Gascoinge). Mind you, I do think it is important the nation gets it's fill of Steve "Cunt" Penk, "[Blank]s From Hell" and "An Audience With A Twat".  *So, the Soham judge has said he will accept a majority verdict instead of a unanimous one. Ever get that impression that people want to be finished by Christmas? It'll get to 3pm, Friday - "For fuck's sake! Oh forget it - Guilty, Guilty, Life, 5 years, goodbye, home".  *Is it obvious my boss is sick today?

      As a lot of you will know, I often spend my time watching buff, sweaty men rolling around, trying to get on top of each other. And I also like wrestling (*rimshot*, or maybe *rimjob*>.  Anyway, I have bought a new book written by a guy who runs an internet site dedicated to certain aspects of wrestling. He has put all the content into producing -   urlLink     Wrestlecrap - The Book.  Randy Baer (also known by his former wrestling manager alias, R.D. Reynolds) has run the wrestlecrap.com website for many years now, which catalogued basically everything that made people embarrassed to watch wrestling - stuff like fueds based on a fat wrestler sitting on a man's pet snake, matches where the winner is the first one to get a turkey from the top of a pole and dumb characters, like a wrestling tax man. As the site became increasingly popular, the site had to come down due to the bandwidth caused by the visitors. For this reason, it became an obvious idea to put it all in a book.  The book is structed into chapters covering different historical periods in the last 25 years or so of wrestling, starting from the birth of WWF's "Rock and Wrestling" age and finishing with WWE's flirtation with necrophilia (Heh. I might do my own little piece on this one for you lot, because the whole thinking behind it is incredibly stupid), with chapters on the fall of WCW and the movie career of Hulk Hogan.  Although probably written with wrestling fans in mind, the book explains early on a lot of the 'behind the curtain' stuff so that a reader with little understanding of the "sport" can follow the discussions. One of the main reasons for this that R.D., except in the cases of Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior and Ed Leslie, doesn't rest blame on the shoulders of the wrestlers themselves for the crap, but on the bookers and management members who believed that this stuff was the way to make money. On particular chapter focusses on Vince Russo, a booker in the last year or so of WCW, who seemed to believe that a wrestling show could win over fans by featuring hardly any wrestling.  The book is written in a style that is warm, accessible and funny. The only issue is, I would say, that the book cannot retain the interactive feel of the original website. It's great to get a description of Battle Kat, but the website had pictures and animations of the guy in action, which made you realise the absolute folly of sticking a cat mask on a 6ft 225 pound bloke and sending him out on TV. The story of the Cactus Jack amnesia angle is told well, but without the sound clips of the lines Mick Foley had to say to try and get the angle across, it does lose some of the humour. Still, this is a top book, and if you want information on how to run a wrestling company into the ground or the thinking process that ends up with plumbers and dentists on TV, this is the book for you.   urlLink Wrestlecrap  is still updated every week, and maybe, if the book and the future work of RD Reynolds are successful,  we will see the site back to it's full glory.

      God bless school exams. No classes for the rest of the week. 4 and a half day weekend!! Which means I can drink myself stupid at my birds (27th!!!) birthday party  ce soir , not having work tomorrow. And Return of the King's just going to rule.  If only I'd ordered Champs 03/04 a week earlier, then I'd be in wanking heaven. Still, there's always this picture of Jarratt dressed as popular 90's rap artist MC Santa to ease the pain.

      David Beckham made light of the last-minute bust-up with Argentinian midfielder Lionel Scaloni which marred Real Madrid's 2-1 defeat of Deportivo La Coruna last night.  The referee eventually showed both a yellow card, although Scaloni still refused to shake Beckham's hand as the bad feeling continued.  ``Scaloni didn't want to shake hands with me, and I don't know why. That's another Argentinian who doesn't like me,'' said Beckham, referring to previous spats with Diego Simeone and Aldo Duscher.  Scaloni, whose side now trail leaders Madrid by six points, had a vastly different view of the incident and accused Beckham of lacking respect.  ``It was a quiet game, and nothing had happened,'' he said.  ``I didn't shake hands with him because he was touching his genitals in a disrespectful way.''

      Well, with one weekend before Christmas, here are the favourites for the Christmas Number 1. As for most years, pretty shite.   2/5 - Pop Idol 12, Happy Xmas (War is Over)     Jesus, this was crap when John and Yoko did it. What makes Simon Cowell think this ‘song’ needs to be covered by a bunchy of spotty, fat, ugly karaoke singers? Tossers, the bunch of them. And I’m glad that little scrotum-sucker from Barnsley with the same haircut as the winner of Fame Academy is out.    4/1 - The Darkness, Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)      BUY THIS! BUY TWO COPIES! BUY TWO COPIES FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW! Dear lord, this is fucking awesome. A great 70’s rock style Christmas song in the style of Wizzard and Slade, including a shout of “Come On, Kids!”.    8/1 - Michael Andrews feat Gary Jules, Mad World      Hmmm, weird. A two-year-old cover version, this has been getting a lot of play on Radio 2 in the past few months, probably because Wogan got around to watching Donnie Darko. As a song, I don’t think it works as well without the images it is set to in the film.   14/1 - Ozzy and Kelly Osbourne, Changes      Crap. Really bland. Probably wouldn’t even be No 1. now if it wasn’t for someone off their tits jumping on a quad bike, Rik Mayall-stylee.    20/1 - Avid Merrion, Proper Crimbo      I wish a long and painful death of Leigh Francis and any cunt who buys anything to do with Bo, Selecta!   20/1 - UB40, Swing Low, Sweet Chariot      FUCKING KILL ME NOW. Egg chasing, blind patriotism by twats who never watched the sport until three weeks ago and the worst band outside of Ocean Colour Scene. What a load of crap.  So, hopefully, The Darkness will claim their first number 1. Unfortunately,as we know, the vast majority of single buyers are arses and most people who want The Darkness have already been on Kazaa. So, as we get ready for a Christmas where explosons will still be heard in Baghdad, let's have a song with a completely inappropriate subtitle full of hypocritical sentiments from a drugged up, dead scouser.  **UPDATE** I have information that is usually reliable, but I accept no responsibility for the accuracy of this unless, of course, it's right. Put your money on The Darkness, but it you want cover yourself, put a bit on Gary Jules. Monster!  **UPDATE UPDATE** Well, my info was pretty reliable. Darkness in lead, Gary Jules a couple of thousand behind, both outselling Pop Twunts 3:1. William Hill has cut the odds on The Darkness and Gary Jules to 8/11 and 5/2 respectively.

      *Leeds cannot be bottom for Xmas! A four point gap means that Wolves will be the team that faces the unenviable task of disproving the axiom “The team that is bottom of Premiership on Christmas day will be relegated”. And, dear lord, if we get six points from our next two games (an out of form Manchester City and a shit Aston Villa), we could actually be in a “challenging for Europe” position due to the tightness of the league at the moment. Awesome.   A funny situation at the moment with Leeds - Eddie Gray cannot become our manager officially because he doesn’t have a coaching badge. The solution might be to give him a title other than ‘Manager’, like “Head Coach” or “Director Of Football”, and have him still do the same job. Fantastic!   *So, I here they found an old man hiding in a cellar this weekend. Great. Remember when Al Jazeera was showing videos and photos of captured or dead Allied troops while the Pentagon and Whitehall screamed “Geneva Convention! Won’t somebody please think of the Geneva Convention!”? Well, guess what, it doesn’t apply when the Yanks want to show a prisoner of war! Here’s a picture of him having his teeth examined! Here’s a picture of him without a beard so that you can be sure we didn’t pick some old bloke of the streets of Baghdad and pay him a few dollars to pretend to be a dictator for our cameras! Shall we get those old pictures of his dead sons out again? The originals or the ones after the really crappy plastic surgery reconstructions?     One of my favourite statements today came from Donald Rumsfeld, Saddam’s old mate. “He is being uncooperative with the interrogators… He is refusing to give the details of his weapons program”. He. “Have you got weapons?” “No.” “You uncooperative bastard!”  *I have the first five or so pages of my screenplay done! COME ON! I’ve altered the first pages already, Richard, so if you try to steal my idea or sell the pages to an unscrupulous film studio, YOU WILL FAIL.  *I found a top movie in one of my favourite ways (Late night BBC2, “Oh, I’ve heard of this”). It’s called ‘Ginger Snaps’, and it is pretty darn cool. Imagine ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ mixed with ‘American Werewolf In London’. So, if you want a horror film that has a sense of humour and doesn’t talk itself too seriously, and cannot wait for my script to go through development and, y’know, writing, I highly recommend it. Might give it a review because I haven’t done one in ages. Another great bit of watchable entertainment discovered this weekend – Futurama “Where No Fan Has Gone Before”, in which a green, energy cloud pits the Planet Express crew vs. the Original Star Trek crew (plus Welshy, the replacement for Scotty), in a battle to the death. Top stuff.

      Go  urlLink here . Please. Not sure why I signed up when there's plenty of other places to write crap at. I like the title though. Better than the shite on this page. Seriously Haigh, how do you expect to entice readers with "The life and times of a bored bloke with too much time on his hands"?   I'm all pent up today. I watched "Once Were Warriors" last night, got fuck all sleep, had to teach 4 half full classes of disinterested (though occasionally cool) 3rd graders (16 year olds). Hey, how's this for a stroke o' genius - the Gwangju Education Office think it's a great idea for students to sit their final exams 3 weeks before the end of term, meaning they are 4 times more likely to piss about in class, because they know they've already got their grades. And classes were half-full today because they're all off on interview days at high schools. Of course, no fucker told me.   You should all listen to this album :   because it just might be the best damn thing you've never heard. At least download "The Crowing" on Kazaa and start wanking.

         All Offspring albums since Smash sound the same. Splinter is no exception. There's the hear it once, skip it forever intro; the really good, fast rocking track 2 with "Whoa-oh"'s aplenty; the not-quite-as-rocking-but-still-damn-good track 3; the supremely catchy/irritating (delete as appropriate) lead single; the slower, "We thought about turning into a serious rock band for a while, but got bored. Anyway, here's what we came up with" song; a couple of speedy punk tracks towards the end of the album that you have to listen to at least 4 times before they make any kind of impression on you; and of course, a God-awful ska song that makes you want to kill yourself.  The point being, it really depends on what kind of mood you're in. I thought Smash was the best thing since sliced bread, thought Ixnay was a bit "Meh", listened to Americana pretty much non-stop for 3 months (skipping Why Don't You Get A Job every time, naturally), couldn't have cared less about Conspiracy Of One, and as for Splinter? I really like it. I like it because once you trim all the crap off (Intro, Hit That, Worst Hangover Ever, When You're In Prison) you're left with 20 minutes of almighty rocking music. And when you only pay 6 pounds for a CD like in Korea, it ain't a bad deal, all told.  On a side note, I want the Tenacious D and Foo Fighters DVDs for Christmas. You should too.

      These are like my pre-New Year Resolutions. I am making them now as I can feel myself falling into The Rut again. So here are my plans -    Get Fit, Again  This has slipped in the past few months. However, due to having 2 weeks off over Chrimbo, I will be making a concerted effort to visit the gym and get myself looking good for 2004.   Put My Top Secret Project Into Action  I have a January visit lined up for a secondary school in Dewsbury. This should tell me whether or not I want a year of poverty, and probably bar work, to get out of my dead end job. I have asked Hannah about was all us hip, groovy educators wear in school, so I won't look like a complete tool.   Write A Screenplay  Okay. This is semi-serious. I accept that the chances of me writing a screenplay that would start a bidding war between Scorcese, Jackson, Speilberg and Burton (The Wachowski's can go fuck themselves. They probably would as well, the sick freaks). However, I have got an idea for a story in my head, and I think it would be good to get it down if only to amuse me and about 5 other people. I will give a co-writers credit to whoever can give me a title. The general idea for the story, at the minute, is like a mixture between the Exorcist, Ghostbusters and Clerks.  So, at the moment, these are my plans for the next few months. I'll keep you posted on how it's all going.  At the time, I would like you to spare a thought for Ms. Zora Suleman. Zora is, of course, the newsreader of RI:SE, the C4 breakfast show which will be axed in the New Year. Zora has a unique version of presenting the news - she tends to lean forward and pull her shoulders back to show off her ample assets while looking through her fringe with "I-know-you've-just-got-up-but-come-to-bed" eyes. Quite frankly, with Kate Lawler's broadcasting skills and having to watch Iain Lee without Daisy Donovan next to him to ease the pain, Zora is the only real reason to watch this shambles of a program.     However, Zora has issues. She feels she cannot get presenting or reporting jobs with the BBC because people cannot take her seriously with her prominent breasts. Who knows why this should be as she has shown her keen presenting skills with such carefully constructed links like (as I heard) "Now, more on that 7 year old who got shot" and (as reported on other websites) "Now, more on those dead girls in Soham"? And large breasts never stopped John Simpson, and in fact may have helped him when he wore a burkha to pretend to be a Muslim lady so that he could sneak into Kabul. So, at this time, it would appear that the former Capital FM DJ who only got on TV because of her huge knockers will disappear from our screens in three weeks time. In order to cope, I think I will have to get TFMrs. to "assume the Zora position" and read The Guardian to me.

      Is the new Championship Manager 4 any good, or is it shit, like the first CM4? I can't find a review of it anywhere. I've ordered it off amazon, of course, but all the reviews there are are from pissed off CM4 players who haven't even played the new version, saying things like "I'm not wasting my money on this when SI couldn't be bothered to give us a complete game blah blah blah". Has Dan Wragg got it?

      So, I went down the local arcade, and it turns out there's bugger all Ceilidh on Dance Dance Revolution, so lucky I found  urlLink this website , really then.  Here's a couple of my personal favourites for those who can't be arsed to look at it:     The Dashing White Sergeant   Formation: three facing three around the room, man between two ladies or lady between two men.   Music: The Dashing White Sergeant - 32 bar reels, starting and ending with "The Dashing White Sergeant".   Bars:  Description   1-8:  Join up in a circle of 6 and circle round to the left for 8 steps (4 bars) and back to the right.    9-12:  The person in the middle turns to the person on their right and sets to them, then turns them once round right hand (variation - both hands). The other partner stands still.    13-16:  Repeat with the other partner.    17-24:  Using elbow grip, turn 1st partner, then 2nd partner, then 1st partner, then 2nd partner. (Variation - dance a reel of three, giving left shoulder to 1st partner to start).    25-28:  In the lines of three, advance towards each other (two skip steps) and retire.    29-32:  Both lines dance forwards, one line raising their hands in an arch and the other line dancing underneath, and dance on to meet the next set of three coming in the other direction.      Repeat with new three.     The Gay Gordons  Formation: couples around the room facing anti-clockwise, ladies on the right.   Music: 2/4 or 4/4 march. E.g. "Scotland the Brave", "The Gay Gordons".   Bars:  Description   1-2:  Right hands joined over lady's shoulder (man's arm behind her back) and left hands joined in front, walk forward for four steps, starting on the right foot.    3-4:  Still moving in the same direction, and without letting go, pivot on the spot (so left hand is behind lady and right hand is in front) and take four steps backwards.    5-8:  Repeat in the opposite direction.    9-12:  Drop left hands, raise right hands above lady's head. Lady pivots on the spot. (The man may set).    13-16:  Joining hands in ballroom hold, polka round the room.      Repeat ad lib.     Strip the Willow  Formation: Longwise sets of 4 couples, men on the right and ladies on the left as viewed from the band. Couples number from nearest the band.  Music: 6/8 or 9/8 double jigs. E.g. "The Irish Washerwoman", "The Curlew", "The Jig of Slurs" for 6/8 and "Drops of Brandy" for 9/8.   Bars:  Description   1-8  1st couple spin RH.   9-20  1st lady turns 2M LH, partner RH, 3M LH, partner RH, 4M LH.   21-24  Spin with partner RH to the end of the phrase.   25-36  1st man turns 4L LH, partner RH, 3L LH, partner RH, 2L LH.   37-40  Spin with partner RH to the end of the phrase.   41-52  1st lady works down men, while 1st man works down ladies, turning 2C LH, partner RH, 3C LH, partner RH, 4C LH.   53-56  Spin with partner RH to the end of the phrase.   Repeat ad lib.       Two words. What? and Eh?

      Just to get all down to try and answer questions:  The wedding party (ushers, best man and me) will be wearing a morning suit with either a blue or purple waistcoat/cravat-or-tie set.  Titchie can get drunk if he wants, but he must remember he has to deal with our families and give a speech. Any failure on his part will result in it being mentioned everytime we meet in future, if I'm even allowed to talk to you, and our first-born son will not be named "Richard" (This probably wouldn't happen anyway, but y'know....). There's not much call for anyone else to watch their intake, except remember that your suits are hired, Inno and Les.  There will probably not be a first dance, which is good for me as I would hate to everyone watch my pathetic attempts at dancing (I'm also worried that I cannot fake singing of the hymns when I'm a foot away from the vicar). No-one is required to dance with bridesmaids if you don't want to, and it certain cases, it will be actively discouraged.  I shared all your concerns about a Ceilidh dance until I went to TFSister-in-Law's wedding, where I was up and dancing despite not being that drunk. It's simplicity is that no-one can do the dance correctly - every ends up looking like an arse and making mistakes and it's just basically a lot of fun. You will hear the standard Ceilidh dance classics such as:  "Wait, Is It To The Left Then Spin, Or Spin Then Left?", "Bollocks, I Told You We Went Wrong Earlier",  "I Was Next To Dan Earlier, How Did I End Up Next To You?", "God Lord, Is That An Electric Violin? (Extended Dance Mix)" plus a special performance from the groom's mother of "Bloody Hell, You're All Useless. Here's How You Do It".

      *Ah, the blessed return of an old friend. I like football again! Leeds vs Chelsea was great, the kind of match that I always used to love back in the days before European qualification and stupid transfers - Leeds as the determined, spirited underdogs. Yeah, it was backs against the wall for 70  minutes or so, but it was fantastic, with Matteo, Radebe and Duberry (no, really) playing great. And of course, Pennant's goal - what a beauty. Nicked the ball off Makalele, swivelled past three players and just lifted it nicely over keeper. I was kind of pissed off, thinking it was one of the goals of the season, only to find that Robbie Keane, Scott Parker and Diego F'n Forlan have scored better ones this weekend. Still, it was fun to see the paupers score a goal of quality while the millionaires score the scrappy one. Chelsea did look pretty good, but Mutu and Makalele didn't perform as well as they have been. And Damien Duff makes Christiano Ronaldo look like a honest, tough-as-nails player who rides challenges and would only go down if seriously injured.   *My thoughts on being twenty five - ur...., em...., I, no wait,...., erm, I have a good wrestling game now. Wait, I had Def Jam Vendetta at 24. Erm....  *Really did fuck all this weekend. Ali's family came up to go shopping for wedding dresses and 'favours'. (Companies make shit loads out of this. Get a packet of sweets, put half the packet in a 'wedding' package, call them 'favours' and sell them for three times the original price. Wankers). FYI, you lucky best men and ushers out there, the colour scheme at the mo is going to be purple/blue. I've got some Xmas shopping done, which is great. I also bought new jeans (see, really struggling to tell you about this weekend), which are the kind of jeans that say "They may look dirty, like I've been skidding knee-first in a builders yard, but I actually paid money for trousers that look like this".  *We have booked a Ceilidh band for the wedding. This will involve YOU (well, if you are invited), dancing. But don't worry about looking like a twat -every looks like a twat at a Ceilidh. Basically, the dances involve groups of drunken people and complicated dance moves that get explained for about 30 seconds before the music starts. Then, it's five minutes of people looking confused, colliding into each other and going "Hang on, we've fucked up" to the strains of Irish music. It's a good laugh, and if nothing else, you will see the majesty of the greatest intsrument ever devised - the electric violin.  *I have to echo Dan's sentiments about Old School. Yeah, it's funny, but it seems like the kind of film that has an great basis, but no real idea about where it wants to go with it. As I am bored and waiting for a laser to come in, (a laser I spent 4 days trying to align before the suppliers said "Oh, it's probably fucked"), you lucky, lucky people may get a Hulk review. I was going to do a Charlie's Angels 2 one, because of it's sheer shitiness, but I've completely forgotten the film. So, it's forgettable shit, unlike certain films (*cough*Jolie*cough*IndyJonesripoff*cough*) which are still insulting my intelligence two years after watching it.  *I want people just to get this nice image as they read on. At this very moment, copious amounts of naval man fat may be being sprayed across the bonnet of a new Audi TT.   *I nearly had a case for the A-MOL Files last night. During the middle of the night, I woke up to a noise that sounded like a wailing woman trying to bang a door down. In my true sceptical nature, I jumped out of bed, turned on the light and screamed "What the fuck!". Turned out to be the water pipes, which is a good thing, because I doubt my neighbours and Dewsbury were ready for the sight of me running away in naked terror.  *My nude, hairy body and Inno wanking in two paragraphs. Lovely.

      I'd just like to publicly berate myself for not drinking a drop of alcohol on my birthday for the first time since I was 17. Not only was it the first birthday in 8 years I have spent  sans  booze, it's also the first Saturday night I've spent in Korea not getting pissed on shite Korean beer. I guess you could say the beer in Korea makes you feel queer. Or if you're cool, you probably wouldn't say that.  So far I guess the worst thing about being 25 is you have to tick a new box on any of those questionnaires you fill in. Instead of ticking "18-24", you have to join the ranks of the early thirtysomethings with their Mocha Lattes and sensible shoes. Bastards, the lot of 'em.  Anyway, the main reason for my birthday booze abstention wasn't for a lack of opportunity to get pissed, but girl troubles. Apparently she wants me to have a great time in Korea and make lots of new friends, but she stormed off and damn near ran over my foot last friday when I told her I was going shopping after school with the librarian (who's 24 by the way). So I had to stay home the next night to clear the air, but she brought cake, so everything's cool.      Watched "Old School" last night. You know when you see a trailer for a film, and you think "Fuck me, that's just going to be the greatest thing ever!" and then you never get around to seeing it, but then you find it in the video shop and it's like finding money, but then you watch it and it's only OK? No? Sod you, then.  Buy these albums:    Less Than Jake -  Anthem   - not quite as good as their older stuff, but it's still LTJ which means it rules by default.   Thrice -  The Artist In The Ambulance   - If you're cool, like me, you'll have already had their last album  Illusion Of Safety  for over a year. But this one is just as great. Metal-punk-melodic hardcore greatness. It's almost as good as  urlLink Cumbria's finest .   NOFX -   The War On Errorism   - I've only just got this, but then I'm shit. Quite possibly the best NOFX album ever. You know NOFX always make comedy songs, like "Buggley Eyes", "My Heart Is Yearning" and "My Vagina" that are great for the first 5 times but then you always skip? Well, even the comedy songs on here are great. You can't beat a bit of "Anarchy Camp" or "She's Nubs". Genius.   Streetlight Manifesto -  Everything Goes Numb   - if you even remotely like ska music, you should get this. Best ska-punk album in years, maybe ever. Almost as good as Reggae Song or Monkey Boy (Oi Oi Oi), but since they only exist in our minds now (and dodgy video tapes), you'll have to make do with this.    Can you tell I'm avoiding work today?

Still, I've had a damn good week, so who cares.      Finding Nemo  really does rule. The Pixar chain of command now goes thus: TS2>Finding Nemo>Monsters Inc>TS1>Bug's Life (which is still great)   Take some cooked pork, dip it in weird but nice mustard sauce, wrap it in kimchi or a lettuce leaf, and eat it. Koreans like it, and you should too.   School trip next week, so I get an extra day off. Come on!   The new Blink 182 album is great. Buy it.

      *Booya! 25 years old. Man, that's old. Plus, kind of depressing when, on paper, without dressing up, my presents included a computer game, a cartoon on DVD and a kite.  (NB. This bit may be only interesting to about 2 people. Please scroll past if bored) So far, I have played 3 matches on the new Smackdown game, and my god, it rules. New stuff in this one: - Blood! - Wrestler's weights meaning something, so little shits can't pick up the big guys. - Body specific damage! This one is way too geeky for words. I played as Benoit vs Stevie Richards and basically detroyed his shoulder and back so that he had no choice but to tap when put in the Crossface. The season stuff is meant to be great, so I may 'develop the flu' in the near future, like that malingerer, Hinchcliffe.  I also have a Futurama series, Hulk and the Ricky Gervais stand-up show to watch later, as well as clothing from my sister and parents, in their surprisingly successful attempts to make me dress well.  * New sofa, byatch! Damned straight. None of this sinking in the middle stuff now. Plus, it's so big that people could sleep in our front room without developing a hunch.  *LEEDS WON!!! VIDUKA NOT LAZY!!!! Dear lord, it must be my brithday. We may or may not be about to be bought by an Arabian consortium, no-one seems to know. Ah well. Anyway, it's sure to come crashing to earth next week when we play Chelsea.  *I will inform people later of why Channel 5 Teletext is run by the biggest bunch of wankers known to mankind.  *All New Top Of The Pops on Friday. Dear God, what an amateur production. Besides, the programme showed exactly why TotPs has been losing viewers. Mystique's crappy remix single, Kylie's song which sounded like Liberty X, Blazin' Squad, Victoria f'n Beckham saying the fans get to decide which song to release and Westlife doing "Mandy" (What the fuck were they thinking? "Mandy"! I thought they wanted credibility now) - the charts are shite at the minute. Plus, promising The Darkness Xmas video and showing about 20 seconds of it does not get you on my good side.  *TFMrs made me watch Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Remember what I said about needing bad films to review...?

      God lord, I feel sorry for people in NE Asia who haven't access to great British TV and don't watch late night Channel 4 because they missed a show that had me nearly doubled over in pain laughing last night (Seriously, we're talking "first time I heard 'Unclefucker' pain). Last night was the debut of:  Garth Marenghi's Darkplace  Years ago, horror novelist Garth Marenghi ("...writer of more books than you've read...","...including 'Afterbirth', in which a mutant placenta destroys Bristol.") produced an drama series so shocking, the powers that be locked it away. Now, only years later, can it be show, with retrospective views from Garth and his producer.  Basically, this entire show was a pisstake of badly produced 80s horror and sci-fi shows - badly editted scenes, stilted line delivery, shitty hair-dos and piss-poor special effects. Absolutelty brilliant. The breaks to hear from Garth and his producer treating it as some precious masterpiece were inspired ("I don't know if Garth every had a family member or friend explode, but you could feel that scene meant a lot to him..."). If they are repeating this, you must, by any means possible, watch it.  Ah, Channel 4. With this, I may yet forgive you for Shattered. But for those fucking twins in Hollyoaks, it'll take a lot more.

      As a guide, I have also added Blue Square's odds. I was going to try and put an accumulator bet on, but they only take single bets. That means there are only a few where it's worthwhile putting some cash on.   Anyway, here's my predictions. Tell me if you agree or disagree.   Best Picture   Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (1/3) Lost in Translation (11/2) Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (12/1)  Mystic River (7/2) Seabiscuit (33/1)  Having seen a whopping one of these films, I can't really judge artistically. However, it can be presumed that since none of the other LOTR films have been nominated, the Academy, never a friend of sequels (except one. Prize for the first to name it), have probably been saving up to give the accolades to the final film.   My pick: LOTR: The Return of the King  Best Director   Peter Jackson - The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2/5) Sofia Coppola - Lost in Translation (5/1) Fernando Meirelles - City of God (12/1) Peter Weir - Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (14/1) Clint Eastwood - Mystic River (4/1)  I would go for LOTR again, especially since none of the actors involved seem no be worthy of nomination (shame for Astin and Andy Serkis). However, Hollywood tends to favour "actor-based" films when it comes to award times, so I wouldn't be too shocked if Sofia Coppola got it.   My pick: Peter Jackson  Best Actor   Johnny Depp - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (20/1) Sir Ben Kingsley - House of Sand and Fog (10/1) Jude Law - Cold Mountain (8/1) Bill Murray - Lost in Translation (6/4) Sean Penn - Mystic River (4/6)  I would love Johnny Depp to win this, but with it being a populist 'summer' movie, I can't see him winning. I would go for Bill Murray, for his years of unrewarded service. Despite Blue Square, I think Sean Penn has zero chance in the political climate ("No repeats of the Moore thing, thank you very much").   My pick: Bill Murray  Best Actress  Keisha Castle-Hughes - Whale Rider (16/1) Diane Keaton - Something's Gotta Give (5/2) Samantha Morton - In America (10/1) Charlize Theron - Monster (4/9) Naomi Watts - 21 Grams (7/1)  The nomination of Castle-Hughes is pretty cool, and would make a nice 'Anna Paquin' moment. However, I see Keaton getting the nod, with possibly Charlize Theron, who is unrecognisable in the film, as an outsider.   My pick: Diane Keaton  Best Supporting Actor  Alec Baldwin - The Cooler (5/1)  Benicio Del Toro - 21 Grams (11/4) Djimon Hounsou - In America (6/1) Tim Robbins - Mystic River (8/11) Ken Watanabe - The Last Samurai (10/1)  My pick: From what I hear, Watanabe saves "Dances With Ninjas" from becoming another Cruise-wankfest, so he must be in with a chance. Alec Baldwin has been getting great reviews though, and it would be nice for him to finally show Kim how to polish a statuette.   My pick: Ken Watanabe  Best Supporting Actress  Shohreh Aghdashloo - House of Sand and Fog (8/1) Patricia Clarkson - Pieces of April (11/2) Marcia Gay Harden - Mystic River (11/2) Holly Hunter - Thirteen (9/2) Renee Zellweger - Cold Mountain (4/7)   Since I don't see Cold Mountain picking up too many in the other categories, I would have to go for Zellweger, who apparently steals the film from Kidman. As an outside bet, go for Holly Hunter as the Academy like her.   My pick: Renee Zellweger

      Lack of updates due to a nice stomach bug over the past few days. Sorry. Still, I have finally got around to seeing The Godfather Part II and Part III. God, Part III is dull and crap.  Almsot as dull and crap as the  urlLink Hutton Report  (the link has the main report, not the full appendices. I'm sorry). Jesus, I watched a full hour of an old man slagging off the Beeb, waiting for the Blair slagging that never came. There are huge questions still unanswered (as pointed out by Boris Johnson, of all people), but I have one answered question. Hutton said there was no "third party" involved in Kelly's death....  WHO THE FUCK WAS THE SECOND PARTY?!  Later on, I'm going to come up with my Oscar predictions. Not that I've seen most of the films, but, of course, the voting tends to have nothing to do with the films either. I will say now that Sean Astin got screwed by not getting a nod for Best or Best Supporting Actor.  Just another quick Leeds one - in order to help our situation, we finally settled with Man U over the Rio deal, which was paid in installments.  We got £1.5M from them, when they owed us £3.25M. That's right, we agreed a lower price with possibly the richest club in the country (Russian billionaires aside). Marvellous.  Oh, and against all odds, Titch's stag do has been organised. According to the text from Jarratt, the day will involve us "going paintballing meal in evening". I have to say, the idea of trying to eat while avoiding being shot at sounds like fun and a happy recreation of the recent conflicts in Rwanda and DR Congo. Bravo, Jarratt.

      Yes, this is about Leeds Utd. Sorry. If it's any consolation, there will probably be no Leeds Utd stories ever in about two weeks.  From urlLink  Football365 :   James Milner's weekly wage of £2,000 works out at approximately a fifteenth of what Nick Barmby receives every Friday, and almost a twentieth of Seth Johnson's remuneration. It's also approximately £28,000 less than David Batty reputedly earns every week.  According to reports in today's press, it was Batty who led the Leeds players in their refusal to take a wage deferral to help the club avoid administration earlier this week. Those reports also go on to announce that, in a bid to bring in some much-needed cash after the players refused to help out, Milner is set to be sold.    Christ, this is getting depressing. I'm missing the Boro game on Jan 31st to select hymns and lie about my religious beliefs in Spalding, but it's going to be very interesting to hear the reaction these twats get.

      I was looking at the BFI site to settle an argument as to whether 28 Days Later had done well in the cinema or not, when I found  urlLink this page  with details on the box office returns for UK films. Scroll down a bit and you will notice:  Offending Angels                      89  That's right, the UK film,  urlLink Offending Angels , starring that guy from This Life and Teachers, took  £89  in it's theatrical release. Given that a ticket costs about £5 or more, about 17 people went to see this film. Seventeen. I get a bigger audience when I change my pants with the curtain open.  So, despite people saying the British film industry is doing well, remember for every Bend It Like Beckham and Full Monty, there are about ten Offending Angels and Mad Cows.  UPDATED: As pointed out by Wraggamuffin, cheery cheeky Cockney twat, Shane Ritchie of Eastenders and "Knobbing loads of girls behind one of Nolan Sisters' back" fame, has hit the news for being in a  urlLink flop of his own . While, you may say, "300 people, that's loads compared to Offending Angels", the film spiralled out of budget and Ritchie invested £500k of his own cash by re-mortgaging his home, all for a return of less than £2.5k. Quite frankly, when a film stars Dane Bowers, what can you expect?  Could be worse - he could have invested in Leed Utd, I guess.

      Well, just to prove reality TV is not dead, here's the full list of entrants for this years "I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here!". As you can see, it's a fine list.   Jordan    Glamour model and mother of baby who's disabilities are absolutley nothing to do with his mother getting wankered throughout the pregnancy.   Alex Best    Punchbag for hopefully-soon-dead drunk, former model   John Lydon    Sex Pistol   Peter Andre    Musician, famous for cod-reggae atrocity "Mysterious Girl", a six-pack and incredibly weedy legs.   Jennie Bond    Ex-Beeb Royal Reporter   Dianne Modahl    Athelete, definitely not a drugs cheat.   Lord Brocket    Haven't a fucking clue. Google says 'fraudster'.   Kerry McFadden    Ex-'singer', owner of moderately sized breasts (compared to TFMrs.), one half of the pikiest couple in showbiz.   Neil Ruddock    Former footballer   Mike Reid    DJ, former presenter of kids TV. Famously banned 'Relax' by Frankie Goes To Hollywood.  So, just to check, that's one genuine celebrity (Johnny Rotten), two failed popstars, two people famous for who they've fucked and one guy I've never heard of before. Marvellous. At least I know that there is fuck all reason to watch it, since the ghoulish sight of Jordan's life disintegrating for our viewing pleasure isn't really appealing.  In case you care, Ruddock will win due to his Tuffnell like personality winning over the viewing mongs.

      *On Saturday, the new Wragg-Devlin place became inhabited, and I helpfully used my minute amount of upper-body strength to shift a few boxes. So, now, Dan Wragg has a nice 4 bedroomed house in Liversedge.  On another note with my moving skills, I believe I may have the thinnest blood in the world. Not only do I produce enough blood while shaving (with a Mach 3, which is easier on the skin than most razors) to make people believe I have had my throat cut, but I got a small splinter in my palm from a drawer. Once I pulled it out, the blood just poured out over my hand as if I'd actually had a spear pierce the skin. Weird.  *Inno may not be single! More news as it comes...  *Titch and Olwen's wedding present has been bought from the gift list, which can be found from the website linked at the top, making it easy for friends in, say, SE Asia to order a present, even if they're not coming.  In news of a more important wedding (no, not that one, the one in June), TFMrs. spent a small fortune on her dress. Alas, she has to spend a small fortune again when it is ready. Bloody expensive, this wedding crap. It's all coming together now. We have a meeting with the vicar at the end of the month. All we need is a finalised guest list (Inno, "+ Guest" or named? And then don't change your mind for another 6 months) and we can think of sending out our invites. Also needed is a gift list (because someone will buy me a programmable toaster, dammit!) and a "Lad's Day Out" to Suits You or Debenham's for some outfits.  *I think I saw the scariest trailer ever for a new program at the weekend. Why does TV throw up cool stuff like Shameless and Simon Day's new sitcom, Grass, and then feel the need to balance it out with a sitcom starring Jamie Theakston and Amanda Holden?  *Leeds are currently carrying out the equivalent of "I'll have the money next week, Guv, honest. Just don't do me kneecaps yet". We have one week to find £5M (*cough*VidukaandRobinson*cough*) to see us through our inevitable plunge into Division 1. Still, Kilgallon scored. COME ON!  Three points from the Man U game this weekend (just like Watford! *rimshot*): - Ruud Van Jarratt producing the miss of the season, a header from 6" out. - Ronaldo is fucking useless, but does it in a pretty way. If he ever learns to cross, pass, shoot or run 10 yrds without falling over as if Lee Harvey Oswald has targetted him, he may be dangerous. - Wes Brown is the worst defender in the Premiership not named Roque Jr or Harte, and they are fucked without Rio.  *TFMrs., not content with spending a fortune on an outfit she'll wear once (well, maybe twice unless she starts washing up more), went out and bought her own Memory Card for the PS2 and Jak II. Nice. Jak II is great, like the original, but about 10x harder and with GTA bits thrown in. I'm glad about the hardness thing, since Jak and Daxter was the first game I could say I 'mastered' (completed 100%, got all the orbs) and was worried I would breeze through it in about 3 hours. I also must say, it's one of the funniest games I've seen in ages, with some pretty damn well written cut scenes.

      Okay, people. I will now admit to you the secret project that I have been planning. Brace yourself...       I'M GOING INTO TEACHER TRAINING     This morning, I went to a school in the centre of Dewsbury to help my application to Leeds Uni to study for a PGCE in Physics. I shadowed a teacher through her classes and sat back and observed. It was pretty much how I remembered, but I truly believe I can do it.     What was actually pretty cool today was the fact that I actually taught someone Physics! I helped a table with a problem set, and showed them an easy way to read velocity-time and displacement time graphs. It was awesome - they were doing them easily straight after! I was so proud of them. *sniff*     So, next up, I have to fill in an application form including educational references (eek) and a personal statement (dammit). Stay tuned for more news as I try to become an educator.

      *Bit quiet on here, but I notice the numbers have been rolling on. Come on, you tossers, if you're about, drop a message in one of the boxes. That includes you, Loo. It can be about anything. Hell, send me you're problems and I'll answer them for you like Claire Raynor.  *Leeds Utd. will be relegated this season. I've accepted it now - I am at piece with the idea of relegation. Quite frankly, Tottenham are shite and if we get outplayed at home by these useless twats, we have no hope. With Viduka on leave for family reasons, Matteo with a suspension coming up and injuries to Radebe and Duberry (yes, we'll miss Dubes, that's how bad it is), we have little hope of getting the results we need.  The next big issue for Leeds happens next Monday. If Leeds are not bought (at the handsome price, if the creditors take 50p for every quid owed, of £50M), they will wind up in administration. Hopefully, we can find some foolish twat prepared to take us on.  On other football stuff - the penalty that wasn't at Man U. Since the referee has admitted he was wrong and should have given the penalty, there is only one question left to ask - What the fuck was Gary "Citizen" Neville doing passing back when Shearer was floating about? Silly tosser.   *Kilroy. Couldn't have happened to a nicer slimy ex-Tory MP. Plus, I'd like the software that accidentally sends old work with important words missed out (more likely the Express added them to the column when first published to avoid his racism from being so obvious).  *Phase 2 of my Super Top Secret Project That Cannot Be Named takes place tomorrow. I will be throwing myself to the wolves, metaphorically. Expect a report.

      I like the books of James Ellroy. His fantastic gritty portrails of 40s - 60s politics, whether it be in the LAPD or the White House, mixing fact with fiction, are some of the best  noir  books you can read. His most famous novel is  La Confidential , the film version of which starred Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger and Guy Pearce. The critical and commercial success of the film means that Ellroy's books would be a prime source of material for a successful picture.  One of the best books he wrote is  The Black Dahlia . The book is based on a real murder in 1947, when the body of a girl was found in an alleyway in LA, cut in half. The book follows the investigation through the fictional eyes of a cop and his partner, two ex-prize fighters who get drawn into a seedy underworld as their invesigation and obsession with the case grows.   Searching around on  urlLink IMDB.com , I noticed that the book is now to be turned into a film by Brian De Palma. That's a good sign. He made  Scarface, The Untouchables  and  Carlito's Way , and despite  Snake Eyes  and  Mission To Mars , I have a lot of confidence he could make a very good film out of the book. HOWEVER, the two people  chosen to play two hard-bitten, committed investigators who's obssession pulls them apart, are:      JOHN HARTNETT AND MARK WAHLBERG   For fuck's sake.  Marky Mark?! Fucking hell, has the charisma vacuum run out of ill-conceived remakes to do? Hartnett? HARTNETT!? The guy who made  Pearl Harbour  watchers go "Wow, Affleck isn't the one dragging down this scene". The guy is the worst actor in Hollywood not called Ashton Kutcher and the cinematography will be fucked due to the amount of vaseline needed on the camera to hid his pock-marked skin.  This blows. This really blows.   Still, this is the world where apparently the desired casting for  The Office USA  at the moment stands at Brad Pitt for Brent and Matt Damon for Tim.

      Finally, it's looking like reality TV is coming to an end, with an Orkney god-botherer winning Big Brother and the Fat Lady singing probably ending any chance Pop Idol has of being successful again. However, since this kind of TV is cheap and cheerful, people will keep trying, no matter that the barrel bottom is pretty much scraped through ("I'm a Celebrity... III" will apparently have Peter "Mysterious Girl" Andre and are prepared to pay twice their usual fee to get Jordan to do it).  Since Channel 4 would be fucked without reality TV, they are throwing the works at the new show, Shattered, which started on Sunday. It's one of those ideas that sounds like it came directly from a brainstorming session -  "What was the main problem with BB4?" "Erm... they did fuck all and slept all the time." "I see. Would it be possible to make sure that they never sleep at any point next time?" "Brilliant!"  So, Shattered is a "social experiment", inevitably hosted, as most "social experiments" are, by Dermot O'Leary, to see how a set of people of the street react to a week of sleep depravation. The prize fund is £100,000, which reduces everytime someone falls asleep for 10 seconds. We will see the paranoia, hallucinations and emotinal breakdowns of ordinary folks as they went through the week awake.  However, watching the update last night, the whole premise fell apart. Dermot was talking to the shows psychologist and sleep expert. He asked if the contestants were in any danger. The sleep experts reply:  "Not at all. We are closely monitoring them and  sending them off to sleep for a couple of hours if needed. "  Oh yes.  So the incredible endurance feat these people are attempting has gone from "Not sleeping for a week" to "Not sleeping for a whole week, except the times when they are told to sleep". That's shit! How the fuck did this idea get commissioned? Seriously, at no point someone went "Erm, boss, if we are sending them to sleep for their own safety, isn't that undermining the program?"  It's not like I need any more excuses to hate Channel 4 at the moment (Cutting of fight scenes in the first series of Alias; Pornography: The Musical having no porn and shite songs; the addition of the family with the "sexy" Mongloid twins in Hollyoaks; BO FUCKING SELECTA; June Sarpong) but shite like this is just threatening to send me over the edge and forcibly remove the "4" button on my remote with a penknife.

      I'm off to Japan again! Going on the 23rd of this month for 8 days of snowboarding, manga porn and mooching off my ex girlfriend. Can't fucking wait. Korea's cool, but it doesn't have that "bugger me that's expensive, but still great" quality that so many things in Japan have. Plus, you kind of get sick of Kimchee after a while. Tokyo a-go-go, baby!  Speaking of ex's, a) did Inno break up with his bird?, and b) I'm 95% sure I'll be breaking up with my bird soon*. Apparently she thinks that since she's almost 30, she should be getting married and settling down soon, and that's where my globe trotting lifestyle and Chandler-esque fear of commitment don't fit the equation, and Mr Korean Bloke with sensible job and stupid haircut does.  Plus, who want's to live in Korea forever? No-one but Koreans, that's who. And this arsehole American twat who goes to bars dressed in traditional Korean costume. No really, he really is a fuckwit. I'll take a picture next time as proof.  Hmm, might edit that in a few days once the bitterness wears off. Still, I'm off snowboarding in Japan! Yay!  In other news, I got sacked as Town manager after coming 3rd in Div 3. Apparently promotion wasn't enough, they wanted the Championship. Daft twats. And I won the Vans Trophy! Arseholes, I tell ya. And Leeds came 8th, and Tottenham 3rd!! I'm sending my game back to SI, it's clearly up shit creek again.  *If you want to be anal and accurate about it, she'll be dumping me.

If I had your address, but I don't. Do you even read this anyway?   In other news, if you're bored at the reception today, sneak out and go watch Stuck On You. It's surprisingly** great.  *That's for calling me a shit, Haigh. Oh wait, Wragg's getting married this year, isn't he. Change that to "Wedding of the year, not including Dan's" ** surprising because the Farrellys' last one-trick pony movie, Shallow Hal, was a bit crap.

And it looks like  urlLink some people  will have a lot of explaining to do when they get to the Pearly Gates.  EDIT: Oops. Looks like someone has dared to question the Word of The Holy Gibson, because while the entry still exists, God's name has been stricken from the writing credits of  The Passion . Maybe it's because:  a) God didn't write The Bible (the film is based on a short story in the book) b) Mel takes quite a few liberties with the text.  Anyway, don't bother to go see it. I hear the ending is a complete rip-off of Matrix Revolutions.

      Which is the most believable version?   BBC 23/2/04  The BBC has announced it will no longer televise the University Boat Race after this year's event in March.  A statement said the BBC was sad to end its 66-year association with the event but it planned to make the 2004 race a "fitting finale" to its coverage.   It said the decision was "in light of the organisers' desire to pursue a highly commercial agenda" for the race.    The Times 24/2/04  FOR nearly 50 years the BBC has filmed every stroke, sweat and sinking of the university Boat Race — an event it could rightly call its own.  But yesterday the Beeb was overtaken in the final lengths of negotiations as ITV pulled ahead to land one of sport’s most prestigious events.   Next month’s will be the 50th filmed by the BBC, but will now also be the last as ITV has landed the filming rights for £1.75million, denting the Beeb’s already fragile sporting pride in the process.   It emerged yesterday that ITV had been secretly negotiating to poach the race from the under the noses of the BBC for five and a half months. ITV, which beat the BBC to the rugby World Cup rights, had been negotiating with Julia Lindsey, a former Saatchi and Saatchi executive who has been brought in to turn the Boat Race into a £75 million global brand.    A-MOL 24/2/04  Who gives a flying fuck? Rowers are a bunch of tossers, Oxbridge rowers are a bunch of twatty foreign tossers who get into the university on the basis that they can row a bit and the boat race is only watched by pathetic cunts who's only achievemen in life was having a father rich enough to get them into a decent university. It's the shittiest sports event in the calender and I'm fucking glad none of my hard earned license fee is going towards it, so the Beeb can concentrate on quality like Jamie Theakston sitcoms and Dom Joly chatshows.

       Hi, A-MOL   Hi, how are you? You look good. Lost weight?   Yeah, yeah, shut up. What's the major announcement?   What, you don't want me to talk about my love of Alan Smith and how right I was about Wes Brown or how shit Liverpool and Tottenham are?   Nah, sod that. No-one cares about football.   More badly-Paintshopped pictures, then?   Oi, twat! Come on!   Well, I wasn't going to tell you until after Titch's wedding, so I don't know if I should.   Right, since we're having this conversation, you're going to tell us know, aren't you.   Well, okay. But if you're first name is Dan, you probably know anyway.   No, I'm the other reader of this site. Tell me.   Okay. I'm going to be an uncle.   Dude!   I know.   Debra?   No, don't be daft. It's Joanne.   Wow. How far gone?   20 weeks. She's halfway through.   Shit! You've known for a while then?   Nope. Last week. She only found out the week before, because her doctor missed it and she 'passed' a chemist-bought test.   20 weeks, halfway through... If I do my maths...   It's a couple of weeks after the wedding she's due.   So, she's going to be huge for the wedding?   Of course. We'd hate it if I got attention for one day, wouldn't we.   Wow. Who's the daddy?   Some guy from her university. She met up with him at an old boys weekend.   Dude!   I know.   So, are we happy?   I'm actually looking forward to it now after the initial shock. I'll let my parents worry.   Wow. So why didn't you tell me before?   Because Vicki Hinchcliffe didn't know and Jo didn't want her to find out through Titch. Plus, I didn't want to distract people from the wedding, but since quite a few people know now, I might as well tell everyone.   I have shitloads of baby stuff. Does she want to borrow some?   Jo's really funny about this kind of thing. She wants all new stuff, so thanks for the offer, but no, thanks. Besides, all the new stuff will reduce the cost for the future A-MOL Jr.   Well, thanks for letting us know.   Not a problem. Are you going to continue the conversation in the Comments Board below?   Nah, fuck that. I can hardly be arsed to look at the site usually.   I know, you lazy twat.   Are you ever going to review Gigli like you said?   Patience, grasshopper. Patience.  EDIT:  Wait, I have more questions!   Come on, then.   Who am I?   What?   Who's asking the questions your answering?   Oh, it's a generic, imagined reader of the site. There are quite a few of them.   Okay. Well, how come that tosspot Wragg found out before me?   Right, this ain't my fault. I agreed not to tell me friends, but TFMrs went shopping with TFMrs. Wragg and less than 24 hours after finding out, decided to share the news. She came home and promptly told me this with the little cavaet "Don't worry - she won't tell anyone". Now, I found it a tad bizarre and downright unsettling that Pops knew but Danny did not. I felt I had to put the situation right.   Well, why did that unfaithful piece of shit Lloyd find out before me?   He's in Korea. He's almost as imaginary as you. I thought he would be unlikely to tell anyone. Happy now.   Kind of. Do you think I, the imaginary reader, may return for future articles when you need to explain a situation?   Maybe. I kind of like it. It reminds of the Pass-Notes column in The Guardian.   Cool. See you then.   Goodbye.

      Since joining b3ta, I've been trying to get better at use of Paintshop Pro so as not to embarass myself. As such, I've been looking at tutorials and stuff. This is an attempt to create a faux-3D image. This is done by creating a gif of two views of an object seperated by about the same width between you eyes and flipping between the views quickly. The viewer than has to look for a while and relax their eyes. It's not the best, but it can look pretty good. So, here's my first attempt. Opinions are welcome.     And here's an image I did this week that got the best reaction.  "Ooh, sorry class, I've put the wrong tape in..."

      I missed the Brits last night. Good job, really, becuase I think my TV wouldn't have survived the kicking I would have given it. So, according to the British Record Industry, what was the best in music last year?   British male solo artist: Daniel Bedingfield  Also nominated: Badly Drawn Boy, David Bowie, Dizzee Rascal, Will Young.    British female solo artist: Dido   Also nominated: Annie Lennox, Amy Winehouse, Jamelia, Sophie Ellis-Bextor.   Seriously, look at those lists. Did Badly Drawn Boy and Annie Lennox do anything last year? Amy Winehouse? Who the fuck is she? These are always piss-poor catergories anyway. I'm just surprised Joan Armatrading isn't listed, as she was every year throughout the 90s.   British album: The Darkness - Permission to Land  Also nominated: Daniel Bedingfield - Gotta Get Thru This, Blur - Think Tank, The Coral - Magic and Medicine, Dido - Life for Rent.   Right decision, but look at the nominations. Isn't Bedingfield's album 2 years old anyway?   British group: The Darkness  Also nominated: Busted, The Coral, Sugababes, Radiohead.   The Coral. Really?   British single: Dido - White Flag  Also nominated: Jamelia - Superstar, Mis-Teeq - Scandalous, Rachel Stevens - Sweet Dreams My LA Ex, Gareth Gates featuring The Kumars - Spirit in the Sky (Voted for by commercial radio listeners)   Proof that commercial radio is a big pile of shite. Not one of those songs is in anyway listenable (No, Inno, becuase you can wank to the video doesn't make it good).   British rock act: The Darkness   Also nominated: Feeder, Muse, Primal Scream, Stereophonics. (Chosen by Kerrang! TV viewers)   Are Muse and the Scream still going? And there are Kerrang readers who still listen to the 'Phonics?   British urban act: Lemar  Also nominated: Amy Winehouse, Big Brovaz, Dizzee Rascal, Mis-Teeq (Voted for by MTV Base viewers)   Oh fuck off, MTV Base viewers. One artist of quality nominated and the winner is a guy who came third in Fame Academy.   British dance act: Basement Jaxx  Also nominated: Goldfrapp, Groove Armada, Kosheen, Lemon Jelly.  Wow. A catergory where the one going nominee won. Lemon Jelly? That fucking "All the ducks are swimming in the water" song? That was a joke, right?    British breakthrough artist: Busted  Also nominated: Dizzee Rascal, Jamie Cullum, Lemar, The Darkness. (Chosen by BBC Radio 1 listeners)   Fair enough. JAMIE CULLUM?! Radio 1 listeners?! How is this midget Connick Jr ripoff getting on there? I blame Edith Bowman.   Pop act: Busted   Also nominated: Black Eyed Peas, Christina Aguilera, Daniel Bedingfield, Justin Timberlake. (Voted for by viewers of ITV1's CD:UK, readers of The Sun and Samsung Fun Club members)   Well, those nominations pretty much confirm my views of Sun readers and CD:UK viewers.   International male solo artist: Justin Timberlake   Also nominated: 50 Cent, Beck, Damien Rice, Sean Paul.  Beck? Ronald Fucking McDonald better enjoy this while it lasts.    International female solo artist: Beyonce Knowles  Also nominated: Christina Aguilera, Kylie Minogue, Missy Elliott.   Well, again a piss poor group, but it's interesting how Beyonce wins with only one good song and an album full of really dull, unlistenable R&B. If anyone actually ever got past that song, they'd realise she's shite.    International album: Justin Timberlake - Justified  Also nominated: Beyonce Knowles - Dangerously in Love, Christina Aguilera - Stripped, OutKast - Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, The White Stripes - Elephant.   Oooh, just guess how happy I am with this one. A double album of the best hip-hop in years; an excellent record with simple, brilliant songs showing the range of sounds possible from two instruments or a CD of a member of N'Sync doing Michael Jackson down the kareoke. Decisions, decisions...   International group: The White Stripes  Also nominated: Black Eyed Peas, Kings of Leon, OutKast, The Strokes.   ...and no-one should be beating OutKast in any catergory this year, anyway. THE STROKES?! THE FUCKING STROKES!!! There second album is shite, no-one is buying it and even the likes of the NME is starting to go "Well, erm, yeah, s'alright, but not great".   International breakthrough artist: 50 Cent   Also nominated: Evanesence, Kings of Leon, Sean Paul, The Thrills.   Jesus, it really is bad when a monotonous rapper who ain't all that is probably the deserving winner.   Outstanding contribution to music: Duran Duran  HA HA HA HA HA! No, really? HA HA HA!  So, just to remind you, last year was the year of Darkness, Busted, Timberlake and Bedingfield. And I thought the only thing the last guy had done last year was break his fucking neck.   Oh, and another b3ta.com entry.  urlLink

      Well, fuck Eidos. Let them try and live off the 'profits' of the Tomb Raider Franchise. They are releasing a Championship Manager 5, but I guess this is the way to go for Sports Interactive goodness...   SEGA Europe Ltd and Sports Interactive, a leading developer of sports management computer games, today announced a partnership granting SEGA® the worldwide rights to publish all output from Sports Interactive for the next five years. The partnership marks a significant step for both companies' plans for worldwide growth.  Matthew Woodley, European Marketing Director, SEGA Europe Ltd, added, "We are delighted to extend our relationship with Sports Interactive. We're really excited to be working with them with one of the most important PC games ever and doubly excited to be able to help them achieve their goal of worldwide distribution. Football Manager 2005 is going to be a huge hit this year and something we're going to have a lot of fun working with."    Now, get wanking!   Updated user interface  Football Manager’s user interface will look markedly different to anything that has come before. Navigation between screens will be easier, with each screen explaining what information is on offer and how to get to other, related information. Consistency between separate game elements will also be more noticeable than in previous football management games: operations such as player filtering and sorting will now work consistently throughout the game. The game’s look – which now includes a two-panel option – will also be easily customised, allowing managers to store their preferred views and to return quickly to them.   Refined game engine  Sports Interactive’s long-standing and award-winning game engine has been refined and tuned in accordance with the feedback received from fans of its previous games. For example, Football Manager 2005 incorporates more than 30 extra fields for player data, including the all-new new ‘preferred moves’.   Updated database and competition rules  As has always been the case with Sports Interactive’s management simulations, Football Manager 2005’s database and competition simulation will be as up-to-date and accurate as is humanly possible.   Pre- and post-match information  Managers will be presented with enhanced information before and after each match, to show team line-ups, injuries and tactics before the match, and lots of stats about the match afterwards.   International player news  Managers will receive information on international performances, allowing them follow their players’ careers and ascertain how they are performing at the highest level.   Cup summary news  Events which unfold in each round of all of the major cup competitions will be delivered to the manager in a news summary.   2D clips from agents  Managers are likely to receive ‘video clips’ (executed using the game’s acclaimed 2D match engine) of a player’s performances, sent to them by that player’s agent with view to a possible transfer.   Coach reports on squads  In addition to commenting on individual players, coaches will now offer their opinions on the squad as a whole, thus helping managers to decide which areas of their team need improvement.   Job centre for non-playing positions  Non-playing jobs will be advertised through an in-game ‘Job Centre’, improving the manager’s ability to hire coaches and other staff.   Mutual contract termination  Managers will be able to offer surplus players an opportunity to agree mutual contract termination, which will reduce the cost of releasing players and trimming squads.   Enhanced player loan options  Managers can now approach other clubs to offer young players on loan, a process which will make it easier to give younger players competitive experience. Also, when players’ loan periods expire, the manager will have an opportunity to extend the loan (where appropriate).   Manager ‘mind games’  Managers can click on any other manager’s name and issue a comment to the media relating to that person. The effects of these comments will see an increase in the amount of pressure surrounding title races, relegation battles, Cup ties and so on. It will also be possible to use this feature in relation to your own players, other clubs, media pundits etc.   Further Features  • Playable leagues in 43 countries. • More than 140 playable senior divisions and in excess of 100 playable cup competitions. • Reserve and junior league competitions. • More than 235,000 players and staff (from 145 different countries) with players boasting more than 120 separate attributes and non-playing staff boasting 40. • A database of more than 14,000 clubs, 3,000 of which can be managed. • Data supplied by a network of more than 2,500 researchers from around the world. • Updated 2D ‘top-down’ match engine. • Improved ‘radio commentary’. • Increased interaction with the media. • Reworked injury system. • Improved scouting system. • Improved finance module to reflect the changing face of football. • Comments when negotiating with human managers (network multi-player game only). • Inclusion of U18 Caps. • More realistic awards system.     Now, is there a scheme to give trainee teachers shit hot computers that can handle this and The Movie Game? Hopefully so.

      Jesus, what a waste of a weekend this was. Another trip shopping for clothes for TFMrs to wear to a do (Titch's wedding), missing an FA Cup game, only to then find she doesn't think she'll wear what she bought but something she already owns. I wouldn't mind, but this is the second time this has happened this year (3rd round, her work do).  The only real achievements this weekend:   Centrepieces  I have designed the centrepiece for our wedding. We are going for a glass, tealights and glass pebbles arrangement that should look pretty good, and, thanks to Swedish disposable furniture manufacturers, is relatively cheap.   Teaching Application  It's about 99.9995% done. I just need a second referee (might go for Hannah, as she knows what people want in a teacher) and to break down my course into percentage components (what a fucking daft idea). I think my percentages go 30% work, 40% Playstation, 20% hangover, 10% sending and reading e-mails (hey, remember e-mails? And don't say you now just leave comments either, you lazy twats).  No Leeds this weekend, which is good for my nerves. Of course, the highlight of the weekend:   GARY NEVILLE GOES NUTS!!!     Fantastic stuff. The three phases of the incident added together brillantly to one hilarious moment.  1) A dive so brilliantly over-the-top and mistimed that you could see Christiano Ronaldo and RVN looking away in embarrasment.  2) A temper tantrum on the floor that only comparable to one I saw a few weeks back when trying to explain to Barney Wragg that my aerosol deodorant was probably not best used in his mouth.  3) A headbutt when the referee was a mere 2 yards away, looking directly at him. Admittedly, it was Jeff Winter, so it was probably a close call as to whether he thought it was an offence or not.  This is all made the funny by the pundits going on all moring about how Neville will improve the defence with his "calm head and temperament". Brilliant, as it could also be argued replacing Wes Brown with anyone would improve the defence.  So, a whole weekend of nothing, probably to be followed by a whole week of nothing. Aren't you glad you read this and that I feel the need to keep writing?

      Al, the greatest thing about working in the school system is the holidays. I had the whole of January off, and I've just spent the last 2 weeks working only afternoons, and now I'm off again until the 27th of this month. Come on! If this job paid more, it'd be really great. Last night I almost convinced my bird we should go to Thailand for a week, but I think her innate Korean-ness will prevent her from agreeing. She's going out with that Korean bloke who wants to marry her today. Grrr. I've learned more stuff about him, so here's the 100% logical, scientific test to see who's a better catch, me or him.  Name:  Dan   Good solid name. Easy for foreigners to pronounce and spell.  8/10  Moon-Hyeong   Moon-Hyeoung? What the fuck kind of name is Moon-Hyeong? I bet you're reading it now and haven't a damn clue how to pronounce it as well, eh?  1/10  Age:  25.   Old enough to know better, young enough to name every member of the Wu-Tang clan* (*substitute any rock/rap/pop band of the last 5 years. Except Brit girl bands, those are Inno's speciality). Damn good age, 25.  9/10  34.   If there's anything great about being 34, please tell me. If you're a footballer, it's time to hang up the boots. If you're a suit, chances are you've still got another 5-6 years of kissing the boss's arse before you get a promotion. If you're a family man you'll most likely be up to your armpits in whiny brats who aren't good enough to have a decent game of football, but are more than adept at getting chocolate all over your new sofa. And if you aren't married w/ children, people think you're weird. People like me.   2/10  Drives a....  ...   I really need to sort that out. Ah, maybe next year.  0/10  A Hyundai or Kia or Daewoo.   Either way, it's Korean, and unoriginal.  5/10  On a date he'd take you:  Any manner of cool places. Take a look at this (except from  Dan Lloyd: 101 great dates 1999-2004 ): Top of the tallest building in Tokyo; all night rave in Toulouse (and getting you in for free, no less); Worst movie ever; Jazz bar whose actual idea of 'Jazz' was playing that swing album that Robbie Williams released, again and again. But the drinks were good, so sod it; all you can eat curry restaurant (what girl could say no to that); amusement park; mixed-gender hot springs (the hot springs were her idea, the mixed gender was mine). For more great dating ideas, buy my book, priced 35p from all good bookstores, and some rubbish ones*   The only thing I can't do is pick you up, and take you back home. But you could stay over, if you want.   9/10  Dinner. Or a movie. Or dinner. Or a movie. Or dinner. Or... a movie?   It's good once in a while, but.... y'know.  4/10   Total   Dan = 26/40.    Moon-Hyeong(!) = 12/40   *Soccer AM  And, in repsonse to A-Mol's last post, the answer is no:     I'd leave Dan out of any wedding pictures if I were you, Al. (Good Lord - I've gone from 'pitcher' to 'catcher' in 8 years from the look of those pics! And, nice filename on that. - A-MOL)

      Justin Timberlake. The subject of one of the most important questions of modern day life – “How the fuck did the pan scourer-haired one from N-Sync become a international megastar?” Alas, soon this question will be lost in the mists of time, because Justin is destined to join the names of Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer in the Hall Of ‘What The Fuck Were We Thinking When We Bought This?’ Fame. Why? NIPPLEGATE, and his subsequent behaviour, that’s why.     Let us go back through the mists of time to the late 90’s. N-Sync appeared on the music scene, and people quite rightly dismissed them as Backstreet Boyz ripoffs, who were in turn dismissed as NKOTB ripoffs. However, they still managed to get their name in Smash Hits and the like due to one Ms. Britney Spears, as it appeared that the young singer was seeing an old friend of hers from her days as a ‘Mouseketeer’ on the Disney Channel – Justin Timberlake. N-Sync now had a bit of fame as speculation grew as to whether or not Justin was slipping her a length or not.      Second on the right - International Sex Symbol   Alas, it was not to be on both fronts. Soon, N-Sync split and so did Justin and Britney. One was a friendly split up, one was not (lets just say JC Chase was not commenting on the relative tinyness of Justin’s dick). However, something strange happened – Justin became popular. He even managed to hook up with The Neptunes, who gave him an internationally successful album and ‘street’ cred. He worked with Nelly, giving him more success and more popularity within the urban/R&B scene. He started getting linked to attractive women. He secured a multi-million dollar contract to advertise piss-poor beefburgers. Somehow, this former Disney Club presenter and member of a pisspoor boy band with shitty hair and no discernable talent was everywhere.   Then came his previously mentioned arse-grabbing of Kylie. Fuck that the two had just performed a pathetic, completely forgettable cover version (I can’t remember the song, and I’m not that interested), HE JUST GRABBED HER ARSE!! Then, of course, came the Superbowl.     The trauma!   Now the day after committing serious mental trauma on the impressionable youth of the US of A, Justin was having a bit of a laugh on the radio. He said he was pleased to give people something to talk about. This was fine – let the Christian Right get all arsey for a bit, then just continue on your merry way. However, the force of the criticism was bigger than a lot of people expected. Janet Jackson was banned from the Grammies. A former member of N-Sync was banned from a TV show for no other reason than he was once in the same group as Justin. Britney Spear’s video was blacklisted, meaning it could be only played after 9pm because of it’s ostentatious sexuality. So, Justin did the only thing he could do – go to the Grammies and apologise.  And now, his career is fucked.  You see, Justin went on TV and apologised in his normal, properly educated voice. This is not the voice you had been hearing for the past couple of years from him – he had previously adopted a black-like, slightly slurred accent. Why change his voice? He said he wanted to ‘distance (himself) from the incident’ which left him “shocked and appalled” – i.e. it wasn’t his fault. So, who’s fault was it? Janet’s? The same Janet Jackson who had been initially barred from the award ceremony, unless she apologised. In the eyes of many viewers, this middle-class white man was trying to distance himself from the black woman who had dragged his name through the mud.  Timberlake’s credibility disappeared the moment he said “Sorry”. He exposed himself as a ‘white boy playing black’. There is nothing wrong with that in itself – Eminem has had a lot of success and has proven himself as an excellent rapper. However, Justin has proved himself to be just ‘playing’. Would Eminem ever go on TV and apologise for such an incident? Of course not – he’d tell everyone complaining where to stick their lawsuits and include a verse about it in his next album. Justin has shown what a little bitch he is, crawling on his hands and knees to beg forgiveness, which isn’t going to go down well with Neptune and Nelly fans. The song he performed at the Grammies? A version of “Senorita” – a song that is more latino than the urban music that he made his name with.  Timberlake has lost the support of a big fan base and will have problems convincing many producers to work with him. He will have to find a way to reinvent himself so that he can achieve the same levels of success that he’s had before.  He should ask his ex just how easy that is.

It is important to inform you that as civil servants, we are forbidden to operate a foreign account; that is why we require your assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows: 70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.   The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an accountant with the Ugandan Athletic Federation (UAF).

      Twenty years ago, I saw my first football match. I can tell you the following facts about that game: Leeds Utd. were at home against Huddersfield Town in Division 2 and Town were wearing pink shirts. That’s it. You read biographies where people can tell you the team, the subs, the time of the goals and the attendance. I haven’t a clue. That day was about spending time with my dad and two uncles (it may have been a Boxing Day match – again, I’m not sure), although there may have been an ulterior motive. I distinctly remember my father trying to explain that the game he was going to be important because it could mean that Leeds would be at the top of a big list of team names when I was very young.  As you will know from reading this site, there are times that I absolutely despise football. Why do I pay a small fortune to follow a team that is likely to be turned over nearly every week? This isn’t the first time I’ve done it – the year of the Wilkinson/Graham handover bore some of the worst matches you are ever likely to see (Leeds scored 5 goals less than Alan Shearer that season and named eight recognised defenders against First Division Portsmouth in the cup). The year before, I travelled to London to watch Leeds be destroyed by a striker that the next year the fans would hound out of the club (Funny story – went to school the next day, knackered and depressed from the trip. Becky Smith saw more and asked what was up. When I said “tired from travelling”, she said, with the biggest grin on her face “Oh! I watched it! You’re team are REALLY shit!” Cunt). This also being the same year that our strike force for one match was 36 year old Lee Chapman and 36 stone Tomas Brolin, our record signing. The year after winning the League, I watched a team that didn’t win away all season, while a player our manager decided wasn’t suitable for our side went across the Pennines and led his new team to their first championship in decades. I got my first season ticket the year that we nearly were relegated to Div 2. I have seen players brought in on small fortunes only to be reduced to the level of journeymen while seeing our exciting young players move on for a pittance. I’ve seen managerial and boardroom decisions perplexing in their stupidity. And yet, I go.  I hate the way that I have missed days out and parties to go to an open-air stadium in the drizzle and watch a match that I have known for weeks will be abject and depressing. I hate the look on TFMrs’s face when I explain I can’t go see her family because I have to go see Middlesbrough in action. I hate the way that I will not talk to people in pubs when a game is on because I need to consider the tactical implications to the game caused by the substitution of Zoumana Camara for Michael Duberry. I hate how a game against Arsenal can leave me in a horrible, aggravated mood for a week.  So, why do I follow Leeds and subject myself to this crap?  Because thrashing the worst team in the league, meaning that for two weeks we are not the bottom team, despite having a depleted squad and the likelihood of administration in a few weeks time, is one of the best fucking feelings in the world. Christ, I even love Viduka this morning.

       urlLink AL Kennedy in The Guardian   Now, admittedly, when I get worked up, I tend to raise my FPS ("Fucks" per sentence) from the normal level of 2 to about 5 to show that I'm angry. Fuck that, I say, I'm just going to try and emulate stuff like this from now on.    Well, I've been having a Dyke of a time - oral surgery, stitches, swelling, antibiotics - all the fun a Calvinist could wish for. And when you look like Barbra Streisand after three weeks under water and your pain relief is preventing you from tying, or even recognising, your own shoes, then you're in the perfect condition to stay at someone else's house and watch cable TV.  So now I finally have a proper grasp of what's important in modern life. And mainly it's tits - big tits, cheap tits, posh tits, Germans pan-frying tits with their consent, plastic tits, real tits, squint tits, famous tits and the unfortunate tits of strangers. If I'd known how fascinating tits were I'd have spent quality time with mine much more often. But if tits don't do it for you, I've seen more arses in these last weeks than I would have if I worked on an arse farm. Why do arses matter? Well, I'm still unsure, but I think it's because you can siphon the fat up out of them, then inject it back into your face.   Never mind the rollingshite news channels and their inability to notice when EVIL IRAQI DEATH DRONES WILL RAIN HORROR ON AMERICA IN MINUTES turns seamlessly into "WMD-related programme activities". They're just really happy that Mr Bliar - in all good faith, with an open and Christian heart and not a naughty thought in his head - accepted and promoted "intelligence" that professionals were loudly finding laughable long before the first coalition cluster bomb liberated the first Iraqi child's fingers.   No, let's get into some proper journalism about Hitler - Hitler's arse, Nazi arses, Hitler's plans to inject Aryan arse fat into plucky British lips, Hitler manipulating the media, creating a climate of fear, claiming draconian emergency powers and pre-emptively invading well-endowed countries in order to strip them of their wealth. Or maybe not that last one - a bit irrelevant.   Because I am now completely up to speed on the vital issues of the day. Is your sofa new enough? Are your teeth white enough? Is there enough fat in your arse to inflate your head in case of emergency? And are you spending enough? Because if you're only spending what you've got, that's not enough - you need to be IN DEBT. Not just a little bit overdrawn, I mean proper, wake up screaming, selling your underwear, Russian roulette in Soho basements to win back your kidneys debt.   Because we're going all out to reproduce the US economic miracle and you must play your part. Bush lowered interest rates, cut taxes for the super rich, slashed social programmes and solved his nation's problems. Cataclysmic borrowing, soaring unemployment and homelessness, soup kitchens, bankruptcy, increased racial segregation and collapsing access to medical care and education are all signs of a healthy economy; and Gordon Brown is so confident that Britain will thrive just as spiffingly under a Bush-style regime that he nobly helped keep the PM in place, ensuring Tony will be in charge when the arse fat hits the fan.   But because many important people's money is slightly theoretical and much of the profit Operation Iraq Rip-off was to make hasn't quite materialised, it's important for you little people to support the economy by paying to borrow more money than you can manage. And if your loans are out of control, take out more loans to cover your loans. Above all, don't save - and don't wonder why you'd only get 0.04% interest and a free tea towel if you did save, when you pay out 25% for borrowing.   And the best thing to spend your money on? A car. A large car. A 23 yards to the gallon, 12ft wide, 40ft long unparkable multisportsperson luxury carrier turbosystem. Leave the engine running while you nip into the house for a bath, stoke on those revs at the lights, drive for fun, drive for friendship, drive as a hobby and, instead of sex, climb into your surrogate orgasm, your sad excuse for a life, and burn petrol, no matter what.   We have a fossil-fuel economy. Fossil fuels mean power, all kinds of power. We are running out of fossil fuels. But we must not save them, we must not seek to replace them with sustainable alternatives, we must not think of reversing transport policies based on suicidal levels of self-indulgence, we must consume. Don't love your kids, don't worship God, don't talk to your partner, just jump into anything with an engine - you've got to justify every drop of blood spilled by US and UK foreign policy. Don't think of mercy or justice. Don't think of the dead. Just think of arses, think of tits.

      God knows what's going on at the moment. We broke up because she said we'd be better off just being friends, and since she definitely wants to get married this year (and has a Korean bloke who does want to marry her), and I don't (get married in 2004? Talk about hopping on the bandwagon), I reluctantly agreed. Fast forward to last night, I've got the comfort food in and Road to Perdition on DVD (bought for less than a fiver. It's great here, I tells ya). Get a call from her, end up meeting her, she suggests we have a few drinks, and before I know it, I'm making her breakfast* in the morning. Important facts to note:    So yeah, there's this Korean guy who's asked her to marry him. They're not going out though. Weird? Too fucking right. Anyway, during the conversation she points out that if she had to choose between me and him (ie. if we both wanted to marry her), she'd pick me. I almost certainly don't want to, but it's nice to know I have options.  Korean fried chicken is fucking awful. You know in England, you can choose between leg, breast and wing? In Korea they chop the whole fucking bird up into manageable pieces, fry it up and serve it. I think they take off the head and feet, but that's all. Nothing like biting down on a piece of fried chicken, followed by the satisfying crunch as the poor bird's neck snaps in two. There's sod all meat on that bit as well. Bastards.  Went to karaoke after drinking. The English selection is pretty limited, so I sang some weird stuff, including Jeremy, Hungry Like The Wolf (which I made my own in Japan), Paranoid Android (!), Bohemian Rhapsody, Dope Nose (rocks), and *cough* Bryan Adams  Haigh, you're right. Charlie's Angels 2 really is a travesty. Watched about 40 minutes of it before realising "Hey, this fucker has no plot, it's just 5 minute clip after 5 minute clip of the angels in different outfits with some awful action/comedy/dance routine going on". (The opening bit? Terrible) And the first one was so good as well! God only knows how they managed to rope Bruce Willis, John Cleese and Owen Wilson into doing cameos. I bet Bill Murray** pissed himself when he saw it.   *making her breakfast  = offering her a spoonful of my Sugar Puffs, and her eating all my biscuits while I was in the  shower  ** All-time favourite Bill Murray moment from a movie: -Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here. -Is this true? -Yes, it's true. This man has no dick.

      Who didn't see that coming?  And no, it wasn't because of infidelity (not MY infidelity anyway). It's complicated and I can't be arsed to go into it. Can't feel too bad about it though.  Anyone watch the Grammys? They're quite crap, but they make the Brits look like a school disco. The best bits were:    Prince!!! And Beyonce in short skirt! Together!   Celine Dion's mic didn't work, and when she got a replacement, she ruined the atmosphere of the song (a tribute to Luther 'stroke' Vandross) by tapping her mic about 5 times to check it was working. Daft bint.  Outkast. Of course.  Black Eyed Peas and JT. Timberlake's own performance was nothing special, because he chose the worst single from his album (Senorita - shite).   Foo Fighters played with some jazz pianist. Sounds crap on paper, but it worked pretty well. Funny just to see Dave Grohl headbanging to a piano solo.  The White Stripes were OK as well I suppose  The other 2 hours and 30 minutes were dull though. Coldplay got 'political', Justin apologised for getting Janet's baps out, and there was a nice long rant about how we're robbing the music industry by downloading music for free. Din't have much impact though, considering every pop star was decked out in a designer outfit, fresh from their Beverly Hills mansions.   The bird in my picture is Chie. Nothing happened with her. Scout's honour.  Does anyone have pictures of the Stag do? I'm guessing Al didn't risk taking his camera out for the night. I haven't lost my wallet in 6 years, by the way.

       urlLink Eddie Gray says David Batty will never play for Leeds again.   While all I have heard of this so far is in the above story, I have to say that Eddie Gray should take his under-qualified arse to the retirement home and fucking stay there. Yes, he may be a Leeds legend, but all that should entitle you to free home match tickets.  Eddie and Batty haven't got on since Gray told both O'Leary and Venables that Batty didn't have the fitness left to play in at the top level. However, the moment Eddie got paid off when El Tel's Reign Of Terror ended, he was recalled by Peter Reid and showed that he could easily make the likes of Seth Johnson and Paul Okon look like the overpaid bags of shite they are.  There were rumours of a rebellion by "senior players" when Eddie got given the caretakers role, and it was probably led by Batty. Overall, it has to be said that for all Gray's talk of commitment and wanting to help, he really has achieved little and his record in charge is worse than Reid's. And, if we want commitment, who the fuck is more likely to get the team going and get the fans behind them - David Batty or Jody Morris?  David Batty is my favourite ever player, and I am fucked off that Gray and Venables before him have treated him like this. If he never plays again - Cheers, Dave, and thanks for the memory.  UPDATE: "Part of my decision is due to us reverting to 4-4-2, like we did on Saturday against Villa" - EG. This just in - Aston Villa 2, Leeds 0, you senile twat.

      -Well, another Sunday, another fucking ridiculous hangover. At least this weekend, it was in a good cause – Titch’s stag do. Plus, thanks to the day’s activities, I had other pains to help me through the day.  First up, we went paintballing in Bradford. After Titch finally arrived, we ended up with 13 players (Me, Titch, Jarratt, Inno, Wraggamuffin, Dave Benson, two of Titch’s mates, Olwen’s brother and four fifteen year old kids who happened to come in at the same time) split between two teams and went off into battle.  Straight away, I noticed two problems which would limit my success: Glasses, which constantly steamed up I wasn’t on the same side as Dan “Rambo” Wragg and Dave “Columbine Student” Benson  The first game really set the standard for my day. I was blinded within 30 seconds due to a shot to my visor (not a kill shot). I then went forward blinded and ended up surrounded. After a shot to my arm, I stood with arm and gun in the air (the single for “I’m dead, don’t fucking shoot me”) and, of course, took about ten shots in the chest, back and arms. Twats.  Pretty much, our team got twatted, to the point that the two fifteen year olds on our side got shellshock and spent two games just hiding in the base before sitting out the last free for all game.  Well, after all of this, I will now give you  the A-MOL guide to being shot.    If I were shot, I would rather be shot…  …in the calf. While trying to move forward in the Capture The Flag game, I went to slide across an opening where I knew there was a shooter, due to Jarratt getting taken out approx. 10 seconds in. I nearly made it, but realise the small bump on the back of my leg meant I was out. I almost didn’t notice it.   If I were shot, I would rather avoid being shot…  …in the sternum. The last game, someone shot me right in the middle of the chest. It practically knocked me off my feet and I was breathless for a good half a minute.   The worst way to avoid being shot is…  …to approach a blind corner where Rambo and Columbine Student are waiting, firing blindly at them, and then screaming “Don’t shoot, I’m out of paint!” while curled up in the foetal position as they fire back.  And then it was into Leeds for a meal at Chris D’s Restaurant, Brio. It was a nice meal at quite a reasonable price, only ruined by the fact that that Ginger Bo Selecta Twat was on an opposite table. The sight of the fat dwarf was nearly enough to put me off my Penne Arribiata, but not quite due to spending the day running about like a cunt in an overall.  To be honest, I don’t remember much of the bar crawl, but I remember padlocked pants, giving my coat to a couple of girls who’d gone out semi-naked in zero degree temperatures, Uriah Rennie is a twat and a bloke getting his cock out and waving it in people’s faces. Dan Wragg also tells me that there were midgets involved. I also managed the Lloyd-esque achievement of losing my wallet. Luckily, the taxi company had it.  So, Sunday involved me sleeping until two, eating a packet of paracetamol and finding bruises from paintballs all over my body. I have about five on my scalp, which with a hangover, made washing my hair a fun experience. No Gigli – there’s only so much my body can take.  -[insert Leedsshit macro here]. I will say this, though – Lloyd, I am right about them missing Rio. The minute they play a team that can defend, Wes Brown is going to be exposed as a useless little shit.   There was a nice football story this weekend – Oldham Athletic. After nearly going out of business, they had “Celebration Sunday”, in which the new owners let everyone in to the game FOR FREE to say thanks for their support. The Oldham players responded to this by winning 6-0. Nice one.  -Because I'm bored, and felt like a good ol' stereotypical Japan joke...      Is it just me, or does it look like Dan is the part that's been added to the pic?

When the sky's clear, you can see all the way to the Sea of Japan. Purrty.    There's a big Buddha in Kamakura (place famous for all kinds of Samurai stuff. I bet Tom Cruise has been there). It's over 800 years old and made of bronze. This is it.    Nice picture of random bridge in Kamakura. I don't know why all these small pictures look blurry, they look badass on my computer. But I don't want Mole moaning that his site takes 15 minutes to load up.    It's a temple. We saw a lot of temples that day.

      Fancy an update on my miserable life? Well, I got 15 minutes to kill before class, so sure ya do.    I've been avoiding Bird No.2 (not random) for the last few days. She's sent me a couple of texts, but I ain't replied. Evil.  The other one gets back from Seoul today. She said she'd call me, but that was on Monday before we had a big text-message-based argument. Hmmm.   In the meantime, I've been experimenting with isolation after work these past 2 nights. Not bad, especially when you have Simpsons and Friends on TV every night, and Finding Nemo on DVD.  5 against 5 in the poll, although I voted no for me, so really it's 5 v 4. Bugger.

      So, what kind of film makes a man cheat on his girlfriend with a girl in a booth? Well, according to the assorted film critics of the US, as collected by  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes , THIS kind of film!   "The worst big-budget science fiction disaster since Battlefield Earth. And at least you could laugh at Battlefield Earth."  "Getting right to the crux of the matter: You can’t keep a straight face and be frightened by an alien that crawls out of a human being’s anus."  "While the movie is fairly unpleasant it's also, finally, so ludicrous that you begin to wonder if it isn't all a big put-on."  "Kasdan and co-screenwriter William Goldman clearly had no idea how to turn King's lengthy book into one coherent movie, so they decided to make several incoherent ones, hoping something will stick."  "Stupid, sophomoric and moronically silly, it leaves you with the feeling that you might welcome shock treatment just to get your brain back."  "Two words: anal leakage."  "It bores, it flabbergasts, it sickens, it confounds, it confuses, and it hurts. I challenge you to name a movie with a more convoluted or preposterous storyline."  "An unintentionally hilarious film that could have been called 'Anal Worms from Space'."  "An early X-Files episode did everything 20 times better."  "I knew there was a reason I stopped reading Stephen King stories"  "As stupid as stupid can be."   I've decided - one weekend I'm going to spend about £40 at Blockbuster and watch the worst films I can possibly find.

      Because I watched it on DVD last night and my boss is off work...      X2   Ah, Marvel films. After years of letting any goof with a camera come along and rape their creations, they decided to let decent directors and actors have a go. Following the lead of DC and Warners’ Batman, directed by Tim Burton with Jack Nicholson hamming it up (before letting Schumacher ruin it with Batman and Robin. Saw that last week - you might get another M:I2 style review), and the unexpected success of Blade, they started productions with some of the best directors working in Hollywood. Spider-Man got given to Sam Raimi, acclaimed horror director trying to find credibility in the mainstream. Ang Lee decided to follow up Oscar winning Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with Hulk. Before these two however, came the most intriguing – Bryan Singer, director of The Usual Suspects, was to be given X-Men.  There is a lot that can go wrong with X-Men. It is a beloved franchise, and unless you get the tone just right, the film could fall apart and you’ll have a lot of comic fans ready to gut you – well, if the fat bastards could run after you, that is. Then came the casting news – Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. Perfect. Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto. Wow – unexpected, but wow. Halle Berry as Storm. Okay. Famke Jansenn as Jean Gray. Nice. Wolverine – some bloke from Oz who was in Oklahoma in the West End. Wha…?  The first X-Men came and it was a success. It wasn’t true to the comics in chronology and characters history, but captured the tone of the comic perfectly. Even if the plot was a simplistic “Bad guy has machine, must stop machine” story, the film appealed to fans and to those with a passing knowledge of the franchise from those cartoons in the middle of Live and Kicking. With the success came the inevitable sequel, but could the film match the raised expectations of the fans?  X2 starts a few months after the first film. Magneto is jailed, the school is returning to normal after the fight against him and Wolverine is looking for details of his origins. However, a series of events starts with an attempted Presidential assassination by a teleporting movement. An Army Commander with knowledge of mutants is given power to capture Xavier and close down the school. The mutants are soon separated, leaving a handful to rescue their colleagues and join forces with an enemy to defeat a common threat.  Holy crap, what a film! This is the first time in years that I came out of a film filled with pure unadulterated joy. With the characters and themes of mutant oppression set in the first movie, Singer can now construct a storyline that can go further into ideas as no other comic based movies has before (Note: watch the X films and Independence Day replacing “mutants” and “aliens” with “Muslim”. Modern day American foreign policy in one easy shot). This has all the action scenes that will sate anyone who desires it (the White House assault, the attack on the School and a fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike are all brilliantly done) but is also a great character piece. The pace is the film is well handled, managing to pack in a lot while feeling a lot shorter than it truly is.  Every single member of the cast deserves praise. The old hands, Stewart, McKellen and Brian Cox, play this with all the sincerity of a Shakespeare play and it works. Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine is, again, a brilliant portrayal of what could, in the wrong hands (*cough*DougrayScott*cough*), have been a 2D character. However, Jackman gives Wolverine menace, but also a layer of compassion for the younger characters he has to fend for. The scene between him and Cox’s Stryker is wonderful, as Wolverine realises that the answers he’s been searching belong to his enemy. The cast from the first film look more comfortable with their roles and play them perfectly – Halle Berry doing a credible job of righting the many wrongs of Storm in the first film. There are great performances from characters that’ve been upgraded - Pyro, coming from ‘extra’ to ‘evil little shit’, being a standout. The addition of Alan Cummings’ Nightcrawler is another plus, bringing life to a character that could have easily come off as ridiculous.  Are there flaws in this film? Of course there is. While Halle Berry is better in this in the first film, it often feels that her role has been given more today for the sole reason that she won an Oscar and deserves a bigger part. Cyclops, the supposed leader of the X-Men, is relegated to the point that he is missing for over an hour of the film. Magneto is played wonderfully in “shades of grey” for most and the film, but then turns into a “black and white” bad guy at the end, having to commit an EEEEVIL act at the end when it would probably have worked better to have had him save the day. But, fuck it. When a film is as much fun as this and doesn’t treat people who’ve paid for a comic book based film like complete morons, finding these faults seems like nitpicking. This is one of the best films I’ve ever seen.  Oh, and of course, those with knowledge of X-Men bordering on ‘sad wanker’, the last shot means that X3 may be even better.   5/5   On another note with this film, here’s a question. Why isn’t a film like this considered for Oscars? Yes, it’s an action film based on a comic, but some of the performances in this rival many of those that are nominated and even win. Hugh Jackman’s performance is brilliant, and if Depp is worthy of nomination, why not Hugh? Ian McKellen, a previous winner, could easily be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor award, especially as Tommy Lee Jones won for The Fugitive. Why the snobbery that an action film can’t be nominated, but long, tedious tosh like The English Patient and complete wank like Titanic get the honours, fooling people into believing that these films are worth watching?

      What is it about Huddersfield Town and their obsession with selling off their best strikers? First Boothy pissed off to Sheffield Wednesday, only to return later half the player he was, then Stewart buggered off and subsequently won Ipswich promotion almost single-handedly (and pissing on Town's dreams of Premiership football). Then Delroy was sold off halfway down Town's slippery slope to the glitzy and glamourous world of Third Division football, and now, with Town in 5th place and hoping to bounce back, they sell Jon Stead to Blackburn. From what I can understand, they've already balanced the books by getting rid of all their old expensive shite (Martin Smith, Adie Moses, Ben Fucking Thornley). So why do they need a million pounds now? Are they hoping to wave it in front of Elland Road in an attempt to attract Leeds players? Shite. Shite, I tells ya. They'll be festering away in Div 3 for a good while, and they'll piss the million away on the upkeep of the McAlpine, because crowds of 5,000 ain't going to do much.  I may be in Korea, but I'm still pissed off about this.

      I was just going to make a small comment on one of the boards, but I want to get this down so I can just recall it every time it comes up in conversation. Here goes…   Mission: Impossible 2 is just a piss poor film made for the soul purpose of giving Tom Cruise something to wank over while he’s waiting for his new mirror to be delivered because the old one is useless due to the layers of dried spunk on it.   It should have ruled. The first film is pretty good, with nice, logical action, a tight plot and a great cast. Then we hear John Woo will direct the second film. Fucking A. However, this just became one of the most tedious films (apart from, of course, that of Cruise abomination, Eyes Wide Shut) I have ever sat through. Here are my issues:   It’s not Mission: Impossible  M:I, the original series and film, were based around a group of agents who used their skills to perfection to carry off a mission, like in Ocean’s Eleven, but smoother. For this mission to stop a deadly virus that could wipe out millions, they send Tom for disguises, Ving Rhames (who has no other role than drive a copter and go “Yessum, Mastah Tom” when required), a hacker and a non-agent midget thief. If this guy was a real threat, send in a fucking huge team with useful skills and a decent plan. The job is to stop him getting the virus – WHY NOT SHOOT THE CUNT IN THE HEAD?!   Tom Cruise: Action Wank  William Shatner directed Star Trek 5, a film that is constantly ridiculed due to him adding a scene where Shatner climbs a cliff for no reason than to show that he is a manly man’s man. So, of course, the best idea is to resurrect this scene at the very beginning of this film. Why is he climbing the cliff? To show what a manly man’s man Tom Cruise is, that’s why. And how come Ethan Hunt has decided the best way to twat people is not his fast, hard, no thrills method, as in the first film, but now goes for spin kicks and ridiculous jumps? Because it shows what a manly man Tom Cruise is. He’s not gay, y’know. That fucking fight at the end with the motor bike was stupid, pointless and incredibly pedestrian for a Woo finale, but hey, didn’t Tom look good.   The Cast.  Jesus. Thandie Newton was cast for no other reason than she is 4ft 10in, making Tom Cruise look like The Big Show in comparison. Notice she’s never had a success since? And how I praise The Lord that Dougray Scott ripped his knee in a manly man’s man fight scene so he had to give up the Wolverine role. This is the blandest cast ever assembled for an action film. Except, of course, for Anthony Hopkins, who is in it for about 5 mins (and technically shouldn’t be in it at all, because M:I operatives never meet their bosses).   Plot? We Don’t Need No Stinking Plot!  Q: Why did Dougray leave the agency and turn evil? How does he know of this virus that a top intelligence agency has never heard of? Why did Thandie leave him? Why do they need ‘top thief’ Thandie, when she does a basic steal that manly man’s man Tom could have done? How can an international jewel thief screw two agents without being investigated and captured? And why is Thandie so moralistic for a thief? Why does the top manliest agent in IM keep making stupid mistakes that keep endangering the missing?  A: Erm, well… Hey, Tom did his own stunts! What a man! He didn’t shag that gay porn star, you know.  Basically, it’s a shit action film, but because we see “CRUISE” in big letters on the poster instead of Wahlberg or Statham, we’re expected to go ga-ga for it.

      OK. I'd just like to say that I'm 100% not proud of myself for this, but I wanted to get this off my chest and say that if I spend the rest of my time in Korea alone and hated by most of the female population, then I've got sod all reason to complain.  I've cheated on my bird twice. In the last 4 days. With 2 different women.  Christ, that looks bad written down. Anyway, for what it's worth, here's my defence:  1) Bird pissing me off beyond belief by not answering calls / replying to texts on the Saturday and Sunday after I got back from Japan (the only excuse I could muster out of her? "I was busy") AND calling me yesterday morning just to say she was off to Seoul for a 3-day shopping trip with her sister. I spent 30-odd quid on quality Japanese merchandise and duty-free perfume as presents to her, expecting a warm welcome back to Korea, only to be mercilessly shunned. *quiet sobbing*  2) The first time was with my ex in Japan. In my defence  - rules of Road Trip, plus the fact that we were still a couple for 4 months after I moved back home, so it's kind of like back pay.  3) The second time was yesterday in a DVD room (like a private cinema / video shop where people (usually couples) go to watch movies / fool around). I wouldn't have done anything, but we were watching Dreamcatcher, which starts off great, but the last 40 minutes is so full of shit that you'll do anything just to pass the time. It must be the first time that the adding of Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore to a movie actually makes it shitter.  So, your honour, although the opening sentence does indeed make me sound like an arsehole, based on the above evidence, I'm pleading not guilty on the charges of being a bastard.

      but I'm doing it anyway.

Why is it funny? Stick it in  urlLink  here  (French to English) and giggle.   The French  -they're not all bad. Good slogan for the tourist board, that.

      Only people who a) speak french and b) have seen  Taxi 2  will find the title funny, but I don't care.   Japan: It's still the best country you haven't been to (unless you're me, or Tit n' Ol). Managed to spend 120 grand in 7 days (that's yen, mind). Things of note:    Japanese porn - they blur out the beaver and cock, but you can tell it's real. All the girls are 19 but look 15, and every scene ends with either a pearl necklace or a salty mouthwash. And Japanese girls squeal like chipmunks when they get excited. I should have known that already, mind.  Soup in a drinks can, served hot from a vending machine - it rocks and you know it.  Thank God for the rules of Road Trip (and to a lesser extent, Friends), especially when visting ex girlfriends who like dressing up in nurses' uniforms*.   Snowboarding still rules. Skiing's for puffs and Navy boys.   Battle Royale 2's out on DVD now. I didn't get it, because the bastards didn't put English subtitles on the Japanese release. Selfish gits. And the new Final Fantasy looks well worth a tug or two over.  I'll post pictures when I can be arsed. (Not of Point 1., you sick freak. I'm worried if you have pictures of Point 2. and Point 3. is probably on the same dodgy ground as 1.

      * Leeds and Wes Brown shit, Henry a bit good, yadda, yadda. The only interesting thing to happen this weekend in football was a very hairy Ian Walker twatting a fat Leicester fan who came on the pitch. Oh, and conceding 5 goals in 18 minutes.  * Not much happened this weekend to be honest, as I was down in the middle of nowhere, but we have a time for the wedding now. It will be at 3pm.  We also may have a bridal car in the form of a Jazzy B-MW.   * I have completed most of my GTTR application form to go to Uni, but I need two more things - a personal statement on why I want to become a teacher and a second referee, who can be anyone who knows me well and is a good judge on my suitability to teach. Looking at it carefully, there appears to be no reason why I can't get a good reference from a Manager of Marks and Spencers' in, say, Halifax...  * So, just to make sure.... Everyone heard about Jordan's affair with a married footballer, that she will dedicate a chapter to in her forthcoming autobiography, and the completely unconnected story that David Beckham is allegedly seeking legal action to stop his name being sullied in a forthcoming book? EDIT: Oh, fuck it, everyone has because she said it on Saturday night TV and it's on the front page of The Sun. Finger on the pulse, me.

      In case you, the reader, want to check out b3ta, here's a guide to b3ta injokes, so you might understand, if not enjoy.   “Woo/ Yay/ Houpla / Panowie”  – Think of these as like a 4 star grading system for pictures. If it gives you a giggle, a “Woo!” is sufficient. If it’s a full on belly laugh and you immediately e-mail if off to mates (the picture “goes viral”), it should get a W/Y/H. If it’s one of the greatest pictures ever, it gets the lesser spotted ‘panowie’   “Fluff”  – Fluff is generally cute pictures (i.e. Kittens in bunny suits and such). Fluff is greatly appreciated.   “Seamless”  – Started as an insult, now often seen as affectionate, the shout of “Seamless” is used when you can blatantly see the cut-out bits of the image.   “Fwap”  – the noise one makes whilst wanking. Often associated with pictures of breasts.   “The Uplaod Codez”  – a bastardised version of a post from a newbie, who posted on the board, apparently not knowing what the board was for, and asking “Were are the music uplaod codez?”. The term is new used to discourage txt and h4X0r speech by mocking the user of such.   “Bandwagon”  – an image/ theme that is constantly posted by various users with little alteration from what has gone on before. Often causes pain and annoyance (see – Saddam as Santa, iPod advert parodies)   Memes  – included on  urlLink this site  are popular images that can be recycled. Many have meanings, such as…    “Quo”   – A picture of Status Quo laughing is used to symbolise a disaster or accident.    “The Fear”   – A weird two-headed gif file, which symbolises fear.    “Is it real?”   – A picture of a shark attacking a helicopter. Due to the number of people asking if it is an unaltered image, it’s become synonymous with checking if a image is real or not. (“Is that picture real?” “No shark, no bridge, so… No”)   Swearing  – use of swearwords is frowned upon, unless you can be imaginative with it. Popular versions are “twunt” (combination of two words meaning the same thing) and “Cock off”. e.g. “Oi, stop flaming and cock off, you flanging twunt”. Also used is “cranberry”, which was used temporarily when the board had a filter, to replace “cunt”.   Crudely drawn cock  – Everytime a b3tan has a new software package or new hardware, it is there duty to boast of this whilst incorporating a piss-poor knob into a picture, complete with hairy balls and a couple of spurts.

         From the  urlLink NME :   Chances of THE DARKNESS playing this year's GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL are looking slim after it was claimed the band would want £1million to play.  The figure is a far cry from the £75 they were paid to play their Friday morning opening set last year.  Today festival organiser Michael Eavis told the Daily Mirror: "It's incredible how much things change in a year."  "When we booked them last year they were just a pub band no-one had heard of. We paid them £75 but they were thrilled to be given the opportunity."  Since the appearance, which was seen to kick-start the band's massive run of success, their album 'Permission To Land' has sold 1.2million copies in the UK alone. Yet Glastonbury's good-causes remit means the festival does not pay its performers such inflated prices as other festivals.  A source close to The Darkness told the newspaper: "To play Glastonbury this year, they'd want £1million. The way they see it, they'd worked long and hard to get where they are and feel entitled to make the most of their success."   I don't care how long and hard you work, no-one is worth a 100,000%+ pay rise in a year. And no-one who graduated from Huddersfield Uni should be able to make £1million for a night's work.  In other news, these are the headliners for Reading / Leeds this year:         Is it me, or is this the most piss-poor line-up of headliners ever? Of the three, only the Darkness (who have ruled the world this past year) are truly worthy of a headlining slot (but not a million pound headlining slot, mind). Green Day, great as they are, haven't done anything worthwhile since 2000's  Warning  (they played second on the bill the following year, by the way). And the White Stripes? They could be bigger than the fucking Beatles, but 2 people on a huge stage does not an awesome spectacle make. Consider also that during the height of the garage rock revival, the Hives (surely a much more entertainig live act) were still playing in broad daylight.  Previous years have brought us geniunely huge, legendary acts such as the Beasties, Chili Peppers, the Manics, Eminem, and Metallica (before they released that travesty of a new album). 2002 was a pretty awful year for Reading and Leeds, (the Strokes / Foo Fighters / old has beens Prodigy and G n' R), but this one tops even that.  This is all redundant, of course, since we'll all be going to Danny's wedding instead of this overpriced shite.

      Things that pissed me off this past week:    (ex?) girlfriend who is definitely, 100%, absolutely certainly getting married on the 25th of next month, who called me EIGHT FUCKING TIMES last night to say very little other than "I'm lonely, I miss you, etc. etc." - pisses me off no end. I'M TRYING TO GET CLOSURE FFS!  Said GF's parents who are supposedly not rich, but have just bought a) a brand spanking new apartment for the 'happy couple'; b) thousands worth of new furniture, and c) a luxury saloon (well, luxury as far as Korean cars go) for soon to be son-in-law. He (a doctor, by the way), has bought: Fuck all. Oh, but he did tell his parents-in-law the exact model of car he wanted them to buy him. What a fucking arsehole. I'm going to punch him when I see him. Apparently he's a small guy. Twat.  Stupid Korean channel who only buy half of Friends series 10, then repeat it ad infinitum. If I see that Applegate episode one more fucking time.....  Asian cable channel I get, Star World, promises 3 hours of laughs on Monday nights. What we get is: Simpsons (hasn't been a good one in ages), Just Shoot Me (average sitcom starring David "irritating and small" Spade), King of Queens (shite starring a fat bloke, and the girl Zack Morris went out with when they all worked at the beach club), Everybody Loves Raymond (I fucking don't), Grounded For Life (crappy Roseanne-style family sitcom), and Frasier (usually good, but last night's was crap). And the episode of Enterprise they showed last week was fucking awful (engineer bloke gets knocked up by sticking his hand in a bowl of pebbles).  Lack of choice at the cinema - the only two English movies on last week were Mona Lisa Smile (I'd rather sandpaper my crotch for 2 hours) and Hidalgo, which was very very average. It's a film about horses, for cryin' out loud.  Mole's photoshopping has gone off the boil. I haven't laughed at one since the last  Ring  one, and that dog with the earphones. Sort it out*.  Bands releasing remastered, updated, or "deluxe" versions of albums I've already got. Bad Religion are about to re-release 5 of their old albums, Jawbreaker just put out "Dear You" again, and now  urlLink  this . At least Bad Religion are promising to keep the prices low, but still, Bunch of Money-Grabbing Arse and no mistake.  France winning the Grand Slam... no, actually, I couldn't give two shits. If anything, I'm happy that my "England - Wilko = shit" theory panned out.   Now, some entertainment.   urlLink  Unfortunate Acronym of the Week   Surprisingly funny:  urlLink  Photos of people taking photos   Buy me something from  urlLink here , and I'll be your best friend. It's still the funniest website on the net, by the way.   *still better than 90% of what goes on there, which is the main reason I don't like b3ta. That and all those stupid inside jokes like "A pocketful of "Woo" for you, sir", and uplaod codez. Shite, that's what it is.

         Another weekend, another shitty game for Leeds. Consdiering we could have been 3-0 up in the first ten minutes, it is kind of a pisser to lose 4-1. Viduka scored the hardest chance, and missed a fucking open goal, simultanously showing why he does and doesn't deserve £64k a week. The midfield is the main problem for us at the moment. Milner is knackered due to playing constantly all season despite only being 17, our best midfielder is an Arsenal player and the central midfield of McPhail and Johnson ain't scaring anyone (oh, for a decent, experienced holding midfielder...)  Went to the pub and watched the Arse v Scum match, which wasn't generally a great game, but had an underlying air of malevolence which made it interesting. The highlights: Wenger and Fergie screaming at each other; Henry's penalty call which managed to look like a dive, a foul by Carroll and a foul by Brown depending on the camera angle; Henry's goal; Henry looking like he wanted to twat Lauren for wasting a chance (and he apparently did twat him afterwards); the advert before the second half for Nike (mainly, when Cristiano Ronaldo grabs Roberto Carlos and says "Ole". He tries to look tough, but it actually makes it look like a scene from a gay porn film); some guy coming up to me, asking me a question along the lines of "Heh! You lar go tinder polis genby?", to which I replied "Yes", and then him pulling me over to his mates, going "He's right" and patting me on the back.   =  Generally, an absolute nothing of a weekend, except the realisation that my niece will end up costing me more than if I had a child of my own. Jo has bought it Christian Dior babygrows, for fucks sake!  =  Oh, and me and TFMrs went to the cinema and watched a DVD...      "Alright guys, I'm not gonna lie to you. This is gonna get kinda weird..."  Starsky and Hutch   Let's face it; with Starsky and Hutch, you know exactly what you are getting. A remake of an old 70's cop show, the Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson double act, Snoop Dogg as a major cast member, Todd Phillips, who's previous work includes Road Trip (great) and Old School (not so great, but still with it's moments). It's not going to win awards, but you know that it's going to make you laugh. The question is, how much?  Oh, right, the plot. It's the 70s in 'Bay City'. Uptight cop, David Starsky (Stiller) is forced to team with Ken "Hutch" Hutchinson (Wilson), a cop whose 'undercover robberies' start to look like plain ol' robberies. When a body washes up near the pier, the boys, with help from local gangster and informant, Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg), uncover a plot that seems to lead directly to a prominent local Jewish businessman, Reese Feldman.  Let's face it, the plot is largely irrelevant and the film lumbers from event to event, letting us enjoy Stiller and Wilson together. The film plays to the strengths of the two - Stiller plays the embarrassing, out-of-his depth, angry bloke (similar to Mr Furious in Mystery Men) while Owen Wilson reacts to it. It's nothing new or groundbreaking, but it works well. There are many very funny scenes, assisted brilliantly by a great supporting cast. Will Ferrell is his usual quality self as Big Earl, a homosexual gang leader who'll only give information at a price, and there is a nicely done double date with the cops, Carmen Electra and Amy Smart.  Overall, it's a funny film that is a great way to spend 90 minutes. However, I will compare it to Snoop Dogg's part in the film. There are times when it's uproariously funny, but there are a few times when you are cringing at the screen and going "Hmmm, that's not that great".   Basically, you know if this film is going to be for you or not. If you like Stiller, Wilson and Phillip's previous films, you'll like it.    3/5   "Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey..."  Bruce Almighty   Confession time. I like Jim Carrey. Not as in 'Oh, he's a very good actor in The Truman Show" - I mean "I think he's really fucking funny in Ace Ventura, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber". Yes, his films are often stupid and go for the lowest common denominator to get a cheap laugh, but often that's what you need. So, after trying to get critical acclaim as a serious actor, and not having a successful film in a couple of years, Carrey comes back to what he knows, working with the same time that gave him success with Liar, Liar.  Bruce is a local news reporter, living with his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When he finds out he is not getting a promotion live on air, Bruce goes nuts and is fired. He blames God for the injustices life has dealt him, so God (Morgan Freeman) gives him a chance to see just what Bruce can do with his powers.  Alas, instead of a true Jim Carrey comedy, what we have is a standard Hollywood "comedy with a heart", and just from reading the above paragraph, you kind of know exactly what will happen at the end (if you don't, it turns out being God is hard). That shouldn't be enough to ruin your enjoyment of the film, because with Carrey, there is a lot that can happen before he learns. Except the stuff that happens in the film aren't exactly that great. There are a few bits which are funny ("..when a monkey comes out of my ass", Grace orgasming several times by thought, a dog reading a newspaper while taking a shit) but you get the feeling that a lot is being held back so as not to offend the Christian groups.  So, unfortunately, this is just a basic comedy with a message that you should be good to people and good things will happen to you. It had potential, but  that hasn't translated well into the final film.   2/5   =  While I'm not that keen on the b3ta competition this week, I have entered  urlLink an animation  that seemed to go down well. Just don't ask what I was thinking at the time.

      Trying to sort out various bits and pieces for the wedding (lads, we need to get talking about what we're wearing and hotel rooms), we decided to sort out stuff for the ceremony. We've decided on the music TFMrs wants for entrance / exit and the hymns that we want to be sung. The only thing we're missing is the readings. There are two types of readings -    *Non - Religious One  By this, I mean like at Titch's with his sister reading a bit of Captain Correlli's Mandalin. The problem is finding such a passage. I've had no ideas, though I did look through High Fidelity by Nick Hornby, convinced there was a bit later on it where he talked about why he and his bird were staying together in that. If we can't find anything, it's fine - it's not required.   *A Bible Passage  Remember at primary school where you were given times to go read a book from a selection in the classroom. As I am a pretty quick reader, I picked up the only book I hadn't read - The Bible. So, there I sat as a 10 year old for the next few weeks reading it - which I think simultaneously impressed and scared Mrs Colley, my teacher. She came over to me once and asked what I thought about it. I came up with some guff about how it was inspiring and good to learn more about Christianity, which to be fair, it was, but in a different way to what she thought (saying that, I AM a reverend).  The Bible is a collection of writings of a bunch of dead nutters who died thousands of years ago which have been editted throughout time (wording altered, whole passages just removed) to fit their whims.  So, last night, I had a look through suggested passages and tried to find one. It proved to me what I knew anyway.  NO-ONE KNOWS WHAT THE BIBLE IS GOING ON ABOUT  You look at these passages in Corinthians and Genesis that people have suggested are romantic. What they forget to do is read AROUND the selected passages. Most of the verses about the love between man and a woman then go on and basically say "Oh, yeah, by the way girls, you're that guy's bitch now. Do that the fuck he says or God'll come around and fucking well smite you."   I've rejected passages because they come from paragraphs that, quite frankly, if someone said the same ideas in a speech in Parliment or on TV, they would be slaughtered before you could say 'Kilroy'.  So, at the moment, I have no need idea what is going to be said.  =  Other stuff in The Bible. Yes, I did look at Ezekiel 25:17, but the version my parents had isn't anyway as cool as the version Tarantino basically had.  The other point is to do with homosexuality. In the US, this is a regualr hot potato, and it became hotter recently with the gay bishop stuff.  The Christian Right usually starts quoting scripture, in particular, one verse in Leviticus (can't remember where it but the text is along the lies of "You shalt not lie with a man as if he was a woman, or you shall be put to death). The problem is, again, that they are not quoting the rest of Leviticus, which when it comes down to it, is a guide to life for a desert dwelling tribe who need to increase there numbers and reduce disease. There is stuff in there about cleanliness rituals to make sure no-one eats rotten food. I will bet you that most people who quote it do not live there life by the rest of the rules listed in there.  This point was made well, would you believe, on a wrestling website when regular columnist,  urlLink Eric S. , got pissed off with another site writer for quoting Leviticus.    If any one sin, and hear the voice of one swearing, and is a witness either because he himself hath seen, or is privy to it: if he do not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity.  Whosoever toucheth any unclean thing, either that which hath been killed by a beast, or died of itself, or any other creeping thing: and forgetteth his uncleanness, he is guilty, and hath offended.  And if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man, according to any uncleanness wherewith he is wont to be defiled: and having forgotten it, come afterwards to know it, he shall be guilty of an offence.  The person that sweareth, and uttereth with his lips, that he would do either evil or good, and bindeth the same with an oath, and his word: and having forgotten it afterwards understandeth his offence, let him do penance for his sin. - Leviticus 5:1-5   So, if you hear someone swearing, you're damned.   Whosoever shall sin, and despising the Lord, shall deny to his neighbour the thing delivered to his keeping, which was committed to his trust; or shall by force extort any thing, or commit oppression; Or shall find a thing lost, and denying it, shall also swear falsely, or shall do any other of the many things, wherein men are wont to sin:  Being convicted of the offence, he shall restore all that he would have gotten by fraud, in the principal, and the fifth part besides, to the owner, whom he wronged. - Leviticus 6:2-5   So, if you borrow something from someone and forget to pay it back, or if you find something and don't return it, you're damned.   Whatsoever hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, you shall eat.  But whatsoever cheweth indeed the cud, and hath a hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others: that you shall not eat, but shall reckon it among the unclean...The hare also: for that too cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof.  And the swine, which, though it divideth the hoof, cheweth not the cud.  The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor shall you touch their carcasses, because they are unclean to you. - Leviticus 11:3-4, 6-8   So, if you eat pork or rabbit, you're damned.   These are the things that breed in the waters, and which it is lawful to eat. All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat.  But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those things that move and live in the waters, shall be an abomination to you, and detestable. Their flesh you shall not eat: and their carcasses you shall avoid.  All that have not fins and scales, in the waters, shall be unclean. - Leviticus 11:9-12   So, if you eat lobster or shrimp, you're damned.   If a woman having received seed shall bear a man child, she shall be unclean seven days, according to the days of separation of her flowers.  And on the eighth day the infant shall be circumcised.  But she shall remain three and thirty days in the blood of her purification. She shall touch no holy thing: neither shall she enter into the sanctuary, until the days of her purification, be fulfilled. - Leviticus 12:2-4   So if your spouse gives birth to a boy and you touch her within a week after she gives birth, you're damned.  And if you don't mutilate the kid eight days after birth, he's damned and so are you.  And if she comes to church within a month after giving birth, she's damned.   But if she shall bear a maid child, she shall be unclean two weeks, according to the custom of her monthly courses. And she shall remain in the blood of her purification sixty-six days.   And it's even worse if she gives birth to a daughter.  You touch her within two weeks, and you're damned.  She goes to church within two months, and she's damned.   The man that hath an issue of seed, shall be unclean.  Issue of seed shall be unclean... These legal uncleannesses were instituted in order to give the people a horror of carnal impurities.  And then shall he be judged subject to this evil, when a filthy humour, at every moment, cleaveth to his flesh, and gathereth there.  Every bed on which he sleepeth, shall be unclean, and every place on which he sitteth.  If any man touch his bed, he shall wash his clothes and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.  If a man sit where that man hath sitten, he also shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.  He that toucheth his flesh, shall wash his clothes: and being himself washed with water shall be unclean until the evening.  If such a man cast his spittle upon him that is clean, he shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.  The saddle on which he hath sitten shall be unclean.  And whatsoever has been under him that hath the issue of seed, shall be unclean until the evening. He that carrieth any of these things, shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, he shall be unclean until the evening.  Every person whom such a one shall touch, not having washed his hands before, shall wash his clothes: and being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.  If he touch a vessel of earth, it shall be broken: but if a vessel of wood, it shall be washed with water.  If he who suffereth this disease be healed, he shall number seven days after his cleansing: and having washed his clothes, and all his body in living water, he shall be clean. - Leviticus 15:2-13   So if you should have an orgasm and your sperm doesn't end up in a vagina somewhere, you've got a helluva lot of washing to do.  And you'd better remember to do the same thing seven days later, or else you're damned.  Kinda makes jacking off a lot less fun, huh?   The man from whom the seed of copulation goeth out, shall wash all his body with water: and he shall be unclean until the evening.  The garment or skin that he weareth, he shall wash with water: and it shall be unclean until the evening.  The woman, with whom he copulateth, shall be washed with water: and shall be unclean until the evening. - Leviticus 15:16-18   And you'd better make sure that you're in deep when you orgasm, otherwise you and your partner have a lot of washing to do.   The woman, who at the return of the month, hath her issue of blood, shall be separated seven days.  Every one that toucheth her, shall be unclean until the evening.  And every thing that she sleepeth on, or that she sitteth on in the days of her separation, shall be defiled.  He that toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes: and being himself washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.  Whosoever shall touch any vessel on which she sitteth, shall wash his clothes: and himself being washed with water, shall be defiled until the evening.  If a man copulateth with her in the time of her flowers, he shall be unclean seven days: and every bed on which he shall sleep, shall be defiled.  The woman that hath still issue of blood many days out of her ordinary time, or that ceaseth not to flow after the monthly courses, as long as she is subject to this disease, shall be unclean, in the same manner as if she were in her flowers.  Every bed on which she sleepeth, and every vessel on which she sitteth, shall be defiled.  Whosoever toucheth them shall wash his clothes: and himself being washed with water, shall be unclean until the evening.  If the blood stop and cease to run, she shall count seven days of her purification. - Leviticus 15:19-28   So, if you don't lock your wife away for seven days after her period, and burn her bed afterward, and don't make sure you don't touch it or her while she's on the rag, you're damned.   Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy sister by father or by mother: whether born at home or abroad.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or thy daughter’s daughter: because it is thy own nakedness.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, whom she bore to thy father: and who is thy sister.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: because she is thy mother’s flesh.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother: neither shalt thou approach to his wife, who is joined to thee by affinity.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: because she is thy son’s wife, neither shalt thou discover her shame.  Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: because it is the nakedness of thy brother. - Leviticus 18:7-18   Better make sure that the bathroom's empty before you go in there, otherwise you might be damned.   Thou shalt not make thy cattle to gender with beasts of any other kind. Thou shalt not sow thy field with different seeds. - Leviticus 19:19   Don't follow any sane modern farming practices, or else you're damned.   Nor shall you cut your hair roundwise: nor shave your beard. - Leviticus 19:27   Shave and a haircut, you're damned.   You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh, for the dead: neither shall you make in yourselves any figures or marks. - Leviticus 19:28   That pierced ear and tattoo you have...uh, you're damned.   Go not aside after wizards: neither ask any thing of soothsayers, to be defiled by them. - Leviticus 19:31   Read a horoscope in the newspaper, you're damned.   He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die. He hath cursed his father, and mother: let his blood be upon him. - Leviticus 20:9   Hope you've never said anything bad about mumsy and dadsy.   If any man commit adultery with the wife of another, and defile his neighbour’s wife: let them be put to death, both the adulterer and the adulteress. - Leviticus 20:10   Get a little on the side, get killed.   If any man lie with a woman in her flowers, and uncover her nakedness, and she open the fountain of her blood: both shall be destroyed out of the midst of their people. - Leviticus 20:18   Have sex with a woman who's on the rag, get killed.   The man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:  And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. All the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die. - Leviticus 24:15-16   Say "goddamn", get killed.   My favourite that I found last night - deals with women who are 'issuing blood'. Once a woman has spent the week 'issuing blood' (in which time, of course, any person or object she touches becomes 'unclean'), the woman shall take two pigeons to the church, where the priest will offer one as a blood sacrifice and one as a blood sacrifice, this cleansing the woman. Next time someone starts Bible quoting, throw that one at them.

      Ho hum, not much happening in the world at the minute. Quick discussion of stuff I learnt from television last night.  -AC Milan rule, particularly the unfortunately monikered Kaka. -Pete Townshend's reputation was done no favours by the Beeb Brasseye-stylee Special last night. He had advanced warning of about a day that he was going to be arrested, which is handy if you, say, want to destroy incriminating evidence on various electronic storage media.  Now a question to be pondered by you, the reader. As I have mentioned several times on here and in various other discussions, I have an idea for a movie/ book/ comic strip etc. I'm starting to think I should write it down, because it is growing into a full formed plot (no ending as yet, just the first 2 acts). I have no aspirations to sell my idea to Hollywood and become the new Charlie Kaufman (or even sell it to Moving Pictures and become the new Richard Cuntis) but, hell, it could be a bit of a laugh. Now here's the question - what format?   A Novel  This is simultanously the easiest and hardest way to get everything down that I want in the story. It's a very descriptive method and it's easier to get character's motivations and feelings across. However, it's a lot of work to get everything to sound right, and, as you will know if you've read any book, it's very easy for it to turn to a load of shite.   A Graphic Novel  It's a good format for the story in question, I think. As I watch films and stuff, and have in various daydreams thought of  shots for the inevitable movie adaptation, I know what framing to use for various bits of the film. The problems include the fact that I'm not a great detail drawer (I can do outlines and such), which would mean it ending up looking like a movie storyboard (which isn't too bad, but misses a lot of detail). Another is that the story may get a bit 'wordy' in places, and this isn't the best format for that.   A Script/Screenplay  This is the idea I've been playing with the most. The problem is that it's actually quite hard to get in the correct frame of mind for writing and reading these damned things. It would lose some of the descriptive power that the previous formats have and is very dialogue driven. Mind you, if I get a decent script, I could always give it to some unemployed bloke who can draw a bit and kill two birds with one stone.  Any thoughts?  =  In the mean time - more shopped images!

      Welcome readers, old and new (Hello Adam Leonard)  Well, after a week where 100% of the writing staff on the blog have fallen ill, it's good to get back to a boring ol' weekend. And first of all, it's worth mentioning  I WILL HAVE A FOOTBALL CLUB TO SUPPORT NEXT YEAR.  Woohoo! Bitchin'. It's not all good news, since we still have debts to pay off, will probably sell Elland Road and Thorp Arch Training Ground, will probably get relegated (although the package is allegedly based on relegation, so if we stay up, bonus) and have to lose several players to break even (15 players on contracts worth £1M a year), but at least, in the meantime, Leeds Utd are pretty much 'safe'.  =  And just when you thought it couldn't get any better, I managed to pick up The Ring and Brasseye on DVD for less than £20! Nice. The Ring is still truely great (I will do a side by side comparison of it and the original Japanese version, Ringu, when some twat comes back off honeymoon) but watching Brasseye has just brought back so many memories. The dangers of the new drug, Cake. Tommy Vance's instruction video for new prison inmates. Suttcliffe!, the musical life story of the Yorkshire Ripper. But of course, the highlight is having the "evil, sick" ( (c) Daily Mail) 2001 Paedophile Special ("Welcome to Paedogeddon).  "Paedophiles have more genetic material in common with crabs that people like you and me. It's a scientifc fact. There is no evidence for it, but it is scientific fact." "Does your child smell funny? Strange question, but research has shown that paedophiles make your children smell like hammers" "Paedophiles control and area of the internet the size of Ireland." "'Baltimora', meaning, literally 'I'm running at them now with my trousers down'." "I'm talking Nonse-Sense"     Just great.  =  Went out on Saturday into Cleckheaton, to celebrate Pops's birthday (which was on Wednesday. Damn, I'm shit at remembering birthdays). We ended up in the shittiest 'club' ever (basically a WMC above some shops) but since drink had been had, didn't really care. Here are three interesting things i discovered Saturday night.  1) One of Charlotte's mates has been friendly with a Premiership footballer in Dubai. 2) One of my friends has had a dream about walking in on another friend and his family while they were all masturbating. 3) One of my friends got caught masturbating... in class.  =  Called around to the Wragg-Devlin place on Sunday, which was fun seeing them hungover while looking after a hyperactive baby, and got to hear three new words which Barney has mastered.  "Don't" "Why" (particularly brilliant to ask just after Daddy says "No") "Up" (my favourite. It means he wants to be lifted up and is accompanied by a little jump and the flapping of his arms)  =  TFMrs and I noted this weekend that we have still only been bought one, ONE, present from the list. Come on, I needs me kettle. People have also started sending off RSVPs, which is cool.  =  Right, better get myself geared up for 'work' i.e. thinking up what else I can stick in that picture below.

      Jesus. Sick as a dog last weekend. Went in to school on Friday, the other teachers took one look at me and told me to go back to bed. I'm thinking, come on! 3 day weekend, until I realised just how sick I was. It liyterally took me 4 hours on Saturday morning just to muster the strength to get a glass of water, which I promptly threw back up after drinking. Feelin' fine now, mind. So... didn't get much done this weekend, save a lot of movie watching. So how 'bout some film reviews?      It was a choice in the shop between this and  Once Upon A Time In Mexico , and I wish I hadn't chosen this. Not that it's a bad movie, it just isn't all that great. But as the box office will tell ya, put two of the coolest actors in Hollywood (Jackson and Farrell) together on the poster looking mean, and you've got a hit, regardless of whether it's good or not. Is it me, or has Samuel L Jackson not done a really good film since  Unbreakable ? This is also comfortably the worst film I've seen Colin Farrell in.  The problem with the movie is that it clings so tightly to Hollyowood Summer Blockbuster conventions that it just leaves you bored, your only thoughts of interest being "Hmm, I wonder which of the gang will die / turn evil next". Let's go down the checklist, shall we?    Maverick / "loose cannon" cop?  Check. Farrell & partner disobey police orders in the first scene, leaving them in the unforgiving hands of....   Arsehole "can't wait for you to fail" Chief of Police, who everyone hates?  Oooh yes. Thus we get lots of "You play by the rules, or you're off the force" style arguments. Yay!   Woman cop?  Fo' sure. Woman SWAT cop, no less (Michelle Rodriguez, aka Hollywood's top scowler). And of course, everyone is surprised everytime they meet her. Because she's a woman. Do they not go to the fucking cinema?   Eurovillain?  D'ya even have to ask? This time we get Olivier Martinez (best known for shagging Kylie), who does little else but reek of Gallic arrogance in every scene.   Ridiculously over the top end sequence?  They land a plane on a bridge. Then admit on the DVD extras that there is no fucking way that could ever happen in real life.   Big Long Punch-Up?  Yes, between Farrell and ex-partner turned French bloke's rescuer. Decent fight, not very well shot though.   Basically, the movie's star power saves it from going down the shitter. Jackson looks cool whatever he does, even in terrible 70's cop flick remakes, and Farrell is one of only three actors today that I'd pay to watch, whatever he did (Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott being the other two*). The action sequences are generally well done, though nothing out of the ordinary (and certainly nothing that warrants the $100m budget the movie had -  Three Kings  had better action sequences for less than half that amount). It's just a dumb, fun action movie. Better than  Revolutions , but then what isn't?  *just kidding. I meant Brendan Fraser and Ben Affleck.

      You know when you watch a series on TV that you really liked but then,after a while, you just stop caring? It gets to the point that while it is on, you check your bank accounts or just twat about on the internet and don't pay any real attention until it gets to the point that you just don't watch. Well, last night, I made a concious decision - I WILL NEVER WATCH E.R. AGAIN.  E.R. has basically had problems in that it's original major stars, George Clooney and Goose from Top Gun, left and they've had to bring in new cast members who just don't interest in the same way. This year, they have already got rid of the most interesting character in a helicopter crash and had 2 episodes concentrating on two characters trips to Africa to helpfully inform us "Africa is poor". So, last night, I sit down to watch and we get another "Africa is poor" episode combined with the introduction of a new character played by Thandie "Blandly Bland's Bland" Newton. I watched the first ten minutes and turned off.  There is a real problem for me at the minute. The US could consistently produce hour long drama series that were clever, funny and interesting. It made UK drama look cheap and badly acted. But look at the past few years.   Buffy The Vampire Slayer  A brilliant, funny series which managed to take the one-note idea of the film (Blonde girl is the hero instead of screaming and running away) and turned in six quality series. Unfortunately, it's now gone and it's last series blew chunks.   Angel  A spin-off of the above, which I did not get into until TFMrs bought the DVDs. And just as it hits it's stride and produces a series better than any it's parent show did, it gets cancelled.   The X-Files  The X-Files used to be awesome. It was creepy, intelligent and well written. Then it started to suck, they brought in the T-1000 when Duchovny left to become a film star. It stuck around for about 3 too many series before it was finally mercy killed. (My theory on the X-Files - in the first 3 series, they limited 'funny' episodes, like the man who could predict people's deaths, to one per series. Because they got a good response, the final few series became funny episodes with conspiracy episodes that made no sense to continuity, forgetting that people liked the episodes with creepy mutants and psychic serial killers.)   Star Trek  After the greatness of TNG and DS9, Voyager was a real drop in quality, only peaking, appropriately, when Jerry Ryan's breasts became involved. After they destroyed the scariest the bad guy in the series week after week, people stopped caring. Now we have Quantum Trek, which isn't all that great.  That's five series that I constantly used to watch that are now gone or I just won't watch. That doesn't include various cop shows and the like that I also occasionally watched. The scary thing - nothing is replacing them! There are two US drama series that I will still religiously watch -  The Shield  (corrupt cops in the rough area of LA) and Alias (Spy girl stuff - which may get stupid with the end of Series 2 'twist'). There is nothing coming along to replace the old stuff. What have we been offered? Without A Trace, a series about missing people, and  The OC , Dawsons Creek with 'tude. Shite.  But then, there is another problem - US comedy series are dying too!   Friends  Ended in the US, soon to be done here too. I guess endless T4 repeats will have to suffice.*   The Simpsons  Face it, it's dead. The new ones aren't putting in 'joke' jokes - they're just putting in ridiculously signposted puns and slapstick. A mercy killing would probably have been in order   Frasier  Also in it's final series. Yes, there may have been a drop in quality, but any show which can get laughs out of Patrick Stewart believing Frasier is his new boyfriend is still top draw.   Sex And The City  HA! Fuck off, I'm glad this fucking overrated bilge will be off our screens in 2 days. When your cast start looking like emaciated mummies, it's probably time to give up.  This, to me, is a serious problem. The US forced the UK to come out with comedies and dramas that could compete with the quality they produced, and now there isn't anything else coming. I also like long series - UK shows tend to be bought in blocks of six, while the US produce 24 episode series, which allow more character exploration.   So, if anyone can recommend a new series to me, please do. It's that or get a hobby.  *shudder*  *Dan, two Friends points.  1. Did you realise how much Series 1 blew? Watching a block of repeats, it became really obvious. There is a heavy reliance of unfunny monologues, such as Monica's underage boyfriends really terrible speech about "Gunpoint". It got much better towards the end, but you can tell in the final episode and the first of Series 2, there has been an active push to turn the characters to pretty much what we know today (well, except Ross).  2. Do you remember Danny - got fogged because he looked like a yeti, pissed of Rachel, fucked his sister? Did you know that he was introduced to replace Ross, due to Schwimmer stalling on his contract as he wanted to go direct proper stuff, who was wondering whether to go off with Emily or not? Fortunately, Schwimmer resigned, so Danny was sent off to commit incest.

      With crazy scenes like this in the Korean houses of parliament following the impeachment of President Roh Moo-Hyun, I think I can rest easy knowing that I shouldn't expect an Al-Qaeda-inspired political coup happening here anytime soon.        *I know, it's not a chair.

      In Korea and Japan they love theme days that make you spend money on gifts for other people to show how much you like them. I told you about Pepero Day back in the wintry days of November, remember? No? You ignorant sods.     Well, last Sunday was White Day. Let me explain. On Valentine's Day here, birds buy blokes chocolate. No need for the bloke to get his wallet out, which rocks. But, a month later comes White Day, where the bloke buys sweets for his bird. Shitehawks, as Inno might have once said. I know what you're thinking, no bird for Dan, ergo no obligation to buy sugary treats, right? (you could get about 10 Googlewhacks out of this entry alone, I'll wager). Well, it's complicated. Oh, she's still getting married in 4 weeks time, but she was mightily pissed off when Sunday came and went and she hadn't so much as a penny chew to her name. Needless to say a text-message guilt trip extravaganza ensued, meaning that I had to make a swift trip to the sweet shop after school yesterday where my time constraints and lack of Korean bartering skills meant I picked up the first thing I saw, which happened to be a 25.000 won heart-shaped box of Chupa Chup lollipops. It did the trick, but I'm getting pissed off at these stupid days where people fly off the handle if you don't buy them stuff to prove your love. Especially the ones where I don't get shit bought for me.  Incidentally, April 14th is 'Black Day', where it's the single peoples' turn to buy stuff. They get together and eat noodles. Fucking nuts, this place is.    New coolest thing to get off the Internet : A Game Boy Advance emulator. Do a search on Kazaa -  they're about 300k in size, so no bitching from Mr Haigh. There are shit loads of ROMS on Kazaa as well (though you should have the original game if you're going to use these, kids), size is between 1 meg (Tetris) and 16 megs (huge RPGs like Golden Sun). The games are  urlLink wicked awesome , especially Pokemon Ruby / Sapphire, the aforementioned Golden Sun (and sequel), and Advance Wars 2, which is like a cross between Risk and Command and Conquer, only way, way better. Be like me, and waste countless hours staring at a small corner of your PC screen!     Dogma  was on TV last night . God, I hate Kevin Smith movies. At first I just hated  Mallrats , but now I hate 'em all (except  Clerks , which rules, and  Chasing Amy , which I only mildly dislike). From the cheap special effects, 4th grade toilet humor (note to Smith: when you're trying to create a biting, yet funny satire of organised religion, best not to include a scene right in the middle which makes  Freddy Got Fingered  look like high-brow entertainment) to the just plain awful acting (Fiorentino couldn't get more monotonous if she substituted her voice box for a fucking Speak N' Spell; and thank God Salma Hayek has a nice arse), it's just a bad, bad movie.    Quiz time  (or, Dan can't be arsed to look on imdb time): You know the new Star Trek with Quantum Leap guy (they just started showing it in Korea so it's still new for me) - what else has that English engineer bloke been in? Or am I just getting a bit confused because he looks a bit like David Duchovny?  UPDATE (I couldn't bear the tension): Desmond's!!!!! That's where I remember him from.     From a Peckham barber shop to the Starship Enterprise. The boy done good. He's picked up one of those "I'm an Englishman on American TV, so I must talk in this annoying accent" voices though.

      Another weekend, another wasted couple of days. It hardly feels like I get anything done at all at the moment, at work or at home. Anyway, wedding wise, we have:  - My shoes - Centrepiece stuff.  Get in. I need to organise soon a trip to Suits You for the ushers when Titch returns. I also need the measurements of a certain usher who is in Korea (you put them on one of the original comments boards, but that was shit and went down constantly).  Checking the gift list this weekend, we found that we have had our first wedding present bought! Huzzah! So, thanks to my Godfather, Mick, TFMrs and I will have some kitchen utensils to help us enjoy married life. Come on, you slackers, buy me stuff!  TFMrs completed the PS2 game she bought 4 weeks ago. Bloody addict. I, myself, am close to completing Jak II, which is about 1000x times harder, so there.  More family bitching about the wedding from, would you believe, Barbara! She's got in touch with my mother to say that she's upset because I've only invited her (not + Guest) despite having had a long term relationship for so many years (maybe she might get an idea when she realises I didn't know because I haven't talked to her in years). My mother has caved so she can bring her bloke (Ian?), whereas I am still volunteering to take all the blame from my mother. Blah. Families.  Speaking of families, Jo's had her scan, and since certain parts didn't seem to be visible, it looks like I will have a niece.  == What a weekend of sport, eh? Leeds are fucked despite the previous 2 matches being pretty good results, The Arse are great even when not playing well, Kewell is still a diving piece of shit, but thankfully Owen is doing his best Emile Heskey impression, and of course...     MAN UTD ARE SHITE! NO, REALLY SHITE!  Jesus, what an awful result for them. Shaun Wright-Phillip's goal was great, but the rest should have been easily cleared. Nice to see what happens to a team when your overpriced defender forgets to take a piss. Speaking of which, his appeal claim of "Look! My hair proves I didn't take drugs!" is going to fail, mainly because THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS PUNISHED FOR.  Watched a bit of Test Match Cricket yesterday as well. Just how I liked it - over in two hours and England winning.  == I need to get Sky and Broadband, if not only so I can watch football and recieve stupidly sized pictures from Jarratt in less than an hour. TFMrs. spent about 2 hours yesterday online trying to sort out banking issues. I would have thrown the laptop across the room before then because it is so... slow... Generally, when on a banking website, what are you looking for?  1) A quick, easy system to navigate. 2) 150k worth of graphics to load with every page to make it look pretty.  On a more sad note, I sent a tape to the parents to tape Wrestlemania XX. Yes, I know you think I'm a sad twat for this, but it is the equivalent of the FA Cup Final or Superbowl for wrestling. The show had Benoit beating HHH and Shawn Michaels to become World Champion, Eddie Guerrero v Kurt Angle for the WWE Title and My Love, as well as the whole of Madison Square Gardens boing the biggest match of the night out of the building. Goldberg v Brock Lesnar was built up for about a year, but two problems occurred. Goldberg was generally getting booed for being a former WCW man, and it was generally well known that he was leaving after WM. More shockingly, Lesnar, who in 2 years had been pushed to the main events and had half of the promotion built around him, tired of the work schedule and has quit to try out for the NFL. The fans, instead of cheering two behemoths on as they ripped each other apart, practically rioted because they knew the two were grabbing the money and leaving. All in all, it sounded one of the most eventful shows in years. So naturally...  THEY FORGOT TO TAPE IT.  Jesus.   ==  How about a liddle bit o' politics folks.  Basically, I'm very worried about next year after the events in Spain last week. The theory goes that the bombs were Al Qaeda, attacking Spain for there participation in the Iraq invasion / "War on Islam". Three days later, the polls for the general election open and Prime Minister Aznar is kicked out. This isn't entirely unexpected as his decision to go to war wasn't backed by Spaniards (5% in a poll last year agreed with the military action) and his insistence that ETA was behind the bombs despite the evidence of Al Qaeda involvment ("Koran found in nearby van? ETA haven't managed to kill 20 people in total since 2000? NO, IT WAS ETA! ETA! BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, I CAN'T HEAR YOU") was pissing off people because it looked like Aznar was trying to deflect criticism of himself.  Now it looks like Al Qaeda have influenced the outcome of an election against one of the main backers of the Iraq invasion. This does not bode well for Bush, Blair and Austrialia's John Howard, or the people in major cities within these countires, because they all face elections within the next 12 months or so. If Al Qaeda have managed to bring down a government using a handful of bombs on trains, imagine what they could do if they want to get rid of Blair or Bush.  == Right, I promise, a film review is coming. And, hopefully, I will get to see Starsky and Hutch next week, so you'll probably get one of that too.  ==  Quick extra bit - you know those times when someone is taking a photo and you could really do without looking dodgy...

      So they're showing series 10 of Friends here in Korea, 3 times a week. As I said before, the first episode was shite (although I failed to mention Chandler's reference to Buckwheat (AKA Mike Shitter, which slightly redeemed it). The second episode ruled though, with Chandler and Monica visiting Phoebe's friends who had adopted, and Chandler inadvertently spilling the beans. Emma's birthday episode kicked arse too, but was followed by the wankest episode ever (even worse than those 'random clip' ones they like to throw together, the cheap bastards). Reasons for this:    Christina Applegate is shit. I hate her. You should too. And don't start the "But Dan, she's foxy" argument with me either. So is practically every other bird who goes on the show, and they manage to be funny.  Worst character ever. Worst writing ever. She was on the show before and was nothing special, but here they crank her bitchiness and irresponsibility up to 11 to give us the illusion we're watching something new and funny. Fact: the writers think you're stupid.  She really wouldn't be so bad if we hadn't seen her character acted and written much better before. Reese Witherspoon - better looking and funnier.  Are we really expected to believe she thought Ross was a falafel seller?  This dumbass story takes up about 2/3 of the episode. Mike proposing to Phoebe (actually pretty funny) was treated like an afterthought. Joey, Monica and Chandler might as well not have been in it, save the funniest moment of the episode, when they're talking about Joey's reference letter for the adoption agency:   Monica:   It doesn't make any sense.   Joey:   Of course it does.  It's smart!  I used a thesaurus!   Chandler:   On every word?   Joey:   Yep.   Monica:   All right, what was this sentance, originally?   Joey:   Oh.  "They're warm, nice people with big hearts."   Chandler:   And that became, "They're humid, pre-possessing homosapiens with full-sized aortic pumps?"    Fortunately, the best moment in Friends, maybe ever, came in the next episode. Can't remember for the life in me what the episode was about (I think Greg Kinnear was in it), but ladies and gentlemen, I give you.... Ichiban: Lipstick for men!!!

      Japanese computer game creators sometimes throw up the strangest stuff. One of the best sellers in recent years was a train simulator - you literally drove a train on a rail. For the full journey. Making sure you stopped at the correct point at the station. They also have a range of games with dubious sexual content, as can be seen by the  urlLink reviews at Something Awful .  Sometimes, Japanese stuff crosses over well. Odd sounding games turn out to be fanatastic, like the Eye Toy or Dance Dance Revolution. However, I guess this may not be turning up in the arcades of Scarborough and Blackpool.   Boong-ga Boong-ga      Why, yes, that is a arcade game with a plastic finger and the lower half of a person bent over. You may think that was is the kind of sexually deviancy expected of a nation who sell knickers in vending machines and have a word that describes "many men ejaculating onto a woman's face", but apparently not so. Here's what the makers have to say.   This is a fun game of spanking the people that make your life miserable. When you spank the character that you choose to punish, the face expression of the character will change as they scream and twitch in pain. The funny face expressions will make people laugh and relieve stress.   Okay. Here's a point. Why does a 'spanking' simulator have a controller that is  inserted  into the arse of the character?    Characters include: Ex Girlfriend, Ex Boyfriend, Gangster, Mother-In-Law, Gold Digger, Prostitute, Child Molester, Con Artist."   MOTHER - IN - LAW?!  Japanese people relieve stress by sticking their finger up the simulated arse of their mother-in-law? Sick, sick, sick puppies.   urlLink Click here  for the brochure.

      Not many e-mails you get in a day referring to you as a Reverend.    Your request for ordination has been processed, and you are now an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in Modesto, California!   Please record the above date of ordination for your records, as you may need this information in the future to fill out the various forms of the clergy.    If you were ordained previously, the above date will constitute a valid date upon which you were RE-ordained.   Ordination is for life, without price, and without question of your specific beliefs.    You do NOT need to pay any tithe, donation, or offering of any kind, now or in the future.  As a minister, you are authorized by the church to perform the rites and ceremonies of the church (except circumcision), including weddings, funerals, baptisms and blessings, subject to the laws of your country, state, or locality.  Prior to conducting any civil ceremony (such as marriages), you should know and comply with the laws pertaining to your area of jurisdiction.      That's me all holy, then. So, if you need any ceremonies that don't involve genital mutilation, give us a shout!

      Considering the accusations made against  crap Canadian  heroic Brit Greg Rusedski and the Hutton Report, you'd think the BBC would be careful in the current climate about potentially embarrasing mistakes, wouldn't you.  From today's BBC Sport frontpage:     Oops.  EDIT: From Mediawatch of F365. I didn't send this in, so are there more A-MOL readers than I thought? If so, I want credit, dammit.    Juxtaposition Of The Day  On the BBC Academy section of their website...  'What makes Thierry Henry such a great striker?'  Immediately followed by...  'The Facts About Nandrolone'.  Have they learnt nothing from the Hutton report?

      While waiting for my calling to be confirmed by e-mail, I've decided to mess about with pictures again. The first on I put on b3ta. It was quick and nasty but worked quite well.     The second is an attempt to create a Julian Opie (think cover of Blur's Greatest Hits album) style picture. This is my first real attempt. I'm going to try it for other people, but it is quite hard to make the pictures to differ from each other (so, say, Titch doesn't look like me without glasses and Inno doesn't look like me with different hair).

      "Thanks to your wedding invite, I am going to go on the internet and change my name tomorrow"  This is the text message I got from Popsy today, because I used the Forbidden Name (H*l*n) for the invite. Since I can't do any work today (Go, go, crappy file server!), I decided to investigate how easy that was. Low and behold, Google takes me direct to a site that allows you to change your name online, in no time at all.  How stupid is that?  Think about it. I have nothing to do today, so, in a fit of whimsy, I could technically change my name legally today. Say I get home tonight, have a couple of bottles of wine and decide, while reading the bottle label, that I will from now one be known as Frascati Superiore, I could do it.  I've decided to investigate just how easy it is to do stuff like this on the internet, so first up, a  Friends  inspired investigation:   Can I become an ordained minister online?   Guess what. It's a piece of piss. I found a relevant website, the Universal Life Church of California, filled in the form, and I am waiting for my application to be processed by a minister, based on my form. So, what will this minister review before he decides I can look after the spiritual needs of people and officiate over weddings, funerals and baptisms?  *My name *My address *My e-mail *Er... that's it  So, now, I sit and wait until the US comes online (at time of posting, it's about 2.15am in California), I guess, and pray that the minister decides my e-mail is worthy enough.  In the mean time, I will try and clean up my language, because  urlLink Pornalizing the site  doesn't really make the site filthier, it just makes me sound a bit more pissed off. Not good if I want to spread The Word.  TO BE CONTINUED....

      Just wanted to get some more interesting adverts at the top. It's all wedding crap these days. Weddings are pissing me off recently, for 2 reasons:  1) if you don't know the first one, you've been living under a rock, or you're just visiting this site for sex whores  2) The Haigh / Smith wedding comes right in the middle o' term time, and since us teachers get 6 weeks a piece in the summer and winter breaks, we ain't getting any more time off that easily. My current plan of action - sick days (this involves only being in England for 4 days (Thurs/Fri/Sat/Sun) and making plenty of international phone calls at ridiculous times of day. Either way, it's going to leave me tired, and at least 500 pounds out of pocket. Someone better be buying me drinks that day.

        More of Olwen and Titch. BOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNG!     The jazzband, better lit and such so that you can marvel at the majesty of those waistcoats.    You know, drunken logic sometimes works - "Tie on head will help me remove block". And people may mock, BUT IT WORKED!    This is the moment that the Jenga tower fell. After getting up to 32 levels of bricks, Pops finally brought the tower down. The most amusing part of this picture - the joy of TFMrs, not seen since she last saw me without pants, and the fear of Vicki, not seen since the last time she saw me without pants.

      One down, two to go. With Titch's wedding done and dusted, the spotlight turns to me and TFMrs. This weekend was a very 'wedding-stuff' heavy one, but generally quite succesful. The invites are out and should be arriving at people's doors tomorrow or the next day. We have also ordered our wedding rings.  The invites were actually a lot more stressful than I thought, mainly due to various family squabbles from the minor to the major. My mine one came down to my auntie, Barbara, who I wasn't even going to invite until my mother asked nicely. You see, despite my Grandma and Barbara not speaking for 5 years or so, there is always the chance they will become best mates in the future and my mother will be seen as being in the wrong for not inviting her (My answer to this - "Blame me! Tell them I fucking hate her and it was my decision."). There is the chance I have still insulted her - I'm not sure which surname she's using at the minute (2 failed marriages) so I called her by her maiden name, which may piss her off. I've also invited only one of her five children, mainly the one who's bothered to keep in touch (not the one who had the baby and stayed with my parents, mind. My parents haven't heard from her in 2-3 years. Gratitude, eh?). So, hopefully, she'll be either pissed off at me and won't come, or the bank will extend her overdraft and she'll decide to go on the piss in Huddersfield instead that weekend.   Can't wait for the seating plans.  I went for a different ring to the one I was going to get. Instead of a plain white gold band (in the style of a bit of piping cut off to fit), I've gone for a more traditional shaped brushed white gold band, with a seam of polished gold around it. It looks pretty smart.  So, the most important things left are the suits for the groom's party, which will have to be delayed while Titch is sunning himself in the Southern Hemisphere. Apart from that, touch wood, everything seems fine.  I haven't been seeing much television or new films because we bought Angel Series 4 on DVD, and it's turned out to be one of the greatest series of television in years. Every episode ends on either a great cliffhanger or a revelation that you just have to keep watching. However, I did see Rules Of Attraction this weekend, which I may review if I'm not busy later.  Another interesting point, Google can search this page! I was convinced it couldn't, but there you go. Try a search for "Titch" and "wedding". First person to find a googlewhack gets a piece of discarded engineering. I have aluminium, steel AND PVC bits of crap floating about at the moment.   More pictures from the wedding will be up later, thanks to Andy J, who sent me a 500Kb message to be picked up off a 56k modem. Jesus, that took a while.   Just to prove how sad and geeky I am, I have a b3ta t-shirt! It looks pretty cool, with a nice pixellated bear head on the front (similar tot the icons many users have on the board).

      On a Korean TV channel they're kind enough to show Sky News on a morning, so I get all the news from back home before I go to work, which rules, if only for this morning's story about nine Leicester players being arrested in La Manga for allegedly sexually assaulting three African girls. One was released on bail having only being charged with 'failing to intervene' (presumably he was in the corner having a Peter O'Neil, or calling Mark Bosnich / Kieron Dyer / Rio Ferdinand for advice), the rest , as yet unnamed, having been remanded in custody. It's a dodgy story, however; the main reason for this being the girls didn't report that they'd been attacked until they arrived at the airport to go back to Germany. Hmm.  This of course is the second time Leicester have been in trouble in La Manga - the first time being when Stan Collymore ( who no doubt would have killed to get in on the action this time around) set off a fire extinguisher in a hotel and the entire team was asked to leave.  I just thought it was a very weird coincidence that this happened at almost the same time as Collymore admitted to the bizarre pursuit of 'dogging' - as I understand, this entails hanging round car parks propositioning strangers for casual sex. This is the same guy who:   was once one of English football's brightest talents (Man of the match in the Premiership's greatest game ever), but managed to go from playing for Liverpool to bit part roles at Bradford and Oveido in just a couple of seasons  Smacked Ulrika up in Paris (reason: "I was confused and jealous")  fancied himself as the next James Bond  is now a TV pundit (FOR WHO?? Sky? someone tell me)   I like this quote from  urlLink F365 's Mediawatch today.  Writes F365 reader Matt Martin:  'Watching Sky One's typically woeful "Premiership's Greatest" last night, I was intrigued by this quote from the one and only Stanley Victor Collymore, who they'd drafted in as one of their "talking heads":  "It's like having sex with 40,000 people at once!"'  Sweet lord, there must be more to this dogging than meets the eye. Must have been one helluva a car park...   And now, because I love you, I bring you the gift of  urlLink wasting time .

      It's funny how probably the happiest day of Titchie's life turned out to be one of the worst days in ages for me. For 5 reasons! Want to know them? I'm telling you anyway! (in order of how pissed off about it I am)   My Mum & Dad finally made the decision to have my dog Sally put down. Here's some of what she wrote to me:   Had to carry her back from the field each time, when we got there, she just kept falling over.  She wasn't suffering but her legs, especially the one she broke, had almost gone.  On Sunday, she laid there with me all day, just sleeping then almost agitated as though she didn't know what she wanted.  Kept struggling to get up, so I'd lift her back legs and then she would pace round before settling down again.  I really think she had had enough.  Dad and I took her on Sunday night, and Dad stayed with her. I couldn't.     There's a big void now as you walk round the house and she's not there.  We have had her all the time we have been up here and the kitchen's not the same without her.   She was 16 years old, and she had suffered 2 strokes in the last 3 years, but still.   Missing Titchie's wedding. And that dog who could open the crisp packet. And being included in the Worst Photo Ever.  Had the heating on full whack in my place on Sunday night (still snowing here), was just about to make dinner, so I got up, walked to the kitchen when I got the mother of all head rushes and passed out for a good 10 seconds, cutting my hand to shit on the way down somehow.   They started showing Season 10 of Friends here. A good thing you might say, but the first episode was about as funny as a James Breeze cameo in 2 Pints of Lager would be. And there was sod all cliffhanger from the previous season, which made for one of the worst episodes ever. Fortunately, the next two were quality, and I'm becoming more convinced by the day that David Schwimmer is one of the funniest comic actors around.  Finally, finally, FINALLY! Broke up with my girlfriend. For good. As she's getting married next month. To that guy. Can't really be pissed off about this, as it's been on the cards since before Christmas. I'm including it though because of the negative repercussions associated with reason (3).   Now, more recommended listening.     The Shins  -  Chutes Too Narrow  How we Brits can be proud of our indie scene is beyond me, with crap like the Coral and Muse. This is just great, great acoustic-y indie rock from the USA, from the same label that brought you Nirvana's  Bleach .      Horrorpops  -  Hell Yeah!  The name may sound like a Halloween treat, but the band sounds like a cross between No Doubt (when they rocked) and The Living End. Which is a good thing. And they're from Denmark, partially redeeming the country which brought us Aqua and Cartoons (remember them?)

      This is why I went blog. Well, not EXACTLY why.  Some guy registered a website earlier this year for his chav car stuff. It's  urlLink kroozmidz.co.uk .   Unfortunately, the young fella forgot to put an index.htm page. This means, that you can look through all his files on the site, including, in photoalbums, NAKED PICTURES OF HIS GIRLFRIEND!!     Bet she's going to be happy.  EDIT: It get's better! Using a WHOIS search, people have found out the name of the guy - Andrew Hipwood. His girlfriend is Niomi. Even better, a  urlLink simple websearch  will find his address and that he got done for driving without insurance.  The internet fucking rules.  EDIT 2: And I've found his home phone number!

      For a while, I have been raving about Garth Merenghi's Darkplace, a spoof horror show written by a washed-up horror writer set in a hospital where supernatural events unfold. Surely such a crappy program like Darkplace would never really be made?  Well, here is, er,  urlLink Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital , a horror set in a, er, hospital where supernatural events unfold.  Oh dear.   EDIT: It get's worse for King. As pointed out by "baby wet ones" on b3ta, Lars Von Trier did a horror show about a hospital where supernatural events unfold called "The Kingdom". I think getting hit by that van did more damage than first thought.

      It's early on Tuesday morning. So far today:  1) After what TFMrs and I thought was a possible cock-up, M&S have our gift list up! This is good, because we thought we'd lost it and I didn't want to spend another three hours wandering around the new Gateshead M&S Lifestyle store (think Habitat with a staff discount). If you are interested, go to MarksandSpencer.com, click Gift Registry and search for our names.     2)  Finding Nemo  and  Angel Series 4  are waiting for me at home.  3) I GOT MY GTTR POSTCARD BACK! That's means it's in and will now be processed and sent of to the relevant universities.   Nice. Details of the gift list will also be out with the invites, provisionally at the end of the week.  And how did I do:   Film  Mine: LOTR Actual: LOTR   Director  Mine: Jackson Actual: Jackson   Actor  Mine: Murray Actual: Penn   Actress  Mine: Keaton Actual: Theron   Sup. Actor  Mine: Watanabe Actual: Robbins   Sup. Actress  Mine: Zellweger Actual: Zellweger  50%. Shite.  Mystic River  screwed me. Bastards.

         Well, since getting the digital camera, I have been waiting for an oppurtunity to use it and get loads of photos. Well, like buses, this weekend had two reasons - Dad's 50th birthday bash and Titch's wedding.  I do have loads of pictures from my Dad's do, but it's really a bunch of his mates and my relations, which is a bit dull for most, really. Two pictures for your perusal, however.  The most evil picture of Cassidy ever.      Here's my sister, Jo. Considering how thin she usually is... LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THAT BUMP! Seriously, she was flat as a pancake in the belly 2 weeks ago and now look at her.     And now - the story of Sunday.  Dan, Pops, Inno, TFMrs and I set off in a taxi, after a bottle of champagne, and arrived at the church at 1pm. Since we had an hour and Leeds v Liverpool was on Premiership Plus, we went up to the pub. However, the pub was too piss poor to pay for the match, so we just had to watch build up for the Carling Cup Final and a dog who could open a packet of crisps. We had a pizza, and then went down to the church.     The service was cool - not too formal, except for the vicar going on for ages, and repeating word for word the reading that Vicki had done. Still, much amusement came from the Vicar's understanding of Titch's life ("...his best man, Andrew, who I believe he met at university, possibly as part of the skydiving club...").  And then, outside for pictures!           On to the reception in a minibus, and up to a NICE hotel. It was on the side of a hill, with a long winding road up to the carpark, which had me thinking of The Shining. As we entered, we were greeted by champagne and the most enthusiastic jazz band ever (more on which later).     After various mingling and Danny cracking a highly inappropriate joke about Olwen and Titch in front of her father, we went through for the meal - a buffet. It was a nice meal, but unfortunately, there was some kind of cock-up and our table ended up waiting for ages for our fodder. Here's a pic of Pops slipping into a coma, waiting for the potatoes.     We were entertained throughout the meal by the jazz band, who were pretty damned good. They had a camp, fat singer with odd facial hair, but towards the end, he hung on to a high note for nearly a minute, and then continuing straight into the rest of the song, which was awesome.     One point about the band - they had the coolest bass guitar I've ever seen.     And onto the speeches. Olwen's dad came out with a typical dad speech, including stuff about the road signs of Switzerland (it made sense, but still sounds, appropriately, odd). Titch then did an absolutely awesome speech - he basically managed to come across as a guy who didn't know what to say, but then came out with the right stuff. The best bit of this being when, reading off his list of stuff to do in the speech, he goes "Er, I have to say how good my wife looks", which everyone laughs at, and then turns to Olwen, looked in her eyes and told her she was beautiful. Jesus, he couldn't have planned that better - it nearly had INNO in tears! Jarratt then managed to get a pretty good speech out, based around the fact he had been BANNED from mentioning several stories (hopefully, Jarratt will send me Olwen's e-mail to him...), and brilliantly called Titch "Titch" several times throughout.     So, after the meal and a few more drinks, came JENGA!!!!     (Hmmm, that pose could be fun with Photoshop...) A load of games were set up (Twister, Scaletrix and such) but after scaring Titch's cousin off, we had a team game of Jenga. Unbelievably, it went on for ages, until one of Inno's goes. Inno spent about 5 minutes trying to get a block out, and a crowd of all the guests gathered, watching intently. He did it, and we had a couple more rounds with the entire room on tenterhooks! There are two pictures from the wedding that I want - me in Jenga Rambo mode and the moment the tower fell, went shows the despair and joy as the game ended. It was like a cup final.     It was a great day, with the bonus that I'm not too bad this morning! Back of the net. As I said last night, I happily accept having a friend who is the father of a 18 month old child, but having a married friend is extremely bizarre.   I have a question to ask before I finish:     Is this the Worst. Picture. Ever. Taken?  (Oi! Lloyd, you shit. I think if you go through i-do-i-do-i-do.co.uk, it will take you to the Debenham's site. And it might be closed. And Titch may not read this for a while as he is of to Fiji and NZ for a month)

      From today's Guardian, because it made me laugh:  With so many of Richard Clarke's criticisms of the Bush administration hitting home, it would be a shame to overlook an earlier darkly comic episode from the former counter-terrorism tsar's memoir, Against All Enemies. We join Richard shortly after the 1990 Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack on the Tokyo subway, at a meeting with the FBI and the CIA to discuss whether the Aum were operative in the States. "By now," he writes, "I had enough experience with CIA and FBI to doubt that they would ever have heard of the Aum. I was not disappointed. Except for press reports from the previous 12 hours, they had nothing in their files on the Aum."  Richard asks John O'Neill, representative to the Counter terrorism Security Group, how he can be so sure the Aum are not in the US. "'Did you look them up in the Manhattan phone book to see if they're there?' 'You serious?' O'Neill asked, not sure whether I was being funny. When I assured him I meant it, he directed his deputy to leave the conference room and call FBI New York. A while later the FBI agent returned to the room and handed O'Neill a note. O'Neill glanced at it and said, 'Fuck. They're in the phone book, on East 48th Street at Fifth.'" Most cheering.   =  As a little extra, may I just say  urlLink "Fuck off, 'Gareth'".   Oh, shit! They've used The Forbidden Name!

      Well, after trying to find a date suitable for my stag-do (currently 29th May. If you have any issues, comment board or text) and explaining the principles of Photoluminescence Spectroscopy to a bunch of bored engineers yesterday, it's nice to start today with some good news.  I'm officially on the PGCE course! WOO YAY!  I start on the 15th Sept. Since that's a Friday, I'm guessing induction or something and finding out which Primary school I have to go to the following week (2 weeks in Primary to help us understand the level of knowledge when kids enter Secondary School).  So, at last, it's good to have it confirmed - in a few weeks, I get to tell my current employers to go fuck themselves!  =  Well, it's probably going to be depressing for me, but the summer transfer market is starting to look good already. Here's my favourite rumours at the moment:  Rivaldo to Bolton Ruud Van Nistelrooy to Barcelona or Real Madrid Alan Smith to Valencia, Bayern Munich or, erm, Birmingham City Steven Gerrard to Manchester United Jonathan Woodgate to Arsenal (£15M apparently. Come on, sell-on fee!) David Beckham to Chelsea Ronaldo to Chelsea  =  Want to see what Friends producers talk about?  urlLink Courtesy of The Smoking Gun.   I personally think "The One With The Serial Rapist" would have been a hoot.  Here's a problem for the case though:  'I have never been aware of the Friends episodes I've worked on involving  urlLink pornography ,  urlLink people having sex on the show  or  urlLink nudity '  Is this a completely different 'Friends' sitcom?  =  Contrast and compare: The new Iraq flag, which must have taken someone all of 2 minutes:     Leeds United Home Kit, 1994     And, I'm not one to question the USA's tactics in Iraq, but can anyone see a problem with  urlLink this?    US forces today announced an end to their siege of Falluja, saying they will pull out immediately to allow a newly-created, Iraqi security force to secure the city.  The new force, known as the Falluja Protective Army, will consist of up to 1,100 Iraqi soldiers led by a former general from the military of Saddam Hussein and will begin moving into the city tomorrow.   =  Just to finish a link-tastic post, have some  urlLink Eastender lookalikes!

      I just figured out that in the next 7 weeks, I'll be seeing my Wednesday classes precisely one time. Reasons for this:    May 5: Children's Day. Imagine if every kid in the country has a birthday on the same day. That's what Children's Day is, apparently. Parents buy kids stuff, and take them downtown / to the cinema / amusement park, meaning National Holiday for everyone. Note to self: stay inside that day.  May 12: I'm working at English camp. Good laugh, and they pay you extra for it. Bonus.  May 19: School trip to one of the 16,000,000 mountains in Korea. I bet the place will still be packed with eager Korean hikers though.  May 26: Buddha's birthday (national holiday). Happy birthday, you old bastard.  June 2: Class.  June 9: I'll be flying somewhere over Russia (booking the tickets this weekend)  June 16: Another English camp.   Crazy. Bit of a boring post, this, but I'm bored (I told my students this afternoon that they could skip class to practice for next weeks sports day*). Here's something to liven it up though:     Proof that the King of Queens is utter bullshit. Only in a post-apocalyptic world where 90% of the male population have been wiped out would a woman like that be married to a fat postman.   *sports day in Korea: 2 days of dodgeball and tug of war. Seriously.

      As Dan mentioned on an earlier comments board (which people are allowed to place comments in, even if it’s just any old shite. You know who you are, lurkers), the WWE has introduced a new character – Eugene Dinsmore, retard.     Now, let’s face it, the WWE is not the haven of the politically correct. We have had Kamala The Ugandan Giant – a cannibal who was too stupid to pin opponents the right way round. In the first Gulf War, Vince decided the best way to cash in was to have Sgt Slaughter change sides and support the Iraqi army. The year before last, there was the homosexual tag-team, Billy and Chuck, who were apparently to get married on air (Gay groups applauded the decision, saying it was a good way to introduce homosexuality to audiences. They must have missed the fact that they were evil homosexuals, who then declared the wedding a publicity stunt). So, it’s actual surprising that Vince hasn’t gone for a mentally impaired wrestler before.  It also looks as if they are going a different way than “Let’s laugh at the ‘tard”. Last night’s RAW had him displaying a ‘Rain Man’ like ability to recite facts and figures of the Intercontinental Title’s history. So, it looks like he will be stupid outside the ring, but a killing machine inside.  Apart from how offensive this role could be seen in the eyes of some people, there is another issue. The WWE has a development territory, where they send the young wrestlers off to learn, called OVW. OVW has done well in the previous couple of years and has produced a number of wrestlers who have gone on to become big names or potential for the future. There was Brock Lesnar, a legit amateur wrestling champion built like a brick shit house, who became a World Champion within 6 months of his debut. Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas debuted as “Team Angle”, later to become “The World’s Greatest Tag Team”, before splitting. Benjamin is now being pushed as a rising star, with victories over the man the company is currently centred on, HHH. What set these wrestlers apart was that they had no real gimmick other than “They wrestle”. It looked like stereotypical gimmicks may be coming to an end.   In OVW, another big name was being mentioned as a future star. Nick Dinsmore was known as “Mr Wrestling” – his gimmick being that he was the embodiment of wrestling, with strength, speed and holds that could beat anyone. You’d think he would be a natural for the new batch coming through. However, he got passed over constantly. Then, it appears to get McMahon’s attention, Dinsmore suggested himself the Eugene character. Low and behold, a wrestling retard is of much more interest than a plain old wrestler.  While some may be outraged by the character, I feel most people who’ve watched wrestling for the past few years aren’t that bothered, because, quite frankly, in 2002, the WWE produced an angle so offensive, so ridiculous and so insulting, it’s going to take a hell of a lot to beat it:   The Story of Katie Vick  or  Kane Fucks A Corpse    “The WWF does not do murder and rape” – WWF Investors Report   A bit of a backstory to lead up to the main details. In April 2002, the WWE split into two ‘brands’ – RAW and Smackdown, which would be separate entities but share the main titles. The WWF Championship could be defended on both shows and the champion was free to appear on any show to start new feuds. In August 2002, Brock Lesnar defeated The Rock to become the WWE Champion, decided he would remain loyal to the Smackdown brand and never appear on RAW and it looked as if his next opponent would be The Undertaker. Then, back stage politics became involved.     HHH, in real life, had become engaged to Stephanie McMahon, the daughter of Vince McMahon and lead writer for the WWE. This meant that for a lot of the time, the entire booking was centred around HHH, to the point that he picked up the nickname PoocHHHie, based on the dog added to Itchy and Scratchy in a Simpson’s episode (‘When Poochie is not on scene, everyone should ask “Where’s Poochie?”’). He was unhappy at not being Lesnar’s next opponent, so the writers came up with Lesnar sticking with Smackdown, splitting the brands, and having the Intercontinental Championship promoted to RAW’s main title. This also upset HHH, who saw the IC belt as a lesser title, so demanded a new one. So, one week after Lesnar left RAW, Eric Bischoff re-introduced the old WCW belt (which had been combined earlier with the WWF belt, renamed in the World Championship and presented it to HHH. Yes, he was GIVEN a belt. He didn’t win a tournament or anything, he was handed it, despite not being in a title match for four months. Now, RAW had another problem – who would fight HHH for the belt? He had destroyed nearly every opponent, leaving no one on RAW with any credibility to challenge for the belt. Luckily for the writers, one guy was coming back.     Kane, a legitimate 7’ tall mask-wearing monster, had suffered a serious arm injury that had kept him out for a while. In the summer of 2002, he came back with a new mask and a new attitude. No longer was he the hideously scarred freak who hated the world – he was now a full-lovin’ kind of guy who wanted to represent the “freaks of the world”. He won the IC belt and was on quite a role. Despite being crappily written for years, due to his size, he was always a credible threat. He became the perfect guy to fill the challenger role. But, of course, in the land of the WWE, there had to be another reason to fight than the Title. There had to be a reason for these men to hate each other.  At the end of a TLC (Table, Ladders and Chairs) match on RAW for the WWE Tag Titles between RVD/Jeff Hardy, Chris Jericho/ Christian, The Dudley Boyz (Spike and Bubba) and Kane and The Hurricane, Kane climbed a ladder to grab the titles suspended above the ring to win the titles for his team. What a great way this would have been to end RAW. However, it was known at the time that only one man could have the last word on RAW, and here he came, with a mic. And the stupidest angle in history was born.   "Kane, I promised you that before this night was over, your life would never be the same. You said this is the happiest you've ever been in your life, huh? Well unfortunately, some people always can't be that happy. Lemme ask you a question, Kane - how happy is Katie Vick? Yeah, that's right - I know, Kane. I know it all. Ten years ago...you killed her. That's right, Kane. You...are a murderer.”   What was going on? Who was Katie Vick? What did Kane do? How the fuck did HHH know this, if no one else seemingly had a clue? ‘Luckily’, Kane was ready to fill in the blanks on the next RAW. You see, Kane went to a party with the young Katie Vick 15 years ago. Being a gentlemen, he kindly offered to drive her home afterwards. However, as he was unused to a stick-shift car (I shit you not, this was all said on WWE TV), they crashed, killing Katie.  Now, this was stupid. If we are to believe the original WWE storyline of Kane, he was scarred in a fire that killed his parents and kept in a basement by Paul Bearer, who later claimed to be his father. Paul Bearer told Kane the fire was started by his brother, The Undertaker, and trained to Kane to become a wrestler and exact revenge for his parents’ death. So, now we are to believe that Paul let him out of his prison for parties? And if so, did he go wearing his mask? If this is a ‘real life’ story, why does Kane wear a mask? But, wait! Before we can get confused, guess who makes an appearance.   "Oh, boo hoo, Kane. Boo hoo. You've got me all choked up with your touching story, Kane. But since you're out here baring your soul, why don't you tell the world the whole truth? Why don't you tell the world how, when the people from that party were questioned, they all said that you were drinking, too, Kane? Why don't you tell everybody how, when the police got to the accident scene, there were empty beer cans in the car and all around the crime scene. And more importantly, Kane, why don't you explain to the world how, when doctors did the autopsy on Katie Vick's body, the doctors found *your* semen? That's right, Kane...oh, Katie Vick was a whole lot more than just a 'friend' to you, wasn't she, Kane? The fact is you loved Katie Vick. You were *madly* in love with Katie Vick. The problem was, Katie Vick LIKED you - she didn't love you, Kane. Katie didn't share your 'special' feelings that you had. Come on, Kane, honestly, who can blame her? Look at you. Who could realistically love a burnt-up freak like you? Now, Kane...I know that you weren't charged with murder, I know you weren't even charged with manslaughter. But Kane, facts are facts. And the fact is... Kane, the fact is that all this points to you. You know it, I know it, and the whole world knows it. YOU - KILLED - KATIE - VICK. But Kane, the question I have is...on that night, did you...force Katie Vick to have sex with you while she was alive... or did you just wait, and do it to her when she was dead?"   Here’s a question – how the fuck did HHH know all of this? From the police file? And if that was the case, why is Kane not in jail?  So, the match which started off between the hated HHH and the newly popular Kane was now a match between HHH and a guy who either can’t drive or is a murderous necrophile. Lovely. And guess what, the match at the PPV led to HHH defeating Kane to retain the title to little crowd interest (especially if you consider the equivalent match for Smackdown on the same show was a bloody Hell In The Cell match between Lesnar and The Undertaker). But, it couldn’t end there, because HHH still needed an opponent.  The next week on RAW, HHH claimed to have a video that would prove that Kane really was an evil murderous villain. And this, copied from CRZ’s report of the show, is what we got:   Graphic: "WARNING The following scene contains material that may offend some viewers. DISCRETION IS ADVISED"   Graphic on tape: "10/09/92 2:30am" Looks like a funeral home, complete with open casket. Why there'd be a cameraman here is anybody's...ohhh, never mind. I got it. "Hello. It's me, Kane. Is anyone here?" Well, it's not Kane entering the room - it's Triple H dressed up in a Kane mask and "BIG FREAK'N MACHINE" T-shirt. He approaches the coffin. "Hello, Katie. God...you look so good. Katie, you might look better - dead - than you did alive. You know, Katie...it didn't have to be like this. You didn't have to die. If you'd'a just given me what I wanted - if you'd'a just let me touch you...Katie, in that car. If you'd'a just...touch your beautiful breasts, then I wouldn't have swerved and gone off the road. And you would still be alive. Yes you would. Y- Yes you would - don't - no. N-- you would, too, you would still be alive and it's your fault. That's right. That's right, it is your fault, and you know it. 'cause I loved you, Katie - and you - you didn't love me when you were alive, because I was...some burnt up freak. What's that? Really? Now that you're...you're dead, you want me? I want you too, Katie. I've always wanted you, Katie. Look at you. I want you more than ever now - in your cheerleader uniform. I used to watch you bounce up and down. Your panties...would show. You know....if you want me, and I want you then there's no reason that...we shouldn't...be together." Picture gets pixellated where he feels her up. "Ohhhhh yeah. You like that, huh. Shhhhhhh. Don't be too loud. Your parents are next door, Katie. The other hand too? Ohhhh yeah. That's good. You know, Katie...you feel kinda stiff. Speaking of...stiff...maybe....maybe I should do what I've always wanted to do. You want me to?" He removes his shirt. "Yeah, Katie, I thought you would - I thought you'd never ask, but...I understand now you - you can't resist me. Maybe you should take off some clothes, too, Katie - I mean - maybe... maybe I should... (removes bra) This'll help. I bet it feels good to have them free, doesn't-- ohhh yes it certainly does. You know, Katie...these panties that I always saw under your skirt...you won't need these... (he smells 'em - eww) - ohhhh, I love the smell of formaldehyde in the morning. Katie...I'm gonna give you what you want. And I'm gonna take what I always wanted." Fortunately, we're from the chest up as he drops trou...then climbs in the coffin, lifts a leg... "What's that? Oh, I'm going to. Yeah. I'm gonna give you what you always wanted, Katie - tell me how bad you want it - tell me - yessssss." We move to shots of flowers and candles and background music covering up the sounds of... oh who knows. "Oh - oh - oh, Katie - oh - who's your daddy, Katie, huh? That's it. Who's your daddy? Oh." Back to the picture as "Kane" sighs. "I hope that was as good for you as it was for me. What's that? I did? You're kidding me. I really did? I did? Oh my God...I did. I really did it! I really did... (displays - ugh) I screwed your brains out!" And he throws them on the camera lens.      Well, at least they warned people.  The result of this? RAW got little of the ‘controversial’ press that they were hoping for to boost ratings. Ratings, in fact, dropped as it progressed. The crowd didn’t know who to react to Kane, who was meant to be a good guy, and so remained pretty much silent. This left Kane to meander about in the storylines until he was un-masked last year (and guess what – he WASN’T scarred!). HHH was left with no opponents, resulting in the promotion of Shawn Michaels, who had come back in the Summer for a ‘one-time deal’ due to the fact that his back was falling apart, to full-time wrestler to offer any kind of competition.  However, if you ask people who worked with Vince at the time, you’ll find he considered it a success and thought the video of ‘Kane’ was the funniest stuff he’d ever put out on TV.  So you see, after this, retards’ wrestling doesn’t seem so bad.

      Hey, seen the adverts for the Van Helsing film coming out soon? Looks a decent action flick, right?     Well...  urlLink  http://www.aintitcool.com/display.cgi?id=17423    The point at which the audience cheered the loudest during the movie was when someone in the back shouted 'THIS MOVIE SUCKS NUTS!" That's a word for word quote too.  This is just an awful, awful movie.  Oh yeah, and Dracula has midget henchmen.  The most laughably ridiculous part has a werewolf magically setting a carriage on fire by crashing into it.  As we were walking out of the free screening my girlfriend turned to me and said, "I want my money back. I want my life back."  The plotting, dialog and acting in the Mummy movies is Shakespeare compared to what is on screen here.

      You think you have the world beat when it comes to pain, suffering and heartache, Lloyd? Here's the time-line of my pain:  August '77: Ian Harte is born January '96: Ian Harte debuts vs. West Ham Utd. April '04: Ian Harte for about the 10th time he's played against the guy, decides it's not worth marking Steve Stone. For the 10th time, Stone has a brilliant game against us.  So, that's pretty much it. With matches against Bolton (A), Charlton (H) and Chelsea (A), we're in real trouble. Our only hope is that Bolton and Chelsea have nothing left to really play for.   It may have been noted before that I am not convinced about Eddie Gray and his tactics. However, starting a game with two centre backs in midfield when we need to attack is not the best plan. It looks even stupid when both limp off, two midfielders come on (one of them, admittedly, Barmby) and we look to have some shape.  I notice that while your heart is ripped into many pieces, you've found the time to try fancy new filters and stuff to join pictures together ;).  =  The church is now booked and we have picked our hymns and Bible readings. TFMrs also has her flowers. I have a wedding ring despite the one I ordered being about 4 sizes too small for me, leaving me with the one in the window. It's all horribly coming together.  Right, for you lot who are coming, it looks like most are arriving Saturday morning. If this is the case, I'll book in the same hotel as my parents in Spalding for Friday night. The hotel I have found which ain't a bad price and location is The Red Lion and is £27 per person per night B&B. They have double/twin/single rooms available. If you want that hotel, they can be found in the phone book. I guess it's now organise it between yourselves, but if you need a hand, give us a bell or e-mail. Just make sure you're about Saturday morning to check in and get changed into suits.  =  Saw Kill Bill Vol 2. last night. It is great but not quite as great as Vol 1., mind. I can't wait to see them back-to-back. I'll probably do a big ol' right up later, but I have work at the moment (No, really!).  =  The one thing I like about Sky Sports is their expert analysis. When Delia Smith was interviewed about Norwich's promotion on Soccer Saturday, she appeared to be complete nuts, and professed her love for Jeff Stelling and Rodney Marsh. As it finished, George Best pipes up "Sound's like Delia's had a liquid lunch!". And if anyone was to know about that...  =  Before I go - Is this the most disturbing picture ever taken?

       -Women. You get emotionally involved with them, and what do they do? -They rip your heart out of your ass!   Ever had a girl tell you she loves you? Yeah? Of course you have, you handsome devil you. Ever had a girl tell you she loves you on the same day she marries someone else?  So today was the wedding of my ex. Well, I say 'ex'.... just read on, and please, any advice you've got, leave a comment. Bonus points if you can tell me where the quote at the top comes from.  Story so far:    Nov '03 - start going out  Dec 23 - she tells me she's accepted a marriage proposal from another guy  Jan-Feb - break-up / get back together x4, 5 (lost count). She says she's unsure about getting married because she doesn't love the guy  March - she decides she'll marry him, for her parents (who already told everyone in Korea about it, plus they spent 10 grand on a new car for the bastard back in January, but guess who didn't find out about that until the end of March)  April - numerous occasions where she'd call me / turn up at my place in tears because he's a complete cunt and she doesn't want to marry him, but it's too late because her parents would "die of shame" if they pulled the plug on the wedding now  April 25 - wedding day   I originally intended to tell you all about the workings of the Korean wedding ceremony in all its gruesome vulgarity, but I took like 30 pictures and I don't want A-MOL bitching about loading times. Don't worry, there's still a shitload of pictures, Haigh. Heh.  So, this morning I received the following text messages:     The letters in Korean are the names of two of my female friends. She gets really pissed off and jealous if I hang out with them, yet she expects me to understand that she's marrying another guy. Moving on....     Before the ceremony (yes, before!) the couple poses for shots. After I took this picture I got asked to pose with the bride, and after waiting 15 seconds for me to smile, it finally dawned on the photographer that no amount of lively gesturing was going to make me smile, so she took the picture anyway. Bet it's great...     Clockwise from top-left: Bride walking into the hall, having just seen me; mothers doing something odd at the front; minister / MC getting ready while girls with odd hats tell the mothers to do something, probably; pretty crap blurry picture.  I should apologise for the wild variations in lighting, plus the fact that my crappy software blurs the pictures when I try to reduce the size. The reasons for the crap lighting was this arsehole:     He was giving everyone the Nazi interrogation treatment throughout the whole ceremony, fucking up most of my photos in the process. Also note a) smug bastard, whose facial expression didn't change throughout; b) how incredibly miserable she looks. Want more proof?     The fact that she kept glancing over in my direction the whole time was a bit of an insight into her thoughts.  Of course, I was mightily pissed off all the way through, but one thing did make me laugh.     The pic on the left shows the cake-cutting. Note: a) again, pissed off; b) neither the bride nor the groom (who we hate, by the way) get to cut the cake. This privilege is given to some random woman. The pic on the right shows that only the top layer was a real cake. Presumably they wheel out this fake cake for every wedding they hold there (there was another scheduled 50 minutes after this one began).  And, for the girls, here's one last picture of the wedding dress. You can't tell, but it was a kind of ivory colour.      Since the ceremony finished I've received a couple more texts from her along the same lines as the ones shown above. They're off on a weeks' honeymoon to Paris / Switzerland leaving tonight, and when they get back, he's off straight to the USA for a 10-day work thing, and she's invited me to stay at their new apartment while he's gone.  I'm unbelievably pissed off and confused by the whole fucking situation (hence the reason why I'm in a PC room on a Sunday afternoon spelling it out for you). Any thoughts?  ______________________________________   In other news, the Alkaline Trio / One Man Army split CD is incredible.

      I've been saying it for a while, and finally it looks like there is agreement - there are a lot of deadwood characters in Hollyoaks who deserve to be cleared out. The producers have decided to get rid of 14 people this summer in a major incident (from the writers of Brookside, remember), after already removing long-standing characters, Mr and Mrs Cunningham. However, they seem to have gone a different way to what I would have done.   The past year has seen the yearly intake of students, which this year produced some of the worst actors ever seen on the show. One of the students, a slightly mongloid looking girl, brought along her twin and mixed-race family, which was also populated with piss-poor actors. My method - cut your losses on these, concentrate on the established actors.  Here's a list of those for the chop.   Izzy Davies      I wasn't going to put any pictures up, but... well, y'know...   This is a major cut. Elize Du Toit probably feels she can go off an do other stuff now, so they will not have had much of an option.   Scott Anderson  Fair enough, since he hasn't been given a decent storyline for donkeys' years. He'd be a decent guy to keep as he adds a bit of slime and menace.   Nick O'Connor Kristian Hargreaves Chloe Bruce  Fair enough - this could easily be done by having them graduate. It does kill off the Only Gay In The Village, mind, which I thought they wouldn't do, since homosexuals are soap vogue this year.   Robbie Flynn  Hurrah! Bye-bye to one of the deadweight students.   Lisa Hunter Lee Hunter Sally Hunter Les Hunter  Now this is odd. The Hunter family have been built up for a few years, with drama after drama. It seems odd to do all this and then get rid, especially keeping Dan and Ellie Hunter, Ellie's character being dead in the water now after her serial-killer husband storyline has finished, and not the other Hunter siblings (i'll go into this further later on)   Norman Sankofa  Quite frankly, in television terms, he was on borrowed time the minute the mixed race family came in with three (count 'em, THREE!) black people. A pity, because he's a decent character.   Zara Morgan Cameron Clark Abby Davies  Norman, Lee and Lisa overlap into this group and the one I don't understand. They are all taking there A-Levels this summer, so surely it would be easy to have them be the students for the college this year. Considering they all have relationships defined that can be played with, instead of what we get with students coming in usually (stilted dialogue and inexplicable character changes for the first 3 months). Everyone of them is good in their roles and have grown into them. And notice - Bombhead gets to fucking live! Why?  So, it looks like we are keeping the mixed-raced Mongloid family, the crappy students, the Dean family (entire chracter - "They're broke but want to spend money. Erm... that's it!") and my bete noire, Mandy Rchardson, the only character who could be abused, dumped and orphaned and still make you think she's a whiny bitch.  Me thinks I might be sleeping in in future on Sunday mornings.

      Well, this weekend is going to be busy. With TFMrs working late on Friday, we have to fit in the following into two days:  *See the vicar and reception people to agree on hymns, reading and fodder. *Watch Leeds vs Portsmouth at 11.30am, Sunday *See Kill Bill Vol. 2  I rented KBV1 last night to remind myself of the story and such before I see the second half, and fuck me, it's still absolutely awesome. There are just so many little bits I had forgotten that I loved, like GoGo's little wave and "Hi!" before she kicks The Bride's arse.  =  Few things in the news and stuff which sort of interest me. Bollocks to you if they don't interest you.  *Michael Jackson's going to court, baby! Let's face it, as unpleasant as the allegations are and as tired as we are of the stories, there is a certain curiosity that will make us watch this, if it does get shown on television (MJ's lawyers want to block it). We are going to get a view of some of the strange goings on that happened in Jackson's life and just what life at Neverland is like. Hell, we may even get to find out what the "identifiable mark" on his cock is (by the way, notice that's at least two famous people with ****s on their ****s. Has everyone's got something indentifiable? Could someone pick mine out in a line up?).  *A Take That reunion, eh? Bollocks. Doesn't it show a desperate time for the music industry that the biggest stories in British music news are rumours of a boyband and a girl band who split up nearly ten and five years ago respectively? Is the world really crying out for the return of Jason Orange and Howard Donald to the stage? And if it does occur, is this Robbie admitting that he'll have problems keeping up his end of the EMI deal (Didn't the silly tosser realise when he screamed "I'm rich beyond my wildest dreams!", it was essentially a loan that had to be paid back?) and that his dream of conquering the US is never going to happen?  *A comic book adaptation that has me worried - The Watchmen. After years of rumours and cancelled productions, it has been given the go ahead. While I do own a few 'graphic novels', I'm not the biggest comic fan boy. However, The Watchmen is genius. Set in the Cold War, it's an examination of the psyche needed to be a superhero and the responsibilities that come with power when trying to "save the world". It's complex and deep, with several undercurrents that it takes a couple of reads to notice. And now, Hollywood want to cash in on it. Considering the last Alan Moore book turned into a film, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen was essentially rewritten to become a Sean Connery action vehicle, you have to wonder how they would do this. The main problem is that to include anywhere near the amount of story for it to work, the film will be over four hours long. The only hope I have is that two names keep being mentioned - Terry Gilliam to direct and Robert De Niro to play The Comedian, a disillusioned, old, right-wing superhero.  Right, I have to keep up the pretense of work, so off I go. In the meantime, here's a picture of a squox and a squino (yesterday was declared Squirell Shopping Wednesday on b3ta).       =  And as I write, another Front Page! This one is really undeserved - a picture based on the story that a US channel was going to show pictures of Diana from the car crash.     I think I must have joined a clique or something!

      Well, one half of possibly the worst commentary team on TV has been sent home early doors. Mind you, while many truely hate Clive "I remember another game with two late substitutions in it, in Barcelona..." Tyldesley, people always quite liked the bizarre terminology that came out of Ron Atkinson's mouth. However, I think his latest observation about Marcel Desailly may be a bit too much for some:   "He's what is known in some schools as a fucking lazy thick n*****"      Yes, I don't usually edit sentences like it's a footballer's text message, but, let's face it, it's not pleasant and considering the apparent sensitivity of the Google search up top, I don't want links for the BNP and the films of Charlton Heston.  While he did not make this comment during the live game, he was picked up by a Gulf Sports channel using the ITV feed and clearly heard by the viewers. Of course, this isn't the first time that this has happened to him...   "He's a little twat, that Totti. I can't see what all the fuss is about."      The wise words of Big Ron, picked up last year by German TV.   Of course, Ron has come out to try and defend himself. He described his comment as a 'momentary lapse'. To suggest that racism is something that you have to struggle to keep under control usually isn't the best way to go. Like, say, Ian Huntley had a 'momentary lapse' in his struggle not to abuse young girls. And:   "If you look at my track record as a manager, I was one of the first managers in the game to give black players a chance."      I hear some of his best friends are black, too.  As a memory, then, of our fallen hero, here is a  urlLink guide  to remind us that Champion's League commentary may improve, but it may be a lot duller.

         If you're sick of the relentlessly tedious crap being peddled on 24 hour news channels about George W., why not check out these two sites:   urlLink Punkvoter.com , founded by  urlLink NoFX's  Fat Mike, aims to remove the "idiot son of an asshole" (his words, not mine) from office ASAP. Backed by a bunch of bands (most, rather suspiciously, on his own Fat Wreck Chords label), Punkvoter's latest means of spreading the word is the Rock Against Bush compilation (pictured above), featuring 26 bands contributing (mostly) new material.   The website itself is a rapidly expanding and fairly eye-opening read. Of particular note is the special guest columns, written by such luminaries as Jello Biafra (Dead Kennedys), Billy Gould (Faith No More) and Jesse Michaels (Operation Ivy / Common Rider).  On the other side of the coin,  urlLink conservativepunk.com  was founded as a direct response to punkvoter.    "This site has been created to counteract the multiple liberal punk sites on the web, which are run by only a small number of punk artists who are choosing to make up the minds of thousands of voters."   Unsurprisingly, in it's early days the site was little more than an attack on Fat Mike's political views, without having a clear manifesto of its own. Recently, guest columns / interview from the likes of Dave Smalley (Dag Nasty / Down By Law), Michale Graves (Misfits) and Johnny Ramone (duh) have upped the credibilty (and quality) of the site, while a number of eye-opening pieces about John Kerry are available for your viewing pleasure.     The most entertaining story to emerge from either of these two sites concerns the Rock Against Bush comp. Originally, widely-outspoken "progressive thrash" band  urlLink Propagandhi  were asked by Mike to contribute to the comp, and so the band offered their song "Bullshit Politicians". Not a bad choice, you may think, but in the liner notes the band included " This message was not brought to you by George Soros ". In Fat Mike's words:   George Soros is a Billionaire who got his money from exploiting the foreign currency exchange. He screwed a bunch of countries to make his money. It is also important to note that he is also a member of the Carlyle Group, which is a company that makes money from selling weapons. Okay, that sucks.   Mike also points out that Soros donates to organisations that help support punkvoter. In other words, Soros is sponsoring punkvoter (indirectly maybe, but the fact remains). The upshot being, Mike asked Propagandhi to remove the comment, they told him to fuck off, he removed the song from the comp. Cue dozens upon dozens of comments  urlLink here  and  urlLink here  criticizing Mike and punkvoter.   The whole thing's like a mini soap opera based around a bigger soap opera. Of course, there's a lot of bullshit written by both sides (and an amazing amount of bullshit written on punknews, easily the biggest collection of morons ever gathered on the net, but hey, I don't go there for the message boards), but as Mole's A-MOL Files shows, apparently there's a shite load of bullshit being broadcast on the mainstream news.  I also think it's funny that someone who sings about having sex with a quadriplegic on his band's latest album has such grand aspirations of changing the voting habits of the youth of America. Having said that, our conservative friends are no better. This is the official conservativepunk.com mission:   1. To inform today's youth that identify themselves with the punk scene with the facts, rather than rumor and conspiracy theory. 2. To encourage today's youth to register to vote and become engaged in politics. 3. To encourage youth voters to draw there own conclusions rather than indoctrinate them into a certain way of thinking.   Presumably, 'to encourage today's youth to use correct spelling' is somewhere near the bottom of 'there' to-do list.

         Well,  an urlLink  intruiging thread on b3ta  this afternoon. Editted highlights:   Sanks:  Nick Nack /Maradona picture? Anyone know who did it...   Stickman_ben:  That would be the Rev A mol.    Sanks:  argh IS he around today... Someone I know wants to run the image on a t-shirt   Me:  For money-cash or what? Shit, should have tagged it.   Sanks:  Sorry. A mate of mine wanted to run it on a t-shirt... BUt he's bottled, I was trying to get you something for it, he sent me a viral. And I saw it on B3ta first. So I was trying to get you some gravy.... Now's he doesn't want to do, soz   Woo Tang Clan: it is flying around on e-mail. Got sent it this afternoon from someone  So, it seems that I've made a picture that's gone down well not only with b3tans, but people in general. I have made an image that several browsers have decided is funny enough to pass on to their friends and fellow colleagues.   That's pretty damned cool.  I wish I had tagged it now. I may start doing so in case I make a really great one. It's worth doing, as famously found when a b3tan image (Argentinians with handbags) got picked as  urlLink the front page of The Mirror  without credit.

      Got those from  urlLink The Guardian  this morning.   In 1986 I took my first trip to New York. I had no plans for the length of my stay and assumed it would last about as long as my finances - which would have made it quite brief. As it turned out, they lasted longer than I thought. I was living in Williamsburg and, though it's quite the place now, at the time it was relatively cheap and run down. The longer I stayed, the more I liked it, until I didn't want to leave at all. So, when my means eventually did run out, I accepted a job with some Puerto Rican carpet layers I met through a guy in my building called Oscar. He was the leader, or foreman, of the gang.  Oscar, on discovering I was an artist, asked me to paint his portrait. It was when he came up to sit for me and found me on my knees, still stretching up the canvas with a staple gun in hand, that he suggested I work for him laying underfelt.  My first job was up in Harlem, and I remember thinking: "Hmm, that's a tough part of the world." Driving up that sunny morning, though, I was struck by how beautiful the buildings looked, especially the one we were contracted to work in. It was a huge top-to-toe renovation for some guy in the music business whose identity was a kind of secret. There was a lot of speculation among the gang as to who he might be, and by mid-morning a consensus had grown that it could be Afrika Bambaata.  Shortly before lunch a smart house keeper came up to say there was soup in the kitchen if we liked, and that it had been prepared the night before by ... what did she call him now? The owner? Something mysterious. It was his wish, she told us, that we all partook of it because he prided himself on his soup, and because it appealed to his sensibility to share - or words to that effect.  This seemed to cap speculation that it was indeed Afrika Bambaata, because apparently that was just the kind of guy he was. I couldn't say, really, because beyond his music, which I liked and still do, I knew nothing of him. If it was him, I now know he makes delicious soup, too - more of a stew really.  Afterwards, back in the huge room - empty, save for the fresh felt underlay - I felt a very Joseph Beuys kind of calm and so, while the others smoked outside, I relaxed against the wall with my book: Jimmy Saville's autobiography Love Is an Uphill Thing. I'd just reached the chapter in which Jimmy came to invent the "twin-decks" by paying a local metal worker to weld two domestic record decks together for more continuous play at his dance parties in Leeds. In so doing, he potentially became the first DJ.  When the rest of the gang trooped back in, Oscar, as though he had been put up to it, came over and said: "Hey English guy, where ju get your cardigan?"  "In a thrift store, in Red Hook," I said.  "Ah," he said. "'Cause it looks like a mental patient's."  "OK," I said, and went back to the book, aware of the gang laughing in the background.  These guys were all very hot up on A: upfront sports gear, what rocked, what didn't. I knew my cardigan wasn't rocking. I wasn't trying to let the side down or anything, it's just that this was during the emergence of the Beastie Boys and there was a lot of opinion about them being white and inauthentic-looking in that kind of gear. But this wasn't the reason I resisted wearing trackies and gold chains. Somehow, whenever I saw white kids in Manhattan dressing "a la Beastie" I had an uncomfortable twinge that was nothing to do with white kids assimilating black youth culture, but related to something much more familiar to me, almost cosy in its familiarity - reminiscent of something traditional like warm beer or fish and chips.  Until then it had been only subliminal, but as I leafed through the photos in Jimmy Saville's book I suddenly realised what it was I was being reminded of. It was Jimmy Saville himself - or rather, his style.  In nearly all the pictures he wore tracksuits coupled with chunky gold jewellery. As I fanned through his career, the tracksuits became more flamboyant (handmade, in fact), the jewellery bigger, the look darker, meaner, with wraparound shades.  The book was a signed copy dedicated to my old neighbour, Joyce, a cleaner at St James's hospital in Leeds where Jimmy made frequent visits. Even the signature struck me as very rap: he used a pound sign for the J of Jimmy and a dollar sign for the S of Saville.  The back cover showed JS or £$ outside Stoke Manderville hospital, where he did a lot of charity work. He was wearing a flashy tracksuit, and it looked as if he had redeemed every pledged gold chain from every pawnshop in Leeds and put it round his neck. In another shot he was leaning on a Rolls-Royce; yet another showed him standing in front of his twin decks. This particular photograph was credited as being taken in NY - not the "Big NY", but North Yorkshire - in 1973, a full decade before B-boy style got going in the States.  "Hey Oscar, mate," I said, "come over here a sec will ya, I want to show you something."  The carpet layers were just about to roll out the new red carpet over the fresh underlay. I felt this was an appropriate moment to announce Jimmy Saville as the leading exponent of rap style. Basically, I just wanted to get them all off my case by explaining that, where I came from, people had been dressing like this for years. Well, one had anyway - so, 'ows about that then!    Hard to disagree...

      From Ananova:   Knight Rider the movie?   David Hasselhoff is set to reprise his role as Michael Knight for a movie version of Knight Rider.     The big-screen version of the hit 80s TV series will see Knight's son take over driving the famous talking car, Kitt, while Hasselhoff's character will be a mentor figure.  According to Empire Online, Ben Affleck has been tipped to play the Baywatch star's son and Hasselhoff is keen for original actor William Daniels to return as the voice of Kitt.  He said: "I'm really excited about it. We're working hard to get it off the ground."  But Hasselhoff is concerned with how the cult TV show will transfer to the big screen.  He added: "We've taken it to a studio that, predictably, wants to change everything. I don't want it to be a joke version, like Starsky and Hutch. I think Knight Rider deserves a shot at something serious."    What are the odds of there being:   shit loads upon shit loads of Bruckheimer-style explosions  European bad guy  Michael Knight Jr.'s  smooth-talking black partner  More crap one-liners than you can shake a Schwarzenegger movie at   It's a show about a guy with a dodgy perm who drives a camp talking car. How serious does he expect the movie to be?

      Well, after my FP excitement, I guess it’s the usual time where I tell you about my weekend. Except, here’s the problem:  *I did fuck all *I don’t want to talk about the football on Friday or on Saturday morning, where Man U’s decay concerned me for the first time ever *My film watching this weekend extended to Alien and Aliens.  So, apart from the continuing amusement from the Beckham’s (the President-Elect of Real wants him out, he apparently sent a text to Ms. Loos about “crouchless panties”) and Kevin Spacey being mugged in a park in the early morning (out watching badgers like certain MP's, perchance?), not much to talk about.  So, I guess I’ll tell you about my new favourite game – Splinter Cell.     Oh, it is good. I like the odd bit of stealthiness, like Metal Gear Solid and Siphon Filter, but considering Siphon Filter was bollocks hard and MGS2 had less stealth, more talk about the nature of choice, I’ve been missing out. However, this is truly great.  It looks fantastic, and apart from the usual 3D problems (guns barrels protruding through doors), works well. The sound is fucking great and essential to the game (hear a slight electronic buzz? Be careful, there’s a camera about).  It all comes down to the gameplay, though. After the assault course at the start of the game, you’ll find the moves intuitive and be prepared for most of the situations in the game.  It does follow the same Metal Gear Solid formula – shooting through a level won’t work because one guard can easily kill you. There’s a handy light meter to tell you how visible you are and you have to be very careful when moving – the slightest sound can put guards on alert. Although smarter than the MGS guards, there are also some stupid moments – like when two were patrolling a room and kept meeting in the middle to discuss how quiet it was – the guard didn’t notice his mate was missing after I’d pulled him slightly into the corner with a gun against his head.  The level is difficulty is pretty hard, but not too hard – every time you die, you get a slight sense of where you went wrong.  One thing I have noticed, anyone who say the advert for it will remember the split-jump, which allowed you to raise yourself in a corridor, held in place by your feet alone. I haven’t found a single situation where crouching around a corner isn’t a better option.

      As if you needed any more reasons to hate / mock Nickelback, take a listen to this:   urlLink     Right-click on Chad's mug and save the file, listen to it, laugh/cringe/get bored, and then delete it right away*.  __________________________________  Finally got around to watching  Big Fish  after buying it from a dodgy bloke in Seoul. I put it in last week, but got pissed off when it skipped every 5 seconds. Gave it another chance though, and the skipping stopped after 10 minutes. Bitchin'. Short review: Forrest Gump - retarded guy + terrific bullshitter = Big Fish. The cast (Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney , Billy Crudup, Steve Buscemi, Danny Devito, Helena Bonham-Carter) is pretty damn good too.  __________________________________  Still on movies,  Kill Bill Vol. 2  is either fucking amazing or really dull, according to  urlLink  Rotten Tomatoes  :     "Simply one of the best films, period." -- Joe Baltake, SACRAMENTO BEE  "A powerhouse movie." -- John Anderson, NEWSDAY    "A film richer in every way than its illustrious, callow predecessor." -- Ty Burr, BOSTON GLOBE    "A rip-roaring, highly entertaining, extremely enjoyable continuation to Vol. 1." -- Paul Clinton, CNN    "Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is every bit as wild a joyride as its prelude, but packed with richer, more resonant characters." -- Colin Covert, MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE   or....     "When not being a colossal bore, Tarantino takes pleasure in offending our moral sensibilities with his adoring portrait of a natural born killer with a thirst for revenge." -- Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat, SPIRITUALITY AND HEALTH  "Vol. 2 slowly wears out its welcome with its empty oratory." -- Robert W. Butler, KANSAS CITY STAR    ""Kill Bill: Volume 2" commits the ultimate crime of being boring. What could have been one of the best action films of all time turns into a mediocre, frustrating film." -- Michelle Alexandria, ECLIPSE MAGAZINE    "An over-long exercise in resolution, denouement and style." -- Mike DeWolfe, APOLLO GUIDE    I bet those who thought it was dull were the same people who panned  Jackie Brown , which I thought was great. Can't wait for this to come out. This, and Harry Potter 3. And Hellboy. And Van Helsing.  __________________________________   Arsehole of the day - ex-gf's fiance. OK, so her parents have paid for: a new apartment, a new car for him, furniture, and the wedding ceremony. They're also buying him a laptop (Koreans also exchange rings, but since he's a doctor and can't wear his ring at work, he figured he'd get more use out of a laptop). He's paid for: the honeymoon. But wait! Yesterday he had a change of heart, called ex-gf and said that she would have to pay her half of the honeymoon. I'm not sure why, but I think it's because Koreans also buy clothes for each other when they get married (wtf  don't  they buy), and womens clothes are more expensive than mens. Now, it had always been agreed that this honeymoon (5 day trip to Paris / Switzerland - cost: about 1200 pounds per person) would be paid for by him, and as such her and her parents had not budgeted for this extra expense. Bottom line is... she'll have to take a loan out / borrow money from someone to go on her honeymoon. She turned up at my place in tears yesterday. She'll be marrying this absolute fuckwit in 6 days' time. I'll be there, taking pictures / superimposing his head on gay porn and distributing it throughout the Gwangju medical world.     *for the lazy, the mp3 is two Nickelback songs being played at the same time. I thought only Britney Spears and the Vengaboys could get away with crap like this.

      A quote from the completely lovely Ms Loos, who is prepared to fill in the blanks for us if the matter should ever go to court. How wrong is it the first thing I thought of when I saw that was "wart"? What a charming story she also told of the time that Beckham sent her a text message that would have the astericks key on many a News of The World journalist's keyboard buggered that she just had to pop into a museum toilet to "finish of there and then".  =  Tarantino as a guest judge on American Idol! Damn, I'm going to have to get my family to tape that. One highlight is Quentin pointing out exactly why "My Heart Will Go On" should be banned from the program.  Now, let's see if I can get past the next few months and wait for the Kill Bill box set, instead of jumping straight in and buying the basic Vol 1. disc.  Speaking of violent, bloody films:   My second gripe with the film comes right at the end, when He is Risen! It's a short sequence where we see the boulder shift out the way, and a healthy, engimatic Christ emerge from the darkness.   Oi, Les! No spoilers, you twat! I didn't come on here and tell everyone that they found Nemo, did I?  =  Well, yesterday was pretty good. I've ordered Dan's usher outfit for him (gone for a 40L jacket, which is the same width as me, but a bit longer) and bought potentially my new favourite game, Splinter Cell. However, something cooler happened yesterday.     GUESS WHO HAS AN OFFER FOR A PGCE COURSE AT LEEDS UNI, BITCH!  Hell, yeah. Went in, handed in my "Not a Paedo" form and a copy of my degree, had an essay to write based on some article in the TES and how it has implications for my subject (not that it mattered in the end) and an interview.  The best part of the interview is that it was the guy I talked to back in October, so he knew me pretty well anyway. The only things that could have changed his opinion was my GTTR application, but that looked better than expected thanks to my former University tutor's statement about me. He thinks I'm intelligent, a good communicator and a good worker, who doesn't show his true abilities in the exam situation (damned straight). I am quite surprised he could form these opinions, considering the number of tutorials I blew off for more important stuff (Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy IX etc...). Still, after asking what I thought of Westborough and if I had any concerns about teaching Biology up to Key Stage 3 (I said something about not studying it for 9 years, not my true burning question - "Will I have to talk about willies to thirteen year-olds?"), he said "Well, this is the part where I tell you you will get a response in the next couple of weeks, but I'll tell you now, we're giving you an offer".  They'll take any cunt at the minute, I guess.     So, that's a 9 month course starting in September, on a training salary of £6K. Apparently, I will be eligible for a Student Loan Payoff, which pisses me off since I've pretty much paid 60% of it off. Still, in my future, I guess I see Asda shelves, an usher's uniform or serving alcopops to pock-faced girls wearing Kappa and/or Burberry in Dewsbury.  =  Actually, not all of yesterday was that great. I need to replace my passport, which I lost moving from York to Dewsbury. TFMrs suggested I go to the Post Office, who check it for you and fast-track it off. So...   9am:  Walk up to the counter, to be served by Middle-Aged Woman. She tells me I need to fill out an LS01 form for a lost passport. I note it asks for a crime number. "Don't worry, sir. If you leave it blank, it will be fine." However, I have stupidly forgotten my brith certificate. As I leave the PO, TFMrs rings telling me she's heading into town to get her boots fixed. I ask her to bring the certificate.   9.10 am:  I queue up again and get sent to a window with a younger woman. She's checking everything then stops. "Have you a crime number for the passport?", "No", "We can't send it off then, sir". I explain that the earlier woman said it wasn't a problem. Said MAW comes to the window and says  I need a crime number or it will be rejected . I point out that this differs to her position 10 minutes ago, but she remains adamant. I need to contact the police.   9.30am:  Back in the flat, I call Dewsbury Police Station for a crime number. I get put through to Cleckheaton. "I'd like to report a missing passport", "When did you lose it, sir?", "Last January.", ".... well, .... you need to contact Dewsbury in person".   9.50 am:  I enter Dewsbury Police Station. No-one is at the desk.   10.05am:  An officer arrives at the desk. 15 minutes! I could have committed any number of crimes in that time! "Can I help you", "I'd like to report a lost passport", "Was it stolen?", "No, lost in a move, but I need a crime number to apply for a new one", "No sir , you need a Lost Property Number from the passport office"   10.15am:  "Hello, and thank you for ringing the Passport Service. We would like to make customers aware...."   10.20am:  "Hello, ca i take your name, sir"..... "No, sir. If you leave the form blank, we'll process it as lost rather than stolen.", "So, I leave the form blank?"....   10.40am:  I queue, I get the MAW. "Have you got a number then?"....   10.50am:  "There's your receipt, sir. Sorry for the confusion"  Two hours to hand in a form. Brilliant. It'd by easier if I was a Romanian, lesbian mother-of-three! (/Inno rant mode off)  =  Ah, bollocks to it. With the offer, I doubt anything will put me in a bad mood for the next few days...    urlLink Oh,right. Shit.  Well, it worked last time, so...  "Leeds'll win. Viduka, last minute. Monster!"

          Man in restaurant : We'd like a bottle of house wine, please.  Waiter : Certainly sir. Red or white?  Man in restaurant : What are they like?  Waiter : The white's a '97 Cabernet, quite fruity.  Man in restaurant : And the red?  Waiter : The red represents the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for all our sins.   Everyone and his dog knows at least 2 things about this film:    it's really, really bloody  there ain't a single line in English   The second one bugged me especially, since the wonderful Korean cinema industry decided to only show Korean subtitles (usually, in the case of LOTR / Last Samurai / most other movies involving a foreign language, they show both). In the end, it wasn't such a bad thing, as everyone knows how this story goes. The film covers a very short period in Christ's life; namely the end of it. Starting from Judas' betrayal, Jim Caviezel (Jesus) receives his first twatting bout 20 minutes in, and doesn't stop getting the crap beaten out of him for the next 100 minutes. The violence is the main thing that will stay with you after watching this film, most of it extremely graphic and disturbingly realistic. Caviezel (you may remember him from such films as Pay it Forward and The Thin Red Line)  is  Jesus, and is damn near unrecognisable from his other performances. Expect him to become a huge, huge star in the wake of this film's inevitable success at the box office. The other noteworthy performance comes from Bulgarian actor Hristo Shopov, who is awesome as Pontius Pilate.  So yeah... there's a lot of blood. The flogging scene, where Jesus gets the crap whipped, and then flayed, out of him is especially harrowing, leaving Jesus with not one square inch of skin which isn't either badly cut or soaked in blood. Mel Gibson's skill as a director is clear for all to see in scenes like this, but all of his films to date have had one major flaw; namely the pacing. Remember how long  Braveheart  was? Now, how much do you actually remember from that film? Probably the first and last 15 minutes, and the kickarse battle that takes place somewhere in the middle. The rest of the film dragged, and  Christ  follows the same pattern. After the flogging sequence (which rendered an entire Korean theatre completely silent, not an easy task), it takes 35 minutes for Jesus to drag his cross up the hill. 35 minutes of him looking agonised while Romans spit on him. 35 minutes! Gibson does break it up with flashbacks of the last supper, and other key moments in Christ's life, but these are few and far between, each lasting about 30 seconds. It's a dull, dull sequence, and they'd have done everyone a favour by cutting it by 20 minutes or so.  In contrast, the cruxifiction, and subsequent denouement, is excellently done. You've got to watch this in a cinema, or at least on a TV with a decent sound system, because the sounds of those nails going in will stay with you for a long, long time. My second gripe with the film comes right at the end, when He is Risen! It's a short sequence where we see the boulder shift out the way, and a healthy, engimatic Christ emerge from the darkness. Now, maybe I'm just jaded, maybe I've watched too much WWE, but right at the end I honestly expected him to look right into the camera, and say "King Herod, I will destroy you at Wrestlemania, for I am risen!" (caption: Wrestlemania AD33: The Saviour Returns). Just a little cheesy, Mel.  Other problems I have with the film - OK, so Satan's in it, but she (yes, it's a 'she) does very little other than look ugly and scowl. What was the point? Also, there was a cool part near the beginning, where Judas, haunted by his betrayal, starts seeing demons and shows signs of going insane, and then.... it stops, and we never see him again. Bugger.  All in all, worth seeing. Just go for a piss while Jesus is on his way up the hill, you won't miss much.

         First off, everyone should listen to the new  urlLink Pulley  album, or at least download an mp3 (there's 2 on the linked page). It's good shit, and the singer used to be a Major League pitcher.   Second of all, I write a lot of crap for this website, so as a token of gratitude, Mole, I want linkage to my  urlLink  2 favourite  urlLink  websites  on the right of this page. I'm sick of typing them in the address bar / wading through porn sites on my history to find them.  Just had to turn down the principal's invitation to dinner tonight, because I've got to leg it across town to get my phone fixed before the shop shuts. That's twice I've said no to him in as many weeks. Hmm, I wonder if that's the best way to butter up a guy and then say later "Oh, by the way, I'm leaving the country in a few weeks time for A-MOL's wedding. See ya". I might have to kiss some serious principal arse, starting from this Friday's field trip.

      One day last year, when TFMrs and I were lazing about the flat, she decided she was bored and wanted to go somewhere. She threw open a map of Yorkshire and pointed to a geographical feature called "Brigham Rocks", somewhere above Harrogate. Since it was 4pm, I said this was a very crap idea. So, we didn’t go that day, but every so often, she decides she wants to go when we have a free day. My main problems with such a visit are:  -	The Rocks are probably well off the very thin, spindly roads that appear on the map, and may involve walking. I have no problems with this, per se, but when it’s drizzling and cold outside, it’s just not worth it. -	TFMrs always suggest this visit when she has a day off. What she forgets is that she often sleeps past 2pm when she has a day off. -	She picked it when making an overdramatic, flouncy point.  So, yesterday, at 1pm, guess where TFMrs decides she wants to go. So I had a quick decision to make – a trip to the middle of fucking nowhere, or distract her by increasing our debt in the name of matrimony.  So, on the Monday after the wedding, we are off on honeymoon to  urlLink Greece  a week.  So, the plan for the wedding weekend or so is this:  Thurs – Pick up suits and various gubbings. Head down to Spalding  Fri – Sort out various last minute stuff. Rehearsal. Meet up with everyone at hotel. Few drinks, Euro 2004 preview program  Sat – Have argument with Dan about how he said his chest was only 29" and it’s his own damned fault. Church etc…  Sun – Head back home. Watch England v France (unsure of order)  Mon – Return suits; explain tears in Dan’s jacket. Head to Manchester Airport. Realise this is my first trip on a plane since September 11th, 2001. Freak out at first sight of turban.  Tue - Land in Corfu  =  Go see Shaun Of The Dead! Now!  =  Generally, apart from sorting out the suits, seeing Shaun Of The Dead (like you should – NOW!) and giving money to Airtours, not much has been happening. Football has going from liking me on Saturday, with a win over Blackburn, to hating me on Monday (it’s no good if everyone is getting good results at the bottom), so I’ll have to see how it feels about me today (v Everton, Leicester v Man U). I think I’m getting bored of Beckham and his extra-marital ****ing, though the absolutely cringe-worthy interview on Ant and Dec’s show with Posh, recorded two weeks earlier, was entertaining.  I have to prepare for my interview on Thursday, and I’m just resigning myself to admitting that I have no knowledge of biology since I haven’t studied it for nigh on 9 years. Still, as long as I don’t come out with anything too stupid or mention my problems with the Grimsby police back in my caretaking days, I’m sure I should be okay.

       Shaun Of The Dead      Shaun is stuck in a dead end job and spends his time hanging out with childhood friend, Ed, either at home playing on the Playstation or at the Winchester Arms. When Shaun suggests to his girlfriend,Liz, that they celebrate their anniversary at the Arms, she dumps him. After a night on the piss, Shaun decides to sort out his life and win Liz back. Unfortunately for Shaun, he picks the same day that a mysterious illness turns most of the residents of London into zombies.  This is the first film made by the team behind Spaced, a sitcom based on the life of a group of loser twenty-somethings, so essentially, this is Spaced with zombies.  Released a few weeks after the Dawn Of The Dead remake, it does seem quite sad for that film that just a few screens down is a film playing their 'terrifying scenes' for laughs. Whether it's Shaun and Ed realising they have a zombie in their garden ("Oh my God... she's so drunk!"), the attempted use of Shaun's record collection to decapitate zombies ("Stone Roses ?", "No!", "Second Coming ?", "Well, I liked it") or a character being ripped apart at by a group of zombies, these situations which would be played by anyone else for scares are just hilarious.  We get the usual smart wordplay mixed with tactically timed swearing that made Spaced so much fun and quotable. A lot of this comes from the interplay between Simon Pegg (Shaun) and Nick Frost (Ed), which works just as well as it did in the sitcom. There is also some great slapstick humour, involving the use of a cricket bat to try and combat the zombies and an inspired use of a Queen song during a fight scene.  There are also a couple of points in the film which are poignant and very sad, including one moment which I believe is the darkest moment ever to be included in a film called a comedy.     Basically, a lot of whether you like this film might depend on whether you like Spaced and similar comdies or not. With a cast that includes Dylan Moran (Black Books), Lucy Davies (The Office) and Jessica Stevenson (Spaced), as well as an inspired moment late in the film featuring cameos from multiple figures from UK comedy, it could end up feeling at times like a huge injoke.  So, considering it in this way, I think it has the potential to be one of my favourite ever films. It may not bear up under repeated viewing, but I really enjoyed it. Unsurprisingly for people who know me, jokes about a dead-beat mid twenty loser and the, at times extreme, black humour seemed pitched perfectly at me. I haven't laughed at hard at a film since I saw South Park.     When it comes down to it, yes, it's a feature length episode of Spaced with zombies. However, this adds up to a great British comedy film which, unlike many British comedies, does not have a message about pit closures or the decline of the steel industry or English people acting like upper-middle class twats who go ga-ga over the first American lass they see. It deserves to do well, which I think it will with word of mouth, and when you get a chance, go see it and enjoy one of the funniest, most original film in years.    5/5

      I don't like eyeballs. I really hate anyone touching anywhere near my eye. I tried for an hour and a half in Specsavers to put a contact lens in without blinking like a loon and failed miserably. When the woman helping suggested touching my eyeball without the lens on my finger, I nearly vomitted.   So, guess how I felt about the pictures of the new body modification available in Holland.     Called "Jeweleye", this process allows you to have shiny bits of crap implanted into your cornea.   For the love of God, WHY?

      First up –  urlLink Holy Moly Beckham Special   Second up – Jesus Fucking Christ, is my throat buggered from last night. I don’t think it’s ever suffered so much during a football match as it did last night. It wasn’t through singing, it was just from sheer screaming, shouting and cheering.  Ah, Leeds, the most wonderful Jekyll and Hyde team. While otheres, like Man City, can look like world beaters one game and ordinary hoofers the next, Leeds manage to make the change about every ten minutes or so. Unbelievable.  The game gets the perfect start – Leeds’ first two chances result in two goals. There was almost an inevitability to Duberry scoring – it just seemed it was a Duberry night. A great cross from Johnson, leaving Dubes to spring the offside trap and score an easy header. Swiftly followed by Viduka somehow getting a overhead kick in during a penalty box scramble, it looked like we were going to piss it. Except, of course, this is Leeds.  Viduka gets another, easier chance after 30 minutes. Scimeca slips, leaving Viduka all alone 35 yards out. In this situation, what would you do?  *Control the ball, bear down on the keeper and slot it under him. *Steady yourself and smash the ball into the top corner *Pass to the 18 year old wonderkid steaming in from the wing *Go for a big, aimless, balloony volley   If you chose the last, please find Mr P. Ridsdale, who will happily pay you £64k a week.  This smelt of the Birmingham game, where Viduka missed an open chance that would have put us in a great position and calmed the nerves. Alas, yet again, he fucks up the easy stuff while managing to do the hard stuff. It doesn’t help that, for the rest of the game, Ian Walker becomes brilliant. Three stops from Smith, all of which are top quality.  Then came the inevitable Leeds collapse. Both came from situation that Leeds should have been cleared. So the rapist and Izzet get one each and the crowd just TURN. Seriously, from all out support into raining abuse on everyone. People are calling for Gray’s head, none of the players on the pitch should play again for us, the works.  So, perhaps it’s easier to understand now why I pretty much managed to perform a self-tonsillectomy when Smith smashes the ball past Walker with 2 minutes left.  Blessed fucking relief, and I’m actually starting to believe we have a chance, have resigned myself to relegation a couple of months back. Mind you, we could do without the stupid stuff, like the lazy, fat one kicking the ball away in injury time when already on a booking, meaning he will miss another six pointer (a clich#&233 that doesn’t even make much sense) against Portsmouth.  =  In honour of Leeds winning, here's a Crystal Maze inspired lemming animation.     And while I'm posting pics, want to try and guess who this is?

      Man, that's not gonna get old for a while.  Fun weekend - went to Seoul, which is officially insane. Here's a few pictures that I didn't take, of the places I went to.        Dongdaemun, Seoul's biggest market / shopping area, looks like this all the time. It ain't a place for the claustrophobic, that's for sure. The actual main market doesn't open until 10pm (closing at 4am), and the main department stores close at 5am. Crazy.  The day we were there, they were putting on a free concert by all these Korean singers, so it was extra packed. Most of them were crap, but I did get to see the lovely  Diva  in the flesh.     Unfortunately, they were a) lip-synching and b) not wearing short skirts, so I got bored after a while.  At night, went to the testosterone fest of the Hongdae nightclub scene, which is full of big shaven-headed American GI's acting like twats and dry-humping small Korean girls on the dancefloors (seriously). Place was a bit of a dive, but I was too shitfaced to care.  Next day went to Yongsan, which is a huge electronics mecca. I just bought DVDs. More pictures? Go on then.        The building in the top picture didn't actually have any Transformers in it.  Broke my phone while I was up there as well. Bugger - no **** fun for me for a while. I'll have to think of other ways to satisfy my craving for hot ****** all covered in ****** ******. I've never **** so hard in my life.

      Ah, the joys of text messages.  Me: What time’s SF tomorrow? Fancy pub to watch Wragg: Dunno. At hospital at moment. Pops has suspected meningitis.  Turns out, it’s not meningitis; it’s something a bit weirder and unknown. She seemed to be getting better, if no a little drugged up yesterday, but she’ll be home today hopefully.   =  And on to the semi-final. That’s two games in two weeks between these teams which started off well and then became dull kicking matches. God knows how Scholes stayed on the pitch with his attempt to remove Reyes foot from his leg.  Anyway, it’s a true football master class tonight, with Leeds v Leicester. That’ll be good.  =  Kind of pissed off because on Friday, I bought the 2 disc version of Spirited Away and it’s fucked. The film plays and it is watchable, but at the changeover of the chapters seems to have been misaligned, meaning that the as the chapter changes, it jumps back about a second and you have a very jerky repeat of a couple of frames. I’ve tried two discs of it now, so it must be a general fault with all copies. Looks like a refund and waiting for the fixed copies to come out. It’s a real shame, because it’s such a good film (though the TFMrs. wasn’t so impressed. Probably Disney-rot of the brain, so films that don’t involve orphaned animals finding their place in the world just confuse her).   =  Just when I thought my top secret project had petered out…  …GUESS WHO’S GOT AN INTERVIEW AT LEEDS UNIVERSITY NEXT WEEK!  COME ON! So, I’ve spent £30 on GCSE/AS/A2 revision books in order to make sure my knowledge of the subjects is at the correct level (I haven’t studied Biology for 9 years, and I may have to teach it up to GCSE level).  =  On a final note, how good is it to finally have a credible story of David Beckham fucking around? And while people go on about his good character and clear love for her, can I remind people of the seemingly forgotten story of him dumping her for a stripper while she was pregnant with Brooklyn?  In case you wanted to know just what a footballer would talk to his PA about, here ya go...  B: When you start your job?  RL: Sign contract next week. Can't stop smiling jumping around.  DB: Happy for you. If you have any jumping around to do come here.  RL: Where?  DB: At the hotel?  RL: Which?  DB: Same one as last time - but a lot of Press today might not be a good idea. Maybe next time.  RL: OK will stop jumping and save it for when I see you and just keep smiling till then.  DB: OK you need to save all that energy for ****.  RL: Is it ****?  DB: Very, very ****, thinking of your **** and the *****.  RL: Remember the last time your tongue was all over me I have never **** so hard.  DB: Now I am doing something, thinking about your ****.  RL: ******* your ****, feeling you **** deep down my ******.  DB: Can't wait for that. When can we do this and where?  RL: It's difficult. You know best. Me always free.  DB: OK, we have to try.   The day before Real Madrid's 4-2 league defeat by Athletic Bilbao. Beckham instigates texting.   RL: U made me so horny the other day had nightmare trying to focus. U playing tonight?

RL: Well just think about it and when safe etc let me know...just u me in the dark alone... well candlelit dark.  DB: Not a problem, we will have fun.  RL: It was nice to hear u laugh. When I see u I want to hear u groan and moan. I can't wait.  DB: Don't worry, you will and I want to hear u scream.  Okay, here we go, a bit of engineering for anyone who can fill in these gaps with words unsuitable for publication but make sense   DB: OK you need to save all that energy for ****.  RL: Is it ****?  DB: Very, very ****   =  No Photoshoppping this weekend, I’m afraid. I’ve been too busy scratching my arse. Although, I did end up around at my parents helping Dad fix the car (MOT test due this week), went inside to flick on Sky and found The Wresting Channel! While I was there, I managed to see independent US wrestling (Ring of Honor), modern UK wrestling (FWA, which was awesome. Great matches and a commentator with the catchphrase “Bloody hell!”), 80s UK wrestling (KENDO NAGASAKI, BITCH!) and Irish wrestling! The greatest TV channel. Ever.  =  EDIT: Well, I may not have done any this weekend, but here's this morning's efforts.

      Design a simplistic, cute little character (y'know, eyes and stuff)....     and create a simplistic background for an animation.      Then decide "Hang on, I can make better backgrounds with Inventor 8, my 3D CAD software" and Bob's your uncle.            I'm now looking for new stuff to do with the little buggers.

      Well after the shock of waking up yesterday morning at 3am with blood dripping out of my ear, it's good that I can read something that brings a smile to my face. It's probably a bad thing that this something that interests a 25 year old engineer combines computer games and fake fighting.   Def Jam Vendetta  - a great game I managed to get of Les for a few quid once he tired of it. It's basic premise (rap stars twat each other) is fun, if somewhat potentially limited (especially if you only have a limited number of real-life star names appearing in the game), but the game succeeded because at the heart was a surprisingly sophisticated wrestling engine. Based on the AKI Corp system, used on the N64 for the WCW games (i.e. "Random button pressing" &#169 Andy J), the game allows for strategic fights which you often have to think about to win (i.e. the different style of fight you have to try to beat a small, fast guy compared to beating on a fat man), and allowing the player to focus on a body part to weaken the player and make them submit. The use of this system shit THQ, makers of the Smackdown series, up, making them revise their system and turn from an arcade style fighter to a similar realistic style. So, since Smackdown rose to the challenge, it's Def Jam/ AKI's turn to respond.      Electronic Arts is again partnering with urban music and lifestyle powerhouse Def Jam to bring gamers Def Jam VENDETTA II (working title), the ultimate hip-hop-fueled fighting video game. Currently in development under the EA GAMESTM brand, Def Jam VENDETTA II features more than 70 characters, including more than 35 of the most well-known artists and personalities in hip-hop today, including Busta Rhymes, Carmen Electra, Lil' Kim, Ludacris, Method Man, Redman, Sean Paul, Slick Rick, Snoop Dogg, and many more.  Def Jam VENDETTA II challenges players to step into the shoes of a ruthless NYC street fighter battling for control of the hip-hop underground. The game features an all-new fighting engine allowing gamers to customize multiple fighting styles as the deep new story mode takes the action well beyond the ring and into the streets.   Well, that's one of the problems sorted out straight away - a bigger selction of real rappers. Busta Rhymes! And of course, the man about to become a "most selected character" to rival the Brazilian guy on Tekken 3, SNOOP DOGG  However, one name stands out...  Sean Paul  That pussy arsed Beenie Man wannabe? What a load of shite.  Still, shit-reggae-for-12-year-council-estate-glueheads-to-lose-their-virginity-to singers aside, this game should kick all kinds of arse.  =  Ah, the great ways to spread the word of our Lord...      urlLink The Brick Testament

          MC Mong.  I guess all the best 'MC' names have been taken - Hammer, Lyte, Escher. In Korea we already have MC Sniper and MC The Max - great, great names - but MC Mong is surely the most comedy. In case you're unsure of the meaning, check it out  urlLink here  and  urlLink here , at arguably the world's most respected online dictionary.  What does he sound like?  A really crap cross between Shaggy and Coolio. I've also seen him on TV a lot, so he might well be Korea's answer to Richard Blackwood.  Just take a look at the chorus from his latest (and probably only) hit song, 180 Degrees. (Translated by  urlLink Babelfish , arguably the world's most respected translator).  " As the report fool whom it will carry the people tease and the unit the anyone the who cannot and disregard (it spreads out but to do well) the lower part end without also the bamboo sword rice does not become and there is not an after sliced raw fish, difficulty the Hey Hey Hey song department to be happy lu tax"   Catchy.      In other news, I'm continuing to be treated with utter disregard by the majority of this nation's women, as well as all the foreign women who live here. Yay!

      Still suffering, but I was a brave little soldier and ate some potato wedges yesterday. I'm still tired and have an incredible headache, so off to the doc's for a note.  Mind you, I did violently vomit yesterday. Not due to illness, mind:  "There could be no better club to join than Manchester United"  Oh, you stupid twat, Smithy.     Some twat, celebrating scoring against his new club.  =  We have paid for the reception! Get in. It actually came in under our estimated bill by a few hundred, which is a huge bonus. So, what will you be eating if you come?  Melon - Lincolnshire Hog Roast OR Meditteranean Vegetable Tart - Apple Pie  You'll get some free wine too, as well as champagne or Bucks Fizz before the meal.  =  Part of my brave little soldier routine yesterday was a trip to the White Rose Centre to pick up various gubbins. So, now we have our honeymoon tickets, The Return Of The King on DVD, my suit sizes for Danny's wedding and I've bought my main present for my niece - a baby monitor, which also measures temperature and acts like a nightlight.  The baby looks like it's got it's first year sorted out. There are piles of clothes, a pram, car seat, a modified baby bath, various cuddly toys and blankets all waiting in the future nursery/ current guestroom/ MY ROOM.  If the immediacy of my wedding isn't scary enough, Jo has been told that Imogen (it's stuck, I think it's final) is moving into the correct birthing position, which seems a bit soon with her not being due for 5-6 weeks. Mother already has plans to take an overnight bag and materniy details down to Spalding just in case.  =  A quick thing before I go - while the Academy were busy wanking themselves sore over Lord Of The Rings' art direction, costumes and visual effects, did they not stop and go "Hang on a minute, Sean Austin is a bit fucking good". Watching it again, how he did not get nominated, let alone win, Best Supporting Actor, is beyond me.

      What a lovely way to start the week – sickness and diarrhoea from either a stomach bug or food poisoning. It got so bad that I couldn’t hold down water! Still, I have found the guaranteed method to get a doctor to take you seriously – vomit into their sink during the appointment.  So, I now have a lot of drugs to keep myself somewhere close to well, but they still have me feeling like shite. Still, hopefully, I’ll be ill enough to get a doctor’s note for the week tomorrow and will be well enough for the stag do.

       urlLink Proof that there is nothing original anymore.  Still, I liked A-MOL's better.  ************     While the world worries about Iraq, and more civilians die on a regualr basis, spare a thought for poor  urlLink Winston Bogarde , whose FOUR YEAR Chelsea 'nightmare*' is finally coming to an end.  *Bogarde's definition of nightmare = sitting on your arse collecting 40k a week for doing sod all. CAN NO-ONE STOP THIS EVIL?  ************     Fahrenheit 9/11 won the Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes. And Old Boy won the Grand Prix, which was a big surprise, mainly because I didn't think head of the Cannes jury Quentin Tarantino would allow another revenge flick to overshadow his own. It's an awesome movie though. I like it. I like it a lot.  Speaking of movies, guess who bought Battle Royale 2 on DVD yesterday? Expect a review later. My sis is dying to watch it so I'll be bringing it home for sure.  ************     Review in haiku form:  Cheesy dialogue Bloom is still a soppy cunt but the action rocks  ************  The last episode of Friends is good, but not great. Don't watch it expecting a life-changing experience, and you'll like it just fine. It's been a pretty good last series, bar the Applegate episode and the rushed wrap-up of storylines. Series 9 was better, though.  Coming this Autumn: Joey!      "Emmy nominee Matt LeBlanc reprises his Friends role as charming Joey Tribbiani in this comedy spin-off that continues the beloved Friends tradition. Joey, an aspiring actor, is off to Los Angeles to pursue his dream and begin a new chapter in his life. In this new town he’s sure to face new challenges, both professional and personal. After reuniting with his sister, Gina, Joey moves in with his 20-year-old genius nephew, Michael, who is literally a rocket scientist. What Joey lacks in book smarts, however, he makes up for with people smarts, making him the best new friend his nephew could ask for. Cast: Matt LeBlanc, Drea deMatteo, Paulo Costanzo, Ashley Scott, Jennifer Coolidge."

      Come in today, ready to attack the internet to get stuff I need to apply for my teacher training wage and find a couple of images for a picture idea. Guess what - the internet decides to break. Not in a full "Bollocks. No internet" way - in a "This site works, this site works, Bollocks, this one doesn't". The two sites that have real problems.  *GTTR *Google  Bollocks. Can't find the info I need and can't search for images (before you tell me, Lycos is crap).  All this, and I'm being kicked out of my own bed tonight! This weekend is TFMrs's hen do, so her sister's are coming up. Instead of letting them kip on our floor and the luxurious sofa, she's given them the bed and we are staying at the Wragg-Devlin place (Cheers, Dan and Pops).  Still, a weekend where my entire plan at the moment revolves around beer and a Cup Final, you cannot complain. Especially if I get a load of software to arse around with as well.  =  Three lovely Leeds related stories in the Guardian this morning.  *Kevin Blackwell will be the boss. Not the biggest shock since he's a) cheap and b) erm... that's it. My dad probably will not go to see Leeds next year because he hates Blackwell. He has the kind of inexplicable rage that I had when I learnt Venables was our new boss.  *Everton will fail to sign Smith because, in the words of Peter Lorimer, "His preffered move is to Manchester United". This a week after apparently sticking two fingers up at fans who chanted "Play for the Scum, You can't come back" during the Chelsea game.  *Leeds popular striker, Mark Viduka, is set to make a move that will really set his standing as a Leeds legend - Galatasaray.

      "...I’m not alone in thinking that this movie is the worst idea since Greedo shoots first.. " -  Holden McNeil, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back   As you may know, the original Star Wars Trilogy is released on DVD later this year. However, George Lucas has decided he will not only never release the unaltered version (which I managed to get the last boxset of, apparently. Better stop wearing them out), but the alterations made in 1996 are not enough. he's doing more to include the prequels.  You may remember this cause controversy the first time. New explosions and light sabres looked great, the extended dance at Jabba's place was not. The addition of Greedo's shot to make Han Solo look like he was protecting himself, instead of a guy with dodgy morals, was also dumb. So, we really should be surprised at the new final shot of Return Of The Jedi:     No more bald, fat Anakin. Shame. Don't you think Yoda and Obi Wan will be pissed off, not being allowed to spend eternity as younger versions of themselves?

      I've got most of the stuff I need to sent off which will get me on into secondary schools and, hopefully, get me into St. Paulinus. I also have to apply for YOU, the taxpayer, to pay tuition fees and training wage.  Ringing St. Paulinus was fun, what with an inexplicably bad phone line (having to sneak into the staff car park so no-one at work would hear, the bars kept dropping from "Full Signal" to "Middle Of Cumbria, in a tunnel") and the following conversation, which makes me sound like a blagger.  "So, why do you want to come to our school?" "Well, I've heard good things from someone who, erm.., I think still teaches there" (white lie - I heard through her son) "Oh, who is that?" "Mrs.. er... I think she's still Hinchcliffe..." "Ah, S****?" (some anonimity, I think) "Erm... er... yes"  Still, the school passed the ultimate test - my mother drove past and said she wouldn't mind me there (and it's Catholic, so there's the off chance I'll re-convert).  I've put myself down in "Extra-Curricular Activities", to assist the pupils, for Drama. It'd be cool to be the teacher who helps out with the plays - like Ms. Briscoe, with less eyeliner.  =  Squox is up and running. I checked the stats - 48 visits recorded. I might be wrong, but don't hits get recorded every 10 visitors (Titch, is that right)? I think that's from the pimping I did of it on b3ta. Hopefully I'll have some Dreamweaver and stuff to make it look good by the weekend, though 'looking good' is a subjective thing, considering what Titch does for a living. If you haven't seen it, check  urlLink Ookmedia .  Looking at the stats has already given me some surprises. The top 3 images viewed the most in order - the rhibil, the babytank and the punk baby. The top lemming animation is the Ring one. I have had someone from Huddersfield Uni, EnergyWatch.org.uk and another with a gov.uk view the site. 32% of viewers are from the UK, the same number as people with "Unknown" locations, and 24% are American. People from Hungary, Israel, Poland, Taiwan and Argentina have been on. 1.6% of people who've viewed use Linux.  =  Fahrenheit 9/11 got it's Canne Premiere yesterday and apparently went down well. Who would've though an anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War film would go be popular with Hollywood and the French? Further to his claims of Fredom Of Speech Blocking, he's managed to get distribution rights for all but three countries who showed Bowling For Columbine:  *Taiwan *Hong Kong *Er... United States Of America

      Got a big ol' envelope of stuff yesterday from Leeds University yesterday. Inside were details on term times and stuff, plus a list of books 'it would be recommended you read'. I also have to organise a primary school to spend 2 weeks in (13-24 Sept). After two weeks, I have to write a 1500 word essay on the visit and such - my first assignment (all of which come with one of two grades - Pass or Fail).  So, I have been looking on the maps and in the phone book, until I hit on an idea. Titch's mum still does the odd bit of teaching in Dewsbury and David Wragg's new lady is also a teacher up Staincliffe way! That's a way in. According to Titch, his mum's school has had observers before, so I could probably get in. If not, I'll use my other contacts.  Is it a little dumb that I am scared more of the primary school kids than I am secondary?  =  As some of you know, the early link is for my new website,  urlLink Squox.co.uk , which I will be using to host images, such as photos and b3ta stuff. I might move the blog other there soon. Anyway, the site will not work for a few days, as it takes 2-3 days for all the registration guff to go through.  The squox, as you may remember, is this:     It's kind of become my mascot. I like it because it looks quite fluffy, one of my best shopjobs and has a cool name. B3tan's always seem to like it when I find the time for a shameless repost. I've also started using it to mark my images, to avoid the Great Diego Theft of last month.  I'm also trying my hand at a bit of design/art work to decorate the bedroom or living room. Using a "raster creator" (i'll get the link later), I've created an image spread across several sheets of A4.        This is a test to see how it would look. I intend to use like thick, gray panels instead of paper, as well as use a 5x4 grid, instead of the smaller one shown here.  TFMrs is still not convinced, but I think it'll look quite cool.  =  1330 Update:  Squox.co.uk is up and running. I have added my Lemming animations, a series that went down well on b3ta.  Also, it looks like St Paulinus will take me on. COME ON!

      First off, plane ticket sorted, yo. I put this in a comment, but the chances of A-MOL reading it are slim. I'll be in England 2 days earlier than expected. Haven't told my school yet, (who will no doubt be mightily pissed off), but what are you gonna do. The good news is that I'll have time to get over flying halfway across the world, and I won't ruin A-MOL's wedding pictures with huge bags under my eyes.   ==============================  Bands you don't expect to be big in Asia but are, no. 146: Belle and Sebastian.  ==============================     Titchie's wedding had Scalectrix (is that how you spell it) and Kerplunk? That's the coolest wedding ever! How are you gonna top that, Haigh?  ==============================     So I found a copy of Old Boy on DVD (check out  urlLink the website , it's all in Korean but is really fancy), and damn, if it didn't kick Kill Bill's arse in terms of coolness. The Koreans are fiercely proud of their domestic film industry (Korean flicks account for 80%+ of all box office sales, even after you take into account huge movies like Lord of the Rings and Matrix), and justifiably so. For extra movie-buff bonus points, it's one of the films up for the Palme D'Or at this years Cannes festival (happening right now).  urlLink Go here  for more details. And if anyone's got a region-free DVD player (Korean DVDs are region 3), I'll bring it back home.   Y'all need to start watching more Korean / Japanese movies. Speaking of which, they keep showing clips of BR2 on TV here, it doesn't look half as good as the first.

      Let's look at the England Euro 2004 Squad!   Goalkeepers : David James (Man City), Paul Robinson (Tottenham), Ian Walker (Leicester)  Looks quite weak, doesn't it? Three keepers from bottom five clubs.   Defenders : Gary Neville (Man Utd), Phil Neville (Man Utd), Ashley Cole (Arsenal), Wayne Bridge (Chelsea), Sol Campbell (Arsenal), John Terry (Chelsea), Ledley King (Tottenham), Jamie Carragher (Liverpool).  Injuries and pissing suspensions have weakened this dramatically. Competition for the left back position is good, as is someone to put a bit of pressure on Gary Neville at right back. The centre looks a little weak beyond the first choice two (Sol, Terry).   Midfielders : David Beckham (Real Madrid), Paul Scholes (Man Utd), Nicky Butt (Man Utd), Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Owen Hargreaves (Bayern Munich), Kieron Dyer (Newcastle), Joe Cole (Chelsea)  Looks like a lottery to see who wants to play on the left wing. Dyer? Christ, most Newcastle fans wouldn't pick him after this season's form.   Strikers : Michael Owen (Liverpool), Emile Heskey (Liverpool), Darius Vassell (Aston Villa), Wayne Rooney (Everton).  Ho hum. One striker who's had a good season and that's it. Admittedly, Wayne and Darius save their best stuff for England, but it's not exactly terrifying, is it?   Standby : Jermain Defoe (Tottenham), Richard Wright (Everton), Matthew Upson (Birmingham), Gareth Southgate (Middlesbrough), Scott Parker (Chelsea), Alan Smith (Leeds).   Wow. That shows the lack of depth for midfielders and goalkeepers. Has Wright played this year?  I can't say I'm brimming with confidence at the moment. Roll on June 13th.

      26 days of freedom left! Blimey, that's getting close. With less than a week for people to reply, it's starting to come together, so we could possibly start on the table plans, a task which will require checking by the two mothers and possibly Dan Wragg, Inno and Titch to avoid bad table combinations.  Basically, I think all we have to do is write cheques and buy some ribbon for Jarratt's car.  =  On Saturday, I went paintballing for Dave Benson and Ned's birthdays. Instead of indoor, like Titch's stag do, this was outside, which suited me a lot better, having the ability to see and all. The outfits seemed to be thicker than at Bradford too, so paintball hits seemed to hurt a lot less, though I managed not to get twatted as much as I did last time.  Our group of eight got split into different teams, with a load of 14 year olds and TA members. I ended up on the opposite side as Dave Benson and Dan Wragg again while all the 14 year olds ended up with us due to not wanting to be seperated, which made me nervous (if only for the young ones, we tend to know Danny's liking of GBH to youngsters while paintballing). We started the day with 4 Capture The Flag games, one in a basic area, the other in a woodland with bridges and huts. It was pretty cool, being able to clearly see the area, and I found I'm quite a good shot (as good as you can be with balls that move in the air. I nearly got one cracking shot off, only for it to curl away at the last moment). My ecstacy at finding out I can aim was probably what made me less tolerant of CHEATING WANKERS. Several times, people took clear hits and kept firing. One guy, I managed to hit when he leaned out behind barrels, aiming fo someone else and not seeing me, high on the arm. He flinched, and started firing at me. I shouted "Marshall, Paintcheck!" (which makes them go look), alerting a little shit who I hadn't seen, taking a shot high on the inner thigh (my only real bruise from being hit). Another, I hit clearly in the knee, he screamed, turned and started returning fire! When you scream, it's pretty obvious you've been hit. Twats.  I say I've only got one bruise from being hit - I actually got me worst injury in the first game. Trying to slyly make my way forward, I made a mad run towards a fence. Unfortunately, I caught a tree root and went face first into the ground, crushing my thumb under the gun. One of the young ones saw me, asked if I was okay. I tried to cover by crawling on my elbows, as if I meant the big sprawling dive. My right thumb is now causing me agony - I can hold my left thumb up at more than 90 degress, but my right thumb only gives me 60. There's not much you can do with a thumb injury anyway.  After the four games, we broke for a long lunch break. After, another group who'd played while we ate joined, giving a full group of 56 players. One group included a bunch of chav 16 year olds, who needed to be taught the meaning of the words "Gillete Mach 3", spouting tashes not out of place on Franz Ferdinand drummers (though this group did give me a laugh by pointing to us and saying "They must be the professionals"). The next two games involved capturing two flags from the middle of the tree fort area. At the end of the break, Chris Dickens, Inno and I had come up with our main plan - send a few of the fourteen year-olds into the middle as fast as they could run, grab the flags and come back (small targets, 'resurrection' still on, so if they got shot, they weren't out of the game for long). The minute the game started, ALL of the fourteen year-olds went screaming across the field and got the flags, leading to 15 minutes of defending. Which would have been hell, but I managed a personal triumph - I TOOK OUT DAN AND DAVE! Trying to go up the wing, me and one other guy were lying in wait and peppered them with shots. Bitching. Unfortunately, this tactic failed in the last game due to the base being further away from the flags and the kids being traumatised from the first run.  The last two were Capture The Flag in the "Nam" area - bog, bushes, trees, brambles and a few paths. The first game, Chris, Inno, Rich Benson and myself saw TWO people in the whole 25 minute game. The next game, with Danny swapping teams due to several leaving early, was pretty damned cool. Danny and I first tried sneaking, got involved in a huge fire fight on a path, before retreating into the bushes again and sneaking a bit more. This was well cool, with signalling to other troops you were on their side to avoid being shot and general sneaking. Except towards the end - Danny and I had snuck up close to their base undetected, until we spotted a guy patrolling near us. We took him out with several clear shots. He then started firing aimlessly towards us, resulting in Danny's sense of injustice blowing our cover - "FUCK OFF! YOU'RE DEAD, YOU TWAT!"  All in all, it ruled and I want to go again sometime, maybe with more people we know. By the way - be scared of Dave and Danny's idea of buying paintball guns for games in the Wragg fields.  =  Yesterday, I walked to Roberttown and back to Dewsbury along the Greenway (part of an attempt to move some bulk from the lower body, and put it on the legs and upper body in a good way) to see the family, get Debra a copy of a reading she's doing at the wedding and dropping off DVDs to my heavily pregnant sister (7 weeks away now). I know a lot of people say pregnancy is a wonderous, beautiful thing, but I wonder if these people have ever seen the outline of a baby's foot and leg as it kicks out against it's mother stomach. Ew. I got in trouble for not showing a lot of attention to my mother's wedding outfit (turquoise frock coat, if you wondered) and my dad is still not sure if he's off to Elland Road next year.  =  Speaking of football, Dan, you're wrong about the sending offs:  *Fletcher's first booking, possibly a bit harsh, but he did kick the ball away (either that, or it was an attempted pass and I'm right in my first impressions about him). Once you are booked, it's stupidity if you go for a flying studs-up challenge from behind right in front of the ref. *It's Christiano Ronaldo! The petulant diving bumboy should have been sent off several times. The odds of the first one being a dive were good, and to claim he was playing on when he looks at the linesman and ref before chipping the ball suggests he knew what he was doing. In conclusion - he's a little shit who deserves all the sending offs and 50:50 challenges with Danny Mills that he will recieve in future.  The Leeds game sounded a laugh, what with Barmby being abused and Smithy getting some stick for his comments about possibly joining The Scum in midweek. The one thing I noticed was Olembe starting. Considering most of the loan players got dumped, and he hadn't played for months, I was surprised to see him start. I always felt sorry for him, as he was the best French league loanee by a country mile. The problems really started in his first game, when he played a nice chipped pass over the defence, perfect for the striker to run on to. Unfortunately, that striker was a lazy, fat, overpaid cunt, who balled out Olembe for suggesting he would have to move to get a ball. Our new keeper, Carson, had a decent game as well - one of the saves from Joe Cole looking really great.  =  So, another week ahead. I'm not feeling too motivated, as it's too hot and I can't be arsed, so there may be some new stuff or b3ta pics in the near future.

      ...here's more pointless ramblings and spelling mistakes.    Titchie has a new job! Congratulations, but no more being a kept man for you.  Man U in not-the-worst-team shocker! Anyone else find it funny that Real Madrid also have to go through the Champs League qualifiers after losing to a relegated side and Becks getting sent off? Well, I did. Especially after Man U had 2 players (undeservedly) sent off in their last game.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 is great. As great as Vol. 1? I'm not going to say until I see the unedited version outside of Chorea. But would it really have been so hard to cut the first 20 minutes of Vol. 2, trim a little off the O-Ren story in Vol. 1 and made a kick arse 3 hour movie? No. But remember kids, multi-part movies are where it's at these days.  Many people have said the Premiership this year was the dullest it's ever been, in terms of the predictability to the top and bottom 3. But look who's coming up next season - can anyone really envisage West Brom and Norwich finishing anywhere above 18th place? The only cool thing to happen this year was Bolton not being in a relegation dogfight. Bolton - they're this year's Everton.    I'm off downtown to find the new Ghostface album (which supposedly rules), finally get myt plane tickets sorted out (hopefully, if certain travel agents would actually open during business hours for a change), hunt down a Korean movie that everyone I know raves about ( urlLink Old Boy  - don't bother looking on imdb, it ain't there) and write more sentences that end in parentheses (typing and eating watermelon at the same time is difficult and messy).

      Bring it.  In series order:   113 The One with the Boobies  Chandler accidentally walks in on Rachel after a shower and sees her breasts, leading to a series of shower peepings. Phoebe's new psychiatrist boyfriend, Roger, depresses and angers everyone. Joey finds out his dad has been having an affair with Ronni, a pet mortician, for six years; he insists his dad either break it off or confess, but it turns out his mom already knew--and didn't want it to stop.   You're too harsh on series 1, Mole. There are plenty of great episodes, this being one of them. I do agree that the episode with the bloke from Highlander (TV series) is bollocks, though.  Best line:  Roger: Well, I'm not... I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. Phoebe: You're not? See, that's why you're so great! Roger: Actually it's... it's quite, you know... typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. You know, this kind of co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're all, like, "Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!"      214 The One With The Prom Video      Joey, now earning money, gives Chandler an expensive (and gaudy) gold bracelet. Joey is hurt when he finds out Chandler doesn't like it. Monica has a job interview with a restaurant manager who has a salad fetish. Rachel's starting to date again, which prompts Ross to interfere... until she makes it clear that they are never going to get together. Phoebe shares her "lobster" theory. Jack and Judy Geller come by to drop off some of Monica's things; they're turning her room into a gym. Monica tells them about losing her job, but she just can't get the courage to ask them for money. Amongst Monica's items from home is a video of herself and Rachel preparing for their Senior Prom. Rachel's pre-surgery nose, Monica's large stature, and Ross' "Mr. Kotter" look are featured. In the video, Rachel's date doesn't show up and she's distraught about having to miss her own Prom. Ross prepares to take her, but just before this is revealed, Rachel's date shows up. Rachel, watching the video for the first time, is so moved by Ross' compassion for her that she forgives him for "the list" and kisses him passionately. Monica discovers some unexpected footage of her parents at the end of the video tape.   Come on, the prom video one is the best episode ever. Some episodes make you piss yourself, some make you cry. This does both.  Best line:  Mrs. Geller (on video): Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica? Monica (on video): Over here dad. Mr. Geller (on video): Wait, how do you zoom out? There she is. Joey: Some girl ate Monica! Monica: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds. Chandler: Uh, so how many cameras are actually on you?       217 The One Where Eddie Moves In      Joey shows his friends his new apartment, which (unfortunately) he decorated himself. A record producers signs Phoebe to make a video of Smelly Cat, but dubs in someone else's voice. Monica is annoyed that Ross is around so much; they fight like typical siblings. Chandler and Joey miss each other, but neither one will admit it. Chandler gets a new roommate, Eddie, who seems like a great guy. Joey is jealous, and he and Chandler fight like a typical couple. Chandler finds out that he does really have that much in common with Eddie after all.   I was going to put the one where Eddie won't go, but the other storyline (Be Your Own Windkeeper book) is shite. Eddie is the greatest character of all time though, so deserves inclusion.  Best line:   Joey: Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine? Huh? Chandler: Well, I like both eggs equally. Joey: Oh, come on! Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other, and I wanna know which. Chandler: Well, what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. Did you really expect me to never find new eggs?      509 The One With Ross's Sandwich      Joey lets himself look bad in order to explain away various discoveries that could expose Monica's and Chandler's relationship: underwear in Monica's sofa; a lady's razor in his shower; candlelight and videotape; a nude polaroid. He threatens to tell everyone the truth unless Chandler and Monica can come up with a story that makes him look good. They don't come through, so Joey creates a new lie: he slept with Monica in London and she's been after him ever since. Phoebe takes a literature class; Rachel decides to come with her, but doesn't bother to read the books. After Rachel steals her ideas in the first class, Phoebe feeds Rachel misinformation about the second book. Ross has a problem with rage after someone at work steals his Thanksgiving-leftovers sandwich. After scaring his co-workers, yelling at his boss, and getting upset at a psychiatrist, he gets put on tranquilizers.   The only one I agree with A-MOL on.  Best line:   Joey: Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.       622 The One Where Paul's The Man      Monica, not yet engaged, gets on a two-year waiting list to hold a wedding at a local museum; however, due to a cancellation, the museum calls and offers her a spot sooner, to Chandler's surprise. He freaks out... or so it seems. Paul tells Ross to stop dating Elizabeth; Ross and Elizabeth go away for a secret weekend at her grandmother's cabin, but Paul and Rachel show up there as well. Ross gets away with it, thanks to some emotional blackmail. Joey, back in show businees, tries to get his celebrity picture back on a dry cleaner's wall. Gunther realizes Joey's not working at the coffee house any more.   People talk about the witty one-liners and the will they/won't they Ross and Rachel saga, but the one thing that has kept Friends above the rest of the sitcoms, especially in recent years, has been David Schwimmer's physical comedy. Seriously, there's only 2 or 3 people who are in the same league. This episode is in for one moment, and one moment only; when Ross goes from hiding behind the door to hiding under the bed in Paul's bedroom. Cracks me up every single time.  Best line:   Paul (to himself): Just relax. Just relax, Paul, you're doing great. She likes you. She... maybe, she likes you. She likes you. Youknow why? Because you're a... neat guy. You are the man. You are... The Man! I still got it! Nice and sexy. You're just a love machine. [singing] I'm just a love machine, and I won't work for nobody but you! Hey baby!      719 The One With Ross And Monica's Cousin      Joey is up for a leading role in a movie, but the director is looking for an uncircumcized male to do a nude scene. Joey claims he's not circumcized, and then Monica helps him by making a variety of attachments to choose from. (He chooses Silly Putty.) But the piece falls off during Joey's final audition. Rachel and Phoebe realize they're expected to throw Monica a bridal shower, so they quickly put one together. Ross and Monica's cousin Cassie comes to visit for a few days. She's so drop-dead gorgeous that Chandler can't stop staring; Ross makes a move on her; and Phoebe considers her options as well.   How can you not love an episode with a fake foreskin and references to incest? Makes the top 6 despite the somewhat dull bridal shower story.   Best line:  Ross: I'll always remember that summer because that was when I realsied you and I are related. Cassie: It took you that long to realise? Ross: Yeah, I'm a little slow. (to himself) Just as our children would be.     906 The One With The Male Nanny      Monica's excitement about her new place of work doesn't really phase Chandler, until she mentions that one of her co-workers (Jeffery) is the funniest guy she's ever met. Chandler tries to prove he's funnier. Phoebe and Mike take the next step in their relationship, by exchanging apartment keys. Then Phoebe's old flame, David (The Scientist Guy), comes to town from Minsk for a few days, putting Phoebe's emotions in conflict. Rachel and Ross hire a male nanny (Sandy) to care for Emma, but he's too sensitive for Ross's comfort. Joey learns life lessons from the nanny's puppet shows.   I told A-Mol that I thought Gary Oldman was the best guest star in Friends, but Freddie Prinze Jr comes a damn close second. And Chandler questioning how funny he is is really great too.  Best line:   Sandy [as unnamed puppet]: And what's the one kind of boat they can never, ever sink? Joey [as Mr. Wigglemunch]: What kind? Sandy [as puppet]: A Friendship. Joey: Wow, you blow my mind. Sandy: Oh, I gotta go. Joey: Oh, how much do I owe ya? Sandy: Twenty bucks. Joey: It's like the cheapest college ever!

      Sorry, couple of days with no new stuff. Will remedy immediately.  Anyone else who uses Blogger (i.e. Dan) - ain't the new design for the posting pretty?  So, the last weekend saw a few things happen:  *Leeds relegation confirmed, dropping to the bottom on the league. Still, great game and great party atmosphere. *We went to Brinham Rocks, so TFMrs can now shut up about them. We went with The Hinchcliffes, and I may post a couple of pics - soon! *Chinese meal with Dan Wragg, Pops, Chris and Ness.  It also looks like we have two stag does organised. Karting at Batley on the 29th May for mine, a weekend to Bruges for Wragg's 9th July (Dan, I'm meant to check when you are coming back from Chorea)  =  Oh,  urlLink guess who who got FP'd again, bitches!

      2 out of 3 - God, that's depressing.  Well, with Friends ending yesterday in the US and over here on the 28th of May, T4 are running a competition. Usually, I pay no attention to these ("Who won Pop Idol? A. Will Young, B. Will Hague, C. Will Shakespeare") but this one got me thinking, because it's right out of High Fidelity.  Name your Top 6 Friends Episodes.  Ouch.  So, after a week of ruminating and congugating, here are the six episodes that I feel are my favourite. Feel free to insult my choices and pick your own in the comments box below.   Season 1 - TOW The Blackout  The first episode where, for me, Friends changed from "another US sitcom" to a great comedic series. A blackout causes Chandler to end up stuck in a bank vestibule, or atrium, with a model. Ross acts on Joey's advice to ask Rachel out, resulting in him being attacked by a cat, which causes more problems when the cat's owner shows up.  There are so many great lines in this, with Chandler trying to find ways to look cool and not creepy, as well as Ross's worrying about Rachel (for the record, I liked Season 1 Ross but didn't like him so much in the whole R&R thing, not recovering until his breakdown in Series 5).   Favourite Lines:  Chandler: 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said, 'gum would be nice,' or, 'I'll have a stick,' but no-no-no-no-no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.  =   Season 3 - TOW The Football  It's Thanksgiving. A friendly game of touch football takes a nasty turn as Chandler and Joey argue over a Dutch girl and Rachel wants to prove herself at sports. The atmosphere grows tenser as the ultimate prize is unveiled - The Gellar Cup.  A great episode that shows the bizarre relationship between Ross and Monica and Joey starts his decent from moron into uber-moron.   Favourite Lines:  Chandler: Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?  =   Season 4 - TOW The Embryos  Phoebe has her brother's embryos implanted. However, this becomes secondary as a bet is made between Chandler and Joey against Monica and Rachel over who knows each other best. The stakes - ownership of Monica and Rachel's apartment and the chick and the duck. The quizmaster - Ross.  I don't feel the need to explain this one too much - it's the quiz one. It rules.   Favourite Lines  Ross: Correct! What is Chandler Bing's job? Rachel: Oh! Oh gosh, it has something to do with numbers. Monica: And processing! Rachel: Oh, well... and he carries a briefcase! Ross: Ten seconds. You need this or you lose the game. Monica: It's, um, it has something to do with transponding. Rachel: Oh, oh, oh, he's a transpons... transponster! Monica: That's not even a word!  =   Season 5 - TOW Ross's Sandwich  Ross's decent into madness continues when someone steals his sandwich and he turns to Phoebe for advice. Joey has to explain items that Chandler leaves behind so not to reveal Chandler's relationship with Monica, leading Phoebe and Rachel to believe he is a pervert. Phoebe and Rachel take a literature course.  Ross going nuts is just downright funny and this is the best example, Joey taking the blame is great and Phoebe setting up Rachel makes what could have been a weak "Give them something to do" story a real asset to the episode ("It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.")   Favourite Lines:  Ross: Really? So... so what would you say, Pheebs? Stuff like, uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?" Chandler: Say, Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?  =   Season 5 - TOW Everyone Finds Out  Rachel and Phoebe discover Chandler and Monica's secret, so Phoebe is sent on a mission to seduce Chandler to expose the affair. This results in Chandler being sent on a counter-mission by Monica to throw them off the scent. In the end everyone finds out, except Ross who has just bought the apartment across the street from Monica...  This episode, like TOW The Embryos, is great down to one real thread - Phoebe and Chandler's game of Seduction 'Chicken' ("So, this is my bra"). Plus, Ross goes nuts at the end.   Favourite Lines:  Phoebe: They thought they could mess with us! They're trying to mess with us? They don't know that we know they know we know! And Joey, you can't say anything! Joey: I couldn't if I wanted too.  =   Season 8 - TOW The Videotape  The fallout of Rachel's pregnancy leads to an argument about who seduced whom. Luckily, Ross taped the night. Chandler and Monica are worried that a couple they met on honeymoon may be giving them the brush-off.  What I like about this one is how a load of seamingling meaningless comments ("Hi, Ken Adams. Nice to meet you") and the two main stories come together for a great denouement. A funny episode due to the sheer embarrassment of both Rachel and Ross.   Favourite Lines:  Ross:Do you have a minute? I'd like to talk with you about something I'm really uncomfortable talking about. Joey:Sure. How about, uh, you showering with your mom? Ross:I actually had a topic in mind.

      I was going to write a long piece on how crap Man U have become, but I couldn't be arsed. Instead, enjoy this completely unrelated, but still piss funny, picture, taken during the heyday of the Ferguson era.     Is she coming to the wedding?  For a bonus bit of nostalgia, check out the filename.  Old photos rule. Especially when they're not of you.

       urlLink Michael Moore's new documentary blocked by Disney.       Oscar-winning film-maker Michael Moore's latest documentary may be in cold storage following a reported row between its distributor, Miramax, and parent company Disney.  According to the industry newspaper Variety, the Walt Disney Company has moved to prevent the company run by the Weinstein brothers from releasing Fahrenheit 911, which links US president George Bush to Osama bin Laden and members of other powerful Saudi business families.  The follow-up to the anti-gun film Bowling for Columbine is still set to premiere at the Cannes film festival later this month, but does not currently appear on Miramax's summer schedule. There had been suggestions of a July release.  If true, Disney's move to block the new film's release would not be the first time Moore has been censored. In 2001, the release of the comedian and satirist's book Stupid White Men was blocked by publisher HarperCollins, who threatened to pulp printed copies, arguing that the book's attack on the US government was inappropriate in the months after September 11. Following a campaign by Moore, the book was eventually published and went on to top the New York Times bestseller list.  A Miramax spokesman told Variety the company was "looking forward to resolving this amicably". Disney itself was unavailable for comment, said the paper.  Fahrenheit 911 was originally the subject line of a February 2002 email from Moore to supporters accusing HarperCollins of failing to publish Stupid White Men because of its criticism of Mr Bush.  Moore has been relentless in his criticism of the government and used his Oscar acceptance speech in 2003 to further condemn the administration, calling Mr Bush "a fictitious president".   No matter on your politics or your opinion of Michael Moore, this seems a stupid move of Disney's part because they are going to end up looking like the 'bad guys' in the end. Any moves to block the film will see protests similar to the one HarperCollins experienced.  You'd have to say the move looks good for Bush.  Bowling For Columbine  was a big success that got everyone talking, and it would not help GWB's re-election to have some of his families dubious connections mentioned (another one for your interest - there appears to be evidence that Prescott Bush, George Snr's father, made a lot of money dealing with the Nazi's in WWII). However, this block will give the film even more publicity so could actually bring this stuff into sharper focus.   From his  urlLink website:    Friends,  I would have hoped by now that I would be able to put my work out to the public without having to experience the profound censorship obstacles I often seem to encounter.  Yesterday I was told that Disney, the studio that owns Miramax, has officially decided to prohibit our producer, Miramax, from distributing my new film, "Fahrenheit 9/11." The reason? According to today's (May 5) New York Times, it might "endanger" millions of dollars of tax breaks Disney receives from the state of Florida because the film will "anger" the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. The story is on page one of the Times and you can read it here (Disney Forbidding Distribution of Film That Criticizes Bush).  The whole story behind this (and other attempts) to kill our movie will be told in more detail as the days and weeks go on. For nearly a year, this struggle has been a lesson in just how difficult it is in this country to create a piece of art that might upset those in charge (well, OK, sorry -- it WILL upset them...big time. Did I mention it's a comedy?). All I can say is, thank God for Harvey Weinstein and Miramax who have stood by me during the entire production of this movie.  There is much more to tell, but right now I am in the lab working on the print to take to the Cannes Film Festival next week (we have been chosen as one of the 18 films in competition). I will tell you this: Some people may be afraid of this movie because of what it will show. But there's nothing they can do about it now because it's done, it's awesome, and if I have anything to say about it, you'll see it this summer -- because, after all, it is a free country.  Yours,  Michael Moore

      Well, what a start to the week in terms of news. Of course the two dominating stories are:  *Stupid soldiers and their Kodak moments * urlLink Leslie Grantham wanking on webcam in the Eastenders' dressing room   What has to be said about the soldiers is this - even if they are not fake, the Brits showed a lot more sense then their Yankee counterparts by NOT SHOWING THEIR FACES!  Unbelievably, the family of the silly bint in the US pictures have been trying to defend her, including this quote on ITN this morning, which had me choking on my Weetabix:  "They were only following orders"  a) Bullshit b) This sounds oddly familiar, doesn't it? "Arbeit Macht Frei"  And, of course, Dirty Den. He's now facing more allegations from a woman who claims he did similar while wearing a Peter Pan costume (in his Panto dressing room) and described his fantasies with animals. With this, and allegations that he insulted several cast members in the online chat (How did that go?"What RU wearing?", "Nothing? What U think of Babs Windsor and Jesse Wallace?"), methinks he might have another appointment with a daffodil wielding assassin.  =  On a more savoury note,  there is continuing evidence of my bad influence on the future Mrs. To recap our tale, innocent farmgirl meets drunken, foul-mouthed, workshy twat (seriously, on the 'drunken' thing, it's horrible to think how much I used to drink, particulary around the ages 17-20. I think my 21st birthday rid me of some of my excesses). Now, TFMrs can hold her own in a sweary argument, so much so that when washing up and cooking needs to be done, it seems like Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.  A few weeks back, you may have remembered me mentioning I'd bought Splinter Cell. As part of that purchase, I bought Civilization III for her, as she's played Civ II to death. However, Virgin hadn't removed a security device from the box, so it was impossible to get the CD out. I was going to return it, but stuff like work, f**tball and wedding arranging got in the way. So, last week, we attacked the box with a penknife, a screwdriver and sheer bloodymindedness and got it out (i.e. If you steal stuff from Virgin, it's easy to get past the security features).  So, both of us have had goes (I've started because I'm at a part on Splinter Cell I can't get past. Unarmed and having to sneak, I have all the grace in the computer world I do in the real world) and it's great. Unfortunately, it has that problem all new strategy games have when first played - the multi-hour playing session. For some reason, you just can't get up to pee until you're sure the Cathedral is built, you can't eat until you've amassed enough forces outside Paris to start an effective seige and you can't save and go to bed until you have the ability to build cannons.  Monday night, when we both have work in the morning, TFMrs is playing late. Remember, she never used to play games more advanced than Minesweeper. I go to bed, read a bit, and fall asleep. Next thing I know, I'm roused from my sleep by her coming to bed. I turn and ask the time.  2 AM!  Considering that anyone who knows her will tell you she cannot function on less than 10 hours sleep, that is the equivalent of a Championship manager all-nighter for her! To try and stop her doing this again, I refused to let her on the machine until she'd done her washing up and cooked a meal (both her turn. I'm not that evil). She didn't get on in the end - my campaign against the Chinese went on longer than I thought.

      "We're going down in a minute, Down in a minute..." Leeds fans, 89 minutes into the Bolton game     After the false hopes they kept throwing up to make us believe the inevitable could be stopped, we drop thanks to a capitulation and a stupid Australian twat. You couldn't fault the Leeds fans, who made me laugh with most of the songs they were coming out with (The early-in-the-game "We're shit, but we're beating you", "Down With The Bradford, We're Going Down....")  Admittedly, it's not over. If we can get six points and 37+ goals more than Man City in the next two games against Charlton and Chelsea, we'll stay up.  So, just as a last mention on the season, here's  A-MOL's List Of People Who Should Be Swinging By A Noose From The Revie Stand    Peter Ridsdale/Allan Leighton/ The Board  "We were living the dream" - the excuse that Honest Pete likes to bring out every so often. They took a risk, they say, that the money spent could bring us glory. So, they basically committed the same act as the guy who sold everything he owned to put it on a single red/black bet on a roulette table for Sky One.   "Everyone encouraged us to spend the money" - however, this doesn't work when you are not being honest with the fans about the financial dealings at the club. Guess who is meant to give fans a reality check about spending stupid amounts on Seth Johnson and Michael Duberry - THE BOARD  But, as well as putting the club in a dodgy position, when it started to go wrong (as wrong as finishing 5th in the League and the QF's of the UEFA Cup can be), they panicked and did the stupidest thing possible - replaced David O'Leary with...   Terry Venables  A guy who's sole achievements include winning the league with a Barcelona side Titch could have coached to success, an FA Cup with Spurs and the SF of Euro 96 (at home, drawing with Switzerland and scraping past a piss-poor Spanish team) and recent history amounted to failing to beat Saudi Arabia with a talented Australian side (some of whom will be mentioned later) and bankrupting Crystal Palace.  First point of order - spending the few transfer funds we had on Nicky Barmby and the worst player in Leeds history (I include Roque Jnr, who could pass a bit, and Tomas "6 goals" Brolin), Paul Okon. It would surprise no one that he tried to buy Darren Anderton and Stan Lazaridis to do the old El Tel trick - surround him with players and staff who will tell him how great he is.  You had to admire the bare cheek of a man who excused bad results in December as "the settling-in period". He couldn't believe his luck when the sale of Woodgate went through due to our financial situation as it gave him a brand new excuse to use until his sorry arse was kicked out of the club, with £2M owed to him.   Brian Kidd  Not everything O'Leary did was great. This was his biggest mistake, but you could hardly blame him if you read the papers. Kidd is apparently the greatest coach England has produced, though his success after leaving Old Trafford was minimal.   His first task - change the system that took Leeds to a Champion's League Semi Final (fast, strong, relentless attacks, based on Bowyer, Kewell, Smith and Keane or Bridges speed, backed with the strength of Viduka, Dacourt, Batty, Woodgate) and use a new tactic. Out went exciting, fast-flowing football, in came passing the ball constantly and slowing down play. Which played to the strengths of, erm... no one.  With the original system gone, O'Leary gone so unable to change it and Venables ready to back up the Kidd myth, we stuck with it.   Mark Viduka  Fuck it, I'm saying it. Yes, he may have kept us up last year with an incredible run of goals at the end of the season. Yes, he's scored some great goals for us this year. Yes, he is potentially one of the best strikers in the league.  But, HE IS A STUPID, LAZY, FAT CUNT. You'd think you could motivate yourself every week for £65K a week (some of which is IMAGE RIGHTS. Players like Beckham, Ronaldo, Totti, Del Piero, Henry - fine. Viduka?), but nope, consistently we got Lazy mark, who couldn't run 5 yards for a ball, preferring to turn and bollock the guy passing to him for not hitting it straight to him.  And what the fuck was he doing, in the most important game of Leeds' recent history, committing two petulant acts in front of the referee, 1 min and 24 seconds apart? The complete anti-thesis of Alan Smith.  So, we're left to play the giants of Plymouth and Crewe (I respect both teams, because they are small but well run, but still...). My father is so depressed about the state of the team he's followed 40+ years that he's unsure whether to renew, as am I, but for other reasons (the whole student thing).  I'll tell you one thing I won't be doing - buying a new shirt.

      Just found this on a friend's blog (also in Korea):   "You see, it was just the other day that I found out that my girlfriend of one month has had another boyfriend for the past year.  If me being emotional is unjustified now, then when is it ever?  "   What's wrong with these people? I'm getting Kim Jong-Il on the phone after work and telling him to send his nukes down here ASAP.

      Again. Just thought I'd write this to pre-empt A-MOL's relegation tirade of abuse.   First of all, I've mentioned this before, but how shit is it that while Huddersfield are busy throwing away their chances of automatic promotion, their former striker is knocking 'em in for fun at the top level, including the winning goal vs. Man U at the weekend?  Second of all, went to the record shop downtown the other day. The bloke who runs it is always really nice to me and gives me discounts and stuff, possibly because I'm the only person in Korea who still buys albums instead of downloading them. Anyway, there wasn't much that appealed to me but I have an uncontrollable urge to buy something when I'm in a music shop, so I picked up the new D12 album. The first D12 album was very hit-and-miss, but there were some great songs on it (Fight Music, Purple Pills), plus the new video is great.     So I get home, put it on and....  (worst nightmare scenario)  IT'S THE F*****G EDITED VERSION!!!!!  Now, 90% of rap music, I can live with listening to the edited version. But it's a huge problem with a band like D12, which has precisely 1 member with any lyrical talent, half a dozen mediocre rappers, and one fat guy whose idea of rapping is swearing and spewing out filth that makes Bret Easton-Ellis look like Enid Blyton. So, (and trust me, I'm not exaggerating on this), when we get to Bizarre's verse on song 2, we hear somethng like this:  "I'm _______  like _____, then I'll____ ___ ______ ______ _____. Come all over your ____ _____ ____ like you was ____ _____ ____.  ____ ___ _____ so ___ __ ____ ____ mother ________ ______, you don't know how many ______ I be _____ ___ ___ ________ till you ___ __ ____."  And you know those 'clean' versions of songs that Eminem does? Well, he only does that for his singles. So out of 20 tracks, there are only a couple that don't read like a Rebecca Loos text message transcript. Track 13 is simply entitled *****.  So, aside from the joy of listening to hacked-up mediocre rap over average beats, I have two further problems with this. First of all, there was no sticker on the CD saying "Edited Version". Nothing. Not even a mention in the small print in the liner notes. Second, this is the official Korean release of the album. Now, I've bought other rap albums in Korea before (Black Eyed Peas, Outkast, N*E*R*D), and none of them were edited. So why now? Why can I watch Goodfellas at 10am on a Saturday morning in all it's ball-busting glory, but I can't hear the word "bitch" on a CD? The whole thing pisses me off no end. More than I already was.

      Before I start -  urlLink a pretty good rexamination of The Matrix Reloaded . Will Helm is pretty great, and it's worth checking out the archives at the bottom for his stuff on other shitty films.  I had a thought last night, so bare with me. It's about David Beckham.  The poor fella has had a rough time, what with his (alleged) affair with his PA, his shitty second half of a season at Real Madrid, his lazy performances for England and his inability to hit an 8 foot by 8 yard target from 12 yards away.   Yesterday, someone decided to take his frustration with Beckham's Euro 2004 half-assing by vandalising a  urlLink photo of him  (£7,500 for a photo? What is it - his wedding?). "Beckham and Meier, you loosers" was daubed on in red ink.  To quote the Beeb -  "The misspelling of 'losers' may have been a reference to Rebecca Loos, whose claims of an affair with Beckham made headlines earlier this year" . You see, my thinking, mainly because he's still blaming the ref for doing his job, is that the extra 'o' is due to the guy being thick as fuck.  Beckham has blamed his performance on Real's training methods. There is a possible case, due to the general shitiness of Zidane, Raul and other Real players (though Raul Bravo's bad form is thought to be down to him being crapper than Ian Harte). Rather brilliantly, Beckham has fucked off his bosses with this claim, which can't help when they already want to offload (and Chelsea no longer interested. Ooops! Odds on the usual 'star player has shit year for one of the Milan clubs' story?). The president, Perez, came out with the following:   We understand your concerns, David. We agree with you that your training was not up to it. But who did not train at all during the Christmas break? Who keeps flying back to England when asked to rest?"    Why am I bringing this up?  France v England, 13th June 2004. Sitting in front of Danny Wragg's TV.  "Is it me, or does Beckham look a bit tubbier than usual?"  This observation, made in the anthem, was laughed down ("Yeah, he's a right fat bastard!"), being a bit of my patented Beckham hatred (I hated him before it was cool - Youth Cup Final 1994. Little twat stays on wing, flicks his hair, moans, does fuck all, acts like a big star, finishes on lo'o'sing side [see what I did there]). However, it may have to be said that I was right! Dave and his club think he's unfit, so he odds are that he's put on a bit of extra layering.  So, to Danny Wragg, Charlotte Wragg, Little Bob, Chris Dickens and Vanessa:   "Ha ha! Fuck off!"   Meant in the nicest possible way of course :o)

      Cheers to Titch for  urlLink this link,  explaining the next step in online gaming.   Sociolotron, currently in beta, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game. The game offers fare such as battling monsters, questing and other fantasies familiar to players of games like EverQuest and Ultima Online. But Sociolotron differs by providing a way to indulge in sexual taboos like rape and bondage with consequences like sexually transmitted diseases and even pregnancy. And it is quite explicit in informing would-be players about what they may experience in-world.  To Patric Lagny, Sociolotron's developer, the game is about breaking down the social conventions that limit what players can do in the EverQuests of the world.  "I see it as an environment where you should be able to do anything you want," he said. "It goes beyond the real and gives people the opportunity to do things you couldn't in reality."  According to Lagny, rapes -- as with other in-game crimes like theft, murder and the like -- are quickly investigated. If the perpetrator is caught, he or she is sent to trial. There, a prosecutor, judge and jury -- all roles filled by players -- preside as the accused argues his or her case. Penalties for rape range from a week to two weeks in the game's jail, said Lagny.  "It looks like they're saying, why don't we take the mechanisms of society as they exist, which already have checks and balances built in," said Dibbell, "and just map them into the game play."  "I think sexual crimes are interesting," he said, "because unlike killing or (other) physical violence, there is a real psychological element of degradation and humiliation."  And the reactions of those who have been raped in Sociolotron is revealing, especially given that they knew ahead of time that it could happen to them.  "While being raped, it's a loss of control," said a female Sociolotron player known as Phoenix. I "have (only) been raped once by an unknown rapist, (and it) scared the daylights out of me at first."  "I spent about an hour talking to a male victim of a male rapist in the game," said a player known as Ginger, "and he was actually quite distressed about it all in a real-life way."  Even the rapists themselves sometimes have the tables turned on them, said Lord Foucault.  "Being raped myself was shocking at first," he said. "When it happened on a public street where anyone could see it, I was shocked."  Surprisingly, however, some players find that, even though they identify with the emotions their characters feel, they don't always think being raped in the game is all that awful, especially after the first time. And that has every bit to do with the fact that they know they are participating in a world where, as Lagny says, players are encouraged to act as they wish.  "We get very emotional about what happens to our characters, as we do put a lot of work into them," said Phoenix. "But we also need to remember (that) when we signed up for the game that we were all warned about what can and will happen in the game. And we have to figure out how our characters will deal with the 'emotional damage.'"  For Lord Foucault, that meant deciding that what had happened to him was "cool" and then figuring out ways to make sure it didn't happen again.  In fact, Reynolds said, the fact that rape and other so-called bad acts are possible in a game like Sociolotron can actually be a valuable social experiment.  "On the face of it, it looks immoral," he said. "But there are all kinds of reasons, from notions of what games are and what imagination and playing with concepts are, and the fact that, assuming that everyone there is an adult and knows what they're doing, it's not that easy to mount a moral argument against it."  More to the point, said Ginger, Sociolotron's world is one where caveat emptor is the ruling philosophy, and adults who consent to participate in such a world should be left to their own devices.  "If you can't handle virtual bad things happening to you in a virtual world, then you really shouldn't be playing," Ginger said. "This place has been created to get away from the mainstream, to give players a dark environment with which to play in. If they don't want a dark environment where bad things happen, then they should go back to (The Sims Online) or wherever else it was they came from."   Well, ain't that lovely. The only thing I thought you had to worry about in MMORPGs was being h4X0red to annoying Korean kids.  Don't know how true this is - it reads a little like a Brass Eye/"Panto The Dog" style report.

      Spent the weekend with the in-laws. This was mainly to pick up gifts that we’d left down with them and to pick up the 100% Official Wedding Photos. There are some decent ones in there, which I’ll post when I’ve scanned them.  However, the whole picking up thing pissed me off. We set off down to Spalding at 7.30pm Friday night so we could arrange to meet the photographer on the Saturday, which meant I couldn’t watch France vs. Greece and had to rely on Radio 5 for the first half. We get to about Newark and I loose all Radio 5 signal due to the shitty radio, and I’m reduced to relying on text messages from my uncle. After he called when Charisteas put the ball in the net, I made a mad try on the radio and got Talksport (Two Cabbies Shouting – Football365) for the last half an hour. It then turns out that we have to meet him at 7.00pm on the Saturday – so no need to rush down on the Friday, and I could have revelled in the underdog victory. Arses.  =  Generally, that’s my weekend. We had Dan and Barney around last night for the football, which proved we have the Least Baby Safe Flat In The World, which is good to know in case someone has a child soon (6 days and counting…). And, having watched Boogie Nights, I want good Mark Wahlberg back, because he’s ace, and not Crappy Marky Mark, who does shitty remakes.  =  Just got this e-mail:   With reference to our discussions on Friday it would be appear that you were going to resign with 1 months notice from mid july. It would be appreciated if you would tend your offer of resignation at the end of this month but state a slightly longer period of notice (say 6 wks).    Arse. That gives me, even if I manage to stretch it a bit, the 13th of August. Which would mean a month without any paid work. Hopefully, I can cash in my pension and/or share options (Note: go see financial officer this week and find out how the share options work when I'm quitting) and that'd get me through.

      B3ta Challenge this week - Cowboys.  I spent quite a while on this, think it looks pretty damned sweet, and it got a measly two replies!     Still, I guess they had to spend the day moaning and coming up with ways to hack the Swiss ref's website like their a bunch of Italian's. Twats.  =  Old jokes always come back into fashion eventually...  Victoria Beckham broke the World Gangbang Record yesterday.  Her shaved twat fucked a whole country.   (BTW - rumours starting that a story was sat on by the News Of The World, so as not to appear unpatriotic. However, since the subject of the story is no longer involved in any competition, and isn't exactly popular at the minute...)

      Well, it's looking like I have to go through with it now - work know that I'm quitting in the near future.  I had a annual review meeting. 10 minutes in, and knowing a loooong discussion about the projects for the next year was coing up, I just stopped the bullshitting and told them. So, they are expecting my notice in about 2 weeks or so.  The best thing - we are a high-tech company, and generally, with people like programmers and engineers who have access to projects and stuff, they don't want you to have the ability to twat about with the work if your leaving (especially if they have sacked you. No good having a fucked off programmer playing with the source code). My boss made the comment of "tying up loose ends in the next couple of weeks", which may mean I may be on 'gardening leave' for my notice period.  I so fucking hope so!  Meanwhile, the company goes from "strength" to "strength". The Hemel Hempstead facility, i.e. the bane of my working life, is to be shut, meaning about 25-30 people are jobless in two months, and they are now negotiating to get important staff to relocate up here. Good luck. This means my workload would have increased, trying to backward engineer the Hemel products so that we knew how they work.  So, here we are. It looks like my first proper job is coming to an end after 3 years and 6 months. It seems wierd to think of all the changes that were going to happen which I knew were coming, but are now actually happening.  *Marriage *Unclehood *Becoming a student *Relegation (BTW: Michael Ricketts? Could work)

      No excuses. We were just fucking awful.    Whoever thinks Eriksson is tactically astute needs to take a good look at Big Phil Scolari. It's only the most ignorant, naivest of arseholes who thinks "Blimey! 1-0 up with 3 minutes gone! Tell you what, let's sit on this lead for 87 minutes and create fuck all scoring chances". Scolari had England by the bollocks the whole game, and it's no coincidence that 3 times in this tournament he's brought subs on who have turned the game around.  Nice one, Becks, a shocking performance, and that's three out of three penalties you've missed for England. You even managed to upstage Figo's rugby-kicking.  Anyone notice that little ginger bloke running around like a lost child? Neither did I, until he was replaced by Phil Neville.  Campbell will find it hard to forgive himself for having a solid game, then losing out in the air to a little guy who can't even get in the Spurs side.   Grrrr. Even better, I got to go straight to work after the game finished. Nice one.

The attendants    Dan tells his joke about the Korean, the pet shop and the barbeque. I find it offensive while my new wife doesn't get it.    "What's that on my hand?"    "Look! It's still there!"    "Heh. I just shook hands with the photographer and now he's got it."    The parents    "That fucking dwarf is back"    Me and my grandma    I'm really fucked off I forgot to wear my jacket for the cake photos.    And last, but not least, a great big group shoot of everyone, including Dan Wragg, who lost his spine earlier in the day and had to be tied to a board to stand up.

      In our hotel in Corfu, The Mrs. and I had a TV. One of the available channels was, bizarrely, German MTV. An advantage of German MTV is this – no censorship in the middle of the day. The downside – the same fucking songs, constantly. Oh, and a German boyband called O-Zone, who make me wish 911 had never split.  Two songs, which were overplayed to death, are two which have been overplayed to death here - Eamon’s “Fuck It (I Don’t Want You Back)” and his apparent ex-girlfriend, Frankee’s, reply “Fuck You Right Back”. Both successful, but I have pretty much managed to avoid them over here, and missed their full glory. Only now can I appreciate these masterpieces.  Eamon’s original is a song in a “doo-wop” style, mainly standing out because he says the words “fuck” and “ho” a lot. Otherwise, this song would disappear straight away as another moaning twat going on about his cheating ex.  First thing that has to be said – Eamon is an odd looking fucker.     I know I have to be careful, making these claims when there is going to be a lot of pics of me up in the near future, but I thinking Eamon, in the grand scheme of things – not the best catch for the young woman out there.  Basically, Eamon’s lass cheated on him and he’s a bit unhappy. In fact – there is only one line suggesting this (“Ya played me, ya even gave him head”), the rest of the song, just calling her a “ho” and a “bitch”. That’s it. How fucking boring.  For a guy who styles himself as a hard bloke, he does moan like a pissy bitch, doesn’t he. At least Eminem threatens his ex-wife with decapitation. This song is little more than a jazzed up hissy fit.  After the success of this aural tantrum, Frankee, the supposed ex of Eamon releases a reply – to the same fucking boring ass tune.      However, there is still hope that she will put the little twat in his place.  First line: “See I don't know why you cryin' like a bitch”  YES! YOU GO GIRL!  Here comes the chorus… “What I did was your fault somehow”  Frankee! No! You’ve reduced yourself to the level of girls who go on Trisha and say “Well, I had to sleep with your brother, best friend, father and boss because you were never around to give me love” while the blokes been busy with two jobs, earning money to keep them in New Look vest tops and combat pants (combined with stilettos for a really classy look). What the hell is that? “Your fault somehow”. So you have no excuse for cheating on the boring arse, slightly effeminate tosspot? Dear me. I haven’t felt so betrayed since Geri swapped Girl Power for botox and vitamin injections.  So after careful consideration, the two songs dominating the charts are fucking awful tripe. And yet – you can’t go anywhere in Europe without being exposed to this crap. Once the novelty of a sub-Mariah Carey tune with a bit of swearing has worn off, there is nothing to this songs. Hopefully, this is there 15 minutes of fame (Frankee possibly getting another 2 minutes with a Hustler photoshoot) and we never have to hear from them again.  =  Quick thing from the Leeds Utd website and their profile for new striker, Julian Joachim:   "Was called up to play for St Vincent recently only to be told during his flight that he was not eligible to play for them after all!  Hopes of a return to the England fold are not too far away...."    Because if I wanted to return to the England squad, there's only one club I'd join this summer...

      My Wedding Report  By Usher Raymond     "What up, homies. It's me, Usher, bringing you all the dirt from my man A-MOL's wedding day (but not wedding night, I'm saving that shit for my next album). Now, you may be askin', what was a world-famous R'n'B icon such as myself doing at the wedding of a soon-to-be tax dodger? Well, I'll tell y'all.   "There I was, "chillin" one sunny day in my Bevelry Hills "crib", sipping some "crystal" with my "peeps", when I got a phone call. It was that Kelly Rowland, calling for about the 300th time that week, begging me to do a duet with her. She was like "Usher, you gotta help me. I'm third on the bill behind Busted and that tramp from S Club on next week's CDUK". I was like, "Damn, bitch! Take a look at yourself! Did Aretha Franklin ever work with Andrew Ridgely? Hell no!". Anyway, that's when all this stalkin' shit started and I needed to haul ass outta there. So I chose the sleepiest, quietest place I could find. A place where a brother can't even catch a train on Sundays, cuz there ain't none runnin'. I'm talkin' bout Spalding.  "Long story short, I was chillin' in Spalding when I kept hearing this "Usher" talk, which led me here:     "There's the best man. I heard he's so devoted to his woman, he didn't even set foot in the lap dancing club on A-MOL's stag night, let alone complain that his "knee" smelt of "minge". Now that's exactly the kind of devotion I'm singing about in my new single, available in all good Woolworth's, priced 2.99. Buy it, homies, unless you want to see me singing for food stamps with Jennifer Elliston in 3 month's time.     "Notice my main man's evil grin in this picture. First I thought it was just the sun in his face, but then I found he'd stolen all the "blunts" and "forties" from out the back of my "ride", then given them to his friends, as this next picture proves.     "That's some messed-up shit, fo' real.     "Didn't mean to upstage the bride and groom, but what can I say, I love being the centre of attention. Jarratt got pissed off with me because I scratched his "ride" with my "rocks", but I just reminded him of the time he almost ruined my career. You know the Coke ad when I walk on the bus singing about Coke in my award-winning voice that makes "bitches" go wild? Well, Jarratt suggested that instead of that, I should just lean against a radiator in a school cafeteria, wearing a big daft jumper and complaining about girls. Crazy fool, as my brother Mr T. might say.     "So, at the reception they had me perform a short set, so I sang "You Make Me Wanna", which as you all know was my international breakthrough hit, and "Yeah!", which is one of this year's biggest songs. Worldwide. But, wouldn't ya know, these small town folk can't handle it when I enter the "erection section". Just look at Dave Benson, the randy bastard. He's making Dan Wragg look all embarrassed. So, I stopped after 2 songs, and they put some drunken Irish shit on instead.  "Right, I'm off to meet Method Man and Lil' Kim for a swift pint of Hennessey. But here's some more quality photos that my man Dan Lloyd, aka Usher #3, took. I'm sure you'll agree, they are great. Peace out, homies".     Arty.     Me and Andy J, who went on to play drums for the Irish band.     "Who'd play you in the film?"  "Steven Seagal. Or Titchie. They're the only ones. They've got the hand speed"     Mole, running about the place like a mad bastard. Shortly after, he tried to attach his mother's flowers on to his suit. Seriously.     Come to Spalding, where the trees are green, the rowers are plentiful, and the trains don't run.     Strangers don't like it when you turn around and take pictures of them.

      I'm getting a little worried that more people look at my stuff than I first thought.  First, on Monday, someone thanked me for wooing there picture because they are a big fan of my work, and they had used my squox pic on messageboards and MSN.  Then, I get this e-mail this morning...   Dear Customer,  Your bandwidth quota for the remaining month is less than 250MB. Please consider purchasing a bandwidth top-up from your 123-reg control panel.  Should your quota be exceeded or exhausted, your hosting will be disabled until the beginning of the next month.  Best Wishes,  The 123-reg Team   123-reg being my hosting company for the squox site.  I checked my stats, to see if I was approaching my limit of 1500MB a month. It turns out, in the first 9 days of June, 1322MBs of bandwidth has been used!  That's just fucking ridiculous, and considering the size of the images I use, can't possibly account for me posting them on b3ta, so people must actually be looking at the site.  Arse. 9 days into the month and I may have to upgrade my hosting.

      Welcome to the new era of A-MOL!  What does this new era bring? Erm... nicer fonts and less green.  Yes, the old one was looking shite, so I've loaded up a new template to make it all sparkly and new looking.  There are a few changes to make. I want to either restore Dan's A-MOL title or create a new one. I also want to alter the comments so you don't have to call up a new window. These changes may happen in the near future or it could be a while - when I get XP and good at Dreamweaver, I might merge the blog and  urlLink squox.co.uk  into one website. I could make it look better with CSS, but it's one of those things that looks simple, but can easily fall apart when you start messing about.  In the mean time, enjoy!  =  EDIT:   As you may have noticed, the title image is now up.  The comments thing is a bit strange. I noticed Blogger now include comments as part of the code now, so I can set it up through them. This would display the posts on the board. However, there are a couple of issues with this method.  *You need a Blogger account or you have to sign in as "Anon.", which is crap *I would loose the Haloscan comments that have already been made *I do not have the ability to edit posts, in case someone writes something I don't want in my comments boxes.  So, it looks like boring old Haloscan at the moment. I might have a look at the coding and see if there is a way to do it by changing the code to look for Haloscan and not Blogger comments.  I bet none of you give a flying fuck, do you?

      Guess who's printed off about 90 Orders Of Service, byatch! So fucking tiring and mindnumbingly dull, because my printer is having issues and I didn't trust it to print a big pile of card without jamming our destroying the paper, so I handfed the paper to it.   Though, I did get to watch Minority Report again while doing it, so no problems there, except of course, the last two minutes. Speilberg is getting a problem with how to finish a film - see A.I. which could have finished half an hour earlier without all those alien/robots who can resurrect his mummy for one day (which pisses me off even more when they cut out a whole sub-story with Daveigh Chase as a robot girl to fit in that garbage). Minority Report rules right until the bad guy dies (The power of Christ compels me not to say who the bad guy is, in case you haven't watched it) and then you have the bullshit happy ending, with Cruise and his pregnant wife and Samantha Morton living in a cottage full of books and sweaters. It could still have been redeemed with one line right at the end - "last year, there where over a hundred murders" - which would have added to the whole ambiguity of the story.  Anyway, the wedding is coming along nicely now - just have to sort out the ushers and best man's plans for Saturday morning and write a speech.  =  One month away from being an uncle now. My neice is still kicking and punching Jo's stomach to the point that you can make out body parts. Yesterday she made a move and I could make the outline of the individual fingers of her fist! Ew.  =  England not shit! Look like the diamond formation is dead. Nice to know that Heskey, in about 50 caps, has scored the same number of goals as Wayne Rooney and less than Darius Vassell.  Also learnt on Saturday night, watching The Greatest England XI on Channel 4, that Phil Neal, who played at right back, has scored the same number of goals as Emile, in about the same number of caps. The greatest England team, as voted by the same people who think Diana is one of the Greatest Britons and The Vicar Of Dibley is one of the Greatest British Sitcoms:  GK: Banks  LB: Pearce CB: Moore CB: Adams RB: Cohen  LM: Finney CM: Charlton CM: Gascoigne RM: Beckham (with 43% of the vote, 1% more than Stanley Matthews)  CF: Lineker CF: Shearer  The right-back was the hardest, mainly because we've never had an outstanding player in that position. Gary Neville made the top 3 shortlist, for fuck's sake!  And back to the real world, Leeds are making their first steps into the transfer market. We may have three signings by the end of the week:  *Jermaine Wright, Ipswich. (Bosman) *Steven McPhee, Port Vale, (Bos. Tribunal)  27 goals last year   and, er...  *DEANO!, West Ham (Bosman)  Also on the Bosman, we might be getting the calming influence of Danny Tiatto, Barry Hayles, Julian Joachim and Paul Butler. Who is a defender. From Wolves.   As for leaving Leeds in the near future, Dom Matteo may be off to Fulham or Man City. And finally, Fat Marco might be going. To Juventus. To replace David Trezeguet.   Mark Viduka to go to Juventus to replace Trezeguet.  It's apparently between Marco and Christian Vieri! I know which lazy, but sometimes brilliant part-Australian striker I'd go for out of the two.

      The b3ta challenge this week rules - Kid TV goes bad. It's been up 2 hours, and i've already posted three.    Bloody Asylum Seekers      Keep going, Kev, my son. He-he!      Israeli Bob     There are some great entries already -  urlLink this  being my current favourite, even though it's in incredibly bad taste.

      Got a letter yesterday, saying that I've had my police check and I'm officially cleared to work with Children and Vulnerable Adults. Huzzah!  I really cannot wait for September, because I really fucking hate my job at the moment, what with the shitty weather, the crappy train service this week due to the holidays and not being able to get home and play Splinter Cell.  =  Stuff I need to do for next week:   *Wedding speech  - coming along nicely. I think I've thanked everyone who needs thanking, but I think I need to remove a thin layer of cheese.   *Order Of Service Front Cover  - Arse. I've no idea what to do to put it in a good position between "Boringly bland" and "Clipart Hell". Any ideas appreciated.   *Shave  - I've got Mach 3 blades and King Of Shaves foam, so I think I'll manage it.  =  600 people complained about Derren Brown's Seance, making it the thrid most complained about programme (you have to go along way to beat Chris Morris and a showing of The Last Temptation Of Christ). 487 were made to Channel 4 itself, only 30 of which came AFTER broadcast, which made it clear that everything was staged and viewers were not going to be exposed to "dark powers". Stupid fuckers.   =  Here's an horrifically cliched b3ta pic I did. Enjoy.

      2 recent stories on  urlLink Punknews  have been raising more than a few eyebrows:  1)  Sum 41 nearly get blown up in the Congo  -  urlLink linkage       This story has appeared in several Canadian newspapers today. Ajax, Ontario pop-punk band Sum 41 was recently in the Democratic Republic of Congo to appear in a documentary titled From The Front Lines. A peace accord in the area was shattered as violence suddenly broke out between government soldiers and troops loyal to a renegade commander. The band was evacuated from the area and returned back in Canada on Tuesday. Here's an excerpt from a Toronto Star article:   The popular band was there with War Child Canada to shoot a documentary on the plight of children in war zones when violence escalated between rival factions of the Congolese army in the town of Bukavu, near the Rwandan border in the Democratic Republic of Congo.   "There were a couple of moments when I thought, 'This is it, we're going to die,' so we (the band) reflected on everything we went through and talked about our lives back home," [Deryck] Whibley said in an interview.   The band, tour manager, a music video director, a documentary filmmaker and two doctors from War Child Canada were holed up in the hotel for 25 hours. Mortar rounds exploded outside the hotel's shattered windows and sent panic through the 40 or so foreign visitors staying at the complex...   2)  Metal band beats the shit out of wussy emo-rock band at festival -    urlLink clicketh here    Last night at a festival in Indiana, Story Of The Year was attacked by the road crew of nu-metal band Godsmack after their performance at the show, sponsored by radio station WRZX.   OK, quiz time. Can you guess which band is Story Of The Year, and which is Godsmack? Winner gets a packet of British Airways peanuts, and a comedy small can of Pepsi.   A:   B:     It's tricky, I know.  One last thing - if you haven't already, go to  urlLink B3TA Newsletter 137 , and take a look at that squirrel band movie. It's 8meg, so go for a piss / make a cup of tea / have a  urlLink Peter O'Neale , and then sob uncontrollably about how bad you really are at computer graphics. Even you, Titchie.

      Okay, here's my recreation of the trick Derren Brown used last night to see if the participants could 'sense' which 'spirit' they were talking to.  Right, all these people are dead, but one of them is trying to communicate with you. Study the pictures for a while.     One of the colour photos should be attracting you. Focus on the colour photo, and try and get an idea of their personality.  Now, start looking left and right. A black and white image should now be attracting you. Focus on this black and white phot, and try and think of a word which was important to them.  Looking up and down, another colour photo should be getting you attention. Focus on it for a while.  Hold your breath. Now look diagonally in any direction from the colour picture and one of the black and white pictures should stand out. Breathe out once you can feel it.  The spirit's pull is getting stronger, keep looking left and right, left and right, until you have one of the colour photos in your mind. Focus on it.  Read the name.      Was Linda calling out to you?

         Didn't realise you get trophies for finishing fourth.   Fair play to Town though, and here's hoping they put that 1.2 million for Jon Stead to good use, so they can give Bradford a good thrashing next season.  ***********  Shittest news of the year, for me: guess who'll be stuck at 30,000ft above the ground watching crap films and One Foot In The Grave reruns while the rest of the English population gets the beers in for England v France?  Checked my weight for the first time in ages yesterday and realised I've lost a stone since I came to Korea (11st down from 12st). There you have it folks; substitute chips for rancid spicy cabbage, don't cook your meat, and weight loss is guaranteed!     He's lovin' it!

      Unlike other people on this site, I've got no problem with the laydeez. In fact, I got a lot of attention from four lovely young girls on Saturday night in Huddersfield.  Okay, they were paid.  Yep, Inno got his wish and got to see some lapdancers on a mate's stag do. And, thanks to my great mates, I got four lapdances. Lovely.   I will makes several things clear now. Titch did not go in, so no need for a divorce. TFMrs knows, since Pops knew and Danny and I have determined that they tell each other everything.  Also, quite a strange thing. While having a naked girl writhing over you isn't the worst way to spend a few minutes, I found the whole experience incredibly sexless. Bizarre. Plus, there is nothing in the world more uncomfortable than a BAD lapdance. Okay, a bad lapdance with Inno in the booth next door, with him talking throughout it.   =  Two films seen this Bank Holiday weekend, and you might get reviews, unless work has built up from having the last week off. On Sunday, TFMrs and I rented Paycheck, with Ben Affleck. For a John Woo film, it had surprising restrained action, and I forgot it was woo until the inevitable "dove in a gunfight". S'okay, but nowhere near as good as the other recent film based on Phillip K Dick story, Minority Report.   And today, we went and saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azakaban. It's the best of the lot, a biut like the books. There are a few scenes which are scary as fuck, such as the Dementors, Lupin's transformation and IAN BROWN'S face filling the screen. Chilling stuff.  =  Just watched Derren Brown's Seance. It was pretty creepy, despite the fact is was blatantly staged. There were a few moments which creeped me out, but I could tell the tricks he was playing. Texting with Inno, it became clear how he did one of the stunts, and I may demonstrate it later to show you how easy it was to work out.  =  Less than two weeks to the wedding. I'm shockingly calm, which is, in a way, making me nervous.

      To celebrate the start of my month-long holiday (come on!), here's the most rocking Flash game since  urlLink Disco Steve's "Party Time" Style Challenge :   urlLink Pisshead walking challenge   My best is 69 metres, but then this computer's mouse is shit.  ____________________________________________________  I heard San Andreas is going to be 4 times the size of Vice City, and parts of the city will be blocked off because of riots. You can also ride bicycles, just like one of the greatest games ever. Anyone remember this:     I'm ashamed by how many hours I spent playing that.  _____________________________________________________     Like a rocking version of Echo and the Bunnymen. I like it.  And, I bought Azumi yesterday. Ain't watched it yet, because I'd rather spend my last hours in Korea in a nice air-conditioned PC Room than sweating my arse off in my apartment.  See you fools next week, maybe.

      Cheers to Titch for this news on the game most likely to cause teenage murders in 2005.   urlLink From Spong.com    When it comes to anything GTA: San Andreas related, it’s impossible not to get just a little bit excited. It will be pretty much the biggest game ever, and a significant majority of the console owning populace have already decided that they will definitely buy this game immediately on release. There certainly won’t be a repeat of that whole DRIV3R debacle in this instance. It will be good, it will get good reviews, and most people will get a copy. It really is that simple.  Whilst Rockstar are notoriously reticent in revealing details and screenshots, information is slowly seeping through the information super-highway. Today, news has been revealed regarding health and nutrition for San Andreas’ lead character – CJ.  In a similar way to MGS 3: Snake Eater, noshing on a platter of grub is vital to survival. It’s a bit like the ‘hunger’ phenomenon experienced by real people like you or I. If you get hungry and don’t eat, then you get skinny and you die. It’s not a difficult concept to swallow.  However, Rockstar has taken the issue of chow one step further. CJ will actually have to consume a vaguely balanced diet, or at least keep an eye on the calorific content of various snacks. If he eats too much, he’ll bloat up like a spherical lard-bucket and pedestrians will diss him accordingly as he lumbers around like a sweaty, balding bear. Conversely, if he forgets to eat, his capacious trousers will begin slipping below his skeletal hips, and passing old ladies will be able to kick the shiznitz out of him. The key to health and happiness will be to eat sensibly and exercise regularly.  Given that the game is set in a mid-90s American city, this healthy diet thing could be tricky to get to grips with. Whilst CJ ought to be eating grilled tuna steak and fresh vegetables, possibly washed down with fruit juice and anabolic steroids, the choice instead is standard US fare.  But what of the dreaded “American Plug Syndrome”? No mention to date.*  There’s Burger Shot, Chicken Bell, Well Stacked Pizza and hot-dog stands. As yet, there has been no confirmation as to the inclusion of a Doner Kebab shop, although we are still desperately hoping for the inclusion of poisonous dog-meat and foot long skewers.  As soon as any more GTA news comes forward, and as soon as we get any fresh screenshots, this will be the spot to watch.  *Info on American Plug Syndrome available upon request   =  On a semi-related note, I suggested "Ban This Filth! - Fluff Up Video Games" for the B3ta challenge. Despite protests, this did not make the short list and we now have a wanky one about rhyming pictures. Real shame, since I made these pics preemptively, because so many thought it was a good candidate.   urlLink    Click for a bigger version        =  Remember me mentioing Google image searches which come up with horrific pictures. Well, in addition to "Pavarotti", "arrogant" and "yo", here's a new one:  "Frying Pan"

      Damned fucking bastard pension company. I cannot withdraw my pension as a lump sum, so it looks like I will be in poverty for a year. But hey, at least I’ll get an extra £2.56 a week when I’m 65, 70, or 75, depending on whatever fucking age they make us work to in the future.  Work have given me a project! Un-fucking-believable. It’s only a small one, but still.  The Mrs suddenly decided yesterday she wants to go camping, possibly in The Lakes. Arse. There goes my weekend of playing on the Playstation and staring at my niece. I don not see the appeal of camping. I went with Cubs and Scouts and it wasn’t that great. The last two times I slept in a tent, it was in the knowledge that I was going to see some good bands the next day.   And, just to make me really full of joy, The Daily Fucking Mail have started a “Ban this sick filth!” campaign to try and stop violent video games after some kid killed another kid due to an argument over the amount of money one owed the other for drugs… sorry… after playing Manhunt. Maybe if the fucking parents of this kid stopped him dealing drugs and enforced the classification on the video game, he wouldn’t be a murderous little shit. Who knows.

      &nbsp; Great times to lose a wallet:    When you're leaving the country in 4 days and you need your foreign ID for the stone-faced bastards at Korean Immigration  When you're heading home and finally get a chance you use your Switch and store discount cards  When you're heading to the immigration office to renew your visa, for which you need your foreign ID card, and 100,000 won (about 50 quid) that you took out of the bank hours earlier specifically for this purpose  When you're taking a bus route that's apparently run by 9 different bus companies and therefore&nbsp;damn near impossible to trace   If all of the above apply to you, then congratulations! You're officially as stupid as me.  When you lose money, especially as much as 50 pounds, it's funny how many times you run through what you had the opportunity to buy over the last few days, but didn't, because you thought you'd save some cash. Here, for no reason other than this room has air conditioning and I'm fucked if I'm getting up yet, is my 'bollocks, should have bought that' list:  In picture form!

      Trying to save  YOU  from Hollywood's really shitty movies. Here are reviews of  Catwoman    "So much talent wasted. So much money squandered. So much opportunity missed." -- Winda Benedetti, SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER  "So bad that I actually recommend you see it. It's the movie you and your friends will rip on all summer long." -- James Brundage, FILMCRITIC.COM  "It's bad enough that not only are careers over, but somebody should be slapped." -- Walter Chaw, FILM FREAK CENTRAL  "To cattily paraphrase from the Superman tagline - 'You won't believe a woman can purr!'" -- Michael Elliott, MOVIE PARABLES  "Most of the movie has the cruddy lighting and generic, death-by-franchise atmosphere of a third-rate spectacle that's been worked over by too many hacks." -- Owen Gleiberman, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY  "The Showgirls of superhero movies." -- Robert K. Elder, CHICAGO TRIBUNE  "Despite its feline pretensions, Catwoman belongs to another animal family -- it's either a dog or a turkey. Take your pick." -- James Berardinelli, REELVIEWS  "Catwoman doesn't belong on the big screen. It belongs in the litter box or to be scraped off the bottom of our shoes as we head quickly for another theater." -- Connie Ogle, MIAMI HERALD  "Halle just hacked a hairball all over the summer boxoffice. And it ain’t pretty." -- David Foucher, EDGE BOSTON  "Yes, this is a movie about killer cosmetics. Once you stop laughing at that, there's much more nonsense to endure. " -- Daniel M. Kimmel, WORCESTER TELEGRAM & GAZETTE   "If one good thing can come out of this film, it's that this should provide an everlasting blueprint for what not to do with a comic book film." -- Jeff Otto, IGN FILMFORCE   Ouch. "The Showgirls of superhero movies". Good to see Halle finally getting the reviews her work deserves.

       urlLink  Japanese kids can be called Buttocks or Prostitute     Japanese children can be named "Buttocks" or "Prostitute" after a row between parents and officials over a new list of acceptable names.  Japan's system of writing, which has evolved from ancient Chinese script, was simplified after the Second World War when the government abolished thousands of characters.  In recent years, however, the authorities in Tokyo have been under pressure to reinstate obscure and archaic characters so that more interesting and original names can be created, says the Daily Telegraph.  Traditional ones such as Hanako, a girl's name meaning "Flower Child", and Manabu, a boy's name meaning "Studious", have fallen out of favour.  As a result, the justice ministry proposed an additional 578 characters for names, but included dozens that most parents might view as poor taste, such as "Piles" and "Vagina".  A language review panel working for the ministry had initially decided it was not its place to make moral judgments on characters - instead leaving it up to parents to exercise their own common sense.  But this week, the ministry said public pressure had forced it to withdraw nine of the most controversial characters, including "Rape", "Excrement" and "Cancer".

       My Dear,  Your condition is so pitied after reading through your mail. Meanwhile I thank you very much for your sincere desire to help me transfer this money to your bank account.  As you requested for 750 thousand dollars, I will not be against you taking it out as soon as the money is been transfered to your bank account. But the problem is that you have to contact the bank directly as my husband's partner and instruct them to transfer the money to your bank account and by this, you can be sure that I am not hiding any thing from you. I will also donate part of my share of the money for the project you are fighting against and also be an activist too. Here in africa, so many people are against the cloning.  Let me know your decision so that I will furnish you with all details regarding the deposited money and the contact details of the bank.  I am wishing you a lovely new week.  My Warm Regards  Janet and son   = 12:40pm Update:   Mrs Sisulu,  Thank you for your kind words, but I do not want your pity. I am a proud man. Besides, with my second marriage approaching, I have a lot to be cheerful about.  Could you please send me details of the bank and your account. It would allow me to set-up an quasiquantum wire transfer (QQWT, very secure, very discrete) and check the veracity of your claims. It’s not that I don’t trust you Janet, but with my history, I believe I have a right to be a little paranoid. My doctor told me I should keep taking the pills he prescribed to control my paranoia, but I believe he has been contacted by certain authorities to keep me under control. HE LIES, JANET. That’s why I took his prescription, but then sold the pills outside a local bar.  I am glad Africa is being kept up to date about the dangers of cloning, Janet. I would hate the practise to spread to your already troubled continent. Thank for for your offer of a donation. I will contact you with details later on how to do this. Just to reassure you, the money will not do towards any activity that would cause harm to ordinary people. Only evil clones.  X   = 15:40pm Update   My Dear,   I am very glad to hear from you again today. Please my dear, do not be angry for my inability to give you the information you requested today. I want you to please send me your full name, private telephone and fax numbers including your residential or business address so that I will in return give you all the information you may need to contact the bank with and the depositing details as contained in the documents given to me by my husband.  I wish you the best of luck in your new marriage.

      This morning, my e-mail account contained the following sob story.  /starts "Our Tune" Music.   From:Mrs.Janet Sisulu and son Abidjan,Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa.  Dear, Greetings to you,Please permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you,which will be of a mutual benefits between both of us.  I am Mrs.Janet Sisulu,the widow of Late Mr.Kevin Sisulu ,from South Africa.There is an information I would like you to keep confidential for security reason.  There is sum amount of money my Late husband a well known Gold and a Diamond Merchant in Southern Africa deposited in a Fixed suspence account in a Bank here in Abidjan,the commercial capital of Cote d'Ivoire in West Africa where we are at this moment.  Before his death in the Hospital,he called me on his sick bed and told me that I am the next of kin to the money and also gave me every informations of this fund in a Bank and also told me where the documents regarding to the deposit of the fund that was issued to him by the Bank were kept in our home and he gave me an instruction to look for a foreign partner who will be willing to assist me in investing the fund wisely abroad and not to invest in Africa due to our name popularity.  I will not be able to give you the full details that led to his untimely death.The result of his test says he was poisoned and he (my husband) said he knew the people that were behind it because of jealousy of his wealth.  Since the death of my husband late last year I have been asking myself why do I have to pass this life sorrowing and feeling the pains,since he died I have not recovered from the shock and I did not only lost my husband,I also lost his houses,but the only thing that keeps me going is this fund which is going to help me start up a new life,this is why I am seeking for your kind assistance.I have never know a moment of happiness in the course of my sojourn into this country.  I have ask God if he created me to shed tears and reflect upon disappointment in all my life. Now, as I try to bring back into my mind the backlog of the events that from the nucleus of the story I am telling you,I blame nobody but I believe in one thing that God will one day put a smile on my face and I will find joy and be happy in future.I know every man is an achitect of his own fortune, I must tell you I decided to contact you for help and I will not be able to draw any attention to my plight and elicit some sympathy,could it be for the fact that I am presently going through the most painfull aspect of my life in this country,I am in a confused situation .  I know from the moment that my husband died my world became as useless as a burning thatch house,that my race against time had begun.please I need your help,I will never succeed in trying to paint the picture of the agony I am going through here,if you have lost someone who is so dear to you in an unexpected circumstances you will probably understand what I am going through or what I am experiencing now.  The amount involved is the sum of US$7.5million dollars (Seven million five hundred Thousand united states Dollars),I want you to assits me to get the fund transfer into your account from the Bank.  Because of the present political problem here in Cote d'Ivoire, I don't want to loose the only property that is my only hope of living.I and my son have agreed to offer you 10% of the total sum for your kind gesture and assitance after the fund has been transfer into your account,I want to assure you that there is no atom of risk involved in this transaction.  I want you to assist me in negotiating for a good and profitable business where the balance of the fund after giving you your 10% will be invested in your country for my future up-keep.If you are willing to help me,and can maintain the very confidentiality of this transaction to avoid what happened to my late husband to happen to us,please E-mail me immediately for more clearification.  please understand that I am a God fearing woman and I will never disappoint you when the money get into your account.  Thank you very much and May God richly bless you in all your Endearvours.  Mrs.Janet Sisulu and son.   Shit! I feel sorry for Kevin's widow, but somehow, I do not believe getting my hands on $750,000 is going to be that easy.  I feel I should write to her and offer some help. Does anyone want to suggest any questions for 'clearification'?  =  Well, since I got NO replies after 30 minutes, I decided, inspired by  urlLink ebolamonkeyman , to reply...   Mrs. Sisulu,   I was sorry to hear about Kev’s passing. My wife, Bev, passed away in similar fashion. I believe this may be due to us getting too close to The Truth. Bev and I have campaigned against the New World Order for several years. Bev died only 2 weeks after I had an article published in the Daily Mail about the obvious signs showing how our entire government is being slowly replaced by genetically engineered clones. Coincidence? Definitely not. I was in mourning for a long time, and felt as useless as a chocolate teapot. Fortunately, I met a lovely girl, Lola, at her wake and we are expecting our first child.  As you can understand, because the super clones are trying to track me down, I cannot have a bank account. However, if you send me a cheque, I can open the bank account in the name of Don Incognito. I want you to know just how serious I am. The $750k can be used to educate the population of the UK on the severe dangers of being governed by clones.  Since I’m being monitored by MI5 constantly (apparently, I’m a “dangerous nutjob”), I have to constantly change my e-mails. Reply to this e-mail to the address donkeyjam34@aol.com if you want to continue the conversation.  Hope to speak to you again.  X

      It's starting to get a bit real now - I'm having to buy my rail season ticket weekly instead of monthly. 3 weeks today is my last day at my job.  I started to believe a bit ago that the decision to quite my job and go into teacher training was a bit of a brave, unlikely act. Turns out, I'm Mr Fucking Average.   urlLink   Turning to teaching      New teachers are increasingly entering the profession later in life, often after training in another career first.  An analysis of Teacher Training Agency data, published today, shows that where in the past the majority of would-be teachers trained straight after university, more than half are now aged 25 and over.  Under the increasingly popular employment-based graduate teacher programme, 94% of trainees are mature.  The scheme is also proving far more successful than university-based training in attracting men, significantly under-represented in primary schools. Almost a quarter of employment-based primary trainees are male, compared with only 12% at university.  Alan Smithers, head of Liverpool University's centre for education and employment research, said late entrants to teaching brought expertise gained in other careers.  Professor Smithers said: "This can work very well for school because people are bringing experience of real life with them. Late entry can also be an advantage given behaviour issues in schools - I think teachers are more likely to command respect if there is a bit of distance."  Employment-based training has also helped boost the numbers of maths and science teacher trainees. The number of trainees gaining qualified teacher status was 29,094, up 14% on the previous year.   Ah well.  It is confirmed 100% now that I am spending my two weeks at St. Paulinus. I don't find out anything else about the course or which schools I'll be working in until Friday 10th September. Now all I have to do is work out what teachers actually wear nowadays.

       urlLink Panic at Nigerian 'killer calls'      Nigerian mobile phone users have been anxiously checking who is calling them before answering them in recent days.         A rumour has spread rapidly in the commercial capital, Lagos, that if one answers calls from certain "killer numbers" then one will die immediately.       A BBC reporter says experts and mobile phone operators have been reassuring the public via the media that death cannot result from receiving a call.       He says that in such a superstitious country unfounded rumours are common.            A list of alleged killer numbers has been circulated but no-one is reported to have died from answering the phone.         The BBC's reporter in Lagos, Sola Odunfa, says that the current scare story is reminiscent of a rumour that spread a few years ago that a handshake could cause sexual organs to disappear.       That rumour turned to tragedy as mobs rounded on people accused of making organs disappear.        Despite the massive public interest, no-one was found to have lost their organs.         ==            Couple of pics I did for b3ta today:

               Spider-Man 2        Ah, here we go. A superhero sequel. So, essentially, two questions:       *Is it better than the original?     *Is it an X-Men 2 or a Batman and Robin?       Let's see...       It's two years since the end of the first film, and Peter Parker's life is falling apart under the pressure of being a superhero - he keeps losing his job; he's behind in his studies; his aunt is behind on her mortgage payments; his best friend, Harry Osborn, hates him because of his "friendship" with Spider-man, who he believes killed his father, and the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson, has found a new man after he rejected her in an effort to protect her. As these pressures mount, the stress causes him to lose his spider powers and he starts to wonder whether the superhero game is for him. Unfortunately, as all this is going on, Dr Otto Octavius is injured in an Oscorp experiment, causing him to become fused with four mechanical, AI controlled arms.       Coming into this film, you largely expect at lot of action and set-pieces. The film delivers in this aspect, but, like the X-Men films, this is a character driven film. The actual scenes with ‘Spider-Man’ aren’t that many, instead concentrating on Peter Parker trying to make changes to his life and reacting as if falls apart around him.       The two Spider-Man films so far follow the same order as the Superman films from the 70s – the first has the origin, leaving the last hour for all the action, while the second is based around the character giving up his powers before coming up against a formidable foe.    This comparison seems valid, because like the Superman films, I believe many will call the sequel the better film (Two notes – 1: They are wrong. Superman is much, much better that Superman 2. 2: This relationship between the two franchises is used as a joke in one scene, and I’m the only one who got it. I think I’m a geek.)       Sam Raimi has managed to create a film that is true to the comic book origins. He manages to combine action with humour and heart-felt emotion. It’s incredible how funny a film is when it also finds time to discuss at length the loss of two characters father figures. It’s a real credit to the director and Tobey Maguire that you can feel a real attachment to a guy who dresses in red spandex and swings around rooftops.       The cast are top-notch throughout, the weakest link possibly being Kirsten Dunst’s MJ, but that may be down to the character not being given much to do but sulk, pout and scream. Maguire, as said, brings the human side to Spider-Man to the fore, while being believable in the action sequences. James Franco is excellent as Harry Osborn, lurching from confident businessman to screwed up young man convincingly throughout. The real scene-stealer is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper editor who wishes to discredit Spider-Man. Every scene he’s in, he captures the character perfectly and has a number of cracking lines.       With every new superhero film comes a new villain. Alfred Molina is excellent as Doc Ock, giving him an air of menace but still maintaining an edge of sympathy with the character as he loses control to the robotic arms that have become part of his body. The arms of Doc Ock add a lot to this film, having characters of their own. They are the stars of one of the best moments of the film – the destruction of an operating theatre as doctors try to remove them from Doc Ock’s body.       As well as the excellent work on the arms, the special effects team have shown their worth in the creation of CGI Spider-Man. Whereas many felt this was the weakness in the first film, the new CGI Spidey looks weighter and more detailed, giving a better sense of what a real body flying through the air on webs would look like.       All in all, this is an excellent film, improving on the first and is possibly as good as X-Men 2. It possibly isn’t 100% perfect, but that may be fan boy nit-picking (though, I preferred the end of 1 than I did that of 2). I highly recommend seeing probably the only summer blockbuster that delivers all that it promises. And expect more – the producers have said at least two more are in the pipeline, and if the villains that are suggested by this film are used in the next ones, they could be just as good.       5/5

      To be honest, I did fuck all this weekend. I went to see Spider man 2 (more later), cleaned up a bit, went for a meal with my Grandma for her birthday and that's it. Other than that, it was round at the house helping out with the baby and such. My one moment of triumph, getting her to sleep on Sunday morning when Jo had gone out and there was Debra, dad and me in the house, and those two had failed. Go, Cool Uncle Al!    =    I finally decided to do something about my laptop playing up, so I got a new Virus Scan, McAfee's. It found 2 viruses, then with an internet update, another 3.  That's pretty shit, considering I pretty much know how to protect myself online.    So, basically, I am going to run scans with McAfee, Spybot and Adaware, because so much shit gets on my machine from pretty safe surfing.

             Here she is - my niece. Finally got to meet her tonight. I know in the  pictures, she does look a bit odd, but she is in truth one of the  prettiest babies I've ever seen. She has a full head of dark hair and  incredibly long toes.             So far, I've seen her perform the following acts:      *Crying   *Hicupping   *Sneezing   *Vomiting up mucus      The bottom two are due to the need for newborns to clear out their respiratory system. Nice.             Jo is doing well. She looked tired and pale, but seems to have taken to being a mother easily.      I got mocked for being broody. Why? Because I picked Felicity up when she was crying! What was I meant to do, leave her?             A quick question for tech minded people - I need a cheap or free movie  editor. I have a movie of her squirming about and hicupping and was  going to put it on line, but I think 4Mb for 15sec of 'action' is a bit  much.

Will say more when I know details and stuff.  =  EDIT: 8am 16/6/04  Felicity was born weighing 7lb 1.5 oz and measuring 52cm. I think that's "small to average" size, which is great, since they thought she was underweight in the womb.  Haven't seen her yet - they don't allow many visitors into the delivery room, so I have to wait until tonight before I see her. Should get pictures tomorrow.

      For fuck's sake, Jo is having the longest delivery in history.  Got my annual pension statement yesterday. Not only did it tell me my provisional date of retirement, depending on no changes to the retirement age or death, (2043!) but how much I've saved.   Bizarrely, if I've read it correct, and I'm going to check with our finance bod in a bit, if I cash in my pension, with the training wage to become a teacher, I will have about the same, or slightly less, money after August 13th to my next job than I would from my current salary. Considering I wouldn't have to pay for the ticket to York every month, I'm probably better off studying for a year! And, I'll have an NUS card - so I'll get discounts for my necessary shirt/ties/pants that I'll have to buy (damn my companies "casual wear" policy - I could have had a right collection by now).  If we also take into account time in work, I'm going to be better off again! I lose two hours a day from travelling, and another 30 mins when I come in early to avoid the rush hour. Also, schools finish early, and even if there are days when I need to plan future lessons and write essays, it's probably still going to give me a lot more time than my current position.  All in all, I think this idea is sounding better all the time.

      Already banned in South Korea, lets aim for the double and attract the North's attention too.  Genuine news article from yahoo:   SEOUL, South Korea - North Korean leader Kim Jong Il has introduced hamburgers to his reclusive, communist country in a campaign to provide "quality" food to university students, media reported Wednesday.   The hamburgers were introduced in 2000 and dubbed "gogigyeopbbang," Korean for "double bread with meat," according to the June 29 edition of the North Korean state-run newspaper Minju Joson. The report was carried by South Korea (news - web sites)'s Yonhap news agency on Wednesday.   Although reports from the isolated country have in recent years mentioned the introduction of the American fast food classic, the latest announcement seems to credit the country's leader for their advent.   The news marks a curious development for North Korea (news - web sites), where U.S. consumerism is routinely reviled in the official media and people refer to the soft drink Coca Cola as the "cesspool water of American capitalism."      Wednesday's report cites leader Kim Jong Il as saying at the time of the hamburger's introduction:   "I've made up my mind to feed quality bread and french fries to university students, professors and researchers even if we are in (economic) hardship."     The government then built a hamburger plant and Kim Jong Il ordered officials to pay close attention to modernizing mass production, the report was quoted as saying by Yonhap.   Hamburgers from the factory were first provided only to students at the elite Kim Il Sung University in Pyongyang, but were later provided to other schools, the daily said.   Hamburgers are now familiar to many North Koreans, it added.     You can bet that Mr Kim won't be dipping his chips in  urlLink this , that's for sure.  Coming next week - the presidential race heats up as George W Bush "makes up his mind" to serve delicious spicy fermented cabbage to the armed forces in these times of (military) unrest, calling it "Weird red shit in a little dish".

I'm going to be ultra nice to everyone today - including this animation for people I would normally have a go at:     and I started a  urlLink post to explain my conversion , with a picture my lovely wife helped me make.     Let's see how long I can keep it up...  BTW, you may notice another link in the thread, just to show  urlLink how "nice" mother-to-be inferior can be . And I'm a problem on B3ta!

      Third and final visit to the hospital today to get the rest of my stitches out (all 16 of 'em). Can't be arsed to take a picture, but at the moment it's big and red and swollen (oof), kind of like you'd expect it to be when you've had 16 bits of material sticking in it for the better part of a week. So you'll just have to wait till I get home before you go "You never had 16 stitches in that, you lying bastard". Suffice to say, it's a lot less serious than this:     Now, for all those headed to Bruges this weekend, here's some survival French. I think they predominantly speak French rather than Flemish there.  "Excusez-moi monsieur, où puis-je recevoir un danse de recouvrement?" - Excuse me sir, where can I get a lap dance?   "Ne l'arrêtez pas! Il est nu parce qu'il va se marier le mois prochain!" - Don't arrest him! He's naked because he's getting married next month!   "Il doit rester dehors. Sa femme veut qu'il n'entre pas un tel établissement" - He has to stay outside. His wife won't let him go inside a place like this   "Mon genou a l'odeur de chatte?" -(The infamous) Does my knee smell of minge?

      Found this old e-mail which once did the rounds - it made me giggle, despite it's age.  All are true excerpts from the Queen Mother's Book Of Rememberance...  "I think that the Queen Mum and Princess Diana are our very own Twin Trade Towers. At last we can look the people of New York in the face".  L.Ward, Mansfield.   "When Diana died I swore I would never smile again, but eventually I did. Now the Queen Mum has gone I cannot image that I will ever smile for the rest of my life, but I will probably break that one too".  A.Christie,Hendon.   "She was one of the old school, all the remaining royals are shit"  J.Clement. Grantham.   "I thought she would never die, she has let us all down very badly."  D.Holmes, Somerset.   "She was a trooper and she never gave up. I remember one time she was visiting a school and I asked her if she would like to make a visit to the cloakroom before she left. 'No' she replied, 'I didn't give in to the Nazis and I won't give in to the bladder'. That's how she was, a fighter, who refused to be beaten by anything. She pissed herself later though, it was sickening".  B. Forrester, North Yorkshire.   "She was a marvelous woman, and a wonderful lover".  L. J.Worthington, Penrith.   "I am absolutely devastated, at least we could have got the day off".  S.Wilson, Bristol.   "How refreshing to be able to mourn the death of a member of the Royal family without being accused of being homosexual".  J. Fletcher, High Wycombe.   "Her death should act as a warning to others who think it is cool to experiment with drugs".  E. Franks, Cheshire.   "On behalf on all blacks, I send the sincerest condolences".  T.Watson, Ilford.   "Perhaps if we automated her old golf buggy it could still drive around The Mall on its own and bring pleasure to the tourists".  Y. Howell, Slough.   "Once again the Queen is not upset enough for my liking, the woman should have a bit more compassion, how would she feel if it was her mother?"  W.Waugh, Richmond.   "It is such a loss, God has shat on our heads".  K. O'Neil, Inverness.   "I am sure the Queen Mum will not let this setback put an end to her public duties".  N. Wallace, Swansea.   "I hold Princess Margaret in no small way responsible for this terrible event".  E. Thompson, West Lothian.   "Bomb Iraq for us Tony, its the only thing that will make us feel better".  P.McGregor, Southampton.   "We must do all we can, send blankets, food parcels, jumpers, anything to help these brave souls who are queuing up to walk past her coffin".  R. Thompson, Bath.   "I have been unable to masturbate for five days, and will not do so again until her majesty is buried"  E. Gorman, Derbyshire.   "Good God, who is next, Geri Halliwell?".  R. Combes, Romford.   "No matter how she felt, no matter the situation, she always wore a smile. Just like a retard"  G. Hollins, East Sussex.   "I remember she came to visit us in the East End one time. She was so kind, so generous and so sweet. She whispered softly in my ear, 'you know its not true' she said, 'you don't smell of shit'. She was a wondrous person".  E.Collier, London.   "Whichever way you look at it, it just is not as exciting as Diana".  G.Williams, West Midlands.   "She was one of us, and by that I don't mean she perpetrated insurance fraud or lied about expense claims. She was like us in a good way. God bless you ma'am".  L. Weller, Harlow.   "If only I could get my hands on that fish bone right now, you heartless bastard!".  J. Hedges, Cowdenbeath.   "She had such a difficult life, always battling against adversity and misfortune. Let us hope that if there is a next time round she is given a life of privilege and comfort".  T.D.Wainwright, Hastings.   =   urlLink A bizarre bug from Microsoft .

      Ah, The Sun. Looks like they've gone and got themselves in the shit again. This time, it's all due to Roo-mania.  You see Rooney has signed on with The Sun and sister paper NotW. This could be seen as naive and a bit stupid, because a lot of football fans have never forgiven the paper for printing, as they declared, "The Truth" about the Hillsborough disaster in 1989. As Rooney has started to get a bit of stick for this and The Sun would hate their new cash cow to become vilified, Rebekah Wade,  Murdoch's whore  The Sun editor and wife of one-note actor, Ross Kemp, decided on this editorial.   IT is 15 years since The Sun committed the most terrible mistake in its history.  By making grave and untrue allegations about the behaviour of Liverpool fans during the Hillsborough disaster, we enraged the city.  But more importantly, we tarnished the memory of 96 soccer fans who had tragically lost their lives.  And our carelessness and thoughtlessness following that blackest of days made the grief of their families and friends even harder to bear.  We long ago apologised publicly to the victims’ families, friends and to the city of Liverpool for our awful error.  We gladly say sorry again today: fully, openly, honestly and without reservation.  If there was any way we could take back our erroneous words of 15 years ago, and by so doing ease the deep anguish we caused to so many people in mourning, we would do it.  But there isn’t. We can only hope that time will be the great healer.  Sadly, for some people in the city of Liverpool, forgetting — never mind forgiving — is impossible.  If they want to hate The Sun, then that is their right. We are hardly in a position to blame them.  What we find impossible to take, though, is the way some of Liverpool is turning its anger on one of the greatest footballing talents the city has ever seen.  Wayne Rooney is one of Liverpool’s finest sons.  At 18, he is the nation’s hero of Euro 2004 and has the potential to outscore England legends like Jimmy Greaves, Bobby Charlton and Alan Shearer.  On Merseyside, his name should be the toast of every pub, street and school.  Instead, he is being vilified by some Liverpool and Everton fans.  We can understand the grief of those who lost loved ones at Hillsborough.  We do not condemn the outspoken words of men like John Glover, whose son died in the tragedy, for his loss entitles him to hold any opinion he wishes.  But the words of other fans leave us in despair.  Wayne Rooney was just three years old at the time of Hillsborough. He and his fiancee Coleen are devastated by this unfair backlash. He should not be punished in 2004 for a mistake The Sun made in 1989. Don’t visit our past sins on him.  One view on a Liverpool website is that by telling his life story in The Sun, Wayne has “signed his soul away to the devil.”  Another is that he has “accepted 30 pieces of silver.”  For goodness sake, give the lad a chance.  It’s not as if Wayne’s the first footballer from Merseyside to talk to The Sun.  We have enjoyed a good working relationship with many players and managers over the years.  And nearly all Liverpool-born celebrities regularly talk to Britain’s favourite daily newspaper.  What The Sun finds most depressing about what is going on in Liverpool is the way trouble is stirred up by the local papers, the Post and the Echo.  Who owns the Post and Echo?  None other than Trinity Mirror.  The same company that owns The Sun’s rival, the Daily Mirror.  The misery being inflicted on Wayne Rooney is a crude effort by them to make commercial gain.  We hope that the people of modern Liverpool, a city of spirit and sophistication, are not taken in.  A brilliant young athlete, a credit to his club, his city and his country, is being pilloried by the very people who should be hailing him a hero.  And The Sun of 2004 no more deserves to be hated on Merseyside than Wayne Rooney does.  For a start, most of today’s staff weren’t on The Sun in 1989 and today’s Editor was a 20-year-old student.  Many of the callers to BBC Radio Merseyside have acknowledged that fact.  Fifteen years is a long time.  It is 11 years longer than the First World War, nine years longer than the Second World War.  We cannot believe these protests properly represent the opinions of the majority of men and women in Liverpool.  No one will ever forget the terrible Hillsborough tragedy, nor those who died and their loved ones.  But trashing a young man of whom everyone should be proud is not the way to honour their memory.  It is time to move on.   So, just to clarify:  * It was fifteen years ago. We've decided to finally apologise in some fashion. * Because it was fifteen years ago, we hoped you would have forgotten by now * No-one would care if it wasn't for The Mirror getting you wound up.  As a reminder - here's a story from the Guardian website:   It all started on the Wednesday following the Hillsborough disaster in April 1989, when MacKenzie was about to make what he later described as a "fundamental mistake".  According to Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie in their definitive history Stick it Up Your Punter - the Rise and Fall of the Sun, MacKenzie spent an unusual amount of time deliberating over the fateful headline for that day's paper.  "MacKenzie then did an enormously uncharacteristic thing. He sat for fully half an hour thinking about the front page layout."  According to the book he pondered two headlines, one that was rejected reading "You Scum", and the one that was eventually used - and was to prove the biggest disaster for the paper's reputation and sales: "The Truth".  A team of about 18 journalists and photographers had been send to cover the story, and although reporter Harry Arnold sought out MacKenzie to caution against reporting allegations as truth, MacKenzie pressed on.  Having decided to lay the blame on the fans' doorsteps, there was no stopping him.  Under the headline "The Truth" there were three subheadings:  Some fans picked pockets of victims Some fans urinated on the brave cops Some fans beat up PCs giving the kiss of life  The story read as follows: "Drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims of the Hillsborough soccer disaster, it was revealed last night.  "Police officers, firemen and ambulance crew were punched, kicked and urinated upon by a hooligan element in the crowd.  "Some thugs rifled the pockets of injured fans as they were stretched out unconscious on the pitch.  "Sheffield MP Irvine Patnick revealed that in one shameful episode a gang of Liverpool fans noticed that the blouse of a girl trampled to death had risen above her breasts.  "As a policeman struggled in vain to revive her, the mob jeered: 'Throw her up here and we will **** her'"  The story went on: "One furious policeman who witnessed Saturday's carnage stormed: 'As we struggled in appalling conditions to save lives, fans standing further up the terrace were openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead."  A 'high-ranking' police officer was quoted as saying: "The fans were just acting like animals. My men faced a double hell - the disaster and the fury of the fans who attacked us."  Kenny Dalglish, then Liverpool manager, later addressed the story in his autobiography:  "When the Sun came out with the story about Liverpool fans being drunk and unruly underneath a headline 'The Truth,' the reaction on Merseyside was one of complete outrage. Newsagents stopped stocking the Sun. People wouldn't mention its name. They were burning copies of it. Anyone representing the Sun was abused.  "Sun reporters and photographers would lie, telling people they worked for the Liverpool Post and Echo. There was a lot of harassment of them because of what had been written. The Star had gone a bit strong as well, but they apologised the next day. They knew the story had no foundation. Kelvin MacKenzie, the Sun's editor, even called me up.  "'How can we correct the situation?" he said.  "'You know that big headline - 'The Truth',' I replied. 'All you have to do is put 'We lied' in the same size. Then you might be all right.'  "Mackenzie said: 'I cannot do that.'  "'Well,' I replied, 'I cannot help you then.'  "That was it. I put the phone down. Merseysiders were outraged by the Sun. A great many still are."  It was four years later that the then publicity-averse Kelvin MacKenzie went public for the first time about the calamitous decision to call Liverpudlians liars and thieves who preyed off the dying and dead.  "I regret Hillsborough," he said. "It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said. It was a Tory MP. If he had not said it and the chief superintendent had not agreed with it, we would not have gone with it," he told the Commons national heritage committee in January, 1993.  However, the Hillsborough survivors' group felt his words amounted to a less than sufficient apology.   And while  Rupert's cunt  Wade wasn't at The Sun 15 years ago, let's just have a quick reminder of what she has achieved in her time.  *Nearly got The Soham case thrown out after printing Huntley's picture in story about paedophiles during the trial *Had to come clean that the paper often paid police for stories *The 'Bonkers Bruno' headline *Signed Rio Ferdinand to a Euro 2004 Column - before he got banned  And last, but not least:  *Achieving the lowest sales in 30 years  Which, of course, is a record which could be beaten after this half-assed apology.

      Right, after the best part of a day, and calling in an expert in web design from Ookmedia, I have managed to make it so that the comments are visible on the board!  I've wanted this for a while, but it also has the advantage that it MIGHT be visible to people, say, in countries where blogspot is seen as a bit naughty and you have to use a remote proxy server.  At the minute it looks a bit rough and ready, but I'm planning on twatting about and making it a bit neater.  If people are having problems with it making the page look a bit funny, hit F5 or Ctrl+F5 for a bit, then contact me, telling me which browser you are using. I've tested it and as far as I can see, it works in the A-MOL browser of choice,  urlLink Firefox , and in shitty ol' Explorer.  =  Still not an uncle. For fuck's sake...

      Daft bastards this week: me, for walking into a glass door, damn near breaking my nose and getting half a dozen stitches in my face. All this in the comfort of my own home, 5am Saturday morning, while completely sober.  Still, I got the week off work, so it ain't all bad.

      Felling hungry? Bored of Pot Noodles? Try  urlLink Edible.com! . There, you can buy some of the following:   Civet Coffee  This is the rarest and most definitely extraordinary coffee in the world! This coffee has been selected for us by paradoxurus hermaphroditis. Better known as the Common Palm Civet Cat. It prowls the Sumatran coffee plantations at night, choosing to eat only the finest, ripest cherries. The stones (which eventually form coffee beans) are then collected by cleaning through the droppings.  Kopi Luwak as it is known, is considered to be the finest coffee by native Sumatrans. Kopi Luwak has a rich chocolate like flavour and no aftertaste, which is unique. This flavour is due to the fact the coffee has been partially fermented by passing through the digestive system of the Kopi. Only about 50 kilos of this coffee is collected per year making it the ultimate in uniqueness and rarity!   Monkey Picked Tea  No it�s not another wind up, this variety of tea is picked not by plantation workers, but by specially trained monkey�s, yes, really!  Monkey picked tea leaves are famous in their native China, and get their name from the fact that trained monkeys have to pick them � the name does not refer to a particular type of tea, but monkey picked tea comes from the leaves of wild tea plants that grow in inaccessible places, such as on high cliff faces, so to harvest them people train special monkeys. The  monkeys are very well cared for and their parents before them did the same job, so it has become ingrained into them and they wouldn�t be happy doing anything else. The tea is very highly fragrant and is lower in tannins and caffeine than other teas, and rich in antioxidants, the tea has a pale golden colour when brewed and is best served without milk, to taste its full delicate flavour.   Chilli Worm Crisps  These tasty little snacks are oven baked not fried! The worms are farm raised specially for human consumption by Edible. and are fed on a diet of select grains and cereals. There is approximately 15 worms per bag, they taste very similar to toasted popcorn and are seasoned with chilli.   Snake Vodka  Edible�s snake vodka contains a farm raised wolf snake, which has been specially bred for us in China. We infuse the vodka with the snake for three months, which then imparts a unusual flavour into the vodka, which is quite an acquired taste.  Alcohol infused with a snake is said to be an aphrodisiac, particularly for men and it is also supposed to contain many health properties.  Our snake vodka is best served straight from the freezer, neat, but it is also pleasant with a simple mixer.  * whilst the snake is perfectly fine to eat, we do not recommend it, due to the fact it contains many tiny bones *

          Shrek 2   Shrek, on its release, shocked many people by its ability to break the Pixar/Disney computer animation stronghold, and beat Monsters Inc. to an Oscar. It’s popularity came from its subversive nature (“Lord Farquaad”, a gingerbread man shouting “Eat me!”) and its popshots at Disney (the lead animator being fired from the studio six year earlier) while still remaining a true fairytale in nature. The voice cast was pretty impressive as well, with Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy proving again, after his work in Mulan, that his best work nowadays comes when we can’t see him. As with every successful film, the idea of a sequel is banded about. Is Shrek strong enough to survive another instalment, or do pop culture references and unexpected hidden smut tire quickly?  The film picks up straight after the last – Shrek and Fiona return from honeymoon, to find Donkey, who’s been kicked out by his dragon girlfriend, and an invitation to Far Far Away Land, a Hollywood style kingdom, by Fiona’s parents, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews). Upon arriving to meet Fiona’s human parents, Shrek and the King have a fall out, upsetting Fiona and allowing the manoeuvrings of her Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), who wants her son, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), to marry into the royal family. Meanwhile, the King plots to remove his troublesome son-in-law by hiring a feared assassin – Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas).  I’m not ruining the plot in any major way by revealing that the story revolves around being “true to yourself” – it’s a tired old story that repeated use by Disney has worn very thin. The main crux with Shrek is how funny the jokes and references are on the journey. In this area, Shrek has to be considered a success. The range of jokes is phenomenal. There is the basic level for the young to enjoy – farting ogres and the like. The main shock is the range of jokes in there for the older people to enjoy - digs at Disney musical numbers with dancing furniture; film references from the likes of From Here to Eternity and Predator; the sexual orientation of Pinocchio; the metaphysical jokes, poking fun at the movie itself (“the position of annoying animal sidekick is taken”); jokes at modern culture, with townspeople fleeing a destroyed coffee shop straight into an identical shop across the street. Nearly every one of these hits home, and even if it doesn’t, there’s another one just behind it that will.   Two of the new characters, Puss In Boots (a Latino, smooth deadly hitman, who can use his inherent cuteness to his advantage) and the Fairy Godmother (a world worry social climbing schemer, with a talent for show-stopping musical numbers and a sweatshop factory producing potions), steal the film. Both are brilliantly realised and you can tell that both Banderas and Saunders are enjoying themselves.    There are downsides. As mentioned, the plot has been done death. There is also the music – as in the first film, with Smash Mouth and The Eels, there is an alt-rock soundtrack, but this is ruined by some appalling song choices, including a criminal version of David Bowie’s “Changes”. There is also a bizarre attempt at adapting the film for international audiences. The change of The Ugly Sister from Larry King in the US version to Jonathan Ross in the UK doesn’t really hamper the film, but does seem unnecessary, as King is known on this side of the Atlantic. This is nothing to the change from Joan Rivers, who has a distinctive voice and is well known worldwide for introducing people on the red carpet on Oscars night, is replaced by Kate Thornton, sometime journalist and presenter who is barely known outside of her own house.  While it does have it’s flaws, Shrek 2 is a brilliant piece of popcorn cinema, where you can just lie back and enjoy yourself. I’d highly recommend it, but just hope Dreamworks realise that the formula is just about stretched now and don’t produce a Shrek 3.   4/5

      I feel i can make hair dye puns now that my grey patches are becoming less "patchy". (And, no, I'm not going to change it even if The Mirror have the same headline).  Anyway I'm not going to say that much, but here's the  A-MOL Euro 2004 Awards . Enjoy!   Team Of The Tournament: Greece  No surprise really. They are a basically a bunch of mediocre players brought together to become a formidable unit.   Player Of The Tournament: Traianos Dellas  The Greeks built themselves around a solid defence, and this guy was the cornerstone. Strong, pretty nippy and has good distribution. To think he played for Sheffield United. Other players I’d consider for this are Carvalho and Baros.   Goal Of The Tournament: Jon Dahl Tomasson vs Sweden  Maniche, Rooney, Ibrahimovic and Heinz all scored some beauties, but this dipping, curling, long range half-volley was the best.   Game Of The Tournament: England vs Portugal  People say Holland vs Czech Rep was a better game, but the first quarter-final had all the drama you needed. A quick start, comebacks from both team, controversy over a (rightly) disallowed goal and a penalty shootout. What more can you ask? Well, apart from a win.   Best Piece Of Commentary: John Motson  “Koller and Stam look alike, having similar haircuts… not that they have hair.”   Best Piece Of Punditry: Ian Wright  “I’m a little dreadlocked teapot” – Wrighty brilliantly describing Edgar David’s ineffectual goal line defending.   Worst Team Of The Tournament: Germany  Four years ago, a scrappy 1-0 win against them for England was an achievement. Now, they lose to a Czech reserve team.   Worst Player Of The Tournament: Raul  Lazy, useless, disinterested. No one from Real Madrid had a good tournament, apart from Figo, who they’ve already said they are willing to let go.    Worst Miss Of The Tournament: Ivica Mornar vs France  Two minutes left, drawing with France, he gets the ball four yards from goal with Barthez stranded. Amazingly blazes over.   Worst Game Of The Tournament: Croatia vs Switzerland  Having to go on what I’ve heard really, but since Radio 5 managed to go through nearly 90 minutes without mentioning the game on the pitch, you’d have to say it was pretty dull.   Worst Piece Of Commentary: Clive Tyldesly  Apparently managed to mention Manchester Utd. 36 times in the Czech Rep. Vs Greece Semi Final, with no Man U players in the game. We all know how this happens though. “A late substitution here, and I can think of another game with a late substitution…”   Worst Piece Of Punditry: Ian Wright  While Tony Adam’s opinions have now passed into legend (“The best way for us to win against Croatia is to drop Rooney…” “James can prove himself a legend in a penalty shootout”), Ian Wright has to be applauded for condemning Urs Meier’s decision against England while simultaneously refusing to watch a replay “because it’s too painful”.   Biggest Ponce Of A Player I Still Fucking Hate: Christiano Ronaldo  He might have been a bit handy at times, but in the final, he showed at least twice his ability to continue with the fucking step-overs when something like a side-footed pass or a blind toe-poke would have been a better option. Runner Up: David Beckham   =  Oh, and here's a picture that I reckon about two people will understand...

      Expect more stuff later today, because I have stuff to talk about, i.e.  *The Greeks and less successful nations *A really great film  Not to give too much away, but the second one involved a trip to the Showcase with the Wragg-Devlins and learning that Barney can say "donkey".  Apart from that, not much else happened this weekend. The Mrs and I went to the HMV Sale, and despite our best intentions, came away with 3 CDs and Smallville Series 1. We also made two trips to Debenhams, Leeds and White Rose, for the W-Ds' wedding present only to find that Debenhams are arse - we found what we wanted in Leeds, but they would let us buy it for delivery because the list was started at White Rose. White Rose was the worst fucking department store trip I've ever made - messy, understaffed, no fucking help. It took half an hour to print off the list and another half hour to tell us that they didn't have instore what the computer said they should have. Wankers.  =  I'm not an uncle yet. Jo thought she was going into labour on Friday, but it was a false alarm. It's tiring, all this waiting around.  =  I managed to shit myself up going into work today. I got a book for my course, basically The Complete Idiot's Guide To Teaching, and it's mentioned making a good first impression on the class, including how you stand or sit in front of them. Considering Titch has alerted me to the Useless Right Arm Syndrome, my most worrying fear of teaching has now turned to Looking Like A Goon. And don't tell me not to worry - I know what shits you lot were to teachers (not me, I was a fucking angel).  =   From Nasa. To quote Obiwan Kenobi -  urlLink "That's no moon..."

      Right, just done a quick search around here's the answer to why Korea has been denied the ability to see a superhero version of me and rantings about David Beckham's weight.  Last week, you may remember a Korean man, Kim Sun-il, was beheaded in Iraq. As Al Qaeda have been doing, they put a video and images online to show the world they aren't pssing about with idle threats. These videos and images, like with Nick Berg, Paul Johnson and Daniel Pearl become fascinating to internet ghouls and are popular downloads.  A S. Korean paper expressed their outrage that these videos can be downloaded. So, as a reactionary method, the Korean ISPs have blocked sites which included the videos and links. Of course, bloggers will often put links on their website, so blogspot adresses got blocked. There are also claims of political reasonings - like the pictures of planes full of US soldier coffins trying to be stopped in America, the goverment may believe the full shock of the execution would turn S. Korean opinion against their involvement in Iraq, especially since the video also shows Kim pleading in English that the Koreans withdraw from Iraq.  So, as such, Koreans and people living in Korea can't get on here...  ...unless they use a remote web proxy service like  urlLink Unipeak  to have pretty much free access and no blocking!  HA HA HA! FUCK YOU, KOREA! YOU'LL NEVER STOP ME!  =  In the mean time, how about a possible new,  urlLink Weebl  inspired title?

      Something weird's going on. I haven't been able to look at this here site for over a week now. I can post to it, through blogger.com, but this website, or any other with a xxx.blogspot.com address, I can't look at. The computer acts like it doesn't exist, and I've tried it on 4 different computers. Every other website works just fine, there's no error message on the blogger website, and A-MOL says he hasn't had a problem.  I don't get it. The only explanation I can think of is that the Korean ISP's have decided to block all blogspot sites. But why would they do that?

       urlLink Copy Of Manhunter Belonged To The Victim, Not The Murderer    Police involved in the Stefan Pakeerah murder case have revealed that the copy of Manhunt at the centre of a tabloid media frenzy last week was found in the possession of the victim, not the killer.  Newspapers and TV news channels gave significant coverage to the case last week, when the mother of the victim claimed that 17-year-old killer Warren LeBlanc had been "obsessed" with the ultra-violent Rockstar game.  However, according to a spokesperson for Leicestershire Constabulary, the police division which investigated the murder, the link is even more tenuous than was reported previously - with the game being found not in the room of the murderer, but of the victim.  "The video game was not found in Warren LeBlanc's room, it was found in Stefan Pakeerah's room," the spokesperson said today. "Leicestershire Constabulary stands by its response that police investigations did not uncover any connections to the video game, the motive for the incident was robbery."  While it's still entirely plausible that LeBlanc was obsessed with the game, as he and Pakeerah were friends, this new information does raise questions about how the 14-year-old Pakeerah was able to obtain a copy of the 18-rated game; and also about the conduct of the British media in reporting on the story.  The tabloid press, in particular the extremist right-wing Daily Mail newspaper, have already been heavily criticised for ignoring the police reports and prosecution statements which gave the motive for the murder as robbery, with LeBlanc killing his younger friend in order to pay back a drugs-related debt. Few tabloid stories made any mention of the drugs angle.  The news will also pour cold water on the intentions of American lawyer Jack Thompson, infamous for his chasing of cases relating to what he judges to be immoral media. Thompson apparently plans to bring a major lawsuit on behalf of the Pakeerah family against Rockstar; the revelation that the game belonged to their son, not to the killer, may well mean that this case is quietly dropped.   Nice one, fact-checking journalists!  =  Talking of crappy newspaper reporting:  urlLink  Daily Star Announce Incorrect BB Eviction on the Front Page    LONDON - The Daily Star committed a rather embarrassing blunder last night when the front page of its first edition reported that Shell had been evicted from the 'Big Brother' house when it was, in fact, Stuart.  The self-proclaimed "official Big Brother newspaper" ran the headline, "Bomb Shell rocks Big Bro" before revising today's later editions with "I've got Stu back again: Michelle joy as lover axed".  The 'Big Brother' result was announced live on Channel 4 at 10.40pm last night. Posh Shell had been the favourite to get the boot with odds of 50/1 and it is believed the tabloid got an early tip-off from the house that Shell was set to leave.  The reporter in question, "Mr Reality" Peter Dyke, was ridiculed on a number of radio stations this morning including Capital, Radio 1 and even on Radio 4, the bastion of sensible current affairs.  Chris Moyles, the breakfast show presenter on Radio 1, described Dyke as "rubbish".  However, the error pales in comparison with The New York Post's recent gaffe, which saw the newspaper incorrectly name Dick Gephardt as John Kerry's running mate for the November Presidential elections. The newspaper has since denied rumous that its owner, one Rupert Murdoch, was the source of that tip-off.   =  Have a pic:

      Since the start of last year, due to Mrs. A-MOL’s change in job, I’ve been catching the train from Dewsbury to York. This is a 45-minute trip direct or an hour with a change at Leeds. The length of trip has given me time to read the newspaper in detail instead of half-arsed flicking through. I have also read a great number of books in this time which I probably would not have bothered with; without forcing myself to get past the dry start to His Dark Materials one morning commute, I would not have finished this rather excellent series of books (Sidenote: Why do the Christian Right get pissed of with Harry Potter and not a group of books where The Church are the bad guys, God is physically killed and the world is saved by the love, in all senses of the word, between two 13 year olds?).   However, this is where the advantages of train journeys end. The service I use, run previously by Arriva and now by First Transport, is appalling. Punctuality is non-existent. However, what really pisses me off is their lack of ability to inform the customer of when their train is going to turn up. The standard tactic is to add two minutes to when the train is due, wait until that time has passed then add ANOTHER two minutes onto it. Twats. Trains are cancelled for no reason – my favourite being the train that disappeared. One minute it was on the board, the next gone and the staff at the train station had no idea what had happened, even after several phone calls.  Another problem is overcrowding. A train between Newcastle-York-Leeds-Manchester is probably going to be very popular on an evening, even more so on a Friday. Considering that on a moderate day, 3 carriages are needed to seat everyone comfortably, it is moronic the number of times that they provide two or even one carriage. This is their busiest line – you’d think they’d notice. It got so bad in a morning that I catch the 6:26 from Dewsbury, which gets me into the office a full hour before work starts, just so that I can sit down and relax instead of being crushed in the aisle.  There are other problems on trains that fuck me off that aren’t really the companies faults. The number of kids that are allowed to run around or JUST SCREAM CONSTANTLY THROUGH THE WHOLE FUCKING JOURNEY BECAUSE THEY WANT JUICE is frightening. There is also another class of people – insane twats. A few examples.    ·The man who sat next to me and started eating yoghurt. May not sound odd, but his method of eating was to eat it without a spoon, just bring the pot to his mouth and slurping it down as fast as possible.    ·A regular – a man who stands with a hunch, mouth agape, tongue hanging out, who starts snorting if you end up in front of him in the queue to get of the train likes he’s going to attack you.    ·The woman who started asking us why we were catching the train, and then declaring “I’ve gone to visit my husband. He’s in jail for murdering a girl” and then spent the rest of the journey detailing about how his case was a miscarriage of justice (It wasn’t, from what she was telling us.    ·A woman who read people’s newspapers from the aisle – just stood behind your seat and started reading. Unfortunately, she choose to do this on the day I was feeling really ill, tired, depressed and fucked off coming home from work (the suspected glandular fever period) and I threw the paper at her and told her she could fucking well buy it off me.  My days on the train probably aren’t finished, due to the fact I’m studying in Leeds, but 10-15 minutes is infinitely preferable to 45-60 mins.

      Looking for a good movie this autumn? Then get ready for  urlLink Team America: World Police .  From Trey Stone and Matt Parker, it looks like everything the Thunderbirds movie should have been. As I remember, the original idea came from The Day After Tomorrow. Apparently, Stone and Parker read the script and thought it was the worst script they had ever read, so they came up with the idea of filming there own version of TDAT with puppets and releasing it at the same time as the film.  The trailer looks pretty damned funny, and I’m up for seeing anything done by two people who made me laugh so hard when first hearing “Unclefucker”, I couldn’t breathe.  =  Talking of great films - The DVD of Shaun Of The Dead is out in September. The dVD includes:  # Missing Bits: extended bits, out-takes, The Man Who Would Be Shaun, Funky Pete, plot holes # Raw Meat: diaries from Simon, Lucy and Joe; Edgar and Simon's flip chart; SFX before and after; Make-up tests; Epic adventure featurette # TV Bits: T4 with Coldplay; Fun Dead; Trisha--Your Nine Lives Are Up; Trisha--I Married A Monster; Jeremy Thompson interview # Trails of the Dead: trailers # Zombie Gallery: photo gallery, 2000AD strip, poster designs  However, the extras which will probably make this one of the greatest DVDs of all time... 3 Commentaries!  #Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright #Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Dylan Moran, Kate Ashfield and Lucy Davis; Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton #The zombies  Fried Gold!
