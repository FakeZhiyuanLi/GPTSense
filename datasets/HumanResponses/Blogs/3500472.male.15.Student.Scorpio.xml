      hey, i have no life and iwant everyone to know...its 1210am on may 31st and theres no one online..i just lied, Bri is on, so she is cool like me and has no life. yay for us! i got this weird thing in my ear that bothers me and its annoying -therefore it bothers me- so, do people actually read these things? do they actually come into a blog (ha funny word again) and read about peoples lives for their entertainment? im sorry, but if youhave to read about my life just so that you can have fun, then im gonna go pray for you............*back* ya, God just said that he will help you all out. no, its alright if you read about my life for fun, but to tell you the truth, i have no home life. i sit on my "big butt" and listen to my music, play my bass, sing, work out occasionally, and lately work on that there video diary for Jess. if you have anymore questions about my home life, just ask Caitlin (chunker) cuz she knows all about my home life. do you ever get the sudden urge to go fishing? really? oh...cuz i just got one. i just got done watching indiana jones (lost crusades) and do youwanna know something? ive never seen an entire movie of indiana jones...i remember trying to watch them back in Texas (i lived there till i was 9) but i always had to go to bed right at the ending (when they actually started to get good)

      hey all, ive never used one of these things before, but i see everyone else using them aaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnd i decided to give in to this horrid peer pressure...tsk tsk tsk so anyways, im gonna be giving all y'all updates of my life and whats goin on in it. so far i have a couple things goin on so im gonna get those off my chest rot hurr rot nurr (right here right now in thug lingo) numero uno of thins to get off my chest is graduation...k, for all you people who hacked into this website thinking it was some sort of kinky website and dont know who i am, im gonna tell you my story about graduation. graduation is in 6 days. "big deal" your saying, "your supposed to look forward to graduation" WELL NOT THIS YEAR MY DEAR FRIENDS! k, i met this awesome girl who is a senior this school year and she is...unbelievable...you dont even know. well as i was saying shes a senior and im a freshman, and we have had almost 5 and a half months together where we have been going out, and i am not ready at all for her to leave. i love her a lot and im going to miss her so much, its going to suck. so, im trying to make the best of it by doing a couple of things for her graduation present, ive been making her a video diary ffor the last 2 months and im making her a t-shirt with pics of us all over it and if i can im going to buy her a bunch of gerbera daisies cuz they are her favorite flowers in the world (not carnations)but i have to wait and see how much money im gonna have left over, i should have enough though...anyways im really going to miss her. another thing thats going on is that this guy at my school (zac morris) is giving me the hookups by trying to get me a job at the storm stadium behind the scoreboard wall and ill be putting up the score and stuff, so be sure (if i get the job) that whenever you see a number being put on the board, be sure to scream GO BRIAN! that way ill feel special once again. ummm lets see...oh ya, im going to vegas a couple weeks after graduation and i dont want to go cuz my brother is gonna be working so he cant go, so im gonna have to go with my 9 year old sister and my parents...what a wild and crazy time...not...but im not looking forward to that cuz its gonna bring back memories from exaltation choir (cuz we went there for tour choir this year and Jessica ((my gf)) was on that tour with me) so yup, thats pretty much all the major things thats going on at the moment. so ill type out another blogororium later (blog is a funny word) alright check ya later -chunky watson

      yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead yesterday is a promise that you've broken don't close your eyes, don't close your eyes this is your life and today is all you've got now yeah, and today is all you'll ever have don't close your eyes don't close your eyes  this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it would be when the world was younger and you had everything to lose  yesterday is a kid in the corner yesterday is dead and over  this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it would be when the world was younger and you had everything to lose  don't close your eyes don't close your eyes don't close your eyes don't close your eyes  this is your life are you who you want to be this is your life are you who you want to be  this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, is it everything you dreamed it would be when the world was younger and you had everything to lose  and you had everything to lose   i dunno about you, but this song has made me realize that things in this life are so insignificant, we take advantage of the dumbest things. i am guilty when i say this, but we sit around bored out of our minds when this is our one and only life on earth. why not actually do something with it? we only have one chance here together, thats why i am so bothered when people try to get into little stupid tiny things that shouldnt even be brought up and other useless things like that because they are wasting part of their lives away on something that shouldnt even be happening, so next time your sitting on the couch doing nothing, remember that you r not gonna be here forever, and neither are your friends and family, so go out, have fun with your life, spend time with the people you love, dont waste away with one of the greatest earthly possessions that God has given you.

      yeah, it has been awhile since i wrote in this thingy, my computer has been really stupid and its going extremely slow, and the internet keeps dying on us...very frustrating. anyways, lastnight, i saw troy, and then i movie hopped and saw dodgeball which was pretty funny (if you like the stupid kind of humor)im such a loser, no one loves me, i was supposed to go to the movies with like 6 or 7 other sophmores and then that plan got shot down so i called a couple of my friends from temecula, but they were at dance, and then out of desperation, i called earl, who was at his dads house in fallbrook and wouldnt have been able to make it to the theater in time...anyways, my interview at tillys went very well, adn they wanna have the store manager interview me tomorrow, so hopefully i can get that job. umm ya...VBS is ok...my mom signed me up without knowing, so i was oh so very extremely saddened by that. ya...ummm i went to my dads company picnic thingy awhile ago, that was pretty boring, he even admitted that it was really boring. well, i think thats all the excitement that has happened in my life since the last time i wrote in this so im gonna go

      you should all be proud of me. i went over to a guys house this week (just to give him a chance to redeem himself)and know what he does? he offers me to go outside and smoke pot with him...MUY FURIOSO MR. ANONYMOUS!!!! so, i said no to the crap that he offered, and then i just kinda pretended that he never offered it to me and forgot about it until i left...makes me sad. and he kept asking me to smoke it too, which just goes to tell you that smoking pot doesnt only make you stupid, it makes you addicted very easily. so, to all who read this (yes, all 3 of you) i say to you,"JUST SAY NO, OR YOU ARE A HOMO!" sorry about the whole homo  part of it, if you are in anyway offended, then i am deeply sorry and i will pray for you, but it just sounds like a catchy saying. ya, well im just glad im home and away from that crap. so anyways! i was going upstairs to do something i ferget what and all the lights were out cuz it was around 1130 and i didnt see my monster bass amp in the middle of the floor (obviously cuz the lights were out) and i bashed the side of my shin into the amp and i fell on the ground and couldnt stand on my lieg for awhile and my toes started going numb...im such a mess...think i can borrow someones body while they have to live with mine? thank you for offering. anyways its midnight and i havnt been able to sleep at all for the past 2 or 3 days, so im gonna go. its fracking hot in this house... bye

      hey all, i just got back from the blood sucking place. honestly, it wsnt as bad as the horror stories that people were telling me about, like how it would take a few hours or so, and that the needle hurts soooooo much and junk. well, the needle did kinda hurt, but it went away eventually, and it took like 2 or 3 min. it was kind of cool though cuz the lady wrapped a rubberband thing around my arm so all  my veins were popping out like crazy...and when the blood was going into the vile, it looked kinda neat-o, but it was weird thinking that that was all coming out of me...weird, but once again, it look neat-o. so ya, all you people reading this have either fainted aready or are muy furioso that im actually writing aboot this and your saying, "EW, EW, EW, BRIAN-A!" BUT OH WELL..wow caps were on...ya, so anyways. i had to take a (uh oh, gross word coming up) URINE test and stuff to check for ketones, and i had "trace 5" wich means that i have no body fat and my body IS eating away at my muscles as we speak. know what that means? it means i have to stop being lazy (crap!) and i have to start working out again...ugh. anyways im really hungry havnt eaten anything in over 12 hours. bye

SOOOOOOOO i didnt see it today...im not much of a "go tot he movies by yourself" type of person, its just not as fun, cuz you cant make fun of the people in the movies by yourself. well, you can, but its not as funny. oh well...maybe next time? hopefully. theres a lot of people on my block who are the same age as me...i wanna meet some of them, but im not good at "first time meeting thingies" it would be easier if i had someone else to go up to them with me or if i was really hyper. ive been wanting to meet temecula people since i moved out here, but im not good at that stuff...oh well, atleast i have friends as it is. im talking to kyle M. (not P.) hes a funny/cool guy. man im bored...ive been checking the computer on and off all day to see if Caitlin was on, but she hasnt been on =( neither has ashten, but i just found out that shes babysitting until 8 sooooooo im stuck here with kyle...jk hes cool. ya well im gonna get going ok?

Chunk- to you i will my axe, my dancing abilities, the triple N.B., my guitar playing abilities, and my cool curly hair  Chunker- to you i will my bass playing abilities, awesome athletic abilities (heehee like i have tons of it...) my ability to attract men =), and my raunchiness  Jesus- my whole life  Kryt- waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaghn, and my elvis lip   and then i also will my upper body to you people (yes, you must split up the days in which you take posession of it) so that when you are lonely or in need of a hug, i will always be there; *with lifeless arms wide open, under the sunlight, welcometo this place ill show you everything. with lifeless arms wide open* i will put a good word in for you to the creator of all, but i feel that that isnt completely necessary figuring i know you are already strong believers. i will truly miss you all, *and at my funeral i will sing....* no,ummm ya...i will have my bass placed nextto my casket so that chunk and Chunker may kiss it as they planned to but never go to...anyways, now that i have my nearly expectant death all planned out, let us change the subject  .....so, how about them padres? jk doesnt it kind of feel like school is still going on? kind of like were on a weekend thingy? well it is the weekend, but i keep thinking that in 2 days im gonna wake up and get ready for school and see all of my friends again. makes me sad. i miss all of my friends...DID YOU HEAR THAT?

      hey there, school is out, i still cant believe it...im used to the whole grade school thing where you clean out your desk and then have a class party at the end of the year, but high school is so much more different...school starts, it goes along, you have great times with great friends, and then the next day they are gone, either at home, or they really are gone. its so abrupt...graduation ended about 9.5 hours ago, and im just now realizing that school is out. now, most of you reading this are probably saying, "your crazy Brian for missing school and your friends and junk" but its true...i do miss all of that. (just not math or miss raisors science class...blah...) anyways, i want to say thanks to caitlin for letting me talk to her...and we all know i thank Jess...and thanks to all of my other great friends that ive made throughout the school year. please keep in touch and junk ok? thanks bye

      hey all its june 5th...know what that means? thats right. graduation. anyways, im gonna take you back to yesterday (for all of you who are mathmatically chellenged,  5-1=4 therefore, yesterday was june 4th) anywhoways! ya, last night was the pops concert, it was my first one ever and it was pretty fun for me. but i was running around like an idiot trying to get things ready cuz i had to play either 3 or 4 songs on bass and then i had to get all dressed up for our songs and junk (you know, putting on a poncho and hat is a lot of work for me) and then the main event of the night (for me) was the song that i sang and that ian played on guitar, i was supposed to play bass but i thought my amp was broken cuz it was buzzing really loud...turned out it was unplugged...oh well. anyways, i had caitlin take pics and i had my parents video tape it onto jessicas video diary thingy and i had Jess stand next to the stage then i sat on a stool and sang the song up until the last verse when i got up and took the mic and went over to her and gave her the shirt i made her (by the way i was wearing the shirt too cuz i made one for me and one for her) and i started singing and people were awwwwwwwwwwwwing and then her eyes started watering and then it was over and everyone was screaming and clapping and then we hugged and life was great once again. and then today for graduation i thought i wouldve cried or something of that sort, but i didnt. but i did fight the tears when she got her diploma. umm...the singing was good, once again the bass section didnt know our parts for a lil part of the song, but i dont care..i mean its graduation, i wasnt really focused on my singing. also, i had to say good-bye to jamie mandy benson moore (there is no "Y" in her first name) and i had to say good-bye to michelle...gonna miss those two peoples...well, im gonna go get ready for Jess's graduation party so ill do this some other time.  CONGRATS JESSICA!!!!!!!!!!! IM PROUD OF YOU!!!

      hey people. i had carls Jr for din idn. the more i think about it, the more im convinced that that place isnt that great...it was $20.00 for 4 people to eat there tonight.."CRAZY TALK!" you might be saying...well its true my friends. sad but true. ANYWHOWAYS!!!!  today after school ian and i practiced "times like these" for the popsconcert with the mics and everything, and it sucked so bad....my bass was completely out of tune and ians strumming was kind of off so i kept screwing up on when to come in and stuff, but besides all that, people said my voice was great. also, i just got done with Jessicas graduation shirt. i made one for myself to (cuz im selfish like that =P) so im going to wear that for my song, and maybe do somehting else...no one knows but me...and God...yup, well im not ashamed when i say this, but i broke down this morning. i was talking with caitlin and she told me some good news about her and Dan, ad then she asked whats on my mind and so i told her some of the things that i feel about graduation and Jessica leaving and stuff, and right after i said "i can see it in her that she wants to leave but i dont want her togo at al." i broke down...thanks for comforting me cait-e-poo. but. i think i needed a break down like that, cuz ive been holding it in for way to long. my mommy said im a romantic...yay...also, i didnt get to finish my math exam cuz my choir director pulled me and the other bass aside so we could practice and she kept us for like 15 minutes after the bell rang so i was late to the exam and i had 17 problems left...there were only 66 problems on the exam, and it was really hard too, soi most likely failed that exam (again) yup, well thats all the excitement in my life for today, so ill do this some other time. im gonna go work on her video diary thingy soon. ok? bye all

        ya, at first i didnt know who that was who posted a comment under my last updated thinger, but then i realized thurr is only 1 person i know of who says "goshlee" and that would be amy...and caitlin or Jessica, i know you were thinking about posting a comment using the word "goshlee"...but ya, anyways, today was a good day, it was just me dad and ian for most of the day, and then dad and i went to go see shrek 2 cuz he hadnt seen it yet, but it wasnt showing, so we went to go see i robot. well we got thurr and it was hot as heck (not literally) and it turned out the AC was broken in only that theater...oh well, we got a free movie ticket voucher thinger out of it, but we dont need it at the moment because ian can get us in for free, so im going to save it for when he leaves. yesterday was awesome. my dad and bro were working all day, and my mom and sis were at shannons dance rehearsal, so i was home alone for 5 hours. so i took the stereo outside and i blared my story of the year cd while swimming, and then i went inside and played bass for an hour and a half or so, and then i got bored so i attempted to make chocolate chip cookies...oh boy...ya, well these things are like frackin sponges, they fill you up so quickly...ya, so if i offer chocolate chip cookies to you, dont accept it. ya, so that was a lot of fun...END

       wow, today was actually kinda busy for me...i got my hair cut, which makes me look way older, like waaayyyyyyy older, the lady cutting my hair kept saying i have a very nice jaw bone structure, then she kept saying it is very GQ....what does "GQ" mean!??!?!?! i am so not down with todays lingo.... and then i got the story of the year cd which is very awesome, i highly recommend it...very good, thhhheeeeeeeeeeen i went to go see king arthur... oh my goshness...keira knightley is so frackin hot...and know what else??!?! i thought she was in her 20's or so, NOPE! shes 18....18!!!!! ITS CRAZY! so shes on my list of people to marry. and then i got a new cool polo shirt from anchor blue (i like polo shirts now and i dunno why...theyre purtty comfy though) annnnnd i go 5 "A shirts" i&nbsp;have to call them that cuz my mommy doesnt like the term "wife beaters" but i can understand that, cuz that's kind of a harsh name (especially for a shirt). so ya, today was a pretty good day... got a&nbsp;hair cut, saw my future wives, got&nbsp;a new cd, and i got new shirts...oh there was a part in king arthur that almost made me cry. cuz KIERA's fingers were broken so they had to break them back into place...and we all know how much i HATE&nbsp; it when people do things to their toes and fingers.... im&nbsp;cringing right now from the sound of that part in the movie...ITS SOOOO GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;

      thats right, i almost died (again) today. i got electricuted. it hurt like a freaking monkey eating a ladybug. how did i so nearly come to the grave you may be asking? well ill tell you my story. i had to go to st stephens to practice for some songs for church tomorrow, and in order to do so, i needed to get my bass and amp. weeeellll as we all know the amp needs to be plugged into something right? well, this amp, is no little amp, its a fracking 100watt amp...so i go to pull the thinger out of the outlet and my finger slipped and touched one of the prongs when it was still have way plugged in, and thats when it hit me...owchies...the pain...i was on my knees when i was pulling it out, and it hit me so hard it pushed me back and i wound up laying on the floor screaming owwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!! but of course no one heard me cuz my music was too loud. it was really weird though cuz its like i couldnt let go of the prong thingy, and it felt like it was vibrating so quickly that it was burning. ya. so it went through my middle and ring finger and into my wrist and all the way up to my elbow...when i finally got up off the floor i couldnt feel my arm at all, and i was breathing really funnilly so i told ian cuz he was the first one i saw, and he told me to go  to dad so i did, and he explained how it all worked out (cuz he makes phones and works with this stuff at the time) and then my mom found out and she explained the weird breathing, she said that it couldve made my heart skip a beat or 2 so it threw off my breathing pattern or something. so ya, i had a completely numb arm for a good 30-45 minutes. its not fun people...it hurts...baaaaaaaaad. like a sheep. well thats all the excitement for one day  P.S. happy 18th bday Jessica!

      hey people, its july 1st or the 1st of july, maybe even thefirst day of july, 7/1/04 do you understand now? how about now? good. i hate that guy and his silly little celly-o-phone. he should be slapped. do youthink hes annoyed with hisself for saying that sooo many times, and seeing himself say it on TV all the time? if i were him, i would go insane. i tried watching wild boyz with my mommy last night (its a show on MTV not a hoochie show...just incase you were wondering what is was Jessica) and she was laughing soooo hard, i dont think ive ever heard her laugh so hard, but they said a few bad words here and thurr so we had to turn it...made me sd cuz it was purty sillarious. i had a weird dream last night, but i dont think ill write it out in hurr. oh well, ill leave you guessing as to what it is. anywhoways, these last 2 days have been really boring for me, all i did was sit on my fat butt and gain 57 lbs. not really, i probably lost that much weight just by sitting. *siiiiiiigggggggggggh* caitlin, sorry i but i threw away the letter, i decided not to send it. jk i didnt throw it away, i waded it up and put it in my secret hidding place forever. well, thats about all the nonsense junk i have for you all today. byebye

      thats right, caytie has cool hair, it is brown and cool (not crappy)...anyways, tonight was awesome cuz i got to see a good/muy coolio friend of mine...thats right...caytie. and i havnt seen her in a very looooooooooooooooooooong time. we saw "the village" and stuff. then we went into the elevator thing and we stood there for a couple minutes and it was not moving...turned out i forgot to press the button that said "1" on it or something like that. but it was a cool elevator cuz it had not 1, but 2 doors!!!!! i ve never seen anything like it before!!!! i was so excited! i ate skittles. ya, after the movie ended at 9 we waited for my mother to pick me up, but she didnt come so i called and she thought it ended at 920...silly mother...and then i got really fuzzy and started feeling numb in my face, arms, legs stomach, and later on my tongue. and i was scurred. then i ate skittles and felt better. so im thinking my blood sugar was low, which is weird because last time i was tested, i wasnt diabetic, so i dunno whats up with me...probably my body being retarded again...DONE  caytie, lets not wait a whole year before we see each other again...stay cool (just like your hair)
