      So i just plaied madden 2005 for the first time on xbox live. i lost 21-7. i was the phildelphia eagles and i plaied against the carolina panthers.  to be honest i am not as good at madden as i used to be. i have too many video games now and it dialoots my video game skill. so be it. it is more fun be an experienced video game users.  after losing i was messing around with what madden on live had to offer and i noticed that there was a group "rushing attack." so i checked it out; it is the rushing attack mini camp vs. another person. lots of fun. you have 1 minute on offense and then one minute on defense. like most games who ever has the most points wins. after you play someone you can chose to re-match or no. i plaied about 10 games with 3 different people and i think i was 7-3ish. but afterwards i checked out my profile and it said i handt palied a game. =(. not sure why but, oh well.  Corey, the guy driving the mini (below) is coming over right now and i am going to whoop up on him in some nfl street.  Ea added a lot of defense pre-span controls to madden which i am a big fan of.  i think i might be going to the redskins game tom which should be fun. that is if hurrcanes dont come and kill us.  godspeed

       it is kinda funny.  i was looking for houses in dc today with my pops.  Some we wanted to go look at and others we just walked by.  it is weird how i liked a house (condo, or townhouse) that was 450 more than one offered for 750.  it just doesnt make sense.  i wonder if those being sold for 750 are ever going to sell.      i guess what i am looking for and what a fmaily is looking for might be different but even then 300 is a lot of money.  and the location's are pretty similar so i am confused.      I am very happy the USA basketball team lost today in the olympics.  just goes to show just because you can drunk a ball doesnt mean you are good at basketball.
