      i am leaving for chicago tomorrow at 8am. my parents are crazy about being everywhere early, especially when flights are concerned, so we are leaving for providence (which is about a 45 minute drive...) at 5:45 am. i know you are supposed to get to airports early but my god. anyway, connecticut is boring and i am looking forward to moving on. a quick recap of my time here:  yesterday (tuesday): hung out all day in the hammock on the back porch. did some laundry. started reading "go figure (va savoir)". its a book by a quebec author about a guy who is renovating a house in the country while his wife is travelling around europe with his former mistress (or girlfriend...im not sure). so far so good. my mom made a big dinner (the only one while i was home) of roast chicken and potatos and whatnot. my mom sure makes a mean gravy. at night went to see the killers at the call in providence. the show was supposedly sold out in advance but i drove up anyway hoping to buy a ticket off of someone. mapquested directions as i had never been then. the directions turn out to be totally wrong and i end up completely lost in downtown providence. providence is not layed out in blocks and i should also mention that they do that thing where the same street will change names. yeah thats annoying. anyway i ask a coupld of people if they know where the call is or if they've heard of elbow street (the street on which its allegedly located...) and everyone looks at me like im insane. anyway i drive around for a bit and ask a random woman on the corner if she knows where it is and she starts to give me directions, but its kinda complicated and then the light changes and people start honking, so shes all like im going that way, i swear im not a serial killer, can i get in i'll just show you where it is. she turns out to be super nice and had heard about the show on the radio. we get a little bit lost because she walks everywhere and streets are one way and stuff but anyway we find it eventually. there is even parking right across the street. she was on her way to another nearby bar to watch the red sox kick the crap out of toronto (go sox), so i told her that i would come join her if i couldnt get a ticket. turns out there were tickets at the door. it was only 6 bucks and the place wasnt even packed. the club was pretty small for them too, probably about 2-300 capacity. the opening band was the everyones from australia. poppy. not bad. picked up a free sampler, havent checked it out yet. the killers take super long to set up. the finally get on and only play for like half an hour plus a 2 song encore. kinda short but i guess they only have one album. they were pretty good live. not much to look at but they played great and the drummer rocked out like hell. they didnt play the only non-single that i really really like a lot (track 5, all the things i've done) until the last song of the encore and i couldnt remember the name to yell for it and i was sure they werent gonna play it, but they did. close one.  monday: did pretty much nothing. hung out for a bit at  urlLink the mystic disc . i worked there a bit years ago, before i moved to montreal. very solid little store with lots of good vinyl. very high fidelity. talked some baseball with rich. later went for a drink with my dad at  urlLink margaritas , this super cheesy mexican restaurant in mystic. i was tempted to get a burrito, but i am holding out for california, or at least chicago. did have some good fried ice cream as well as my new favorite mexican beer  urlLink modelo especial .  sunday: played whiffleball. my friend rich freitas (of the mystic disc as well as the band  urlLink low beam ) organizes a weekly game of whiffleball in noank. they take is pretty seriously and there is a  urlLink website  with stats and everything. its pretty hardcore, check it out. i hit one out in my first at bat, and also had a bunch of singles and a couple walks. i also struck out had a sac fly and fell down while running from first to second. go me. after the game i brought home a bbq chicken pizza from  urlLink mystic pizza  (amazing...will someone please bring real pizza to montreal?) and watched the extended version of almost famous with my mom. god i love that movie.  saturday: drove to new haven and took  urlLink metro north  to grand central. went to  urlLink MOMA at PS1  in long island city, queens to see  urlLink the ryan mcginley show . it kinda sucked. had to pay 8 bucks instead of the usual 2 because there was some sorta benefit beach party going on with djs and stuff, which meant it was really crowded and i got to look at the art with techno/dance music thumping away outside. after that i busted it over to randalls island (aka worst place on earth) for  urlLink little steven's underground garage fest . scored a ticket from a dude outside the 125th st subway in harlem for 20 bucks, saving 5 off the door price. booyah. met up with jasamine and lisa at the show. got free iced lattes courtesy of dunkin donuts. caught some of the raveonettes, and all of the pretty things, new york dolls, strokes and iggy and the stooges. strokes and stooges were both amazing. 20 bucks very well spent and the hurricane held off until the show was pretty much over. waited forever with like 5000 people for the bus back to manhattan and busted it over to  urlLink north six  in willamsburg for  urlLink matt pond pa . caught most of their set. wow. really. great band. i had only ever heard like one or two tracks but live they totally blew me away. also the cellist/keyboard player was not unattractive at all. cait smith was there with a couple of her friends, so all took the subway back to manhattan to catch our respective last trains. grabbed a hot dog and a pretzel outside of grand central. why do we not have street vendors in montreal??? WHY???  friday: i think i did nothing. may have hung out in downtown mystic at the disc and/or the green marble (a cafe that i spent most of ages 15-18 hanging out at/around). came home, went on the internet a lot.  thursday: woke up early and went to boston with my dad. caught the red sox-devil rays day game at fenway. wow. scalpers were asking 60 bucks US for bleacher seats. baseball in boston is insane. we missed the first inning and a half, but finally found a guy (not a scalper) with 2 extras who sold them to us for face value (45 apiece). scizzore. sweet seats too. first level 11th row granstands just on the first base side of home (still behind the net). pedro threw a gem. 10 Ks, 6 hits, no walks, complete game. fenway is amazing. the seat are super small tho. on a side note, does noone work in boston? it was one in the afternoon on a thursday and there was not an empty seat in the stadium. after the game we hit up  urlLink newbury comics  on newbury and i picked up the killers album as well as the first  urlLink planes mistaken for stars  EP which was stolen from me years ago. PMFS are like crusty grind now or something, but their first EP is melodic and i like it a lot. you can hear a couple of songs  urlLink here . just scroll all the way down. i recommend "copper and stars". then we went to newport RI where my dads band (dave howard and the high rollers...cant find the site URL...will get back to you on that...) was playing at the  urlLink blues cafe . the band was very decent. for those of you who dont know, my dad is a hawt piano/organ player. the blues cafe weirdly enough is where i was introduced to modelo especial. anyway, newport is like this ritzy seaside sorta town where they used to hold the americas cup races every four years for like a hundred years until australia or new zealand or whatever won it and took it down there sometime in the 80s. its a big sailing place. rich people from new york used to summer there and there are all these crazy huge manions everwhere that are referred to as "cottages". gotta love old money. anyway i found the one record store in town and because i guess nobody in newport listens to indie rock i found a bunch of sweet promos in the used section for under 5 bucks (constantines, solea, sam roberts, cave in, pretty girls make graves, saddle creek 50 comp, ryan adams, etc....10 cds for 30 bucks). im broke tho so i might sell a bunch of them to  urlLink amoeba  in san francisco. i should be able to make a profit on some of them. i forget the name of the store, but its right in the main part of town by the water. when in newport check it out.  wednesday: hung out in downtown mystic. went to get an iced coffee at bess eaton (a southern new england donut chain...) only to find out that bess eaton had gone bankrupt and been bought by TIM HORTONS. how weird is that? tim hortons is now all over new england. at least they have iced coffee here. hung out that night with my friend mallory and drank some busch lite in cans. god bless america. mallory had gotten trashed the previous night and tried to make herself falafel while drunk only to end up severely burning her arm and hand with hot oil, so i spent most of the night watching her drain blisters on her arm and bandage it up. sweet. she did however get prescibed vicodin for the pain. her roomates cat just had kittens so there were like 7 little insane but very cute cats running all over the place doing insane things that i cant remember. it was entertaining at the time. like periodically they would get their claws stuck on this curtain thing that was serving as a door and they would just sorta swing back and forth on it until they freed themselves. for those keeping score at home mallory was party to the "incident" which led to nathan leaving full count mid tour last summer. she is also a very decent singer/songwriter. she played me a couple of songs and i was impressed. sorta cat powerish. she also works at the green marble.   a note on the jew bus: i took the jewish bus from new york to montreal monday night/tuesday morning. what an experience. i highly recommend it if at all possible. i called up to reserve my spot and the guy cross examined me about my jewishness, all asking what synagogue i belonged to and stuff. anyway i made it up saying i belonged to a temple beth-israel in connecticut. that seemed to satisfy him. anyway i googled it and it turns out there is actaully a  urlLink temple beth israel in hartford  and it is the largest reform congregation in connecticut or something. sweet. go me. anyway, the bus was insane. it was totally full and everyone was speaking yiddish. YIDDISH! who speaks yiddish?? i was also the only male on the bus without a kippah. women and men had to sit separately (women in the back...) and this one girl who i guess was not super religious tried to get on in a tank top and the woman yelled at her to cover up and put on a sweatshirt. we stopped in this weird little village called kiryas joel about an hour outside of new york that was all hasidic jews. who knew? me and one other guy got off at penn station in manhattan and everyone else was going either to this village or to brooklyn. weird.  anyway....its 3 am and i gotta be up at like 5:15 so ima hit the sack...i will update from chicago...

      i am at my parents house in mystic (well technically ledyard...which is pronounced ledge-urd for those of you keeping score at home...). i took the jewish bus from a random corner on the border between outremont and tmr last night at 10 and got into penn station around 6 this morning. more about the bus ride later. chilled out at penn for an hour, had a krispy kreme donut and 15 minutes later a salt bagel. purchased about 30 seconds away from each other. god bless america. took amtrak from penn to mystic, got here just before 10, slept all day, had dinner with mom and dad, drove into town, saw justyn at the  urlLink bookstore , got an iced coffee (god bless american) at the green marble, saw some of the downtown kids, went for a couple of drinks after justyn got off work at john's place, which is a sweet divey bar in mystic. she is leaving tomorrow but im glad i got to see her. there seems to be nobody around, so it's probably gonna be me vs. the townies for the rest of this week. i am so out of it. must sleep.
