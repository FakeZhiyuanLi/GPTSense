       The Niagara Falls Aviary is an incredible place to visit. Although it has an appearance of a new building, the history buried deep in its core is quite fascinating. The Niagara Falls Aviary is located on River Road to the North side of the Rainbow Bridge. The  building was constructed in 1908 by the Spirella Corset Company where they manufactured corsets. It is four stories high and is constructed of concrete.When the company was at its peek manufacturing period it would have employed approximately 250 women. By 1958, troubled times had hit the company and they only had about 30 workers when they decided to move the company to a smaller facility on Lewis Avenue.The building itself was purchased in 1999 by a Niagara-on-the-Lake residents Larry & Marilyn Vann.  Larry had been in the advertising business for a number of years. They invested over 15 million dollars into the renovations of the building. We had been in this building after Larry had purchased it and before the renovations took place. It certainly needed a lot of work. A new addition was added to the south side of the building which would become an open concept observation area amidst free flight birds and pathways and water falls of all sorts.To view more information and history about the build and the company, visit our web site at  urlLink Adventures Niagara  and select NIAGARA ATTRACTIONS and then select THe Niagara Falls Aviary.

        We decided to hike down into the Glen at the Niagara Glen Nature Reserve today. Although we have been there a few times, we take a different path each time we return. This was no exception. We had walked on the westerly path which takes up towards the hydro generation plant. There was plenty of folk there walking the paths and a few sitting on the banks by the river watching the jet boats go up through from Niagara-on-the-Lake. The foliage has grown and there is plenty of plant life to view. The picture we have included is of one of the Jet Boats making their tour through the river which we viewed from the top of the Glen. This is an excellent place to go for a hike or if you just want to have a picnic there is a picnic are there as well.

        &nbsp;This is a picture of the entrance to the Blue Ghost Tunnel which is located near the G.M. plant and the Old Third Welland Canal. This is a 700 foot long tunnel that goes under the third Welland Canal. The Tunnel was built by the Grand Trunk/Great Western Railway in the mid 1800's. It was put out of service in the early 1900's when the railway built a double track line that went over the Welland Canal via a steam powered swing bridge. The tunnel is abandoned and is frequently visited by paranormal researchers and others. Some have the belief that the tunnel is haunted&nbsp;but the source of the haunting is in question. Some believe it is a railway accident, some believe it's from the Cemetery that was near by, others believe there was a murder in there and so on. Visit my web site for more information.

       Living in the Niagara region has been enlightening to say the least. There are so many places to explore and things to see. This has encouraged me to explore all points of the region and to build a web site that shows these places.

        Located off of Warner Road, The Screaming Tunnel is one of Niagara's most enduring legends. The Screaming Tunnel is a tunnel built of rough-cut stone that passes under the double track Canadian National Railway lines that is still in use today. The tracks run from Niagara Falls west through St. Catharines. It is said that this tunnel was built in the early 1900's just before the beginning of the First World War by the Grand Trunk Railway which at one time was the Great Western Railway.   There are a couple of reasons why this location would be of interest to some people. First the Canadian Movie Director David Cronenberg, around 1982 had used this location as a setting for a brutal murder in the horror film "The Dead Zone".  Another reason is that this Tunnel is apparently haunted by the spirit of a young girl who had died in or near the Tunnel. We have found several variations to the legend of the death of the young girl.  All these stories allege that if you stand in the middle of the dark tunnel at midnight and light a match, the flame will go out and a girls screams will be heard.  There is a lot more to this legend and about the tunnel. Read more about it on our web site at  urlLink Adventures Niagara &nbsp;and click on UNUSUAL LOCATIONS and then The Screaming Tunnel.
