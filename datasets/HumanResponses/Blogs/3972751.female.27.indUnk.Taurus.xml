      I cruised down the New England roads trying to light up the road through my purple rimmed plastic eye glasses.&nbsp; Surely I need a new prescription?&nbsp; It's dark out and what I can see through the headlights are trees arching over the winding road.&nbsp; When cars whip around the curves from the other direction (those damn locals), I feel blinded and impotent, positive I'm going to drive right into the next goat, but miraculously my tires and I stick to the black top and make our way into the happening part of town.   I cruise right by that part of town out&nbsp;into some roads.&nbsp; These roads are less wild country and more tame suburb, so I feel&nbsp;more comfortable snaking along trying to follow my map.&nbsp; Eventually the street sign&nbsp;emerges and then there's a small road on a barely visible corner.&nbsp; That was the trick Teddy had told me about to find their house.&nbsp; The other useful tip was that the address and the number on the mailbox outside the house were distinct.&nbsp; I turned my car off and&nbsp;looked&nbsp;warily at the 4 inch Gucci pumps I'd brought along to wear.&nbsp; I pushed them aside, donned flat black flip flops and was just finishing&nbsp;reapplying my lipstick when I saw Teddy ambling down the front walk.&nbsp;   "Hi!"&nbsp; I said, immediately&nbsp;glad I'd opted for flip flops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Teddy&nbsp;was wearing a&nbsp;blue polo shirt and khaki shorts (the same blue polo shirt he'd been wearing the last two times I'd seen him?&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder.)&nbsp; Teddy and I hugged.   "Hey, good to see you.&nbsp; Did you see any cabs?&nbsp; We thought we saw two pairs of&nbsp;head lights."&nbsp; I immediately felt self-conscious for taking time to exit my car, and followed him toward the house.   "Oh, Teddy friend!"&nbsp; A young man walked out of the house and exclaimed when catching sight of me.   "Lizzy, this is Conan."&nbsp; The man did have a bit of a resemblance to the talk show host, but finer featured and not as convincing of a caricature.   "This is going to be overwhelming, so don't worry if you don't remember people's names -- I don't even know them all."&nbsp; Teddy and I climbed a flight of stairs into a kitchen.&nbsp; There was a disconnect between the lovingly fashioned country oceanside decor and the group of rowdy adults drinking beer from plastic red and blue cups.&nbsp;   "Do you need a drink?"&nbsp; I merely nodded.&nbsp; Another nameless man handed us three clean cups and Teddy commandeered a third to take a shot of jagermeister.&nbsp;   We threw back our liquor and then scrambled as the crowd descended down the stairs and into the first massive van cab.&nbsp; The second cab rolled up alongside and I climbed in.&nbsp; Teddy came and sat beside me.&nbsp; I was pretty sure I smelled puke, but kept that thought to myself.   We were waiting in line to enter into the bar.&nbsp; It was Nantucket and it was a typical island dive bar, but on the fourth of July, it might as well have been members only access.&nbsp; I felt small, and couldn't stop standing on my tip toes.&nbsp; Regardless, I was not really clearing Teddy's shoulder.&nbsp;   We went into the bar toward the back and Teddy bought us drinks.&nbsp; He said that's where the crowd usually went to gather.&nbsp; Because no one came back there, we rejoined them toward the front of the bar.&nbsp; We had jello shots.&nbsp; They were very tasty.&nbsp; Everyone picked red.   We were all standing around.&nbsp; Teddy had given me over to Mark to entertain while he used the restroom.  "So, how many&nbsp;single guys are there?&nbsp; There's me."&nbsp; I pricked up my ear attentively, but didn't register whether Teddy meant his girlfriend wasn't around or whether she was no longer his girlfriend.&nbsp; While they determined the ratio of couples and single folks, I unzipped my terry cloth hooded sweatshirt and tied it around my waist.  Teddy turned back toward me and we started talking about the halcyon days of undergrad.&nbsp; And in the midst of school talk, we discussed how we first met.  I knew a guy, Dan, who was interested in me.&nbsp; He called me and would ask what I was doing.&nbsp; Dan had a job at one of the local bars.&nbsp; It was a very vanilla bar in every sense of the word, and because it catered mostly to jocks and doe-eyed vapid chick sophomores, I usually steered clear.&nbsp; However, via Dan, I had free drinks and reserved status at the bar.&nbsp; Toward the end of senior year, all I wanted to do was be at a bar, so even if Dan's bar wasn't my first choice, I'd show up.  One evening two of Dan's frat brothers showed up.&nbsp; This guy, Stu Smith and a good-looking blond guy I'd noticed, but never met.&nbsp; Teddy.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

       This weekend I met up with a few friends at this very hip bar in the southern part of the city for some drinks for a birthday.&nbsp; I called my friend Evan earlier that day to ask him to join in the festivities.&nbsp; He called me back around 9:30 or so, already sloshed and starting to slur.  "Sure Lizzy, is it ok if I bring some people?"&nbsp; He sounded super suspicious, so I queried whether he'd be bringing ten people.&nbsp; he assured me that wasn't the case, but by his tone I could tell something was up.  I'd been at the bar drinking citrus sours, a specialty, when Evan walked in, disheveled, unshaven and sporting some new extra pounds and accompanied by Eric, also unshaven and uber casual.&nbsp; Their apparel was out of sync with their surroundings, but no one was pounding down the doors of this trendy establishment.&nbsp; Hot summer weather and no big lines out the back.&nbsp; Eric came over and kissed me and I felt his gritty cheek.  "You look really good, Lizzy."&nbsp;   "Watch out, Eric has your cell phone number now."&nbsp; Evan grinned his cheshire cat smile and smirked in a really sleazy way.  "But you have a girlfriend."&nbsp; I said definitively to Eric.  "Not anymore.&nbsp; Maybe you and I can go on a date."&nbsp; Eric grinned and leered all at once.  "No girlfriend, huh?&nbsp; It's a whole new ballgame."&nbsp; I said, unsure of whether I'd wanted him to say he's single again.&nbsp;
