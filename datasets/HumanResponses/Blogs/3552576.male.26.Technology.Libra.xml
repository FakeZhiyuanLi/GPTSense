      Well, I just bought a house and it's a little daunting to think that I am going to be a homeowner soon.  There are so many wonderful and scary things going through my mind.  I know everything will be okay, but it just seems odd that I am not going into this situation with anyone.  This was never a dream of mine.  I always thought I would meet someone, get married and then find a "home."  So much for dreams.  I am very thankful though.  I understand that everything has a purpose and, while not currently apparent, that I will see the light at some point.  I have so much going on in my life right now.    There are so many wonderful people in this world and I wish I could tell each one of them how grateful I am for their love and support.  There is a certain family that I am so proud to be helping.  I was able to give the father a job to help them pay the bills and to put food on the table.  I don't want any thanks or recognition for that, because it wasn't me who gave him that opportunity, it was Him.  I just wish that He would give me the ability to touch others the way I have touched this one family.  I am grateful for everything I am given; the good and the bad.  This may sound random as it is, completely, but I feel as though I need to start taking a journal.  God Bless you all.

      On the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me," said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.   Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me." He just knew what it was.   "Oh my," he shuddered, "its Satan and the Lord dividing the souls at the cemetery." He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. "Come here quick," said the boy. "You won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls." The man said, "Beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk." When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled to the cemetery.   Standing by the fence they heard, "One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me ..."The old man whispered, "Boy, you've been telling the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord himself."   Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.   At last they heard, "One for you, one for me." And one last "One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence, and we'll be done."   (They say the old man made it back to town five minutes ahead of the boy on the bike!)

      "Tomorrow morning," the surgeon began, "I'll open up your heart..."   "You'll find Jesus there," the boy interrupted.   The surgeon looked up, annoyed "I'll cut your heart open," he continued, to see how much damage has been done..."   "But when you open up my heart, you'll find Jesus in there," said the boy.   The surgeon looked to the parents, who Sat quietly. "When I see how much damage has been done, I'll sew your heart and chest back up, and I'll plan what to do next."   "But you'll find Jesus in my heart. The Bible says He lives there. The hymns all say He lives there. You'll find Him in my heart."   The surgeon had had enough. "I'll tell you what I'll find in your heart. I'll find damaged muscle, low blood supply, and weakened vessels. And I'll find out if I can make you well."   "You'll find Jesus there too. He lives there."   The surgeon left.   The surgeon sat in his office, recording his notes from the surgery, "...damaged aorta, damaged pulmonary vein, widespread muscle degeneration. No hope for transplant, no hope for cure. Therapy: painkillers and bed rest. Prognosis:, " here he paused, "death within one year."   He stopped the recorder, but there was more to be said. "Why?" he asked aloud. "Why did You do this? You've put him here; You've put him in this pain; and You've cursed him to an early death. Why?"   The Lord answered and said, "The boy, My lamb, was not meant for your flock for long, for he is a part of My flock, and will forever be. Here, in My flock, he will feel no pain, and will be comforted as you cannot imagine. His parents will one day join him here, and they will know peace, and My flock will continue to grow."   The surgeon's tears were hot, but his anger was hotter. "You created that boy, and You created that heart. He'll be dead in months. Why?"   The Lord answered, "The boy, My lamb, shall return to My flock, for He has Done his duty: I did not put My lamb with your flock to lose him, but to retrieve another lost lamb."   The surgeon wept.. The surgeon sat beside the boy's bed; the boy's parents sat across from him. The boy awoke and whispered, "Did you cut open my heart?"   "Yes," said the surgeon.   "What did you find?" asked the boy.   "I found Jesus there," said the surgeon.
