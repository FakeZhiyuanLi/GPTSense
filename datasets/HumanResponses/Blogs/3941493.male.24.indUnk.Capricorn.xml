      Met up with Ro n YM today, or rather, yesterday. Met up with Ro first in the afternoon because she took half day from work. Kinda friendly-squabbled throughout, cos she was just so whiny! Like she misplaced her EZ Link card and then accused me of not picking it for her when she dropped her handbag earlier. And then she found that it was in her bag all along. DUH!! So I took her handphone and wacked her head until she bled all over.   And she said that I was so mean. We went over to Bugis, intending to eat Tian Tian Huo Guo. But the air-con section was fully booked, and we did not really wanna sweat it out in the alfresco section, so we decided not to try out if "zhe li de tang tou zhen de heng hao he". We went to eat at Terra inside Bugis instead, where YM joined us LATE. Food at Terra was not bad. You can order a combo of 1 main and 1 soup for under $10, and quantity was ok.  After dinner, YM brought us to TCC Boat Quay, which has a nice ambience. The top floor has all these beanies that you can plonk yourself comfortably in, but air-con was quite cold. Still a nice place to hang out. Back on the train home, I was showing them how loose my Levi's is, and Ro actually kinda saw a little of my crotch. Dunno she purposely or what. Ro, you very chi ko pek leh! Wrong, you should be chi ko um (for lady)! Hope you become one giant walking bud zham!  Again, my brain is over-active and I cannot get to sleep tonight, hence my blogging at 3am in the morning. Was trying to fall asleep just now, and was counting 1, 2, 3, 4... with every breathe and all of a sudden, the phrase "1 neh neh pok" flashed across my mind! For those who think I'm having some fantasy, please lah, it was not the image, but just the phrase. See how over-active and creative my brain is? But "neh neh poks" (pls people, the phrase, not the image!!) did not do the work, so I came to blog. Talking about "nnp", I got reminded of the corny trick questions my tuition boy, Alex, tried on me the previous tuition.  Alex: Teacher, I ask you ah, you got kkb not? Me (kinda wary and weary): Dun have. Alex: What? You got no kuku bird ah? (and he burst out laughing) Me: ...... (   -_-"'  ) Alex: Then Teacher, I ask you ah, now you got kkb not? Me (bracing myself for another lame attempt): You say have then have lor. Alex: Hahaha, then you have king kong bra ah?? Me: ................ (     -_-"'"'   )  Btw, for those who are too naive, the wack-Ro's head-til-bled part is purely fictional. But I did threaten her with that. She said I was gross and mean lor. What else can she do but whine? Back to counting 1 nnp, 2 nnp, 3nnp...

      I seriously think my pc is gonna die on me any time soon. It hangs every now and then, especially for explorer, and I always have to do&nbsp;ctrl+alt+del to end the program. And whenever I load some application, the 'busy' light will&nbsp;be lit on&nbsp;for like half a minute, then the program will slowly load. Stupid comp, so busy with what?&nbsp;Really time to change a new pc before it crashes on me and destroys all my stuff. My sis is starting school, and I need to burn all my pics too, so a new pc should come in handy.   Also have to find someone to scan my "insurance agent" resume picture to my pc&nbsp;so that I can attach it to my resumes&nbsp;whenever stated. LY did try scanning for me at work, but it did not turn out well. SL's  supposed  to get back to me about it&nbsp;in the evening. Well, I think it's best to depend on myself, except I have no scanner, so basically I'm at the mercy of others.

      Gonna try to publish without a blog title, cos everytime i write about something else, I deviate from the title and it becomes kinda irrelevant.  Could not really get to sleep yesterday, a result of my brain being too active again. Was pondering about how times have changed so much. In the past, a man had to marry a woman when all he had to do was so much as to touch a pinkie of hers, and it was called propriety. Now, a man bangs a woman (or another other gender if you like) and it is called ONS. Now people publish their thoughts online instead of keeping them in diaries and let the whole world read them, and it is called blogging. How times have really changed man!  If we fast forward to 50 years down the road, this is what my prediction will be: people will be covering only their essentials, much like Adam and Eve after eating the apple. And everyone will look so perfect, so youthful, so well figured. All due to increasing vanity and advancement in cosmetic surgery. Of course, and more money too. So people would want to flaunt their well-earned figures. I think this scenerio is highly possible. Who in the olden times would have thought women now can wear bikinis and parade in front of millions of viwers? So why not people wear so much lesser in future and be so proud of it? And sex would be just like any other hobby. Like in Demolition Man (if i remember the correct show), sex was just wearing a headgear with another person, and voila, you have real time virtual sex! Sex ala arcade style, anytime, anywhere, anyone!  If my prediction happens, the irony is (in Christian context, of course), we seem to have walked one big round, from being nude to semi-nude, to covering up, and back to being nude again. Return to Garden of Eden. ***Deviating for a while, Return to Eden...hmm, sounds a movie name. Maybe they can make a movie with this title?*** Back to topic. So then, does that mean we are becoming closer to God? Or are we playing God instead, with genetic engineering and all? Ok, I'm not going religious here, just that it seems to be such an irony that we have come full circle to the same point. So are we advancing or actually in retrograde? Think about it, people! Use your brain!

      I must tell all those who got cable to watch channel 52 at 10pm everyday night. There's this show which is so hilarious that its almost too good to be missed. It's called Kang Xi Lai Le, hosted by Xu Xi Di aka Xiao S and Cai Kang Yong (hence the show title Kang Xi). Xiao S is so bimbotic and bitchy, and CKY is almost "too gay to function" (quote Mean Girls), and these 2 make a most hilarious and weird combination that work uncannily. No matter who the guests are, they are always wearing them down with funny questions, like asking a president candidate what kind of underwear he wears, or getting touchy with them.  Yesterday's episode had Xiao Song and Xiao Bo and their brother as guests. It has been so long since I've seen Song Bo!! I used to call them Xiao Song Xiao Bai, but found out only now that the latter is pronounced as Bo. You know how Chinese characters are, read the sides if you dunno the word! I used to like their songs, like Dancing Virus, a Christmas song that I cannot recall the name, etc when I was in Pri school. Anyway, the amazing thing is, the 3 brothers had not met up for a long time due to work, but they could dance VERY WELL in synchronization! With no practice at all! It was very much like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, very retro, but still great.   It occurred to me after the show that synchronised dancing always look great, no matter what kind. I think Indian dance is kinda cool. Not the peek-behind-tree-and-act-shy kind, but those mass dances with a lot of shoulder heavings, gyrating hips, and prancing in cirles. Even the subtle, religious Dervish dance is beautiful and enchanting to me, especially when a group of dancers swirl and swirl together. Look at the movies, all the dances look great when done in a group: Cameron Diaz in Charlie's Angels 1, Jennifer Garner doing a MJ in 13 Going on 30... When done alone, the girls all look like losers. But when done in synchronization in a group, it looks awesome! I think it could be due to a "in group/out group" thingy, whether you are initiated enough (read: able to synchronise) to be in the 'cool gang'. Those who groove with the correct moves are part of the action; those who can't just watch in awe. Hence cheongsters in Zouk all try to get a piece of the action. Heck, I was pretty much into synchronised dancing Zouk-style way back then, when I was kinda a cheongster myself! Dunno how it originated in Zouk, but ever since it got popular, like with mambo-jumbo, it just spread to other clubs. After 3, 4 years, I still can see these moves when I club occasionally. There are variants, but the moves are basically still the same. Think the moves can be considered as retro club classics already!

       urlLink   urlLink     Bei Fang You Jia Ren...    Watched House Of Flying Daggers yesterday. Basically, I thought the plot was little lame. Or should I say, not much plot to talk about. As usual, it was pretty&nbsp;aesthetic, and the colour themes were evident throughout the movie. Certain scenes were beautifully choreographed, such as Xiaomei's dance scene. The way the daggers were 'target-zeroing' was also quite cool. But beyond that, the plot was not developed thoroughly, and it ended with a cliffhanger of sorts. So no big baddie showdown, which was a major disappointment. Maybe the real focus is on the love triangle?&nbsp;But still, I thought&nbsp;Yimou could have at least made a brief wrap-up of the story. The final scene, imho, was pretty laughable. The fight between Andy and Takeshi was a little corny, and the fact that Xiaomei simply refused to die made it worse. It made&nbsp;it seemed like she wanna qiang3 jing4 tou2. Got stabbed, passed out, woke up, muttered 2 words, passed out, woke up and threw dagger accurately when  she was supposed to die , then passed out again. So you thought she was finally dead, then she woke up again!! Is there a secret resurrection technique that members of the House knew and was not mentioned? And why is&nbsp;Ziyi&nbsp;ALWAYS being&nbsp;raped?&nbsp;Is rape victim her on-screen occupation? Or is that Yimou's secret fantasy about her?&nbsp;Not as good as Hero. Hero has a better plot, choreography and cinematography. Think maybe Yimou is&nbsp;betta&nbsp;off making socio-contemporary movies like Big Red Lantern High High Hang.

      Went to see the supposedly famous skin doctor in Tampines with my sis; the entire trip took more than 6 hrs! Left home at 6pm, and reached home at 1215am, goodness!&nbsp;We reached the clinic at 730, got our Q numbers at 53 and 54, but the Q number then was only 22!&nbsp;I finally got to see the doc only at 1030. Wah kaoz, she is bloody famous, man. The last 2 times I went, I also had to wait about the same time. But she must be really good to warrant such popularity. She is not like your average dermatogist, or at least those I've been to. I think she prescribes a more holistic treatment. The normal skin doctors I've been to&nbsp;(I'm not naming any hospital/clinic, but they are those one would usually go to get government subsidies. Nope, not polyclinics cos they are  so &nbsp;much worse. Think it's pretty obvious.) always take a look at you, scribble some notes on your file, then nonchalantly prescribe some cream to "apply to affected area". It's like they would go, "&nbsp;Breakout here, here, here and there. Oh, and there. So use this cream here, here, here, there and there. Come back in 3 months' time." Period.&nbsp;This doctor in the East, she would give different creams/lotions for different areas of the face. Like she would&nbsp;give&nbsp;more gentle prevention lotion for&nbsp;&nbsp;the non-breakout part but stronger medicine on the zits.&nbsp;And she&nbsp;always insists on her patients putting&nbsp;sunblock. So i got myself a whole arsenal of creams and lotions, all for one face. Mine. This way, the whole face is taken care of. It's kinda comestic plus medicinal approach, whereas other doctors would be simply clinical. So I think she is worth the wait, and the money too. On the wall in her clinic hangs a Chinese calligraphy that&nbsp;says Miao4 Shou3 Hui2 Chun1. It roughly translates to "from skilled hands the youth returns." I certainly hope&nbsp;I found myself something that works for me. Finally.

      Had this weird dream on Saturday night. My dad was the monarch and he was gonna have this affair with this evil slut. So my mom was&nbsp;begging him not to do it. Eventually, I broke down and cried like hell, and threatened him that if he ever did it, then I was not gonna forgive him for the rest of my life. He still did it anyway. End of dream.&nbsp;Stupid Evil Slut!! But somehow, I kinda felt a sense of satisfaction and relief when I woke up. It has got nothing to do with the dream not being true, but rather, the whole crying does seem to have a cathartic effect on me. Well, at least that is the function of dreams I learnt in psychology. The other time I dreamt Wowo died too and I cried, and again felt this similar sense of relief.&nbsp;Maybe I have some&nbsp;pent up frustration subconsciously? Thought this&nbsp;phenomenon is kinda cool though. I also dreamt of my own death before. Was killed in a blast on a cruise liner, except I did not realise it and went home as usual. Only when I saw my picture at the altar and my parents were sobbing terribly did I realise I was dead. Equally cool!

      Went to work part time for 4 hrs&nbsp;today evening with ZHui&nbsp;as ushers for some drum performance at the new NTUC Building. Was supposed to work for only 2 hours and get $32. At least that was what the job agency told us. So it's supposed to be $16/hr. Then later the agency said we gotta work the full 4 hrs. So i kena cheated. But, $8/hr is still a good deal to me. Was so glad that the drummers did not comply when the audience shouted encore, otherwise I gotta do OT. But&nbsp;we got&nbsp;to snack after the audience&nbsp;finished their reception food during intermission as we were manning the &nbsp;main door. The other 2 ushers (whom we did not know) were doing the ushering inside the auditorium and could not leave their station. But food was bad cos&nbsp;all the good stuff were eaten up. Managed to send out 4 more resumes in the afternoon, so I hope to get some replies coming in next week. Fingers crossed.

      I think one of the most cardinal sins on a bus is BO! Yes, body odour! Damn, you can just faint from one. Was on the upper deck of a bus going to tuition when I saw a teenage&nbsp;school boy coming up the stairs. He was holding a ball and was looking sweaty, and I&nbsp;was like, DUN COME NEAR ME! Just as coincidence would have it, he sat in front of me. Damnx2!&nbsp;So I had to bear with this strong, perspiring smell in an enclosed, air-con place. Trust me, it was bad. &nbsp; On way home, I had to wait for almost 20 minutes b4 the infamous bus service 99 would trot along. I boarded the 1st bus,&nbsp;and true to 99's tardiness, 2 more 99 buses whizzed past me. Its so dumb that one would have to wait for 20 minutes before 3 buses of the same service would amble along, the 2nd and 3rd usually empty. While waiting for this&nbsp;f*cked up&nbsp;bus, another feeder bus came and all of a sudden, the plastic frame surrounding the bus' signal light fell off, right in front of the bus stop. Yup, unbelievable but true. The bus driver was not aware, and he drove off, spliting and crumbling the plastic frame. Subsequent buses just rode over the plastic with loud cracks. I was thinking should I even bother to put the pieces to the road side, but my irritation from bus-waiting got the better of me. WTF is going on with the&nbsp;bus company?

      Gonna backdate to 14th July, when I had my university convocation. Time really flies, man, and I'm getting old! The convo was kinda boring, cos in a way, I did not make a lot of good friends in uni due to the course structure, and you basically just sit in the hall for almost an hour for less than a minute of fame when the announcer calls you up to receive your certificate. A couple of good friends came though. We did the usual photo-snapping etc. Went back to my faculty afterwards. Was feeling a little nolstagic, but again, I have this love-hate relation with my uni so I can't really comment much. That evening, me and my gang of pals went to this place called Handle Bar to celebrate JX's birthday. Food was plentiful. As usual, we ordered more than we could finish cos we were plain greedy. And hungry. It was also pouring like mad, and the rain was coming in where we were sitting, so we gotta shift, which made us even hungrier. Anyway, the place was kinda small and biker-ish. The waitresses were pretty nice though.  Watched Mean Girls on 15th July. Yup, I know its kinda shallow and bimbotic, but I had nothing better to do ok! It wasn't so bad, could pick a tip or two about backstabbing from the show. Bumped into a ex-camp mate and we chatted for a while about the stupid stuuf that happened back in camp. Gosh, those were the days!

      Spoke to Awang and Minah Rock today. Both faced serious problems in their relationship, and are going through a rough patch now. Hope things turn up better for them both. To Minah Rock, get back on the road soon! And to Awang, partner-turned-psycho is not easy to deal with, so be very tactful and be careful yourself! So, you get a lesson learnt other than the ones about love: treasure your friends! Don't chuck them aside when you are contented with your partner, because you never know when you're gonna need them again!  A little Olympic fever here: Go Susilo Go!

      Just checked my email and found this mail fr DXO: "Dear XYZ,  Thank you for your application.  We have assessed your application favourably and will contact you for an interview if a suitable vacancy arises.  If you no longer wish to be considered for a post in MINDEF, please let us know. You can call ABC at 6*** **** for assistance."  What does this mean???  Favourably  but no suitable vacancy??? Then what about the position I got selected for??? Is this a joke???? So am I in or not????? First they tell me my aptitude results will be out within 2 weeks, and now this ambiguous mail!?   Almost gonna publish my cursings and swearings about Mindef when the fear of the ISD storming my flat and arresting me without trial or exiling me to Sentosa got the better of me. So...nice Mindef **pat pat** nice Mindef.

      Has been working for XW at Republic Polytechnic part time, basically as her PA. So my job involved running errands, helping her collect stuffs here and there and, recently, planning for a Health Awareness Week for her. This latest thing seems too big and brainy for a temp right? And I realised my Excel skills suck. XW pointed it out in a straightforward **wince** but well-meant way.  Celebrated Angeline's birthday on saturday. I think everything likes to come together and clash with each other for me. My secondary school friends, JC friends, and university friends all asked me to meet up on saturday evening. I had to turn my uni friends down, simply could not make it for 3 gatherings within the same night. No more job interviews so far, because I had no time to send resumes ever since working for XW. Waking up early is quite tiring, especially till the end of the day when I still have to give tuition.  Theere should be a law for the lowest taxi speed limit. The cab that we took home today was travelling at 60 throughout. Cars were whizzing pass us both sides, even in the first lane! Hello Uncle, you P plate ah??? Found out that Shyamalan is filming the movie of Life of Pi. This novel is supposed to make one think about God, but it did not work for me. Hope he can make a good movie about it though.

      My mom said the little girl at the beginning of the MTV of the acapella version of Home, sung by The Young Voices, reminded her of a "hantu". Lol, when u look at her, u kinda agree too. She's dressed in white, with long tresses down her shoulders, and sings in a sorrowful, echoic voice. So much for a patriotic song remake.  SI is so damn funny! To Lemon Tree Guy and Stripper, self-humiliation is way beyond pathetic! Please get a life! The judges were betta than I have expected, remarks are quite funny and apt. Best of all, the show is localised, so we totally understand what they mean. But Gurmit still makes me cringe. He's trying very hard to look young. Tight t-shirt and jeans, tries to dance, tries to look funky, but he is BALDING!! Dances like Foo too. FYI, Foo can't dance for nuts' sake.

       urlLink    Behind ya!!  Saw Shyamalan's The Village yesterday. It was pretty good. Even though it was not fast-paced, it was still kinda gripping throughout. There were several twists in the movie, unlike his past works, which usually had one twist in the end. The ending was, as LY said, a little unbelievable. Bryce Dallas Howard is really good, and I think she looks a tad like Juliette Lewis. Adrien Brody is fantastic in his role too. No wonder he won an Oscar.  Colours were symbolically used in the movie. The Village people were all drably dressed, a dissociation from the colourful, thus evil, life that "Towns" people lived. Bad colour is  red  , the colour of  blood . A symbol of the Elders' pains when blood was drawn from their beloved ones. Yellow-orange probably represented fire, what "Those We Do Not Speak Of" feared greatly. The whole village mood, culture and speak (pretentiously formal and polite) all suggested a somewhat Puritan New England setting, and that is where the final twist comes in. It gives a different feel from his past works. Sixth Sense had more horror elements in it. Signs had a similar rural setting, but water-fearing aliens are kinda lame. Was quite glad that we watched this instead of Collateral, because I'm not even remotely interested in Tom Cruise's killing antics.

      Ha! Finally got my 1st job offer! Not bad leh, considering I started looking in early July. Took roughly a month to get this 1st offer. It's a Sales Executive with AMEX, selling their premium products. The basic is what most fresh graduates would expect, and there is commission of course. But I thought about it seriously and decided to pass up this offer. Dun really like doing sales, and JX said if I am really considering a sales job, I might as well join her in Citibank. Her basic is so, so much higher than what AMEX is offering.  So funny, after a period of drought, job hunt prospect suddenly looked good. Went for another interview today with SCB for a position as Customer Service Officer at its call centre. Going for an aptitude test for a DXO position tomorrow, and another interview on Tuesday as a buyer. Most probably I'm gonna pass up the buyer interview as well, not really interested in the job. Really more keen on the DXO job as I heard the benefits are pretty good. But Mindef is quite selective about its DXOs. I gotta pass tons of aptitude tests, interviews, and clearance to be selected. So I may have to wait pretty long b4 knowing if I'm successful for DXO, which means in the meantime, I won't know whether to accept or reject any job offers that comes along. Hmmm....

      Dunno if I should sms MF for my photo. Had it scanned at her place in the afternoon, and she was supposed to send it to me tonight (sunday), but she did not. Think she most probably forgot about it. Getting a little annoyed with all the not-keeping-your-word thingy. But like I said before, I am completely at the mercy of others, because the fact is I'm asking them for a favour. Still, I really need the photo for my resume. Sigh...

      I got called up for another temp job this morn, at 930, by the same job agency who  urlLink cheated me the last time . This time, I had to go to Novena Square to do some promotion for a bank. I was briefly told that I had to hold some banner from 12pm to 4pm, $7/hour. It was far, but I figured I had nothing much to do at home also, so I went down.  The banner turned out to 2 placards that were attached together, and I had to wear them over my shoulders, bearing 1 in front and 1 behind. Si mi?????   *thunder and lightning* So damn malu to be wearing that man!!!! I felt so embarrassed, wearing that walking around and giving pamphlets! Basically, I was literally a walking advertisement. I was hoping so hard that I would not meet anyone I knew. So glad that it was at Novena lor, not somewhere like JP! But I had to be professional since I accepted that job, so I decided to employ my mei3 nan2 ji4 to the task. Whenever I approached someone to give the pamphlet, I would look imploringly at him/her in the eyes, and put on my megawatt smile. But I quickly lost steam, and as time inched by, my megawatt smile become 50 watts only, and I began walking around nonchalantly with my hands tucked into my pockets. And I decided to people watch. Found out and saw some interesting things:    Kids were the ones that were really attracted to my placards. Think maybe it was due to the screaming numbers. However, adults were more interested in the person carrying the placards, ie me. They would look at me, and when I looked back, they would pretend to look at my placards. Maybe I looked funny carrying the placards.  Saw a moderately plump Indian lady with head-sized boobs! No kidding, I swear! Think she needs some real  urlLink kkb !!  Several xiao mao congs were dancing to Hi-5 vcd. They are so, so adorable!  A lady approached me to ask me if I was interested in doing something similar (the placard-carrying) for her company. It is a newly established school for Japanese boys, and the school is called Pink Room. Sounds gay to me. Scarly bluff me to sell... But I blurted out my hourly pay b4 I could decide to jack up the price. Think I will have to disappoint her, cos she would want me to work during lunch hours at Tanjong Pagar. Siao.  Some senior citizens do know their stuff about investment products!  Saw my camp ex-2IC. So much for my hoping. I quickly lied that I was standing in for a friend. Too embarrassed to tell the truth.     There was another guy doing the same thing as me, and he was just standing there, not doing anything. I was so much more professional lor. By the end of my stint, I was hungry and my legs and back were aching. All these for a measly $28.  Met up with the gang for MF's belated birthday celebration. Found out only then that my earlier super malu stint was supposed to be worth a lot more lor, at least $10 instead of $7.   KNN!!! Stupid job agency! Make me do sia suay job still shortchange me!!  Wanted to club after dinner, but as usual, the response from the gang was terribly disappointing. Visited Devil's Bar and left for home shortly because we did not have enough turn out.
