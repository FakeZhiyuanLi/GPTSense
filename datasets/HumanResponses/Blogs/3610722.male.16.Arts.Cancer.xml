      (I feel kind of bad having to go back and say this, but I forgot to originally. This post is entirely dedicated to Michelle, as I am a source of amusement to her. This one's for you baby. Oh, and you don't have to go to hell.)  First of all, I think I should tell you all how much I hate babies. I loathe babies. I think we should have evolved to be cocoons until we were seven.   I was reminded of this at the grad mass. There we are in the Holy Rosary cathedral, my mom, grandma, and I, and we can't hear the priest over the sounds of two of those little assholes. Due to the acoustics in that place, it carried across the whole church.  The worst part about it, though, was that everone was smiling at the "cuteness" of these little human larvae, where I wanted to swaddle them in an unsafely tight fashion. Larvae reminds me of another thing. Babies are the maggots of humanity. Do you want to hug a maggot?  So the church service was long and boring. And, as we discovered later, optional. That one really pissed me off. I got a good meal at Melrose Place in the deal though. Gotta love canneloni.   That's the sum of my grad stories for one day, but of course that's not the important part.   The next day, we got ready and went out for lunch at Tim Hortons. I rather like the Soup Deal, although somehow they managed to hire all stupid employees. The place is never clean, and it takes you half an hour to order. We were almost late for grad.  Arriving at the Centre of the Arts, we discovered that we needed tickets. My brother really dropped the ball on this one. We thought we only needed tickets for the banquet, not the ceremony. Hmm... that would explain why they didn't take our "banquet" tickets... It has just occured to me that maybe the BANQUET didn't need tickets and the CEREMONY did... Well, in any case, people gave us extra tickets, and it worked out.   We headed to the balcony. I saw Devin and his family. And WHAT a family! I can't believe his half-sister comes from the same gene pool as him(half-gene pool I guess.) I mean, I'm walking up the stairs, and I look back to see this unbelievably hot blonde... like... unbelievably. Wow. I'm just going to move on, because I have more to say and I don't want to start any elaborate fantasies... yet.  So we sat down, Devin and company in the box far to the right of us. I talked to my sister for a while, then the grad started. It started with the classic humourous video. Okay, this one was more than humourous, I'd even go as far as to say it was funny. It showed Mr. Houk and some other teacher trying every job they could think of. It was very elaborate. It had them flipping burgers, in the cockpit of a plane, fighting fires, everything. I would never have that kind of attention span. It must have taken them days.  They started with some speaches of something, they did awards, you know, the usual, with the two MC's making jokes inbetween. My brother won the band award. I'm not sure if he even knew about it until this moment. My mom desperately wanted a picture, but she couldn't figure out the camera. I tried to point out the flash to her, but she moved the camera, resulting in my hand hitting the picture taking button thing. No one has ever given me a look that malicious. Not even Rhiannon.  They showed a video of the highlights of the Riffel year. Interestingly enough, it showed Joe carrying a bottle of wine through Italy. I mean, they can't do anything about drinking on the trip, technically it's not a school activity, and it's legal in Italy, but I'm surprised they'd call it a highlight.  They announced scholarships, gave out scrolls, stuff like that. At the end they revealed the entire graduating class from behind a curtain, and they all threw their hats, despite Ms. Stoms objections. It was touching. Really. I can't even begin to describe how I felt through this whole thing, seeing how I would be there in two years, and although I'm looking forward to my life as a musician, I really don't want high school to end. Especially the way things have changed over the last year. I'd go into detail, but I'm boring myself.  Speaking of boring, later that night we went to the banquet. After waiting for about seven hundred people to go to the buffet before us, really, we got our food. Best part of the day. God, if I could go back in time to any point in history it would be that part of the night to eat that meal again. Turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, various vegetables, chocolate mousse, all kinds of cakes, pumpkin pie, brownies... it was awesome.  There were toasts and stuff after this. Still boring. Some of them were more long winded and over-the-top than others. Kim Barschels for example. Actually, that's the only one that comes to mind, probably because it took up more time than all of the other toasts combined.   They had a little dance after. I sat at my table and tried to stay awake. Alex was macking up the grade 12 hunnies. I would have gone in there, but it was their special night, and I didn't want to take all of the attention.   (I originally forgot, also, that Kozey gave me a hug. It was touching. Speaking of grad and moving on and whatnot; as much as I like out current Rylan, I can't wait until he ends up a creepy old man who lures children into his house with candy.)  That's about it, really, my brother went to after-grad and I came home, went to sleep, woke up, didn't write this, went to devins, came home, went to sleep, woke up, and wrote this. You guys suck.  --From here on it's instinctual, even straight roads meander, every piece contains a map of it all.--

      As I write this, I'm getting ready to go to my brothers graduation banquet.   Expect a long post on the whole grad thing.   For now, however, I will tell you ladies out there what I am wearing, to feed your fantasies. This is what you should be picturing coming off:   I am wearing camel dress pants, my blue wide collared shirt, and light-weight navy-blue blazer. Oh, and my new shoes, black with a camel pattern on the sides, kind of a bowling shoe type of thing.   In other words, I look hot, but in a formal way, as opposed to the casual look I am usually so stylishly sexy in.  When I come back, or tomorrow, I will write an entry on this whole grad thing.

      Well, the LB adventure wasn't really exciting enough to write about. Sorry man.   On the plus side, I do have something to write about.  Well, today, battling back some crippling dissapointment from an unrelated source, I wrote my science final. It was reasonably easy, I know I at least passed it, and all I needed to pass the class was a 30%+.   I then get home and sit around for a while. I find that one of my bastard family members has taken my guitar put all of the tuning pegs in one position.  I do not have a good enough ear to figure out what a proper E is, and I don't have a tuner, so I'm going to have to spend some time with my brothers keyboard. I'm going to wear out his middle E after enough of this. If I don't remember to pick up a tuner at the same time as my new picks, strings, and maybe even acoustic (happy birthday to me).  My sick little sister (actually physically ill) is lying on the couch watching Much Music, which she watches more than me. She's really getting into music. One of her favourite bands is Billy Talent. I am feeling the sibling bond strengthen as she takes interest in something I care about, so I don't have to like, say, unicorns and ballet.   I just finished cleaning my room. I actually put in a lot of effort, there's not a speck of dust in there, I arranged all of my assorted music stuff, basically personalized everything a little more. The reason for the cleaning? My grandma is coming to visit for my brothers grad. She lives in Kitchener, Ontario, so it's been a while since I've seen her. My parents thus make this into a really big deal, resulting in the aforementioned forced cleaning.   Now to practice guitar. After I tune it properly, I'm going to go through the excerices my guitar teach taught me for the summer. Maybe I'll work on some ear training. He said if I work on this stuff I'll improve more over the next two months than I have through all this year, so I'm going to be spending a lot of my summer beside LB's amp, assuming mine isn't fixed. Kind of makes me feel guilty, actually. Oh, and if I get an acoustic I can play outside all summer. That would be so awesome.   Well, yeah.   --Your tongue is a rudder, it guides the whole ship, sends your teeth past your lips, or keeps them safe behind your teeth.--

      Well, this is my first post in a while...   I've realized something. My life isn't the slightest bit interesting. How do I even live? I mean, I get up, I usually eat breakfast, I go to school, sometimes I hang out with some people, I come home, I chat on msn or whatever, and I sleep.   This changes sometimes. Like tonight, I'm going to LB's to make a game for gym in his pool. You can expect an update on that.  I guess my point is, I have good reason for not updating. My life is boring.   --And if you go, furious angels will bring you back to me.--

         Well, to start off, it's the morning after the ska show at the exchange, but last night I was too tired and lazy to write about it.      Yesterday as I was writing my last post I was waiting for my sisters friend to pick her up so I could go to Lunchboxes house. He was telling me to hurry up on msn. My sisters friend came, and I was on my way.     He was waiting for me in his garage, as usual, and we went to his basement.      We talked to Jackie on msn for a while, and I beat him 25:1 at halo... that was after he gave up at about 17:1 and I just kept shooting him.      We got to the exchange at 7:45, but the doors didn't open until 8:00, so LB's dad just drove for a while. We got back, and we were the first two people in there except for the ticket guy and the sound guy. We sat on stools for a while.     About fifteen minutes later, LB decided to ask what was going on. It turned out that The Kingpins got in late, so the bands were eating at this point. The show would probably start at 9:30.     We argued for a while about what to do next. I wanted to go somewhere, despite the fact that we were in the warehouse district and likely to get stabbed. I finally just got up and started walking away, so LB came to.      As we were leaving he was skipping and singing "we're off to see the wizard..." and a car load of people laughed at him. Although since they were goths I'm thinking they might have been laughing at his emo clothes. Fucking goths.     We went to A&B Sound, and just fucked around for a while. We looked at the punk music section, talked about bands, looked at some car audio equipment, I was playing with a deck that looked like it might break, we played with cameras, and then I got a Brisk from a weird-looking vending machine and we left.  We went back to the Exchange, and I found out that we only blew about half an hour at A&B. But at least there were more people now.      We played with my bouncy ball for a while by bouncing it across our table, but then it got picked up by a little girl and I didn't have the heart to take it back. I'm such a nice guy.      We had a conversation about what people who listen to ska should be called. LB thought they were already called SKAnks. Which sounds funnier, skanks, or skonks?     The show finally started, and Skavenjah came on. They put on the best show I've ever seen. Not only was the music amazing, but they were all wearing black suits, and they were dancing like reggae-dixieland-jazz musicians. Chad Guy, the singer(his day job is managing stuff at the Centre of the Arts) has a lot of rhythm.  He also got me two free tickets to The Distillers a while back, as I have connections via my dad.      I didn't want them to stop playing, but when they did I immediately went over to the merch table and bought their newest CD, "Light it up".      The Kingpins took a while to come on, and even longer to do their soundcheck, but when they started they actually won my respect. It took to about the second song for me to admit they were actually good, but that's probably because Skavenjah was such a hard act to follow. I didn't buy a Kingpins CD though.  When it was over, we waited outside for my parents. At midnight. In the warehouse district.      We saw two people walking up to us, and we pretended not to see them, as we were afraid of being shanked. We avoided eye contact, but they wanted to talk. It turned out they just wanted to know if the Kingpins were still playing. We told them they had finished. They looked dissapointed.      My parents came, and nothing really eventful happened on the way home. I came home, considered posting an entry, but decided to leave it to today.      Well... I guess that's it. On a side note, I had wanted to invite Rhiannon to this show, since she's into music, and she would have enjoyed it, but she's at her dads house this weekend. Well, Skavenjah's a local band, and they play lots of shows, so we'll make a skank of her yet.   Ok, this isn't a lyrics quote, but it's a quote... that counts too. ---This is another new song, it's called "Shine On". We don't have a third verse yet, so I might just repeat the first one. And I'm ok with that.---  Chad Guy,  Skavenjah

      Well, I'm getting ready to go to the show now, it's only a couple hours after my first post...    I just got my learners license, $40 for merch at the show, dropped something off for devin, and picked up food... I am dissapointed with the food, however, as it is chewy and rubbery.    This is probably the most interesting content you can expect from my blog. Fuck all y'all.  ---You couldn't last a lifetime between here and the days of it, carving her name across your arm.

       Well, everyone was making a blog, and I want to be popular...  I'm going to a ska show tonight... Skavenjah and The Kingpins baby... but until then I don't really have anything to say.   How about a story?    Well, once apon a time, there was a grasshopper and an octopus. The grasshopper spent all his time burying acorns for the long winter, while the octopus just mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV.   When the winter came, the grasshopper died off in the cold and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also, he got a racecar.    Looks like that's the end of this post... but at the end of all of my posts I'll leave a lyrics quote to show how artistic and clever I am.   ---Slowly the pen touches paper, in the guidance of the words that you write.---

      There is nothing better than jamming on a guitar. I say this with my limited knowledge of the subject. I will admit, that having only played for about eleven months, with about six of those have lessons, I can't exactly wail. But it's still awesome.   The other day, a friend of mine from work sent me some songs he recorded on his computer. He's just amazing. Like, if I can be that good in three years(he's played for four) I'll be so proud of myself. All I can focus on is trying to improve now.   I've started experimenting with my style and tone. I cranked up the high on my amp, and tuned my electric up four steps, because I love really bright sound, as opposed to Taylor, the guy I work with, who prefers a lower, metal/hard-rock type of sound.   I can't wait until I get my Digitech RP80 pedal, which I've already ordered, and I'm buying friday, because I'll be able to experiment with tons of different effects, too.   Just thinking about it makes me want to get back to playing, so I'm done with writing.   --I will play until the sky is black.--&nbsp;

      Ok, first of all, Alex is a good guy. I mean, he doesn't always make sense... in fact, he almost never does, but that's mostly just amusing. I used to get frusturated by&nbsp;Alexs communication problems to the point where I'd get mad at him, but I feel guilty about that now. It was pretty bad actually, we used to have arguments on msn when I decided to challenge him about something he said, which&nbsp;would prompt a reply that didn't&nbsp;make sense either, which would irritate me, starting a vicious cycle of annoyance on both sides. Since then, I've actually spent a lot more time around him, and have discovered that it can actually be very enjoyable. I thought I would make this all clear before I continue with my new entry.   The conversation I am about to present&nbsp;was found today in "My Documents". I had forgotten I had saved it, hence this extra-special surprise post. It is&nbsp;actually around the point I started to get more patient (ie not get frusturated by innocent, even well-meaning things that he said) with him. It therefore only gives you a taste of how hostile our conversations used to get. In fact, I'm pretty proud of how well I handled this, considering I was in kind of a bad mood, and he was being more antagonistic than usual.   To set the scene: I'm not sure exactly what was said in the conversation a few minutes prior to this one, but if I'm not mistaken it&nbsp;comprised of a few "hi"s and "how's it going?"s, before he accidentally irritated me. I blocked him.&nbsp;A few minutes later I unblocked him, feeling a little bad about it. The first couple of things he said, however, set me off again.  &nbsp;  Enjoy! (By the way, Alex, if you want me to take out this post just tell me, but I figured it wasn't really anything embarassing or insulting&nbsp;to you, and the stuff you say in your blog doesn't make sense either. Seriously, no hard feelings intended.)    Note: The bold comments are all thoughts I came up with while editing this conversation for the blog... written today.     Fluter who needs thursday? says:   oook man   S p e n c e r says:   what?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   nah nothin ill leave you and your misery alone   S p e n c e r says:   what misery?   S p e n c e r says:   do you actually have a reason you said that?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   do you think so?   S p e n c e r says:   no   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   well if you really think that then somethings wrong with your noggin   S p e n c e r says:   ok, what misery?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   what do you really think it is?just look deep into your brain and give an answer and it might be right   S p e n c e r says:   umm... there is none?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   well i can tell you that your never going to be a psychiatrist   S p e n c e r says:   because I'm not miserable?   (haha, I'm so clever!)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   bah nevermind i cant bring my  knowledge  into your brain today, its a thursday and i dont make sence on thursday   S p e n c e r says:   I just want to know, you think I'm miserable?   (Notice me desperately trying to maintain my patience... is it wrong to be proud of how far I got?)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   well not really, but you should be   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   and i dont have an answer for why so suck it up   S p e n c e r says:   so, I should just be miserable?   S p e n c e r says:   for no reason?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   for reasons unexplainable because i dont know what your lifes like   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   that are*   (If I'm not mistaken, it took me a few minutes to wrap my brain around this one.)    S p e n c e r says:   so, you just assume there's a huge problem in my life that should depress me?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   ah now we are getting somewhere   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   sorry about that ill leave you alone now as usual my craziness only goes so far and most likely you think there was no point to this exercise but there is   (I think this is where I lost it... there's a few more patient responses after this, but it was just a matter of time at this point.)    S p e n c e r says:   what exercise?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   what i just did aahhh   S p e n c e r says:   ok, what was the point?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   members of the jury i plead temporary insanity   S p e n c e r says:   you do realize you didn't find out anything, right?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   is that what you think?   S p e n c e r says:   uuh, yeah   S p e n c e r says:   what did you find out then?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   well i found out that you dont remember past conversations even a minute after you sign back on   S p e n c e r says:   ok, so if I recall, I blocked you because I didn't want to bother making small talk with you   S p e n c e r says:   what does that have to do with anything?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   as usual in some other place youll find out...   (Huh??   I mean... WTF!?!?)    S p e n c e r says:   what?   S p e n c e r says:   I assume that in english that means "I will find out from something else", but would you care to explain what is "usual" about that, and where I will find this out?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   usual because i say that quite a bit and i cant rightly say but how about on albert street there you go   S p e n c e r says:   what does Albert Street have to do with anything?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   hmm...maybe ill make more sence if i stop talking to myself again, you know things just cant piece together   S p e n c e r says:   ok, let's start here.... why do you think I'm miserable?   (Let's take it from the top!)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   why do you keep asking?cant i say things just because i think thats what you are?just like saying some chicks hot and she asks why its very hard to explain why   (Boobies? Ass? Hips? Face? Etc?  )    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   are*   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   do you get where im going here?or are you totally thinking this is still pointless talking to somebody like me   S p e n c e r says:   well, what I got out of it is that you told me I was depressed, I said I wasn't and asked why you thought that, and you told me you actually got information about my psyche from that   (The word "psyche" kind of seems out of place, doesn't it? I think I used it in reference to the fact that he thought he had done some psychological experiment on me, and the fact that he had told me I wasn't going to be a psychiatrist.)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   psyche what do you mean by that   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   you thinking im making way off predictions again   S p e n c e r says:   no, not psychic, I think you're trying to convince me you actually know what the fuck you're talking about   (Oooh... getting a little testy now.)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   hell i try and do that all the time to everybody...but to no avail...   S p e n c e r says:   so you're admitting that you DON'T know what you're talking about?   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   no it means that i should put my english together, because if i dont everyone will just put me in a mental hospital...   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   im admitting*   S p e n c e r says:   ok, try reeeeeally hard, and tell me what this conversation was actually about, and what you've been talking about   S p e n c e r says:   if you give me a good answer I will never insult you're intelligence or english skills again   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   alright ill put alot of effort into this long sentence explaining what im trying to say, im just forewarning you it still wont make sence   S p e n c e r says:   ok   (Frankly, no surprise... but at least he knows it too, and it usually doesn't matter, I was just kind of a dick back then.)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   well you see...you said you didnt want to bother making small talk with me and im thinking why would you block people just because they make small talk? well anyways i just decided to make you think i have temporary insanity just so you would ask questions of what the hell am i doing just so its not really small talk   S p e n c e r says:   you're pathetic   (This is the point where I stop trying to actually make points with him, because, and I mean this with no ill-will at all, it's kind of futile.)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   in the mean time however i didnt mean misery i tried to think of another word but i couldnt find what i was looking for so i just decided to keep it   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   but it worked didnt it?   (*Sigh* back-peddaling... sadly, this made me more angry.)    S p e n c e r says:   you said misery before you found out I blocked you because I didn't want to make small talk   (Trying to&nbsp;tell him&nbsp;that his explanation is out of chronological order.)    S p e n c e r says:   you're just trying to sound smart   S p e n c e r says:   I'm out   S p e n c e r says:   you're the most pathetic excuse for a human being I have ever met   (Sorry about that one, buddy... we're still cool, right?)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   hold on!!!!   (I think I got really frusturated and tried to leave while he was typing a long message, which is why he tells me to wait.)    Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   no no man misery i didnt mean to put it and i was trying to back it up because i tried to think of another word but i couldnt find what i was looking for so i was either thinking you left because you werent actually talking to anyone or you just thought i was trying to make small talk therefore i pretty much already knew what you were going to say dammit   (Hmm... did I even read that at the time?)    S p e n c e r says:   fuck you're dumb   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   and this paragraph has some errors in it and the subject kind of is two subjects but other than that i thought i put my point out   S p e n c e r says:   I'm saving this convo   S p e n c e r says:   maybe someday I will be able to make you realize how stupid you are   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   lol   Fluterwho needs thursday? says:   man someday youll realize that when i live in a whacked up world i can say something whacked up and to me it will make sence but near impossible to people who do not understand what point im trying to make   S p e n c e r says:   I'm saving that too   (In retrospect, I find that last comment unbelievably funny.)   &nbsp;  Well, that's the conversation. I hope you found it as amusing as I did (today), and I'm sure alex will.

      Some interesting stuff actually happened yesterday.   It started with me waking up at noon. I got up, ate, showered, did whatever I do when I wake up. Then I went on msn. I think Devin was on for a while. Then at about 1:30 Rhiannon signed on. I talked to her about the fireworks. She said not many people were comming apparently. I don't remember much, we talked, and then Devin put us into one conversation, and we decided the three of us should do something.  I'm missing about two hours in my memory, because the next thing I know it's 3:30 and I'm at Devins house, calling Rhi. She picks up, says some lazy stuff about how she hates us, and we're not worth the walk to Planet Ice Cream, and how she'll eat our skin, but I convince her to come. We wait a few minutes in Devins house for some reason, then start the walk.  We pass by Alex Fluters house, and notice that there are two bikes outside. One of them is Conrads. We know how much Rhi likes the cliquey little groups, so we decide to invite them along.  The front door is wide open, with the screen shut, and Mrs. Fluter tells us to come in. We walk in to find Alex and Conrad sprawled across the couch and floor, totally silent. Apparently they were playing Spiderman 2 for like two hours, and didn't save, and it froze on a loading screen. Actually perfect timing for us to come, I think.  At Planet Ice Cream, we had to wait for a while, since Rhiannon is an inconsiderate person. During the wait, I went across the street to the bank. Here I had a conversation with Ryan Wild about his stomach surgery and stuff. I also found out I had money in the bank. I withdrew $20 and headed back across the street.   Surprise surprise, Rhiannon was still making us wait. When she finally showed up, she said it was because she was tired or something. Frankly I wasn't listening.   When we left Planet Ice Cream, Conrad and Alex went back to try Spiderman 2 again, I think. Devin, Rhi, and I went to the park. We stood there for a while. I payed Devin to trick kick since he has injured knees and I wanted to see him in pain. We walked to a bench and sat down. Rhiannon was late getting home because of us, but we didn't really care. It started raining, but for some reason she'd rather walk, and be even later, in the rain, then get a ride from Devins brother.   Now for the fireworks. We had a four-way convo on msn with Mike, Devin, Rhiannon, and I, and it was quite funny. I was something of an asshole to Rhi, but nothing was hurt but feelings. Before leaving, she gave us the instructions to be on "The bridge closest to the leg."  Let me explain why this angers me.  First of all, the bridge closest to the leg. implies multiple bridges. There is one bridge. THE ALBERT STREET BRIDGE!!!!! I didn't think she could have meant that one, because surely she would have called it by name. So I expected there to be a little bridge somewhere near the leg. Of course, I was wrong. More on this later.  Back on track in the timeline, I was walking to Devins, listening to The Planet Smashers. I noticed that a truck pulled up beside me. It was Marcus and Kuhn. I hopped into the back of their truck, and they gave me a ride for about a block. I told them we were going to the fireworks, and they said "Alright, when's that shit starting at?" We never did see them though.  More complications at Devins. His parents aren't home, so we couldn't leave, due to his little brother. We sit and watch Family Guy for a while, and then his mom comes in at about 9:50. We head out.  Unfortunately, Devin had to turn retarded on Albert Street. He saw them, apparently yelled something to that effect(I couldn't hear in the back, due to Mikes sound system) and jumped out of the car while moving. This resulted in us Walking through the park the whole time swearing about him.   Of course, then everyone says "Well, we yelled and waved at you!" as if I'm stupid for not finding them. Lets see, it's dark, and there is a crowd of hundreds of people. I'm supposed to see and hear a small group of people? And of course they could see us, we were separate, Devin new where we were coming from, and we were walking down the path, without a crowd to hide us.  Jackie says "There are lights all along Albert Street Bridge!" but come on, so we're supposed to see some people we know, in a crowd of hundreds, at a distance, because of some shitty orange lights?  So we meet Devin at the car, and I yell at him. He tells us we're invited to Erins house. Neither of us remember where Erins house is.   So we're driving down the Lewvan, with Devin giving vague instructions. We have no clue where to go.   We finally decide to stop at a Shell to use the payphone, and look for a Wetherill in the phonebook. Their payphone doesn't have a phonebook. We head inside to see if they have any in there, but before we can go in we see the Filyks walk out! Bizzare coincidence.   We talk to them, and Rory lets us use his cellphone. Unfortunately, there's no answer. He gives us directions to the Wetherill residence, and we head out.   We follow his directions, which were quite accurate, and we find ourselves on her street. To further identify the house, we find Shawn Brooms Bonneville parked outside, and we remembered Rhiannon telling us that he drove one. We thus concluded that God wanted us to be there.   We told the story a couple times, hung around, and I think I might have pissed some people off. On the plus side, Erin invited us to a movie, and I think my invitation still stands, but I can be an obnoxious person. So now, half an hour after I woke up, it's 4:05, and I want to find out what's going on tonight.
