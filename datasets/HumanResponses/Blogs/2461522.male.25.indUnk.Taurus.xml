      We all want to give a good impression to our parents, right?  We want them to be proud of us and see us as mature adults.  I just remembered that over Thanksgiving break, my mom taught me a new Korean word - 'jebee-jo.'  She used that to describe me.  I asked what that meant, and the literal translation has something to do with a bird swooping down or something...or analogously describing a guy who dresses up, goes out to the bars, gets the ladies drunk, then swwoooop...takes 'em home.  So, I guess it's a Korean slang term for 'player'.  I should clearly note that she used that term only to describe the way I dress...nothing to do with my personality or what I would actually do.  I don't do much swooping.  For the record, I (or probably any of my friends) don't think I dress anything like a player.

      I hope everyone had a good First Flight Centennial.  I certainly took time out in my day to reflect upon the Wright brothers' great achievement.  Uhh, riiight...  Everyone was at the celebration in Kitty Hawk, NC, including astronaut John Glenn, which was a little disappointing.  Why disappointing?  Well, in 2001, the church I was going to in Northern Virginia celebrated its 50th anniversary.  John Glenn was a member of the church while he was in the area.  In fact there is a nifty plaque somewhere in the church recongnizing him.  He was invited to the 50th anniversary spectacular, but he didn't show up.  Jerk.  So instead, I got to listen to the oldest living member tell us "how it was back in the good old days."  On a more serious note...  For those of you who have seen Ari's blog recently will have noticed his reply to my call for a truce.  If you haven't seen it, don't worry about it.  Ari somehow thought my request meant that he won, and let's just say he is a poor winner.  But I'll give him that.  He's been suffering a long losing streak.  Poor Michigan State.  The last time I saw anything free-fall so quickly....  Well, let's just leave it at that.

      It's time to call a truce.  This blog war I've been having with Ari has gone on long enough.  Too many tears have been shed and friendships have been broken.  We shouldn't be drawing lines to divide us, but rather creating bonds to unite us.  Ari and I could be making a grand statement - two competitors (and even Christian vs. Jewish) finding common ground and joining forces to fight evil together, rather than fighting against each other.  What a beautiful thing.

      So, we finally caught Saddam.  I think it would've been funny if when we cleaned him up and shaved his beard, we shaved a nice Hitler mustache for him.  Anyway, that's the extent of my political commentary.  In other news, Bill has left us.  I dedicate this post to 'Wild' Bill Curtis.  He is the reason most of my class came to Duke.  We will forever have ingrained in our minds the image of Bill preaching to us up on the altar at the Joyce, reminding us that North Carolina does indeed have beaches and mountains, but they're both too far away from Durham to really enjoy during school.

      I rule.  And so does Kevin.  We passed econometrics!  I've never been so happy to get an 'S'.  For those of you who don't know the Duke grad school grading scale, 'S' stands for 'super'.  I also just finished my micro exam.  I'm pretty positive I passed that class too.  I am a happy Dan.  **We are the champions, we are the champions....no time for losers 'cause we are the champions...**  I thought I'd also share an exciting idea I had the other day.  I was thinking about my future, so naturally, I began thinking about my future children.  Then I thought about names for them.  I'm going to name my kids after the greek alphabet.  So, my first born will be Alpha.  Then comes Beta.  How sweet is that?  I think the best is going to be Epsilon, which would be a great girl's name.  Epsi for short.  Kind of cute, eh?  But that's a lot of kids....kid number five.

      Quoting an email from Kevin Morrison: Folks, I ran into Ralph in the hall just now -- for those who don't know, he's a bright first year econ student -- and he was saying everyone got their ass kicked on that exam this morning.  He was hilarious: he said,  "My bald spot was standing on end when I looked at that exam."

      I just had perhaps my most painful exam, which was in econometrics.  I should note that I had some crazy dreams last night, including being chased by someone trying to kill me while I was trying to protect a teddy bear.  I don't know what that means, but I suppose that was a bad omen.  The exam could have been a nice experience.  After I read each question, I thought to myself, "Huh, that's an interesting question.  I'd actually like to know the answer to that."  What sucked was that I didn't know how to answer any of them.  Although we had weekly homework assignments, the exam wasn't representative of those assignments at all...or an old final that Barb gave to us to study from.  I've had my doubts about econometrics before, so during the exam, I decided that 'metrics isn't my thing.  So, I decided not to take it next semester.  But then I realized that I wasn't doing so well in microeconomics either.  That's when I thought to myself, "Geez, I'm totally screwed!"  I pondered whether I should be in grad school at all.  After about five or ten minutes of this heated internal debate, I returned to the task at hand - getting a nice ass-whooping from the exam.  On the bright side, the exam wasn't very mentally tiring (paradoxically).  I was so clueless on so many of the questions, it really didn't matter if I thought long and hard about it or not, so I pretty much went for the latter.  As another bright spot, my TA, Xin, is no longer my TA.  Oohhh....how I have a crush on her.  Nobody seems to understand why though.  Kselman keeps grumbling how she better hope that they don't cross paths on the street.  True, it's pretty apparent that she has communication issues.  But hopefully it something that can be overcome by the language of love.

       "False.  Lexicographic preferences as counter-example.  Formal proof left to grader as an exercise."   That's the best answer I gave on any of my homeworks all semester.   True or false or uncertain?  "I'm starting to think like an economist...pretentious."   Proof left to you as an exercise.

      I'm back for you viewing pleasure...  I'm not much of a psychologist, but let's just say I'm very self-aware.  I'm in the middle of finals week, and I'm taking note of how I'm dealing with the pressure.  There have been a few main stages.  First was denial.  "Finals aren't a big deal.  Maybe my professors will cancel them so they can go home to watch The Osbourne's Christmas special instead."  Next came fear.  "Holy crap!  I have finals coming up!"  Then came frustration.  "This sucks.  I can't understand anything.  Did I even learn anything at all this semester?!"  Then came the good one.  Acceptance. "It's okay.  How much will this grade really affect me in the long-run anyway?  And no matter how hard I study, I'm going to do poorly anyway."  Ah yes, acceptance was good.  But then came the unexpected return to fear.  I didn't foresee this cyclic nature.  Alas.  It's out of my control.  Ahh, yes!  I think I've made it back to acceptance!

      I finally got the motivation to set up a blog.  And all thanks to  urlLink Ari .  My motivation is to have a blog that attracts more visitors than his.  I can't imagine it being too difficult.  Ari, notice my skillful use of the sHifT key.  Okay, maybe my motive for starting this blog is not so noteworthy.  I'm really not that competitive a person.  So, why do people have blogs?  I don't get it.  I'm only a baby-blogger, so maybe I'll learn with experience.  Shoutouts to my homeboyz (and girlz) holding it down in da comp lab, my students in PS91D (good luck on the final...you're going to need it), everyone back in the 612/763, my peeps back in Madtown, the Latin School, my brotha's in the Bureau, my bro chasing down Saddam in Iraq, and anyone else I didn't mention.  HOLLA!

      So, I got a haircut the other day, and it didn't turn out so good.  I was even thinking of wearing a hat to school today.  But I figured, why hide it?  I gotta be proud.  But seriously, what's the deal with Great Clips?  There's nothing great about that place.

      North Carolina is such a great state!  It snows a few inches, and the Governor declares a state of emergency.  Classes are cancelled for both Monday and Tuesday.  But of course, there is a downside.  The downside is that the "effective" size of my television screen is cut by 20%.  All day long, they're running school and business closings on the bottom of the screen on every local channel.  It's getting annoying.

      There was actually a somewhat funny line on the Simpsons tonight.  Bart, Lisa, and Marge went into some mega bookstore (picture Barnes and Noble).  Bart said something like, "I'm going to taunt to PhD's," running up to a counter with a few 20/30-somethings.  Bart says to them, "I heard an assistant professorship opened up."  The guys at the counter perk up and get a little wide-eyed.  Bart ends by saying, "At the University of...'Psyche'!!"  I hope that won't me...PhD in hand with only a job at a bookstore.  That'd be sad, but it's a possibility.

      They say that as you grow older, your perception of time speeds up.  I think that sucks.  There isn't nearly enough time to get everthing done that I need to get done, and it's only getting worse with each passing day.  On top of this "natural" progression, I worked in the government for a year.  This nurtured habits of procrastination and the ability to pass hours quickly without purpose.  The combination of these two forces (one natural and the other unnatural) has really debilitated me.  I find it so difficult to meet deadlines (for homework), and I tend to be late to everything.  It's nice to know that things will only get more difficult each day.

      I just got my fingernails buffed a couple of days ago.  I'm a fan of buffing nails.  It makes them look so much nicer and makes me feel all nice and clean.  Shiny and smooth....they way I like 'em.  And no, it's not metro. It's just good hygiene.

      So, this past weekend, I went to eat some Mexican grub at Carrburritos with a bunch of people.  To my happy surprise, I saw someone with a Wisconsin sweatshirt on.  Dennis asked if I was going to say "Go Wisconsin" to the guy.  I thought that'd be kind of cheesy.  But he insisted, telling me how he would do the same if he saw someone with a Michigan State shirt on.  Needless to say, I was won over by his persuasive argument.  So, I yelled out at the top of my lungs, "GO BADGERS!! YEAH!"  The eating establishment, which was pretty busy at the time, went dead silent for a good five seconds, so then I felt kind of foolish.  The guy I was screaming at just blankly stared back at me.  I was kind of pissed he was just hanging me out to dry.  Then a girl he was with informed me that she went to Wisconsin and gave him that sweatshirt as a gift.  Oh, and Dennis was totally shocked I yelled that out loud, which I didn't get.  I mean, he told me to do it.  But apparently, he was expecting me to just "say" it, rather than "shout" it out loud.  But I figure if you do something, you gotta go all out.

      So, what has Dan been thinking?  Well, not much really....hence, the absence of posts the past two weeks.  But now school is starting up again, so I suppose I have to start thinking again.  Boo.  Actually, I did my share of mental exercises over the break, mainly in the form of board games.  I am officially the Scrabble champion of the greater-Chicago area.  I play to win, not to look pretty...so I don't feel bad playing dinky little three-letter words, so long as they rack up 30 points.  Then there's "Catch Phrase", which is basically "Taboo" with one annoying electronic buzzer replaced with another.  But I'm not so good at that game...  Have I mentioned how I hate airports and air travel?  I missed my flight out of Chicago after United said my flight was delayed 2 hours, but then decided at the last minute that it would be on-time instead.  Sure, maybe they thought it was funny, but I thought that was a pretty dirty trick.  Then there was tonight, picking up Rehm.  He had a 4 hour layover in Philly, but his luggage still managed not to make the connection.  Apparently, it takes over 4 hours to re-check, scan, re-scan, re-scan, etc. luggage coming in from international flights.  This is a travesty.  What did Rehm do to deserve this?  All because he's German?!  Terrible.  Plus, I ended up having to wait around with Rehm for over an hour to find his bag, and all because I'm Asian.  The Bush administration obviously doesn't like people "different" from them.

       Kevin Morrison is one funny dude.  So, his girlfriend held a surprise birthday party for him Friday night.  The plan was for him to be out with a friend, while the girls would have their own girls night out.  Anyway, Kevin was tricked into stopping by his place.  He walks in with his buddy and says, "Guys invading!"  No one was sure whether he suspected anything.  That quote makes it pretty evident that he had no clue.  That's about as bad as me walking into my own suprise birthday party my senior year of high school.  I walked into my bedroom (lights were all out with everyone hiding out in there) singing Twisted Sister.  "We're not going to take it!  We're not going to take it anymore!"

       ESPN definitely has diversified programming.  One day, I can watch basketball.  Then another, poker.  Then that next morning, a spelling bee.  Later that afternoon, watch some Scrabble.  Today, it was table tennis.  And it wasn't just table tennis, but, as the announcer said, "extreme table tennis."  It's amazing how they can fly across the floor and hit those crazy top-spin shots.  Truly amazing athletes.  Maybe second to golfers.  I used to be quite the table tenniser back in the day.  I still have a couple paddles laying around and some paddle cleaner.  Yup, they called me Soy Sauce, because my game had flava'.  Holla!

        I wrote a  urlLink letter  to the school newspaper, The Chronicle.  It actually got printed yesterday.  It's fun poking fun at those Cameron Crazies once in a while.  Some of my friends think I should worry a little, but I haven't gotten any hate mail yet.  And no, I'm not really that vulgar in real life.

       We learn something new about ourselves everyday.  Yesterday, I found out that i can change a flat tire.  I think I kept my cool in the face of adversity.  Tof might say otherwise, but whatever he says, it's not true.  So, I actually kind of like being back in NC. Whenever I meet random Raleigh folk, it's not so hard to figure out 6 degrees of separation from them.  For instance, I met one guy who went to middle school with one of my good buddies growing up.  He said he and a bunch of people made fun of him becaues he always wore Adidas.  I told him he was a jerk, and "jokingly" nudged him.  But seriously, he probably is still a jerk.  So what if my friend was a soccer jock?  Better than being a stupid NC hick.  Saw another person wearing a Wisconsin sweatshirt last night.  Again yelled "Go Badgers!!"  And again, got a lackluster response.  So disappointing.

       I took a few minutes to glance at some other blogs.  Wow...it's actually  kind of depressing.  I always kind of thought the idea of blogging was kind of egotistical and arrogant, and browsing verified this belief.  (A friend of mine also reminded me of this just the other day.)  "Hey, look at me!  I have somthing interesting to say!  And if not, I can say something mundane in a very provocative way because I'm the most original thinker and writer!"  I mean, some of us title our blogs "A daily reminder of how clever I am."  Then with pseudo-humility, bloggers say, "Oh, but no one is probably reading this.  Who would want to read my drivel?" while they actually thirst and hunger for readership and any sort of affirmation.  So, why blog?  It's because I have very interesting things to say.  And if I'm having a slow day, I'll talk about something mundane in a creative way because I am so clever and am such a great writer.  I'm different from all those other bloggers, and I need to remind us all daily of how clever I am.

         Abercrombie and Fitch is a terrible store.  Their catologs are pornographic, they have half-naked people greeting you at the door, it's over-priced, etc.   Plus, they play music in the store so friggin' loud...how can anyone shop in there?  They've also had issues with offending minority groups.  Everyone should boycott...unless they're having a sale, then it's okay to shop there.  I mean, I own two Abercrombie shirts, having gotten both on sale.  See, it's like I'm stealing from them by only getting sale items, right?  Ha ha...suckers.

       I don't really like econometrics, but I do have an incentive to pursue it at some level in my career.  The main payoff I see is having an estimator named after me.  Specifically, discrete choice models have cool names and are named after the founders.  Tobit, named after Tobin.  Heckit, named after Heckman.  Leeit??  That sounds kind of dumb.  So I was thinking maybe Shoveit.  Or Dammit.  Ok, maybe I'm the only one who sees the humor in this.

       Word on the street has it that a prospective Duke political science grad student got a link to this blog.  I don't think that's such a great idea, but whatever.  If this is you, welcome, and come to Duke.  That way, you can hit Scotto for giving you the link to my blog.  Or don't come, and I'll hit Scotto myself for giving you the link to my blog.

       What a tiring couple of days.  We had prospective political science phd students visiting.  We had to put on a good show.  And what a good show it was.  We had lots of nice food and drinks, watched Duke get to the Elite Eight, and did some keg stands.  I think the keg stands clinched it for a few prospectives...but which way it swayed their decision, I'm not 100% sure.

       Apologies again to my avid readers for spotty updates to the most exciting place on the internet.  I saw Coach K in the gym yesterday.  I told him he was lucky that Wisconsin lost in the second-round because I had them playing Duke in the finals.  I said I picked Wisconsin to win, and he said "Then they probably would have.  But they won't have the chance."  I agreed, and we went our separate ways.  More exciting news.  I think I'm going to unionize the TA's at Duke.  Health insurance premiums are jumping up 30% next year, and there are oodles of other issues affecting graduate students, who have little real influence on many of these important issues facing the university and its grad students.  The TA's disdain to concel their views and aims.  They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing university conditions.  Let the Administration tremble at the TA revolution.  The TA's have nothing to lose but their chains.  They have a world to win.  TA'S OF DUKE UNIVERSITY, UNITE!

       I've taken this past week off from pretty much everything...including updating my blog.  What a spring break!  Actually, probably my most uneventful spring break ever.  Biggest event was some oral surgery.  Not a great experience.  So, it's time for March Madness again.  Wisconsin totally got the shaft.  A 6 seed?!!  Unbelievable.  This whole "Big Ten is having a down year" has been blown way out of proportion.  The top teams in the Big Ten are really good, and I think all three will surprise people in the tourney, even though they'll have tough match-ups from their bad seeds.  On the plus side, Wisconsin plays their first two games in Milwaukee....although Milwaukee is a trashy town.  Yuck.

       It has happened again.  Just saw a guy with a Wisconsin t-shirt on here on Duke campus.  I also happen to be wearing my red Wisconsin t-shirt today.  I screamed, "Go Badgers!"  And again, no response.  He just walked on by.  I can't let these small set-backs deter me.  As long as I have my voice, I will go on yelling, "Go Badgers!"

       I thought of the best paper title late last night.  I wrote a totally crappy paper, ripping off from some economics model, for my Congress seminar.  The only saving grace for the paper is the title.  "Going Once, Going Twice, SOLD! The Committee Assignment Proces as a Full-Information, Symmetric, All-Pay Auction."  If you know anything about auctions, don't laugh...I know that is a stupid idea, but my knowledge of auction theory is a bit limited at this point.

       Dude, I've totally changed.  If anyone ever accuses me of that, I really can't argue against that.  I always thought I'd be...the same cool and suave guy that I am.  But I just don't know anymore.  What brought about all this doubt?  Well, I've always had a special place in my heart for Miller Genuine Drafts.  I thought it was my favorite cheap beer, but I just don't know anymore.  Have I sold out?!  Has my taste "developed"...becoming "more refined"??  Is this what it means to "grow up"??  So many questions (along with words "in quotes"), but nowhere to turn to for answers...

       What's up, ya'll?  Just a few more days until I'm done for the semester!  Boo-yah.    Mad props to the Teaching Assistants Association (TAA) up in Madison.  If you haven't heard, they're on strike, just through today.  But then the cool part comes next - the "grade strike" for the very end of the year.  Basically, TA's aren't going to turn in any grades for the classes they are teaching.  That's awesome.  More power to them.    It's surprising how much whining is going on my the undergrads up there though.  They say they support the TA's but think it's unfair that they have to be negatively affected.  Ok, so then don't strike?  Then it's unfair that the TA's have to put up with being unfairly treated.  It's not the TA's fault.  It's the University administration's and state legislature's fault.  Blame them, not the TA's.  Without the TA's (at a big research university, such as Wisconsin), the University is NOTHING.  So in the long-run, undergrads will also benefit from better conditions for TA's.  At this point, it's become a blame game, and the TA's seem to be losing that battle, unfortunately.  As far as the progress of unionizing here at Duke...nothing new to report.  Things should start moving this summer.  And in the end, we may decide that unionizing would not be best for us here.  I think we need a "Task Force" to look into the unionizing issue.  I've always wanted to create a task force.  Sounds so professional and organized...ironically two things I'm not.

       Well well well....we meet once again...my faceless friend.  People still aren't signing the guestbook.  Don't be shy!  Maybe that's my own fault.  Maybe I'm not inspiring you enough, which would naturally lead you to wanting to sign the guestbook.  Hmm...need some inspiring words...  Sorry, I'm all out of inspiration.  I'm just too tired for that.  It's finals week.

       Ok, so a few things.  Wild Bill is back in town for a few days...so, excitement for everyone.  A couple of guys went out tonight...and saw some shady stuff.  There was a "wet t-shirt contest" at one bar.  Everything was so sketchy...the girls, the people there in general...sketchy.  We left pretty quick.  Then we went to Parizades.  It was pretty empty when we got there, but filled up...with Duke athletes.  Horvath showed up.  And Shav.  And a bunch of football players.  Too bad they play on a crappy football team.  And as I was leaving, Chris Duhon, big-shot basketball player, punched me in the face.  Ok, maybe not.  He "inadvertantly" hit me in the throat.  I actually didn't notice it was Duhon, until after Gerry mentioned it right afterwards.  That jerk.  I hope he gets drafted first round.  Then, maybe I can get a million bucks out of it.

       Go to  urlLink www.homestarrunner.com  for some funny stuff.  You'll need sound to enjoy it.  I wish I could be as cool as Strong Bad.  Also so happens that my homepage is down for some reason...thanks to Duke OIT.   urlLink Here  is a particular Strong Bad cartoon that is apt.

       Since Ari doesn't ever update his blog, I'll be the first one to announce in cyberspace that he got a real job.  Way to go, Ari.  Good for you.  You are awesome.  You are the best.  You are a real saint.  But your blog has really suffered.  Where is your commitment and love for the game?  Speaking of game, I'm glad Lefty has finally won a major, winning the Masters.  That's golf, for you uncultured peeps.   Maybe this bodes well for the Sox and Cubs.  I wish one of them will hurry up and win the World Series.  Then maybe we can all finally rest in peace and just end baseball as a sport all together.  I can't think of a more boring sport with a more drawn out season.  And ESPN is just all baseball all the time during the summer.  Their show shouldn't be called "Baseball Tonight."  Last time I checked, that show was on in the morning, afternoon, evening, and late night.  I can't wait until the next strike or lockout.  Those seem to last longer than the official "off-season."

       I can't believe I've lasted this long...or at least my blog.  Today is the 4-month anniversary of "What's Dan Thinking."  It's at a milestone, such as this, that makes me sit and reflect upon all of the things I have been through.  Looking back at my posts, I can really see how I have grown as an individual, dealing with failures and rejoicing in accomplishments.  What a beautiful thing.

       What a sad night.  Duke lost to UConn.  Man, and I just bought a Duke hat the other day...so I bought it for nothing.  What a waste.  Oohh...only an hour and a half until  urlLink daylight savings time .  I think I'm going to keep with the spirit of this glorious holiday by staying up and "springing" my clock forward an hour precisely at 2am...or should I say 3am.  Happy DST!

       Are you hot or not??  Click  urlLink here  to find out!  Ok, this website is absolutely terrible.  That's at least what a few people are saying here in the computer lab.  Although, McIvor was getting pretty giddy rating some of the guys.  I think it's a pretty pathetic site, but it's not harming anyone...except for the ones that get really low scores.  How sad.  What has our society come to, where people seek affirmation through such means?

       Woah...it's been a while since I've been here.  I thought I'd have more time to update over the summer, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  Plus, this summer isn't as exciting as I had hoped, so not much to talk about.  I am auditing an undergrad math course right now.  Wow, what an experience.  I have taken other undergrad math courses while at Duke, but it's different over the summer and with this particular group of people.  It's like high school all over again.  Ahh, to feel young again.  There are a bunch of chatty people in the class, and the prof really likes that.  And he's got a thing for a few of the girls too.  Or maybe he's just extra interested in their academic development.  Riiigght.  The prof told me to shut up the other day.  I think two reasons why.  One, I don't wear a tubetop.  Two, I was whispering quietly to a friend, rather than blurting something out loudly and disrupting the class.  He prefers the latter, since he can hear what you say.  I guess he gets paranoid when he can't hear what I say...which he should.  Seriously, telling students to shut up...can't be good pedagogy.  Oh wait, I've done that to my own students.  The summer should pick up once  urlLink EITM  starts up.  Nothing more exciting than hanging around with a bunch of geeky political scientists for a month.

       I think one can often suffer from one's success.  For instance, if a football program wins several Rose Bowls and sets a very high standard to judge success (such as Wisconsin - GO BADGERS!), anything less is devastating to the fans and the program in general.  Yes, the Badgers have fallen on tough times.  Another example...I was told by someone that I was the best male dresser in the department.  But then I went into school today just wearing a white undershirt and ragged shorts...and felt bad for it.  But there are those days that I just want to be a slob...especially during the summer.  Am cursed by my own keen sense of style?

       I can't believe aspiring Congressmen use blogger.com!  That could be a bad sign...if they are so desperate and cheap that they have to use a blog to get their message across.  Actually, I think Dean had one....oooohhh...nevermind.  I thought blogs were for preteens and unprofessional schmucks such as myself.  Oh, okay...I guess politicians and aspiring politicians qualify.   If you're interested in seeing a real-life candidate blog, see  urlLink this .  This guy believes in "A new way for a new day."  Are you kidding me?!  What kind of nimrod voter will fall for that line?  Okay, I guess I wouldn't be so suprised to see him elected.  It is somewhat catchy...I mean, it rhymes.  "Way" and "Day".  Very clever.  Clever enough to win the war against terrorism...or at least against the Bush regime of "Errorism".  The flag and clouds in the picture also help.  I mean, what's more American than a flag and fluffy white clouds in a bright blue sky?!

       I gotsa question.  Why is it "Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen", rather than "Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen"?  You might think that it would be alphabetical, assuming they do an equal amount of the work.  Maybe Mary-Kate is older.  Another theory has it that if it were the latter, people might think that their names are Ashley-Kate and Mary-Kate, but I think that theory is pretty weak.  The source for this theory might not be so reliable.  I found out that my informant has a long past of illegal activity.  He (or she) would drive around with friends and tear down basketball rims in driveways.  What sick individuals would find humor and entertainment in vandalizing private property?!  Just sick.  I can't believe I live with this felon...ooops... I mean, if I lived with someone who did this, I would be in disbelief.

       Sooo...I'm finally done with finals.  It was a fitting end to a painful year, as I got my butt kicked again.  Man, this past year was one humbling experience.  I found an old buddies phone number and gave him a ring.  If you're reading this John, wud up, sucka'.  As many of you know, I'm going for my Ph.D. and won't get it for several years.

       I would first like to apologize to de Marchi for misspelling his name.  It's with a small "d" and a space in between.  But the rest of the entry stands.  He fights like a girl.  I got to see a really beautiful thing tonight.  It's one of those things that you might experience just once in a lifetime, so I'm so grateful I could experience it tonight.  A hodgepodge of political scientists put aside all of their differences to unite together to support an injured member.  Rather than yell "Shoot her like a horse," or some other taunt, which one might find reasonable for a hobbling German, we all went to the emergency room together in support of our ailing comrade.  All ten or so of us sat in the waiting room for about 4 hours, hoping and praying she would be okay (and also hoping that NSF wouldn't retract our stipends for being stupid enough to play soccer on a completely uneven and bumpy pitch, with two big-ass storm drains, and rocks scattered throughout).  So to recap, Vera might have a partially torn calf muscle and is in crutches, but should be okay...at least until she gets the hospital bill.

       To say DeMarchi fights like a girl wouldn't be too much of a stretch.  First of all, while I wasn't paying attention walking back from lunch this past Friday, he whipped around behind me and put me in a choke hold.  What a wuss...having to take advantage of the element of surprise, rather than face me head-on.  My throat - two days later - still hurts.  Second, our arm-wrestling matches (and the lopsided outcomes) are well-known.  I just arm-wrestled Claire in the computer lab.  Perhaps beating DeMarchi so handily gave me a false sense of security.  I wasn't expecting much of a match from Claire.  But woah.  I hurt my arm arm-wrestling her, and I actually didn't even beat her.  We quit before a winner could be determined.  I had to stop because I was bursting out in laughter from the realization that she is as strong or stronger than DeMarchi.  Ok, it's actually not that funny. Claire is pretty ripped.  But I'm still not too impressed with DeMarchi.

       Given its small size, Duke PoliSci has a diverse faculty.  In fact, we have someone who goes to fight club pretty often.  To see this imposing figure, go  urlLink here .  Anyway, rather than challenge him to an all-out-brawl, we decided to arm wrestle today.  We're similar in height, and he's about 160 lbs and I'm about 150...so should be a good match.  I beat him once, and then we decided to go best 2 out of 3.  Second time, it looks like he's about to beat me, getting a little advantage...That is, until I said "Just kidding!" and then proceeded to slam his hand to the table.  Ha ha.  That was the most fun I've had in a while.

       "Soul suck."  That's how a "friend" described my life after I explained what EITM is.  I can't really argue with that.  Grad school does do a lot of sucking to an individual and his or her soul.  Plus, political science might be a field that soul sucks more than others...at least now that its focus is more and more towards advanced quantitative methodological techniques...which is exactly what I'm studying.  So in essence, I'm part of the problem.  Woah.

       There is absolutely no food available on Duke campus on Sundays (or even weekdays after 7pm).  Sucks for everyone, especially campers stuck on campus without a car.  Luckily, my math class - which i haven't gone to in a week or so - had a review session this evening.  I had a feeling one of the undergrads would order pizza, so I stopped by to steal a couple slices...and indeed, hot pizza was there waiting.  God bless the undergrads.  And of course, I didn't stay for the review session.  I'm not much of a gambler.  In fact, I've always hated gambling and playing cards.  But last night was my night, and now I'm addicted.  The game was Texas hold'em.  Without naming names...Brett had a tough night.  He dipped into his wallet to buy more chips several times.  Camber was fine, since he had the luxury of taking money from his wife, who was kicking out butts.  I still came out okay, more than doubling my money.  Drinks on me!

Perhaps if the price is right, but otherwise, this is my blog and only reflects the thoughts and opinions of ME!  But I have not thoughts or opinions right now, so I'm going to stop.

       A thousand apologies, my dearest friends.  I have been careless and reckless by not tending to my blog.  The busy-ness of this summer has officially increased with the arrival of  urlLink EITM .  If you don't know what it is, you aren't cool.  "This one time, at political science camp...."  Oh, the stories we're going to have.  I am the official coffee-guy for the conference.  And let me tell ya, I make a mean pot of coffee.  I'm supposed to make fun of Tof for not auctioning off his gmail account.  What a loser.  Doesn't he know about the "American way"?  Do anything it takes to make a profit.  I mean, forget the fact that he got the gmail account as a gift.

       I've put it off long enough.  Ever since last fall semester ended, I've been to afraid to look at my TA evaluations for the American gov't course I TA'ed.  It was my first time TA'ing, and it wasn't the best experience.  I had a busy semester and put little thought and preparation into the classes.  I'd usually just wing it.  Anyway, I just took a peek at my evaluations, and they were fine.  Basically, I got a 4 out of 5.  If I scored any higher, that just means I put in too much time and effort in the class.  Ha ha.  Funny, right?  Comments ranged from "Dan is a good guy" to "Dan led awesome discussions."  Yes, my students did learn something.  They learned how awesome I am....the most important lesson one could learn.

       For those of you who don't know, Duke University kind of sucks.  The University doesn't believe in holidays.  We don't get Labor Day or Memorial Day off, which is kind of nutty.  In Wisconsin, those two holidays are worthy of a glorious celebration in the form of the  urlLink World's Largest Bratfest .  I didn't go to class yesterday (Memorial Day) anyway...in protest.  I tred to muster some support for an active protest, but the people in my department are even more politically apathetic than me.  I wanted to protest by holding signs that say "Never Forget."  In the end, we were all too lazy, so we just sat on our butts in the computer lab.

                    This past&nbsp;Monday, I drove up to Harrisonburg, VA to help Ari move in.&nbsp; Tof came along to help as well.&nbsp; We unpacked surprisingly fast, and Tof suggested we drive back down to Durham that evening.&nbsp; It did sound like a good idea, since I liked the idea of sleeping in my own bed and had work to do the next day.&nbsp; But I had to remind Tof that our job wasn't finished.&nbsp; Sure, we had finished the physical move, but the emotional move had yet to be completed.&nbsp; We couldn't just drive up with Ari, help move in, and then abandon him right away.&nbsp; So, we stayed the evening, had a few drinks, and watched an Iron Chef episode.&nbsp; The next morning, only then having fully accomplished a successful move, Tof and I drove back.

In other news...I don't think I chronicled the crappiness of my travel experiences to and from Chicago a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp; I mentioned my flight being delayed out of RDU.&nbsp; The plane eventually took off.&nbsp; When we were within 50 miles of ORD, we were put in a "holding pattern" for about 40 minutes.&nbsp; What sucked so bad was that there was constant turbulence during the "hold."&nbsp; I had to have the barfbag right by my side ready to go.&nbsp; Luckily I didn't have to use it.&nbsp; On my way back home, my flight was cancelled.&nbsp; Still don't know why.&nbsp; I guess the sky was a&nbsp;little too hazy or whatever.&nbsp; So, I got on the next flight out.&nbsp; And then that flight got delayed an hour.&nbsp; The point of this story is that ORD sucks, and now the FAA has caught on.&nbsp; In a CNN story, the FAA calls O'Hare delays unacceptable.&nbsp; Go&nbsp; urlLink here  for the scoop.

       It might be time to think of a cooler name for my blog. I just don't know if "What's Dan thinking" quite cuts it. Sounds so generic. Sounds so boring. And it is kind of sad to read this blog and really believe it is what I'm thinking. I mean, it obviously is what I'm thinking for the few minutes I type it up. But outside of these precious few minutes spent typing up my blog...is it really what I'm thinking? I hate to think I'm so shallow. There are better blog titles out there. For instance, go  urlLink here .  &nbsp;  Fehrsey made me watch Super Troopers this evening. I've never watched it before - mainly because it totally looks stupid. But I thought I'd be a good roommate and friend by watching it with him. It started off stupid, but built up momentum and finished with a flurry. I think it got funnier and better as I got to know the characters better and became more emotionallly invested in them. I also think drinking a couple of beers facilitated this emotional connection. Whatever the case, it went from stupid to stupid-funny, so I give it a thumbs almost up.

       Ahh, it's nice to be back in the Midwest.  At the moment, I'm in Dekalb, Illinois - home of Cindy Crawford.  I'm not sure if there is a museum here in her honor, but I'm going to find out.  You won't believe where I was last night!  I went to the Madonna concert in Chicago.  Wow, what an experience.  It was maybe as exciting as going to an N'SYNC concert a few years back.  I also saw the movie "Before Sunset" this weekend.  It was quite good - better than I thought it'd be.  You should really go see it.  It's the sequel to "Before Sunrise", which was set and filmed nine years earlier.  It might seem like a "chick flick", but it's not really...so don't let that deter you.  Ok, until next time...take care of yourself and don't forget to put down the toilet seat.

       Welcome to my blog - Terminal Edition.  My flight to Chicago has been delayed 2 hours and 20 minutes so far.  I'm just killing time at the "Triangle Cyber Cafe."  I was actually craving a burger, but there is absolutely no food at RDU.  There isn't even a McD's.  So I had to settle for a roast beef and cheddar sandwich.  Being so bored here, I've occupied myself by nursing two beers over two hours.  Now I'm done with that and don't want to drink anymore.  There's nothing worse than a drunk airline passenger.  In other news, EITM is over.  It hasn't quite hit me yet.  It probably won't hit me for a few days.  I'll give a good summary of how EITM has changed my life in a couple days.  I just need to let it all settle in first.  Vera informed today of how there was a lot of sexual tension built up between EITMers.  I didn't notice it.  How can there be sexual tension between poligeeks?  Anyhoo, I'm going to go back to sitting in the airport with nothing to do.  This sucks.  I could be in Chicago having a good time right now.  Or I could be at Aldrich's eating 'za and drinking beers with EITMers.  Or maybe it's for the best to avoid all the "sexual tension."  There doesn't seem to be too much of that here in the terminal.

       Brett Benson has been sorely missed at EITM.  He was the "smart" TA.  His depth of knowledge and perceptiveness can be summed up by an email passage he wrote, which reads:  "btw, dan, the camara flatters you.  everytime i catch a glimpse, i can't believe how awesome you are!"  Well said, well said, my astute friend.  Also, in case you're wondering what wallpaper I have on my computer at the moment, go  urlLink here .

"My Best Friend"  I don't know what's going on. All the coefficient signs are wrong. Well, at least they're not statistically significant. 'Cause that'd really suck.  Understand?  No, I can't.  **Chorus Trying to make sense of this crazy world. An uncontrollable experiment. Problems all making my head hurt. All to my detriment. **  Omitted variable bias. That's one problem I won't miss. Heteroskedasticity is such a big pain in the ass I got to fix it fast.  Chorus  Well, my good friend, Mr. Stata. Please help me with my data. Mr. Stata, where have you gone? Please don't let me down. Have I done you wrong?  Have I done you wrong? Mr. Stata, where have you gone? I don't know what's going on.

       If you were lucky enough to be at the McKelvey conference, you were lucky enough to see my blog on a BIG SCREEN.  One - such as Tof - might think that seeing it on the big screen would make the experience better...much like watching your favorite action flick or a football game.  However, some things are best experienced in the privacy of one's home.  I really think reading my blog is a personal experience.  I know I strive for such an effect.  I always write each entry with the hope of connecting with each and every reader at a one-on-one level.  So in reality, reading it on a big screen in a large group cheapens the experience for everyone involved.  Way to go, Tof.

        Welcome to the 4th of July edition of my blog.  I'm frantically typing to make the midnight deadline, but I think I'm going to miss it.  Ok, just passed midnight.  So now, welcome to the 5th of July edition of my blog!  I guess not quite as exciting.  What is exciting is Greece winning the Euro Cup.  The country's biggest claim to fame before this accomplishment was probably the success of a television character of name "Uncle Jesse."  Some EITMers and I went to Raleigh for the fireworks.   We're all about the three F's.  Fun, fireworks, and funnel cakes.  We had two out of those three, which ain't too shabby.  There was some discussion of a fourth F, but I'll stick with just those three.

      If things don't work out at Duke, I'll probably apply to  urlLink CGNU .

      I have a secret admirer. I found in my mailbox at school today a package from Amazon.com, which was quite curious considering I didn't order anything. I opened it up to find Hamilton's time series analysis book. That is one big book. I think it's bigger than the bible. Oh, I guess it's not from a "secret admirer", since the invoice had the name of the person it was billed to...so I guess just an admirer. Jim, thanks for the book!  There was an excellent episode of 7th Heaven on the other day. It discussed the dangers of addiction to drugs - actually just stimulants, such as caffeine from coffee. I mentioned it to Bruno (an authentic Brazilian). Of course, he loves coffee and thinks coffee-addiction...I mean coffee-consumption...should start at an early age (say 2nd grade). Ok, that's not true. Anyway, his reaction to the "moral" of the episode wasn't nearly as violent as I had expected/hoped.  Speaking of 7th Heaven...I had an exciting time at church the other day. I went to the Sunday school class for the first time at this one church I've sporadically attended the past year or so. It was kind of funny, because I don't think anyone in the class works full-time, and I was also the youngest person by far (by about 30 years). I'm almost certain that every other person was retired. It was either go to that class or to the married couples class. They were all so sweet...and old. I think I'll be going back next week.
