        Well today was okay..Miserable for the most part and the weather being so foggy and cold didnt help. I love fog dont get me wrong...but cold...well sucks.     I've been in a pretty bad mood lately. Maybe I'm just sick of people....not I know for a fact I'm just sick of people. Everyone seems to be making me so angry lately. Im turning into an anti-social as we speak.       &nbsp;   I freaked out on Jerky and Tim last night... I didnt mean to...well I did....well I don't know. I was just so mad! Like they'd say the most minute thing and id fucking flip buddy. Jerky was teasing me so I went rank. And Tim was well I unno what tim was doing but it pissed me off anyways. I got all mad and stuff when he said that when he got back he wanted to meet me and stuff. I was like well you'll be like oh what a fucking loser she is...GUESS IM NOT GETTING ANY TONIGHT. Because well...I don't know I guess sometimes he comes off to be a slut. Because I don't know. I guess I don't really trust him as much I thought I did because I just think he wants something out of me...you know? It pissed me off. And then he said something about walking 6 blocks just to talk to me on messenger. Cause hes in like Paddington or something. I was like well you walked 6 blocks to check your fucking email! You of all people should know by now that Im not fucking worth spending any time over let alone walking 6 blocks. He started to like deny it and i just signed off..     Guys really bother me lately. Especially guys who I haven't know like FOREVER. Like robert and calvin and mark. They're cool. But it's like people I don't know as well. I flipped out on Sean arndt last week. And now I think he and Evan (guy I kinda like) hate me now. WHICH REALLY REALLY SUCKS!       &nbsp;   No wonder people hate me so much...Im such a bitch. hahaha. No Im not a bitch...Im the bitch.       &nbsp;   I really miss talking to Joey. Like before he was dating Kaley. He was so easy to talk to. You know the type. Always listens always gives great advice makes you smile when you cry and always has the shoulder to cry on. But after he and Kaley started going out we totally grew apart and now Im completely lost inside of my own head!He was the only person that could make me feel like I wasn't going crazy. It was like I was making sense or something...I have no clue. He saved my life too. But thats a different story for another day..       &nbsp;   I'd love to talk to Mike too. He and I were really close before and than he kinda moved because of...umm...life challenges and we'll leave it at that. SoI'm feeling pretty alone right now. I know I totally have people that care about me and stuff but it's not the same...you know?       &nbsp;   Damn I'm such a freak.I think my life is rough when they're kids out there whose parents abuse them, or have no money or clothes or food. I mean I could be off so much worse than I am.. Im just a giant ball of teen angst and depression..I mean I swear sometimes I think Im really losing my freaking mind!!       &nbsp;   Gotta love life...Natures the only nice thing out there.And even that we're destroying. Fuckin hell eh? I mean why the hell are we here what is are bloody perpose...I swear. Technology is killing us as cool as it is. In a lot of ways it royally sucks moster cock.     Well anyways...Ive got stuff to do....well not really...but I have nothing else to say     Bye
