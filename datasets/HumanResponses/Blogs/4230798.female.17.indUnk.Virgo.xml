       in the process of dyeing my hair.. sis doing it for me.. i can really sae that she is QUITE clumsy.. QUITE..      let me recall.. ah.. went to sch really early todae.. joined rai who was already there and when i went in with my sis, we found that she was sleeping.. smuggled some breakfast for her.. was really aware and alert for show-me-your-student-pass woman.. haha.. serious.. u never know where her head and devilish face will be popping out next, hands stretched out.. waiting for you to surrender your student pass and.. get booked.      todae's paper was quite okay.. can actually leave early.. but i checked and re-checked the paper.. hope i can pass though..      went to j8 in the hope of buying my shoes.. my size was unavailable though.. couldn't hide my disappointment.. tried other branches.. all gone except parkway which still has my size.. but it was the last pair on display.. reserved it in advance.. manager will call me if new stock arrives.. i hope it's coming really soon!!      went to meet cherisse and aug in the evening.. passed me my bdae pressie and i passed her herz.. got her a pair of earrings.. hope she likes it! she got me a really nice pink and shiny and glittery notebook and lotsa glittery hair clips.. my girl.. she can really remember that i like shiny pinky stuff!! lol... thanks babe man!      tmr's my poa paper.. wish me luck ehz.. going school early to practise and get prepared as well.. really hope i can get my shoes also.. a pair of brand new one..      and at a discount!

       got a really bad sore throat.. cant even curse and swear!      woke up at 7 plus todae.. paid respects to my ah gongs.. not alot of ppl at the temples.. so it was quite fast.. ate lots for breakfast.. so i skipped lunch..      watching li jia wei's fighting for bronze.. that korean woman's way of spinning the ball is really unique.. seems like jia wei's in for it.. think that korean woman is testing jia wei's patience.. she's taking a slow strategy against her.. i do hope that jia wei does not lose her patience.. glory to singapore!    she's won the first round!

       been studying and working like sh*t..       met a barbaric customer todae.. her feet is SO SMALL!!! i think size 3 wouldn't even fit her.. nevertheless i asked her to give it a try and she was like so pissed off.. her feet was just too small (shop having sale like nobody's business.. BIG TIME SALE u see?).. so i THINK she vented her anger on me (which is no use) and asked if i really have found the SMALLEST sizes possible.. i mean.. why wouldn't i try to find?! i want to sell the f**king shoes as well!! haha.. then u noe wad? the next thing i saed just came out of my mouth.."why don't u try the shop opposite? they might have sizes for u.." well, if anyone came to j8.. they should have noticed that BATA is just opposite the shop i'm working at.. and they sells shoes.. for kids as well..      glad that my manager didn't get that.. as well as the customer.. she was like.. dumbstruck.. din understand me.. =0      tmr off day.. think will spend the day resting or something.. probably go get my pressie from benjy! he's such a nice boy.. got me my CD!! hafta study tmr.. macro test on mon.. wonder how i will do.. shall go thru all the tutorials again.. think my tutor gave a big hint liaoz.. if i dun heed her advice i'll might as well go bang the wall.. hope peck will have a nice day working tmr.. probably meet her and study in the evening..       if i'm not wrong i should be able to get my paycheck somewhere next week.. cant wait.. so many things to buy.. but hafta save for a rainy day as well (duh..) gotta get myself a really nice perfume (not that i have body odour or something).. and maybe some cosmetics..      getting fat.. been eating lotsa swensen's.. and i say it again.. it's really A GOOD DEAL!!      hope everyone's been happy and studying really hard ok? wish ya luck!

        i never believed in fridae the 13th until yesterdae.. my alarm rang at 6am (i had a lesson at 8am).. i went back to sleep, thinking tt i SHOULD be able to wake up 5 mins later.. and yes, i woke up (like duh!).. i happily took my contacts and stuff to go into the bathroom.. and i took a glance at the clock.. my eyes went like BLINK! holy shit! it was already 7am and i was like supposed to be out by then?!      after bathing i cheong to the lift.. in the lift i checked my bag for the usual stuff : wallet.. bottle.. keys.. umbrella.. and oh shit. my hp! ya you're right, i ran back to my house and grabbed it.. and went back into the lift again.. tried to switch it on but it showed "RECHARGE BATTERY"...      i gave up on my hp so i went (ok.. 'ran') to the bus stop.. luckily for the dae, the only non-unlucky thing was tt the buses came consecutively after i alighted the bus... reached class at about 8.05am and pushed open the door.. only to find that there's only 4 ppl in the class.. teachers should be more punctual.. !!!!      was listening to the teacher when i took a glimpse at my feet.. i realise tt i wore the wrong pair of my slip ons~! my left foot was wearing my sis's, while my right foot was wearing mine (we both have the same design and colour)!! right.. sounds dumb.. hers is size 6 while mine is size 7.. hers looks new and mine has holes...      i've never had a day like this before.. how much more suay can i get?
