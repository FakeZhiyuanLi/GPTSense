      I have start a thing called STG(Save The Goldfish) it like Hermione's house elf thing, the poor things, she's right they should have rights too! So if you can save as many goldfish as you can afford, they cost $0.28 plus tax so it's $0.30 total each. They will die and not have had a real life to live. If you don't help them, you will be haunted by the Spirit of the Goldfish tonight at 12 O clock and it will show you the horrible way that goldfish are treated in the evil labs of the Wal-Mart corporation. Save them or else...

      The Goldfish Sanctuary is currently running a campaign against Walmart stores for their atrocious treatment of all kinds of fishes. Please do not buy fish or supplies from them - in fact, we strongly suggest that you boycott the store altogether. What follows is more information on this campaign.  ATROCITY against FISHES: Walmart Stores GFS members from across the US have told horror stories about the terrible treatment fish receive at Walmart. Fish are forced to live in filthy water, dead fish and diseased fish abound in the tanks, and fish are overcrowded. Often, fish are kept with other incompatible species, and goldfish are indiscriminantly mixed with tropicals. My local Rochester, New York Walmart's pet department is dark, ill-lit, and not supervised. To obtain help, one must seek an employee out. Seeing the fish literally die before my eyes, suffering in these terrible conditions, is revolting. No animal should ever be treated this way, allowed to suffer endlessly until its inevitable death. According to Mr. Greg Bickal, Chapter Head of the Iowa Goldfish Sanctuary: "I would like to complain about Walmart. Dirty fish tanks with diseased fish. I recently bought 2 red-capped orandas and a calico fantail from them. Or should I call it RESCUED. If I would have left them there, they surely would have died within a week." D. Catham, head of our Texas chapter has this to say: "Another very bad fish abuser and seller, at least in this area, is Walmart. In this area, Walmart is far worse [than Petsmart], if that is possible. I frequent the fish department every time I go to that store, find absolute carnage, and then I find someone in the department, and COMPLAIN LOUD AND LONG! Walmart SHOULD NOT BE IN THE LIVE FISH BUSINESS. If their conscience is not bothered by the gross cruelty of keeping fish long enough to kill them there or send them home with a poor, unaware customer to die and/or spread disease to that customer's home tanks(not one tank is disease free)..." Walmart, the nationwide discount department store, is known to mistreat their fish, an active party to their suffering. Walmart should simply NOT BE SELLING LIVE FISH.

(including the crookshanks theory.) I agree with ursula after looking at how stupid my post was. It is hagrid. just to show that I come from the stupid idea family, my dad thinks it is draco, see evidence against it in sirius black theory disevidence.my mom has no theory. if you wish to throw things at me, be my geust.@@ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0  my apologys for my last post

      The half blood prince is...................................................................................................................... Harry himself. before there are any angry replys, listen. James was pureblood, lily was muggle born. This may seem like a crazy idea, because the title reads hp  AND  the half blood prince, not HP&nbsp; the  HBP. But think on that awhile, it might have some credibility. If not, URSULA PLEASE DONT COME AFTER ME WITH SHARP STICKS/SCARY ROCKS(c) meg, 2004

      hello potter fans, I was just invited a couple of hours ago, and only then did I log on.&nbsp; I wanted to test out bloggers features and was glad I was finally part of a blog. My special thanks to Ursula for inviting me. Note, If you dont fell like it, you dont have pay any attention to my posts for awhile, I dont quite know what you are talking about, but I will catch on.

      Alas my theory has been proven wrong. JK said on her site that Tom is not the HBP. But it might have been before she said this. Our list of suspects grows shorter my friends. Check the FAQ section of JK's site she updated it. She says that the HPB is something that Harry find out about in CS. Maybe Godric Gryffindor could be the prince.

      This is to make up for the entirely too serious nature of my last post:   urlLink Harry Potter fanart!!  Squeeeee!  This girl is everybody's favorite fanartist. Because she uses pretty colors. And cool poses. And she draws Lupin without his evil moustache. (It's  evil  I tell you!)   I especially like The Marauders, mostly due to James' hair and Peter's shoes (odd, because I hate them both). But my all-time favorite is Neville Longbottom. Aieeeeeee! The cuteness! *adores*  Ahem. So, go look around, and be sure to sign Ayne's Dreambook before you leave. And if anybody else knows a good fanart site, leave it in a comment.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go adore Neville some more.

      Check it out:  urlLink this article  presents our three major candidates (Dean, Tom, and Hagrid). Y'know, only the arguments are better. I think it's interesting that people are having the same ideas as us. Oh, and  urlLink this one  is just about Hagrid.  Interestingly enough, both articles were released FIVE DAYS after I presented my theory. Maybe this is just a coincidence, but I like to think that I thought of it first. ^_^  Then again, don't take it all seriously. There are several completely bogus theories floating around. For example, some people are saying that maybe Colin isn't  really  a muggle-born. That Petunia is  actually  a Squib, and therefore Dudley is a half-blood. Maybe Snape, despite having been an evil nasty Slytherin, isn't  completely  pureblooded. And my personal favorite: Ron and Hermione's firstborn son. *dies* (Check out  urlLink The Burrow  for more theories.)  Oh, and the reason I didn't mention Mark Evans?  urlLink Lookit.

      Toward the end of GoF, when Harry is telling Dumbledore about how Voldemort has returned, and used Harry's blood, etc., Harry fancies that he saw a 'gleam of something like triumph' in Dumbeldore's eye.  What could it mean?

      I was at Lena's looking at hair magazines and we came up with this new, improved list, which we, at least, like better.  If you don't like it, leave a comment and I'll ignore it. Here you go. Ursula: Eloise Midgen (she seems innocent enough, but seeing as how we've never met Eloise...  Mostly we chose her because we think she's very nice and smart on the inside.  We wouldn't know.  We also think she's a Hufflepuff.  Honestly, cursing off her nose, she can't be a Ravenclaw.  Another thought was Alicia Spinnet, and another was Susan Bones.) Jonathan/Shine: Oliver Wood (all sports people are at least a little fanatical, aren't they?  And, um, we had another reason but I won't put it, it's kinda, um...squeeish is I think the best word for it.  We also considered Terry Boot and Anthony Goldstein, who are both Ravenclaws.) Meg: Nymphadora Tonks (Lena said it, I agreed.  Though I also think I've more than a bit of uncanny resemblence to Hermione Granger, but that's just me...  I also said Angelina Johnson.  Can you believe it took me two fanfics and about twelve minutes to remember her last name?) Lena: Lavender Brown (I already said, her bunny.  And we had already said that David Koh, her hubby, was a bit like Seamus Finnigan.  We also thought about Parvati/Padma Patil, leaning toward Padma.) Abe: Neville Longbottom (I cannot disagree with Ursula here.  At least you don't step on my feet at the contras.  We had another Neville, too, a boy named Tom who is distinctly pigeon toed.  We didn't really think of anyone else for Abe.) Garrett: Terry Boot (Terry is a conundrum, wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in a pastry, wrapped in a lie.  Or perhaps not so pastry-covered, but he's only mentioned a few times, and Lena doesn't know Garrett at all, and it just seemed to fit.  We also considered Terry for Shine, and we talked about Theodore Nott for Garrett, but this is our final decision.) I don't know Jaceson, so I really can't say, so I put: Jaceson: Nameless Hufflepuff (There is nothing wrong with Hufflepuff, it just has a bad name, just as Slytherin does.  At least you're not Peeves.  Oi, Peeves!  Changed my mind, Garrett can be Peeves, Jaceson, whoever you are, you can be the enigmatic Terry Boot.  He's a prefect, that's a plus.) Anie: Katie Bell (She's quiet, she does all those sports, and she goes for older guys.  But you don't know that, okay?) Okay, I was going to put the rest of my list but it's all people you don't know, I think, so I won't.  Most of them were very true, though.  Lots of Slytherins.  Who, of course, just have a bad name, like Hufflepuff does.

      I am of the personal belief that Tom Riddle is the prince. This may confuse you but hear me out. I know Jo said it is neither Harry nor Voldemort, but Tom Riddle is not really Lord Voldemort. Remember in OotP, in Dumbledore's office after Harry had the dream about Mr. Weasley, Dumbledore does something with a jar, and a snake comes out. Then he says," Yes, but in essence divided." Well I'm thinking that he is talking about Riddle and Voldemort being one, but also that they are two very different beings. This is one of my theory's. Although I think it could be many other characters, this is my choice.

      This is strange, very very strange...thank you, Abe or Ursula or whoever, but... Now:  The Moment Of Truth Disclaimer:  I can't believe I didn't think of this before, but it's not exactly my idea.  I mean, I hadn't thought of this guy until a few months ago, when I read On Your Mark, but I didn't get the idea of him being the Prince until like seven seconds ago.   So, here you are:  MARK EVANS!!!!!!!!!!!  Of course!  It's so simple, really I should have thought of him beofre.  It just came to me, when I was commenting on a comment on a comment on a comment on something I said about Dean.  Do you remember Mark?  He's all new, he was only mentioned once in OotP.  The guy who cheeked Big D?  He was beaten up?  But he's got the same last name as Lily, so he could be like one of Harry's long-lost cousins.  He could even be illigit, so Dumbledore wouldn't know, maybe, and he could be half blood, probably would be if he's related to Lily, she's Muggleborn, and...I cannot believe I didn't think of this earlier.

      The "If we were all Harry Potter characters, we would be..." list. Hee. I just wrote what sprang to mind, so don't kill me if you don't like what you got.  Meg = Luna Lovegood  Abe = Neville Longbottom  Jonathan = ? (Can't think of anything. Ideas welcome.)  Ursula = Lily Evans (From the flashback in book 5.)  Garrett = Fred and/or George Weasley (They're interchangeable; take your pick.)  Jaceson = ? (Again, no clue.)  Bwahaha.  NOTE: Though Meg and I both somewhat resemble Tonks, I decided that I am more like Lily and Meg is  definitely  Luna.  OTHER NOTE: I honestly couldn't think of anything for Jonathan or Jaceson. If nobody has any ideas we can say Jonathan is a long-lost Weasley cousin and Jaceson is Hermione's evil twin. (If you do, in fact, have an idea, please leave a comment.)  OTHER OTHER NOTE: Yes, Abe, Neville. Don't know why, really, it's just what I thought of and I think it fits. Besides, Neville is the best!  OTHER OTHER OTHER NOTE: No, most of you don't know who Jaceson is. He's a Mabel-schooler who is very fun to annoy, and he's gone to Speak-Out but he's never really said much. (He's antisocial... maybe he's Filch?) (This is me annoying him.)

      I know, it's where all the wizards/witches go to catch the train, but just students and their families.  I rather fancy Number 12 Grimmauld Place, seeing as how that's where the Order meets, and where Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, etc. talk about important stuff, like being possessed and the Weapon, and all.  And that's kind of what we're doing, except about the books, not in the books.  Though that would be cool, to be in the books...kind of weird, but very cool.  Weird because it'll be eight years ago...did anything interesting happen eight years ago?  I turned six, and the Olympics were in Atlanta, weren't they?  And that's about it...

      Honestly, four times?  I hope you just did that because your computer hates you (that's why I always end up posting things twice), and not because you don't think we'll believe you.  Jo also wrote that she had a whole bunch of stuff about Dean, like his family history, etc. that she was going to put in CoS, but he publishers made her cut it.  I, too, shall quote her: Dean is from what he has always thougth of as a purely Muggle background.  He has been happily raised by his mother and stepfather; his father walked out on the family when he was very young... when the letter came from Hogwarts Dean's mother wondered if his father might have been a wizard, but nobody has ever discovered the truth: that Dean's father, who had never told his wife what he was because he wanted to protect her, got himself killed by Death Eaters when he refused to join them. Summary: Dean is a half blood, and therefore eligible to possibly be The Prince. I don't like that you can't copy things off her site, you have to type it all out.  It's rather annoying.  But still. Jo also said that she was going to have Dean's character develop as the story went on but instead decided to have Neville's character develop, as apparently there wasn't enough room or something for both of them. Have you realized how many half bloods there are in the Potterverse?  Dean, Seamus, Harry, Hagrid, Tom...I'm sure thee's more I haven't even thought about, perhaps Ernie MacMillan or Hannah Abbott...probably not any of the Slytherins, though it is possible...you saw with Tom...really.  I also rather think that it could be Pettigrew, because it doesn't say much about his family, and it'd be an interesting twist...what if it was Snape?  That'd be interesting...I'm of the personal opinion that it is a student, because to me, prince generally denotes 'young' and always denotes 'male'.  But I know, it could be someone older, Prince Charles is still a Prince and he's like, really old.

      If you have been following  urlLink J. K. Rowling's site  as obsessively as I have, you will know that book 6 is going to be called "The Half-Blood Prince". You will know that she is referring to neither Harry nor Voldemort. And you will have speculated. Here's what we have come up with:  * Neville (nope, he's a pureblood) * Colin (he's Muggle-born) * Dean (maybe...but don't you think he'd've had a bigger part beforehand?) * Remus (no clue. he's a werewolf, that *could* be considered half-blood, I guess)  Thankfully, nobody mentioned Sirius. Because if you had I would've been forced to hit you very hard and remind you of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. And of his mother burning him off the family tree for even *consorting* with Muggle-types. Then I would've hit you again.  Now, I believe I have figured out who the half-blood prince is. But first, to back up my case and increase the dramatic tension, I will quote Rowling:  "Certain crucial pieces of information in book six were originally planned for 'Chamber of Secrets', but very early on (first draft of Chamber) I realised that this information's proper home was book six. I have said before now that 'Chamber' holds some very important clues to the ultimate end of the series. Not as many as six, obviously, but there is a link."  Now I would like to remind you that the term 'half-blood' does not necessarily mean half Muggle and half wizard. I will give you a moment to digest that. And then I will present my theory:  The half-blood prince is Hagrid.  AHA! Hagrid is half giant. He was featured in a vague flashback in book 2. He has a very mysterious past. It's perfect!   This is my theory. My theory this shall remain.  It's a good theory.

      I think your new blog(that's #4 now) is quiet nice, and so are your other three;  urlLink The Geeks , urlLink Beat Around The Bush , and  urlLink A Weird World . But I am a bit disgruntled that I was never told about you other two blogs, other than The Geeks. Also a question if that's ok. Who is Garrett I found is picture,  urlLink Photo  and I know hes a Democrat, that he likes The House of the Scorpion(a plus),the movie Braveheart, and that his email is  urlLink ***************** , AIM address is  urlLink ********* , etc. And if you want me to tell you about Jessica then email me.

      Check it out. A Potter blog. A plog. Let me explain why such a thing is necessary.  1) We keep cluttering up our other blogs with random Potterness.  2) I am going through blog withdrawal and need a support group.  3) Jaceson wouldn't stop bugging me to invite him.  4) With book six on the way, we must speculate like the crazed fanatics that we are.  Neh?   Neh.

      I'm on Chapter Six, and this is what I've got so far.  I've left out the ones that make no sense, though.   Dobby  Lucius Malfoy (would be an interesting twist)  Arthur Weasly  Gilderoy Lockhart  Mundungus Fletcher (just one sentence, but...)  Hagrid (though I hate to have to admit it)  Lee Jordan  Seamus  Dean   I also had Justin Finch-Fletchley and Colin Creevey, saying that though they are Muggle-born, they are also wizards, and so are sort of half-bloods.  Will continue this list when I've read some more.

      I need to reread CoS, and look for hints.  I don't feel like doing it all though.  D'you think I could just read Squeaky's stuff instead?

      Anie is right here with me, so be really nice and friendly to her okay?  Anie, say hi to the nice freaks.  hi  There, now that wasn't so hard, was it?  Now, you know Abe; say hi to Abe.  hi abe  And you know G, say hi to G, and you have to be really nice to him, he's my American hottie.  hi meg's american hottie named G  Good job.  All this switching chairs is annoying.  Have you met Ursula?  Anie, this is Ursula.  Her little sister is really hip.  She's the one who told me to get that book?  Say hi to Ursula.  hey ursula.  nice to meet you.   There, isn't Anie polite?  And you said you might already know Shine.  He's a sex god, so you have to be really nice to him.  And he's German, which is even better.   are you really a sex god?  awesome.  um... are you single, by any chance?  i like the German, sex god type.   Anie!  I thought you were nice.  And we're already running off together, so you can't... yeah.  Hands off.  Please.   Shine, sorry if I sound possessive, and all.... um.  Anyway.  Anie, you know Margie from school--   hi margie.  long time no see.  how have you been?   --and Chandler broke it, so don't bother talking to him.  Ursula's s'posed to have invited some scary person named Jaceson, but he's sort of not here.  So anyway, you've met everyone.  We have to get off now.  Say goodbye.   goodbye, everyone.  it was nice meeting you, maybe.  if this counts as meeting you.   Okay that's enough.  See y'all at school.   see ya  Bye.  bye

      Yay! A JKR banner! Go Abe!  I'm making you a Squeaky banner. Hopefully I'll get it to you before I leave…I'm going to Austin tomorrow.  Does Ayne have a banner? We could link to her too…

      Abe is not l33t. I shall teach him the ways of l33tness. Ph34r m3!!  I will start by re-issuing the invitation.  Meg, you are indeed mad. But in a good way. Optimistic people might say 'quirky'. Pessimists would say... 'beyond help'.  Jonathan has failed to be online for a goodly amount of time. Curse him.

      You may notice that I said that I emailed Abe at 15.36 hours, but the post I posted said I posted it at 3.33 PM.  That is because the stupid bloody clock is now nine minutes behind my computer clock.  And I'm willing to bet (actually I'm not, but if I was, then I would be) that I am posting all this yesterday.

      in our campaign to physically force Abe to become blog-gy.  I sent an email to him today at 15.36 hours, transcript is as follows:  You need to gecome a part of the blog, if you aren't already, so you can contribute to our absolutely riveting conversations.  We need a new angle, and we believe you may hold the key to our success (no, I'm not off talking about the list again).  So, yes, I voted for Ursula to guide you through if you need it (I did) to register, and the rest is pretty straight-forward, and if you can't get the posting part down you should go join a colony of Emperor penguins, as apparently you share their amount of brain cells.  Actually, I heard penguins were pretty smart.  ANYWAY, we must unite in our cause and become one.  All the better to see you with...  I move that we all send variations of aforementioned email to him so that we may force him to become blog-gy.  Something rather like the twelve "you need to post something on the blog"x1000000 emails I sent last Wednesday.  Somebody want to second my motion? *nod your head "yes", someone*

      Because I'm not going to tell you.  At least not right now.  I may wait a few days, to draw out the excruciating pain and agony of suspense.  Wha-ha-ha!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, why was it that your parents are boycotting grapes again Ursula?  It seems an interesting endeavor, and I may aspire to join them in their quest for equality (or whatever). And next Saturday (not tomorrow but the Saturday after that) is a contradance at the Apple Barn in Valle Crucis.  I think we should all go, to show our support for Bohemianism.  Or just because it's fun, that's why I go.

      Ah, DC. 'Twas fun. We made obscene gestures at the White House, aspired to be just like that guy who was camped out front with those peace campaign ads, started a controversy on the bus, then went home, where I greeted my parents, put neosporin on my wounds, and checked my fourteen e-mails (all junk).  Then I posted this. And next I'm going to see if my favorite manga was updated. I have my priorities, you know.  I like STAB ME. Uh... Students Talking About Books.... hm. Mostly Enthusiastically is weak. I can't think of anything for ME.  Bleh.

      Abe says, and I quote:  I don't have the list either, that high school girl has it, or one of the librarians. Ah. Yes. I read the blog, so I know what's happening. A tutorial, and me hi-tech? Bye, ~Abe PS TABASCO is great, it gives the group some spice.  I just tidied up his ATROCIOUS spelling and grammar a bit. By "That high school girl" I assume he means Emily. Also, I thought he was part of this blog? Why does he not post? A mystery...

      Russian has a different alphabet, so that's out.  I did try some other languages: Livro discuta conversa  Portugese   livre discute discussion  French   Buch diskutieren Diskussion  German   libro discute discussione   Italian   boek bespreek bespreking  Dutch   bok diskuterer diskusjon   Norwegian   In bold is the language.  The first word is 'book', then 'discuss', then 'discussion'.  I haven't begun trying to work out acronyms for them because I didn't know what you guys think and also because I'm lazy and don't feel like it.

      Does someone want to find Abe and tell him exactly what to do to become part of this lovely blog?  And, I don't know, give him step-by-step help along the way?  Like the Twelve Step program, except possibly more/fewer steps, and not for anonymus alchoholics.  I'd offer to do it except I forgot how.  I nominate Ursula.  Jonathan, please second my motion.  Unless you'd like to do it yourself. If you want to you can.  It's just that I'd rather not.  I'm in the middle of watching The Office and I don't like to be interrupted.  And besides, it's always fun to make other people do what you don't want to, don't you agree?  Also a book that I just read this week that I think should be put on the List (should it ever be recovered) is  The Beekeepers Apprentice, or On The Segregation Of The Queen  by Laurie R. King.  It is very good.  I like mysteries, especially murder mysteries.  They're so...I don't know, sinister maybe?  Like the Orient Express, that's a good one, if anyone's interested.  And Lena was going to the library today, and said she'd ask about the list.  At least I think that's what she said she'd ask about.  It might have been something else, and if it was I can't remember what.  If she did ask about something else or didn't remember to ask, I'll do it tomorrow when I'm there.  'K?

      That is very odd.  I had to go to my archives thing because I forgot where the blog was so I could create a new post.  If you look, you will find that on Thursday night I posted something with a title that is something along the lines of, "I still think..."blahblahblah"...as one of our links"at 8.07p.  Except I just posted it today, which is Sunday, at about 5.29p.  Odd, isn't it?  So if you want to know what I said (and I will be very hurt if you don't), go look at that.  Anyway, thought you should know.

If we find it, I'll make an Amazon list. T'will be nice and link-y.  I'm posting to draw my attention away from the pretty much skinless area on my shoulder and knee. Two words: Bike Wreck.

(Ha! I can mock people here and nobody can stop me.)  Okay, besides that, I have some questions that I am going to post here in case anybody knows the answer.  1) Where's Abe? Is he MIA or is he just having problems becoming blog-y?  2) Where's the e-mail list? Does Abe have it, or have we lost it already?  3) What are we supposed to do after we find the list?  4) Does everybody have AIM? (I do, and Meg does. Abe can never make his work, and Jonathan wandered off so I don't know about him.) And does anybody know how to do a four-way chat?

      GEEKS doesn't appear to work. We have also ruled out TOMES, BONES, and DINGOES as well.  However, I have added some completely irrelevant links, just to prove I can. Hope you like them.  Meg is using Ks instead of Cs. I have a headache. *Not* a headake.  Still no sign of Abe. He is either not at home or he can't get his computer to work.

      Ooooooooh. Behold, for I have created a shiny new blog.  It will focus on the book group we (me, Meg and Abe) are attempting to create. This is mostly a test entry. It means nothing. Ignore it. Pretend it isn't even here.

      Dear Everyone (U and Shine, but Mostly Shine, because it was His Idea in the First Place), I had a brillo idea.  Or at least I think it's brillo.  You know all those books where it's like people writing letters?  It would be a lot easier for several people (ie, us) to write a book like that than have to meet regularly and collaborate, etc, because we wouldn't necessarily have to agree on everything that happens, because it's more like two (or three, or however many) stories tied together.  And we could have both, the letters and otherwise.  Like write a letter to a character, and also a chapter about what happens in that letter, because at least I don't put every single detail in letters I write.  Do you get what I'm saying?  I'm not sure I'm doing that great of a job explaining it.  And you also asked what time it should be in, and I had a sort of idea about that.  It could be sort of in the future, only to suit our different writing styles or preferences or whatever, the future people could have this program like foreign exchange, only without the exchange part, where they send people to the past so they can learn better.  Wouldn't that be cool?  Think about it, 'k?  L, Meg

      Here's an idea: we don't talk to each other about our characters. We can each write a first chapter ourselves and end it with each person going into a coffee shop (for whatever reason). And then we can work on it together from there (Perhaps in a coffeeshop, for description value. Jimmy's or Tradewinds?) Anyway, but we'd have requirements, to made it harder. The characters all have to feel alienated for some reason. (I could try a gay kid, but I don't know how hard that would be.) It would have to be pretty serious, but there's nothing wrong with a little humor here and there. And past-tense third person, please.  What do you guys think? We could each write a chapter and e-mail it to everybody else, then figure out where to go from there.

      The one where we all write one together.  Also, I almost definitely won't be here for our first meeting *sniffsniff*, I'll be in Kentucky (I've never been to Kentucky before.  It's got a funny name.  It's fun to say.  Kentucky.  Ken.  Tucky.  Kentuck.  Y.  KenTUCKy.  KENtucky.  KentuckY.)  It would be good to do the longer books when we have more free time, in the summer or Christmas break or Easter break.  Mmm...book.  Yummy.  What kind of book did you mean, like one of those scary scifi blow things up books or a regular book?

      Yeah, that'd be fun! We could each write a character and then have them meet and interact. Would also be a nice break from my book that I'm already writing. (I'm almost done with the first draft! It looks like I'll finish before school lets out, w00t! I'm on page 247... go me!)  Oh, and we need to figure out which book to do after House of the Scorpion. I nominate Sabriel, since it's really long and we won't be in school.

      I think this should be one of our links.  It's not exactly relevant to the books, but it is interesting.  And it's not Weebl, which should at least make U happy.  Has Abe joined us yet? http://costofwar.com/

      It still won't let me put links on the sidebar. If you want to see the List, click  urlLink here .  At least I still know basic html. But this lack-of-linky-sidebar thing is really beginning to irk me.

      Hm. The new template doesn't seem to have a pre-made section for links. What little I knew about html has been dashed to pieces too infintesimal to ever hope to repair.  Bleh.  So. I shall fiddle, tinker, and otherwise mess with this strange new template. The worst thing that could happen would involve the blog changing back to orange, so I'm not worried.  Although I quite like the green.  See you guys at Speak Out tomorrow. (The last one! *sniff* *sob*)  *tinker*

      Mabye this will help Abe or help us help Abe,  There were problems with my invitation. What do I do?  A Blogger invitation link will only work once, so if it has already been clicked on, you will need to get a new invitation from the administrator of the blog. If you continue to see problems, please try logging out of Blogger and shutting down your browser (all of the windows) before trying again.   If you use a web-based email account (e.g. Hotmail, Yahoo!, etc.) this may also cause a problem with the invitation link. Sometimes these services modify links to display them within their own site. If this is the case, you'll need to copy and paste the link into its own browser window in order to use it.   Note: Invitations should not be sent to mailing lists, since only one person will be able to accept it.

      Ursula and I were at Carowinds all yesterday and couldn't come to the contra-dance. Sorry! Now, you shall not be frustrated by us not posting. I still have to do Algebra though. I think I'm dead. Can someone check my pulse? Should we not add any of the Redwall Series on the List? I like those. And what about Eragon? I thought that was a good one too. I like medieval swordplay jousty books, like King Arthur. I'm rambling again. I shall go to my doom and do Algebra. "sigh"

      Both list and curses have disappeared.  Curses were not actually bad curses, just like the next time I see you I will spit in your face and stomp on your toes in...erm, possibly Dutch.  And you should be boiled in oil and then toasted over low heat for the rest of eternity in Russian, that type thing.  Anyway, doesn't matter too much, though am upset over loss, as was rather attached to the one where Shine's eyes should turn into olives(perhaps in French).  And went to much trouble to type/post/correct List and has seen fit to reward my efforts by running away.  Bleh.

      Wasn't the one who put up the poster at WHS.  But also there was a flyer type thing advertising it at the library today, so it may have been one of those authority figure type people.   Think Lirael is like a prequel to Sabriel maybe?  Not sure.  Trying to remember, because have read Sabriel.  Think am getting it confused with the Forgotten Beasts of Eld, which also is a good book.  Like the addition of The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  Don't know why didn't think of that first.   Name could possibly be...never mind.  Was going to say WRATH but couldn't make words sound right. Also, wrote out long post cursing Shine several days ago, and it has disappeared.  If found, please return to me ASAP.  Am not offering reward, am hoping will be returned out of goodness of heart. Also Jonathan Hopkins had questions about blog, could you answer them?  Will email address to U eventually.  Not today, as have lost floppy with list on it. My chin itches.

      Yeah, STAB ME is probably not the best idea. I mean, somebody might take it literally. (Besides, can you picture us trying to get a teacher to sponsor that?) TABASCO is still the best.  Also, the name is not important!!  Update: Have changed  Lirael  to  Sabriel , and added the  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy . Do I rock or what?  There isn't much else we can do until we've had another meeting. We don't decide things, we're just tech and publictity.  Speaking of which... we have a poster up at the high school! Meg, was that you? It said SPEAK OUT REUNION. It's über-nifty.

      Very afraid.  Is there a way we could convince Judith, etc. that STAB ME is a nonviolent protest against apartheid?  Or something?  Can we make it peaceful?  So if anyone does come up with another (I won't say a better, because I like STAB ME) name, you know the drill... TELL US !!!!!!!

      Yes, I'm back and I'm sorry to you all. First off, we were at D.C. Then I had to go to a soccer tournament which we lost, although I scored a goal which is amazing(I'm a goalie). Yes Meg, we all love you, but you should learn to fear me because I can't think up anything that would help this book discussion group. Anyway, STAB ME sounds a little bit, how do we say it. FRIGHTENING. Ah, the fear thing again. I don't think the library would approve of this.  I hate the real Tabasco but the acronym is awesome. Come on people, we are all smart. Can't we think some creative title.

      I made an Amazon list and put it on the sidebar. I even added comments! (I'm that good.)  Please note that this isn't in any particular order, and that some of them may change. I'll probably make a new list after this month's Speak Out.  And maybe tomorrow me and Meg can work on designing a newsletter (even more newsletter-y than the last one!).  I'm making progress with Abe. He's a Blogger member, but he still can't seem to join. Will work on that after I finish my math.

      Meg, you rock. This is very very good. I'm not sure what we do now, but at least it's something.  Ah, one thing though. It's generally not a good idea to post peoples' last names and e-mail addresses on the internet, even if it is on a tiny blog that nobody will ever read. So, I am going to copy the List and e-mail it to Jonathan and Abe, then edit out names and addresses.  Yaaaaaaaay for finding the List.

I...HAVE THE LIST!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Well, not the original list, but a copy.  I shall now post the list.  Don't you just love me?

      Yay!  Actually, that Beatle's song (Paperback Writer) in in the form of a crappily written query letter, which is your pitch to the publisher. You can tell because it starts "Dear Sir or Madam, will you read my book..." and goes on to say that it will make them both rich, which as we all know is a bad thing to write in a query letter, so yeah.  So. What have we accomplished thus far?  Well, we came up with a name for our group. Either TABASCO or STAB ME.  What have we yet to accomplish?  We have to make a master book list, create a schedule, send out a newsletter, and have our first meeting in June.  Does anybody else feel intimidated?

      Title pretty much speaks for itself, actually.  You still love me, can't get much more simple than that, really.   La-la-la... [They're] in love with me and I feel fine... Because [they] love [me] and you know that can't be bad yeah yeah yeah [they] love [me] and you know you should be glad yeah [they] love [me] yeah yeah yeah [they] love [me] yeah yeah yeah [they] love [me] yeah yeah yeah  yeah !   Oh, don't you just love the Beatles?  Just like y'all love me...sort of...I'm not four lads from Liverpool singing about writing books...well I do sing about writing books because I like that song, but I am quite obviously not four lads from Liverpool changing the fate of our nation through my/our revolutionary music.  Pity, that.  About changing the fate of our nation through revolutionary music, not about being four lads from Liverpool.  I don't think I should like that, sounds quite a bit uncomfortable.  You know, having multiple bodies, two of which are dead, all that...anyway, I'm rambling again.  That's what happens when you're all alone on a blog while everyone else is having fun in DC and then you go eat quiche (yum) at a fashion show luncheon thing and then you come back and tell people about them loving you and curse them in Russian.  I need to learn Swahili.

        I'm am sleepy. The play Robin Goodfellow(Midsummers Night's Dream) is at the library and I act as Bottom(he is like the donkey in Shek,Shek 2). Costume Crew Chief: Meg.  The  Hitchhickers Guide to the Galaxy  is coming in movie form, link:  http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808404419  . Now I am going to go to sleep. Bye, ~Abe PS The thing on Ursulas shirt(  ) is a real HTML code I don't know what it's for though.

      Yes, I've read the Thief Lord.  It's okay...kind of, y'know, what's it...y'know.  But she wrote another book, Inkheart, that I liked...it was about books.  A book about books.  All her books seem kind of like...oh, like they end too fast, maybe?  Just all, okay everything's good now let's be happy, y'know? Must--read--book--about--German--boys.  Couldn't techinically be called a boy?  Interesting...but still.  All the German boys  I  know are okay, not corrupted or anything.  And cute, too.  But then, seeing as how Shine is the only German boy I know, and he's not actively German, just sort of American-German (We're not in Germany, are we?  No.) so maybe...but still.  Germans are still cool. The only reason I blog more than the rest of you combined is because I talk a lot anyway and you all are the only people I actively communicate with an a regular basis anymore that I'm not related to.  I do write to people, letters and stuff, it's just that the post takes so long these days.  But if no one else blogs then I won't have someone to talk to, so I'll start blogging less and less (or will I blog more and more to make up for the ghostly silence?).  So the only way for me to keep blogging more than you is for you and Shine (and Abe too, isn't he here now?) to blog a little so I don't feel all rejected and alone.  See cause G blogs a lot too but he's not part of this blog so this blog will become all...un-happening. Whatever happened to Shine's writing a book idea?  I thought it was rather a good one...

      I'm staying, I'm just not, you know,  running  it anymore. I thought it should go to you, mostly due to the fact that you post more than the rest of us combined. Ah, bask in the lack of responsibility.  BTW, Meg, I just read Clockwork. German boys all over the place (mostly 'cause it's set in Germany). Pity most of them are cowardly and/or corrupted. Oh, well. The German boy who may or may not be German and couldn't technically be called a boy—he's cool. Eh...it's a Phillip Pullman book. Go read it.  Also the Thief Lord. It's by this German lady, but it's set in Italy. The main dude is German, though! But Hornet's the coolest. Even if she's Italian...and a girl.  Yayness.

Thanks  especially  for always managing to have meetings when I'm not here.  I can tell you  really care .  I'm going to run off with Shine to Germany, maybe, and then I'll take over all the libraries, and then  I'll  set dates for everything, and then I won't miss them.  And I won't miss you, either.  *Sticks out tongue* Ble-egh.

      Hello everybody. I suppose you want to hear about our first meeting?  Well, six people attended, three of whom were librarians. (And none of whom, might I add, were Jonathan or Meg.) We had popsicles and talked about manipulative drug lords and possible paralells between Tam Lin the bodyguard and Tam Lin the fairy sacrifice—you know, from the ballad.  Then we set the date for the next meeting, which I will post as soon as Abe e-mails it to me.  Oh, but here's the exciting part: the Young Adult section just got a huge grant. This means lotsa new books  and  a guest speaker. Like, a famous author type person. I  so  vote  urlLink Tamora Pierce .  I'm trying to cut back on the blogs to make time for my writing, so as soon as I post the date, I am making Meg admin. Be proud, Meg.  And, well, I guess that's all I have to say. See you guys later.

      Hallo. Sorry I didn't post this earlier, but we went out to eat and then something stung me, so I've been rather busy.  Well, today was our second meeting. Five people attended, two of whom were librarians, and none of whom were Meg or Jonathan (again). Oh, and only one of whom had actually finished the book.  So. *cough* Rather ungood in that respect, although it was still great fun. Abe and I ran about the library like mad chipmunks, speculating about odd things like what would happen if gravity suddenly reversed.  Also, we discovered that the Harry Potter song, if hummed very fast, sounds uncannily like an Irish jig. O.o  Mandi was there, and she showed me steps from the contra, which were very spinny and made me dizzy. It seems like loads of fun. When's the next one? Where? Eeee, I want to go!  Meg? Abe? Info, please!

I have to say the book thing today was very fun, more people could have showed up through.  Bye, ~A8e PS the names is a joke to because "A" ete(8) "e", *fake laughing* Ha!

      Book discussion tomorrow! Speak-Out/TABASCO/STAB ME or whatever we end up calling it.  Perhaps BAA. (Bad At Acronyms)  I'm going to be at the library all day, so if anybody is thinking of coming early,  please  do. I haven't seen you guys since...well, since last month's discussion.  And now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go read the discussion book.

      Boy Meets Boy.  *dies*  Okay, first of all, this  author  was who rocked first. Just reading his About the Author page in the back of the book. It went something like  David Levithan was not born in Paris, France or Olympia, Washington. He did not write War and Peace or Babysitter's Club #8: Boy-crazy Stacy. He has not won the Pulitzer Prize, the Newberry medal or the race for eleventh grade vice president. He does not live in Manhattan.  So you see, I just had to read his book.  Unfortunately, I was at the library with my friend Maya and without my card. Did this stop me? Ha! I read the first four chapters while Maya was reading The Raven. Because creepy Poe poems are a lot more difficult to read than teen novels. I slept over at Maya's and then went to my parent's yoga class, and I am aware that you don't care, but it is necessary to tell you this. Why? I left the yoga class for the library and finished the book. So, I didn't  just  read the first four chapters, and I am therefore qualified to leave a long and pompous review.  Ahem.  What I liked best about this was the fact that it wasn't centered on this guy (Paul) being gay. No horrible teen angst. ("Oh,  why  do I have to like boys, why can't I be  normal , what happens when I tell my  parents ?!") Because this town is either present-day and  very  accepting, or it is in the near future when being queer is no big deal. Example: the football captain is also Homecoming Queen. And I'll let you figure that one out for yourself.   So, besides the profound lack of angst, we get some very cute/entertaining side stories, such as Paul coming out to his parents in kindergarten. And running for class president in third grade, his slogan being VOTE FOR ME: I'M GAY! But more importantly, this makes room for the actual romance, and not one of those very tense we-can't-actually-be-going-out-or-we'll-get-beat-up-so-let-us-act-like-frightened-gerbils-if-anyone-gives-us-an-odd-look ones. There are exes. There are dances. There are awkward "meeting the parents" scenes. So (as the title suggests) it is your typical teen romance, except with gay boys. Which is what makes it interesting, neh?  *rereads* Damn, but that was long. Anywho, because I care:   urlLink Author website.    urlLink Amazon page.   It's at the library, guys! Go forth and bask in the fun cuteness. Or, better yet, buy your own copy so David gets the royalties.  Because David rocks.

      has a  urlLink blog .  Not only, that, she has a  good  blog! It's all... random. I mean, far more random than the stuff we've come up with. And she linked to the Meatrix, how cool! Go look! (Oh, and check out her  urlLink book site  too.)  On a completely unrelated note: I finally found a copy of Sabriel! *happy book dance* I was flipping through it while waiting in the car. The little baby is dead...and the necromancer shows up....and we are all on the edges of our seats. "Oh! Whatever will happen next?"   The suspense is killing me. (Note: Ursula is being sarcastic and has in fact guessed what happens next.)  I want coffee. *wanders away*

      Hello, and presenting Books I Read at The Beach.   The Faery Flag by Jane Yolen  A nice little collection of short stories and poems, great except for the title story, which is just like every fairy story ever. I especially like the Making of Dragons, though.   I am the Cheese by Robert Cormier  Eeek. Suspense. I was all jumpy the whole time I read this, which I guess is okay as it only took me about two hours. It's like a giant puzzle, and the ending was really sneaky. I think I missed the point though, so I'm going to have to read it again.   My Father's Scar by Michael Cart  Cuteness!! *dies* Words do not express the adorableness. I loved the characters and I felt really sorry for Andy for all this crap that happened to him when he was a kid. It's an accurate representation of the world, with bigots all over the place but the occasional hero. It's sweet and funny and sad and so very very cute! (Meg will be with me on this one. If you boy types do not appreciate romance, then it's your loss.)   The Drowning of Stephan Jones by Bette Greene  I'm traumatized. I truly am. But this is the sort of thing that happens all the time, and I think Ms. Greene was really brave to get this out in the open. However, it does not end well. (Those of you familiar with her work, ie: Summer of My German Soldier, will know how her books end. Depressingly.) Look for the shameless plug on page 73. I'm serious, though, this book was so depressing that I went outside on the ferry and just cried.  If any of you are wondering "What's with all the gay people?" which I hope you aren't, because gay people rock, but if you are it's because of this little trick I found on the card catalogue. You can, in fact, search by keyword. So if one were to search for "homosexuality: fiction", one would find about twenty books, almost all in the Young Adult section. They are by well-known authors, wonderful stories, and best of all:  they are never checked out.  Sad but true. Actually, not really sad, because this means I get to read them. Yay!

      I even made a pretty bracelet out of masking tape to celebrate.  But then I threw it away.  Tomorrow I am going rock climbing.  I have a picture of daisies which are my favorite flowers.  I also have Chronic Laughter Disease, where I can't shut up laughing.  I was laughing all through our smoking is bad so you need to breathe throught a straw excercise.  We went in the darkroom which has a nifty spinny door but it gets very very dark inside.  Caleb is the talk of the camp and limos are cool.  Also the driver's ed book is boring, and computers hate me.

      Dean [Thomas] is from what he has always thought of as a purely Muggle background.  He has been happily raised by his mother and stepfather; his father walked out on the family when he was very young... when the letter came from Hogwarts Dean's mother wondered if his father might have been a wizard, but nobody has ever discovered the truth: that Dean's father, who had never told his wife what he was because he wanted to protect her, got himself killed by Death Eaters when he refused to join them.  Summary: Dean is a half blood, and therefore eligible to possibly be The Prince.

      What am I supposed to DO?!?!?!?  I was at the library again this morning and totally forgot to ask Judith about it, I was too busy looking up synonyms for hate/despise/detest/loathe/abhor  They have the OED and it's like this big and the writing is this small and it's very cool, except some of the words in the definition I have to go and look up them too, which gets annoying. Oh, U, I read Faerie Wars, I quite liked it.  D'you know what the sequel's called, or if there's one out yet, or whatever?  Have you read Tithe?  I forget who wrote it...but it's about faeries, too, and I think it's pretty good.  Um.  I read Lirael, and got out Abhorsen, which I shall read once I've finished with Abarat, which you should all read when I turn it back in, cuz it's good too.  What I've read of it is.  And there was that other book, and...um.  Or maybe there wasn't.  Never mind.  And I need to read Something Wicked This Way Comes this month. Ooh, I found our Harry Potters.  The first three my second oldest brother got for his birhtday years ago, and he's gotten all protective of all of them ever since I took them to Alabama a few months ago, which I think makes no sense as they have been my car-trip reading for years.  But he hid them, and  my  copy of So You Want To Be A Wizard, but I got James to get SYWTBAW for me, so I could lend it to him, and it was with the Harry Potters, so I found them.  Wha-ha-ha!

      Anie and I were at the library, and we saw Abe, and I got the book, and I read it, and I liked it, and I got Clockwork, and I read it, and I liked it, and I got I Am The Cheese again, and I have to read it again, but I still don't like it, and I got another one that I haven't read but it reminds me of Tangerine, which I always thought was about aliens until I read it, and I didn't like Tangerine very much, except I did.  I love your shirt, Abe.

      It was so good, and I love that shirt.  It's in the wash right now.  I want to use the leaves to make window hangings because they fit perfectly but I don't know if mum'll let me.  Anyway.
