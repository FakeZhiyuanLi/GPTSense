       Well, well, took me awhile but I'm always forgetting something that I wanted to do. I'll probably bore ya all stiff every time but hey, it's coming out of my head so it's my boredom to. Well just found out a couple days ago that a friend is back in he!!. I won't go into details or names but this poor guy can't get a break. His women crap on him, the law hates him (for what I have no idea. it's not like he's a real crimanal or anything it's just that these cops are buttheads.), and he just can't seem to have much luck. That just bites the big one. I know how it goes though. If it were'nt for bad luck then we would'nt have any luck. First the van went back in the shop but luckily it didnt cost as much this time:). Then we went to the drivein and some bratty kid was in the car next to us so we moved. I know, does'nt seem that bad but if you knew me then it is. I don't like crowds or alot of people, that's why I mostly stay home to avoid people or crowds. Thank goodness my hubby's the same way. Though I do get cabin fever now and then and have to get out but not often. Well not really much else going on in this dead end town. We have a family reunion to go to in the morning after church and it will be ok as long as my sister in law doesnt show up. She could make the sunshine run away. She's a real witch and tht's putting it mildly. I need to get some letters written before bed so I'd better say bye' for now. Ya all take care and stay sweet. Kudo's out to my buds, Elfsong &amp; Gabby even though Gabs is indisposed at the moment. I'm here for ya guys.

      Just thought id give this a try. I'm not good at putting my thoughts or whatever on paper and then letting other folks read them but hey I figured what the heck I'll give it the once around. Any how, I'd like to just say that its nice knowing everybody and I would like to tell you about my sweet hubby Jason. We met when I worked at shell 4 years ago and have been together ever since. Not even his family has been able to seperate us and they have tried one way or another but they would swear that they didn't try. (ha-ha) I've been in foster homes all my life until I was 16 so I can spot liars and creeps a mile away and believe me I don't trust any one but Jason nor do I like very many people because I have found that most people don't mean what they say and are just waiting for a chance to stab you in the back. I cant stand people who say they will do something and then don't or say they will help you and then don't. I also don't like to be used. Boy does that tick me off. I hate helping someone do something but then when I need help or something they all of a sudden have something else to do or they got go somewhere. So you know what I say? Well I cant say what I want to cause it'd aint really nice but I can tone it down some and say bump them!! Any time I do something for someone any more and its going to cost them. I aint nobody's maid or slave. I am Native American and I have a very hard head, I'm stubborn and will argue with you in a heartbeat if I know I'm right or p***** off. When I'm mad or upset its best to just back off and leave me the f*** alone. Sorry for the stars but I'm trying to be censured and keep it somewhat nice but also get my point across. I don't believe in lying to someone. If I think they are rude, or something I will tell them but I don't go out of my way to be mean to someone either, I'm just honest. Well I think that's enough for now ill catch you all on the flip.  shouts go out to my buds Robert and mike. Hey rob this could be good therapy for me when I need to vent. Thanks dude. Later and smile God loves yah:)
