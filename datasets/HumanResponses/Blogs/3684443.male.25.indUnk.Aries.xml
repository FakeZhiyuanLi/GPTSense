       Navigating   I woke up early, of course.  The morning hours went by very quickly, what with the sorrowful farewell to my family, the loading of my van, and the initial shock of knowing that I was actually doing it.  I was driving to California, and I had no clue what would happen next.  It was exhilarating to say the very least.	  Navigation during the trip was a breeze, thanks to my family's assistance.  My parents were, in their typical fashion, incredibly helpful.  They had stopped by a AAA service center and got me something called a TripTik - an easy-to-follow, customizable, multi-paged map of the entire trans-American road trip ahead of me. TripTiks rock, and I suggest anyone going on a road trip to get one.    I was advised to take I-40, which is one of the two ‘middle routes’ one can take to get across the US.  My mom didn’t want me to drive along the possibly snowy mountain roads of Montana and Colorado.  And I didn’t want to risk venturing into the deep, deep south, where all around me there'd be nothing but forest, banjo music and homo-erotic danger, just like in that movie Deliverance.    So we all decided it was best that I take I-40 for my first cross-country experience.  I had a feeling that I wouldn’t regret this choice.  Before I could get to I-40 West and turn on the mental cruise control, I had to first drive south a ways and get there.  This involved a few highway switches, some potentially confusing navigation in the Baltimore area, and a kinda out-of-the-way, northward detour in Maryland that would keep me away from the Washington D.C. area, which I'm told can be a traffic nightmare at times.  I thought the first day would be tricky, but it wasn't bad.  Sure, it was tricker than the rest of the trip; but anything is tricky when compared to "get on 40 West and keep going straight for about a week."      Getting lost in Frederick   It was about noon when I decided to stop for the very first time.  My first reprieve from driving took place in Frederick, MD.  I pulled up in front of a Burger King, gave my mom the first of what would be numerous phone calls along the way, then popped open the little cooler she had given me.  I then ate my travel snack of the day - Chocolate Junior cakes.    Chocolate Junior cakes are scrumtralescent.  In my reality, they’re among the greatest things ever.  I do my best not to eat them too often, lest I commit the sacrilege of growing tired of them after repeated exposure.  So I only eat them when I get a really big jonsin’ for them; or during special occasions.  I thought that making my very first pit stop on my very first cross-country road trip was indeed a special occasion, so I ripped open the cake’s wrapper and feasted upon the nummy milk chocolate atop the fluffy sponge cake.  Perhaps it was the excitement of this endeavor, or perhaps it was because sitting on your ass for four straight hours isn’t a fuel-intensive workout, but the Chocolate Junior, the remainder of a McDonald’s sausage biscuit and the orange soda that went along with them were more than enough to sustain me for the remainder of the day.  So I climbed back into the Righteous Indignation and headed off.  Or at least I would have headed off if I hadn’t gotten lost in freakin’ Frederick, MD. Due to construction along the exit leading back to highway 81, I got sidetracked for about half an hour.  At first I was kinda miffed, but after a few minutes I found that I didn’t mind the diversion at all.  It gave me a few minutes to drive around Maryland and take note of a few things.  First off, I don’t know if it was just interesting timing or the reality of the town, but I spotted some very attractive women in Frederick.   In the parking lot of Burger King, I spotted this hot, bespeckled blonde driving something sporty.  There was a pretty Hispanic-looking lady walking away from the restaurant just as I was pulling in.  And, much to my surprise, I spotted a female construction worker while I was caught in the traffic of the work zone.  I was surprised not only because I had never before seen a female construction worker, but because she also happened to be beautiful in a butch, I-can-kick-your-ass kinda way.  Driving past this femme construction worker reminded me of the time in high school when I nearly fell in love with a lesbian.  But that’s a story for a different time, perhaps a different journal entry.  After a wrong turn taken while trying to avoid the work zone entirely, I wound up driving through residential Frederick some.  It had a nice, quaint and folksy atmosphere to it, one that appealed to me significantly.  In those few short minutes driving around the area, I thought about someday living in Maryland, perhaps right there in Frederick.  But first things first - I had to get to LA first and see what would become of that.  Eventually I freed myself of Frederick, MD, and my southward trek continued.     The two Virginias   Within an hour, I was in Virginia, and in the heart of hick country.  Actually, before I had even crossed the border into Virginia, I was driving over muddy rivers, flipping through multiple country stations on the radio, and passing by a fleet of pick-up trucks on the road.  I marveled at how quickly and easily one can get from the suburbs of Cherry Hill, NJ to border of Redneck, USA.  Not that it’s a bad thing.  I recently got into country music; after studying the values of southerners / westerners through this music, I came to realize that they’re good folk.  Of course they’re good folk, because the songs they write include references to lasting love, raising families, going to church on Sundays, and being both aware and appreciative of the blessings in your life.    Granted, I still don’t want to venture way, way south, where I hear things can get so redneck it’s surreal.  But at least I now realize that being in a community of hicks can be quite a good thing.  Who knows, maybe someday I’ll find myself living in Tennessee or Texas or something.  Anyways, I passed through Virginia without incident.  I got to listen to a lot of country music I hadn’t listened to in Jersey - some old-school country music from the likes of Conway Twitty, Hank Williams the 1st, and some of Dolly Pardon’s earlier stuff.  Damn good music, and very appropriate for my surroundings.  While flipping through the available radio stations, I came upon another random thought that tickled me greatly.  I stumbled upon one of the Virginia’s only eighties stations, and almost immediately ‘Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now’ filled the interior of my minivan.  There I was, driving through Virginia in the Righteous Indignation, listening to an awesomely bad eighties song and singing along to it at the top of my lungs.  From that point on during the drive, I took note of the songs that were nothing but appropriate for a road trip (mostly country songs), and the songs that really didn’t fit the situation at all (mostly eighties songs and the occasional tune by Michael Bolton).  Needless to say my radio was on almost the entire time I was on the road.  When I got to West Virginia, something odd struck me.  Actually, it struck my windshield.  The biggest bug I had ever seen outside of the Philippines got splattered on my windshield.  That in itself wasn’t that odd; the strange part was that during the next couple of hours the bugs just kept on coming.  One after another, these bugs kept getting plastered onto my windshield.  Pretty soon I realized that the air above the highway was filled with flying roadkill.  Of course it wasn’t so thick with them that I was immediately reminded of the plague o' locusts scene from ‘Ten Commandments’ or nuthin’.  But the bug cover was noticeable.  Maybe it’s just me, but I found the idea ridiculous and funny.  I don’t think I hit a single bug during the first 6 hours of my road trip.  Then all of a sudden it was an insect massacre painted right in front of me.  I began to wonder if the bug population of West Virginia was significantly dumber than that of any other state.  Or perhaps the insectoid suicide rate of the state was just higher.   I sought refuge behind a Winnebego for the remainder of the drive through West Virginia.   Stopping for the Night   By around 6 or 7 that night, I was getting sleepy.  Paranoia struck me then, I decided that I had best pull over for the night before I get into an accident.    I still had at least one or two hours left of daylight.  I had only driven for about 10 hours, and I had only covered 422 miles.  It was for these reasons that I dubbed this first day my ‘Pussy Driver Day.’  I would later make up for the pussy-ness of that first day later that week.  And despite this pussy-ness, I still had a very fun day of driving.  So it came to be that my very first ‘stop for the night’ on my very first cross-country road trip was Marion, Virginia.  (That’s right, the route I had taken took me from Virginia to West Virginia, then back into Virginia.  Don’t ask me to explain.)  For fifty bucks, I got a cozy little room in an Econolodge.  I ate the remainder of my Chocolate Junior supply, showered, and bunked down for the night.  But not before taking advantage of the cable t.v. and watching ‘Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.’  I slept well that night, but not before dreaming of these horrible, little orange-skinned men who sang this hauntingly catchy song of judgement.     Now for some vital statistics of the day:  # of bugs splattered: 139 # of huge and really squishy bugs I had to pry off of my windshield wipers and grill: 10  # of pick-ups seen before Maryland: 2 # of pick-ups seen after Maryland: 51  Most appropriate road trip song of the day: ‘If You Ever Stopped Loving Me’ by Montgomery Gentry.   Don’t let the name fool you; this is a real ball-kicking song that goes well with a road trip.  Least appropriate road trip song of the day: ‘Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.’ “And if this world runs out of lovers We’ll still have each other Nothing’s gonna stop us (nothing’s gonna stop us) nooooow"  Funniest sight of the day: After passing the Susquehanna River in Maryland, I spotted a water tower that looked like a gigantic, upright sperm.  I don’t know what’s in that area’s water supply, but I sure as hell wasn’t going to drink it.  Travel ration of the day: Chocolate Juniors.  They are yummy.

      Before I get into the first day of my 5-day trek across the United States, let me begin by explaining what the Righteous Indignation is.  I drive a 2000 Dodge Caravan, an automobile which I’m told no self-respecting 25 year-old bachelor should be driving.  But I don’t care.  My royal blue minivan is pretty damn reliable; it gets excellent mileage; it has tons of space, especially after I tossed out the unnecessary back passenger seat; plus I have to admit that I’m tickled by the idea of cruisin’ around in a minivan and getting into fun and silly adventures.    Before I set off on my cross-country drive, I thought I may as well give my van a name.  I thought about giving it a feminine name, since us guys seem to have a tendency of giving inanimate objects we’re fond of girlie names.  But that idea was quickly swept away when I was, for reasons I cannot explain, reminded of a short-lived kids cartoon called ‘Bucky O’Hare and the Toad Wars.’  Bucky O’Hare was a bizarre cartoon.  It was about this green-furred, anthropomorphic, laser-wielding, Han Solo-like space bunny that, with the help of his rag-tag group of star-cruising freedom fighters, does battle with a toad empire that seeks to enslave every planet in a universe populated by militaristic bunnies, monkey scientists, four-armed ducks, and one, solitary human.  I’m not making this shit up.  Anyways, Buckminster O’Hare was the captain of a highly-advanced gunship which was dubbed the Righteous Indignation.  When I remembered the name of the ship, I immediately knew what the new name of my van would be.  Not only did naming my van after a gunship in a wacky and surprisingly well-written cartoon series appeal to me, but I’m also amused by how inappropriate the name is.  There’s absolutely nothing indignant about a Dodge Caravan.  There probably isn’t any car in the market today that’s quite as non-threatening and laid-back; it’s the kinda car that loves everybody and is loved in return.  So there you have it.  I tool around the United States in the Righteous Indignation.  Motorists and pedestrians beware.

      More likely than not, if you’re reading this blog (heh, blog), then you already know who I am.  But just in case you don’t, here’s some background info.  My name is Richard J Reyes.  I’m known affectionately by family and friends as RJ, and it is by these familiar initials that I will refer to myself in these blogs.    I lived in the east coast most of my life.  Grade school, high school, college, my first jobs - all of these important periods and events in my life have taken place in either New Jersey or Pennsylvania, all within close proximity to my funtastic family.    I thought of my life as being pleasantly uneventful.  Many of my days off would be a blur of video game playing, movie or cable t.v. watching, book reading, and overall lounging.  It was a good life; and the uneventful pleasant-ness was something with which I was most content.  Then all of a sudden, maybe a couple of months ago, I was struck with an entirely unexpected wanderlust.  I work for an international airline, which I used to think was ironic considering I haven’t left the continent in over 10 years.  But through my job, I was presented with the opportunity to transfer from Philadelphia’s international airport to the one in Los Angeles.    A year ago, I wouldn’t have even considered such a thing.  I would have thought that being that far away from my family and everything else I had grown to love about my home would have been unbearable.  Besides that,  moving is one huge pain in the ass; moving from one freakin’ coast to the other would have been horrifically obnoxious.  Plus I never liked cities.  The depressing appearance of residential Philadelphia and the relentless hustle-bustle atmosphere of New York had made me quite anti-urban.    But that was then.  Now, much to my surprise (and sometimes to my bewilderment), I find myself in Los Angeles.  Three thousand miles away from my beloved family, my chums, my home and surroundings I had grown so accustomed to.  I drove here.  And perhaps wackiest of all, I have an apartment right in the heart of LA.    Actually, I take that back.  What’s wackiest of all is the fact that I’m having a ball.  The next several blogs - the blogs for the Summer months and perhaps a few months after - will deal primarily with my (mostly true) California experiences.  I’ll start off by back-tracking; the first few blogs will be about my cross-country drive here, and all the funny things I observed along the way.  After that it’ll probably take a few more blogs to cover what I’ve seen, done, and thought about during my first three weeks in LA.  After that, who knows what I’ll write about.   Here and there I’m sure to toss in some totally random thoughts of mine.    After all is said and written, I hope to have amassed a collection of journal entries that are mildly amusing at worst, and ball-grabbingly entertaining at best.  Hope you enjoy, and keep on reading, whoever you are.

       I woke up in a motel in Arkansas.  That in itself was pretty ludicrous.  Little did I know that the day would end even weirder, what with me driving past Texas in the dead of night, having hallucinations of black trees and my wang bathed in an eerie red light.      But I’ll get to those details later.  First thing’s first.       What a Great Day     I was the last person to leave that Days Inn in Brinkley, Arkansas.  I could tell, ‘cause the parking lot that was full the night before had only me and the Righteous Indignation by the time I left.  That must’ve made me real popular with the cleaning staff, who I imagine just wanted to get their job done as quickly and as early as possible.      I fueled up and had yet another breakfast of beef jerky.  I began the day not feeling too hungry, and I told myself that I wouldn’t have a real meal until I reached Oklahoma.  It considered it a little incentive to make it to America’s pan-shaped state as quickly as possible; I still felt that I had to make up a whole lot of miles in order to get to LA before my Sunday appointment.    So with nothing in my stomach but beef jerky and orange juice, I hit the road.  It was early in the morning and the sun was shining bright.  I had hundreds of miles to cover before I would rest.  I had the rest of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and maybe even Texas to see that day.  And my van was full of gas.      Travis Tritt’s ‘It’s a Great Day to Be Alive’ came on the radio.  As I was singing along I couldn’t help but agree with Mr. Tritt one hundred percent.    Not long after that, I had the pleasure of stumbling upon the Radio Disney channel.  So there I was, gunning through Arkansas in the Righteous Indignation while trying desperately to sing along to ‘Chitti-Chitti-Bang-Bang.’  Yes, it was a great day, indeed.                                           Hungry in Arkansas     Soon my stomach was transmitting the imaginary sights and smells of catfish and southern fried chicken to my all too receptive mind.  As good as beef jerky is, it doesn’t sustain you as well as a full-fledged breakfast can, and my tummy was reminding me of this fact.  But I held strong and told myself that I wouldn’t eat well again until I reached Oklahoma.  I figured that I’d make it there before lunchtime.    Then I hit traffic on I-40.    I-40 in Arkansas must’ve been receiving one hell of a face lift, ‘cause there were several places where construction slowed the flow of traffic to a halt.  I figured that without traffic, I would’ve cleared Arkansas and made it to Oklahoma well before lunchtime.  But as it turned out, noon rolled around and I was still in the state where I had started.    Instead of being annoyed, I was pleased, if not peckish and somewhat anxious.  This stop-and-go flow gave me the opportunity to have a thorough look around; to appreciate Arkansas in all of its wacky splendor.    I discovered that Arkansas has some of the coolest park names ever.  On the road, I passed by Aux Arc Park (a name which I kept repeating in my head for hours), and Toad Suck Park.  I really wanted to stop by Toad Suck Park, but I figured that I had been delayed enough as it was.  Toad Suck Park would have to wait another day.    I also drove past Arkansas Tech.  I don’t think I have to say anything more about that.     It was just past noon when I passed the very last of the big construction zones, and I was back to gunning it at break-neck speed (or as close to break-neck as you can get in a loaded-up Dodge Caravan).  By this point, I was pretty damn hungry.  So I decided to pay a visit to a rest area.    America’s rest areas rule, by the way.  Bathrooms, vending machines, and maps.  What more do you need when you’re on a road trip?  Sometimes the rest areas are combined with a visitors’ welcome center, where you’ll actually meet these fine folks who’re paid to tell you why their state kick ass, and give you brochures as proof of that.  Yes, America’s rest stops rule.  They are my daddy.    Anyways, I parked at an Arkansas rest stop, looking forward to the opportunity to answer Nature’s call and to get myself a bag of chips or a candy bar or somesuch from the vending machine.      Alas, fate would see to the perpetuation of my hunger.  Between me and the vending machine was a closed gate.  So the chocolate-y goodness and potato chips were off limits.      Kinda miffed off and grumbly in the tumbly, I climbed back into the RI and drove off, intent on finding another rest stop and another set of vending machines.  I succeeded at the rest stop park.  The vending machine part wasn’t so good, though, ‘cause there were no freakin’ vending machines available.      I guess fate wanted to hold me to the promise I made to myself - I would not eat until Oklahoma.       Oklahoma, Finally     The state snuck up on me.  I was hungry and kinda zoning out when I passed by the big roadside sign that proudly announced that I had crossed the Oklahoma border.  I remember my first thought vividly,  “Holy shit.  I’m in Oklahoma.”    It was thus time to feast.    I took the exit that lead me to an interstate town called Sawisil.  There, I had plenty of choices for food.  KFC.  A Sonic drive-thru.  Diners and restaurants.  I was salivating in Sawisil.  Next thing I know, I’m sitting in the van with a bag of hot wings and potato wedges in my lap and a chilled orange soda in my left hand.  Bliss.    It eventually occurred to me just how orange my meal was.  Orange hot wings.  Basically orange potato wedges, which would have struck me as odd if I hadn’t been so hungry.  And the soda.  The remnants of my oh so very orange meal were quite visible around my lips and my fingertips.    I must’ve looked quite comical.  Orange-faced, orange-fingered, hair all a mess after driving all morning with the window down, dressed in sweaty cargo shorts and an even sweatier tank top.  I decided to find a bathroom and freshen up returned to my drive.    I walked to the nearby Sonic.  I’d never before seen a Sonic, and my experience with drive-thrus is limited.  I walked right into the main structure, thinking that even though it was a drive-thru, they’d have bathrooms.  Like a gas station.  Nothing fancy, just something with a sink and cool, running water.    I step into the little building and discover that I’ve walked right into the kitchen.  Before I could turn around, my ears are buffeted by a woman’s scream.  I guess seeing an orange-faced stranger barge into the kitchen was too much for her.  I turned tail and ran out of there like a thief in the night.      I found the sink and the cool running water I so eagerly sought without further incident, no other screaming women.  A bit shaken, I returned to the road.       No Rest Till Texas     With both me and the Righteous Indignation fueled up, I felt ready to drive until dusk.  That’s exactly what I did.  With no more traffic in my way, I had the pedal to the floor and the wind in my hair for hours after the incident in Sonic.    Oklahoma had always been something of an alluring mystery to me, believe it or not.  All I knew about it was that it’s shaped like a pan and that there’s a musical about it; the only musical I can think of whose title ends with an exclamation point, so it must be exciting.    The drive through Oklahoma may have been uneventful, but it was quite pretty and kinda enlightening.  I can now say I’ve been in Oklahoma; and I have to make it a point to return there for a more thorough exploration.    I stopped only once more that day, so by sunset I was in Texas.  Texas in an awesome place to watch a sunset, I discovered, thanks to the flat landscape.  It was such a gorgeous dusk - in the diminishing light, I watched the sky turn orange (a reoccurring color of the day) to purple to dark blue then black.  The setting sun cast its dying light upon the clouds hovering just above its resting place, and the colorful results left me staring with my jaw hanging open.  I can’t quite describe what a lovely experience it was.  All I can say is that I’ll have to someday return to Texas just to see the sunset.    And to buy myself a 10 gallon hat and some chaps.    At around midnight, I stopped in Shamrock, Texas and had a late dinner at a hotel-side diner.  I had a burger, fries, and a pleasant conversation with one of the waitresses.  I also had a whole lotta coffee.  I’m not a coffee drinker, but I decided that if there was any time for me to load up on caffeine, it would be that night.  I had already driven about 600 miles, but I promised myself that I would not stop for good that night until I was in New Mexico.  I was on a mission, and I had enough caffeine in me to help me see that mission through.       Images of my Wang     I was jittery with all the coffee I had guzzled down when I hit the road again that night.      Which leads me to another tangent - night driving.  Driving in the dead of night when there’s no one sharing the road or the highway with you is freakin’ awesome.  I’ll have to dedicate another blog entry to how awesome it is.    Anyways, I drove for a few hours more.  I passed by Amarillo, which the waitress back in Shamrock told me is a very pretty city.  Sorry, Amarillo, I was on a mission to New Mexico, so I’ll have to stop by another time.    By around 3 in the morning, my caffeine high was wearing off.  I began to doze off, and doze off bad.  I fought against the need for sleep and succeeded, but that didn’t keep me from the hallucinations.    I began to see these ethereal, purply shadow trees on the sides of the road.  I began to imagine Mac trucks stopped in the middle of the highway; stopped in the dark just past large circles of yellowish-white cast by my headlights.      Perhaps weirdest of all, images of my wang began to haunt my sleep-deprived mind.  Why, I wondered.  Why was this image of my privates flashing before my mind’s eye?  And why was my junk bathed in this pulsating, blood-red light?    When I finally regained a better portion of my senses, I came to the realization that I wasn’t hallucinating.  What I was seeing really was my wang in a pulsating, blood-red light...I was standing behind the Righteous Indignation, the emergency stop lights were flashing, and I was relieving myself on New Mexican soil.    Miraculously, I had made it to New Mexico in my dazed state without incident.  And apparently I had decided to mark my territory just before the second or third exit leading into Tucumcari.      That’s where I spent the night - in a Best Western in Tucumcari.  I can’t tell you how welcome that large, stiff-as-a-board bed was to me that night, nor how thankful, and amazed, I was that I had made it this far without getting into an accident.      It wasn’t the smartest thing I had ever done - driving through Texas in the condition I was in.  But man, was it fun.        Best Road Trip Song of the Day:   Travis Tritt, ‘It’s a Great Day to Be Alive.’  Oh, and ‘Chitti-Chitti-Bang-Bang.’  Oh hell yeah.    Least appropriate Road Trip Song of the Day: Gretchen Wilson’s ‘Redneck Woman.’  Don’t get me wrong, this is one butt-kicking song.  What was inappropriate about it was that I, a Filipino dude from the suburbs of Jersey, was singing about how cool it is to be a sexy, proud redneck woman.  I couldn’t help it, it’s a fun song.    Food of the Day - Oklahoma hot wings.      Miles Driven - A little over 750.      Places I want to visit another time:    Toad Suck Park  Arkansas Tech  Amarillo  The spot just outside Tucumcari that I marked as my territory.

         I’ve been in Los Angeles for less than two months now, and already I’m in love with this city.    Those who really know me know that I’m not a big fan of cities.  Or at least that was the case before.  I was born in Philadelphia, but I never lived there while I could remember and thus never developed any heart-felt bond with the area.      New York is awesome, and I have fond memories of taking bus trips with my mom there to watch Broadway shows and eat overpriced deli sammiches.  But I really dislike the rush-rush-rush atmosphere of NY.  And it smells like pee.    I still may not be a big fan of cities in general.  But I do really enjoy being in Los Angeles.  This city tickles me, and I’m sure you’re eager to find out why.    First off, in this city there exists an amalgamation of races, cultures, and peoples that you’ll be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  Filipino, Armenian, Japanese, Thai, Mexican, El Salvadorian, Indian, Korean, Peruvian, Arabic, Chinese.  You name it, and not only will you be able to find these people, but you’ll find the large communities that they have formed somewhere in the heart of LA.  Little Tokyo, for instance, is the biggest Japanese community outside of Japan.     Recently, a cousin of mine spent a few days here.  When she told me later about it, she summed it up beautifully by saying, “It doesn’t look like America.”  That was my initial reaction to the place as well.  But after some thought, I decided that, in a funny way, Los Angeles looks exactly like America.      What amuses me further is the fact that each culture is not only represented by the people themselves; each one is also represented by strip malls.  Every single race has at least one strip mall comprised entirely of stores geared directly to them.  There’s not one but two Filipino strip malls within walking distance of my apartment, which means that I’m never lacking in Filipino cuisine.  On my way to work I pass by several of the Korean and I believe Thai variety.  And of course there are plenty of Latino strip malls everywhere else.    I’m also quite taken with the sound of Los Angeles.  The languages of all the different peoples living in LA come together rather beautifully at times.  One moment you can be enfolded by dozens of voices speaking in Spanish, and then the next you can be bombarded by Chinese, which has an amusingly abrasive quality to it when it’s spoken loud and fast enough.  Having a Chinese person yelling at you can be quite an unforgettable experience.    Oh, and the food.  I surely can’t forget the food.  As mentioned earlier, I’m not lacking in Filipino food, and I eat that every other day or so; perhaps more than I did when I as living at home, which is kinda funny.  I eat sushi whenever I’m in the mood for cold rice wads (heh, wad of rice) and cold shrimp (mmm...cold shrimp).  For the past two days I’ve had Mexican for lunch.  There’s a Peruvian restaurant a few blocks away that I want to try.  And lately I’ve been eating a lot of Thai food; I’m going to write about my first experience with Thai food shortly after posting this entry.    And if I want a good ole American meal, there’s plenty to choose from there as well.  LA is an excellent place to get juicy, greasy, you-need-two-hands-to-eat-‘em burgers.  Which reminds me...one of these days I’ll have to write about my burger experience thus far.      But anyways, the food around here is fantastic.       I love the fact that in my neighborhood there are children everywhere, ‘cause it’s very difficult to be in a bad mood when you’re surrounded by laughing, playing, chubby-faced kids.  Kids and palm trees and sun - a triple hit of happy goodness that is guaranteed to chase away all but the deepest of blues.  They’re all right outside.    I love my location within LA.  I’m just west of downtown LA and south of Hollywood.  The ‘south of Hollywood’ part is the more important bit for me right now, ‘cause I’ve been spending a lot of time in the Hollywood area watching movies and sightseeing and such.  I can’t begin to describe how funny it is to be a Jersey boy who’s suddenly only a ten minute drive away from Hollywood.    Hell, I’m just a few minutes away from so many things.  Just west of here is the Farmer’s Market, which is an awesome place to eat.  Further than that is the beach and the Pacific Coast Highway, an opportunity for some truly kick-ass driving and sightseeing that I have yet to truly take advantage of.  North of here are the Hollywood Hills, which I can actually see from my apartment.  My apartment view gives me a splendiferous view of the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood Sign - yes, I can see the freakin’ Hollywood Sign just by going out on my patio.  Beyond that is The Valley.  Beyond that is...well, the rest of California and all that it has to offer.      Christ, I’ve been here for nearly two months, and I’ve been keeping quite active I think, and still I’ve barely scratched the surface of the things to do and see here.  I have a lot of work to do and a lot more fun to have.    Whelp, there is a whole lot more I’d like to write about Los Angeles, but I’d better not cram it all in to a single entry.  I’ll write more as I experience more, and I hope you continue to read.

       Beef Jerky in the Morning   I woke up nice and early on Wednesday.  I’m tempted to say ‘bright and early,’ but I woke up before dawn to heavy rain, so the ‘bright’ part wouldn’t exactly be accurate.  I wanted to set off right away, because I wanted to make up for the almost laughable 400 miles I had covered on my first day.  If I continued at that rate, it would have taken me more than a week to get to California; and I only had until Sunday.  I figured that if I drove almost 700 miles every day after that, that would more than compensate for my ‘day of driving like a pussy,’ and I’d be able to make it to LA by Saturday night.   It was raining hard when I woke up, so instead of heading off right away I watched cable t.v. for a little while.  Cable t.v. sucks ass at 6 in the morning no matter what state you’re in, so I was glad that the weather settled down an hour later.  After checking out of the EconoLodge, I stopped by a gas station down the block for provisions and breakfast.  That’s when I discovered the food item that would be my sustenance for much of the remainder of my road trip - beef jerky.  Chocolate junior cakes rock my world, but the best food for road trips has got to be beef jerky.  If’s cheap, surprisingly filling, easy to eat while driving (a big plus), and best of all good beef jerky is pretty damn nummy.  To go along with the first of what would be many beef jerky meals along the way, I purchased a bottle of water.  Maybe it was just my good mood, but I found even the bottled water to be amusing.  It wasn’t a name brand that any of us would recognize; it was John Boy and Billy’s Brand Mountain Spring Water.    The picture was hysterical - two guys, one a bespeckled bald guy with a goofy smirk on his mug, and the other a beared, baseball cap-wearing hick type flashing one of the funniest shit-eating grins (in other words, a big grin) I can recall seeing.  I still have the bottle in my van.  Apparently, John Boy and Billy are radio personalities of a local Virginia station.  I would later find out that this was a popular combination as far as Southern radio duos were concerned - there’s the straight man, who in this case was Billy, and then you’d have a dude playing the part of the cliche redneck, John Boy.  Funny schtuff, as far as I’m concerned.   I-40 At Last   Anyhoos, after filling up on beef jerky and water and having a nice laugh over the picture on the bottle, I set off.  By noon I had left Virginia and started on my way through Tennessee.  Best of all, I had reached I-40, the highway that would carry me the rest of the way to California.  I now understand what’s meant when I hear the term ‘the hills of Tennessee,’ ‘cause that place is all fookin’ hills.  Driving along I-40, you drive through, over and around hills covered in trees, all as far as the eye can see.  At one point, I was driving with a seemingly endless expanse of Tennessee hills in front of, behind and to the left of me, and a muddy brown Tennessee river to my right.  Tennessee rocks.   What Did I Expect to Hear in Tennessee?   The music was fantastic as well.  Since I was deep into country music territory, or ‘Country country,’ if it pleases you, it was no surprise that every other station I switched my radio to was playing country tunes.  Hell, before dinnertime I was driving past Nashville, and you don’t get much more Country than Nashville.    So I was driving through, past, over, and around the hills of Tennessee while listening to the likes of Willie Nelson, Kenny Rogers, Merle Haggard, Garth Brooks, Alison Kraus and Patty Loveless.  This was all fine and dandy for me, since I couldn’t have been in any more of a mood to listening to this music as I was then.  But even if it wasn’t fine with me, I wouldn’t have much of a choice - in Tennessee, your radio choices are either Country or Christian music.  And as well all know, Christian music bites wrinkly ass.    Let me fix that statement a bit.  From what I could tell, old school Christian music is actually pretty good, if you’re into that kinda thing.  And there are many gospel songs that can get right down to the core of you and rock your world.  What I’m talking about is the newer stuff.  New Christian music is what really bites wrinkly ass.    I don’t claim to understand God.  Not at all.  But I got a feeling that reality’s architect has better things to do than listen to this crap.  So it was Country music that kept me company while I drove through Tennessee, the ‘Volunteer State.’    Volunteer State?     Is it just me, or is that state nickname kinda funny?  Even compared to some of the other goofy nicknames other states have:  Oregon - The Beaver State.  Yes, folks, they got beaver. Oklahoma - The Sooner State.  I learned what a ‘Sooner’ is, but it only made me think this nickname is even goofier than before. New Jersey - The Garden State.  I think Jersey should be called the Commuter State.  The state flag shouldn’t be a shield flanked by the goddesses of Agriculture and Liberty; it should show the back of a car passing through an EZ Pass booth on its way to New York or Philadelphia. Missouri - The Show Me State.  Missouri’s filled with voyeurs, apparently.   It's Bigger Than I Thought!   Anyhows, driving through Tennessee took me most of the day and much of the night.  I drove past Knoxville by lunchtime.  I got lost in the Nashville in the early afternoon.  That night, I passed by Memphis.    Before driving past Memphis, however, I made a stop in Jackson for food and fuel.  I ate at a place called Backyard Burger, which I’ll probably write more about in another entry.  Plus I went inside a Walmart Supercenter for the very first time.  Have you ever wondered what you would get if you mixed together Sears, Home Depot, Rite Aid and Acme with a little bit of gas station tossed in for flavor?  No?  I never have either.  But I guess somebody did, ‘cause we now have Walmart Supercenters.  These are wacky things, but they’re actually pretty damn convenient for people as lazy as me ‘cause you can get just about anything you need in one stop.  Reasonably priced clothes?  They got it.  Toothpaste?  Aisle 60.  Toilet paper and eggs?  You betcha.  Gas?  You can fill up right after you get your toilet paper and eggs.  They got it all.  Since they got it all, it’s no surprise how freakin’ huge these Supercenters are.  I’m not ashamed to admit that I got lost while wandering the aisles on more than one occasion.  But in the end, I figured out how to navigate this monstrosity of a store and buy what I thought I really needed.  These items included: a stainless steel pocket knife - hey, only a fool would go fight the giant scorpions of New Mexico unarmed; a first aid kit - when you’re fighting giant scorpions, you’re going to get hurt; water - fighting giant scorpions is thirsty work; and floss - simply because it’s a must have, with or without the giant scorpions.  With the Righteous Indignation stocked-up with provisions, I hit the road again and left Jackson, Tennessee at around 7 pm.  Three hours later, I was speeding past Memphis, and soon thereafter I crossed the Mississippi River.   Crap, it's Arkansas   That was awesome.  Not only had it been several years since I had seen Memphis, but I had never driven over the Mississippi River before.  The shame of it was that I didn’t make the time to actually drive into the city and go exploring, and that I was crossing the river at night when I couldn’t really see anything.  I promised myself I would make this trip again in the future, when I didn’t have a 5 day time limit hanging over my head.  So I drove over a legendary river.  That rocked.  On the bad side?  I was driving over the Mississippi in order to get to Arkansas.    Like most anyone else from the northeast, I had my preconceptions about Arkansas, and none of them were good.  At the time of the driving, I would have preferred to get through the state as quickly as possible and without any stops what-so-ever, lest I run into Bill Clinton or his kin and get molested.  Something silly like that.  I tried my damndest to drive while half-asleep.  But eventually I had to succumb to fatigue and common sense and check into a Days Inn in Brinkley, Arkansas.  The people I interacted with in that little interstate town proved to be friendly enough.  The readings from my hick-o-meter weren’t going off the scale.  So I relaxed, put my misconceptions aside, and had myself a nice sleep.  Arkansas' cool.    Notes of the Day:   Miles Driven: 650.  Better, but not quite there yet.  Best Road Trip Song: ‘Wide Open Spaces,’ by the Dixie Chicks.  Actually, it’s a tie between this song and ‘In the Jungle,’ by the Tokens.  You know, the ‘aweema way, aweema way’ song.  Not very appropriate, sure, but it's a great song to hear while driving.    Worst Road Trip Song: Two worst songs of the day, and I heard them back to back.  ‘You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling,’ by the Righteous Brothers immediately followed by ‘How can we be Lovers (when we can’t be Friends),’ by Michael Bolton.  Nothing kills the buzz of a road trip better than Michael Bolton.  Except, maybe, Celine Dion.  Minorities, other than me, seen all day: 2.  In the Walmart Supercenter, I saw two Indian ladies.  I played around with the idea that these two Indian ladies and me were the only miniorities in the entire state of Tennessee.  Which reminds me:  I'll have to someday write about 'RJ's Asian Nightmare.'    Pick-ups seen: Too many to count.  Burger Joint Franchise to look out for:  Backyard Burger.  Angus beef burgers in a fast food joint?  Be still my heart.  Road Trip Ration of the Day: Beef Jerky.  Don’t drive without it.

       Thai food.     I had heard about it many times before, but I hadn’t experienced it. That all changed when I moved. I now live in a neighborhood where the foods of so many different cultures are ridiculously easy for me to get my grubby little hands on - and subsequently sink my teeth into.     Anyhows, before I digress any further, back to the Thai food.    I had just dropped off my dry cleaning one day when I decided to step into a Thai restaurant and take advantage of the lunch special. We’re all familiar with Asian lunch specials - two entrees plus either noodles or rice, all for 5 bucks or less. So not only was I given the opportunity to try a new type of cuisine, but I could also be cheap about it. The deal couldn’t have been any sweeter.    So with a styrofoam container filled with Thai goodness, I skipped all the way back up to my apartment. Once there, I set my price down upon my kitchen counter, opened it up, and allowed my eyes and nose to feast upon the meal before my taste buds could do the same.    What awaited me was the following - beef and peppers and broccoli, a nice heapin’ helping of shrimp-friend-rice, and little chunks of BBQ chicken impaled upon mighty toothpicks. Me oh my, it looked appetizing. And I smelled delicious, too.     I don’t know if this is the standard of all Thai places, but along with the meal came this little tiny plastic container filled with a red liquid. It’s red like blood, and floating in it are tiny chunks of things I dare not attempt to identify. I took a whiff of the stuff, and the scent of it was like a pleasantly spicy punch to the face. It nearly got my eyes watering, it was so strong.     Knowing that I had to take it easy with this red liquid of delicious doom, I dumped all of it onto the shrimp fried rice and watched gleefully as the once white, then orange, now red grains of rice inflated after soaking in the sauce.     I got a Brisk iced tea from the fridge, then thought better of it and got another as back up. It was at that point that I sat down and ate. What happened next was interesting.    The beef ‘n’ peppers combined with the incredibly hot red rice sent my tongue straight into the inferno. ‘Hot ‘n’ spicy’ do not give what I tasted justice. What I tasted was...Red. The color Red. I tasted the color Red and all that it embodies. The BBQ chicken was not-quite-sweet, mostly tangy. And of course the Brisk iced tea I had brought along as a chaser was loaded down with sugar.    Sugar, spice, and BBQ sauce. The soft spongy-ness of the rice, the tenderness of the beef and chicken, the mostly soggy, somewhat crunchiness of the peppers. This conglomeration of tastes and textures that shouldn’t have rightfully gotten along instead came together in a way I previously could not imagine.     As Ken Griffey Jr. said on ‘The Simpsons,’   “It’s like there’s a party in my mouth, and everyone’s invited.”    There was indeed a party in mouth.  And I’ve always been a lightweight when it comes to partying.    I awoke maybe an hour or two later. I was on the ground, my cheek wet against the tiles covered in my drool. My tongue felt tingly. As I hoisted myself back up to my feet, I tried to remember what it was that knocked me out so thoroughly. Then I saw the open styrofoam container on my counter with the remnants of the Thai. The open styrofoam container, like a large, white mouth wide open in a mirthful and mocking laugh, telling me that I am not man enough to partake of such a grand meal.    But I knew otherwise.  Thai food, this food of the gods, would be mine again.

      We all have something we eat when we're feeling down; something that the mere thought of, let alone the consumption of, puts a satisfied smile on our mugs.   When most people talk about comfort food, they're usually referring to something that their mothers' spend hours cooking up in the kitchen - something that only that goddess we refer to as 'Mom' can create just right.   Or if not a home-cooked meal from our childhood memories, it's something weird and easy that they can make up on the spot - peanut butter and tuna fish sandwiches, Chef Boyardi nukem noodles shaped like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a pint of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey smothered in hot fudge, that sorta schtuff.  Just this morning I realized that there isn't a specific food item that I consider to be my comfort food.  My comfort food is anything that comes in a sack.  I love sack food.  McDonald's nuggets and fries to go.  Thai or Chinese food, which for some reason always comes in a ridiculously over-sized brown paper bag.  A Chick-fil-et sandwich along with them waffle fries.  Or simply a carton of rice and some soup.  As long as these items are in sack form and I'm bringing them back to my apartment to eat, then I'm happy.  Go figure.

      Two Fridays ago, I called in sick from work so that I could go to Disneyland with my family.  Calling in sick to see Mickey and Goofy is delicious.  I recommend it to everybody.

      Before going to bed after the first day of my Jersey-to-California road trip, I watched 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."  I hadn’t realized it when I watched it as a kid, but this movie is truly fooked up in more ways than one.  And I'm not even talking about those Oompa Loompa bastards.  First off, Willy Wonka, at least as he was portrayed by Gene Wilder, was a dick.  A charismatic, likeable dick, but a dick none-the-less.  You know the type; the kinda guy who does some really asshole-y things, but can get away with it because he’s charming or funny.  Like when that gluttonous German boy fell into the river of chocolate, Wonka made wry jokes about it instead of doing anything to help.  And he would continue to make witty remarks while calamity befell the other children.  Sure, those kids deserved what they got.  And I suppose you could say that the bad kids in the movie - every kid that wasn’t that blonde-haired, buck-toothed douchebag, Charlie Bucket - and their equally rotten parents were representations of the seven deadly sins and the punishment that committing these sins would inevitably bring about.   But whether Willy Wonka’s actions were justified or not, he acted like a dick.    And what was up with the blonde douchebag’s family?  He had four grandparents who spent all day, every day, lying in the same bed, under the same blanket, spooning each other.  They didn't get out of bed, let alone their jammies.  It's doubtful that they made any attempt to bathe.  I bet that bed, if not all of that small house, stunk like crazy.  On a final note on that movie, I think it was hysterical that Charlie Bucket, after uncovering the last Golden Ticket, chose to take his smelly, bed-ridden granddad on the tour of the Chocolate Factory instead of his mom.  His mom washes clothes all day in order to keep Charlie DoucheBucket, her invalid parents, not to mention her invalid in-laws, housed and fed.  So what does she get for her troubles?  Instead of being sainted, she gets an ungrateful, metrosexual son and very awkward living conditions rife with elderly spooning and one very big, smelly bed.  It's amazing what passes as family entertainment sometimes.

       Before I get into this movie review, let me get one thing straight.    I have an irrational hatred towards Spiderman, whom I have gleefully dubbed ‘The Crimson Fairy.’ I acknowledge the fact that he’s a fun character with a distinct style and some really cool gimmicks: web crawling, web slinging and swinging, ultra-gay poses and posturing, squiggly lines drawn around his head to indicate that his Spidey sense is tingling, or indicating that his head really reeks. Yadda yadda yadda, it’s all fun stuff. But I hate him anyway.     Such is the nature of the irrational hatred - it makes no sense, and yet there it is.      But no matter how much of a swinging fruit the Spiderman character may seem to me, even I have to admit that two mahvelous things are born from the Spidey franchise - Spidey video games and Spidey movies.      ***Spoiler Alert!***  What I write next may include plot points and surprises in the movie, so don’t read on unless you’ve already seen the movie, or if you simply don’t care what you find out.  ***End Spoiler Alert.  Thank you.***      Much of the beginning of the movie focuses on how much it sucks being Peter Parker. He can’t get any action from Mary Jane - oh, on a side note, the movie makers once again find an excuse to get Kirsten Dunst soaking wet and in a pastel-colored dress.    Anyways, no sweet, sweet nookie with Mary Jane Stiffnipples, ‘cause he’s afraid that once he introduces her to his real webshooter, she’ll be captured by some super-powered nutbag who’ll use her as bait with which to lure Spidey into a well-choreographed fight sequence. As it turns out, Mary Jane gets captured anyway, and Captain Blueballs’ efforts are for naught. He should have known better; no one escapes the well-choreographed fight sequence. No one.    Parker’s life sucks on the financial end as well. His Aunt May is about to lose her house, because for some reason being skill-less and decrepit just doesn’t pay the bills. Aunt May’s nephew isn’t doing any better, ‘cause he can’t even hold a pizza delivery gig.     Now that’s one of the things that really bugged me (shit, no pun intended) about Spiderman. He’s supposed to be a really smart dude; especially smart in the comic book, ‘cause he actually designed his webslingers and the web-splooge he loads them with. He’s this master of science, so what does he do for a living? He’s a mediocre photographer who has to deliver pizzas on the side in order to pay the rent for his crappy apartment. Even for comic books, it just doesn’t make much sense. And when comic books make less sense than normal, then you know you’ve got a problem.      All of this crap and bad luck eventually has dire effects on Spidey’s superpowers. Kinda like superhero impotence. The stress of his personal life (which, oddly enough, seemed to be greater than the stress of fighting killers and dodging bullets on a day-to-day basis) prevented him from being able to perform when he had to.     This Spidey-impotence leads to some of the funniest scenes in the movie.    In one scene, Spidey is swinging around New York when all of a sudden his webshooting ability stops working. In mid-swing, he starts shooting blanks. So Spidey lets loose the funniest shriek of terror ever (yes, admit it, in the right circumstances a shriek of terror can be hysterical) and crashes hard onto a rooftop.     This occurs at least a handful of times throughout the movie - Parker’s failing powers cause him to fall repeatedly. He tries to swing again, and he falls into a filthy alley. He tries to crawl up a wall, then slips off and crashes against a dumpster. While fighting Doc Ock, his webbing fails, and as a result he literally gets bagged.    The funniest one of all is when he tests out his super-duper long jump and tries to jump from one roof to another in a single bound, which of course has hysterical effect. For those of you who’ve seen the movie, then you should know exactly what I’m talking about. For those who haven’t, then I won’t spoil this one. Trust me, you’ll know the scene when you see it.    Naturally, Parker overcomes his psychological inhibitors in the end and saves the day. He whoops the ass of Alfred Molina (cool actor, by the way, and he played the part quite well), he gets the girl, he mends his torn tights, and he stops shooting blanks.    Interestingly enough, this movie wasn’t particularly action-packed. I mean, sure there was a lot of action, but it wasn’t like that piece of shit ‘XXX’ with Vin Diesel, where it was nothing but action scene followed by action scene. Spiderman 2 was, like just about all of the current Marvel movies, very character driven, and a surprising amount of the film was dedicated to emotional insight and relationship development.     The fact that these more serious scenes melded well with the comic book thrill scenes - so well, in fact, that the pace of this two and a half hour movie doesn’t falter once - is probably testament to how much director Sam Raimi freakin’ rules. I guess I shouldn’t have expected anything less from the director / writer / producer of three of my favorite movies (Army of Darkness not being least among them), and director / writer / producer / whatever of some of the best goofy t.v. series ever: Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Xena: Warrior Princess, Jack of All Trades, among others.    I’d have to say that Spiderman 2 is the best comic-book based movie I have yet to see. Awesome director. Excellent cast (when you have Bruce Campbell doing a cameo, the cast automatically rules). Witty and overall superb dialogue (some of the best lines are J. K. Simmons’, the guy playing J. J. Jameson, and also the voice of the retarded M&amp;M in the commercials). And, perhaps most important of all, an excellent story that stayed true to the comic book.     As far as I’m concerned, that’s the key to making a comic book-based movie that’s not only successful but also, in essence, a damn good film. Just stay true to the freakin’ comic. Batman, Spiderman, Superman - these are all comics and characters that have been around for decades. Hundreds of people have contributed to the quality of these comics over the years - writers, visual artists, developers, and of course the fans. Decades of character development and plotlines and such are there to draw upon.     The best comic book movies are the ones whose makers actually draw from this wealth of knowledge, expertise and history; the ones whose makers are probably comic book nerds themselves.     The worst comic book movies are the ones that just take the name of a franchise and basically nothing else, in hopes that big name stars and a familiar character are all that’s needed to make money. I got a feeling that the upcoming ‘Catwoman’ movie is going to be one of the biggest piles of crap in the history of crap piles.    But I have no reason to complain, provided some movie makers get it right, as with Spiderman 2. If the makers of the upcoming Batman movie get it right as well, then I’ll really have no reason to complain.    Whatever the case, it's currently a good time to be a movie fan who also happens to enjoy comic books.  Yes indeedy.      Oh, one final note:    Alfred Molina thoks Spiderman with a big metal pipe towards the end of the movie.    When I saw that, I couldn't help but ask myself, 'Why?' Apparently the four titanium tentacles, each one powerful enough to lift or crush a car, just weren't enough, and the big ole lead pipe had to fill the gap.    The only way that scene would have been funnier was if Doc Ock was wielding a sap in one of his tentacles. Or a shotgun. There's an understated comedic value to both the sap and the shotgun.

      So far I’ve been in only three theaters here in Los Angeles.  But each one was cool in its own way; and one of them kicks an especially copious amount of ass.  The very first movie theater I visited here was the one in a place called The Grove, which is this open-air mall located ten minutes down the road from my apartment complex.  In The Grove’s theater, a suspicion that was nagging at me was confirmed - going to the movies is freakin’ expensive in LA.  Matinees are about 8 bucks no matter where you go, and prime time movie tickets can cost over 10.  LA is, naturally, an excellent place to be when you’re a movie fan.  But man oh man, it’s gonna cost ya.  The Grove theater was nice.  The interior was made to look like one of them ritzy, fancy-schmancy non-movie theaters, the likes of which you’re likely to find on Broadway.  So it’s complete with maroon carpeting (I can’t explain why, but when I think of fancy-schmancy theaters, I automatically think of a sea of maroon carpeting with little, gray or blue spade designs all over it), a marble staircase leading from the lobby to the second floor, and hollow, wooden pillars to complete the upscale facade.    This theater, which looks deceptively small from the outside, sports coliseum seating much like the Loews theaters I frequent back in the Jersey area.  Surround sound, cushy seats, big honkin’ cup holders for you to fit the big honkin’ bathtub-sized soda you paid a week’s salary to get...the usual amenities today’s movie-goers have grown to expect.  Cool theater.  The second theater I’ll mention is the Sunset 5 on Sunset Boulevard.  The building itself isn’t that impressive.  Small theaters, small seats, one concession stand.  I guess I’ve been spoiled by the era of the multiplex; I’ve come to think that if it doesn’t have coliseum seating, recliner-like seats, and a snack bar every five steps, then it’s a mediocre theater.    But the theater itself didn’t attract my attention.  What lead me to the Sunset 5 is the fact that it’s one of many Laemmle Theaters - a chain of movie houses in the LA area that show independent movies, foreign language cinema, and da classics.  The Sunset 5 and its brethren show movies like the following:  ‘The Tale of the Weeping Camel’ - a story about an albino camel that gets rejected by its mother but embraced by the humans that helped in its birth.  ‘The Singing Forest’ - a story about gay Nazi love and reincarnation.  I mean, jeez, as if we haven’t seen that movie a thousand times before.  ‘Union Square’ - a documentary about heroin junkies in New York.  Joel Siegel has already dubbed it the feel good movie of the Summer.  And, to my glee, there are Westerns.  The Sunset 5 and other Laemmle Theaters will be showing such influential and generally ass-whoopin’ Western classics as ‘High Noon,’ ‘Shane,’ ‘The Searchers,’ and, of course, ‘A Fistful of Dollars.’ So that’s why the Sunset 5 rules.  Now, the mother of all theaters - perhaps the coolest theater I’ve ever been to and will ever go to - is the Arclight Theater, also on Sunset.  The Arclight Theater has impressed and tickled me for several reasons.  For starters, it’s location rocks.  It’s across the street from the Los Angeles Film School, which means that when I catch a movie there, I’m often surrounded by film geeks who may actually be watching ‘Shrek 2' for homework.  Also across the street is a Jack in the Box, so if I don’t feel like taking out a loan in order to get myself a tubba popcorn and a pop, then I could just walk across the street and get myself a 99 cent taco or a double bacon cheeseburger for a couple dollars more.  The interior of the Arclight is something I’ve never seen before in a movie theater.  The lobby has a café instead of a concession stand.  Also in the lobby is a gift shop filled with books about films and interesting cinema-related knick-knacks.  Before watching a movie, you can spend a few minutes flipping through a guide of foreign films of 2004, or browsing through a book that details the history of the James Bond films.    The Arclight’s theaters are big.  Bigger than any I’ve ever been in.  And the surround sound is liable to blow your brains right out of your ass.  Seating in the Arclight also rocks.  When you purchase your ticket, you also choose which seat you want.  Towards the front and in the center, three seats towards the middle, all the way in the back by the wall, etc.  So everyone watching any given movie knows precisely where they’re going to be sitting before the movie has even started, and hopefully the seats they chose were to their liking.  Booya.  In front of the Arclight is the historic Cinemadome.  It’s historic ‘cause it’s old, which is the gist of what I learned about its background.  The Dome is freakin’ huge, even larger than the already impressive theaters in the Arclight proper.  And when a uber-hyped movie comes out, the Dome is decorated to match that particular hype.  For instance, during the Shrek 2 phase, an enormous green condom with ogre ears was stretched over the dome, thus making it look as though Shrek’s severed scalp had been placed right there on Sunset Boulevard for all the kiddies to see and enjoy.  And this week, what with all the Spiderman hullabaloo, they put a giant balloon Spiderman right on top of the Dome, thus increasing its level of gay to unprecedented heights.    One of the funnier things about the Arclight is that you can hear movie music in the bathroom.  You know, movie music: the Indiana Jones theme; chick flick love ballads; suspense music you'd hear in a Hitchcock thriller; etc.  You can hear it being played softly in the lobby, but for some reason it's significantly louder in the men's room.  So one day in the Arclight bathroom, while listening to something grand and epic, probably something composed by John Williams, I took the most adventurous whiz I ever had. 									 Finally, there’s the movies.  The Arclight does movies right.				  They have something called ‘Master Storytellers.’  On Tuesdays and / or Wednesdays (which corresponds beautifully with my days off), a popular and perhaps classic movie is shown, and someone important to the making of that movie is invited to stop by and talk about the movie before and after the viewing.    A couple of weeks ago, I spent Tuesday night watching, ‘Star Trek: First Contact.’  Invited to the showing was Brannon Braga, one of the writers and producers of the movie and the show.  The pre- and post-movie interview kinda sucked, ‘cause the interviewer sucked, but I was tickled by the idea that I was watching this transpire, nevertheless.  I was reminded of ‘Inside the Actor’s Studio’ with James Lipton.  Only instead of an auditorium full of film nerds, there were Trekkie dorks instead.  I don’t know which group of people is funnier.  The following night, I saw ‘This is Spinal Tap,’ for the first time.  This wasn’t labeled a ‘Master Storytellers’ event, but who turned out to be the unannounced guest for the evening?  Harry freakin’ Shearer.  Unlike the other night, this interview session was both enlightening and entertaining, not only because the interviewer wasn’t asking stupid questions, but because the guest was, well, Harry freakin’ Shearer..  He spent the time proving why he rules, and he ended the interview by doing Simpson voices.  Booyaka.  Next month, they’re showing ‘Porky’s’ with Bob Clark, the director.  All is well.  For these reasons, and many more that I’ve either forgotten or have yet to discover, the Arclight kicks the most ass.  I’m sure to explore and try out more of the many, many movie houses in the area.  But I doubt anyone will knock my socks off like the Arclight.   Oh, on a final note, while watching ‘The Terminal’ in the Dome, I saw Eric Idle.  Now that was fooked up.

      I've subscribed to Netflix.  I can't help but wonder why I hadn't done this earlier.  Netflix is ideal for someone like me.  Before signing up, I attained membership cards in two Los Angeles video rental place dealie thingies - first, a Hollywood Video.  (A Hollywood Video in LA?  Who'd a thunk it?)   And then I got a membership in a place that's right around the corner from my apartment.  The Hollywood Video is on the corner of Western and Santa Monica, which is a 15 minute drive from my place when traffic is bad.  And since I'm really ultra super lazy about things like returning videos, unless the place is within walking distance like the second store I mentioned, I'm going to accrue late fees.  Which is exactly what happened.  Hell, I almost returned movies to the place around the corner late, which should really show how bad I am with these things.  But now I'm a Netflix member.  Movies come to me, and when I'm done I just pop them into a envelope, sans stamp, and mail it back for my next selection.  Speaking of selection, the reason I signed up to Netflix without really mulling it over was because of its selection.  I've been meaning to watch more anime, samurai films, films by Akira Kurosawa, and more foreign films in general.  Netflix has just about every single freakin' movie I've had on my mental things-I've-gotta-watch-list.  That rules.  My first 8 selections are the 8 DVDs that cover the entire Neon Genesis: Evangelion series, not including the two Neon Genesis movies.  After that, I go into a couple Kurosawa films, a couple of Miyazaki animes I hadn't seen, then random schtuff I've been meaning to watch.  Yep, being a Netflix member helps when you're on the road to becoming a movie fanatic.  Living near Hollywood doesn't hurt none, either.

      I had been meaning to watch 'Grave of the Fireflies' for a long time, and recently I finally got around to doing so.  I'm both happy and sad that I did.  Let's just say that 'Grave of the Fireflies' is one fooked up movie.    *** Spoiler Alert ***  I'm about to reveal the ending and much of the plot of this movie.  Granted, it isn't much of a spoiler in this case, since the end is more or less given away within the first five minutes of the movie.  It's just like "American Beauty,' in which the main character clearly states that he's dead before the movie is through.  Anyhoos...   The movie is based on the book  Hotaru no Haka  by Akiyuki Nosaka.  It (the book, not necessarily the anime) is a semi-autobiographical account of Nosaka's childhood in Japan towards the end of World War II.  The setting should've given me fair warning that this wasn't going to be a happy happy sunshine movie, but like an idiot I watched it through anyway in hopes of a good time.  The story outlines the struggles of Seita and his 4-year old sister Setsuko.  In the beginning of the movie, we see their home town firebombed by US forces.  Seita, with Setsuko strapped firmly to his back, runs frantically through the streets whilst dodging large chunks of what look to be burning, red-hot metal.  He makes it to the bomb shelter without a wound to either himself or his sister, but their home, as well as the homes of their neighbors, have all been burned to ash.  To make matters worse, their mom dies in the attack.  And their father is an officer in the Japanese navy.  So within the first 15 minutes, we see that the likable Seita and the adorable Setsuko have been orphaned (the father's death isn't confirmed until the end, but it doesn't take a much to guess that).   So Seita and Setsuko go to live with a distant relative, who's a real bitch to them.  Seita had just seen a loved one die slowly after suffering severe burns, and the two of them had just seen their childhood home burned to the ground, and yet the relative they were stuck with couldn't find it in her heart to treat them kindly.  Things just go down hill from there, believe it or not.  After being fed up with the relative, Seita hatches up a plan to live in an abandoned shelter.  He takes Setsuko, moves all their stuff out of their aunt's place, and they just set up shop in a swamp-side cave.  They do just fine for a little while.  But soon they run out of food, and they have to resort to theft and foraging through the wilderness to survive.  When Setsuko's health inevitably deteriorates, Seita pleads for help from the local doctors and farmers, but they prove to be appaulingly apathetic to their plight.  Eventually, Setsuko dies of malnutrition.  I figure there's a lesson to be learned here.  Maybe something that has to do with pride, 'cause Seita could have averted his sister's death if he had only sucked up his pride and endured his distant aunt's constant verbal abuse.  But he didn't.  He chose living in a swamp cave over getting tongue-lashed by an old hag, and because of it both he and his sister died of starvation.   Maybe it's a metaphor for what Japan suffered at the end of WWII.  With its allies defeated, Japan refused to surrender.  It took the massacre of the country's innocents to persuade its leaders to finally call it quits.  So maybe Setsuko was, in one way or another, a representation of all the innocents that died needlessly in the name of war and pride.   But whatever the reasoning is behind this ending, the movie is a real heart breaker.  I guess, in the end, I'm glad I watched it.  But man, next time I want to watch an anime, it'll have to be anime porn or something by Miyazaki.   Speaking of which, here's a bit of random trivia.  When 'Grave of the Fireflies' was first released in Japan, it came as part of a double feature.  The second feature was none other than 'My Neighbor Totoro' by Miyazaki.  It's kinda like taking your kids to the theater to watch a double feature with 'Shrek 2' immediately followed by 'The Passion of the Christ.'
