      i'm finding my inspiration currently in a very important, intellectual, world renowned book, a classic in it's own right...namely, "oh, the places you'll go!" by dr. seuss.  seriously, this man was a genius.    for instance - "with you heard full of brains and your shoes full of feet, you're too smart to go down any not-so-good street."    or perhaps - "i'm sorry to say so but, sadly, it's true that bang-ups and hang-ups can happen to you...you'll come down from the lurch with an unpleasant bump.  and the chances are, then, that you'll be in a slump.  and when you're in a slump, you're not in for much fun.  un-slumping yourself is not easily done."  i stumbled upon this book on accident.  someone gave it to me back a few years when i graduated from college, at which point i was far far too busy to read it, but now, reading it inspires me.  makes me laugh.  relieves some of my anxiety.  and you know, i get all of this from a children's book.  perhaps this speaks volumes about me, some of you may think, as i myself have wondered, but you know, more accurately, i just think that dr. seuss knew his shit and his knowledge and works are universally applicable to all, regardless of race, age, gender, sex, social status and what not...and i like that right now about him.  that, and of course, he made me laugh and smile, two of my very favorite things to do.  moving on...my 3 year old nephew is again calling me aunt sally, instead of aunt trisha.  see, the story goes like this.  a while ago, last summer i think, i taught my beloved and gifted nephew how to give wet willies (wet finger, stick in ear...not your own ear silly.), something my brother has yet to forgive me for.  anyhow, while i was away at school, my nephew practiced with great diligence his wet willies, generally on my brother.  my brother, being my very favorite person in this world, decided to get revenge by renaming me "aunt sally" and teaching his son to call me such.  now, he started this a couple of months ago, and i thought i had reversed such teachings, but upon arriving today at their house, i was greeted by an adorable grinning nephew calling me aunt sally.  sigh.  (still cute though, huh?)  alright, it is getting a bit late, and i need to get some sleep, since i am actually working SIX days this week.  and that is exciting.  and absolutely necessary according to my checking account.

      yesterday, little baby gaberoo was in town and that was good.  we ran around a bit, watched shrek (which is so super cute and very appropriate  for adults) and then settled into my top priority...primarily eating dinner and drinking beer.  now, back in the day, namely undergrad, i was much less fun.  i didn't drink beer.  i was one of those very annoying girls who would only drink certain types of hard alcohol and would much rather prefer only certain types of hard cider.  i was truly a pain in the ass to drink with.  however, in law school, i made an effort to become more versatile and easy going...in essence, i learned to drink beer and consequently became more fun.  so, last night i started drinking with my favorite beer...miller light.  i love the stuff, can't help it.  but i tend to fall back on it so heavily that i don't ever stray.  it gets boring.  anyhow, at the second and most fun bar of the night, i met a stranger while gabe was off to the bathroom.  this stranger so graciously introduced me to new beer, bells oberon.  it was great.  resulted in me, gabe and our new friend (a fellow msu alum and local realtor) being very drunk swapping old stories from college.  also resulted in this man pinching my cheeks repeatedly telling me how very cute i was and if he wasn't already in love, he would surely be in love with me.  it was very amusing, especially for me, but for baby gabe too.  the guy was just so genuine and so very excited to have found gabe and i, it just made the night that much better.  good people.  really, it was a great night.  fun times.  exactly what i needed to alleviate any worries or anxieties.  went through taco bell that night, but didn't actually remember eating a taco until i went to run to get my soy chai this morning and discovered an abandoned taco bell bag.  instantly felt guilty about eating the taco that late at night which resulted in such great guilt that i had to compulsively go for a run to keep the unnecessary guilt at bay.  it is ridiculous, i know, but i just can't help it quite yet.  anyhow, later in the evening, after gabe headed back home and after the bars were closed, i got an interesting phone call from someone who should know better than to call me...especially considering that he is certainly not single.  anyhow, it was an interesting phone conversation which could have potential to create an interesting summer.  we'll have to see how that works out.    alright folks, off to be tired from a compounded lack of sleep from the past few nights.

      i am seriously exhausted.  i forgot how tiring waitressing is.  now, i know that sounds stupid, it isn't like i am running a marathon or moving massive quantities of weight, but seriously, i was just on my feet for over 10 hours, serving alcohol and food.  now i want nothing more than to go to bed and forget about the drunks hitting on me in a manner so as to distract me from their attempts to grope me.  seriously, those drunks telling me i am beautiful only grosses me out...i'd much rather here it from my nephew, who although he is three and not the most worldly of folks, is still more intelligent and coherent than those alcoholics i serve at the bar.  yeah, i can't go to bed.  i can't go to bed because i have to go to the damn hospital.  i have to go to the hospital because my kindeys suck and aren't working correctly, which has now turned painful and necessitates getting an ultrasound, amongst other fun tests.  and that ultrasound will be taking place in about an hour...at five am.  why five am?  who knows.  so funny though, while confirming the five am appointment, the nurse asked me to please come early, given the rush.  i just sat there, dumbfounded, wondering why there was a rush at five in the freakin' morning.  i, of course, asked her if it was really all that busy at that hour, but she just didn't seem to think it was that ironic or funny.  where are people's senses of humor?  their wit?  their sarcasm?  honestly.  this is why i dislike so many people.    what sucks even more is that i can't eat prior to this thingy for at least six hours.  six hours really isn't all that long to go without food or drink, but i didn't have a chance to eat while at work, so i haven't actually eaten in 13 hours and i haven't had anything to drink in 8.  i am a little bitter.    so, really, just to be completely honest here, which i can do, given this is my site and my blog, i'll tell you something.  i am scared.  i am.  i don't like hospitals.  rarely can i remember getting good news at the hospital.  especially in the last few years, with my grams being sick with cancer.  and obviously, i don't have cancer (at least i damn well better not), so i realize that i need not be that extreme, but still, hospitals don't have a positive place in my mind.  much more of a negative connotation, which leads me to be nervous, anxious and scared.  three things that probably only succeed in further agitating my already high blood pressure.    gabe comes to visit tomorrow and this is good.  he always makes me feel better, given he does possess wit and sarcasm.  i'm sure that will be a good thing.  alright all.  i'd say good night, but really, this isn't such a night and i am not even going to bed.  so, good day tomorrow instead!

      right, sorry i forgot!  so, the other day, i was running along on the treadmill here in the house, in the basement, watching regis and kelly, trying to burn extra calories, when i glanced up and saw this face smooched (i don't know how to spell smooched)up against the window, with hands cupping around it.  i then saw the freakin' scary toothless grin and seriously was so scared, upon realizing it was the pyscho builder, that i misstepped and fell off the back of the treadmill.  i can not even begin to tell you how enraged i was.  i just sat there, head hurting, treadmill treading, thinking about how i was so calling my brother to beat this weirdo up.  seriously, pyscho!  stop staring at me in the shower and on the treadmill.  agh.  he is like a stalker with a permit, given his necessity as builder.  ick.  on another funny note, i have again realized why i am not quite ready to be a mom.  while babysitting today, i packed up the small children, car seats and all, into the saturn.  i then packed myself in.  as i am pulling out, i hear a loud thud, and realize i have run over something.  i worry, then realize it couldn't have been a child, since both were in the car...instead it was the diaper bag.  nice.  i ran over the diaper bag, which mind you, i would have forgotten had i not hit it.  seriously, who trusts me to babysit?

      so, woke up unnaturally early to the phone.  yeah, some semi-scary news from my newly acquired family doctor, otherwise known as gabe's dad.  anyhow, high blood pressure aside, things look slightly more colorful, so further testing has to be done aided by a specialist.  not so excited about this development, but whatever.  can't do much to avoid it.    anyhow, after that type of waking up, i was a bit stressed, so babysitting for the niece and nephew was perfect, given all the fort building and other fun things to partake in.  plus, my nephew, in his three years of wisdom, has determined that not only am i the most beautiful (pronounced bee-u-tiful) girl he knows, but also one of the smartest.  i earned the title of smartest when i was able to dislodge his finger from the vcr that he had stuck it in.  silly boy.  anyhow, 12 hours with those two totally occupies your mind, not allowing one to worry about much else besides keeping the kids with all their fingers and toes, at least until the parent get home.  it was a good time and good for me.  like i said, there was fort building, one of my all time favorite activities still.  additionally, we also had some fun at the river and swinging in the park.  i haven't swung in so long...i tried for a big dismount, going as far as to call out to my nephew and brother to get their attention, yeah, then i ate shit in the woodchips.  hey, it was good for the laughs and humbling for the ego.  i now can cross off a future as a gymnast.    what else?  i start work waitressing tomorrow, which is fantastic.  i need to make some serious money, and short of selling myself or taking off my clothes, this might be my best option, so let's all wish me luck.  no need for me to go to extremes.    alright boys and girls.  i need to go and relax.  perhaps shower off some of the dirty hand prints that are scattered all over me, given the two small children i spent the day with.  more another time.

      i am frustrated.  can't so much pin point the exact source of frustration, or the exact person(s) that i am letting frustrate me, but if i just think about it long enough i might figure it out...or i might just get more frustrated.  i think the bottom line is that people annoy me.  or more accurately, boys annoy me.  i need to stop allowing them to frustrate me.  note to self.  i can tell you that i am not frustrated by a lack of things to do today.  instead, i was busy.  i got called into one of my many past jobs, this one at the salon, where i am the perky welcoming face to the clients.  or at least that is my goal.  so, i worked there.  and that was good, because otherwise i would have had to sit in the beautiful house i can't enjoy because the pyscho builder who stares in showers was here not doing his job.  he is kinda a bad builder, all things considered.  and he doesn't have all his teeth.  yeah, i better not even get going on him.  scary scary man.    tomorrow i am babysitting for previously mentioned adorable niece and nephew.  this i am excited about.  this is of course a volunteer position, but it is one of my favorite things to do, so i am good with the lack of monetary reimbursement.  at least for the time being.  visa may have qualms, but whatever.    it didn't rain today!  yeah for no rain!  now if only i can convince the sun to shine...  alright, i am exhausted.  must have been the real work i did versus reading books and drinking chai.  whew.

      right.  so, i've never blogged.  i didn't actually really know such a word as blog existed, let alone that it was classified as a verb, but whatever.  live and learn.  gabe recommended i start this.  really, i figure it is like cheap therapy.  gabe probably figures it will decrease his cell phone bills and perhaps allow him more time to sleep...as if that is what he needs, can the kid possibly sleep more?  anyhow, this should be interesting.  and given that i don't really know how this works or what blogging etiquette is, i'm just going to wing it.  and start with the happens of my life as of late.  although, it seems so odd to just sit and talk about myself, not that i don't do it well and frequently anyhow, but normally i interject the customary and polite "so, how are you doing?" every so often, not necessarily because i care (although sometimes with some people i do really care), but because it is rude not to.  but here, really, i don't have to do that...at least not as far as i know.  wow, feeling really free right now.    so, i am done with my second year of law school at gonzaga and thus home in michigan for the summer.  it has rained every day, except one, since i have gotten here.  i remember missing the thunderstorms while i was out west, but now i am just tired of them waking me up all night.  they can stop now.  i've had my fill.    i'm excited to be home because a. it means i am done with school for the year (which might alleviate my now scarily high blood pressure), b. i get to see my niece and nephew, whom i adore and who adore me still, given their young age and innocence, and c. i love summers in michigan (lake michigan, traverse city, canoeing, camping, running outside, s'mores, bonfires...).  so, it is good to be home.  for the most part.  not good is the fact that we just built a new house, so it is chaotic.  chaotic in the sense that last week i was in the new sweet ass shower, showering away, doing what one does in the shower.  as i am getting out of the shower, and drying off, i glance out of the very high and not easily accessible window, only to make eye contact with the scary and semi-toothless man working on the siding, evidently.  i was so disgusted, that i bolted out of the bathroom, attempting to cover myself with my towel.  ick.  gross.  how long was that freak staring at me?    i start working this week, which is fantastic, because i am going absolutely crazy with all my free time.  i am not a free time lover.  i am actually the opposite.  i love the be busy.  scheduled.  running from here to there.  all this free time leaves me feel rather unproductive and somewhat of a waste of space.  take today for example.    i woke up, early as always, and then realized i had nothing to do.  literally.  so, i ran double the miles to take up double the time...all in an effort to feel productive.  i then went to a coffee house and drank two soy chai lattes while reading a book (not an intellectual book, on break from those until school starts again) from cover to cover, taking all of about two hours.  so, then, feeling very lazy, i decided to re-enter society as a productive citizen by donating blood.  i have o- blood, so they always want it.  yeah, even that was a bust.  my veins sucked and the poor nurse just ended up getting mad and bruising my entire arm.  so, really, now i look like a freakin' drug addict with a bruised up arm.  nice, huh?  kinda achieved the exact opposite of what i was looking to do.  on the upside, i felt slightly redeemed upon arriving at my aunt's house and being able to help my cousin with his math homework.  actually felt helpful and intelligent...right, until i realized he was in the freakin' fourth grade and i had damn well better know how to do mixed numbers and improper fractions after this much education and looming debt.  shortly after that helpful spurt, i attempted to run an errand that was requested of me, which simply led to me being lost in flowerland amongst the overwhelming varieties of flora and fauna.  kinda scary really, given that i knew i had a specific variety (marigolds, yellow, not orange...i was bitter) to find, yet was totally lost.  some awkward teenage boy finally ended up helping me, but really, he just made me more uncomfortable, given his complete lack of eye contact.  why is there no eye contact?  seriously.  so, yeah, that was my day.  exciting, huh?  tomorrow is looking very similar.  i might go insane.  it is clearly possible that i might be nuts by thursday, when i finally start my job waitressing.  i'll have to clean or something tomorrow.  that might do the trick.  either way, i'll keep you up to date on my mental stability...or lack thereof.

      i might have a one way ticket to hell.  or at least dating hell.  (for those of you who aren't familiar with my random thoughts on hell, i separate various hells.  for example, people who are bad friends go to friend hell.  people who are bad with their families go to family hell.  and so on and so forth.)  so, it is currently dating hell for me.    see, there is this guy at work who is fun and who i do like, but only in the short term, let's hang out and not be serious sense.  certainly not in the "wow, you are awesome and i want to spend lots of time with you for an undetermined amount of time."  so, while i am interested in short and low key, he appears to be more interested in the more serious option.  so....what do i do?  oh, it's easy.  i say yes when he asks me to do something, regardless of if i want to or not (it's easier than saying no and making him feel badly...frelled up, i know, but one of my issues) and then if i decide i REALLY don't want to do whatever it is i have committed to, i just call and cancel.  case and point - i was supposed to go to a movie tonight with him, but i just called and feigned a friend emergency that necessitated my attention immediately.  now, i wouldn't normally mind going to a movie, but i did just hang out with him last night for several hours (a long time) and don't really feel that i want to hang out with him again already.  but instead of telling him all of this, as clearly i should have, i fibbed.  or lied.  thus, i will be in dating hell.  in case anyone is looking for me.  on an unrelated note, i didn't make it home last night, due to some alcohol consumption.  so, this morning, when i rolled in the house, stumbling in my jeans, pointy shoes and tank top, reeking of a mix of miller light, oberon and jager, seeing maggie in the entry way waiting for me was the last thing i wanted.  but yeah, she was there anyhow.  arms crossed and scold securely fastened upon her face.  agh.  yeah, she wasn't really mad, just more concerned.  (bear in mind, i live all the way across the country eight months out of the year where she has NO idea what i am doing or when i am coming home, but that appears to be irrelevant.)  anyhow, instead of going promptly to bed (i had accumulated TWO hours of sleep by eight am) as i really really wanted to, i sucked it up, sprayed some perfume and joined family sunday morning, which consists of getting chai (me) and lattes (mags and carrol) before wandering through the grocery store buying various things for the large family brunch that followed.  yeah, that was a real treat.

      yeah, i really don't have much to note, however, out of a sense of some sort of obligation, i'll scrounge up the fun events of the last few days and splice them together in an attempt to offer some entertainment.  alright, so got done with work saturday night a bit early, say around midnight.  ran into one of my brother's best friends there, so a good friend of mine as well, drinking...so, i pulled up a chair at the bar and commenced drinking some bell's oberon myself.  well, about two beers later, i ran into a good friend of mine from the restaurant, so we joined her and continued our beer consumption.  now, lest we all forget (as i did saturday night) that the kidney/blood pressure medicine that i am taking kills my drinking tolerance and renders me pretty wasted in about four beers time.  but i was doing good, only being on my third beer, when alisa and i looked up and saw a neat little row of three shots each, or six shots total, of tequila (specifically, jose 151) lined up in front of us.  i looked quickly at her, getting ready to accuse her of such bad taste, when we both noticed our head boss, the owner of this and other restaurants and bars, toasting us with his own shot.  agh.  sigh.  i briefly wrestled in my own mind with whether or not one could refuse shots (3 shots.  of jose 151.  ick.) bought for them by their boss.  yeah, i realized you can't.  so, we took all three like the little troopers we are.  and were absolutely retarded from that point on.  this is her and i, running, drunk, around the very same bar we work at, trying to do this and that.  one of our tasks was an attempt to fix a vacuum, but in actuality, it wasn't broken until we started fixing it.  never good.  according to bystanders, the result was not only a broken vacuum, but alisa and i were also discovered to be hiding under a booth pretending that we were camping and roasting marshmallows.  who the hell knows really.  anyhow, was obviously in no shape to drive the entire mile and a half home, so had to have my brother's buddy drop me off.  rather embarrassing at the age of 24 really.  and certainly certainly woke up with a raging hangover yesterday morning.  ick.  hate tequila.    now, this morning, woke up sans the hangover, but with an 87 year old in the house.  maggie's aunt kay is here visiting, so at nine am i got to meet this gem of a women (no sarcasm, she really is quite interesting).  i, of course, being the lazy person i am, was, and really honestly, am still in my pajamas, but she was not only already dressed for the day, in her dress, but also had full make up on.  seriously, i don't wear make up, but the least i could have done was probably get dressed.  oh well, life goes on i imagine.  can't really help it when one is out performed by an 87 year old suffering from jet lag from her cross country flight.  i mean, honestly, the woman surely has a clear advantage of me...considering my age of 24, my bed time of earlier than hers and my lengthy commute of a mile and a half to and home from work.  right.  i suck.  okay, enough.  the best i have to offer right now, due to my obvious stressful and uber important lifestyle.  uh huh, feel free to laugh.

      so, in an effort to be responsible and realize my limitations, especially right now in my life, i went to the obgyn today to get a depo shot, to ensure i would be producing no small children anytime soon.  sounds pretty simple, right?    WRONG!  honestly, i get there, early, fill out several forms all wanting random information that i am not entirely sure of, thus i end up being creative and making some of it up, which i have conflicted feelings about, but whatever.  moving on, i fill out the complicated forms, using my creative genius.  then i wait.  and wait.  and wait.  a long time mind you.  long enough to drink a venti soy extra hot no water chai.  and to read sixty five pages in my current book.  then i get called back.  and once i am back there, things move just as slowly.  they consult my chart.  note that i have high blood pressure and kidney issues (still unclear about those, but again, whatever).  note that i have a consent form from a nephrologist that i have never actually seen yet, but again, whatever.  they take my blood pressure, noting that while it is indeed lower than last time, it is still high, almost too high to give me the shot.  so, they tell me to take several deep breaths and to calm down.  picture yourself in a serene spot.  uh huh...my serene spot at that time included me with a gaggle of children surrounding me all whining and crying due to my lack of birth control.    right, so let me get this straight.  you want me to relax.  to calm down.  but yet, you are telling me that i might not be able to get the damn shot which i want so that i don't have any small children in the near future?!  right, well, no pressure there.  honestly.  anyhow, after three more readings of the blood pressure, i think the nurse fudged it to the doctor, sympathizing with me greatly, ensuring that i could get the shot and not reproduce for awhile.  i really appreciated this, given that my anxiety was only increasing with the repeated blood pressure tests.  anyhow, after such an ordeal, i was finally allowed the treat of getting a shot squarely in my arse (the book i am reading is by an english author...the use of arse is a shout out to that...almost used blimey, but i am unsure of the actual meaning, whereas arse i understand), which hurt quite a bit.    and just to make things so much better, the silly doctor informed me, just after she stuck me with the needle, that i need to be wary of weight gain on this particular method of birth control...agh!  i already run and work out, but now that i have to be even more careful, i will be all that more neurotic and obsessive.  hence the four mile hilly and hot run i went on as soon as i got home from the doctor's office.  i might be insane.  it is possible.  on unrelated fronts, the pistons won!  yeah!  i followed the tournament games pretty closely, and really enjoyed them.  watched the final one down in some totally desolate bar in sister lakes with gabe, but had a great time.  it was pretty much just him, me, and a couple of his buddies, drinking and watching the game.  and again, i have reconfirmed that the medicine for the blood pressure greatly hinders my drinking tolerance, rendering me wasted in about half the time.  ha, lucky gabe for having to deal with wasted me.  he does well though, must be all that experience with small foreign children...has given him good amounts of patience and a good ability to make peanut butter toast.  anyhow, fun times.  and now i feel the need to do some napping, due to the compulsive exercise.

      i am being plagued by crazy pyscho insane dreams.  seriously, i'm not sure if my random sleeping hours are to blame, because going to bed at four am consistently after working for twelve hours is a change, but nothing that odd.  or perhaps it is the kidney thing, which i wish i knew more about, but given my current lack of health insurance and not being millionaire, i can't go specialist until a later date, so due to a lack of a better explanation, i'm blaming the dreams on the kidneys.  damn kidneys.    anyhow, the dreams are just ridiculous.  in one i was being chased by nameless and unknown small children who are trying to steal my two teddy bears that i sleep with every night and have ever since i was three.  i'm torn in the dream, because there is no frelling way i'm giving up the bears, timmy teddy brown and hackley, but i also don't want to have to physically injure small children.  i keep waking up before it comes to any sort of blows...but i'm pretty sure i would have hurt them in order to keep the bears...seriously, i've had them since i was three.  those damn kids can get their own bears.  another entails me waiting on a table of seriously 65 people who all want something that i can't give them, whether it be as simple as pepsi, when all we have is coke.  or pitchers of beer on a sunday morning when according to state law i can't serve alcohol until noon.  it is just absolutely ridiculous, there are sixty five damn picky difficult mean people.  it must be a dream compiling all of my shitty watiressing experiences and putting all those people at one table.  either way, this dream just blows.  i end up getting seriously irate, yet trying to remain sweet and calm (which i don't really pull off all that well in real life, let alone when i am stressed and irate), but i think i eventually end up throwing a pitcher of coke at some asshole guy.    also had a dream where i was making out with a girl that i know from high school and people were watching, people i know too, not just random faces.  not totally odd and perhaps the least disturbing, but still ranking up on the a little weird list, given not that i was making out with a girl, that isn't all that odd, given the greater social acceptance of not only lesbian relationships, but of girls experimenting just for fun, even if they are straight (hell, cosmo just had an article about  girls kissing girls just for fun), but the fact that it was a girl that i haven't seen or even thought of in a good number of years...and when i was around her, i didn't even get along with her all that well (shocker, i know...i don't get along with all that many girls, honestly) is a little bit different.    perhaps the most stressful and perplexing is the dream where i am back in my elementary school, where evidently i go to law school.  in the dream i can't for the frelling life of me find my locker anywhere.  i am surrounded by all of these white lockers and i can't find mine anywhere.  i'm constrained by time, given i need to get to class, but i can't find the damn locker...and this is terrible for me.  i hate being lost in places by myself (hate it!  one of my biggest fears...) and i also hate hate hate being late for things.  and as my stress reaches new heights a boy that i have some history with from law school wanders up in an attempt to maybe help me (unsure, he's not real helpful in real life, so why would he be in dream life?  actually, in real life he is downright unhelpful although somewhat fun and amusing, but always when doing something that we both know is wrong)...so, he's distracting me, yet i still feel stressed.  i am worrying at this point not only about the missing locker, amongst the hundreds of white lockers to choose from, but also the class that i am surely late for.  then a boy, one of my favorite boys (i am the only girl that made him cry over a broken heart...back in the fifth grade and who shares the name matt, as so many boys in my life do), whom i have known since grade school appears...and i ditch the law school boy (feeling little guilt, if i remember correctly) and follow the favorite grade school boy, who leads me to my locker, alleviating my stress at the lost locker and pending class that i might have been missing.  what does this mean?  honestly.  i may need to get back to a therapist just to interpret my dreams.    this isn't a comprehensive list of all the strange dreams as of late, but it details the highlights...

      i love waitressing, i really do.  i kinda think of it as my dream screw off job...one of the reasons i love being a student, since it is completely acceptable to spend my summers waiting tables, but honestly, tonight i just wanted someone to get me a beer, preferably a miller light or an oberon...is that too much to ask?  yeah, it is, and honestly, that is okay, because i made good money.  the miller light reps were in the bar tonight handing out free beer and miller light stuff, always a treat to have flashing pins adorning your clothes (reminds me of flare, which reminds me of a great movie...office space).  anyhow, there were a couple of miller light girls there, who oddly enough also work for hooters here in town.  anyhow, got to chatting with one of them for a bit and at some point, she asked me if i was interested in quitting the sports bar scene and trying hooters out...yeah, i thanked her, but really, it isn't my scene.  so, now hooter's for me, but maybe as a fall back plan.  i hear that they have great wings.  right.  anyhow, the great thing about the sports bar atmosphere is that people are almost always there...given it is basketball finals, but also golf, car racing (my least favorite...so white trash), hockey...i even think the summer olympics are coming soon.  not to mention that i think some just come in for the in restaurant trivia...but regardless, it is a busy bar/restaurant and i benefit from that.  quite well, in the case of tonight.    had a good day, not only because of being profitable at work, but also had a good morning/afternoon prior to work.  got some good solid reading in while laying out in the sun (love michigan summers....especially now that the torrential rains have ceased) and also had a good fun visit with matt, a fun friend from undergrad, who just happened to be in town for something work related.  it was good to see him, brightened up my day.  anyhow, all around good times.  gabe and lois came up for dinner last night, which was quality.  went to one of the really pretty parts of grand rapids, sat out on a deck over looking a lake and drank some beer and ate some good food.  got to know lois better, which is great.  very glad she extended her stay so that i could actually meet and talk to her sober, versus the last time i met her.    alright, nothing real exciting...which for me is pretty damn good.  but off to bed....my feet are exhausted.  odd how just one part of the body feels the tiredness.

      some might say that i over analyze things.  not all things, but some things...frequently things and situations that do not really merit such thought.  and while some would say that, i would even venture to agree.  anyhow, lately i have had a slew of things stirring around in my mind, causing me some angst and others angst as well, generally because they had to listen and deal with me while i stewed.  anyhow, i am relieved to say that, yet again, that the powers that be have again proven that i am wasting a great deal of energy worrying sometimes.    i've had a busy few days.  i've been working crazy hours, going into the restaurant around four in the afternoon and getting out around three am.  it makes for a long day and a short night, given my complete inability to sleep later than eight.  but it is good, because i am making money and not giving myself as much opportunity to spend money.  always a bonus for me, given my talent at vastly under thinking my finances.  i had the pleasure of meeting lois a couple nights ago.  it was a good experience...gabe is one of my best friends and now i have a completed picture, or a more complete picture, of his life.  i understand the situation more and that is always a bonus.  plus, honestly, how could i turn down such a hoppin' bar in a hot bed of sister lakes?  i brought along a friend from undergrad and had a very memorable time, both at the bar and on the drive home...a very fun night, all things considered (all things considered being the loss of one of my favorite shoes...i think i surrendered it to the rest stop gods...but i can't really accurately recall.)  what else?  not much, honestly.  or at least nothing meriting a discussion.  hope all is well with everyone.  and on the off chance that anyone stops by a rest stop somewhere outside of the battle creek area and finds a black pointy shoe, it would be mine.

      well, i kinda constitute little miss smarty pants right now, but really only according to my own frelled (caleb, i am so stealing frelled from you, but i think it is incredibly creative and effective, so props to you.) standards.    bottom line, i just got my grades from this past semester of law school, and to my surprise and glee, i did well.  actually, (again according to my standards) i did really well.  i pulled all a's and high b's, with not a single b- or c of any sort in sight.  (kinda rhymes, which amuses me right now...but that might be the four hours of sleep i got.)  anyhow, i am thrilled.  it was a tough semester, with some hard classes.  i mean seriously, who really understands the federal rules of evidence?  who even cares to understand them?  certainly not myself, but i even got a good grade in that class as well.  but i actually studied this year and even overcame the ex of over six years dropping a bomb on me a wee two hours prior to one of the big exams, pulling in my second best grade in that class.  his news having such a small impact, if not perhaps no impact at all, somehow gives me the belief that i really am done with that chapter of my life, which is bittersweet, but right now, more sweet than bitter.  so, i am happy about this.  so happy in fact that i am going to treat myself to a soy chai.  yeah, but only after i go run in the rain.  i love running in the rain, primarily because i feel totally free to splash in the puddles and secondly because sometimes there are ducks out and i heart ducks.  quick flashback for you all...back in undergrad i studied abroad to england, scotland, ireland and france.  i believe somewhere in england our gang had gone on a tour of a very old castle in the pouring down english rain.  i was super excited though, because i kept seeing all of these amazing ducks all over the estate.  finally, after much meandering (because one meanders when in england) i stumbled upon a duckery!  (somewhat like a nunnery, but minus the nuns and plus ducks...or yeah, it was really a duck pond with a sign that said duckery.)  anyhow, i was SO happy about this.  it was absolutely necessary in my mind to get a picture of myself in front of the duckery...regardless of the pouring down rain.  so, i get positioned and am waiting for someone in the group to take to photo, but all of being hungover, things are moving slowly and in that hungover state, i lose my balance (actually, i am not real coordinated, i fall even not hung over) and tumble ever so gracefully into the damn duckery.  which was full of ducks.  and dirty ducky water.  it was like one giant mud puddle with tons of ducks.  needless to say, it was a very funny moment and a great picture.  and you know, i still love ducks...according to gabe, i even walk somewhat similar to a duck...which i am taking as a compliment, even though that is a questionable inference.  but hey, it's my damn blog and i can draw all sorts of inferences.    alright, back to the joys of living in a newly constructed home, which is certainly incredibly beautiful, but sometimes frustrating.  specific to this instance there were no peeking half toothed builders or random workers waking me up, but instead a broken hot water heater...so, cold showers for me.  now, i know cold showers can serve an important function, but really, i'm not in the frame of mind or physical desperation where i need to utilize such a freezing shower, but whatever, i'll roll with it, given i have absolutely NO ability to fix it given my total lack of mechanical skills.  word on the street (or around the house) is that a new one will be installed later today, amazingly when i am at work, so i won't actually have to deal with anyone fixing things for a day.  such a treat.  alright, enough from me.  i finished work last night at 1 am and am now getting ready to go back in...the whole late night shift back to back with the lunch shift kinda blows, but whatever, i need some frelling (thank you caleb) money.

       i went paddleboating last night.&nbsp; i had such fun, floating on a paddleboat, drinking beer and just relaxing.&nbsp; it was a great summer night.&nbsp; i have a new found love for paddleboats and the activities involved in such a night.     on a less fun, but slightly more productive note, i had the conversation with the 34 year old tuesday night.&nbsp; it went well, really, considering.&nbsp; we both agreed the timing was poor for us meeting and trying to date.&nbsp; neither of us was interested in the long distance concept, so that wasn't a tough decision.&nbsp; we will remain friends, probably keeping in touch via email or phone, through the school year, and maybe, in may, when i am back here possibly for good, we will see where we stand then.&nbsp; however, in the meantime, no worries about differing expectations.&nbsp; we are both on the same page now and that is good.&nbsp;   looking forward to going back to school, at least in some aspcts.&nbsp; can't believe it is my last year.&nbsp; a tad bit scary, really.&nbsp;   alright, i have all sorts of errands to do...none of which include a paddlboat, sadly.&nbsp;

       honestly, why do people not understand proper english?     &nbsp;   in my last blog, approximately one week ago, i detailed the discussion i had with the 34 year old about how things should be kept casual...that more than likely there would be no attempt at a long distance relationship in three weeks when i leave.&nbsp; i dreaded having this conversation, procrastinated as much as possible, and then finally sucked it up and got it out there....alleviating much anxiety and guilt for me.&nbsp; well, evidently the conversation lacked in something, since i got an email yesterday from the 34 year old asking me to further clarify my feelings for him and our situation.&nbsp; AGH!&nbsp; i don't want to elaborate any further.&nbsp; i actually might just want to be done with it all.&nbsp; so, one week from my last shitty relationship conversation, i am dreading the next scheduled one....which will be taking place in about six hours.&nbsp; honestly, we spend more time discussing this relationship than actually having one.&nbsp; that might be considered a problem.     &nbsp;   i'm not good at real bona fide relationships.&nbsp; boyfriend/girlfriend ones.&nbsp; for so long i have been avoiding such relationships as if they were the plague, instead opting for the always present and suprisingly convenient and fulfilling friends with benefits situation.&nbsp; well, now that i am trying to be a freakin' grown up, i have been telling myself that a boyfriend wouldn't be bad.&nbsp; and i am sure it wouldn't be a bad thing if only i could remember how such a relationship worked.&nbsp; this is a problem.&nbsp; someone needs to alert houston.     &nbsp;   totally unrelated, i know why special k cereal is so low in calories....it's because it is pretty much nothing.&nbsp; you eat a bowl of say, special k with red berries, and ten minutes later you are left wondering why you feel as if you have yet to even eat breakfast.&nbsp; it's annoying.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   i had to go to the hospital yesterday for what i thought was going to be a simple and easy routine test regarding my crappy kidneys.&nbsp; instead i was there for over two hours, with various ivs and fluids running into my body while some grossly expensive atom counter was imaging the atoms in my frelling kidneys.&nbsp; it was perhaps one of the worst experiences in my whole life.&nbsp; honestly.&nbsp; it blew.     &nbsp;   i'm babysitting a 16 year old girl for the next couple of days.&nbsp; babysitting isn't really the correct term, but i have yet to come up with a better one.&nbsp; really, her folks are out of town and she has a known propensity for getting into trouble, so i am staying there.&nbsp; as if i am going to keep her butt out of trouble.&nbsp; right....i was up until almost four am last night waiting for the acne laden teenage boys to leave the house with their 40 ouncers.&nbsp; i forgot what it was like to be 16.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   ahh, what else?&nbsp; nothing all that serious, really, aside for the pending repetitive discussion with the 34 year old.&nbsp; of course i will keep you all posted on the results of that, but i can kinda predict what will happen.&nbsp; i foresee me mumbling lots of things rather quickly (works as a confusion tactic) while saying many nice things about him and lamenting my current shortcomings in terms of relationships.&nbsp; then i will stealthily find my ben harper cd.&nbsp; once said cd is obtained, i will proceed to end the situation and go home and deal with a 16 year old.&nbsp; at least that is what i see happening.&nbsp; aside from that, i am going to try to run a half marathon sometime in september, i think.&nbsp; so know not only do i have to run to work off all the&nbsp;crap i eat&nbsp;when i have the munchies, but i also have to run to train for this.&nbsp; should be interesting.&nbsp; i am so&nbsp;going to reward myself with something from the mall if i make it all those miles.&nbsp; just so you all know.    &nbsp;   but really, when do things ever ever go as i plan?     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

       have i mentioned how there are times in my life where i don't like being an adult?&nbsp; times when i would prefer to just fall off the face of my earth and avoid the uncomfortable situation that is plagueing me.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   anyhow, obviously i have bumbled myself into such a situation.&nbsp; with the 34 year old.&nbsp; now the 34 year old is so very very nice.&nbsp; he is super kind.&nbsp; very sweet.&nbsp; considerate.&nbsp; adult.&nbsp; mature.&nbsp; adjusted.&nbsp; and really all these adjectives that are good and not bad...but you know, he is almost too nice for me.&nbsp; it is difficult for me, i prefer someone with an edge, a little bit of a sarcastic side.&nbsp; almost a bit of a mean streak, and my 34 year old certainly doesn't have this.&nbsp; honestly, when he says something, he means it.&nbsp; he isn't sarcastic, he is sincere.&nbsp; very sincere.&nbsp; i end up over thinking most everything he says, looking for a hidden meaning, and then i realize that he really is just being honest and sincere and means exactly what he said.&nbsp; nothing more and nothing less.&nbsp; and that is scary....and kinda annoying.&nbsp; it is in my nature to look for a challenge...and in return, i am challenging too, but&nbsp;he just doesn't fit this mold, and honestly, he is probably annoyed by me being hcallenging when he is being so easy.&nbsp; and according to my sources, this whole&nbsp;challenge that i am looking&nbsp;for is futile and destructive, something i am to give up, but i'm not so sure.    &nbsp;   so, i needed to have a discussion with him, because i was getting overwhelmed by all the niceness.&nbsp; the constant car door opening was throwing me totally off my game.&nbsp; the flowers i was getting was making me nervous.&nbsp; the thoughtful gestures were just confusing me.&nbsp; i felt a bit overwhelmed.&nbsp; i was scared.&nbsp; and all i wanted to do was not confront this situation and hope that it went away all by itself (i've seen others use this tactic, and i never appreciated it, so i knew i wasn't going to do this, but still, it looked like a good option for a minute).&nbsp; but i confronted it regardless of my hesitation.&nbsp; had a few beers first (they always help) and sat my 34 year old down and discussed our situation with him.&nbsp; i wanted to lessen the pressure, alleviate my concerns, because at this point, i was so anxious about the situation that i wasn't even allowing myself to have fun around him....so, i had the talk with him.&nbsp; discussed that i did really like him, and this situation had potential, but not in a long distance manner.&nbsp; the long distance thing just is really bad timing.&nbsp; so, i discussed this with him, he was awesome about it and now i feel SO very much better.&nbsp; i really do.&nbsp; we are both on the same page, with the same expectations.&nbsp; and this makes me feel so very much better.     &nbsp;   on a totally unrelated note, i worked a 16 hour shift last saturday at the bar.&nbsp; i can't even begin to imagine how many frelling beers i served that day.&nbsp; i made bank, that is for sure, but still, i hated most every minute of it.

       went to the zoo last week with my nephew, luke who is 3 1/2.&nbsp; he, of course, loved every minute of it.&nbsp; even the minute where he was spitting up a hot dog in my hand (after chewing it), and asking me to blow on it because it was obviously too hot.&nbsp; (gross)&nbsp; he also loved the camel ride we took (twice), but perhaps that is because he got the comfortable (for a camel) spot, and i got to sit directly on the hump.&nbsp; i was so freakin' tall, felt like i was towering over everyone.&nbsp; let's see...what else happened at the zoo?&nbsp; oh yeah, in the petting zoo, while i was taking a picture of luke and a pig, a goat took a bite out of my cargo pants, resulting in a hole in my pants.&nbsp; yeah, that was a treat.&nbsp; glad he didn't get my ass.&nbsp; so, we went to the zoo.&nbsp; i spent $55 on one small child.&nbsp; i need to learn to say no.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  what else?&nbsp; still dating the new adult.&nbsp; slighlty unsure of how i feel about this person and this situation.&nbsp; he is just so mature, adjusted, normal, stable and nice....it is almost too much for me.&nbsp; sounds silly, huh?&nbsp; he got me roses, it gave me anxiety.&nbsp; this might be a problem.&nbsp; i just think he might be too nice for me.&nbsp; i am not really all that nice of a person...he is.&nbsp; we'll see.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  made good money at work last night, which is always a bonus.&nbsp; maybe my car won't get repossessed.&nbsp; or maybe it will.&nbsp; either way.    &nbsp;  can a person be too nice?&nbsp; what is my problem?&nbsp; people love to get flowers...how can i not love it too?

      i had a grown up date last night.  a real one.  with an adult.  he is nine years older than me, which really, isn't outrageous.  in actuality, it is refreshing.  he is not going to call me drunk at four in the morning.  he has outgrown that.  he isn't going to throw nalgene bottles at me, drunk, given that he has outgrown that too.    but in all honesty, i had a good time last night.  a really good time.  i laughed a lot.  i liked being around him.  i wasn't uncomfortable, which is good, since i didn't really know him prior to going out.  he picked me up.  he opened vehicle doors for me.  he paid for things.  we did grown up things and it was really really fun.  i like him.  i really do.  and i am going out with him on tuesday, again.  (fun, huh?)  (i seriously was concerned about what to wear, more because my clothes do not look adult and mature a lot of the time, but it was all good.  he had no qualms about wanting me to look older than i really am, which i am a fan of.  but thanks gabe for all the thought on the outfit.)

      i dislike bad endings...not so much just in movies, but especially in my freakin' nights.  and tonight is one of those endings.  had a good start.  made money at work, got out early, went to a bachelorett party, had fun there...left to go hang out and relax with some friends...which i was doing while enjoying my snack attack fix of mcdonalds (think bad bad case of the munchies), and i get the frelling phone call that frelled it all.  yeah, it was a boy i know.  not well, but somewhat so, one i was contemplating getting to know better than i did at that point.  anyhow, he's calling, he's drunk, he needs a ride.  immediately, as if on auto pilot, i agree to get him.  as i am walking out the door, i realize that in my hazy state i agreed to do something i didn't want to do.  i didn't want to deal with him, especially with me not drunk and him severely intoxicated.  but it was too late.  i had to deal with his high drama bullshit (i had only very recently realized that this boy was so high drama, thus my reasoning on not to get to know him better than i already did).  so, i go and get his drunk ass.  and as soon as he gets in the car, he starts yelling and screaming and being absolutely irate with me about something that i cannot comprehend.  i try to discuss the situation, using my inside voice (unlike his monster voice), but the rationale just wasn't there.  when it gets to the point where i am kinda scared (scared because i don't know him well enough to know how he is when he is drunk and irrational, not because i really thought he would hurt me, but still scared and nervous nonetheless), i turn my car around and drop his ass right off where i found him.  i took the opportunity to not have to deal with him.  i took the opportunity to get myself out of a situation that wasn't going anywhere.  and you know, i feel kinda bad for getting in that spot in the first place, i should have known better, but still, i did what i had to do.  i am past the point of being able to deal with boys that i know won't work out and that aren't healthy.    lesson learned.    now where is the damn mcdonalds i left for this idiot?  i have the munchies.  honestly.

      these hours are killing me.  what's worse is that they are my own fault.  i choose to work at this bar, knowing that the hours would be rough.  furthermore, i choose to go out after work, staying up later than six or seven in the morning multiple days on end, catching naps in the afternoon to compensate for lost sleep at night.  and i have had fun, i really have.  but now i am exhausted and perhaps getting a bit sick...not a really big shocker, but still a sad occurrence.  went to the doctor yesterday for a brief check up...and was super excited about the significant drop in my blood pressure, which is   almost   back to the normal range.  in addition i have dropped some more weight, perhaps due to the obsessive running...so i am now six pounds lighter than a month ago.  hurray for that.  and the loss of six pounds is helpful, considering that friday night at work we had a budweiser promotion in the bar, which somehow necessitated wearing the tiniest shirts ever.  (clearly, this was helpful to bring in larger tips, but seriously, felt overexposed, which is saying a lot for me.)  anyhow, all i could think about was how i looked like i had mugged an eight year old for her tiny tshirt.  i also got to wait on the owner of the bar that i work at and his buddies, who drank for several (think like ten) hours.  they were absolutely wasted and slightly obnoxious (especially with the child sized shirts), but you know, they tipped really well, so...i'll get over staying three extra hours after the normal closing time of 2am.  oh yeah, i served them until five in the morning.  it was quite a treat...whatever though, i brought in over $300 in tips that night, which means rent is covered.    what else?  i have a date in a week that should be interesting.  a guy (note that i say guy...normally i would say boy, but he is clearly a guy, given that i think he is about 10 years older than me) that i meant at work (he doesn't work there, just hangs out after golf) who has asked me out.  he seems super nice, normal and actually very funny (always important to me), so what the hell, i'll give it a go.  so, i'll keep us all posted on that and how that works out.  what else?  heading up north to traverse city in a day or so for a nice break.  planning on only laying in the sun, playing on the beach and drinking beer the entire time.  screw eating food, it is a beer diet for me for those three days.  in preparation for the traverse trip, i needed to go swim suit shopping, but the only available time was when i was babysitting my 10 year old cousin, who needless to say was not thrilled with the prospect of waiting for me to evaluate which suit looked the best.  we negotiated it out, he waited, i and i then spent the next TWO hours in the freakin' arcade, reading the paper and holding the 2,568 tickets he won off from the $40 he squandered away.  right, he's not spoiled or anything...  that's about it really.  i am exhausted (damn bar owner), getting a bit sick, but not dying from high blood pressure or obesity and i have a pending date that may or may not see me in my new swim suits that cost me two hours of my life in an arcarde.

       pretty much two weeks left here in michigan...then i am off again, driving miles and miles and miles again back to school. in preparation, i have not managed to save any money this summer. yeah, saving money is just not my strong suit...i'm better at not saving it. anyhow, i did just get my tires rotated on the saturn...additionally i got new windshield wipers. that should totally ensure that the saturn makes it to school and doesn't break down in south dakota. rrriiigghhhttt. so, yeah, i'm going to have to get on the ball and get shit done. the saturn needs some love otherwise i totally believe it will abandon me and leave me stranded in the barren land of south dakota.    what else? done with the far too adult 32 year old. i don't even think we are on speaking terms anymore. he pulled a little shit and acted kinda stupid, i blew it out of proportion in an effort to ensure the end and he called me out on my manipulation and now i am just done. i hate being called out on things. so, whatever, it is done. it isn't done well, but it is done. any relationships/friendships i have developed this summer are just doomed, given my pending move back to school. i half jokingly said that i should have come with a warning label this summer, stating that i am only here to have fun for the summer months, and that after that i would be moving on...  took the three year old nephew to the beach yesterday. it was a fantastic day and luke was full of excitement at the prospect of the biggest sandbox he had ever seen in his life. we built sand castles, went swimming, ate lunch (of course he managed to spit chewed up french fries all over my face...he never fails to do something kinda gross), and i got hit on a couple of times by what i can only assume are single dads...or uncles using their small nieces or nephews to pick up chicks. tough call. either way, i didn't find true love on the beach with my nephew. i did have a fantastic time though...i am really really going to miss that little guy. he is just so damn adorable and really, i do believe him when he tells me that he loves me. others make me wonder, but not him. he's too precious to be dishonest at this point.  gabe came up sunday, as is our ritual for the summer. it was good times, as is the ritual as well. ate some dinner, didn't go to a prince concert...but did drink some beer out on the patio of the bar i used to work at downtown while people watching. i am also going to miss seeing gabe with such regularity...i didn't see him at all for so long and now i have seen him almost weekly this summer. you know, it is actually nice to be able to physically see your best friend. going back to school will be sad because of gabe too. i'll be frelling up our sunday tradition this sunday, since i am going to the badlands of indiana with some fun folks i met this summer...they are big into jeeping (whatever that is) and i think i just need to have some fun. so, i'll have to head down to st. joe later in the week...  going with a new hair color in a week. am currently taking votes on whether i should remain dark (probably even going darker) or go back to my blonder days. so, feel free to vote...i may or may not follow such votes.  alright folks....ashlee simpson reruns are on and i need to catch up. such is the life of me.
