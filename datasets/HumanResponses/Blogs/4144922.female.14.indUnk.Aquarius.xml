      today was the big day. the performance. and, of course, the AGM. which, in case you dont already know, i've been dreading. it was the day that mixed me up. feelings of joy, despair and the oddest sensation of trying to hold back tears and cry with joy at the same time. i do not have the emotional range of a teaspoon, alright? i just feel mixed up. i'm upset abt kat leaving, but i'm also glad that i'm stil part of the committe and that staff and master trust me enough to give me such a position. i will do my best. i wont let the system down. everything is new. i hope we get a smooth start. this new post has lots more responsibilities, but i look forward to the challenge. i wanna work well with my new senior although we probably have different views on things. i really wanna make the best of my time in the band. coz i really love it a lot. today's performance totally rocked. i meant ROCKED, kie? it was awesome! the NCC were great too, but i think we were better. but then again, who am i to judge..? i'm just biased coz i belong to the band. but, kor, NCC was awesome! congrats to the cadets! i hope everyone enjoyed watching as much as i enjoyed performing. tmr got 1 more performance! the last one. must jia you wor, everybody! i will miss all my darling seniors de. it just wont be the same without you guys. we will jia you for the SYF de. dont worry abt us. we wont let you down. you guys must study hard and do well. dont let us down. we love you! all the best, guys.. chel

      i wish i could turn back the time. stop time. i'll do just abt anything to go back to the past. the past is a shadow. a shadow that will follow you. where ever you go. whatever you do. i really should learn to avoid doing things i'll regret. its totally taxing emotionally. i guess i'm guilty of not practicing what i preach. haha. but, its only human. its only me. i want to go back. to go back to the times that were filled with joy and smiles. but, it wont happen. i know. i know. everyone tells me the same thing. its too late. i took it for granted when i had it. now i cant turn back. i havent made you smile enough. i havent heard you laugh enough. its just not enough. haiz.. time flies. too fast. too too fast. i'll miss you. we all will. i hope i havent let you down. i'm sorry if i've every made you worry. i'm sorry if i ever hurt you. i dont know if i could ever pay you back for all that you've done for me. thanks. alot. for everything.  chel
