      NOOOOO!!! Jeff JUST walked in the back door and i didn't have time to get away, which means, i'm stuck here to talk to him! Damn the luck. Talking about getting away, anyone want to go somewhere with me? It HAS to be out of town and it HAS to be within the next few days. Oh, and another requirement (just a small one...) they must have a car. Problem? I want to go skydiving sometime soon too. So far, this summer, I want to have to have my picture taken, go on scavenger's hunt (long story), buy body paint, get drunk with some people and draw all over each other (so hot), go skydiving, find someone that I find  completely  sexually attracting and just rape them, go on a shopping spree and completely dazzle myself up for a   huge  party. The last few days have been kind of messed up.A few days ago, I got drunk and that night and the day after both sucked, then I get drunk again and that night and the day after are both amazing. I had so much fun, minus the fact that my nose ifs fractured, and I realized how much I love to hear people talk. But then again, I was stalked two times yesterday, once with Hannah and once with Megan. It was pretty creepy. It's too long for me to actually put what happened in here because I don't realy feel like being on here. GUYS! I want one but they all suck so much. I want one that I can actually connect with AND find sexually attracting. But no one who I can really connect with is attractive to me, and no one I know is sexually attractive to me anyway. Another problem is every guy who I think of as even remotely attractive has this thing for Jenny or Hannah or every other girl but me. Am I destined to live the next 4 years without anyone? Fuck, this sucks.

      As some people know, I tried out for this movie thing... and what even fewer people know is that I actually got a part. yay.  Getting it also restricted me. While my brother and sister and a friend of my sister’s are up in Minnesota, visiting MY relatives, I’m here, with my mom. I’ve only been alone with her for about 5 hours, yet already I can see where the next four days are gonna be… hell. Another thing, I really like the band Live. It’s a good band. Listen to it. I’ve been having so many emotional breakdowns and finally, when everyone leaves, I get over them. Typical. I need someone to call me and do something. Something new, that I haven’t done. I have to house for about three or four days. All to myself…. That’s depressing. I shouldn’t have it all to myself. That means I have mom all to myself. And we don’t mix. Don’t get me wrong, I love my mom. I love her more than so many people in the world. I love her for everything. When I yell at her, I feel the worst guilt in the world. I wish I could help her, make her understand life. Make her see everything, comprehend everything, know everything… but I don’t have to patience and she doesn’t ask, she yells. So I yell. Then we both yell. Then I storm out, she runs off to find me, and buys me food. All better. We go home, she doesn’t let me leave, I ask “why?” and instead of answering me she yells. Then I yell, then we both yell. Get it? Unless you’re like her, you should. I want to be out of the house. It’s suck a beautiful day outside and I’m sitting inside on the god damn computer. That’s what mornings are for, not afternoons. I think I’ll go find something to eat and possibly use the phone to call someone. Cell phones… I want one.

      Life…  when first a child sees the bright lights of the real world, the reality beyond the wildest dreams of any living creature, it does not know what to ever expect. To grow, so fast over so many years, yet to be so completely unaware of the tramas that life throws at us…. The pains that life has in store for our future.    As kids we take freedom and the right to run around and just have fun as a part of the play time games… we can be so creative. Talking to shadows on the walls, day dreaming about a daring escapes from a dragon’s den, building castle’s and houses out of couch cushin's and dining room chairs, trying to dress up cats like our dolls…… our childhood  passes by so fast and we were able to grab to little memories and keep sakes. My childhood flashes before my eyes and all I can say for it is that I can look back and smile…     Growing up… the years pass by like minutes. Days pass by like seconds. Before we know it, we begin to realize that life is short and we only have so long to live. Money becomes our world…. Buying clothes, doing hair, looking “beautiful”, being yourself… more confusing then our childhood. We struggle to figure out who we really are and what we are really like inside…. Trying to fit in and make friends. Experiencing new things, new styles, making friends, having fun, and trying stuff. We try to make time go as slow as we can, trying to stay young and beautiful , yet yearning to be older and to be free.     As we get older, life starts to speed up on us and we start to slow down. We try to make time to have fun and to spend time with the family, friends, pursue our long lost dreams… to make the most of the rest of our lives. We look back at the last 70 years of living and try to figure out how 70 years got itself to seem as short as taking a walk through a park on the bright sunny day, back when you were 5 years old. To you, the trees still look the same, wonderfully green and comforting. The water still is blue and clear enough to see yourself in. But now, when you look at your reflection, you don’t just see a young child running around, you see that the life has splash by, as swift and sure as the waves made by the winds changing the way the water flows. The wind blows the reflection quite a bit, making it hard to see the future and past. All that you can focus on is the present. The life all around. Soon you won’t be able to look at yourself and wonder why you didn’t do what you wanted to do…why you didn’t try to save hours in little frames, days in tapes, memories in journals and diaries. All you have left of your life is the emptiness inside your heart where originally dreams and the tears of hope had filled it so. Now, looking ahead, you only see darkness. Reaching up trying to find a light, you only grab a hand of a young child. You look into their eyes and smile.    Life goes on, but you get left behind, hopefully to return with a 2nd chance at perfecting life…

      Life is hard. No doubt about that. And it sucks too. Now that we have the no-brainers out of the way, I’ll start with me. I can’t seem to face anything in life with an open view right now. Which is completely not me. I normally sit and think about everything. How others feel, how I do and should feel; but now.... I’m changing, but the results aren’t good ones. At least, in my eyes, they’re not. But I just can’t help it. I’m becoming more secluded every day. I keep realizing how stupid some people are, and how others really just pretend that they like me, just to not hurt me. I can’t stop thinking about 5 of them. It hurt so much when I finally realized that they don’t really like me. I don’t even think they realize that they don’t. It’s just one of the hardest facts of life. No one wants to realize that someone they love can be someone that they hate and want to never see. I am guilty of that too. As ashamed as I am to say so. I love so many people, especially one in particular. I want to see that person so bad, just I can’t call, I can’t do anything about it. I’m too afraid. Fears. Another shit bargain in life. Fuck. It sucks. I never really thought that I would be typing my thoughts to a computer. I feel so small. Twenty. That’s something that has been pestering me for a LONG time. That’s the age when I’m supposedly going to fall deeply in love... to stay. I want so desperately to find someone now. Just to love. I don’t care if that person isn’t going to be here my entire life. I just want Mr. Love Me Now to waltz into a room with me, see me, and know right off that I’m sitting there just for him. I know, all girls want the same thing; Love, beauty, money, and passion. I want more. I want deeper. I want to just look at someone and want to tackle them. To just fall on them and know that I have a kiss waiting for me. SNAP back to life. It sucks. I want to go to a “capture the flag” thing that’s going on, but I don’t think that anyone wants me there. I know that people don’t want me there. No one ever wants me. Just my brother and sister. They really matter. Not me. I just tag along like some little pest who won’t go away. I want to go soo bad. I feel so left out. But I can’t go. No one wants me. That sucks. Plus, my grandma might die. Stroke and 3 brain aneurisms. She might die if she goes into surgery but might not live if she doesn’t. Wow, another punch. Life really sucks. Plus, all my friends are out of town, and the ones left, haha, this is funny..... don’t like me!!! WOW!!! shocker isn’t it? Well, it’s not that they don’t like me, it’s, as I said before, that they just can’t stand me. At least the ones at the C.t.f. thing I wanted to go to. Then there’s megan. I believe she just doesn’t care. I love her, just she doesn’t care. Ha! Lets repeat.... Life sucks. Really. I’m so close to just letting go. Letting go of life. It’s that time of life when I just feel like swimming in a wonderful tub of water, only when I go under, I stay under. Suicide. It’s a wonder. GOD I wish that just once someone, instead of someone fucking calling my sister of brother to “hang out” and “watch a movie” they could at least ask me to hang with them too. FUCK EVERYONE. Fuck everyone.

      Sometimes, things just catch you so off guard that you have no choice but to retaliate into a dark corner of your life and hibernate. That’s how everything is making me feel. Anything new that I learn or think about just makes me want to run and start a completely new life. But then again, (stopped)  5-13-04    This week has been undoubtably the strangest and most surprising week I’ve been through in a while. I’ve went skinny dipping this week and I loved it. I’m so depressed but all that I really want to do is sit and watch the beauty and wonder of everything. Stefan, wow, this is confusing. I finally talked to him, and told him everything. Everything about my family, thoughts, fears, friends; I just couldn’t seem to stop talking. He told me that he cared about me and I was one of the few people who he actually listened to and cared what I thought about him and life. But the problem is, I’m not sure if I feel the same. I like him a lot, and I wish I could feel the same, but it just won’t happen. He’s awesome. I love him to death, he’s one of the few people I can actually open up to and really get into a deep conversation. But then again, I’m not attracted to him. Not as I should be. Not as I want to be. I have a fear of relationships. I fear that if I don’t like them like I should or have before to someone else, then I’ll only end up hurting them. It’s happened before. I’ve done it to so many people, whom I don’t even know, yet they just confess to me and tell me how I broke their hearts. I can’t do that to Stefan too. He’s too good of a companion. Family; I’m trying to get along with my mom. I’m desperately trying. But the more I try to bond with her or cope with her, she just expects more and more of me. I can’t keep on going like this. I try so hard not to blow up but she makes it impossible. Then there’s friends, I need to hang out with new people. I need time away from Rani, Megan, Olivia and everyone I hang out with all the time. I feel like I’m taking them for granted and that I’m just using them now. I couldn’t live with myself if I really start to do that. But I am, so that’s why I need to hang out with new people, just so I can become me again. Everything is just so confusing. I want to meet just one person, who I can find sexually appealing and an equal. I don’t know what qualities I want. I cannot say. I will know when I meet him. Hopefully a him. Haha I’m kinda screwed if it’s a her. That raises something else. I’m not a lesbian, I’m not bisexual, I’m nothing of the sort. I just don’t give a rats ass about kissing. Unless it’s passionate and meaningful, then I think of it as only practice, I guess. I don’t think of it at all. I have to leave. I’ll try to come back and write again, although, whenever I start something like a journal, I never seem to keep it going.

      I'm in minnesota dying... god save me. I have to go to my grandma's house where I get to spend three grouling days packing and carrying every single thing in the entire house to a U-haul truck with the wicked witch herself, Grandma Florance. Three days...... I won't survive. Maybe if I had someone to help me and someone to be with when I'm about to break down, but not alone. She saw my hair and starting telling me how aweful it was. Then we went grocery shopping and she saw some friends and introduced me like this... "Have you met my grand daughter? This is Astred. She used to be te most gorgeous blonde but now she's just a boring redhead. Funny how stupid some teenagers can be, right? Haha... (when she says something mean and really means it, she tends to laugh to make it not sound AS mean as she really meant it to be. Grandma style.) Then we went home where I spent 5 nonstop hours weeding, packing, and carrying 50 lb boxes up a steep flight of stairs  only to find her waiting for me so she can complain about how she's so alone and no one ever goes to help her...... then she gives me a huge list of everything that needed to be done. If someone reads this, don't tell my mom. She already called Roger and told him a bunch of things that I told her in secrecy. God...... damn....... it...... Someone please write to me. The only salvation I have is checking my email to find that two people have written to me in the last couple days! Yay!! Then I call some people and try to talk to them, when one of them talks nonstop then has to suddenly go..... (end of that) and the other two I call and it's a bad time so they both hang up. Ten dollars for a fucking phone card that only has 120 minutes on it just to waste almost a half an hour being blown off. Wow. And to think yesterday was such a good day... during the day. Plus, I've been having nightmares. Not ust kid ones.... intense ones. Ones that scare the shit out of you. Ones that still play in my head when I'm awake. I stayed awake until two one morning crying because the dream was so horrible and I refused to fall back to sleep again. This house creeps me out when I'm alone somewhere in it. And I'm alone here. Not even Roger is home.  The only person I've been talking to is Dan Manciu from Canada, so please..... write to me. I miss everyone so much and yet, when I'm here crying because I have no one but my dreams, everyone back home is having fun or at least in the shelter of their own houses. I'm just sitting waiting to be taken away to a prison forced into slavery to which the only reward is to go shopping in stores and have clothes bought for me that I don't even like. To be humiliated because The Witch wants  us to wear similar clothes. "It's grandma/grand gaughter day! We can look alike!" Why do I feel so deserted? At least if someone was here that I could talk to.... All I have right now is the dark, shadowy walls and corners, a guy I've never even met, a computer and my dreams, which in turn, will be against me too.

      If I spelled masquito wrong, live with it. It's my blog, it's my spelling.  I drove from 7 in the morning, all day, all night (with a few excetions to the stops we made which were few and only one lasted an hour) into the next morning and FINALLY arrived at the Grand Tetons at about 3-ish the next day. It was horrible. I couldn't sleep well and I couldn't drive and so I had to sit in the front seat with my grandpa telling him to slow down and wait for the car my sister was driving. But, I have to admit, the Tetons were great. I was getting so lazy and suddenly, I was out in the wild, hiking and walking constantly. I did one hike that was about 7. 6 miles to the place, Lake Solitude (it was so gorgeous. The water was such a brilliant color of turquois and there was snow on the banks and I sat on this gigntic rock that took me about 4 minutes to walk across and sat on a ledge perched over the water.) and 9.2 miles back and it was all either rocks, uphill, downhill, forests or bug paradises. So much for being lazy. The next day, on my own free will, I worked out for about two and a half hours. I'm really starting to like the way I look. I didn't wear make-up besides this lip gloss/chapstick thing and I was perfectally content. And, I'm getting smaller. I'm finally loosing my winter weight. But, I keep having these dreams.... Not full on sleep dreams, but strange out of the blue days dreams. I'll just be sitting somewhere and just fall to the side and have a dream. Each one is different, but strangely familiar. The last one was about two hours ago. Oh, I am now in minnesota. We, as in Uncle Mikkel, Grandpa Roger and Per Idunnohislastname. drove all night only to stop twice (McDonalds and Pizza Hut/Gas station) and arrved here in Minnesota at 9 this morning. I wish I could call someone. I desperately need to talk to someone. I'm in a room all alone on the Frist floor and it's such a dark and cramped room. I brought my stuff in and made it a little better, but still.... and I'm hungry damnit. It's only 11:49, yet i'm about to go ransack the entire kitchen and eat everything and everyone in the veiw. O bugger. ANOTHER THING! being around family makes you talk better.... in a sense that now,  when I fall or do something stupid or that hurts, instead of saying "shit" or "fuck" or "bloody hell", I say "whoopsies" or "dangit" or "crrrrap". By the time I come back, I'll be a good little girl. Watch out, or else I might tattle on you to mommy.

      Megan thinks I stole from her. She thinks I stole two make-up powder things and ten dollars. I would never steal from her. I lost her trust and did nothing that desrves me losing it. And the worst of it is, I did nothing so there's nothing I can say to get it back again. I wish I could tell her I took them, just so she'd feel better, but I won't lie and I refuse to accuse myself of something I didn't do. I'm hurt. If I were her, I might think the same thing, but I'd give myself more trust then she is giving. Just because I've stolen things in my life doesn't mean I steal from friends. I wouldn't ever do that. I have too much love and respect to do that. There were two other people staying the night there that night, and all I did was stick a fucking skirt and belt into her purse and left.   I LEFT AND TOOK NOTHING OF HERS WITH ME  . Why didn't she accuse one of the other two people that were there of taking her money? No, because I'M the bad person... I wish she could know how much this means to me. How much it crushed me inside to know that she doesn't believe me. The clues point to me, and I  do  admit that even I was thinking about how it looked like I did it, but I didn't. I didn't. I'm leaving for the Grand Tetons in a couple days. And I just found out yesterday. Another big  punch  in the face is that I have to go and spend a whole week alone with my Grandpa Roger and Unle Mikkle. And&nbsp;what I really want to do is see Kendle... and&nbsp;Zoey&nbsp;and Rani&nbsp;and Jenny and someone who cares. Anyone who cares. Anyone who trusts me.

      I hate the way I love you,  The way I feel at ease.  I hate the way my heart lifts up and flows along the breeze.  I hate the way&nbsp;you hold me.  It gets me every time.  And when I have a speech planned out I forget every line.  I hate the way your eyes shine,  I hate the way you smile.  I hate the fact that nothing else, but you, is worth my while.  I hate the painful silence,  Now that you are not around.  I hate the way you loved  me  before I tossed  us  to the ground.

      I have been&nbsp; acting like a COMPLETE moron today. In fact, I can't act like  me &nbsp; around the "movie crowd". So, now I'm&nbsp;stuck in a hallway sitting on the stairs all by myself. Such a life to live! I wish I had my camera with me right now. When the sun shines in through the door, the bricks light up and glow gold. It's unbelievably gorgeous for such plain things. I'm so confused. I'm about to cry, yet about to laugh. Why is it that I'm so nervous around these people? They look at me and I can feel that they're trying to judge or figure me out. I wish they were comfortable enough around me so they wouldn't feel the need to do that. Kendle... wow. Something about him just attracts me. I think I see him looking at me, but maybe I'm just imagining things. God, why am I so facinated by him? Well, he's gone now until the 14th of august...?&nbsp; I wanted to talk to him so badly, but fear blocked me. Why am I so afraid? When I see him, I just want to hug him&nbsp;or jump on him, which hardly ever happens. The last time it truely happened was with Rosko... I wish I would've told Kendel this stuff before he left. I'm so stupid. And alone. Why, even though I have so many wonderful people in my life, do I feel so alone? Why doesn't anyone come out and get me? No one wants me, I'm afraid to say. I will, for now, be alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -written in the High School hallway while filming Rowan and Julia

      I went to film for the movie I'm in today at 3 O'clock, and left the house on a journey to Megan's at about 7:30. I spent the whole time in someone's hot, humid, and mucky house shooting the same scene over and over and over and over... but, it was a blast. Minus the fact that I had to make out with this guy about 50 fucking times. And even when we didn't have to, HE STILL DID! So finally, I took a chip over with me, because we weren't supposed to be making out, and when I went over and he went it, I put the chip in my face, took a bite and stared at him. Then, he tried to take the chip away and kiss me!! What a prick! And I just kept taking bites until he's like ".... aaaand cut!". After that, I think he got the point. But it was still awesome!!! We're filming tomarrow, too, at the high school. It'll be so hot in there. No air conditioning, and in costumes. Fuck. Fun. Fucking Fun. Jenny, Gemma, Nandi and Quinn left today. I really insainly hope that Jenny comes back. If she doesn't, I don't knwo what I'll do. I lurv her like I love all of my close friends. L, D, E, T, M and K, but to me, mainly: L, M and K. I'm sick and I can't talk without sounding like COMPLETE shit. It's fun. Yay. Today is good.

      On tuesday, we started filming the film I'm in. We had this huge paint fight scene and I had to redo scenes over and over, yet I was all covered in paint and kept having to change to clothes identical, but weren't drenched. I've always wanted to be in a paint fight and vuala! Perfect. That night, Jenny had a party at Morningstar Studios. It was really awesome. I actually opened up while I danced. That hardly ever happens anymore. I was so relaxed. But after about an hour and a half, my voice left. Then my nose ran. And now, I'm sick. Wow! AND I'm in a movie, so Jenny Lee (co-director) is going to KILL ME! And, to make matters more comfusing, my Jenny is leaving me. I've been crying for two and a half hours. I wouldn't be so upset, except I don't know if she is leaving me forever. I couldn't stand not having her. With her, I feel as if I can really talk, and with everyone else, I feel as if they don't care. I feel like erasing life. Erasing memories which hold such anguish, such desire, such hate. To be forgotten, but to never be let go. I have to let go. I have to let anyone who has to leave my life leave it. I have to let anyone who wants to enter, enter it. I have to be able to be open. I have to believe.

      Today has been working out for me. I've watched the movie What Dreams May Come about 5 times. It's such a good movie. I'm getting happier. I'm actually in a mood to meet tons of new people and go swimming. I want to go swimming. If anyone reads this, wanna come? I spent the night at Jenny's home last night and, as you can read from my last blog, I wasn't having fun. Until, that is, I talked to Jenny when I was going to sleep. One thing that I don't like too much is when I'm trying to bare my soul and tell my problems and all someone can do is tell me how awesome I am. I'm telling them stuff, not giving my death warrant. But even when they do that, I love them. Come and feel the love while it's still here! Only $49.99 with a mail in rebate of $5.99. Shipping and handling not included...

      I'm here at Jenny's home and it's horrible. It would be fun if I'd actually imput into the conversation, just I'm not appreciating anyone right now. They're all pissing me off. Insainly. And I can't help it either. I feel so bad, but it's not helping when I try not to. I am just looking at them and realizing that none of them want me here. And that's the part that really sucks. I am not wanted. I never am. I went to this dancing party at Morningstar Studios tonight and it made my insecurities skyrocket. I wanted to stay at home tonight and mope, but that didn't happen thanks to Rani and Kristy. I'm in such a bad mood. I just want someone to care. But NO ONE DOES. NO one's there for me. Rosko... god I wish we could talk. I miss him so bad. I want to see him. But I don't think I can. I'm such a stupid bitch for dumping him. I've cried so many times. The normal thing... you get afraid and don't realize what you have, so you get rid of it, only to kill yourself over it later. Why am I so depressed? Why did whoever made me make me so unattractive? Why am I still here when I know I shouldn't be? Why am I still alive? I can't take it! I have so much love inside of me, but no one cares! I know that if I could even   connect   with someone, I know I'd be so much happier that someone even cared enough to talk to me. I could go and try to talk to talon, quinn and jenny, but when I do, they judge me and become quite. I'm better off here, on my own.

      I think I i'm depressed. I can act all giggly and hyper, but deep inside I know that all I want to do is cry. Cry for everything. I used to love myself. I used to think that I was great, I was pretty, and I had something. I was so sure of myself. I loved me, and because I loved me, I loved everyone else that much more... but now, I feel as if I'm shrinking. As if my ass gets bigger, my face gets uglier, my personality, duller. I feel as if my entire being has been burnt badly and nothing can ever make it as it was before the fire. I used to be able to talk to people, now, I just like to sit and watch. I can't seem to open my mouth and say the things I want to say. They have to either be said in my head, on paper, or not at all. I just feel like the world, which I used to love and thought loved me back, has turned on me, and now hates me or feels like I'm not good enough. I don't care if I'm good enough, just being alone scares me. I want someone to walk in and love me. Everyone does. I'm young, I know, but that doesn't mean I'm not capable of loving like someone twice my age. I need someone to hold me, kiss me, be there for me. But no one is.

      Instead of going into all the bad things, I'm going into the good. Bad takes too long to type. Good is nice and simple. So I finally have a friends here. Only three, but  I actually have some!! haha. Funny how they're all guys.... Mikkel and Per came back today. It's not so lonely. I'm comming back on Friday. But I wanted to stay and hang out with Tate. Oh well.... I'm coming home to hang with everyone else. Florance wants me to go back to her today. I don't want to, but it's money. I already earned $100 and I could earn another $50 today if I work and don't let her bother me too much. I got new clothes. Three new shoes, pair of pants, white button up shirt, two tanks, two 2/3 sleeve shirts, sweater poncho, a long sleeve shirt, and a skirt. Wow, looks like alot when you write it down. O mi god... it was SO unbelievably annoying! Last night when I went into my room, there as a misquitoand he'd disappear UNTIL I was ALMOST asleep, then he'd decide, "O she's almost sleep! How about I thrust myself into her ear?! It'll be fun!!" and PLUMP!.... right into my god damn ear. Seven times he did that. Seven times I was woken up because some ass of a misquito decided that my ear was a fun place to be... but only when I was too sleepy to kill him. But I got him.  Too bad that pillow's red now.... :S   Uffda. O boy... I have a minnesotan accent. When I say say anything with an O in it, it come out nO with the very destict OO sound. and when i say yeah it comes out yaaaa. Listen to it the next time I talk to someone. It's hilarious. Can someone tell me something? How can a doll tap on a trampoline if the tapestries the table wore is torn? She says the table tapestries are torn because of tapeing to her self and tapping on the tricky trampoline.  I'm not a figger plucker of a figger plucker's son but i can figeting pick figers unil the figger plucker comes. Until the figger comes..... c ya
