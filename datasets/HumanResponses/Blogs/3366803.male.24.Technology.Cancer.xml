      I live in a relatively civilised country. Basic services like water, power, sewage are all taken for granted. So why the fuck did I just spend an hour and a half waiting for the clowns at the electricity company to get their shit together and fix my power? The occasional blackout I can understand, but this wasn't any ordinary blackout. There was power, but at substantially fewer volts than advertised.  This may sound better than a normal blackout, after all, the lights still lit up - albeit slightly dimmer than they usually do. But there was a downside. On the way to low volts, it appears we went through a brief period of high volts. I really don't appreciate having a perfectly functional server converted into a pile of crap that refuses to boot unless you wave a dead chicken over the ATA controller before the BIOS gives up on detecting the broken drive. Particularly when said server is the critical component without which my network collapses in on itself. Oh, it also holds 5-ish years of email archives. And it handles connecting to the net. And my ISP wouldn't respond to phone calls trying to get the details I needed to set up another box to connect instead.  It's a bad sign when it takes less effort to first figure out why a hard drive that was perfectly fine 2 hours ago is not being detected anymore and  then  to come up with a temporary way around the problem than it does to get in touch with anyone who's even vaguely useful at your ISP.  Oh well, maybe I'll get a replacement for the drive at least out of the electricity company's insurance and claims department. I doubt it, but maybe.

      The Old World is scared stupid of  NBC  (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical). Some of the brighter Old World analysts have started adding an  I  for Informational.  Meanwhile, the New World has its own acronym starring those same four letters.  NBIC : Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Information Technology, Cognitive Science. I wonder how many people will still be struggling for control of the bombs, bugs, and poisons when the world shifts under them? I wonder how long it'll then take for them to realise that it has?

      It's hard to be there for someone who's desperately fucked up, when you're desperately fucked up yourself. You see the issues they have, the strange and painful behaviour those issues cause, and you understand it, cause similar shit goes on in your life. Sometimes it drives you insane. But you can't get too upset about anything they do or say, cause you know your own issues lead you to do and say things that must be at least as maddening to them.  I have... had... I don't know... a friend like that. Sometimes more than a friend. At the moment, we're barely talking. I don't know if things between us are going to get better, worse, or just fade away completely.  Maybe it'd be better if it did just fade away, for her at least.  Or maybe that'd just lead to her taking even more codeine and ending up dead from overdose.  As for me? I have no idea.

      So I've joined the teaming masses of blogging pseudo-publishers.  I have no idea what'll end up on here.  For now, a little about myself:   Hi, I'm not telling you who I am, or where I'm from.  For money, I do IT stuff, programming, sysadministration, whatever. Well, I would if I could find work. So instead I play with my computers, smoke weed, and try to avoid a complete mental breakdown. This would be easier if my financial situation weren't growing progressively more desperate as I continue to fail to find work.  I haven't killed myself yet, but I make no promises.  I don't drink often, I've never liked the taste of alcohol, and I have more fun when I'm stoned than when I'm drunk.  I am a social cripple.  I am male, and heterosexual, but open minded. Maybe sometime I'll tell you about my (pre-op) transexual girlfriend. Now that was one hell of a circus.  I never get laid.  I seem to be pretty smart. People have told me I am all my life, and I tend to get scores in the 150s on IQ tests. If so, I'm living proof that you need more than brains to do well in this world.  I like psychedelics, but find them challenging to deal with, given my rather poor mental health.  I am lonely.  I am deeply cynical, and the people who hold power in society at the moment scare me. Of course, they're no worse than the people who preceeded them. No better, but no worse.  Then again, their predecessors caused the current mess in the first place, so what hope is there that more of the same sort of people are going to clean it up rather than just making it still worse?  If you think I'm talking about the Middle East, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the collapsing education system, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the rolling calamity that is US intellectual property law, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the life destroying absurdity of the War On (Some) Drugs, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about Microsoft's dominance of the IT industry, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the horror of Reality TV, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the idiocy of billions of people refusing to use contraception because a senile virgin told them his invisible friend would be angry, you're right.  If you think I'm talking about the moronic legacy of repression and guilt the Puritans cursed the world with, you're right.  In fact, if you think I'm talking about something else entirely, you may well be right too. There's a lot of fucked up shit out there, and in the end, it's all caused by the same thing.  If you think I'm about to start ranting, you're right.   Stupid Monkey Politics.   Male baboons display their teeth, scream, and shake trees to display their power and intimidate rivals. Male humans don't usually shake trees.  We have weapons capable of rendering the globe uninhabitable. Computers that can simulate the weather. Once, we managed to put a few hairless apes on the moon, and even brought them back afterwards. Yet somehow we still follow the commands of the most ignorant, arrogant, asshole we can find. I'm amazed we've survived as long as we have, even though our world destroying technologies are explicitly weapons, and are relatively hard to get access to.  Give it 20 years and we'll see some real tests though, serious biotechnology, molecular nanotechnology, hard AI. Remember Clark's 3rd Law. Sufficiently Advanced Technology is coming. If power is still assigned in the same ancient ways - screaming and displaying teeth - when any one of these technologies become available, then we can kiss it all goodbye. We're already in the middle of the 6th mass extinction event to occur in the entire 4 billion year history of the planet, give George Bush an assembler and I'd bet a lot that he would make the Great Dying (250 million years ago, 90% of the worlds species went extinct, probably due to a major asteroid impact) look like a mild cold. Or far worse, give him the key to real AI. He might even be stupid enough to think he could contain or control it. I suspect this illusion wouldn't last long, but it wouldn't have to.  Of course, given that we're too stupid to stop killing each other over who gets to live on one particular patch of 'holy' land, much less stop breeding like plague rats despite the rather blatant evidence that we have too many people already, what hope have we of any kind of rational, civilised approach to, well, anything really? What's worse is that the insanity holds even if not all the monkeys are insane. A sane monkey must be incredibly cautious about assuming another monkey is also sane, as mistaking a smooth talking lunatic for someone rational is practically a guarantee that the sane monkey will get screwed. So instead, we must assume everyone we meet to be mad until proven sane, and the screaching monkey hordes continue their insanity.   The Liberals are wrong. The Conservatives are just as wrong. The Libertarians come closer, but their Ayn Rand obsession is worrying. In theory, capitalism is a beautiful thing. In theory, communism is even more so. Neither one works too well in the real world. I would suggest a revolution, but they have this history of being hijacked by assholes who're solely interested in power and making the overall situation even worse. So instead, let's all pretend this shit doesn't exist, crank the music, and partake of our own individual drug(s) of choice. Hey, maybe if I get fucked up enough I'll overcome my crippling self-conciousness long enough to let go and dance.

      If that doesn't arouse your sense of wonder (you do remember your sense of wonder, don't you?) then you  really  need to do something to break out of the rut you're in.  Get away from people. Make beautiful music. Go skydiving. Meditate. Drop acid. Learn quantum physics. It really doesn't matter what, just do  something  before your mind fossilises completely.

      So I had an interview yesterday, it seemed to go well. The interviewers made appreciative noises, said 'good answer', all that stuff. Then they called me this morning to tell me they're giving the job to someone else.  Why am I not surprised?  You'd really think that after all these years I'd have learned not to get my hopes up... Oh well, poor, lonely and depressed seems to be my lot in life...
