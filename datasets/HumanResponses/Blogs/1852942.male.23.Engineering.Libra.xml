       Deep Thoughts.   If somebody said, "What about the cargo hold?" I'd say, "What about the porno hold," and nod slowly.

      Never trust a necrophiliac. They try to kiss you when you're sleeping and then say they thought you were dead, but that isn't right.

       Bumbershoot Is Going the Way of Deck-the-Hall-Ball   Don’t tell someone you hate something till  they  tell you what they think about it.  Techno, not to be confused with the broader term “Electronic Music”, is not an art, it is a craft. And it sucks.  Nu-Metal is for incestuous pygmies.

       Physics, Jurassic Park, and Bands That Don't Suck   Sorry people. The site was down for a bit. I think...it was terrorists.   I just finished up a Physics course at  urlLink North Seattle Community College  and the instructor, Jim Reid, was WRETCHED. He's a poncy Brit about 6'3" who sports a medium-short sloppy white hairdo, an equally white mustache, a lazy eye, a bulging gut, and an ever-present white sweater with a stain on it that he wore EVERY DAY. If you are considering taking a course taught by this man, DO NOT. He received all questions with an eager, though slightly maniacal grin, and then responded with blatent attempts at making the student look stupid and/or foolish.   STUDENT: *raises hand* TEACHER: Yes? *crazy grin*" STUDENT: "I don't understand how you got that answer." TEACHER: "Well, it's really quite simple, I used math. It's all right there. *shakes head incredulously, eyebrows elevated and mouth hanging open in amused smile*" STUDENT: *pained look* TEACHER: "What's not to understand? I've taught you this. You should KNOW this. You do THISANDTHISANDTHISANDTHIS and there you are." STUDENT: *slits own throat with sharpened Trapper Keeper*  Anyways, I did well in the class only because the textbook was very helpful and my classmates learned early on to help each other out rather than asking the teacher. I had some great lab partners as well. There was Esias, a Middle-Eastern kid about my age who always seemed impatient and could be hilariously rude; Bogey, a late 30-something with a comb-over whose country of origin was probably some place where people ate blood sausage; John, an average white guy jock who was always eating candy, and David, another white guy with this annoying habit of disagreeing with you through rhetorical questions.   It seems unfortunate that the hard sciences always attract the uber-geeks who have impressive technical skills, but little going for them in the social department. Only in the movies do you get characters like Jeff Goldblume?s in Jurassic park, a reasonably attractive mathematician who can dress AND crack quality jokes.

       The Secret Society of Couriers   What is up with these guys? They roll up only  one   of their pant legs, gather in large tatooed packs, and get along with each other as if they were all old high school buddies. Are there any rogue couriers? Courier arch-nemeses? Is this a whole urban sub-culture I know nothing about? Couldn't be possible. They're all snowflakes as well! The 13-year old, the guy with the prosthetic hook/hand, the short guy with way too much hip hop flava...every one of them is special. And do most couriers start out doing messenger work, or did they abandon the conventional work world because they weren't allowed to express themselves? I know if  I  was forced to wear a tie every day I'd tell  The Man   to shove it right up his Facist asshole. No WAY am I going to be controlled like that. Plus showering. I hate doing that.

       Nuggets of Gold.   I present you with a few quotes of my own. Use them freely throughout your daily life, but acknowledge their author lest you face the wrath of Rodak. He's that god that is all wrathful and what not.   "Come here Nipple Pup. Daddy wants to suckle on your teats."    "I like my coffee like I like my women. Weak and unable to defend itself."    "Don't poke a pirate's booty lest ye want to get stabbed matey."   NOTE: This one is only effective if said in a pirate voice.   "Don't open the coop less' you wanna play with the chickens."    "Wanna play Baby Bird?"   NOTE: This one requires a redneck accent.

       I Love a Lifeguard...       I'm going to have to give the "Tough Guy with the Most Dental Work" award to  urlLink Sara .  urlLink Derek's  is bad, but not THAT bad. MY dentist had to smash MY teeth as well, so big whoop. I did it myself in fact. I swallowed the pieces, fused them back together in my small intestine through the manipulation of excessive gas, and then reinserted them in my mouth after retrieving them from my poop. I DIDN'T get dry socket though. For the most part, it was a painless operation and recovery time, minus my anestheticized spazz. A filling in every tooth is astounding, but in a shaking-your-head sort of way.   Don't you hate it when memories disappoint? Nostalgia will do that almost every time. I saw the movie "In the Mouth of Madness" with  urlLink Sam Neil  when I was fourteen and thought it was bloody good. My mom and I had gone to see some other movie and were prevented from getting back home because police were blocking the main road; inside the restaurant they had surrounded some guy taken his wife and daughter hostage at gunpoint and the road was closed till they could resolve the situation. It was around 7 at night and we didn't want to take the access road back to Nikiski because it's not maintained well, so we went to go see "In the Mouth of Madness." I remember this movie being VERY disturbing and fascinating, what with all the upside-down crosses and the flesh beast at the end. The second time I watched it was with Derek at his house. We turned the lights off and I was all ready to be freaked out again, but the movie was a ridiculous piece of horror/suspense. Maybe it's Sam Neil? I saw " urlLink Event Horizon " for the second time a week ago and while it wasn't as terrible as "In the Mouth of Madness" actually was, but it was nothing great.

       You didn't have any money to go to the doctor? Were you spending money on anything besides food and shelter? THEN DON'T LET YOUR BODY ROT!       I can't feel the left side of my face, though this time I won't repeatedly punch my mouth to make sure it's still there. I learned that wasn't an effective method to neutralize anesthetic the hard way . When I was sixteen I had allwisdomsdom teeth removed in one appointment and received the anesthetic luxury package. The non-sensation of my face destroyed my common sense and after the operation I tried to pimp-slap my face back to alertness. It was fun spitting cheekfuls of blood onto the sidewalk to impress my friends who had come by with my mom to pick me up afterwards, but later that night I was dying of pain. Dental surgery produces an enormous, throbbing pain from within the jaw. It's a frustrating feeling that can't be touched, like a internal organ itching. I would have taken more pain-killers than was prescribed, but my mom was dishing them out and I wasn't courageous enough yet to play with medicine. After that night, I barely needed to take my painkillers and had a lot left over. I took one and called my friend Jakob to nevrously tell him I felt, "really weird."  The only other interesting experience I've had at the dentist is nodding off while having my teeth drilled. My mouth kept slowly shutting and the dentist would snap, "Wake up!" every couple minutes so I wouldn't bite down on the drill. Also, I strangled a Rabbi to death in a dentist's bathroom with the elastic band from my underwear and assumed the identity of Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb for the next five years.

       Excuse me, is your refrigerator running? Because if it is, then it probably runs like you...very homosexually!   The social rules in an office can be subtle and sometimes hard to grasp. It's not always apparent where social lines lie regarding acceptable conversation or behavior.  An obvious example is that you can't tell the woman whose ass is a pair of medicine balls strapped together with sweat pants to stop going to the snack machine with a handful of quarters and an empty sack. That would get you fired. Telling that same woman to only THINK what she's doing, not say it, would at least get you a reprimand. Here is a list that might help figure out what to do in troublesome office situations.   1. Learn from your Human Resources director. This person's job is to manipulate people. Listen to how they speak and you will learn how to control people with the imperceptible tug of a string.   2. Always appear friendly or at least approachable. Relax your face and look at it in a mirror. Do you look like a bitch? A grumpy, Eskimo troll? Regardless of whether you FEEL friendly, people judge you by the way you look and move.  3. Pulling the corners of your mouth towards your ears is not a smile. It is an obviously forced attempt at civility and makes you look unpleasant. Raise your cheeks upwards when smiling. A sly grin can quickly substitute and only takes half the muscles.   4. Modulate your voice to appear sincere when answering the most frequently asked rhetorical question in America, "How ya doin'?" This is a greeting and not a genuine query; so don’t be concerned with telling them how you actually feel. The easiest, most amicable reply is, "Great! How about yourself?" Also, listen to the person's tone when they ask you; sometimes a cheery acknowledgement of their presence is all that is necessary.   5. It is tiresome to exchange words every time you cross paths with someone, so it becomes necessary to greet people in a shorter manner. Try giving them a quick nod or, for the more socially challenged offices, looking straight ahead as if they didn't exist. Be conscious of which of these tactics your approaching target will employ. A friendly nod aimed at an oblivious recipient is awkward.   6. Become aware of your unconscious mannerisms. Do not fidget or cause undue attention towards yourself. It distracts others and causes them to hate you.  7. Do not look up gay sex stories on the Internet while at work. Your coworkers will find out and gossip about you being a disgusting old pervert.

       On your mark, get set, go! First one to the marker where that Pakistani girl fell through the ice after coming to the states to get treatment for her severely burned face that she got when the man she refused to marry dumped sulfuric acid on her wins!   Until only recently, the major internet and cable provider in the Seattle area was AT&T. I received my cable television and internet, as well as the worst service I’ve ever had, through them. All their customer service reps. were rude, illiterate, and were most likely fecalphiliacs judging from the amount of bullshit they talk to get out of doing work. Our internet would go out semi-regularly and I’d routinely get incorrect bills that, after calling up to have them corrected, would return to me unharmed. I put up with the bad service because they were the only cable internet provider I knew of and I didn’t want to trouble with DSL.   About 6 months ago Comcast bought out AT&T and the Seattle area was flooded with preachy advertisements for Comcast featuring people looking stern and nodding slowly, apparently silently agreeing with the narrator who was insisting the people paying him were so full of integrity they walk around with their butt cheeks clenched. The only thing that changed in the buyout was the name; all of AT&T’s employees kept their jobs, which makes me wonder why AT&T hadn’t informed people how much character they had. Probably too busy giving blowjobs to the Devil I’d imagine.  A few months ago my roommate, whose name the internet was under, moved out and I called Comcast to get it switched to my name. The Beast told me they’d have to charge me a Basic Service Installation charge for the switch. The fee was $60, but with a $40 rebate since they can’t do anything in a non-sleazy manner. I assume they do this rebate nonsense because either they don’t send out the checks unless someone complains or they hope the USPS is as reliable as it's bearded/ponytailed employees appear. I paid the bill as every little person must, and then had my service disconnected for a couple weeks because the lady I talked to about getting the name changed was a moron.   THEN. I unexpectedly decided tp move out of the house only a couple months later (refer to my previous posts on landlords and the spoogebag named Dan) and again with the fee. The fact that I was being charged for an install TWICE within a three month period gnawed at my brain with the persistence of a claustrophobic hamster. Luckily, when I called up Comcast to futilely complain (On a separate occasion my cable was out for three weeks. When it was turned back on I called to get credit for my time they wasted, but was told in polite business-speak to go have intercourse with myself.) I was connected to a nice lady who was easily confused, so I got one of the install fees removed. But, that’s all moot because I called yesterday to get my internet disconnected (I discarded with the cable TV earlier for the good of my wallet and imagination) and to speak to a supervisor about the abominable service I’ve consistently received. I spoke to “someone in charge”, who surprisingly, cared about what I had to say and gave me a full refund on my last month of service and fees. So, soon I’ll have DSL through SpeakEasy and I couldn’t be happier. My download speed should be around twice as fast as my cable internet was since DSL is a solitary line and cable’s speed is dependant on your neighborhoods internet usage. The people I’ve spoken to at SpeakEasy have been extremely helpful, polite, and everything customer service should be. I love them. So, the bottom line is  COMCAST RAPES BABIES .

       Personal stuff you're really not interested in.    I thought Akira was great; any art that features human flesh being warped into disturbing new shapes interests me. I thought the ending was a let down though. Only the very end with the spacey explanation of what happened to him, not the huge fight where he "phats out" to quote  urlLink X-Statix.   Wizards? The best animated film out there? You're crazy. It was disturbing when I was 7, but out of nostalgia I rented it not TOO long ago and realized it wasn't that great. Like the  urlLink Phantom Toll Booth . The nazi footage in Wizards were cool, but the overall theme of magic vs. technology was too blatent. I believe that fairy's boobs were always spilling out which titillated me very much when I was younger.   Ha HA! I was wondering when that would get noticed. Your name's misspelling was actually in retribution for correcting my grammar, though it wasn't neccesary since correcting people's grammar/spelling makes you look like an ass anyhoo. DEAL. I'll email you a suitable photo and once it's up I'll change your name. I suffer from name misspellings as well and I know the pain you feel.   My Sharp Toungue.   Aye, it was indeed my cruel words which smote Erin's blog. I was only defending the honor of all the good men out there that get blamed for the doings of skeeves, but I can easily forget that not everyone enjoys verbal antagonism as much as I do. I've apologized, but I think the Blog is dead forever.

       Holy crip, he's a crapple!   My Anthropology class starts Tuesday and it's DOOM. I'm sure it won't be very hard, but I've had almost a month of school-free time and have gotten used to it. Vacation should only be taken in small increments. Ten days at most.   Go check out "The Misanthropic Bitch" in my links if you haven't already.

       Mustaches.  To add to  urlLink Sara's  nostalgic recollection of our high school days, the best instances I remember from Mr.Birds class was when my girlfriend Moira was defending our generation of kids saying how "eclectic" our musical preferences are. Mr.Bird listened to swing and big band music and liked to get all Republican on our youthful asses about music, relegion, and whatever else was thwarting him that day. He was a great teacher, but a freak. He was one of those relegious people that showed kids pictures of aborted fetuses to scar them for life...and to prove a point I think. The other time I remember was a big class discussion we had on gay marriage and he, like many others, suggested if two gay men can get married, why not dogs or trees? I said I didn't see a reason why dogs shouldn't get married if they could comprehend a proposal and it's ramifications, and then respond. BUT DOGS CAN'T TALK YOU JACKASS. That's TOTALLY what I said and then I hi-fived everyone and he was sputtering and all "WHY YOU! I NEVER!" Then I walked out of class and tore up my homework or something like that. I never returned to high school again.

      In response to  urlLink Erin's  rant, what is your point? All I got from the regurgative spewing was MEN BAD, WOMEN GOOD. Why do people feel the need to justify their prejudices? A person might froth at the mouth snarling how much they HATE (insert noun), but if you intelligently question their reasons, they disintegrate to, "I just do."   Advice:  Don't base your opinion of what you think men are like from your experiences with internet chatting or the newspapers personals section. Men trolling for 110lb boob jobs on the net or in the personals are doing so because they are sleazebags. If a man walked up to you on the street and asked you what you weight was, would you tell him? Of course not. You'd tell him to fuck off. So what does some shut-in perv harassing you have anything to do with men in general? If you want to encourage pervs, go ahead, but don't blame every other man when the skeeve acts like a SKEEVE. It's like the tired out, forty year old, single woman smoking camel straights in a bowling alley complaining about how all men are dogs.   You ever look at the ad's for "woman seeking man" in the personals? What a gold mine of womanhood. I think you're looking in the wrong places for examples of good men.   Most men? In General? Where are you basing these inclusive statements on? From your personal experiences. So how do YOUR personal experiences apply to everyone else? They don't. The next step is always, "Well, everyone I'VE talked to agrees with me." Ok, so you and your group of friends is a large enough pool of data to reflect on the rest of society. I don't think so. I don't need to write about money grubbing women or ass chasing men. There isn't anything to say about sleazy stereotypes that would apply to people in reality that don't fit into the boxes we'd like them to. Women are shallow, but only about OTHER women and that is men's fault too. Riiight. "I'm a sexist pig, but only because my Dad taught me and his Dad taught him. Not my fault." It works both ways.   So, if you're just angry at men and want to spew, that's lovely. Everyone has to have a mindless rant now and again. But don't pretend those notions are anyone else's, let alone logical.

       Today in class I farted really loud, you know, to make all the guys laugh...and I swear to god it was so heinous, Suzy Johnson ralphed up her salisbury steak.   The weekend was a success. I found a ping-pong table in great condition at a garage sale for TEN dollars. Amazing. I also bought a cheapo bookshelf and then found a better one for tenth of the price at another garage sale, but I'm willing to accept that raspberry from God after the ping pong find.   Andrew, Katie, Carmen, and I went out to Hattie's Hat drinking and had a good time being drunkenly obnoxious...or was it just me? It's a fine place, though I've never drank in the bar, but why the name? I feel a little emasculated whenever I walk under their sign with the cute, little, hat with a flower poking out of the brim. They should have called it the raging hard-on. That would make me feel better. After that we went home and watched Family Guy for a while. I should be getting the second volume this week, which I'm very excited about, though I've watched all the episodes too many times on my computer.   Katie and I saw "Lost in Translation" with Bill Murray last night at the 7 Fables Theatre. The theatre, which I'd never been to, is great; the viewing room is fairly small and has these nifty chandeliers that retract towards the ceiling once the movie started. They only accept cash though, what's up with that? Get with it you lame asses. They wrote out my ticket stub on a piece of bark with a piece of charcoal too. Jokes on them. I ATE the bark and skipped their $4.75 rack of lamb. Right. The movie was great! I was worried because Sophia Coppela's last movie, "The Virgin Suicides", was a bomb. She did "Godfather III" as well, which I hear sucked big time so I stuck to the first two. Bill Murray did a amazing job and even got a little romantic without grossing everyone out which I was proud of him for. The blonde chick from "Ghost World", who was the leading m'lady, did great as well.   I watched Rocky II the other night and thought it was better, or at least different, than the first. Rocky was hilarious because it was so BAD, so I enjoyed it very much. Rocky II wasn't as terrible, though the whole coma thing was soap opera class shputz. I think Apollo Creed was a big part of the cheese factor. Was he supposed to be Ali? He spoke all crazy like he was giving a speech all the time, so perhaps. I'm looking forward to Mr.T and THE RUSSIAN, who I hear is everyone's favorite. But, if Rocky is the world Champion, does he only defend his title in all the next ones? The whole point was that he was the underdog. We'll see. And Sly is making a new one I hear! I hope he fights Indiana Jones. Man, Harrison Ford is looking OLD. But he's still a crotch-warmer, right ladies? Am I right? Is it just me?   Did everyone forget about the next Star Wars? When is that coming out? Does anyone care? I don't. Not unless they have a 100 Jedi free for all or something great like that. Or one HUGE robotic jedi that the dark and light jedi's have to defeat together. That'd be cool.    H.A.W.L. NEWS!  New additions to the H.A.W.L. League:   Angus McPastey , the street brawlin' leprechaun looking for his pot o' gold and a heap o' trouble.   Red-Eye Jack , the gun-slingin' outlaw out for revenge and Hefe Blanco's head.  Hefe Blanco , the Mexican assassin who murdered Red-Eye Jack's wife for a diamond pinata.

       H.A.W.L. News!   One ivory star has shone brighter than the rest in the Halloween Albino Wrestling League and his manager, Colonel Andrew Fouts, believes "White Chocolate" is about to go SUPERNOVA! Decked out in a 7" white afro, purple spangled jumpsuit, a crimson cape and boots to die for, Brutus "White Chocolate" Washington has brought the funk back into a league whose ratings “do NOT rock” as a result of generic characters such as, "Cap'n Pirate", "Todd the Ironworker", and "Rubix the Cube".    Colonel Fouts comments on Chocolate's soaring popularity, "Brutus stands a foot above all these otha' clowns, literally and figurahtivly' if you've seen his shoes. His fighting style and magnificent flaih' fo' excitin' the viewin' audience his proven his potential as a contendah' for the Eggshell Belt. He might be a minoritay' within the league because of his African ethnicitay, but don't take my boy for no "Uh-Oh! OREO". He is the real deal and by gawd, he will DESTORY the “Ghastly Ghost” on September 29th at the Snowball Bowl PROVING he is the greatest Albino wrestler of all time!"

       Women are not people. They're devices created by the lord Jesus Christ for our pleasure.   BAM. Great idea. The H.A.W.L.! The Halloween Albino Wrestling League. They only allow Albinos to wrestle and they must wear Halloween costumes. Albinos by themselves would be entertaining, especially if they came from many different races, heights, and weights. I'd like to see an obese, Albino Black man wrestle a small, Albino Asian boy whose cobra-quick agility would allow him to defeat the towering, ebony behemoth. That's a show. BUT, I think the Halloween costumes would do it one better. By the end of the fights the costumes would be torn to shreds and the real horrowshow part would being since there will be PLENTY of blood. There would probably be a goat blood gun mounted on the side of ring so the fighters could be hosed down intermittently. Andrew came up with this idea by they way, I only supplied the Halloween costumes and the blood.   Fiona Apple's new album should be coming out soon! I'm very excited for this one. Her second album wasn't nearly as perfect as her first because its tempo was too slow to keep her songs moving. Which reminds me, who the hell likes Ms."Don't Know Why" what ever the fack her name is. The song is catchy and weepy sentimental, but she didn't even write it! While this is nothing new, what with nobody in pop music writing their own stuff, she hardly wrote ANYthing on her album, and most of it sucks anyways.   X-tina got media-gypped on that Madonna kiss.  I predict the big Spears scandal will be in five years when her little sister, driven mad from living in her sisters shadow, starts a world wide, one person stage show tour involving nudity and intercourse with robots; a comment on America's self-destructive, materialistic society...or her womb or something. Stupid college kids.

       I'm the lord Jesus Christ. I think I'm going to get drunk and beat up some hookers.    Have you ever received an email or fax from someone proposing that if you launder a large sum of money for them, you will receive a cut of the loot? In the last six months I’ve received at least three or four, though I never noticed that all of these strangely similar documents came from Africa. A few times I replied to the sender under the nom de plume Tyler Durden, CEO of Project Mayhem Incorporated. My girlish delight at being such a trickster quickly changed to worrisome astonishment as I received a reply requesting I reserve accommodations for General Motombo (I’m not making that up), or whomever it was at the time, and fax their office information regarding myself, my business, and sometimes my checking account. I never continued correspondence past this point for fear of being killed on the street in a hail of gunfire from African mobsters in retribuition for wasting their time. Now whenever I receive one of these letters I present them ridiculous demands, such as 100% of the money, which aren’t received as badly as I’d have thought. Apparently, these emails aren’t as random or ridiculous as one might think. These scams are huge source of money and rank as the fourth largest industry in Nigeria. Don’t delete these emails when you receive them, report them. Go  urlLink HERE  for more information and send me five dollars.

        urlLink RE: Sara's blog    5' 7'' and 106 pounds? I'm surprised she didn't collapse the entire opera house with her enourmous, neutron star-like density. She WAS Russian, so I guess we can forgive her girthy physique.

       So... any of you ladies ever been penetrated?    urlLink Derek  is a filthy liar AND of Middle Eastern descent, may I add, so nothing he says or does can be trusted.   I have no recollection of eating bugs EVER, except for that fly that flew into my mouth when I was a child, prone to running around slack-jawed, but I digested and pooped him out, so he got what he deserved. It IS possible I've buried my memories of eating those praying mantids, just like Derek has blocked his OWN memory of tongue-kissing his cousin Chris at his thirteenth birthday party. Oh, Derek will deny it for certain, but deep down, it's there...lying in wait like a deadly, homosexual praying mantis.  Also, to prove that Derek has no idea what he is talking about, we were never IN Kindergarten together. The aquarium with preying mantids, which I did not EAT, was around second grade. Silly Derek and his silly lies.  Self-help books for people with big egos don't exist because our society is already cruel enough to dish out abuse without a second thought. We don't need books for that.  You bastard.

      When you’re out buying beer with your friends and one of them says, “Oh shoot. I don’t have any cash; I’ll pay you my half once I get some,” DON’T fall for it. This is the easiest way to get out of paying for a share of the fun. Once the sucker has paid in full, the debtor will never mention the incident again and will probably deny owing money till his conviently short memory is prodded sufficiently. Most people don’t know you can ask the checker to split the bill in half; then you can swipe your card to pay your half and your shifty friend can do the same. Then kick him in the balls because unprovoked violence is funny as long as other people are around to laugh!

       Daz.   Derek has gotten  urlLink his blog  up so go take a peek. Our blogs will be intimately connected in a homosexual manner, so when you check one, go check the other. You'll find scene commentaries, actor bios, and for...me...head...wha?

       Crafty Mexicans and their glass Piñatas.   For the good of race relations, make babies with someone of a different skin color; in fifty years we’ll all look the same and we can pool our prejudices towards a universal hatred of carnies. Also, in anticipation of Mankind’s future enslavement by machines, make love to your home appliances and perhaps we humans can score harem status in the new Machine society instead of doing manual labor in the energy mines.   I read an article in the  urlLink Crank  archives proposing Ferengis are Jewish caricatures. At first I was like, “NO WAY,” but after I read it I was like “WOAH.”  If I was an ant, instead of serving the Queen I’d defect and use the super-strength I gain from Earth’s yellow sun to conquer the aphids and serve as their cruel, black-hearted ruler.

       You know some...some people think that dandelions are weeds...but...uh...you know, I always think who the...who the hell decided tulips are so great?   What is the big deal with frames? It's wood. Why is it so expensive? It's cut wood. Wood. Fancy wood. That's all. I don't get. NOTHING makes sense anymore.  I ordered Volume 2 of "Family Guy", one of the greatest cartoons of all time. It's better than the Simpsons at their peak, and that's saying something.

       Star Wars Kid.   Has everyone seen this by now?  urlLink Star Wars Kid  is a heavily internet circulated video of a chubby, Canadian kid named Ghyslain who taped himself fighting off imaginary opponents with a long stick ala Darth Maul. While the original video is only slightly embarrassing for the viewer (Aww! Poor kid), some of the edited videos are hilarious. My favorite is one where they added in lightsaber effects on his stick and made it look like he was deflecting those cool red laser blasts we know so well. I'm astonished as to the following this silly, little video has got. My friend Andrew loves it and tons of websites have sprung up selling t-shirts and hosting the 90-some version of this video.

       Don't worry, I got an idea. An idea so smart my head would explode if I even began to know what I was talking about.   The lawn I planted in the backyard is finally showing green! Those bastard squirrels haven’t come back since I sprayed their access tree with “GETAWAY”, a liquid asbestos spray that repels rodents and Albinos. Actually, it doesn't so much repel them as gives them lung cancer within a decade or two, but they won’t bother future generations, which is the important thing I suppose. But now that I think about it, I don’t think squirrels live that long anyways, so I guess it only kills Albinos. Anyways, the POINT is that Albinos should have been born with sharp digging claws so they could live underground like they were meant to.    Why Do People Think…  Doing five seconds of stretching does anything? Running a flight or two up the stairwell and back down again is “good exercise”? They should start taking vitamins WHEN they get sick instead of before? That you’ll believe them more readily if they say “seriously” before they begin their spiel?  If Aquaman sucks so much, why is he still a member of the Justice League of America?   George Bush was convicted of a DWI in his thirties. That isn’t rhetorical question, just a baffling fact.   Don’t let children have pocket knives. Duh, right? You would think so.   Do you think Gwen and Gavin will last forever? Let's hope so.   Check  urlLink this guy’s blog  out. He just started it and it’s interesting reading even though it's obviously the way he wishes his life was.   I can’t comprehend that companies spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on copying paper. I understand why they do this, but it still hurts my eyes.   Don’t buy your kids anything but rubber balls and wooden blocks.   Go buy the “ urlLink They Might Be Giants ” Albums:  They Might Be Giants Apollo 18 Flood NO!

       Andrew Spoutz Puke.   I can’t remember the last time I’ve been drunk enough to puke, but I CAN remember the last time Andrew was. Saturday night! Andrew, Katie, Carmen, and I went to a party at my friend Shane’s house in Wallingford. We got there around 7:30 and were some of the first people there, so we got to start our little clique out on the back porch. I disabled one of the two kegs right off the get go; I pushed the pump down and it stayed down, just like the drunken frat boy I decked who said my mother "ran like a Welshman", which truthfully, only confused me. Keep that in mind when you threaten Ian Kristensen, or as I like to call myself, THUNDERBOY. I had Andrew violently shake a thin sheet of metal before I leaped through the front door to announce my arrival at the party. It was a gigantic success.   Anyways, we parked (porched?) ourselves on the back porch for a good while. We had a short, blonde, German fellow join our group for a good while; he and Andrew had a long talk about how much America sucks and Europe rocks. After more and more people arrived at the party our group started disbanding, Andrew and the German, Katie and Carmen, and I disappeared on my own after losing some fellow’s lighter to Andrew’s butterfingers. I walked around the house and joined the party from the front after having an awkward conversation with some strangers about  urlLink The Long Winters . There was a great jam band playing in the living room so I stood on the coffee table in the back with Shane for a better view. The band had all the garage’s standbys plus keyboards and were great barring the ponytailed guitarist’s singing. After a bit of that, I went and found Katie and we all regrouped in Shane’s room to bullshit before we left. That’s around the time when Andrew made multiple trips to the bathroom to hork up his guts. We left not long after that, so good times had by all.   Does anyone ever get those premonitions of self-inflicted disaster when they are standing on a ledge? I always get those at parties; I think, "Boy! I could ruin this party if I did this or that." I want that situation out of a teen movie to occur where some dork starts break dancing or shouts something ridiculous and the whole crowd points and laughs till he leaves. I would prefer it wasn't me, but it's nice to know I have that power.

       Linguini and Cigarettes.   What can I say about my buddy Derek Chivers? We’ve been good friends since elementary school and shared countless adventures. I will now count them.  1. We pulled off a prank when we were young scamps that I’m STILL proud of because of its perfect planning and execution. We spent a full fifteen minutes spitting “Fireball” juice all over my brother’s bicycle seat, then antagonized him at his computer till he became enraged and chased us outside. We had a good head start on him and, exactly like we planned, he went for his bike thinking he could gain on us. As we ran around the corner of my driveway I saw him jumping on his bike. We hid in the bushes/forest for a half hour until fearfully returning to the house to find him acting like it never happened. IT DID TOR. IT DID. By they way, my brother once threw and hit me in the head with a huge log BY ACCIDENT.   2. We built a campfire in my driveway (Alaskan driveway; large and gravel) after which we got into a fight about something. I remember my dad taking him home and both of us promising to erase the other’s phone number from our lists.   3. We recorded many promising songs on my piece-of-crap 4-track. Hey Derek! Remember “Speed Racer”? Yeah. It sucks. It must have changed somehow, because I remember it being unusually good.   4. I pulled off an AMAZING bike trick. We were both there, but I was the one that did it. He witnessed it though and WILL attest to such. When I was somewhere in my preteens, my Dad bought four 12-speed bicycles for my whole family. Some got used more than others, resulting in very different brake sensitivity. Derek and I had ridden two of them to the pit-stop not far from my house to goof off. We were taking turns getting speed built up and then slamming on the breaks to see how far we could skid, hopefully leaving vandalistic tire tracks. (I can’t believe that’s a word! But it is! It is!) My bike had terribly unresponsive brakes; I could pull the brake lever tight against the handgrips and still not get enough stopping power. Derek seemed to be getting much more performance out of his machine, so I offered we switch bikes and we did. I took a large, circular, acceleration course and, once speeding straight towards the pit stop, slammed on the brakes. Derek’s bike was one of the four that wasn’t used much, and so the brakes, unfortunately, worked very well. At the INSTANT I slammed on the brakes I realized my bike and I would be parting ways and with NINJASTIC athletic abilites I did the splits, thereby clearing the handle bars, and flew what must have been FEET in the air, and landed in a very excellent pose ON MY FEET while the bike violently flipped past me. AMAZING.  5. We strung a line of tripwire made out of cassette tape across the cross street by his house and then ran away squealing like little girls when a car drove through it.   6. We drunkenly attacked each other in a parking lot in Anchorage.   That is good for now. See Derek’s Blog (URL coming) for his additions.

       I'm joost Keeding!   To anyone wondering, no, I'm not anti-Semitic. I've got nothing against Jews or any other ethnicity. (Yes, that is the right word. Look it up.) I'm just a silly guy who thinks saying the exact wrong thing is hilarious. Of COURSE the holocaust happened and yes, it was a horrible, breath-taking period of evil. That is WHY it's funny to make a joke about it. Who said comedy was tragedy plus time? I don't remember. Of course, some one, say, a holocaust survivor, might not find me making light of the holocaust funny. That's understandable. But, it's the same with anyone's sense of humor. Somebody somewhere is not going to find you funny and they might even find you offensive. That is a chance everyone takes when they make a joke. Except for those filthy Swedes. Will SOMEONE give those people a sense of humor? Every Swede I've ever met has been DEADLY. If you see a Swede at a party, and I  guarantee  you'll be able to spot them, STAY AWAY. I'm just saying.

       Yay, and God said to Abraham, "You will kill your son Issac," and Abraham said, "I can't hear you, you'll have to speak into the microphone," and God said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better? Check check. Jerry, pull the high end out. I'm still getting some hiss back here."    If you could change one thing about yourself...would you kill a man?  TGIF! Right? Am I right? WHEW! Thank GOD. Because I hate my job and would like nothing better than to not be here. You ask someone how they are doing on a Friday and this is the joke. They say "Haha! It's Friday, right?" or something to the effect of that they can't wait to leave work. If you hate work that much, get a new job. But maybe they can't because they have a sick wife and can't afford to look around and all that. Oh. I never thought of that. Me and my BIG mouth.   I just watched "Rocky" yesterday, and MAN. That was a ridiculously BAD movie! It was extremely entertaining though, so it was a GOOD bad and not a BAD bad like, "Schindler's List" or something. What a joke THAT was! The Holocaust. What an imagination that Spielberg has! Anyways. It was BAAAAD. I know he was playing Rocky stupid, but he came off partially retarded. And there are FIVE of them?! I can't wait to see them! Apollo Creed! "That's not American. That's SMART." What the hell kind of line is that? And the ending! That wasn't an ending! They both beat the crap out of each other and then Apollo won. Then Adrien and Rocky exchange, "I love you!"s and FREEZE FRAME. Seriously though. Hilarious movie.

       "It’s a pleasure to see you, after 'Hogan's Heroes' Bob Crane got his skull crashed in by his roommate who was videotaping him having rough sex."    Sometimes I can't believe how sexist some of these old, black & white televesion shows were. Remember how Lucy always did stupid things and Ricki would yell at her like she was a child and then she'd cry? Or how Fred used to hit Ethyl when they weren't in the room, and then they'd walk in and act like everything was normal, but it wasn't.

I think they probably wouldn't like it, but if it was me, I would have worn a sun-dial. Just to be different.

       Since today is the anniversary of the World Trade Center, I'll share what I did when it happened.    I went bowling.   Layne came home from work shortly after I did. For a half hour I had been staring at the live video of the first tower collapsing, and after we exchanged that morning's most repeated phrase (Did you hear?), he joined me. We were both uncomfortably incredulous watching the first tower's collapse from our couch and not sure how to converse without being disrespectful. We've never been inclined to somberness and what was happening in New York required a gravity we weren't capable of pulling off with skill. Witnessing a disaster of such alien implications LIVE! on TV accompanied by forgettable newscasters performing their best version of grief seemed bitter. We left our apartment and coasted down Aurora Avenue trying to spot somewhere to spend our morning. We considered going to "Denny's", which has always attracted our spare time, functioning as either a human zoo or a shining example of bad service, but we weren't in the mood for either. One of us spotted a bowling alley, and since bowling was our current fake-sport obsession, we pulled in.  Bowling in a near-empty alley on a weekday afternoon made my elbows itch. Nothing in the building seemed affected by the news besides the TV. What slowly caught my attention though, was that this usually noisy venue was silent between the expected sounds of balls crashing into pins. The only other bowlers, a league of old men, weren't making any of the background conversation you usually ignore. Each one of them would carry his ball forward, toss it with varying difficulty, and then return to his seat. I never saw any of them talking, gesturing, or even shaking their heads.

       If Squirrels Have No Souls, Then What Happens When You Baptize One? I'll tell you. They Run Around Screeching While Their Skin Dissolves. What I Don't Understand Is How They Made The "Baptismal Drano Smoothie" In The Olden Days.   When we moved into our new apartment, the backyard consisted of dirt covered with rotting wood chips, a tree, and two, large, weird looking plants. Plus it's Fall, so the overall picture of botanical decline wasn't very attractive. I wouldn't find the yard so bothersome, except that one of the buildings we looked at when we were apartment searching was EXACTLY like the one we're in now, but it had a backyard like a rainforest, so I decided to plant a lawn and spruce our place up. I raked up all the wood chips, laid down fresh soil, and spread out grass seed. This only took five or six hours of work, but I could already tell the satisfaction I'd gain from knowing I CREATED this lawn was going to be suh-weet.   Katie's wisdom teeth were removed a couple days before and she wasn't feeling well, so she came home from work the next day around lunchtime to rest. She took a peek out the glass door to check on the lawn and saw an obese, bastard of a squirrel finishing up the eleventh hold he'd dug in MY lawn. Katie, the fearless girl that she is, opened the door and yelled at the squirrel to stop being a dick. Now, all the squirrels I've personally dealt with will vaporize if anything moves within one square mile of them, but this squirrel turned his head and met her stony gaze, as if to say, "I am not of this world you pathetic bi-ped. My mother was impregnated by HERCULES himself, and I have been imbued with powers unlike any other rodent before me. BEWARE! For you tread on uncertain ground, and your next move could prove disastrous for you health." Or, perhaps he was saying, "I wonder if I left the iron on. I don't think I did. Make the bed, pour the coffee, unplug the iron. Damn! Now I'm going to have to go back and check. Next time I'm letting the apartment burn down. I don't care. I really don't." Who knows. Anyways, then this insane, super squirrel started hopping towards the door! Katie, fearing for her life, slid the door shut (I'm not sure if she locked it, a wise move in any case) and continued her verbal assault accompanied by wild arm movements. This squirrel stood a foot away staring at her completely unconcerned, and then went back to digging his hole! DICK! That is my lawn! Anyways. Katie threw a rock at it and killed it and we buried it in our yard, so hopefully its decaying corpse will provide excellent fertilizer for our new grass. Ironic, EH squirrel? HHHHAHAHAHAHAHA!  And lastly, let's end all this useless bickering.  We all know Judaism ISN'T a real religion , so let's move on already.

       Look, if you can find a hole on the boy that you wanna put your lips on, be my guest!    Words I've deleted from my vocabulary:  Hate, Just, and Really.  People hate stuff way too much. It robs the word of its meaning! Now its "I hate Dharma & Greg" and "I hate people that do this or that." C'mon. You might hate the guy that decapitated your Grandpa, but not the guy that cuts in line for the express lanes.   "It's just that I..." "I just think..." USELESS.   "I really like your sweater!" Shutup. I hate sweaters.   FAVORITE MOVIES:    urlLink Sara Covich   is trying to put together a list of her favorite movies, but came up short after "Top Gun", so I decided to shame her with her inadaquate list.  Not GOOD enough Sara! IN THE COFFIN!   "Fight Club"  The movie was way better than the book. Brad Pitt does a great job laughing in this movie. A big rubbery one, big moosey, and something about boobs?   "Kalifornia"  Juliette Lewis does a great job of playing people that are either retarded or so screwed up that they might as well be. Not a good role to be typecast in. David Duchovny is a jackass, but he does ok in this movie. The other chick, the angry looking one who was the sassy rebel on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is annoying. Every role I've seen her in she looks pissed.     "Harold & Maude"  I hear they are remaking this movie. I assume it's because it was such a blockbuster juggernaut when it came out. I pray it will star Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, thereby immediately killing it and injuring all surrounding movies.  Ben Affleck rapes dogs.    "The Nightmare Before Christmas"  The artwork is amazing and the music is fantastic, though most of Tim Burton's other work is kinda crappy. Is Danny Elfman the only guy in Hollywood that writes soundtracks? He's EVERYWHERE, just like Jesus.    "Punchdrunk Love"  Adam Sandler is fantastic in this. Disregard the rest of his films; it's nothing like them.    "Remo Williams"  Willfred Brimley plays the head of a secret government orginization, CIA style.

       Dan, I Hate You, You Mustachioed Little Crap-squirt.   I'm DONE with the Northgate house and Dan, my former landlord. If you couldn't tell from my previous post on landlords, I hate Dan. He is a moron. Utterly. I pity the family that lives in that house now. I've been toying with the idea of introducing myself to them and letting them know about all the broken windows, the enourmous hornet's nest in Dan's compost heap in the back yard, the rug that needs to be THROWN OUT...not cleaned AGAIN, and most of all, how Dan is a slimy bully who will do anything as long as it doesn't involve him doing work. He'll even spend money over doing work himself, but most likely he'll just bullshit you and end up doing nothing. He hired his "bonehead" nephew to paint the house while he was doing whatever the hell Dan does when he's not teaching gym class for THIRTY YEARS. The nephew had his GIRLFRIEND help him paint. They didn't even scrape the old paint off! They just painted right over it. They even painted the shed/garage, even though it's filled with garbage, ANOTHER hornet's nest, and a gigantic pile of rotting lumber, dirt, and whatever else I found on the property that should have been cleaned up before I got there. YOU HEAR THAT YOU BASTARD? Not that it matters. He'll probably end up selling the property for land since the house is a rotting, neglected shack . I also padded the number of hours I worked on the deck. There's an extra $20 bucks in my pocket! Not. He charged ME for whatever he felt like. Since he hadn't paid me back for the supplies and labor involved in refinishing the deck, he took whatever he felt like charging me out of that and suggest I sue him. I don't care. I got back some money and am OUT OF THERE. Revenge isn't all it's cracked up to be. It eats at the cockles of your heart till you've no more cockles.   That reminds me.  Joe Johnson likes to fondle his mother.

       That Time When I Spilled Piping Hot Gravy All Over Myself.   So.   I went to a Naturopathic doctor.  Yeah, I know. *mimes masturbating* No, no, that's my conservative Alaskan side coming out. Stupid hippies. If you love your precious rain forest so much, why don't you marry it? ZING!   Anyways, I had a tonsillectomy a couple years ago due to my tonsils being inflamed and painful and the doctor who performed the operation screwed up. After the tonsillectomy I spent a fortnight or two eating jello and popsicles and letting my throat heal. (FYI, when your diet is liquid, throwing up is a pleasure) Even though my throat should have completely healed within a couple weeks, I was still feeling pain in a specific side of my throat, so I made another appointment with Dr. Burgoyne. After taking a look down my food-hole he told his clipboard that he "missed some tonsillur tissue and wanted to try some medication". I told HIM I paid for a tonsillectomy and would like the rest of my tonsils out, please. He countered with some attractive discounts on the proposed follow-up operation, but I respectfully declined. After carefully explaining my position on not paying for his mistake I was shown to the lobby while he and Virginia Mason's "Let's not get sued" lady retreated to a back room. They returned shortly and she was very happy to tell me Virginia Mason would write-off my second operation, which is something all hospitals are allowed to do to a certain amount.    I had the operation the next month and spent another couple weeks healing. I went back to see Dr. Burgoyne again because my throat was still hurting and it was difficult to sing or talk for long periods. He glanced at the back of my mouth and said the pain was, "probably acid-reflux. Go see a stomach doctor." Ta Da! What a guy. His obvious concern for my health made me grow a big rubbery one. I tell ya, doctors are dicks. Don?t be fooled, they work for the insurance companies. That might sound like cliche, jaded hippie talk, but it's true. I spent the next two years seeing various stomach doctors, throat doctors, general internal doctors, and taking whatever medications they prescribed. End result: a big, fat raspberry.   (Would you rather get a physical exam from a man or a woman? Either answer's reasons are strange to me.  So, I recently saw a very nice naturopathic doctor lady who, after talking with me about my health issues for a good hour, said she thought my throat pain stemmed from food allergies. She referred me to an allergiesiest...allergiesyologist...allergy lady across the hall that tested me. The procedure didn't involve any of those horrid scratches most people hear about; I held a metal bar in my left hand and she zapped my right hand with a small electric impulse. The equipment was connected to a computer with a database of foodstuffs and their energy readings. She'd select a food, zap my finger, and the computer would record how long it took for that particular substance to travel through my body. A number would then be displayed which indicated whether or not I'm allergic and if so, how much. Whatever. I'm no allergineographer. She zapped me and told me what I'm allergic too.   Now I'm eating bread made out of some weird non-wheat substance as well as avoiding chicken, pasta, and everything else that is lovely. She also gave me this little bottle out of which I take five drops, two times a day and it builds up my resistance to all the things I'm allergic to. It'll take a couple months, but I'll be dropping out of college to start another band ANY day now. HA HA! Just kidding Mom! I'm going to be doctor and run my practice out of an office in the downstairs of my three story house and I'll have way too many kids that keep growing up and moving back in and my wife will be a sassy lawyer with attitude that always kind of freaked me out when she'd act happy because she'd act way TOO happy and it seemed really forced. Oh Claire. You acted tough, but had a heart of gold. The End.

       The Renters Guide to Landlords.   It's difficult to get a feel for a landlord's character in the short time between seeing a house and signing the lease. Here are some tips so you don't get screwed over, dumbass!  1) If they seem laidback or easy-going, they are lazy. Things will not get fixed on time or at all. They probably smoke pot and eat babies.  2) Middle-aged/Older people hate young renters, with good reason or not. They might not actively try to screw you, but they'd be happy to see a young'un learn a lesson.   3) Security guards are usually sad, sad people with issues. This has nothing to with landlords, but still. No offense Jennifer!  4) Do NOT do any  major  work on your rental. The renter is not allowed to do any repairs unless there is a special agreement between them and the landlord. At any rate, you are working for them and that is not a good thing. Send them written notice of the neccesary reparis, wait the required amount of time (usually 1-2 weeks), then hire someone yourself and take the cost out of the rent.   5) Guys with mustaches are gross.   6) No one WANTS to be a gym teacher when they grow up. They end up as one. Keep that in mind.  7) When you do the first walkthrough with the landlord, do an insanely thorough insepection and write it all down. Take pictures. They can easily claim you are responsible for damage if it wasn't claimed at the start of your tenancy.   8) You know what I haven't had in a long time? Big League Chew.   9) It is illegal for a landlord to accept any money from you until a lease has been signed. It is NOT illegal to give them candy though, and who doesn't NOT like candy? C'mon. C'MON!  For more info on Washington tenant laws, check  urlLink here . In Idaho, if repairs on not made on time, you can legally KILL your landlord and store their body in a well in your basement. It's a loophole far too few Idahoians take advantage of. Of course, most Idahoites can't read anyways. Idaho sucks!

       Brilliant Shit!   My friend Andrew Foutz, whose last name isn't funny at all, had a brilliant idea and I curse him for thinking of it first. Here it is: Aquarium sized dolphins. Dolphins ranging from 2 inches long to, say, a foot, for the larger tanks. We've already had some fun with cats and bred some unlucky bastards to contract dwarfism causing their legs to be abnormally short and SOOOOO CUTE!  urlLink Munchkin Cats . As the site gigglishly squeals, "Short cats are all that!" So, why not fuck with some other animals? I want a tiny bear. I'd shoot him with a rubber band and make a Lego man hairdo out of him. Tee hee!  Also, a glow-in-the-dark car would kick ass.

       Porn AND Rock On VH1? Ew.   I would like to acknowledge Sara Covich for mentioning me in her Prosthetic Limb Fetish Site, "Attachable Love", by providing a link to it in my sidebar. Please visit her site and send her threatening emails from anonymous Hotmail accounts.   I would also like to acknowledge that Sara has the most disfigured taste in music I've ever seen. Def Leppard and the Top Gun soundtrack?!? That is sick. Sara once told me that while she was still in utero her mom would stand in front of a microwave with the door detached to "sterilize her little monster". No joke.   Yesterday's Bumbershoot was a mixed success. Katie, my wheelchair-bound Slovakian High School exchange student girlfriend (Hi Honey! HAHA. I'm such a jokester.), and I got there around noon and hung out at the Blues stage for an hour listening to somebodies grandma play some pretty good blues. We were at Bumbershoot primarily for  urlLink The Long Winters  show at the  urlLink EMP  Sky Church, so we drifted around and happened upon a band named  urlLink Ms.Led  (Get it? HAHA!) that played some great, dirty, girl punk/rock. Early  urlLink Hole  dirty; raw, but catchy. We got to  urlLink The Long Winters  show a half hour early and, to our vomitous astonishment (You can't use that.), the venue was already filled to capacity with more than 500 people futilely waiting in line to get in. We joined the rest of the suckers and shuffled forward as people, one by one, left the venue. There is a Jumbo-Tron with audio outside the EMP that has a live feed from the stage, so we knew we only missed two songs that weren't our favorites. The show was fantastic and the onstage banter was almost as entertaining as watching the bouncer behind us keep a pathway clear to the exit by herding confused fans ("You can bring the water bottle in, but not with the cap on." Seriously.) stopping in the middle of the pathway onward towards the exit. My favorite was the ugly, pudgy guy with the sombrero around his neck who kept trying to ignore a 500 pound security guard tapping him on the shoulder letting him know that if he didn't move he'd get his ugly, pudgy ass kicked.  After the show we decided R.E.M. sucks and we didn't give a hoot about Wilco, so we sold our wrist bands to the main show for five dollars and two cigarettes. I ate mine.

          Last night Derek and I successfully played a handful of Unreal Tournament deathmatch games. It was more or a less a tie; I slaughtered him to start off with, and then we traded places. The game runs amazingly on my new computer and, to my surprise, the connection between our two computer is great; there is hardly any lag at all. It's been so long since I've played any PC games. We even used a program called "Roger Wilco" that allows you to yell at each other during the game play. I'm trying to resurrect my old Mircrosoft Sidewinder joystick via a questionable adaptor, but I'm also bidding on a new joystick on Ebay, so we'll see.   My return to gaming was met with disruption of my home life as can be expected. Katie spent an hour making dinner and then I spent ten minutes finished up my game while my food got cold. By the time I heated my food up a little in the microwave, she was done with her food and angry. I was very sorry and apologized, as I haven't been that video game boyfriend for quite a while, but then she admitted once I didn't get off the game immediately she gulped down her food as quickly as possible to make me feel bad. So we both felt bad about being jerks and took a walk around the neighborhood.

      The weekend was a blind success. On Friday Andrew and I brought my computer's over to Shane's and we stayed up till 2 setting the new one up. We took a break to go get some drinks as files were being transferred to my new one and Shane's bartender friend served us some Long Island Iced Teas undiluted with water, which Andrew and I strained to drink as we were already well lit.   Saturday I picked up my record player from the repair shop in the morning and then went to the airport to pick up Katie. I made a big sign that said, "Smoochy Butt" so she'd know it was me, but she started walking in the other direction the instant she saw me and my sign, so I guess it didn't work. Later that night Andrew, Shane, Katie, and I went to see some Improv Comedy down by Pike's Place Market. I had been there once before a long time ago and it was just as good this time. It was mostly younger people in the audience and most of the girls looked dressed up like this one a big event. Shane was belligerent and playfully antagonized a partially receptive Andrew most of the night.   Sunday Carmen and Katie and I went down to Interbay to play some free mini-golf, which I destroyed both of them at with a 50 stroke game. Carmen hit one into the water, as she seems to think a straight line is the fastest way to the hole regardless of the course's architecture. Katie and I went off to Shane's later that night to get my fully functional computer. We were both really busted, but I played around with it a while before we went to bed. It's fantastic; Unreal Tournament plays great and I can have my my monitor displayed on my TV screen, so I can watch all my downloaded shows on it. It's all downhill from here.

      It’s KILLING me. Pull the back of your collar over your tie. For me, PLEASE. Also, get a nice haircut.   It begins tomorrow. If everything goes well I’ll have my new computer fully functional and all my files transferred to it. I can’t wait. I wish I could afford a DVD burner, but for the price, it’s not worth it yet. I download so many movies and TV shows, it’d be nice to be able to burn them to a DVD, but for now my setup is fine. I can plug my new computer into my TV and watch the video off of that.   I pray this is the last season of “Friends”. I can’t stop watching it because I’ve been at it so long; I need to finish it out. I can’t leave something 90% done; why not finish it so you can have the satisfaction of a job completely done?  Buy  urlLink Thicke’s CD “Beautiful World.”  If you need a reason, he’s Alan Thicke’s son.  I need to buy a mower, one of those manual metal contraptions, or perhaps a weed whacker. The lawn isn’t big, but it’s getting shaggy.  Jim from “J ‘n’ S Phonographs” has cleaned up my record player and gotten it running nicely. It needed a tune up considering it’s 30 years old. I’ve been looking forward to being able to listen to my records while playing ping pong out in the garage.  I finished Steve urlLink  Martin’s new book , “The Pleasure of my Company” and it was good. I read “Shopgirl”, another book of his, not too long ago and I liked it very much. In this new book, he used the word “promptly” way too much though. It’s easy to fall into because it fools you into thinking you’re being humorous in that matter-of-fact style only the British can pull off. I counted 3 uses of the word on two adjoining pages. I wonder how that slipped by his editor, because it jumped right out at me.   A couple days ago I had French fries, ice cream, and some of that Irish cream liquor for dinner while watching 4 or 5 episodes of “Home Movies” in a row. Hurrah! Katie is coming back Saturday.  Carmen, Andrew, and I went and played some free mini-golf the other day at Interbay driving range, which is near where we all live. The spontaneity of the decision helped calm my fears of being caught and my rock-solid constitution propelled me to dominate the game ruthlessly. I took 1st only by a couple strokes, but still. Kick ass. Katie trounced all of us last time we went, so it felt good to win, though I wish she had been there to see it. Last time we went I felt under-represented because for the first 5 holes I used the course’s clubs which have cheap, rubber heads and I didn’t do that well. Layne and I bought our own clubs a while back because we had become obsessed with mini-golf, so I ran and grabbed it out the car and my game started improving immediately, but not enough to overtake her score.   I made a nice batch of Phad Thai last night that was very decent. I’ve been practicing since Katie’s been gone; she usually cooks and enjoys it, a fact I’m ecstatic about. I’ve been doing my part as Man by fixing some drawers around the house and cutting things made out of wood.   In the near future, vegans will be horrified to learn that tofu is made from the souls of reincarnated animals.

      My alarm didn't go off today and I woke exactly when I had to leave the house, so I quickly put some clothes and deoderant on, grabbed my toothbrush and floss, and ran out the door with a big bowl of cereal which I ate on the way. I've got a terrible fear of being late, though this time I wasn't worried. Perhaps it's because I've accepted that nobody pays attention to anything I do at work as long as I don't screw something up badly. I got some generic Rite Aid brand Dayquill and Nightquill and got to work only 15 minutes late. I knew I should have shaved last night.  Seriously. Check out  urlLink Home Movies . What the hell do you mean you don't have time? You don't have time to watch a hilarious program? That's just lame. Why are you so lame lately? What do you mean things haven't been going so well? We had fun last night didn't we? We had a LOT of fun. You're just being jittery. C'mere. Yeah. Yeah, it's ok. Don't worry. Poppa's gonna make everything...COME BACK! No, don't do...*SLAM*that. Aw crap. Whew. Allright. Gotta get back on the horse. No biggie. I'm cool. You da man.

      That is terrible news. I've been a fan of Elliott Smith since I heard "Waltz #2" on the radio. The simple bass-snare-snare stuck in my head and I went searching for it, but accidentally bought the "Good Will Hunting" soundtrack, which Elliott did, mistaking "Miss Misery" for it. Luckily, "Miss Misery", which is a second best to "Waltz #2", "Alameda", and "Say Yes" on it, the songs that made me decide to buy more of his music.  I was able to meet Elliott backstage at a show he played at the Moore with Grandaddy; my girlfriend at the time had brought along her kid brother hoping we'd get a ticket for him. Some people working for the concert's sponser felt sorry for him and gave us all backstage packages including a t-shirt and some Motorola crap. After the show we went backstage and I watched people standing in line for him to sign their random Elliott Smith merch. I felt like a real ass and a groupie, but got in line because I wasn't going to pass the chance up to say Hi. All I had for him was the t-shirt, so he signed it for me after asking my name. I didn't tell him I knew how to play all of his songs, at least the ones I was technically capable of playing, or that I thought, and still think, "Waltz #2" is one of the greatest songs ever written. Hopefully his new album, which was completed not too long ago, is released. Double hopefully, it's not on the "special edition dead-musician line" and whoever releases it doesn't jack up the price since he's dead now.

          Oct. 22, 2003       LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Elliott Smith, a singer-songwriter whose dark-tinged,  introspective songs and plaintive singing voice won universal critical  acclaim, has apparently committed suicide, his publicist and coroner's  officials said Wednesday. He was 34.   Smith's body was found by his live-in girlfriend Tuesday, Los Angeles County  Coroner Records Supervisor Marsha Grigsby told Associated Press Radio.   He sustained a single stab wound to the chest that appeared to be  self-inflicted, she said.   Smith's New York-based publicist also confirmed his death.   Smith released five widely acclaimed solo albums that garnered modest  commercial success. His song "Miss Misery," recorded for the film "Good Will  Hunting," was nominated for an Academy Award in 1998.   Smith's songs were often compared with those of Alex Chilton, Nick Drake and  the Beatles, his favorite band. They were marked by intricate melodies  written over unorthodox chord changes.   Lyrically, they addressed such dark subject matter as drug addiction,  troubled relationships and loneliness -- though Smith tried to distance  himself from the label of confessional songwriter.   "I don't feel like my songs are particularly fragile or revealing," he said  in a 1998 interview in the Los Angeles Times. "It's not like a diary, and  they're not intended to be any sort of super intimate confessional  singer-songwriterish thing."   Smith was born Steven Paul Smith on Aug. 6, 1969, in Nebraska; his mother  was a singer and his father was a psychiatrist. He spent most of his  childhood with his mother in the suburbs of Dallas and then moved to  Portland, Ore., in high school to live with his father.   Smith studied piano and guitar as a youth and began composing songs when he  was 13. He began calling himself Elliott in middle school, he later  explained to a reporter, because Steve sounded too "jockish."   Smith graduated Hampshire College in Amhert, Mass., with a degree in  philosophy and later joined a Portland punk band called Heatmiser. On the  side, he recorded several solo albums -- "Roman Candle" (1994), "Elliott  Smith" (1995) and "Either/Or" (1997), all on independent labels -- that won  him a devoted underground following.   In 1997, he moved to New York City, where film director Gus Van Sant  approached him with an offer to use several of Smith's songs on the  soundtrack to "Good Will Hunting." The movie was a hit, bringing Smith's  music to a mainstream audience.   Smith subsequently signed with Dreamworks Records and recorded two albums  with bigger budgets that featured denser arrangements than his early work.  "XO" (1998) and "Figure 8" (2000) continued Smith's critical winning streak,  and took him to the middle reaches of Billboard's Top 200 albums chart.   "I don't really have any goals as a songwriter," he once said, "other than  to show what it's like to be a person - just like everybody else who's ever  played music does."   Smith had recently spoken in interviews about his struggles with alcoholism.  "When I lived in New York I was really a bad alcoholic for a few years," he  told Under the Radar magazine in an interview published in June 2003.   In an effort to quit drinking, Smith told the magazine, he had undergone  treatment at the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills, which  administers an intravenous solution meant to clear the bloodstream of  toxins.

      I'm very sorry for not posting more. I've been busy with homework and  urlLink Derek and I's story blog .  Go check it out; I think we've finally struck gold. It entertains me and that is all that matters.  Katie is in Thailand right now on buisness (Thai people pay top dollar for imported American kitten fur) and I'm going crazy. The other night I almost burnt the house down when I forgot I put a sandwich in the toaster oven.

       "So I got drunk, and I went into the parlor and said, "Give me a picture of that cow on the cheese, cuz I love that cheese. Give me the cow on that cheese. See this? That's right. It's the bannana lady from the bannanas. I get drunk one night, and now my body looks like a grocery store. Don't get a tattoo. Play soccer."    Ping pong is running at full speed in my house. Andrew and I are waiting for Luke, our friend in the Air Force, to get back so we can see how good he is. He proposes he’ll whup us, but I find that hard to believe. He had a table back when he had a job and played it every day, so we’ll see. He probably will destroy us.   Our health insurance at my job just went up, along with everyone else’s in the U.S. apparently. I now have to pay 25$ to SEE a doctor; it costs extra to be misdiagnosed and have unnecessary operations performed. From what I hear Canada has its own problems with Hospitals being over-booked due to the free health care. I hate everywhere.   The story Derek and I working on is going pretty well. It’s veering away from the tone we started off with, but perhaps for the better. The way the plot is going, I don’t think it can handle the mood we were setting. It’s all in good fun.   Watch “ urlLink Home Movies ” on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim.   I played the new Simpson’s game, “Hit and Run”, a Grand Theft Auto clone. It’s pretty good! The whole town is modeled as well as most of the characters. It’s a Simpson’s geek’s dream. It’s filled with references to obscure episodes and all that stuff that fanboys get off on.   Our neighborhood in Ballard is packed full of kids that are running around as children do everyday I get home from work as well as all day on the weekends. I was wondering when one of them would approach me seeing as how when I’m playing ping pong in my garage it’s on full display to the whole street. A 7 year old boy named Trevon, pronounces Tre’-von, has approached and latched. His home obviously is not all that it should be. He came over while Andrew and I were playing and talked our ears off till we had to shut the door on him to which he screamed on the other side of the door, “You guys HATE me!” It was unsettling, but what can you do. He’s started stalking my home, whizzing by on his bike glaring at me or waiting outside my garage for me. He’s a nice kid and is funny (“They needed bazookas to kill dinosaurs.”), but obviously is starved for attention. He was out playing ALL day, past sundown. We asked if his mom wouldn’t be worried and he said, “No, she’s watching a movie.” He also said there was some drunk on a motorcycle somewhere getting intoxicated off Mexican beer. I’m going to have to find a balance of being nice to him, but not TOO nice so that he doesn’t hound me.   I’m not sure if I mentioned this, but I recently purchased a cabinent record player for $40. I bought it from an estate sale, which was rather sad because the guy’s wife just died and he was selling her clothes which were STILL IN THE CLOSET. Yikes. Anyways, they still had the receipts and the system was purchased in 1970 for $400 dollars and it’s in GREAT condition. I took it into a record guy who’s fixing some minor problems, but once he does that I should be able to sell it at some later date, once I’ve tired of it, for at least that much.   My computer, the pieces more exactly, should be arriving tomorrow hopefully. I should have it set up by this weekend and I am VERY excited. I can’t wait to click on something and have something else happen instantly instead of after a couple seconds. It’s still a good computer, but not for the high-end CGI studio I run. Andrew wants to buy it for $200 and I’m inclined to do so. Once I get my files transferred to my new one I’ll give it to him. Little does he know there’s nothing in the computer but BUGS! MILLIONS of them! The fool.

       College kids! Gotta love em'.   Derek and I have started our cumulative blog story and it's been fun for US so far. I could care LESS if anyone else likes it. Really. It's located  urlLink HERE  and there will be a permanent link on my sidebar. Check it out regularly please.

       If you say Jesus backwards it sounds like sausage. If you say God backwards it spells Dog. Dogs like sausages. Hot Dogs are like sausages. I lost my shoe when I went to the bathroom.   If I didn't say so before, rent  urlLink "Love Liza"  with Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  "Do you know who I am? I am a BIG fan of radio control!"  I should be getting my new computer soon! Probably the end of next week. Then I can start doing all those things I always wanted to do, but couldn't because my computer was too slow, such as forming emotional bonds with other people.  Is anyone else concerned what the end of the last "Lord of the Rings" movie is going to be like? There's that nice, big old battle in the end and everything, but then all the bad guys dissapear with no huge bossman to be all climactic. I'm more excited for the spider woman and that old robot Gollum finds in the sand dunes.  Sunday night there is a big Weezer tribute show at Graceland. I might just go. Just just just.

          I originally planned to see “The Matrix Reloaded” in an IMAX theatre. I figured there couldn’t be a better place to see a movie with such bowel-shaking visuals, but I didn’t plan ahead and the movie was only in IMAX for a week, so I missed it. As time passed I cared less and less about seeing the movie till I almost entirely forgot about it; but the DVD just came out so I figured I’d give it a go. Let me say this: WOW. That is a BAD movie.   I believed all the talk about the bad dialogue and the creepy love scene, but it was worse than I imagined. I thought the visuals could easily propel a badly written script, but the effects were mostly the same ones from the first Matrix only over-used and slightly refined. The slow-motion time became irritating as well as boring after it was applied to every action scene. The actors in many of the shots were replaced with computer generated models to achieve stunts hard to create in real life; but the first short film in “The Animatrix”, a separate, completely animated companion to “The Matrix”, had better computer models than the real movie. The models looked like wax statues and moved like rag dolls, destroying any realism to the ridiculous stunts. As far as impressive special effects, the freeway scene has its moments and I’m sure is bowel-disturbing on a big screen. The twins’ ghost forms were a cool effect, but the villains didn’t get as much screen time as they should have.  With a better script, the movie could have been very decent, but the dialogue, as well as the acting, was astoundingly bad. Neo’s Christ status only served to give the directors something to geek off about ; it does nothing for the story. The love scene is disgusting; Carrie Ann Moss makes icky sex faces and we end up with a butt shot of Keanu. Lawrence Fishburne is a huge ass. He over-articulates all of his lines and moves so melodramatically he comes off like a drama kid playing “Matrix” with his friends. And why should I care Jada Smith was in the movie? I doubt the next Matrix will be much better since the Wachoski brothers had no time to listen to feedback in time to get the movie out this Christmas.

          I apologize for this boringly brief posts. I've been too busy with doing actual work to think up ridiculous things to jabber about.   Derek and I are going to write a story collaboratively via a blog. I'll post the address as soon as we get rolling. It should be absolutely terrible, so I plan to sprinkle some porn in there.  I was going to include an entertaining picture regarding prosthetic limbs with this post, but after searching for prosthetics under Google's image tab, I deeply scarred myself seeing some pictures of prosthetic face users. Don't make my mistake.

         In a recent speech Dick Cheny said, "terrorists are doing everything they can to get weapons of mass destruction that could kill hundreds of thousands of Americans in a single day of horror." He called the possibility of terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction "the ultimate nightmare" that "could bring devastation to our country on a scale we have never experienced. Instead of losing thousands of lives, we might lose tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of lives in a single day of horror." He added, "MUAHAHAHAHA!"  Hundreds of thousands of lives in a single day of horror? You can SEE the desperation in his face. PLEASE let me keep my job. You're all in GRAVE danger! There are blood-thirsty Mongolians at the Canadian border right now! Me and the gang can keep them at bay, but only if you keep us in office! This administration couldn't POSSIBLY get more vague with it's threats.

          Why are people astounded that  urlLink Arnold  was elected Governor of California? It’s not the first time an  urlLink actor  has been elected to high government. Perhaps it’s that he makes violent, action films. People prefer their governors to make movies with more depth? I can’t wait to see what happens when he molests his secretary and the Republican party scrambles to save his ass. Anyone remember Clinton? Guess not.   I think it’s interesting when people speak about  urlLink Republicans  or  urlLink Democrats  being this or that. Are they referring to people registered in that party, government officials, or someone who usually votes for that party? I know it’s fun to pretend one party is good and the other evil, but be realistic. There isn’t much of a difference between the two.    “I acted because I was not about to leave the security of the American people in the hands of a madman. I was not about to stand by and wait and trust in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein.”  –  urlLink George W. Bush   Yeeeah. What does North Korea have to do to get some attention? Saddam never had a missile that could even CARRY the imagined biological weapons more than a couple miles, but North Korea is breaking a treaty with us by developing Nuclear weapons, a blatant act of aggression, and we yawn?   Keep it up  urlLink Rush ! You’re doing a bang up job. I read a quote of him where he referred to Mexicans as, "those poor people who wash me."  "Sodomy, it's good for what anals ya."  I received a forwarded email from my coworker regarding the board game  urlLink Ghettopoly  and the  urlLink controversy  surrounding it. The game is a take off of Monopoly, except you build crack houses instead of hotels, rob banks, and so forth. While this is a great idea (I did something similar with the game of LIFE, replacing the situations with more realistic ones such as, “Condom broke. Lose one turn worrying.”) the creator, David T. Chang, chose to concentrate the game’s theme on Black stereotypes. I don’t find the games premise offensive, but I was amazed at the artwork the board features. In the center of the playing board, popping out of the big “Ghettopoly” title is a caricature of a Black thug holding a joint, a bottle of liquor, and an Uzi. The character is only a few steps away from having pitch-black skin and bright red lips. I wish people thought longer about what it is that offends them. They usually commit themselves to their knee-jerk reactions and end up shooting their argument in the foot.

      My Anthropology class is going semi-smoothly. The teacher, Abe Benjamin, seems to know what he’s talking about, but not at convenient times, such as class time. He speaks very slowly and stops often for long periods of time. I haven’t determined if he is recalling the necessary information as he talks or bluffing his way through a lecture. There aren’t many normal people in our class and one of the freak girls asked him a question about something that he only briefly mentioned, but he wouldn’t answer her question; he’d answer her with questions of his own and then look around the class like someone should say something. This went on for almost a half an hour with everyone either ignoring this obviously off-topic conversation (Me) or trying to answer these apparently rhetorical questions. We’ve the first of our fort-nightly quizzes tonight and if he doesn’t change his mind about our notes it should be a breeze. He told us we’re allowed one page of notes, handwritten or done on the computer; he didn’t care how we did it. SO, Katie and I wrote out all the material we’d need in Word, transferred it into Adobe Illustrator and fit it all onto one page leaving room for a labeled diagram of a skeleton. I’m pretty sure no teacher would allow this, but no teacher would allow a page of notes for a quiz, let alone say you could write it on a computer, so who knows. We’ll see, though I’m not going to be shoving it in his face.

          It isn't Febuary, but Valentine's Day is on my mind. I have nothing against it, nor holidays in general. Sure, they are commercially financed "special days" where consumers are bullied to buy whatever products are appropriate. Surprise! America is a Capitalist society. That doesn't mean these days need to be devoid of emotional content. Everyone needs a guilty reminder to buy others gifts as well as an excuse to get drunk. If it wasn't for Valentine's, Father's Day, Mother's Day and the sort, important people in our lives would be neglected and robbed of such things as twelve roses bought from Costco for $10.99, a tie picked out at random from whatever store is deemed "nice" enough, and generic bath products from wherever. This is all fine. But, getting back to Valentine's Day, my question is: How is a  box of chocolate an appropriate gift for a girlfriend? What sort of message does this present give? I would have gotten you a meaningful gift, but I know how you love to gorge yourself on cheap sugar? Flowers I can understand. They smell nice and look good. But why chocolate? What about a pie? Or a tub of ice cream? I admit I can grasp the thought behind a SMALL box of supremely expensive QUALITY chocolates, but the majority bought are chopped up Crunch bars stuffed in an inflamed, cordiform container. So please, do yourself a favor and instead of buying your loved one the most unoriginal, tacky gift possible, spend some time and sincere thought on your present. Spend all your energy on making this one day everything she'd hoped and I promise, you won't have to buy her anything else till NEXT Valentine's.

          Remember this guy? Rick Bender.    Boycott Ticketmaster. They bend their customers over like dewy-fresh altar boys every time. Most venues will sell tickets through their box office and it’s usually significantly cheaper. If the venue is selling tickets exclusively through Ticketmaster, skip the show. I know Good Charlotte is the greatest band since the New Kids, but relax; in a couple years you'll be glad their name isn't on your "Remember When?" list.  Rooney recently played in Seattle and I didn’t go because, even though the tickets were only $10, after Ticketmaster applied their fees two tickets cost almost $35. The only way these big business rapists are going to pay attention to you is if you don’t give them your money. It doesn’t matter whether they’re the only way you can get tickets to Avril Lavigne’s new acoustic solo show on the “Here Comes Reality You Stupid Bitch” tour. Is it worth $35 dollars to sit in the "water boils quicker" section of an arena rock show? Arena rock shows blow and you shouldn’t go to them regardless. I'm tired of feeling like I’m being held hostage in a Bon Marche. If the product is too expensive, don’t buy it. If the customer service is terrible, go somewhere else. If they’ve a monopoly on the product, it’s even MORE reason to not give them your business. DON’T BE A CORPORATE SLAVE! FIGHT THE MACHINE! DANCE THE DANCE OF LIFE! AAHH! AAHH! MY CHEST! OOOWW! Ohh. Oohhh…god. What? So…sleepy…

      For Halloween I'm going to be The Gimp, to refer to Pulp Fiction. I bought a cold-weather mask from Archie McPhees that looks like a bondage mask, but appropriate for hospital use. It's white and puffy and has holes for your mouth and eyes. Some stretchy straps hold it to my skull and with my shaved head it looks great; there is also a flap that attaches to the neck and hangs down over your chest. I bought some rubber gloves to go with it, but I need some more stuff. Archie McPhees had some long coiled phone cords and I thought I could tie those tightly around my neck. I'm going for whatever is most disturbing.  I'm not sure what Katie is going to be, but someone suggested I get tied up outside the door way and writhe and moan when kids come around.

          Kids want to get mail; any kind of mail, it doesn’t matter if it contains a thank you letter from Grandma or an unidentifiable white powder. At that age, having your existence acknowledged by people who aren’t in the immediate vaccinity brings you that much closer to validation as an adult. As you become an adult and start to receive bills and junk mail exclusively, the mailbox gains a repulsive quality. You regularly walk past with your eyes locked forward, blatantly ignoring it as if it were a legless, skateboard-riding beggar. Eventually, the “overdue bill” hot flashes force you to strangle the thick wad of cheap, ad-covered paper and take the mass inside to fearfully root through it. But, one thing can instantly redeem the United States Postal Service as a bearer of good things: a package. Nowadays, nothing brings the world so much happiness as the plain, brown, cardboard box with the grin on its ass. It’s irrelevant if the item is an unexpected gift or merchandise you ordered yourself; it’s always a surprise. If a postal worker called you to tell you, “Jason, your package will arrive at exactly 8:32am,” you’d say, “My name isn’t Jason and how dare you address me by my first name. But, I appreciate your commitment to an expeditious delivery.” Then he’d say, “Expeditious? What, did you look that up in a thesaurus or something? That sounded pretty awkward. I always practice saying a word I'm not familiar with a couple times before breaking it out in conversation,” then YOU’D say, “This comedy tool has run its course, I say good day Sir.” And there you have it.  It’s a disturbing feeling when you meet eyes with someone through a restroom stall’s door cracks. The unique mix of shame and anxiety that stops your heart when it happens is hard to recreate.

         The British midget, Lord Littlebrook, was Midget World Champion in the early 1970s. He trained many of the midgets that followed the pioneers in recent years.   Every few months my company distributes a BPI (I've no idea what that means either.) ratings sheet to each of its employees. This sheet has a number on it which rates that employee in terms of how much unnecessary work they make; the lower the number, the more efficient that person is. One would assume employees who consistently receive exceedingly bad numbers would be reprimanded and eventually, passively ejected from the corporate body. It appears this sheet's purpose is only a semi-public (the sheets are color-coded and eyes immediately target red) way for upper-management to flaccidly chastise. A certain fleshy comb-over that undoubtedly gets fatal marking on his BPI is a constant pain in every department's foot and yet he persists. What is most frustrating is that regardless of how much trouble he receives from pissed off co-workers in return for his ineptness, he learns nothing. Though, as of late, I have to give him credit for doing better, even if it's only till he thinks he can slide by with some mistakes since he's been so good.   No matter how much I verbally condemn someone, I can't genuinely hate them. I don't believe anyone can truly be evil because I think harmful people are usually the result of unhappiness or abuse, so I can't pin the blame on them. Some people can be malicious, but that is an immature trait and generally harmless. I've yet to genuinely wish death and destruction on anyone for very long. The longest was a kid I went to school with named Joe Johnson. One quarter we had an independent class together under the supervision of Mr. Morin which mostly involved goofing off. Even though we came from very different cliques and otherwise would have disliked each other, we had a tentative friendship to make the class bearable. Joe's parents bought him a Super Nintendo and asked me if he could borrow mine. I was still hopeful to branch out and make new friends, so I lent him all twelve ($35-45 dollars x 12 = approx. $500) of my games since I rarely played them.   After a month had gone by, I meekly asked him about getting my games back and he promised he'd get them back to me soon This line of questioning continued for the next two or three months with each excuse of his getting more and more unreasonable. Finally, after I started asking him every other day, he said he lent them to a friend of his who sold them. Around this time I started getting very aggressive, which wasn't very for me at the time, about getting them back. I threatened to sue him and even asked his Dad to pay me back. His dad, who was more than familiar with Joe's dumbassery, said his son would have to handle it himself. A convenient stance for a dad whose son was a small time punk. At this time I was getting ready to move to Seattle in a couple months and after researching the possibility of suing Joe, realized I'd have to physically be present in Alaska to do so and I dropped all thoughts of getting my money back. I started planning ways of hurting this kid; I played with the idea of assaulting him, but I wasn't a fighter and had only physically damaged other kids when I was younger. The most likely prospect seemed to be vandalizing his car and I started to mentally figure out how I would do this. But, I was never cut out for such immature destruction and had done nothing by the time I moved to Seattle. I talked to my friend Jakob, who still lived in Alaska, on the phone every once in a while and I asked him if he'd do something terrible to Joe. He said he would and I felt better; Jakob was always better at spontaneous acts of insanity and I trusted he would fulfill my revenge. He never did, but later he told me Joe had gotten a girl pregnant and then joined the Army. I have accepted this as punishment enough and resolved to attack Joe if I ever saw him again, perhaps first somberly asking him if he knew who I was before clawing his eyes out like a little girl. This probably won't happen as all my rage has evaporated. A year or two ago my friend Layne and I were having some beers in a bar when he asked me about Joe. I stared at the wall and realized I had completely forgotten about him and my intense hatred of him had slithered away. This was slightly heartbreaking because I had been really intent on killing him someday. I've learned it's far better to cut your losses with situations like these, but that doesn't I can't take pleasure in his misfortune. The pack was new Joe. How'd the condom spring a leak Joe? A SINGLE NEEDLE.

        "The robber struck the blindfolded Jesus and yelled, 'Save me? Who's going to save YOU?' Thanks to their telepathic mind-link, Billy was already hatching a plan to free Jesus from the jewel theives' clutches."  -An excerpt from "Jesus Christ and Billy Jones Save Manhatten.    Happy birthday to me! I am now 23 and as wise as I could possible be. Except for that time I spilled piping hot gravy all over myself.  I'm constantly looking at how I speak and write and I share  urlLink Derek's  dismay at the decline of some people's vernacular. Abbreviations are a good one too. I predict in ten years all the teens and early 20-somethings (should I hate that word? It FEELS like I should.) will be using abbreviations more than filler words like "fuckin'" and "like." OMG! I totally heart your new BF! Of course, these people read Teen People. But so do I. Only for the makeup tips though. Plus, this one time in gym class I tripped and my ass was TOTALLY showing and the guy I liked saw EVERYthing. I couldn't believe it.   Ok. Had a little trip up with SpeakEasy, my soon-to-be internet provider, but it's back on track now. I'm very uneasy considering how terrible Comcast/AT&T turned out to be, but I've read tons of reviews customers of theirs wrote and overall it looks good. The sales rep I talked to said that with my new connection I can download approximately 20 pornographic pictures per second, which seems pretty fast to me. The human eye can only register about 15 per second, so anymore would be useless.  Ever had a San Francisco Iced Tea?

          Oh sweet mother of MERCY I am in heaven. I've been downloading  urlLink emulators  which are programs for the PC that mimic other systems and run their games, such as Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Colecovision, Commodore 64, just about anything someone wants to play. I've got a buttload of Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Super Nintendo games, but I downloaded MAME, an aracade emulator that plays arcade games anywhere from 1980 all the way up the early 90s. Obviously, one of my favorites was Rampage. What's even more killer (Did I say that?) is that since they're exactly like the arcade games they emulate, all you have to do to put in another quarter is push a button. Another one of my favorite games I never got to beat was  urlLink "Bad Dudes."

            urlLink "The Last Samurai"  was pretty decent. Their were some great fight scenes and a couple of the full-blown war scenes were very good. Otherwise, the acting and plot weren't that great; not bad, but not great. Tom Cruise isn't a terrific actor, just a decent one; and all his co-stars followed suite more or less. Probably not worth paying money for which I'm happy about since I didn't.  I downloaded  urlLink "Elf"  with Will Ferrel the other day and it was better than I thought it'd be. From the reviews I was expecting an overly simple kid's movie, which it mostly was, but it still had a good amount of laugh-out-loud scenes. Will Ferrel is the best when he's given a lot of space to be weird and though he was allowed to adlib a bit, ("You don't smell like Santa.") most of the humor was harmless. I need to rent his SNL best of.   Thanksgiving with Katie's parents tommorow! I'm excited for all the food. Her brother's girlfriend is allergic to wheat as well, so I think I'll be able to a lot since Katie's parents are trying to make food we can all eat.   Monkey ran into the wall this morning while chasing Bojee. An honest mistake.   David Cross isn't as great as I thought he was.  urlLink "Run Ronny Run"  was terrible and he dissed  urlLink Sifl & Olly's  song "The United States of Whatever" which immediatley puts him on my list of people that don't "get" their genius and therefore are TOTALLY lame.

      The more I learn about David Brent, the head manager on "The Office", the less he becomes funny and the more it becomes sad because he does such a fantastic job of being not only a bad boss, but a sleazy person desperate for attention and admiration, which is not an unfamiliar description of some people in the work place. It's still a great show though.  The story blog is growing a bit rusty, but I'm sure Derek will post any day now. Keep your eyes open.  I'm going to see a free sneak preview of "The Last Samurai" today. I haven't heard a lot about this movie, but I've heard buzz about it for a long time and it's an epic war movie, so hopefully it turns out good. I like Tom Cruise for no reason other than he's an awfully charming, attractive man; I don't find him an especially great actor, but a decent one at least. Those epic war battle like "Braveheart" and "Saving Private Ryan" are great when done well, but I've never seen one set in Feudal Japan, so that should be lovely seeing samurai behead each other.  I've about 180 Nintendo games for my PC's NES emulator and I'm SO excited. I'll be getting the gamepads shorty and soon Katie, Andrew, and I will be playing "American Gladiators", "Mike Tyson's Punch Out", and "Joust" till all hours of the morning...or perhaps it'll be just me. Anyways, I've got a crapload of Sega Genesis games as well and I'm looking forward to getting an Apple IIGS emulator running as well as a Turbo Grafx one. The Turbo Grafx was a strange system that was supposedly much more advanced than the Nintendo or Sega Genesis, but I'm not sure where they were. They weren't foreign so much, but I didn't know anywhere that sold them.   We're taking Monkey in to get some antibiotics for his...HER cold. I keep thinking of her as a boy because she's always playing and running around. Bojee has warmed up quite a bit and is mostly well now. She seems to take recharging every day because in the mornings she's a bit skittish, but by the time we get home she's pretty friendly.

          Check out "The Office", a British sitcom. I downloaded some episodes off Kazaa and it's hilarious. I really haven't seen much British TV besides "Absolutely Fabulous", which was terrible, and some of those kooky space shows they have. It's really hilarious and the humor is much more subtle than I'm used to from watching American TV.   I got a new ping pong net. It's neat.   Yesterday I woke up 10 minutes before I had to go to work, but wasn't really bothered by it. It was nice getting the extra sleep. Yesterday and today both felt as if they were the weekend and I don't know why. Do many people my age get up early on weekends? I can't stand getting up later than 9am on weekends; it makes me feel depressed and lazy, regardless of whether I have any plans.

      Nothing much new to report besides my wish to see a shaved monkey. A gorilla would be fine I suppose, but that'd be even more disturbing.  For the last week or so I've been on my new diet where I don't eat anything I'm allergic to. It's gone well so far even though I'm allergic to most meats besides beef and I can't eat anything with wheat in it, which rules out bread from just about anywhere. I can't eat spelt or anything with rye or sunflowers in it either, so we get this Kamut bread that tastes pretty good and isn't that wierd. I've got a sheet from the nutritionist at the doctor's office I went to, so we can figure out what to eat every day, but I'd never be able to do this without Katie's help. She's been cooking stuff every night for dinner as well as lunch, since I can't go out to eat anywhere.   Our cats are doing well. Monkey is the social, energetic one, though Bojee is doing better. I played with her last night and fed her tuna and she fell asleep with Monkey and Katie on the futon. She'll spook if you make any large, scary movements or sounds. She's not too skittish, but it'll be a couple of weeks before her and Monkey are tearing up and down the hallway.   Our Anthropolgy teacher is a COMPLETE moron. He decided he wouldn't come to class this Thursday for whatever reason, so our test is being adminstered via email and we're to use the "honor system." We get review cards at the end of the quarter to comment on our teachers performance, but I'd like to write up a one page commentary on his performance. I was going to give my physics teacher a scathing review, but writing everything down I had to say in the last 10 minutes of class didn't do it justice. I suppose I'll just keep it concise for whoever reads them. Teachers are supposed to make up time they lose for not being in class, but he's not doing that at all besides his lame suggestion anyone who wants help sees him before class. What an idiot. He's pretty old, so it's too bad, but he really shouldn't be teaching.   Katie and I have watched a few episodes of the British sitcom, "The Office" and it's hilarious. Very well done. If you liked "Office Space" you'll like this even more because it's done in a more documentary style and so the characters seem much more realistic.   Is there something about entertaining political commentary that lends itself to song?

      God. Almost a week since my last post, and I doubt I'll get much better.  urlLink "My First Impression was Wrong"  is still running semi-smoothly and I think it will end up as a success. Most likely we'll plow right through the ending and start another story, probably of a much different style, so I'm looking forward to that. Not to say our current stories style is bad, but I'd like to do an epic romance entitled,  "Love, down yonder ye shall go M'lady."   We've been playing  Unreal  quite a bit and I try to play every chance I get, regardless of whether I actually want to. Video games have always been an addiction for me because I was denied them as a child till I was 16. I bought HINT books for games I didn't own for systems I didn't own because I liked reading about them and imaging playing them. That is so sad.  Downloading is a hobby of mine; If I can find something free to download, hopefully a large set of things, I will do my best to collect them all. I recently got some  NES ,  SNES , and  Sega Genesis  emulators working and I've already got an enormous collection of ROMS, games that is. Have I played them yet? No. Will I? Probably not, but it's fun to have them. If someone let you loose in a Best Buy outlet and said you could take anything you wanted as long as you didn't resell it and you did all the work of picking up and transport the merchendise, don't you think you'd end up with a bunch of stuff you've no use for?

          Check out  urlLink The Postal Service  and  urlLink Starlight Mints .   THIS time, I blame all of YOU for me not posting lately. Next week, the Pope gets the blame. What's HE going to do in retaliation? He's old and feeble! I'd box his ears if I could through his super secret squad of Bishops.   Has anyone seen that pro-life commercial with the firewoman who says she’s glad her parents didn’t abort her because she saves lives for a living? Yeah, but who KNOWS how many people she DIDN’T save from the burning inferno. Think about THAT.  Today I received a call from a telemarketer who was trying to weasel her way into getting our copier’s serial number. I get these at most once or twice a week and I have a lot of fun with them. I haven’t figured out a way to spell out “telemarketer” in the format serial numbers are made in, but I still try to get them to slip up. I happened to be chowing on some homemade sushi, so when Suze asked me if I could “please go get me the serial number” I ran her through the regular questions. “Who are you”, “what company do you work for”, “Who’s your contact here”, all while chewing noisily on sushi. She paused and asked, “Are...are you eating?” I said I was having a little lunch right now and she stuttered because I could tell she wanted to tell me it was very rude to chew so noisily into the phone, but then she remembered she’s doing something illegal, so thought better of it. So, I told her I could easily get her those numbers if she’d give me HER number, but she opted to just call back. If does I’m going to say, “Hey Suze. Listen, I was just bullshitting you before. I know you’re a telemarketer.” And then, maybe, just to scare her, tell her her son’s name.

          I found a post I lost due to butter fingers. It's from about a week ago.   --------------------------- I’m halfway through Chuck Palahniuk’s novel, “Survivor”, which is about one of the last survivors of a suicidal cult. I read “Fight Club” because I loved the movie, but the book wasn’t nearly as well done as the movie. Palahniuk tries to make his characters’ disturbing eccentricities seem mundane and matter-of-fact, but “Survivor” is the only one I’ve read where the story isn’t overshadowed by his desire to come off as edgy  I’m going to improve my handwriting. I’ve always envied people that have consistently neat handwriting; but it takes focused concentration for me to write legibly, so I predict this won’t last long.   P.S. I’ve also taken up hand-making functional shuttlecocks out of cooked spaghetti and superglue.  Wow. You think spare time would be a good thing, which it would be, except I can’t APPEAR as if I have free time, so that drastically limits what I can do at work when there is none. I surf the net at the public PCs, (Surf the net?! I didn’t say that.) since I don’t have access at my computer, but I can’t plant my ass out there for obvious reasons. So, here I am, thinking of things to type up. I’d write another addition for “My First Impression Was Wrong”, but it’s Derek’s turn. What I’d most like to do is go over to “J ‘n’ S” and get my record player, then go to Shane’s house and get my computer up and running; but I still have two and a half more hours to go. Tomorrow I’ll be picking my record player up, picking Katie up from the airport, spend the next couple hours reacquainting myself with my girlfriend over tea, and then going to TheatreSports at Pike’s Place Market. TheatreSports is a judged improv comedy show made of two teams of comedians competing against each other to come up with the funniest material. The losers are humanely destroyed. ---------------------------

      I am VERY sorry. I'm been a bad parent. I've neglected you. You've every right to hate me. I always promised myself I'd be a better parent than MINE were when I was your age, but here I am repeating their same mistakes. I'll never let it happen again. I PROMISE. Do you want to do something today? Let's go to the mall! Let's go get you some new shoes, or clothes! Great. You know, I miss doing stuff like this. Just the two of us. We should do this every week. Next Sunday? Oh....um...I've got a thing then. Um...how...about...next Tuesday? Around 2? Oh, right...you go to school. Shhhooooe. Oh, we'll figure it out. I love you Brittney. More than you'll ever know.  My time has been commandered by Unreal, School, and other super-important things. We had Halloween last Friday, as did the rest of you I'm sure, and we waited around for kids to come by for two hours till we gave up and went out. We've got at least 7 kids in the neighborhood who are out in the street playing everyday I came home from work, but not one of them showed up. I saw Pudge, he's the chubby blonde kid, dressed up in his Sponge Bob Squarepants costume and his mom was driving him somewhere ELSE to go feed his fat face. There were a TON of kids walking down Market St, which is the main road, but none of them came up the street towards our house. Isn't that the opposite of what happens? You're not supposed to walk your kids along a busy road people! Irresponsible parents. They probably let their kids EAT their candy instead of throwing it all away at the end of the night and telling them this was the last Halloween EVER because pumpkins have become extinct from some genetic thing.   Sunday Katie took me out to see They Might Be Giants at the EMP Skychurch and it was an amazing show. There was a manic quality in the air that had me a little on edge throughout the entire set. They had a impromptu two-piece opening band that was a little sucky, but pretty smart, then it was about a half hour till TMBG came on. John Flansburgh was very animated and drove the show with his concious rockstar posturing and monologues inbetween songs. They played a lot of stuff they didn't play at the last show I went to, plus, this one was much more "live" feeling. They had some small tech. problems that was driving Flansburgh crazy, though he didn't let on much. They did some small, funny, jam sets as well. Their freaky German-looking guitar player could really shred. We got home at 11:30pm which was lovely and I have mentioned how f'in cold it is here? I care here to get AWAY from the cold, but my bitter, empty, heart drug it along. Also I don't like beards.

          It snowed today! Wussy Seattle snow, but still. My office is up on the 32nd floor, so I got a great view of the blizzard, but most of it melts by the time it gets to street level. I WAS worried for a little while though, but then it abruptly stopped snowing.  New Year's...Eve? Is that what you call it? Katie and I are going over to Tim and Carrie's to party down. Andrew and Travis and Donnie will be there as well and we'll have a good time. New Years has always been a boring half-holiday for me. My dad would always drag me out on the porch and give me a small glass of wine and ask me what my resolutions were, then I'd roll my eyes and say, "Nothing." It's all a little cheesy making resoultions on a special day and whatnot, but I suppose if I was addicted to crack, it'd give me something shoot for, wouldn't it?   I've recently started drinking martinis. Not foofy ones, just vodka, vermouth, and maybe a little lemon. Shaken, not stirred. It gets you lit quick and tastes pretty good! I've even grown to enjoy a couple green olives in the drink. I've always hated black olives because they looked and smelled gross, but I can't say I've ever eaten a raw one. Eating is a lot about texture and appearance for me. Oysters are rather good, but they are so disgusting and slimey I can't bring myself to eat them. They look like cut-up baby hamsters.   Work on  "Low to the Net"  is coming along very nicely. I've written two full scenes and have started a third. Writing as screenplay is taxing because you have to describe each shot, where the camera is and what the camera is doing. It's fun picturing the shot and how you want it to look though. This movie is a lot easier on me than a completley original one because it's basically a spoof on 80s movies. We're including, along with our sick love for ping-pong and our brilliantly retarded humor (You dorked my wife! I hate you!) , a mish-mash of 80s movie moments, so it's all recycled.

      A brand new day! Sting! You asshole!  Andrew, Katie, and I went out to Bad Albert's last night to unofficially celebrate my end-of-the-year money package supplied by my work. I'm being vague because this is a semi-public page. Po' Boy sandwiches are good!   I got a new watch. A Diesel with a large, square, grey face and a black leather band. It's boss.  Katie and I watched the last "Lord of the Rings" movies and it was great. There were a few strange parts that either made you laugh at innappropriate times or cringe from on-screen emotional goopiness. Seeing Gollum ride an invisible, bucking Frodo was hilarious and the Albino Orc was a pleasure.   I've been playing the  urlLink Patrick Park  CD Katie bought to death. I saw him once when he opened for Liz Phair at the  urlLink Showbox  and recently at a solo show he did at the  urlLink Tractor Tavern . You know, I think I've said all this before. Oh well. He deserves the miniscule word-of-mouth advertising I can supply.

       BRAND NEW POST!   I am ashamed and embarrassed to have let my blog go for TWENTY days. That is inexcusable. I have decided to take the pressure to come up with universally hilarious material of unsurpassed wit off myself and revert to a more classic blog comprised of a record of the banality of my life as WELL as any genius that happens to strike me.   Get this: You park in a driveway and drive in a parkway. Now, pretend I'm staring at you as you avoid my eyes uncomfortably.  Xmas was great. The first half was spent being showered with gifts at the Scharer house and the second half was spent relaxing under great pressure and stress at my Dad's house. Katie's brother and his fiance are in the states (she's English) and staying with her family and that, plus myself, caused Katie's parents to go wonderfully overboard on the Xmas celebration. I got a ton of gifts, among them a new VCR to play "Crossroads" with Ralph Macchio on. Katie and I got a bunch of new dishes that we picked out to replace my plastic McDonald's plate that shows that carnivorous clown making fun of the monkeys at the zoo. Katie's mom, Debra, got me a gift certificate for the Hatterdashery (HAHA! Such a witty name and I hate saying it!) which was great since I've had my eye on a keen beret for  quite  some time now. Either that or a colorful jester hat that turns from mildly amusing and repugnant to entirely inappropriate within minutes.    THE BIG NEWS:  Andrew and I are writing an 80s movie entitled "Low to the Net" (think "Rocky") about Ping-Pong. We are neck deep in script writing and Andrew is composing the theme song as we speak. (I live my life like a thief in the night!) Our friends Tim and Carrie have a brand-new video camera they are going to let us use and I am ecstatic about that. We'll be able to hook the camera up their new computer and edit footage, dub music and sound-effects, add wipes, and generally make this movie greater than anything this world has ever seen. This is a first for me as all the movies Layne, Chad, and I made in High School featured impromptu scripts and weren't what you'd call plot-heavy. We're taking our time with this project and we'll be able to burn it to DVD, so expect a copy once we're done.   P.S. The cats are doing fantastic. Bojee isn't fat, but she's noticably heavier than Monkey. Monkey drags her favorite toy, a small, plush monkey filled with catnip, around the house in her mouth. She also likes to get into the bathtub or the sink and scratch. I don't know why and I'm thankful she's not looking to take a crap, so it's funny for now.

      Katie and I went to my company's Christmas party last Friday and took full advantage of the free drinks and food, though everything but the liquor was sub-par to last year's party. When everyone believes the economy is doing poorly it's easy for companies to blame anything negative they do on it. We quickly took an empty table situated far from anyone hostage after getting some drinks.   I find the best strategy to take at parties where you don't necessarily like anyone is to form a small group far from everyone else, but still be within their sight. Due to the energy it takes to walk across a large, empty space between people and make small talk with someone you don't care for, this strategy guarantees that only people who honestly want to talk to you will. B  Between being visited by various pleasant satellites, the majority of "social hour" for us was spent with me educating Katie to my opinions of my coworkers.  She was very taken aback by the amount of trophy wives (don't confuse the word "trophy" with "attractive"; what I mean to imply is that they had no jobs besides looking after kids and spending their husband's money) the engineers had. Katie used to work in the design department at Nordstroms and she said all the wives looked like their specific clientele. The jobless women who shop exclusively at the Bon Marche and, to a lesser extent, Nordstroms, are easy to spot. They wear "suits" for women, eye-catching pastel colored clothes, and on their days off they were velvet sweat suits. Usually their hair is cut into a perky bob and their noses are bird-like.   Once the doors to the ballroom (it was more like the home for a cheap wedding) we found a table and branded it as "cool." Jennifer, the graphics design lady, and her husband sat with us as we planned, as well as two semi-normal young female engineers. Dinner was OK and dessert was surprising in it's blandness. It was a chocolate glob that tasted and looked like a dressed-up Hostess Ding Dong. We left after dinner as the dancing started and headed over to Jennifer's house, which is in Fremont and is very nice. Lots of levels and a cute cat named Kevin.

          Katie and I watched a movie on reel-to-reel in anthropology last night that was interesting, but questionable in the viewing's intentions. Abe, our teacher, set the movie up and then left the room for the 40 minutes or so it ran. The above picture is from the Arctic Winter Games; the event is the head pull and the rules look pretty obvious.  I think the only reason the Inuits and other Native Alaskans exist is because their ancestors came across the Bering Strait during summer, thought, "This ain't so bad", and once winter came they were so lost in the frozen wasteland they decided they were stuck so might as well figure out some way not to die. Regardless of how interesting the movie was, I'll be writing a letter about our teacher to whomever. He's taken two weeks off with a sub, around 2 or 3 personal days that he hasn't made up, and besides all of that, is a completley incompetant teacher. Just because you have a Doctorate doesn't mean you know how to teach.  I'm obsessed with  urlLink MAME . I have to have every single game out there, regardless if it's an obscure puzzle game from 1983 that was only released in Japan and is, therefore, completely useless to me since I can't read anything. I'm still ecstatic that I can OWN all of these games for FREE. Many people build or buy  urlLink cabinents  to put their computers inside to have a system that looks like an arcade machine, but can play thousands of games. I implore all of you to go download MAME and a few of the game to witness how cool it is to be playing "Mario Bros." or "Donkey Kong" and have it look, play, and sound EXACTLY like the arcade system. Are you listening Jenny? DONKEY KONG. Give me an email and I'll happily tell you how to set it up.

      Blorch! I spent a good deal of the weekend plugged into my computer downloading games for my arcade emulator. It's almost perfect now and I'll be able to play it off and on for the next couple weeks and then forget about it. Glad that's over with!  Anthropology is almost over and I have uncharacteristically skipped class 2 or 3 times because my time is better off spent at home studying.   I watched the Simpons last night and it was actually funny. Things are looking up!  I also watched SNL and it was a recent rerun with Justin Timberlake as the host and musical guest. Surprisingly, this episode was funny. SNL has sucked for quite a while now and I was very taken aback. Did Loren die? With no fear of losing my heterosexuality I will admit that Justin Timberlake is a talented guy; he's funny and he can sing even if he chooses to sing popjunk.   Britney Spears is a filthy hoe.

Tan Duc...don't go there. We've found some other good soup places that are cheaper, but none that had the selection of Americanized versions. The authentic Vietnamese Pho soups are all about the beef, but I do so miss the fish balls and shrimp cakes.

      I was riding the elevator up to my office's floor this morning while talking to my coworker Gilbert and there was a very fat man in front of us who was breathing like he was having a heart attack. When we got off the elevator I commented on his wheezing with an audio recreation of his performance. The bike courier with a hook for a hand behind us had gotten off as well to pick something up and as we were walking to our office said, "You shouldn't make fun of people just because they're fat." I only partially heard him at first so I turned around and met his hard stare, which was a little uncomfortable.   To clarify, I wasn't making fun of him because he was fat. I didn't say, "Get a load of that fat guy. What a fatty." I was making fun of the fact that he sounded like he was breathing through a stir straw. Now, while that might be related to his weight, as perhaps the trek up Seattle's hilly downtown winded him, I won't refrain from commenting on anything because it might be related to something unfortante in a person's life. Hear that hook? Mind your own business. The guy thinks he's a hero for the underdogs because he's got a hook for a hand. Needless to say I'll still uncomfortably avoid eye contact with him till I forget about the whole thing.   ALBINISM   Are you looking for Albino information?

      I skipped Monday's post due to construction underway in the office I work in. We take up 1 and 1/2 floors and are displacing a 1/3 of our staff to another floor as that empty section is remodeled, so right now I've lost my most convenient spot to access the internet. I'm doubtful as the how much of the area I work in will be renovated. I've got a high desk and though everyone else is getting a fancy new chair, I'm skeptical as to how much money will be spent to update my area.    Malachi: The last of the minor prophets, and the writer of the last book of the Old Testament.   urlLink Patrick Park  is tomorrow! We'll be seeing him at the  urlLink Crocodile Cafe  and he'll be accompanied by a full band, as opposed to the two solo shows Katie and I have seen him play.  Over the weekend, Katie, Andrew, and I shot a short movie revolving around vague, dramatic scenes spliced together out of order. It was a lot of fun shooting it, but I think I'm enjoying editing it even more! I'm using  urlLink Adobe Premiere  and it's proving to be extremely versatile as well as intuitive. It's hugely satisfying to soundtrack a movie. Unfortunately, this particular movie isn't suitable for exciting public-access style wipes, but there's always time.  I'm taking two night classes at  urlLink NSCC  and am debating whether or not to continue. I'd been taking only one class a quarter before, but decided to try two since Katie had taken this particular instructor before and said he wasn't hard. Two class a quarter year-round amounts to going to school on a full-time basis and that is exciting, but worries me that I'll be so stressed/swamped that I'll hurt my GPA, which has survived pristinely so far.  Katie and I watched an episode of "Mad About You" last night that revolved an apartment of Paul's he was subletting and planned to give up, but the funny thing was the apartment was Kramer's apartment from "Seinfeld". Same set and everything. Kramer did his usual bit and gave him some advice, then they snuck in a crack about Jerry submitting a pilot to NBC. How the hell did "Mad About You" jump-start Helen Hunt's career and not Paul Reiser? He's hilarious and she's a nasty old bag! Plyus, she can't act worth a hill of beans. Ever see "Pay It Forward"? LORD. But, she can't be blamed for that entire movie. That entire film was revolting. Ever since "American Beauty" Kevin Spacey has done terrible movies. Check out "Swimming with Sharks" for a good early movie featuring him.

      My mistake,  urlLink "Lollipop Girls in Hard Candy"  in 3-D is playing, not "Disco Dolls." Sadly, the former did not get a stellar review. One article on the movie described it as so absurd I thought I'd HAVE to go, but the link above proves it's not coherent enough to warrent spending money on. Too bad.

          Oh.  My. God.  I thought seeing "Revenge of the Cheerleaders" was youthful, ironic humor at it's best, but I was wrong. The Egyptian Theater is showing "Disco Dolls", a classic 70s porn movie, in 3-D. That is amazing. I feel like I have to go, but seeing porn on a big screen with other people breaks all my etiquette regarding the viewing or pornographic movies. It'll take some effort on my part not to cringe uncomfortably. It's why I've never, and most likely never will, go to a strip club. I'd be much to uncomfortable to enjoy it. Naked girls I have nothing against. But, do I want to see them while sitting next to guffawing, sweaty frat boys and tobacco-stained geezers? Nooooo sir. Plus, from what I know, the average stripper isn't what I'd call attractive. And dancing naked on a stage? Weird. Just plain weird sir.

      The "gang" and I are going to see "Tron" at the Grand Illusion theatre in the U this weekend. They show oddball movies in their late slot at 11pm and if they continue their track record, I'll be going more often. It's where we saw "Revenge of the Cheerleaders", which was an absolute success.   The brainless, liberal hippies in my History class are getting too uninhibited. Our teacher is liberal and allows their pointless rantings, but I end up feeling completely stifled by their overwhelmingly pointless observations. We were discussing Bush amending the constitution to state marriage can only exist between a man and a women and the two fashion-conscious, giggly girls across the room collectively asked "what the issues were at the time when the constitution was wrote that made them so close-minded". Then, the girl next to me with the much-to-long, wavy red hair (the one who makes her own soap) declared that "Christians are so hypocritical. They preach forgiveness and charity, but then don't follow through and like...", and as the class went silent she trailed off. It's so revolting to have a room full of empty-headed, liberal college kids. We didn't even have one person who was offended at the girl's condemning statement about Christians and that fact offended ME. I'm going to start speaking up about this stuff. I usually argue with people even if it's only for fun, so I might as well learn how to argue like a Republican.  Later we were discussing  the middle-east and the U.S.'s reliance on the massive amounts of oil there and one of the trendy duo across the room said, "like, I'm sure the car makers have some sort of, like, deal with the gas companies," in regards to why America drives one big, gas-sucking SUV. I was forced to loudly defend our well-meaning auto industry's intentions by yelling an astounded "NO!", and then again when she enthusiastically nodded her head to convince me that such a deal might in fact exist. I'm not sure whether my teacher likes me or not because that was the first time I opened my mouth in class. Later in that same class I asked him the reason the U.S. bombed the Dresden, Germany during WWII, but I'm held back from vocalizing myself for fear of associating my voice with such a huge pile of idiotic statements. By the end of the class I'll be viewed as "that retarded conservative guy" in the back.

          NEW DIET CRAZE TAKES A BYTE OUT OF WEIGHT-LOSS!    The new weight-loss fad sweeping America's thighs is DataDiet.   "It's a brand-new way to lose weight that specifically targets America's tech-culture," says founder Gil Merkin. "Everyone uses computers and gadgets these days, so I thought it would be a great idea to combine weight-loss and some sort of computer-thingy. So, I invented DataDiet."  After an introductory fee of $899.50, which comes with a $150 mail-in rebate, a DataDiet customer receives a 30-minute counseling session with a DataDiet representative, a DataDiet Food Cartridge, and a enthusiastic pamphlet. The Food Cartridge is compatible with a wide variety of home printers and prints out your meals on a personally tailored daily schedule.   The "ink" is composed of soy, glue, Mexican Elk taint shavings (which contain amazing metabolic properties), and butter. The cartridges come in three exciting flavors, "MegaByte", "Hi-Speed Satisfaction", and the perplexing "0111011011". Normal printer paper works with your diet and is perfectly edible, though the DataDiet brand printer paper is "low-carb, low-fat, and high-energy!" At breakfast, lunch, and dinner, a DataDiet SuperCustomer is treated to an edible meal straight from their computer.   "For a small fee, DataDiet customers can also receive our 'Deluxe Literary Classics Package'," says Gil. "Everyday you'll receive one page of a classic novel and over a month of dieting, you'll not only have gotten thinner, but you'll have a read 'God It's Me, Margaret", or any of your personal selection from our vast library of Judy Blume novels." Gil added, "I'm wildly succesful."

      My "Geopolitics of the Middle-East" professor is turning out to be a mixed-bag. Initially I was excited when he burst into the room on the first day of class and was enthusiastic and animated, fearing for another dead weight teacher like my Anthropology instructor, but Mr. Haertle has shown he balances his classroom exuberance with inept orginizational skills. True, he's ancient and has had a heart attack within the last few years, and he is teaching at a community college, which I'm only now starting to appreciate as a sub-standard matriculation. But after Anthropology I'm got little patience for bumbling professors. Haertle's lectures are fantastic and I'm thankful for that. It's helped a lot with a class based around Geography, a subject I'm not great at. I guess I'll consider myself lucky he's a good teacher when he's got things together.   I'm taking time-lapse photography of our cats with my camcorder while I'm at work. It's a fun function and I hope I get to catch them in a emberassing shot, but I did it last night and they didn't do much. After this I'm going to record the growth of one of our bamboo shoots and after that, I think a piece of bread slowly molding.   Katie and I are planning a trip to San Francisco in the summer. We previously were going to England for her brother's wedding, but that might not be happening for a while, and we've already been to Canada, so CA was the closest besides Iowa which I'm sure everyone can agree isn't a place for pilgrimage.

      I've been informed  urlLink Jonathan Brandis  was only in "The NeverEnding Story: Deuce X - The Return" and therefore, should not be mourned.  I took my new camcorder for a test run on Friday night and it perfomed beautifully, entertaining the entire living room with wipes and incredible local-access-level special effects displayed on the TV. On Saturday I was terribly sick and was emulating a puking person throughout most of the day, though I only ejected my stomach contents twice.   For anyone in the area's supported by  urlLink Craig's List , check it out. It's a great place to locally buy or sell stuff.  I've decided I'll vote wholeheartedly for Howard Dean in he gets nominated. If Kerry is, I'll vote less enthusiastically. They both are very similar in their beliefs, but Dean is so much more ballsy. Kerry has been in Washington politics for so long he's learned when to be wishy-washy and when to show some opinion and I'd like to finally see a liberal president not afraid to clearly state that Republicans are just awful. Just awful.   I recently discovered I've never read "Hocus Pocus" by  urlLink Kurt Vonnegut ! I tried to read it when I was younger, but the patched together format of it's creation confused me and I stopped reading after a chapter or so. Katie and I watched "Slaughterhouse Five" on Sunday and we both enjoyed it. I had seen it before and though it was still good the second time around.

      Do you remember the old gnome guy from "The NeverEnding Story"? The cackling inventor who showed Atreyu the sphixes and helped him to pass through their killer eye beams? That is EXACTLY what my "Geopolitics of the Middle East" professor sounds like. It would get old less quickly if every class he didn't mess up his powerpoint presentation and make jokes while ineptly trying to work that confangled machine.   Also, the actor who played Atreyu,  urlLink Jonathan Brandis , has killed himself.

          I propose that colleges ask for political affiliation information when registering students. The classroom experience would be more enjoyable with an equal blend of liberal and conservative beliefs, rather than whoever signed up all willy-nilly.   My American History class is taught by a great instructor who is mostly liberal and I enjoy that. I am mostly liberal. But, most of the class appears to be extremely liberal and not too reluctant to open their collective mouths at any opportunity. Of course, there are always a few rotten stumps that give everyone else a bad name, such as the fashionable girl who says "like" often and usually ends her sentence by trailing off vaguely. The girl who sits at next to me letting everyone know that many household products use animal byproducts or that corporations are "really bad."   I admire people who are passionate about causes. Most people today are too cynical to fight for things they believe in for fear of being branded unrealistic. There is nothing more uncool than believing in something that gives off a whiff of Hippy. But young people need to understand that just because they have only now found out that the meat industry is an ugly, cruel thing, or that the US is a corrupt corporate womb, doesn't mean it's news to everyone else. And it doesn't mean we all care either. Perhaps we should, but the fact is, most people don't concern themselves with it even though they have been presented enough information to make a moral choice on their own. College Kid Syndrome. It's nasty. These things have been shouted from every corner by smelly, unkempt activists for a while now, and if you want to be effective in fighting for you cause, as opposed to merely trying to impress people with your knowledge of how bad America is, come up with a new argument that might interest people more than regurgitate picket signs.

      We finally saw "21 Grams" over the weekend, even though we almost did the exact same thing we did last time which was get their late and the show was almost sold out. It was all my fault this second time, but luckily there were enough seats.  After a mildly confusing period during the beginning where you try to figure out what is going on (three characters lives are shot seperate and spliced together into brief clips with no chronologically order) and it is left to you to figure out what's going on and how these three people relate to each other. It's easy to guess halfway through, but there are still a few blank areas to figure out. The movie has gotten a lot of great reviews and word-of-mouth recommondation, but overall it was only good. What bothered me was the way they ended the movie. It's very dark and has a lot of death, tragedy, and screwed up characters in it, but it's never resolved. Sean Penn gives a lame monologue at the end of the movie and that's all. It doesn't explain anything. It's a poetic attempt at making sense of all the chaos throughout the movie, but they would have been better off shortening his monologue or cutting it alltogther.  I can't WAIT for my video camera! Actually, I can and am. But, I downloaded a copy of "Adobe Premiere" which is Adobe's video editing program (I didn't know they had one) and it's fantastic. It's a little technical since it's an industry standard, but after a few hours of going throught the tutorial, I figured it out. There are so many options for wipes, fades, and tons of other effects, as well as being able to edit the audio, fade it out, and dub music or sound effects. "Low to the Net" is going to amazing.   Our cats, Bojee and Monkey, are getting weird. Monkey scratches strange things like the bathtub, sink, the corners of walls, and the bathroom mirror. Bojee is very bi-polar and is nice if you can catch her. Once she's being petted she's very friendly, but otherwise she's skittish. We were tv/videogame-fried by the end of last night, so I entertained myself by tying plastic bags around Monkey's midsection as well as wrapping her up in blankets and watching her try to get out. Monkey loves it all strangely enough. When Katie put her in our cat carrier and was driving her to the vet, Monkey was purring the whole way.  We bought the 2nd volume of DVDs of the show "Mad About You" a while back and they're great. I loved the show when it was on and it's still good. We've watched all the episodes and I've sold it on Ebay so I can buy the 1st volume.  Go  urlLink here  to download ANYthing. Games, movies, comics, applications, music. It's great. It's a peer-to-peer thing and you need to download a small program that let's you download them, but it works great and ALL the links are good, as opposed to Kazaa and Imesh which you'll be lucky to find a good link out of thirty.

      WAH: That'll be twelve dollars. CUSTOMER: But...I only had a cup of coffee. WAH: Six dollars. CUSTOMER: There's no way a cup of coffee costs six dollars! WAH: Thousand dollars. CUSTOMER: What?! WAH: Fine! I pay! But you get out! CUSTOMER: FINE!   WAH: Come again! CUSTOMER: What? WAH: GET OUT!!!!   "Low to the Net" is still alive, no thanks to my attention span and work ethic. I'm not sure what Mr.Fouts has been working on, but I'm still writing scenes for our hilarious bastard-child of the 80s. We worked on the sad version of the "Low to the Net" song a week or so ago and it is quite rockin'. Email me any suggestions for the soundtrack.   I'm taking two night classes this quarter, one is about the history of America from 1865 to present, and the other is "Geopolitics of the Mideast". Katie has taken a class with my history teacher and said he was a great instructor and wasn't too hard, which is what pushed me to take two classes, figuring I could handle the load. Katie is taking Geopolitics with me and we had our first class yesterday. Our teacher is a stooped, 70 year old Arizonian who is beyond animated and very sharp. His class doesn't sound like it'll be very hard, test and homework-wise, so I'm very pleased with my scholarly plate. It's four days a week, 6:00pm to 8:30pm, and that is proving to be a little taxing, but I'm a real tough guy.  I haven't heard from Derek in quite a while. He said he had accidentally broken his new keyboard and couldn't afford to get a new one and that was why he had dissapeared from my radah. Yeah.....right. And I have a disease that dulls my nerves to the extent that I can't feel pain.

          I've done it. After hours of brain-sqoozing headaches enjoyed in front of the computer, I've ordered my video camera. It took a lot of frustrating online research to figure out what works with what, what model to get and why, and how much I was willing to spend, but I've settled on a similar model to one my friends own. I'm proud I never broke down and bought the first thing in a store that looked good and plus, I saved a LOT of money doing everything over the internet. The camera I bought was selling for $800 dollars in some places! I got it for hundreds less. Millions.  I've been re-reading Vonnegut lately and still find his writing style and format interesting, though "so it goes" can only go so far. Listen: My unhealthy use of the public library was broken by my brother Tor sending me some books for my birthday, so after reading those I started reading "Slaughterhouse 5", which I own on paperback. "Schlachthaus fünf" and "Mother Night" are the only good Vonnegut movies. Actually, I think there is only one other, "Breakfast of Champions." That movie was so bad only a sheep could strangle my dissapointment out of that word. Such a good book too.   I've taken to drinking Martinis and I rather like it. I always thought they were very sophisticated and grown-up and it turns out they are! I wear a monacle now and go by, "Lord Merryweather," not to be confused with the midget wrestler.  I wrote a letter to the head of the Social Sciences department at North Seattle Community College about my Anthropolgy teacher, Dr. Omara Abe Benjamin. Abe has been there for decades and I'm sure my letter won't do a thing, but over the years I've learning complaining is cumulative and can be very effective. Most people don't bother because they feel it's a useless frustration, but I've come to enjoy it after being screwed by companies and people in various ways.   I bought "SSX 3" for my PS2 and it's wonderful. Real hip. I hear the new "Amped" snowboarding game for the Xbox is for filthy street urchins with no class at all.   "I Believe In a Thing Called Love" by The Darkness has been stuck in my head for the last week.   I did some research on the film I saw last weekend, "Revenge of the Cheerleaders", and it turns out one of the leading ladies,  urlLink Cheryl "Rainbeaux" Smith , was a bit of a cult b-movie star. It's too bad her rockstar boyfriend got her pregnant, addicted to heroin, and then let her become homeless and die from hepatitis. I'm serious.

      Flibberdigibbit! It is hard to pick which video camera to purchase, if you're an intelligent shopper like myself. I finally decided on the  urlLink Sony something or other . It's a chunk of change, but well worth it I feel.   I bought a digital camera a while back and love it. I've been able to document my crazy, twirly-swirly adventures and it's great to be able to look through them. I feel a video camera will be push the documentation of my hilarious life one step further...into the "danger zone", if you will. Plus, besides annoying everyone who think they are gorgeous, but want to be humble as well and so feign a reluctance to being captured on video, I can now film "Low to the Net" with impunity. I was going to use my friend Tim's camera, which is very similar to the one I'm buying, but I wouldn't be able to use it whenever I like and I wouldn't be able to get the extremem shots that require the camera to be submerged in a block of Jello which would then be lowered very quickly (fall) from a great height by a bungee cord off a building. The "BunJello" shot I call it.   I'll be getting the camera for much cheaper than is listed on that page, but of course you always need all the accesories to get your purchase working well, such as a better battery, a carrying case, a tripod, and all that horse manure. Plus, I'm going to sell my CDRW drive for one that can burn DVDs because there is no point to buy a digital camera  and NOT being able to play with the video on a computer and burn personal DVDs. I'm SO excited my liver just quivered.

      You haven't lived till you've whipped a goat to death. This one time, the goat tried to eat himself to end his terror.   The filming of "Beedrock Inc" went over smashingly! Even though the cast consisted of Andrew, Katie, Tim, Carrie, Travis, Donnie, and myself we actually got the whole thing done in one night. Usually filming takes forever due to everyone's tomfoolery, which always increases exponentially in relation to the number of people involved. I'm hoping I can finish editing "Jerry's Ghost is Spooky" and "Beedrock Inc." tomorrow.

           ABE BENJAMIN:  Ex-Nigerian Warlord or Bad Teacher? BOTH.   NOTE: This picture is dated. Now, he has less hair and is much less ethnic looking in dress. Plus, he has the  urlLink Devil's  genetalia within his mouth.    I tried to find a picture of my current academic goblin,  urlLink Mr.Haertle , but he's nowhere to be found. Maybe he's a GHOST!!!   I have brought shame upon the Kristensen name. I'm doing terribly in my Geopolitcs class. My two quiz scores have been in the D-F range and I see no possiblity of improvment. Mr.Haertle is so disorganized that I have no idea what quizzes will be on, so I'm forced to spend an hour or so five days a week studying everything he gives us as far as course packets. I studied my ass off for this last test and got a bad grade anyways, so I'm not worrying. I'm doing my best, but his matriculatory ineptness is too powerful. He's giving us the option to write what he calls a "flyswatter" paper. A previous student of his who was failing the class wrote him a short essay that supposedly demonstrated that he indeed DID learn something in the class, even if he didn't test well, but Mr.Haertle wrote his two or three paragraph paper and all it was was a kiss-ass last attempt at not failing. And, or course, Mr.Haertle gave him a 4.0 for such good work. This man is a bastard.

      Katie and I's transfer to Seattle Central Community College didn't go over. We went there on Tuesday and the registration/administration employee's were total jackasses, though I can understand their bruskness; if I had to deal with a bunch of know-it-all teenagers who can't follow instructions all day, I'd be a  stupid dick with a bad mustache  too. But, the main reason we didn't transfer is Central hardly has any night classes! Probably because most of the people on Capitol Hill are young kids who have money and take school during the day. It's no big deal. We'll be taking one online class so that will cut down on wasted classtime with bad teachers, plus I wouldn't like going to Central anyways. I've never liked Capitol Hill and I think if I had to go up there every week I'd have an aneurysm from having to deal with the Hillites. It's such a lame scene up there and it always has been.   I still haven't found out how I did on my two big tests. I know I aced the History test, though I don't have the results to prove it. My teacher gives you a surplus of multiple-choice problems and it's up to you to know them. Only a fraction are actually on the test, so it's only a matter of knowing/memorizing them all. I'm pretty sure I did well on my Geopolitics test; I went over it a second time before turning it and scrutinized every answer and ended up fixing some mistakes I made. Usually when I go back over a test and change answers, it's for the worse, but not this time! NOT THIS TIME!!!   Next Up:  A hilarious sitcom called, " Boomer and Beedrock ". It's an "Odd Couples" style roommate show starring  Beedrock, the half-man half-praying mantis , and Boomer, a dumb jock who likes football and DOESN'T like finding eggs in his laundry.    "BEEDROCK! Get back here!!"  "SQQQWWARRRK!!!"   Actually, I don't know how praying mantises procreate, but I'll assume it's either through laying eggs or implanting larvae within a mammals chest.   Anybody seen the movie " urlLink Monster "? Katie and I agreed to turn it off once Charlize Theron was being violated with a tire-iron by a redneck who had picked her up off the road and paid her $30 for sex. I'm going back for more though! I can handle it.

           "Oh Beedrock! Your milady awaits...SQQQUUAAAAARRRRRRK!"   Katie and I are down here at the Kristensen compound in Portland, OR with my Dad and his wife Evelyn. After getting into town we went to "Wu's Open Kitchen", which was certainly no "Wah's", but still. We got home after sitting around talking for a while, retired to bed. I tried to play my new crappy PS2 game, but it was crappy, so I stopped. It's up on  urlLink Ebay  now, so go buy it!  In other news, politicians find all these gay marriages  urlLink "vexing".  Personally, they titillate more than vex.

      Oh YEAH! The head tech guy at my work has somewhere around 100 gigs of music (to you people out there who refer to computers as "tv typers", that's a lot of songs) on a network at my job and he just gave me access to it. To boot, only a month ago my computer didn't even have a sound card in it, which meant the only way I could listen to music was to hook speakers to the headphone jack of the CD drive, put a CD in, and manually start it with the "play" button. But now, I can listen to hours of music on a random playlist and it's so satisfying.   Katie and I skipped out on class yesterday after we took our Geopolitics class. We gain little from his lectures in terms of what we need to know for testing and we weren't in the mood to listen to his inane, but education babblings after taking that exam.  I've been researching small claims court lately because I've been preparing for the chance that I'd have to take Layne there to reclaim the money he owes me. I've been calling his house and leaving messages for the last 2 weeks and he hasn't been calling me back, so I called his place on Thursday and left a message with Sharon telling Layne that, "if he doesn't call me back I have to assume he's not planning on paying me and I will take other actions to get my money back." Layne called yesterday angry about why I called "threatening" him through Sharon and I explained that I've been leaving messages for the last 2 weeks, but he said he knew nothing about that.   I realized when I called the weekend before last and spent 20 minutes talking to Sharon for the first time in months, I had told her to tell Layne I called, but...I forgot she had told ME to not tell Layne or Susan that we had spoken because she can't let them know that she speaks with "the enemy". It is hilarious because last night as Layne was telling me how dumb it was to be overeating Sharon yelled in the background, "Yeah, it was STUPID!" But it's actually her fault this happened because she can't stand up to her roommates or for herself. She obviously didn't give Layne my message because she's too scared of Layne and, much more accurately, Susan finding out she actually had a nice conversation with me.   Susan has been emotionally bullying Sharon from the moment she moved in with her and it's really unfortunate Sharon hasn't had the sense to get out of that house. As I've said in a previous post, there was nothing more Sharon wanted to be rid of Susan, but as time passed she slowly resigned herself to being pushed around by Susan and now she's stuck. It's too bad because Sharon is a great person and doesn't deserve that kind of treatment. Anyways,  Layne said that he'll be able to pay me back in full by the end of next month  and I've absolutely salivating at the possibility of not having to think about that household anymore.  I'm pretty sure Derek is in jail. Unless someone murdered him or something.  Also,  "Take On Me",  by  A-HA  and  "I Want You To Want Me" , by  Cheap Trick  are two great songs. Hardly anyone would argue the latter, but I suppose many would the former. I would have to admit there are covers of "Take On Me" that are much better than the original. That seems sad, but it's all tastes. There are loads of songs from the 80s that I like covers of, but not the original, and that's only because I don't like the way bands in the 80s were produced. Hokay?   A rule of thumb:  If you find yourself whispering when talking about people who are a different race than you, you're racist.

      I did fabulously on my History midterm, but I'd be ashamed if I didn't. The teacher gives out sheets of multiple-choice questions totalling around 80 and half of them, in their exact form, will be on the midterm. So, he basically gives you the test. All you have to do is, if you're an idiot, memorize the answers and questions, or actually study the material and read the text-book. Then, it takes little effort to familiarize yourself with the test.   Our Geopolitics test is today and I'm done studying. I've been killing myself for the last two weeks reading all the material we've been given because he's extremely bad at letting us know what we the test will be on. I'm fairly cetain the teacher hates me as well. Most people in that class are infatuated with his nutty-proffessor absent-mindedness and cacklings. He gives great lectures, so it can be funny when he yells or misplaces something, but when it affects my grade, I'm not so keen on it. Nobody else seems to have a huge problem with it, but I won't be getting a bad grade because he's senile.   What is the deal with  urlLink The Darkness ? Their single is great, but the rest of the album is pretty middle-of-the-road. They're more gimmick than talent, but they've blown up everywhere but in the US.

       I can't stop thinking about  urlLink the Saxons .   I'm almost ready to take down my History Midterm! OH YEAH! I'm gonna MOLEST that sucker!  I'm slightly less ready for my Geopolitics of the Middle East midterm. Allright. Let's go. I'll do this up right.  Does anyone shave their cats? Monkey's belly has been hairless for a couple weeks since she was spayed and I think it's great. I might just shave some shapes or rougish designs into her back. Perhaps an arrorw or exclamation mark! Such ribaldry!  Katherine Lee is a whiny ass.

      The filming for "Jerry's Ghost is Spooky" is complete and I'll have the editing done by...sometime. This weekend Katie and going to my Dad's house in Portland and school takes up most of the work week. We also completed a short film entitled, "Beedrock the Praying Mantis-Man's Torturous Passion for Song".   Soup! Pho Soup! You are glorious indeed! The majestic spoonery of your seasonings send my tastebuds swooning! Verily.  By they way, "verily" is equivilant to saying "word". For example: "Yo man, that turkey is dope as HELL!" "WORD!" I'll be working the lingo onto the streets over the next couple months, so expect to see some great rappers emerge in the next year who use words like, "broadsword", "doth", and "wench".

      Anyone ever heard of " The Shocker "? It's an extraordinary sex activity. It involves, after a half-hour of furious bedroom acrobatics, telling your partner you hate Black people.

      Haha. Actually, I have no idea if Derek dropped out of school or not. I was only attempting to provoke him into emailing me. He abruptly stopped communication with me shortly before our blog-story ended, which was just as well. I'd be inclined to say he's been arrested, but I'd also be inclined to say he was offended in some way by something I did, perhaps in regards to his writing, and has boycotted me. It's all the same to me, but I sure would like to know what the deal is! Not enough to actually email him though.  "Hooves!? You be mistaken! *snort* These be but common worksman boots. Look again mortal!!"  Why frogs!? Why. My favorite animals is the Furiously masturbating South-American armadillo. And cows. I buy EVERYthing that is cow related!!!  I've home sick by the way.   I've pouring through my mp3s and trying to burn some CDs for work. Right now I'm checking out 20 different Pixies albums, EPs, singles, b-sides, and bootlegs that I downloaded with BitTorrent. I don't like them much, besides their "Doolittle" album, which I'm sure will enrage all the Pixies dorks out there. A while ago Katie and I saw a great Pixies cover band called "No.13 Baby" and they were great! They played mostly off of "Doolittle" as well.

       urlLink Kurt Vonnegut  has been a favorite author of mine for a long time, in fact, the only writer I've cared to distinguish for quite a while. It's not that I don't enjoy most books, but for some reason, the majority of novels don't interest me enough to warrant hunting down the authors other work. I've read a great deal in the last year as I've taken to reading a book a week and have found a couple authors that I've enjoyed enough to remember, for instance,  urlLink Jonathan Franzen . The exceptions are the classics, such as Steinbeck. This all is surely a product of my technique for finding books: I run to the public library on my fifteen minute break and grab books at random, fast enough so as to get back to work on-time. Strangely enough, I've only found about three books that were unreadable. The rest were enjoyable enough for me to finish!  Here is a quote from "God Bless You, Mr.Rosewater," by Kurt Vonnegut, that has stuck in my memory since High School. Eliot Rosewater has exited the bathtub in his one room apartment as his ultra-conservative father, a United States Senator that has recently passed a bill outlawing "obscene material", uncomfortably walks around examining objects and waiting for Eliot to get dressed. Eliot's phone has rung and he answers it naked, absolutely oblivious to the horror his estranged father is going through.   "Eliot had now found a [pubic hair] that was a lulu. He kept extending and extending it until it was revealed as being one foot long. He looked down at it, then glanced at his father, incredulously proud of owning such a thing."

       DEREK CHIVERS UPDATE:  I recently heard through the grapevine that Derek has dropped out of college, which is a bummer. I know he had aspirations to become a teacher or writer or something, but I guess he’s got other plans.   Andrew has started an  urlLink “I Love Alf!” blog fan-site . Go check it out.  I’ve found supporters of President Bush rarely have concrete reasons why they support him. They usually “just think he’s done a good job,” or if they do have specific reasons, they are usually false or terribly misconstrued. My coworker said America was looking at the glass half-empty and that “interest rates are lower than they’ve been in decades”. I guess he forgot the reason interest rates were lowered was to stop the nation-wide recession. Regardless, nothing will sway Bush-supporters; they’re like devout Christians. Regardless of the facts, logic, and reasonable thought, they stick to their guns.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  GEORGE W. BUSH - RESUME  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20520   EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE:   Law Enforcement:  I was arrested in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1976 for driving under the  influence of alcohol. I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's  license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been "lost" and  is not available.   Military:  I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a  drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas  Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.   College:  I graduated from Yale University with a low C average.  I was a cheerleader.   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:  *   I ran for U.S. Congress and lost.  *   I began my career in the oil business in Midland, Texas, in 1975.  *   I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas. The company  went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock.  *   I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took  land  using taxpayer money.  *   With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry  (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS:  *    I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making  Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston  replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America.  *    I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions  in borrowed money.  *    I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American  history.  *    With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's  appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over  500,000 votes.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:  *    I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a  criminal record.  *    I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one  billion dollars per week.  *    I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.  *    I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.  *    I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any  12-month period.  *    I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.  *    I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the  U.S. stock market. In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost  their jobs and that trend continues every month.  *    I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any  administration in U.S. history. My "poorest millionaire," Condoleeza Rice,  has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.  *    I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S.  President.  *    I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most  corporate campaign donations.  *    My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends,  Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S.  History, Enron.  *    My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to  assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.  *    I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against  investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating  the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the  biggest corporate rip- offs in history.  *    I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused  to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. I  presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.  *    I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded  government contracts.  *    I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than  any President in U.S. history.  *    I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in  the history of the United States government.  *    I've broken more international treaties than any President  in U.S. history.  *    I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations  remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.  *    I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.  *    I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. "prisoners of war"  detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.  *    I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election  inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).  *    I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any  President since the advent of television.  *    I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year  period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the  worst security failure in U.S. history.  *    I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center  attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in  the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.  *    I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to  simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering  the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.  *    I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked,  pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did  so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens,  and the world community.  *    I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in  duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in wartime.  *    In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for  attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends.  *    I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans  (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.  *    I am supporting development of a nuclear "Tactical Bunker Buster," a  WMD.  *    I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden  [sic] to justice.   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:  *    All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my  father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view.  *    All records of SEC investigations into my insider trading and my  bankrupt companies are sealed in secrecy and unavailable for public view.  *    All records or minutes from meetings that I, or my Vice-President,  attended regarding public energy policy are sealed in secrecy and  unavailable for public review.   -PLEASE CONSIDER MY EXPERIENCE WHEN VOTING IN 2004. -PLEASE SEND THIS TO  EVERY VOTER YOU KNOW.

      Holy Shazbot.  Here are some nutrition facts for  1 serving  of  Top Ramen :   11% Total Fat 16% Saturated Fat 20% Sodium   I've only today realized that  one package of Top Ramen contains 2 servings !   I used to eat 3 packages of Top Ramen every single work day for around 2 years!  That is 6 servings a day OR in nutritional terms:   66% Total Fat 96% Saturated Fat 120% Sodium   But, I'll consider myself lucky that I haven't gotten addicted to the salty prodigousness of  urlLink Saltidos !

          Kylie says, "All the makeup and lighting hides the fact that I'm actually a horse!"   What is the DEAL! I just ripped my coworker Gilbert a new one because he trys to pretend that Kylie Minogue is a talented artist. She's a glamour monkey! They paint her and tie the strings to her appendages and she flops around the stage lifting her skirt. How does it take THREE people to write these lyrics:   Rushing up on you like a freak in the fast lane,  I'm on a mission to whip you into a hurricane,  And when I overtake I'm gonna be in pole position,  Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Are you ready for the change,  If I let you stay, If I let you play,  Will you lose or win, You can't kiss and tell,  Will you pass it or fail, Let the games begin   Wow! And that is ALL she does. She writes a third of the lryics. She has nothing to do with the music or ANYthing else. She probably gets credit for some part of the stage show, but I'm sure she bullied the costume or set designer with her ideas till they caved in and she got partial credit. UCK.   I can deal with her being a vapid, talentless pop star. She's not the first by a long shot, but a prerequisite for her kind is attractiveness and she only mildly so and that's with makeup on! Lord.

      The Sounds! They’re playing at Graceland on the ...7th? I can never remember dates or names. I haven’t gone to see many shows lately and the Sounds are pretty rockin’, so I think I will. The Sounds’ lead singer looks like she’d be smoking Camel Straights in a bowling alley. She sounds great, but lord.   I’m finding a good naturopathic doctor in the downtown area that is covered by my insurance. After seeing conventional doctors for a few years regarding my throat, I’ve concluded that the American medical system is terribly mismanaged. I won’t say some absurd generalization like, “Doctors are screwed up, dude,” but I think that our system has seriously skewed good doctor’s practices. They are little more than employees of the insurance companies, as well as human lube shops. They get you in and out as quickly as possibly while addressing your concerns in the most minimalistic way. I’ve practically been kicked out of doctor’s offices when I wanted to talk about other issues than the one major issue I stated when I made the appointment.   I’ve been going to the Tahoma Clinic which is a nationally praised Naturopathic clinic and it’s a big difference in the time they spend with you, how much the doctors actually care about your problems and the best way to solve them. Unfortunately, they are in Renton and aren’t covered by my insurance anymore, so I have to find one under contract with my insurance. That makes me very nervous, as the Tahoma Clinic bills the patient directly and the patient is reimbursed by their insurance if they are covered. They do this to keep as much distance from the insurance companies as possible and, while inconvenient for people who are used to paying $15-25 dollars a pop for a normal doctor, I think it’s a good solution.    Katie’s sick. She stayed home from work yesterday and had a horribly sore throat this morning.   On a more ridiculous note, I had an absolutely absurd encounter with Susan, Layne’s popular girlfriend, last night at North Seattle Community College. I stopped in the café to get some coffee and was having a conversation with the baristo (male?) about G.I. Joe. I ordered my drip and walked to the other end of the bar to wait for my drink when I saw that someone had left their punch card on the table. I asked the guy whose it was and he said it was the girl’s behind me, so I grabbed the card and swirled around to find the girl was, GASP...Susan! Lovely! She ignored the fact that I had looked at her because she had obviously seen me when I walked in, so she tried to look very interested in her book. I quickly reversed my spin and set the card back down on the counter hoping to avoid any extensive contact with such an amiable person. The baristo said I should just take the card, but I suggested that it’d be dishonest. He said I could ask her for it and I insisted I’d rather not. Unfortunately, Susan was waiting for her drink and the guy served it up. She walked up, took the drink after taking a meaningful look at me, and then, to the coffee guy, said this loudly: “It’s ok. He’s GOOD at taking things that don’t belong to him.”   She turned around and left as the coffee guy and I shared a bewildered look. Had she mistaken the college cafe for a movie set? I suppose it could have been a poignant moment for at least one of the parties involved if her dramatically delivered barb made any sense. I took something? Was she referring to the $700 dollars her boyfriend owes me?   It’s bothersome to me that someone who is barely on my radar can have such angry feelings towards me. I’m not sure what she could have against me anyways. The only way we are relevant to each other is that I used to date her friend and roommate Sharon and that her boyfriend used to be my best friend. I wouldn’t be surprised if she held my relationship with Sharon against me, as if I mistreated Sharon, which I didn’t. The only bad thing about our relationship was that we broke up more than once because we were both reluctant to let go and that was painful for Sharon. All I heard about for the last half of my relationship with Sharon was how much she hated Susan and how much she wanted to stop being her roommate because she was a bad person who sucked the life out of her and made her feel bad all the time. Those are all Sharon’s words. The only time I ever saw her uncontrollably upset was when she was talking about Susan.   And, in regards to Layne, it’s unfortunate our friendship had to end in such a cliché way, but...”these things happen”. People grow apart. It would have happened soon enough anyways. It’s too bad it happened the way it did, but what can you do? The money Layne owes me has nothing to do with her and he has agreed to pay me back, so she shouldn’t feel angry about that. I know she just doesn’t LIKE me, probably because when she and Layne first got together it was about the time he and I started having problems with our friendship, so she probably thinks I treated him badly or something. When Layne announced he was moving out of the house we were renting 3 months after we moved in I let him know what I thought about him, then he absentmindedly did the same. We never did anything bad to each other besides communicating our dissapointment with the state of our friendship. It’s all moot regardless. All I want now is the money I loaned Layne back so this whole thing can be filed away. I don’t have any bad feelings towards Susan, Layne, or Sharon.   In the immortal words of Andrew, “WOW.”

      Huzzah and Chuk Chuk to you all. Unbeknownst to Katie as of yet, Andrew, Katie, and I will be filming another short movie this weekend. I've actually writing a small script for it, as opposed to our last one which was impromptu. This movie is entitled, "The Invisible Ghost" or more likely, "Jerry's Ghost is Spooky"! I've no idea, but I need a title since I'm going to put one in this movie.   I've seen "Hook", the courier, a couple times today and it's been a little awkward. I avoid his gaze and I'm sure he remembers me as "that guy who hates people that are different". Well, whatever Hooky. At least I can manipulate objects.   Did anyone figure out what the garbledeegook post says? It's a CODE. Once decrypted it will reveal a great truth to you.   Why hasn't someone invented a caffienated beer yet?  Why hasn't someone started a novely fortune cookie company yet?

          This Janet Jackson-Superbowl thing is inescapable. I was dreading going to work on Monday because of all the inane small talk (Hey, did ya hear?), but I found myself bringing it up when there was nothing else to talk about. It's the POWER of such a useless, talked-about event. If the pope was assassinated I doubt there'd be as much banter. A lot of concerened people, but they'd at least feel weird about bringing it up, as if the pope was more important than Janet.   Monkey is at the vet right now getting spayed. I hope it goes ok. She's the sweetest cat I've ever known. Even more so than Rosie...maybe. Monkey is more friendly with people, even strangers. She loves her carrying case and kneads the floor of it while purring.   I don't have the energy to argue with anyone about Bush anymore. There are two old guys at my company who gather in the kitchen for their coffee breaks just so they can harass each other and argue about sports. One of them is extremely pro-Bush and thinks he's doing a good jobas president, that we're only looking at the glass "half-empty", and that "interest rates are lower than they have been in years". I wonder why? Perhaps it was stave off an even bigger recession than we had/are having? It's the same as if someone declared that they believed abortion was a sin and girls who get them should be shot. How are you going to argue with that? They're obviously insane, so save your time and smirk silently, perhaps biding your time for a parting smartass comment.   That's another thing. How long are businesses going to use the economy as an excuse for cutting back benefits or anything else they want?   Our Geopolitics class is going downhill fast. Our teacher makes course packets we're to buy at the bookstore every two weeks, but since the book store closes at 4:30 every day, an hour and a half before evening classes start, nobody has access to them since evening class are for people whose day is filled. Our professor decides simply to rely on inaccurate information as to when the bookstore should be open, OR, in this weeks case, simply neglects to supply the store with his course packet! Community college! YES.  It's tough working full-time and taking two evening classes a quarter, but then I see that guy with no legs riding around downtown on his skateboard and I think, "Man...that is weird."

              Side 1   Theme from "Star Trek" Alien Where is Love Music to Watch Space Girls By Beyond Antares Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Earth   Side 2   Mission Impossible Lost in the Stars Where No Man Has Gone Before You are Not Alone A Visit to a Sad Planet   ----------------------------------------  Four days  Andrew ? Is your blog too much for you to handle? Maybe you should switch to bi-weekly?  Monkey ran out the door yesterday morning and scared the crap out of  Katie . Plus, we forgot to put her collar back on after taking her over to Tim and Carrie's, so that would have been terrible if she got away. This is the second time Monkey's done this and luckily each time she dashes out to the end of our walkway and freezes, staring at the huge world she barely knows about. We took her out on her leash a while ago and she actually enjoyed it, so I think she got a little taste of something she wants more of.  Yesterday as I was messing around with my computer and Katie was channel surfing she happened upon the Oprah show, this particular one about a guy who caused a girl to get in a car accident and she was horribly scarred when she was caught in the burning car. Oprah was blah blah blahing and then BAM, they showed the girl and that was rough. I've seen burn victims, but she was, in the words of the 90s advertising mentality, extreme. Needless to say it horribly scarred both of  us . Later that night I had a dream that  Tim  had gotten drunk and somehow (I think it involved skiing) gotten in an accident resulting the top right section of his head being crushed off.

          "Today Colin and I will be selling the rights to Jazz and Blues to old white guys as well as burning down poor, urban neighborhoods!"    The hunt goes on. Katie and I were approved for a very good mortgage and now we have to find a condo that meets our discriminating tastes. I've moved up in living quarter quality with every move I've made in the last couple years, so we're looking for a place with hardwood floors, as a clock with a secret door behind it is a very hard amenity to find.  Did Donnie buy a car?  I bought a LCD, flat-panel monitor yesterday! It's very exciting. I decided to finally sell all my musical equipment since it doesn't look like I'll get any use out of it, so hopefully I can make back the oodles of money I spent on all that junk. I can pay for my new monitor and put a bunch in savings either way. I'll be keeping my acoustic, my two electric guitars (nobody would buy those decorated journals anyways), and my yellow amp in case I feel like shredding it up real sleazy style. I don't know what that meant.   Andrew beat me at Scrabbe a couple days ago and it was one of the greatest moments of his life. Another one was him beating me at ping-pong. What can I say. You've got to give the little people something to shoot for, you know?

      Allrighty. So my homemade bed stinks. It's served me well for a long time, but the foam wore out and the stuff Katie and I replaced with ain't cutting it. My back has been killing me lately; luckily her parents have an extra bed we can nab. Hopefully.   "Beedrock Inc." was completed and shown to the public this weekend and it was a huge success. It's our best video to date as far as material and editing. My favorite part is the screeching metal guitar sound effect playing the classic, "wah wah wah waahhhhh" when Beedrock falls over and convulses hysterically.   We're still waiting to see what kind of a mortgage we can get. We've been looking at condos and townhouses, but won't actually go scope the places out till we get word on what we can afford.  Katie, Andrew, and I went to "Smokin' Pete's BBQ", which opened just up the road replacing the old butcher shop which went out of buisness. We were very excited when we found out a restaurant was opening no more than three blocks from our house, but it turns out the place is lousy. I had the catfish Po' Boy, which I had been very excited about, and it was the blandest fish I've ever eaten. Katie had a chicken sandwich which was decent and Andrew's meal was sub-par. Besides the sandwich they only give you a little cup of crappy potato salad and the prices! Overall it was a major dissapointment.  Go look up "Tainus" and "Tenus" at  urlLink Urban Dictionary .

       Times is hawd, times is hawd.   Whew! It's been a week! I had it up to  here  yesterday with lazy coworkers and their pathetic, slacker mantras. It's all good when you're young, but once you're pushing thirty, Dude. Get it together.   Katie and I are looking into buying a condo since interest rates are so low and there is no reason not to and tons of reason  to  do it. Not to sound like a commercial, but why throw money away on rent when you can own? This is the perfect time to buy and it's a shame more people don't realize it doesn't take that much to own property. Plus, you're making money as well when you own, as long as you live in a bustling place like Seattle where property values can only go up, unless you live on Rainier or something, and even then. Our mortgage payments on a decent condo will probably be the same or less than our current rent. Anyways, this is all new to me, so I'm having a mortgage broker find us some financing, probably 0% down. I assumed 3% or 5% down would help obtain financing, but it turns out that isn't the case. When interest rates so low, you can buy property with negligible difference in your mortgage payments without giving anyone a cent, besides fees for all the paperwork of course.  Initially, Katie and I were thinking of moving somewhere else, as we both feel Seattle is a little stagnant and we've basically gotten the gist of what it has to offer, but with my work paying for most of my school and Katie up for a big promotion (Good luck!), we figure we might as well stay. Seattle isn't bad, but we'd like to live somewhere sunnier as the gloom is very depressing. No wonder Alaska has the highest suicide and drunk driving percentages anywhere in the U.S. No sunlight! Plus the fact that everyone up there is an inbred, psycho-conservative, religious nut doesn't help either. The only place to get books where I lived was the library or Kmart, which has CLOSED. The Kmart, which only opened four or five years ago, CLOSED. So did the Burger King! How does a fast food joint go out of business? The north road, the area I used to live in, has become a bit of a Mad Max type of place because the elementary school closed and the high school is getting ready to. So many people have moved out of the area because there are no jobs that it's a bit of a ghost town.

          In the spirit of Andrew's Type O Negative praise, I would like you to consider Static-X as your premiere goth-disco-industrial band of choice. As you can see, Wayne, on the far right, has a delightfully waggish hairdo and beard! He also owns and drives a monster truck, like you see in those commericals with the exterme echo on the burly announcer's voice. The bassist is a monster unto himself and it quite hardcore for a little guy. I saw these guys for free at the Showbox (Luke had an extra ticket) and they were quite good! Wayne always makes this face when he plays and it's hilarious.       I don't normally like heavy rock bands, but these guys really don't take themselves  too  seriously, though I sometimes I wonder. The two songs that really sold me were "Loser" and "Push it". I dismiss most of these heavy goth/rock whatevers because they are absurd. The preen and pose and want desperately want you to believe they're tortured, not to mention the lyrics are sooo-hoh-hoh bad. For example, here is part of the song "See Thru You", by Staind. See the funny spelling? It's dope.   Betrayed, You left me here for dead  Betrayed, By the voices in my head  Betrayed, left my out in the rain  Betrayed, nothing left but pain    Anytime someone uses the word "betrayed" more than once in a song is a big hint that they totally suck. Also, rhyming "rain" and "pain"? These guys' writing skills are really pushing the limits. 13 year old goth kids write better poetry in their expansive journal entires about how their mom's don't get them or those "small-minded puppets" at school are idiots because they think wearing Halloween makeup year round is stupid.

           Bush put on a slide show, calling it the "White House Election-Year Album" at the Radio and Television Correspondents' Association 60th annual dinner, showing himself and his staff in some decidedly unflattering poses.  There was Bush looking under furniture in a fruitless, frustrating search.   "Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere," he said.   --------------------------------------------  WOW. How wildly inappropriate.

       You ever been with the devil?   Shane's party was a great time. The gang, consisting of Andrew, Carrie, Tim, Katie, and I, mostly hung out in Shane's room downstairs and goofed around with the video camera. "White Snake Girl" will be plastered all over the net soon. We also had some extremely juvenile fun by playing fecalphelia movies off the net on Shane's computer, which was in the direct line of sight of the pathway to the keg, so we had a handful of people doing double takes and then grotesquely contorting their face in horror. The band, who I had heard once before at a previous party of Shane's, was decent and the punch was excellent, as it consisted mostly of vodka.  I FINALLY got my copy of  urlLink Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic  working and it's pretty wicked. I've been trying to crack it for a month now and I couldn't get it working. Driving me nuts.  urlLink Max Payne 2  is also pretty schweet.   urlLink Aquaman  doesn't suck as much as he used to, but he still does somewhat.

       "Party over He-ah!"   Shane's party is tonight and it's going to be rockin'! One of the bands' drummers broke his finger, so they'll only be one band playing in his kitchen, but thats still cool. "Jerry's Ghost is Spooky" will be playing on loop out on the living room TV for all to see it's luxerious, leather seats. I can't wait to park myself on the sofa and watch people watch it over and over.   Did you know everyone in Saudi Arabia used to get everything free? That sounds a little broad, so you might ask, "Like what?" I'd say, "Everything!" They used to get healthcare, education, housing, and pretty much anything else for free! Saudi Arabians in the US as well as in their homeland would get free money from the state to build a house or do whatever they wanted! That's what you get from an enourmously rich state with not too many people in it. I hear Kuwait is the same way. Saudi Arabia had to give up all that givin' it up back in the 80s because they needed to conserve oil for the long haul and, because of the end of the oil embargos, nations were turning elsewhere for their oil, so as a result they weren't making the moola like they were before.   The word "racecar" is a palindrome.

Our "Geopolitics of the Middle East" teacher f'd Katie and I over by holding the extra credit presentations yesterday instead of next week and since he decided to have the class grade them, there is no way we can turn them in later since he's so swamped from mismanaging his time and being an old buffoon.   We're struggling to be sure, but I'm hopeful. If I can get a C, or whatever the numerical equivilant of that is, in this class I'll relax. Nowhere near the 4.0s I've been getting, but I'll take what I can get with this bastard. I've done wretched on the first two tests and the third one I aced. If I can blaze through this fourth one, I'll be set.

          After listening to, "American IV: The Man Comes Around" by Johnny Cash at great length, I've come to appreciate his withered greatness. Now, I must listen to all his early stuff repeatedly and get a feel for that. I love the song, "Sam Hall", which apparently is an old song previously about Captain Kidd, but muddled around with. Here is the back story.  --------------------------------------------- 'Jack Hall was a chimney sweep, executed for burglary in 1701.  He had been sold when a child to a chimney sweeper for a guinea and was quite a young man when Tyburn claimed him’.  Roy Palmer - a latter-day Kidson - was able to expand the story in his book The Sound of History which was printed in 1988.   ‘Jack or John Hall...was born of poor parents who lived in a court off Grays Inn Road, London, and who sold him for a guinea at the age of 7 to be a climbing boy.  Readers of Charles Kingsley’s Water Babies (1863) will know how such boys (and girls) swept chimneys by scrambling up inside them.  The young Hall soon ran away from this disagreeable occupation, and made a living as a pickpocket.  Later he turned to housebreaking, for which he was whipped in 1692 and sentenced to death in 1700.  He was reprieved, then released, but returned to crime and was re-arrested in 1702 for stealing luggage from a stagecoach.  This time, he was branded on the cheek and imprisoned for two years.  Finally, having been taken in the act of burgling a house in Stepney, he was hanged at Tyburn on 17 December 1707.’  In the 1840s a Music Hall singer W G Ross revised the song, changing the name to Sam Hall in the process.  On 10 March 1848 Percival Leigh noted the following account of an evenings entertainment in an early Music Hall:  ‘After that, to supper at the Cider Cellars in Maiden Lane, wherein was much Company, great and small, and did call for Kidneys and Stout, then a small glass of Aqua-vitae and water, and thereto a Cigar.  While we supped, the Singers did entertain us with Glees and comical Ditties; but oh, to hear with how little wit the young sparks about town were tickled!  But the thing that did most take me was to see and hear one Ross sing the song of Sam Hall the chimney-sweep, going to be hanged: for he had begrimed his muzzle to look unshaven, and in rusty black clothes, with a battered old Hat on his crown and a short Pipe in his mouth, did sit upon the platform, leaning over the back of a chair: so making believe that he was on his way to Tyburn.  And then he did sing to a dismal Psalm-tune, how that his name was Sam Hall and that he had been a great Thief, and was now about to pay for all with his life; and thereupon he swore an Oath, which did make me somewhat shiver, though divers laughed at it.  Then, in so many verses, how his Master had badly taught him and now he must hang for it: how he should ride up Holborn Hill in a Cart, and the Sheriffs would come and preach to him, and after them would come the Hangman; and at the end of each verse he did repeat his Oath.  Last of all, how that he should go up to the Gallows; and desired the Prayers of his Audience, and ended by cursing them all round.  Methinks it had been a Sermon to a Rogue to hear him, and I wish it may have done good to some of the Company.  Yet was his cursing very horrible, albeit to not a few it seemed a high Joke; but I do doubt that they understood the song.’  Ross’s ‘dismal Psalm-tune’ - also used by Walter in this recording - has been on the go for at least three hundred years and has done service for such songs as William Kidd, The Praties They Grow Small, Aikendrum and the hymn Wonderous Love.  Despite the song's age and familiarity it has only been collected from about 18 singers in the oral tradition.  It's appeal seems to have been limited to England and the USA, and there have been only six sound recordings made.  ---------------------------------------------   "Sam Hall"    Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall. Yes, my name it is Sam Hall; it is Sam Hall. My name it is Sam Hall an' I hate you, one and all. An' I hate you, one and all: Damn your eyes.  I killed a man, they said; so they said. I killed a man, they said; so they said. I killed a man, they said an' I smashed in his head. An' I left him layin' dead, Damn his eyes.  But a-swingin', I must go; I must go. A-swingin', I must go; I must go. A-swingin', I must go while you critters down below, Yell up: "Sam, I told you so." Well, damn your eyes!  I saw Molly in the crowd; in the crowd. I saw Molly in the crowd; in the crowd. I saw Molly in the crowd an' I hollered, right out loud: " Hey there Molly, ain't you proud? " Damn your eyes."  Then the Sherriff, he came to; he came to. Ah, yeah, the Sherriff, he came to; he came to. The Sherriff, he come to an he said: "Sam, how are you?" An I said: "Well, Sherriff, how are you, " Damn your eyes."  My name is Samuel, Samuel. My name is Samuel, Samuel. My name is Samuel, an' I'll see you all in hell. An' I'll see you all in hell, Damn your eyes.    Captain Kidd    My name is Captain Kidd, as I sailed, as I sailed My name is Captian Kidd, as I sailed My name is Captian Kidd, God's laws I did forbid And most wickedly I did, as I sailed, as I sailed  Oh, my parents taught me well, as I sailed, as I sailed My parents taught me well, as I sailed My parents taught me well to shun the gates of Hell But against them I rebelled, as I sailed, as I sailed  Well, I murdered William Moore, as I sailed, as I sailed I murdered William Moore, as I sailed I murdered William Moore and I left him in his gore Forty leagues from shore, as I sailed, as I sailed  And being cruel still, as I sailed, as I sailed And being cruel still, as I sailed And being cruel still the gunner I did kill And his precious blood did spill, as I sailed, as I sailed  Well, my repentance lasted not, as I sailed, as I sailed My repentance lasted not, as I sailed My repentance lasted not, my vows I soon forgot Damnation was my lot, as I sailed, as I sailed  To execution dock I must go, I must go To execution dock I must go To execution dock, lay my head upon the block And no more the laws I'll mock, as I sail, as I sail

       In their unedited state, I provide you with two lengthy emails from someone with a Master in Political Science.   Ian I promise I will let this go, but we have in this country a WIDE  GULF between reality and perception.  Let me just pose a question: who  do you suppose the largest recipient of foreign aid in the world is?  The answer would be the US.  Now in our case we get the vast majority of  our aid in the form of huge net influx of foreign currency this comes  about because of relatively high interest rates paid on what foreigners  perceive to be secure investments (real estate, blue chip stocks, gov't  securities, T-bills...etc.).  Since under Reagan, Bush I & Bush II we  have run huge budget deficits our lifestyles are financed by foreign  debt.  Americans are notoriously poor savers...most Americans spend more  than they make every year...by world standards the American people are  horrible savers...that presents and economic problem in itself.  However, with the federal government racking up $500 billion in debt/yr.  than means that as a nation we spend counting gov't., consumers, and  businesses about $750 billion more each year than our economy produces.  This is possible only because of the huge debt to foreigners we are  racking up.  However, suppose you're a poor farmer in Nigeria (or  wherever) how do you suppose he/she feels?  Because, in this example,  they live in a nation rich in oil reserves, but all of the money (and it  amounts to $30-40 billion/yr.) that Nigeria makes in oil revenues winds  up in American banks financing American consumer purchases and gov't  debt so the rich can pay even less of their fair share.  How do you  suppose that Nigerian farmer feels when he watches his son starve so  that some American can buy and SUV?  I'm thinking he probably doesn't  love us for it...go figure...thus the seeds of terrorism.   We the people and gov't of the U.S. are by far the leading funders of  international terrorism.  Saudi Arabia is a leading funder of Hezbollah,  Islamic Jihad, al-Quida...etc. (even hosting telethons on state TV to  raise money for terrorists).  Whenever, you see someone in an SUV, truck  or car proudly flying the American flag remember about 5 cents out of  every gallon of gas  they buy goes to terrorists groups, and another 20  cents or so to the governments that support and shelter them.  Given  Americans rank dead last among industrial nations in charitable giving  it is fair to say most of those good patriotic Americans donate more  money every year to terrorist groups than they do to any domestic group  (indeed on a big 10 mpg gas hog SUV driven what has become the per  capita average for Americans 15,000 miles/yr.) that person contributes  $750/yr. directly to terrorist groups and another $3000/yr. to the  regimes that support them.  Bush is the terrorists best friend his  "energy" policy, so heavy on fossil fuel consumption, guarantees them a  funding source for many years to come.   The problem with running an economy and a federal gov't on borrowed  money is sooner or later people who loan you money are going to want it  back...at that point we are in big trouble.  If we were using the debt  to fund education or research or some other activity with obvious  productivity payoffs then we are doing a good thing, but debt to pay for  a 0 productivity tax cut to the wealthy is a disaster with no positive  economic benefit.  Eventually foreigners will conclude the U.S. isn't  such a good investment option when they do we will either have to  increase interest rates to compensate them for there added risk or do  without the money...either option is going to hurt.  After all  increasing interest rates means higher mortgage rates, credit car rates,  auto, student loan rates...etc.  All of that means a recession if not  full blown depression.  My candidate for worst job in America would be  whoever follows Bush and has to clean up this mess...a thankless job.  In 2000 (Clinton's last full year in office) the federal budget SURPLUS  was nearly $300 billion.  In three yrs. Bush not only blew the $300  billion, but $500 billion more to boot...an amazing record of  incompetence.      And...   That's a good question...we've had two Ph.D. - Woodrow Wilson (Thomas  Woodrow Wilson in fact...Woodrow was his middle name) and Herbert  Hoover.  A number of Lawyers (Bill Clinton, Nixon, JFK, William Howard  Taft, who AFTER he was president, was chief justice of the Supreme  Court), a few others plus some more lawyers (Abe Lincoln being the most  notable) who "read" for the law...that is they apprenticed with a lawyer  and then took the bar exam without going to law school (or even college  in Lincoln's case).  Harry Truman was last president not to go to  college at all.  Jimmy Carter had a master's in nuclear physics which  probably brings him as close as any president to being able to say "I am  a rocket scientist (well he was close anyway)."  Some have gone to  prestigious universities (both Bushes and Clinton to Yale), JFK & FDR  Harvard...others to obscure colleges Reagan went to Eureka College in  Illinois (don't even know if Eureka is still around), LBJ to SW Texas  teachers college.  I may well be forgetting some others, but that is  sort of a cross section.  Should mention Wilson was President of  Princeton Univ. before he became governor of NJ and then president (also  holds the distinction of being the only sitting president in history to  be married in the White House...to Judith Gault...after his first wife  died), Hoover became president of Stanford Univ. after he left the White  House.  I should note we've had some president's who have gotten into  college as affirmative action entries (i.e. grades were not good enough  to be admitted on that basis).  Both Bushes fall into this category  (ironically so does John Quincy Adams who for my money may have been the  smartest of 'em all)...the Bushes (and Adams) were admitted as  "legacies" (i.e. mommy/daddy attended the university and contributed to  the alumni fund, at Yale the preference for legacies was nearly  absolute...although the policy was modified in the early 1990's  requiring that legacies show at least some academic potential).

          Why are conservatives so homophobic when they enjoy butt-raping this country so much?   I've having a hoot learning about American history! I didn't give a spit about politics till I was twenty and I always had a nagging feeling that my teenage apathy towards it wasn't productive, so I'm enjoying finally learning about how screwed up this country is.  Katie took our second-to-the-last test in our Geopolitics class and we aced it! I badged our teacher into giving us a competent review of what we'd need to know and what will be covered and, surprise! It really helped. Another bonus: we're allowed to do an extra-credit project, but he's so behind in the class that he doesn't want a written report (since that would take too much time to grade) and he doesn't want a presentation (since that would take up valuable class timee), so basically, he wants something visual and easy to grade. Wow. That is fantastic.  Tonight is Andrew and Travis' birthday party and it's going to be as much fun as throwing a shaved monkey greased up with cod liver oil down a waterslide. We've got a secret surprise planned for both of them! HINT: It involves stabbing.   Don't you love offices? They are so boring at first glace, but once the olive-colored plastic coating is scraped away, a wealth of tawdry gossip-rot is exposed. I'm not sure what that metaphor was supposed to be of.

I had a couple fillings done, luckily, before my work switched to self-insuring itself on dental, but my dentist said one filling was slightly chipped. I called back after the appointment and they said there wouldn't be a charge which I was very happy about because the way of new self-insurance works is we pay the bill in full, then MKA reimburses us. The percentage we get reimbursed run in tiers; the first $300 or so dollars is paid %100, then the next $200 is paid at 80%. This isn't such a bad idea except for that there is no allowance for what type of service you get done. It doesn't matter if you're getting cosmetic dentistry done or are just getting a routine check up; the percentage they pay is the same. This check-up came to about $140, so I should be able to have two check-ups a year totally covered, but god help me if I get a filling after I've had my two check-ups.   By the way: have you seen Mel Gibson's, "The Passion of Christ"? It totally blew me away! It was a beautiful, but realistic portrayl of our holy savior. I thought it was a wierd twist though, at the end which Jesus jumped off the cross and flew up to heaven after exploding all those Romans with his mind powers. Is that in the Bible? I don't get it.

       LTTN.   (7) Develop sidespin serves. Few beginners use sidespin on their serves; whereas, top players use sidespin on almost every serve. Sidespin is almost always combined with either topspin or backspin; pure sidespin is extremely rare in table tennis. Particularly useful is a sidespin/backspin serve that is  LOW TO THE NET  and bounces twice on the other side of the table. This type of serve will severely limit your opponent's serve return options.

       Did you know:   The  urlLink Romans were building roads  comparable in design to current highways by 312 B.C.? The roads had several layers and gravel was melted onto the top with the center of the road being slightly higher than the sides to keep water off. When highways were built through marshes they constructed a wooden frame for the road to lay in and float above the unstable ground.    urlLink Aqueducts  were amazing as well! Too bad most of them were lined with lead. To build roads through mountains the Romans would heat big rocks with fire and then throw cold water on them to crack them and then break them apart.   Do you know what an  urlLink Archimedes screw  is? It's very clever, that's what.

       The "Arachnophone".   After reading Andrew's Blog, I was amazed to hear that the publisher of his math textbook printed the Quadratic equation listed within WRONG. That is amazing. That equation is integral to so much of that vein of math and they got it wrong? I'd recommend him getting a refund, but it'd never happen. The best he might do is contact the publisher and get a new book.   Indeed, there is a catch to Andrew gift. I've dubbed it the "Arachnophone". I'm sure my loyal little exoskeletons have already sprung forth under the cloak of night to lay eggs within Fouts' nose. Once he starts coughing up eggs my revenge for that horrible night at the truck stop in Idaho will be complete.   Boy gosh, sunlight sure is great! It perks ya' right up, don't it?

       "Very good Yuri, but I'm afraid I can't pay you. BEEDROCK INC. IS BROKE!!!"   I began editing "Beedrock Inc." last night and it turned out great. I've only started, so who knows how great it'll be once I add all the fancy transition, effects, and sound track. I need to hunt down the "Golden Girls" intro theme music or something equally awesome. For those of you who haven't been reading the blog and don't know what "Beedrock Inc." is, I hope your get herpes.   Andrew and Travis' birthday mutual birthday party is this weekend and for a present I plan to make sweet, tender love to both of them.  Katie and I had a very troubling night yesterday. I got home from school and she, as usual, had a delicious dinner waiting for me, but as she prepared my plate, which was part of our new dishware set, a gift from her parents, she accidentally dropped it and it broke, sending stuffed mushroom splattering all over the floor. The look on her face was so sad, I went to give her a hug and push her back from the broken dish, but accidentally pushed her back into the hot cooking pan on the counter behind her and she got a small burn on her back. I cleaned up the mess while she laid down. Later, after I put my computer back together after installing a new harddrive, I tried booting my computer up and nothing happened. The computer wouldn't even boot up. I shouldn't be messing with computer stuff anyways because we usually only have a hour and a half before bed on school nights and I shouldn't waste it with computer crap, but I talked to Shane and I think I can fix it. I assumed I shorted it out or something retarded. I'm hopeful.

      It took great perseverance for Katie, Andrew, Tim, Carrie, and I to stay in line for the Strip-Circus on Saturday. There were a lot of older people there and not particularly hip ones either. A band of ultra-cool twenty-somethings ahead of us abandoned ship after standing in line for a half-hour and witnessing the people that were making up the line's caboose, not to mention the man with the six-inch long goatee wearing a top hat, devil wings, platform boots, and full gothic regalia standing near the entrence doors. I was determined to get into this production no matter the cost; if it was going to be lame, it'd still be a good story. The only bad thing the show could have been was banal.   At nine the we entered the deactivated automatic doors of the abandoned Safeway and paid our admission to very tall, unattractive lady who was in some sort of Halloween get-up. There was a large wall blocking a view of the main going-ons from where we paid and as we turned the corner we were met with a strange spectacle not unlike what a school gymnasium overrun by sexually charged, gothic teenagers attempting to create a world where they might feel at home amongst their own people would look like. There were small platforms where mildly enticing girls danced lazily as well as large hoops hanging from the ceiling where girls would strike poses while twirling slowly. The girl in S/M garb manning the popcorn machine was deflating because her purpose was obviously unnecessary, even though she tried to maintain appearances by striking her empty hand with her whip while doing an agressive, impatient leg twitch. Luckily, the bar was in obvious site, so after we laid claim to a large folding table, Andrew and I went and bought some gin and tonics.   Most of the employees, I hesitate to call them actors, were dressed in varying degrees of costume, but what was mostly disappointing was the lack of circus-themed outfits. Most of the "strippers" (no flesh besides the odd asscheek was ever exposed to us) were in costumes, but they were mostly outlandish goulashes from the "sexy" bin of female Halloween costumes. The whole reason I wanted to come was to see clowns stripping, but our group left long before the show was through, so who knows what they saved for the end.   A runway stood at the end of the room by our table and after a half-hour the show started. By this time I had consumed a couple drinks and at least three bags of popcorn, so I was enjoying the spectacle of amateur strippers putting on gimmicky shows, such as the school girl who folded every piece of clothing she removed and put it into her backpack; but I think the most enjoyable performance was the beefy Welshman in the kilt who barreled down the runway, did a flying leap onto the pole, and flung himself back up the runway, doing the odd cartwheel. What struck me most about him was the gleeful look on his face while he thundered up and down the stage in his combat boots; he had a wide grin and his eyes seemed almost closed in happiness the whole time. I think his underwear had fake, plastic, ivy stitched onto it.   The evening was a success in my opinion, even though Travis was extremely disappointed in the lack of skin, but I enjoyed the feeling of a freak-show being put on in what might as well have been a high-school auditorium. The whole show was done well, but was obviously patched together and that made it a lot easier to laugh and have a good time. If the performers had taken themselves too seriously, it would have been murder to watch the cowgirl unsuccessfully pop the balloons on her ass.

              Hot Clown-On-Clown Action!!!     Do you have an unnatural fear of clowns? What about strippers? If so, what better place to face your fears than a  urlLink circus-themed strip club ? It's being held in the shutdown Safeway building a couple blocks from my house and I am SO there. There will also be two bands playing, one of them doing covers of  urlLink They Might Be Giants  songs!

          Look! Look! It's  urlLink Dan Costigan ! He's my old landlord who's a total sleazebag! For the three months Layne and I lived there, we had to fight with him about getting ANYthing fixed, which everything needed because Dan didn't take care of it. When we moved in there were FIVE windows with broken panes and when we moved out they were still in that state. Before I left I put tape on the cracks and I drove by the house not too long ago; there is another family (Kinda sad that a child is subject to Dan's wankery; there is a huge hornets nest in the compost heap in the backyard and they fly all over that yard) living there and the tape is still on the windows! What a LOSER.   Man. Look at that.

           Movie Ideas:   - Something involving me having a beard and it troubling other people.   - Shoot a documentary about the 20s in black and white with us reinacting old-timey scenes in period clothes. Then, dress up like old men and watch the footage commenting on it.   - More Beedrock, but less me-in-27-shirts.   - Anything with super-slo-mo action scenes.

       We gotta go back to the top of the posts being in bold. How else are people going to tell where each post starts and stops easily? We gotta give em' some OOMPh! Some pizzaz! Something special.   Katie's taking today and tomorrow off because her vacation runs out at a set time. I wish I could take it off with her because I'm starting to lose faith in mankind. My teachers are terrible and are driving me nuts. One is insane and the other is boring. I watched a movie for two hours in class yesterday! Actually, I took notes from the book, but come on. The movie was on the Hollywood hearings where the US government was trying to weasel out the Commies.  Mildly  relevant. Not two hours worth. The teacher has started showing movies before class so I can't sneak out at the break. I don't care. I have to leave sometimes. I can't stand it. I think I'll get someone's email so they can tell me stuff when I skip.   We watched "Master and Commander" last night and it was good! A fourteen year old boy gets his arm sawed off. I'm not sure of the historical relevance of the movie though. It begins with text saying something about, "these are the times of Napoleon", but I don't Russell Crowe or his ship had anything to do with anything. He sure is a big, hunky man-bar though. Nice and thick. Real beefy. Tastes like ham.

          You know what? Bush gave me back a $250 tax refund and I'm proud to get it. Did Clinton do that? NO. He just molested that fine young girl and I swear, he should have been put to death for that. If Bush had been president then he WOULD have put Clinton to death. And why is everyone down on Bush about the economy? Interest rates are low, low, low! And why do these gays need to get married? All they want is sex anyways; getting married is just another way for them to get off on making something so holy and American perverted. If God had meant for men to do sex with one another he'd have SAID so. Oh, also, let's ship those sickies with AIDS off to Africa so they and their kind can die without bother us, make it illegal to disrespect the holy Lord, stop all this bickering and do our forefathers right and put relegion back in the schools! HALLELUJAH!!!  Also, I want a slave. A NEGRO slave. Thank you.

      Jesus lord f-ing Kristy. It's been a busy week and mah dogs is tard.   " urlLink Cold Mountain " is no good. We shut it off after fourty-five mintues because it was boring and shaping up to be another "Titanic"; a movie about an epic event, but with a lame romantic plot injected.   Coworkers are getting on my nerves and being a pain in my ass. If they're not constantly talking to themselves and annoying the hell out of me, they're not following protocol and causing everyone more work than there needs to be. Or they're just f-ing up all the time because they don't pay attention.   I didn't do as well on my History essay as I thought I would, but upon retrospect, my intro/conclusion had little to do with the thesis. Luckily Mr. Brubaker let's kids redo their tests for extra points. He's a very liberal teacher, but if the kid is interested in learning, he'll learn a lot. It's a good approach that more teachers should take, but don't because they want to get their overall classroom scores up. Students that don't want to learn shouldn't have to; they've paid their tuition and if they want to do badly in class, fine. College isn't about making people learn; it's about stroking people's hair when they're not looking.   "What do you MEAN the database is gone? How are we going to ship thoraxes?!?"   - Beedrock in  "Beedrock Inc."

It's going to be a long weekend of moving, painting, and cleaning, but it'll all be worth it to see Wah's happy face show no inclination that he knows who I am when we walk into his fanciful, little cafe.  Listen up you suckers.  urlLink Best of the West  is STILL going on and I haven't seen many votes for  Wah  on there.

          It's almost over! Katie and I signed all the papers for our new condo today and we should be getting the keys tommorow. We're planning on moving in on Saturday and painting on Sunday. I can't wait to get everything set up and be done with all these intermediary stages. That's the worst part about moving; the best is unpacking. It's like a familiar, deju vu Christmas.   I did a bunch of work on "Low to the Net" yesterday and it's coming out fantastic! The build up to Bobby's drunken rampage is paced well and, though I'm playing the lead character, I think Bobby Johnson is going to steal the show. Pigboy will be a powerful second. We still haven't cast anyone as Pigboy yet though! If we can't get someone by deadline we'll have to do something drastic like play double-parts and film them seperately. I'm looking to get the script done very soon so everyone can learn their lines for filming in the summer.

          The End of an Era...   Layne finally paid me back a little more than half of what he owed me and I'm letting it go at that. When we first rented the house in Maple Leaf he had no savings and so I paid the full $1400 dollars due up-front because I had no reservations about Layne paying me back; I’ve always admired him for his strong character and how he treats his friends well and honorably, even if it means doing things he doesn’t want to. But, I’ve finally learned that you should NEVER LEND ANYONE MONEY...not unless you are fully prepared to either A) give them the money or B) sue them for your money. When money is involved people will rationalize their way out of paying you back; it doesn’t matter if you think they’re morally on par with Jesus...things change.   I was preparing to take Layne to Small Claims court because it had been more than a year since he had borrowed the money from me and he still had not paid any of it back, even though he promised to whenever I called him; but finally, he set a time to meet me. Now, let’s break down exactly how much he owed me:   1 and 1/3 months rent = $450 + $150 = $600 Security Deposit = $100 Total: $700   Easy math, right? When we were still talking amicably after we both had moved out he said I could have his portion of the security deposit, but I told him Dan, our scummy landlord, was going to take it anyways, so that wasn’t money going towards paying me back. Even though I reiterated this fact to Layne more than once, he conveniently disregarded it. See what I mean about rationalizing? It doesn’t take much effort and look; it saved him $100! Then, he decided to either disregard or conveniently forget about the 1/3 month’s rent I paid for both of us; so there is another $150 he saved. Learn from my mistakes folks. If you want to lend large amounts of money to people, just consider it a present because once someone owes you money, you become the bad guy. He was actually angry that I suggested small claims court after almost a year of him flaking out on me every time he said he’d pay me back. I can see how he might strapped for cash though, since Layne has been helping his girlfriend Susan, who totaled his car while driving it on the freeway, pay for college. I guess her GI Bill doesn’t cover everything.   Susan has been the key reason for Layne’s character degradation, because he gets so caught up in trying to find love that he loses himself and all perspective on the world outside of his girlfriend bubble. His relationship with each one of his past girlfriends has been a slow-motion train wreck all our friends and I have watched, secretly and not so secretly being amazed and shocked at how terrible his love interests have been. We all thought Kelly was as bad as it could possibly get; Layne was somehow oblivious to her loud mouth, obnoxious opinions, disturbing obsession with her cats, and her fat belly rolling out over her way-too-tight shirts and jeans complete with the horrifying thong perpetually on display. But, at least Kelly meant well; she never did anything to anyone that I construed as mean. She was offensive to the eyes and ears, but she wasn’t a bad person. Susan on the other hand is shockingly manipulative and abusive, regardless of her obnoxiousness, which is as equally apparent as Kelly's was.   Don’t get me wrong. I wish Layne the best in life and all that cliché friends-breaking-up blah blah blah. I don’t hate him or particularly dislike him, though his recent transmogrification into a junior high school Mxpx fan only confirms for me that we’re in two very different places in life; I only wish he could see how much his character has gone downhill since he and Susan hooked up. It’s sad to see people you care about get sucked into an abusive person’s gravity. Layne has and most likely will be though for a long time, but at least Sharon has recently admitted she needs to get away from her, which I’m thankful for.

           urlLink Alan Moore , who wrote both  Top Ten  and the mini-series spin-off of it,  Smax  is a fantastic comic writer. He's also writing the comic  urlLink Powers , which is a realistic portrayl of what the real world might be like if superpowers existed. Top Ten deals with these same issues, except Top Ten is set in the future and  everyone  has some sort of super power, though not always that fantastic, such as the girl who becomes a prostitute because her superpower keeps her from catching STDs.  I know what you're thinking.  Comics ? Those are for kids. Well, Wise up you son of a bitch! They're not graphic novels either, unless you want to appear an elitist comic geek. But people who disregard comics as immature are missing out on some great titles that are written for grown-ups. Most video games are targeted at the 18-26 year old group, so you decide what is appropriate for adults and whether these people ARE even adults. Most people think of comics in terms of Superman, Batman, and the days when comics were dominated by ridiculous writing and cliche plotlines. Take a look at these pages from Powers to see how things have changed.         I can hear  urlLink Andrew  snickering right now. Frankly, I'm terrified he'll give me a massive monkey chop to the platella, or maybe even the perineum. FYI, Holy crap. Do NOT do a google image search for " perineum ". Seriously. I'm not kidding. While you're at it, don't search for " prosthetic face " either. Whew.

      Engineers are scumbags. First off, the vast majority of them are complete dorks, as most people whose jobs revolve almost solely upon math usually are. Secondly, they are socially inept to the point of coming off like assholes even if they are ok people, although some of them truly are assholes. Also, I'm picking up on a big inferiority complex with drafters, the people the use CAD to draw up blueprints and the sort. I think they are treated as sort of a menial under-class by the engineers. I know it doen't take a heck of a lot of an education to become a drafter and I know from expierience some of them are downright stupid. MARIAN.   urlLink Donnie Darko  will be re-released in theatres with new footage and some new effects. It's a great movie, so go check it out.   Carrie, we got Frontline for our cats, so don't worry. All the fleas are dead now. Except for those few that burrowed into your ear and are laying eggs in your brain.   Again, I must remind all of you who have eaten at Wah's Jade West Cafe: Email everyone you know that lives in West Seattle and urge them to vote for Wah's at  urlLink www.WestSeattle.com .

          Disgusting! Both  Monkey and Bojee have fleas ! I took them into the bathroom one at a time, got into the bathtub with them, and then sprayed them down with some flea-killing toxins. It actually wasn't a very traumatic expierience; I assumed Bojee would flip out and piss her pants, but she didn't seem to mind so bad. Both of the cats actually got very submissive once I manhandled them a bit. I had Monkey on her back and I was spraying her belly while holding her forearms with my hand and she just sat there, not even mewing or shaking. After that I combed their hair with a special flea comb and the bugs started coming out. It was terrible. Every now and then these small bugs would get caught in the teeth of the comb and I'd wash them down the sink. What's strange is we didn't find out about the fleas till Katie actually picked one out of Bojee's fur. Aren't they supposed to make animals itch and bite their skin? Regardless, we'll probably have to bomb the house with spray just to make the whole place is sterile.  Katie and I are closing on  our  urlLink West Seattle  condo  very soon. We'll be going to the condo to have the inspection done on Saturday and if all goes well, we'll officially be the owners by Tuesday or so. We don't get the keys till the 29th though. We're doing a two week closing instead of the normal month long because it'll save us money on fees and what not, but we've got to get all this figured out with our current landlord, who is a nice as a grandma on painkillers, so I'm not worried. The best part about our new place is being able to walk over to  urlLink Wah's diner  and have some hangover breakfast...I mean...no, that's right.   Check out  urlLink Arrested Development  on Fox. It's hilarious and  urlLink David Cross  is one of the main actors, so it can't be all bad, although I did see " urlLink Run Ronnie Run " and WHEW. I can smell that stinker from here.

       Orgasmic Headaches   Yesterday Katie and I looked at a great condo out in West Seattle very close to where I used to live; we're preparing to make an offer on it because, although it's a one bedroom, it meets all our other desires for a place: it's cheap, in a fantastic location, it's pet-friendly, and the actual condo is very unique and liveable. This whole process if mind-numbing, but overall definitley worth it. What bothers me is not quite being sure whether you're getting the best interest rate and what plan to use. There are way too many possiblites and that always hurts my eyes, but after talking to our realtor, who's very good, he says we're getting a good plan, so that relaxed me some.   Bojee has fleas! I can't believe it. It was so gross, Katie picked at her fur and pulled off this big ol' flea all while Bojee sat there purring. We're getting both of the cats medicine tonight, but I still feel like a negligent parent.

      I'm not doing this weekend justice, but we got a lot done! On Friday we had everyone over to shoot another episode of "Beedrock and Boomer". This episode was entitled, "Hail to the beedrock" and Beedrock got it in his crazy exoskull that he should run for Transportation commissioner. I've yet to edit it, but I've high, high hopes. Once this is done I'll be mailing out DVDs to all my...our fans.  On Saturday the whole gang went out to Giggles to see Dat Fan, the winner of Last Comic standing. He was hilarious as we figured he would be, but two of the openers, one we had seen before, were great! The most noteworthy was a guy who had muscular dystrophy. He had trouble walking and spoke with difficulty, though it was understandable, but the guy was hilarious! The entire crowd thought it was a horrid joke at first, then he says, "Now, who here is uncomfortable?" After that he started making fun of handicapped people and everyone got a little more comfortable.  On Sunday Katie and I went out to her Aunt's house for a great Easter. Lots of amazing food and an Easter egg hunt! We won a couple dollars and a bottle of wine. Her aunt, along with the rest of her family, adores me.

      It took Andrew a little less than two days to provide an in-depth correction of my incorrect reference to Lithuania's geographical position.   Have all you geeky adults heard about the new teenage rage? You lame grown-ups might be familiar with "the pit" or "the mosh pit", a circular section of a concert crowd where teenage boys release hormonal and emotional aggression by beating the crap out of each other. Well, "the pit" has been replaced with "the rbot Pit", where instead of thrash-dancing, all the kids in the middle do that crazy dance, "the robot". Actually I'm lying, but I wish this were true.

          Katie and I found a parking spot near  urlLink Graceland  after a half hour of stressful, slow-paced driving downtown spent looking first for a parking spot,  then  Graceland since we lost it, and  then  a parking spot again. We waited in a small line comprised of ugly girls dressed in eccentric clothes of questionable taste and inspiration outside the club for a half hour. Before we had even gotten to the club Katie had warned me of the type of people that usually hand out at these kind of places, namely teenagers with nothing better to do than try their best to dress like mutants from the 80s...and she was right. I was shocked! The extent some of these girls (there were some boys doing this as well, but the girls were most eye-gouging) went to look unique when they all ended up looking like part-time employees of  urlLink Hot Topic  and making their way through art school. They finally opened their doors and we found out there were two local bands opening and  urlLink The Sounds  weren't on till 9:45pm! I had ditched Psychology to go to this concert and I could have gone to both! We had almost three hours ahead of us and we lazily discussed over gin and tonics in the bar what we were going to do with our free time .   We left and walked down to Alfi's Deli and Mini-mart and walked around amusing ourselves by antagonizing each other's choice of candy; I preferred something with depth and culture, like the king sized  urlLink Payday  bar, while Katie preferred the boring, chocolate, non-ice cream Dove bar. We returned to the club in time to see the first band start, an all female, teenage quartet. They had some great songs, but usually deflected your interest with a long, boring bridge. They showed a lot of promise and had a unique sound which is pretty uncommon with teenage garage bands. The following group,  urlLink The Vue , was much too full of energy. Their lead singer and lead guitarist battled for who could pull of the most cliche rock star moves every song and ended up distracting the audience from the actual music, which could have been good if it wasn't for the constant screaming of the lead singer.   Finally, The Sounds came on and as Katie will attest, it was a great show. They played perfectly and sounded just like the CD, only more rockin'. The lead singer was the obvious star; she was dressed in a strange Joan Jett type of get-up with a leather jacket and bad tattoos and she completed the 80s rock performance with her quirky, Swedish convulsing and Go-Go's style, two step dancing. Each band member had enough Scandinavian weirdness to be interesting; the guitarist had a Mohawk-mullet and a big, gold pirate earring; the keyboards looked about 14 years old, the bassist looked like a awkward teenage metal kid who was the size of an ape. The drummer just looked smarmy, though he was wearing black drummer's gloves.  Their show ended with the keyboardist and lead guitarist getting into a drum solo duel on a pair of electronic drum pads. Maja Ivarsson, the lead singer, got up on the bass drum to sing and jump off, complete with rock star leg-kicks; she also leaned way out into the crowd a couple times, in one instance making a silly face while grasping a fanboy's hand, then hawking a huge loogi into the crowd. Maja wasn't what I'd call ugly, but her eyes are position strangely and her hair was an appropiately clumpy mess. She had a  urlLink Modesty Blaise  tattoo the back of her forearm which prompted me to wonder when it became lame to have tattoo. I used to think it was cool, but even good tattoos are pretty dumb in my book. They good ones (98% of them aren't) might look allright when you're young, but what happens when you're 36 with kids and have a tattoo of a skeleton on your bicep? Admittedly a skeleton isn't a cool tattoo, but you get my point.

          "We would have moved heaven and earth to try and stop it"   Riiiiight, but then, what would your administration's re-election campaign be centered on? Oil? Education? Taxes?  EVIL ?  By the way, check Andrew's blog for the full story, but the other weekend Andrew, Katie, and I had a small barbecue of Yak, Buffalo, and Ostrich, which is actually red meat even though it's a bird. They all tasted mostly like a very lean beef, but with indefinable quirks. I wanted Kangaroo.  The next  63rd St. Productions  short film will be a continuation in the  Beedrock  series. Andrew has written the script which is entitled , " Hail to the Beedrock ". Beedrock finds himself running for some sort of government office and hilarity ensues in liquid form.  Katie and I are going to  urlLink The Sounds  tonight and it's gonna be rockin'.   urlLink Trader Joe's  is a amazing store. Everything they sell is organic and VERY good, but most importantly, cheap! You would assume hippy organic food is expensive, but not there for some reason! They probably save money on advertising (I've never seen a commercial for them) and they don't have bag boys, so there's some more change in your pocket. Katie buys a frozen pizza from them that is delicious; it's got chopped up pear over gorgonzola cheese. Oh my lord. I've got this thing for rotten cheese.

       Dead Pixel Policy?   Can you believe there is such a thing? Apparently, a big problem with LCD monitors is "dead pixels", or pixels that are inert and don't display any colors, just white light. Some companies will even refuse to give you a refund or a new monitor unless there are X amount of dead pixels on your monitor. Lucky for me Dell will take back your defective monitor and replace it for free, no shipping charges going either way for the customer! Nice. Of course, I'm out of a monitor for the time it takes to get my new one in, but l still have my old one and can use it in the meantime. I was about to sell it to someone too! I hope I can find another buyer.   "HullocanIspeaktoMarianKubicka?"    I have to hear this from Marian Kubika's stupid kid every time I man the phones at the front desk. Marian doesn't have much going on upstairs, so I can only imagine her offspring. She's from Lithuania or some other ridiculous country in the Balkans. Now I just wait for Andrew's know-it-all comment.

       i donot understand why you will leave me a neutral feedback. 1-3 bad pixel is normal for all of LCD by the industry standard in my memory. if you want to change or complain, you should do it to manufactory. it come with warranty. Jie   I received my new 17" Dell LCD monitor in the mail yesterday and it is fantastic, except for a damaged pixel which shows up like a digital cancer whenever I have anything dark-colored on my screen. The guy I bought it from on Ebay won't do anything about it because he resells new merchandise and states, "NO REFUNDS!" I don't buy it though. Just because you're reselling new merchandise doesn't relieve you from treating your customers fairly. Now I'll probably have to use the manufacturers warranty and pay a good wad of cash to ship my defective monitor and get a new one back, if Dell will even do that for me. Who knows. I might keep it. Depends how much shipping is.   Condo searching is frustrating! All the places that are perfect for us sell right away, have some insidious history or costly upcoming repairs, or don't allow pets! I won't settle for a place that isn't great because we're buying, not renting, and I'll have a lot more invested in this property. We'll probably end up renting it out when we move out of it in a couple years, so it needs to be a good place.   I'm considering putting a password on my blog so I can rant to my wildest dreams without worrying about certain people reading this page. I would like for people to be able to look my name up on the web and get this blog as a result; it's a hard call.  Andrew got his car back! I TOLD him to wait around and make sure it's gone for good before buying a new car and looky here. Validation is so delicious on my lips.

         Oh lordy lordy. Things have been busy! I was planning on taking two classes this quarter like I've been doing, but I wasn't exactly on top of registering for classes which caused some problems. I was going to take one regular class and one online, but I was unaware that some online classes start before NSCC's normal classes start, so when I registered I was already almost a week late on the online class. I decided after feeling slightly guilty and then enormously relieved to drop the class and only take Psychology. I'll need the extra time to find a condo and finish " Low to the Net ".  The search for a condo goes on. We've got a lead on a suh-WEET place out in West Seattle we're going to jump on ASAP. We were hesitant to consider West Seattle as a possible living area because we'd like to stay close to Ballard, but the way the market is, it doesn't look like we'll be able to find/afford anything near there that is very nice. We found some nice places that were in not-so-hot neighborhoods and visa versa. After thinking about it I'm very excited to go back to West Seattle. I've got some  tainted  experiences there due to a creepy homeless man living underneath Layne and I's apartment, but mostly it was a great place to bike (I can break out the bike!) and walk around. It's a very nice area, though I've only recently come to comprehend how bad White Center is. I've never been in the heart of that area before, but Katie and drove through and WOW. It's a sprawling ghetto dropped down onto the south (where else?) section of the domestic, faux-island.  I disagree with the term African-American, Asian-American, or any other similar label. It's demeaning and lessens minorities validity as citizens. If someone is actually from Africa then I can understand why they might want to represent their homeland by stating their allegiance to both places, but using that term for a black citizen of America is offensive. I'm not European-American because my dad was born in Denmark, I'm American; the reason I'm not called the former is because the default color in America's mindset is blanco. During the last summer Olympics I remember listening to a radio disc jockey (scum) comment that all the members from the America team that won medals weren't even American, he surmised from their ethic names. The right-wing, conservatives in this country view non-whites as aliens in this land because they hold steady to the idea that the United States was founded by a bunch white guys. While this may be true on paper, the construction of this county was built on the backs of minorities and conservatives refuse to acknowledge this fact clearly shows the truth that many of our leading ancestors raped whomever they could to get whatever they could get.

I don't know what song it is, but in this tune I heard by Johnny Cash he snorts some coke, shoots his girl, and attempts to kill himself all within the first line of the verse.  To note, Andrew and I have coined a couple terms I think will benefit humanity and it's wealth of obscure anatomical terms:   Tenus (TEE-nus) Tainus (TAY-nus)   Both of these words are in reference to that Taint. If none of these words make sense to you, I sure as jack won't explain them.

       urlLink Yes.  A new season of Family Guy. And a new  urlLink Family Guy toy  as well!   Although Family Guy was canceled two years ago by Fox, the show's passionate fan base refused to let it die. In response to the show's continued popularity in syndication on the Cartoon Network and a record number of DVD sales, Fox recently announced the return of Family Guy and will be producing 35 new episodes set to debut in early 2005. This exciting announcement marks the first time in television history a canceled show has been renewed based on the success of DVD sales.   Also, Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy, will have a NEW cartoon premiering on the Fox Network called "American Dad".    AMERICAN DAD, from "Family Guy" creator SETH MacFARLANE, is the animated story of STAN SMITH (MacFARLANE), who works for the CIA and is constantly on the alert for terrorist activity. Stan will go to extremes to protect his beloved America from harm - as evidenced by the terror-alert color code on his fridge, and his frequent knee-jerk reaction of shooting holes in the toaster whenever the toast pops up. In addition to Stan's wife and teenage children, the Smith household has two rather unconventional members. There's ROGER (MacFARLANE), the sarcastic space alien Stan rescued from Area 51 who deeply resents the fact that he's not allowed to leave the house, and KLAUS (DEE BRADLEY BAKER, "Stripperella," "Johnny Bravo"), a lascivious, German-speaking goldfish - the result of a CIA experiment gone seriously wrong.   Go  urlLink here  for a recent interview with Seth MacFarlane.

          Tonight is the big night for Tim! It's his bachelor party and who knows what kind of crazy hijinks will happen! Everyone was supposed to come up with a funny prank to pull on him tonight, so I decided that once he's good and drunk and acting stupid I'm going to saw his head off with a hacksaw. I can't  wait  to see the look on his face!     urlLink "You're funny. I like you. Uhhh, so, who were you talking to on the other line? Your boyfriend?"     The U.S., which has 5% of the world population, will have a quarter of its prisoners in the year 2000. A quarter of all men in the U.S. are in jail. Prisoners are being oursourced to private industries and earning little to nothing for wages. People outside of prison can't find jobs because prisoners are being hired for next to nothing to do those jobs. Once the prisoner, who has been building CPUs for computers or some other valuable skill, gets out of jail, nobody will hire him because he was in jail. It's time to wear our shoes on our heads and our hats on our feet people, because  urlLink this country is completely backwards .   March 10, 2004 Â Question: Where in the United States can you find a call centre worker who is never absent, is always on time, is ready to work for a fraction of the going wage in the industry and will stick with his job for at least three years?   Answer: In the prisons, of course.   Some US firms are now turning to prisons to hire inmates as telemarketers and save US jobs from going overseas to low-wage nations like India, China and the Philippines.   A report in The Guardian said that the prison inmates are model employees for the US call centre industry: they speak courteously on the phone, are never late or absent, and gladly work as low as $130 a month. Also, in an industry which is plagued by high employee turnover, the prisoners are like a boon as they work for at least three years.   Perry Johnson, a Southfield, Mich.-based consulting company, is one such company which chose to remain in the United States rather than join a host of telemarketing companies moving offshore.   Earlier, Perry Johnson had planned to move to India, says The Guardian. But the company chose instead to open a call centre inside the Snake River Correctional Institution, a sprawling razor wire and cinder block state penitentiary a few miles west of the Idaho line.   "The center's opening followed a yearlong effort by the Oregon Department of Corrections to recruit businesses that would otherwise move offshore, and echoes a national trend among state and federal prisons to recruit such companies," said the newspaper.   "This is a niche where the prison industry could really help the US economy," The Guardian quoted Robert Killgore as saying. Killgore is director of Inside Oregon Enterprises, the quasi-state agency that recruits for-profit business to prisons.   "I'm really excited about this. We keep the benefits here in the United States with companies where it's fruitless to compete on the outside," said Killgore, reported The Guardian.   Prison authorities have praised work programmes aimed at enhancing inmates' skills and self-respect and keeping them from falling back into criminal activity.   But some workers union have criticised the move as taking jobs away from the private sector. Critics say the idea of retaining American jobs in prisons is a violation of minimum wage laws and an affront to free workers.   Killgore, however, says that such protests are debatable as the jobs would have moved out of the country anyway.   The national prison labor trade groups support the idea. Ten states including Oregon employ inmates in for-profit call centers. Oregon and many others also make garments and furniture Â industries that have largely moved offshore, other than in prisons. Inmates are paid between 12 cents and $5.69 an hour, according to Bureau of Prisons statistics, said The Guardian.   Long-term inmates, meanwhile, are quite happy doing the job and "not wearing a ball and chain."   Perry Johnson managed to open its call centre in the Oregon prison for half the price of relocating to India, and achieved many of the same benefits, according to Mike Reagan, director of Inside Oregon Enterprises at Snake River, said The Guardian.   At Snake River, to qualify for the call centre job, inmates must have three to five years remaining on their sentence. Outside, the typical turnover is nine months. Randomly screened Also, inmates make good telemarketers, The Guardian report said, quoting prison officials.   The prisoners work 40-hour weeks in rows of nondescript cubicles.   The newspaper said that the convicts pitch Perry Johnson's quality control consulting service to executives at American businesses, sometimes even company presidents. Prison officials randomly monitor inmates' phone conversations, and all calls are digitally recorded to discourage personal calls or illegal activity, said The Guardian.

           Samoans are Obese.   The company I work for is buying Hawaiian shirts with our logo stitched on the front for all our employees to wear at an open house coming up where we get to see what all the engineering expert groups are up to and this morning in the lunch room the new girl Angela ( who happens to be Mormon, if that helps you glean more insight into her personality ) and one of the engineers were trying on sample shirts. The engineer commented that they were roomy in the front and Angela said that all "those people" are fat and that's why Hawaiian shirts are so big. Stunned, I turned and asked her to repeat what she just said and she obliviously reiterated that "y'know, Samoans are always so fat". I gave her  Andrew's "Wow"  and tried to mind my own business as the people around us tittered nervously because of her idiotic statement. She tried to rearticulate what she meant, but only dug herself a deeper grave with her stereotypic shovel. I asked her if it was true that all white people like stereotypes and she quizzically raised an eyebrow. Everyone nervously started to disperse once they realized that the conversation wasn't all fun and games.   On a previous occasion the men in the office were bitching about why Annika Sorenstam needed to play golf with men and that "women have their own league" and I animatedly agreed that, "Yeah! First we let blacks play and now women?". Everyone stopped laughing and again, nervously dispersed. I seem to cause that to happen often, though usually it's because I'm in a restaurant and acting obnoxious, or more likely, because I farted.    Remember:  Too much class is a dangerous thing and it's better to be on the safe side.

           Wah, Ralph, and Captain Cook.   Along with helping Wah's Jade West cafe to win some recognition in WestSeattle.com's "Best of the West" contest, I hereby dedicate myself to convincing the Grand Illusion Theatre to play " Crossroads " with Ralph Macchio on one of their late-night showings, where they typically play more eccentric films.  Also, " Hail to the Beedrock " will be done very soon and a DVD consisting of " Jerry's Ghost is Spooky " as well as the two episodes of the Beedrock series will be burnt. Anyone who wants a copy should buy me a DVD-R disc.   Katie and I will be taking a trip to Alaska to visit my family from 8/20 to 8/27. I'll soon be accosting Tim, Carrie, and Andrew as to whether or not one of them wants to watch over them while we're gone. Travis, that night was special to me, but I can never trust you with a small mammal again.    NOTE:   My last name is pronounced: Krist-ten-sen, not Christ-tian-sen. I'm perplexed as to why I have only recently realized I've been misprounouncing my last name all these years. Probably because it used to be spelled the more traditional way until my dad moved to the United States and then he changed it to the current spelling, so I always had that original spelling and pronunciation stuck in my mind.

       The Mariners suck, Vietnamese sandwiches are orgasmic, and parents can be  so  stressful.   Some salesmen from  urlLink Specialty's  came by and gave me a cookie. The nerve of those ad-whores coming in here and...ohhh...ohh, that's a good cookie. That is good. By the way, Soy Delicious ice cream is also extremely edible.   On Friday Andrew, Katie, and I saw the Mariners lose like the suckers they are to the Detroit Tigers. We left after the 7th inning with the seadogs failed to score their first run, not point, but run. After we had left the stadium we heard an expansive sigh from inside, but it turned out that the bases were loaded and Edgar Martinez struck out. Also, I lost the boat race on the jumbo-tron. GREEN!!! GREEEEEEN!!!!  On Saturday my dad came up in the morning to visit since he hadn't seen our new condo yet. It is usually very stressful to hang out with my dad for more than a day or two, but it wasn't too bad this time. He helped me look at a problem with the vent leading away from our dryer to the outside where the steam is released; I don't believe it's serious, but we're still looking into it. Monkey was extremely interested in Pooky, but Pooky was uncharacteristically contrary. Monkey kept chewing on Pooky's tail-fur and he'd let out a yelp for some reason that would scare Monkey away. Bojee was surprisingly brave and ventured out to sniff Pooky a bit, but Pooky was practically growling at her. He's usually such a friendly dog!   On Sunday Katie and I sewed dresses and did homework, respectively. My psych class is coming along well and I anticipate a good grade. I'm going to North Seattle Community College because it was convenient for where I was living at the time, that being Ballard and the Northgate area, but since we've moved out to West Seattle I thought I'd investigate South Seattle Community College, which is only 10 minutes away. Why is it that areas south of cities are reserved for poor, ethnic communities? It seems like the general rule of thumb in most American cities. Perhaps the South set the precedent for tainting that cardinal direction? Anyways, I was optimistic after looking through SSCC's catalog because they had a good amount of night classes, something Central had next to none of. Once we got there though it became clear that SSCC was little more than a government subsidized auto/aviary/heavy machinery trade school for poor blacks, latinos, and asians. I wonder if they have an off-campus basketball training camp?   On that note,  urlLink Bill Cosby  was recently quoted voicing some controversial opinion in regards to poor, black America.  urlLink Here  is a interesting debate on the BET.com message boards in regards to Mr.Cosby's remarks.

       I'm not Danish anymore.   It looks like children born to Danish citizens only retain their citizenship as long as they reside in Denmark by the time they turn 22; I'm 23 and I obviously do not live in Denmark, so I'm no longer Danish. Oh well. They'll never take my infectious, lilting laugh away.

Last night  Katie, Andrew, Gerry, and I  went to  urlLink the Cardigans  at  urlLink Neumo's , or rather, Katie and I were there on-time at 8pm when Andrew  said  he'd be there, but he and Jerry showed up an hour and a half late while we had been sitting there waiting around people-watching. The bands started late and the two openers, Jonathan Rice and Christian Kjellvander, who were both solo, tortured artist-men with guitars, sucked terribly, so we sat around some more. I had two drinks throughout the night, though I would have loved more; drinks at these types of place are so expensive it's not economically worth it to get many. The Cardigans didn't start till almost 11:00 pm or so and they sucked. Actually, they were good, but after waiting around for almost three hours, I wasn't in the mood to listen to a bunch of slow, lush, love songs, so Katie and I left at midnight. Andrew and Jerry stayed around for a while longer to  not  talk to girls.

           Neighborhood Republican Root-Out!   Alright! It looks like my neighborhood is being true to Western Washington's reputation for being excessively liberal. Unfortunately, there are always a couple bad apples...and here they are:   urlLink Irene B. Brooks , a US Commissioner who lives a couple blocks from me. She donated $2000 to Bush, but then again, I can understand why.   In 1989 she was appointed by President George Bush to serve as the United States Commissioner to the Delaware River Basin Commission, a five-member regulatory and quasi-judicial agency managing the water resources within the 13,000-square-mile Delaware River Basin. She helped formulate federal policy, coordinating a consensus among all federal agencies and working with Congressional committees, individual Congressmen and staff members plus state and federal representatives.    urlLink Gerald R. Kingen  contributed $2000 to Bush as well. He's a business owner, so he's probably happy with Bush's tax breaks for the wealthy, although in the long run he's spending more under Bush's economic plans as well as having his money devalued by the future inflation that's sure to happen because of Bush's enormous war debt.  Funny! Almost all the people that contributed to Bush's campaign are CEOs, vice-presidents of companies, or plain old wealthy; except for  David C. Manderscheid , who contributed $250 dollars. He's a courier for  urlLink Postal Express . He must have saved up for months to make that donation!  That's all for today's, "Neighborhood Republican Root-Out"!

          Scandinavian Freak Show.   Yesterday Katie and I went to Ballard for one of her company team's baseball games and the Norway Parade happened to be exploding that day, sending pickled fish and onion all over the place. Ballard is a small, locally coveted area originally populated by Norwegian and other Scandinavian immigrants; it's apparent by some of the local artwork and Scandinavian gift stores, but it was never more in-your-face than yesterday, when high-schoolers dressed up in their native ethnicity's garb, waved flags, and blew sousaphones to celebrate their kooky cultures. I've never seen Ballard as packed with people as it was yesterday, although mostly it was fat housewives in their SUV's driving down one-lane roads and giving us the stink eye for not pulling onto the sidewalk for them.   Do you know the Hummer gets worse mileage than Ford's Model T? Plus, people look like idiots driving them.

Is it any wonder why it is that conservatives end up driving this country into the ground and then liberals have to patch it back up again? All conservatives are interested in are getting rich and regulating people's personal lives, whereas liberals are more concerned with the issue of keeping our country healthy.

I was going to pull some choice excerpts from his most recent post, in which he articulates just how messed up the world is, but I can't do it; his entire blog is full of ridiculous, new-age ramblings. He spelled "granted" as "granite" and seems to ignore the existence of capital letters. It must be his unique style, like spelling words with numbers.   By the way, go check out  urlLink Buddyhead 's gossip page. I haven't decided whether these kids are complete dorks or guys low-browing it for fun. Either way they're funny and can articulate the proper contempt for  Fred Durst  excellently.

The sleeping bag represents Andrew's safe place, where he can reveal his homosexual desires without fear of persecution from the outside world for his natural urges. The steep hill represents his future decline into the tawdry world of gay porn, ending up being stabbed by a rough trick named Steve.

           Kristensen Buoys Local Amateur Table Tennis League's Morale   Seattle, WA   Top Table Tennis Champion Ian Kristensen took part in a amateur table tennis match on Saturday for charity and played in a brief "Round Robin" event with local players. Travis Hall, another noted Table Tennis player, participated as well.   Local fans invited to play in the event were Andrew Fouts, a renowned local tailor of older women's clothes, and Tim Hollingshead, a local haberdasher who specializes in unusably large hats. Kristensen competed playfully with both Fouts and Hollingshead much to the crowds delight, but gracefully showed respect to the local players by allowing them the winning point, also preventing a match-up between him and Hall, which surely would have caused undue stress and excitement in a crowd used to amateur table tennis matches.

      How is Bush still tied with Kerry in public approval after all of this? Everything he says is a lie, yet conservative boobs around the nation still applaud his "decision-making skills".  2948 Americans died in 9/11 and to date around 730 have died in the War on Terrorism. We're averaging about 15 Americans dead every day, so by June 30th, the supposed transfer of power, we'll be up to around 1550 people dead. And, there is no way we'll pull out completely by then, so I'm sure we'll have a comparatively small trickle of deaths for quite a while after that date. What's been accomplished? We opened up Iraq to be controlled and overrun by the religious extremists, not to mention pissed off the more moderate Iraqis so much that they wouldn't mind Americans dying in large quantities either. Bush lovers are INSANE. Seriously.

It's a good thing us West Seattlites do a thorough job editing our web logs; those unseemly faux-Scandanavians post rubbish that isn't fit to print in Hustler's, " Good Housewife Monthly Digest ". If my blog hasn't been updated in a day or two, rest assured it's because I'm working on a quality piece of literature, but that's nothing I'd expect some  Ballardite  to appreciate; after all, it's not a televised boxing match or warm can of cheap beer, so how could they?  Our new place in Seattle's Upper Crust is almost ready for viewing. We'll have a housewarming party soon, so everyone prepare for a good, old-fashioned naked barbeque.

       A Dune For Every Man...   Last Friday my friends and I, after getting sufficiently liquored up, mustered up the gumption to go down to The Sands, a strip club up the road from our collective neighborhood. I can only guess their reasons for wanting to go, but mine sprang forth from a grotesque fascination with the sleazier side of life. I've never been to a strip club and have never wanted to go, at least for the typical reasons. While I objectively see nothing morally or legally wrong with the sex industry, personally I hold its workers in low regard; to summarize why: I don’t have respect for people who sell their bodies in a sexual manner. Strippers, Porn star, Hooters girl…they’re all shades of the same thing no matter how you try to rationalize it. My interest was of a curious nature; I wanted to affirm my suspicions and see if strip clubs were indeed harmless and no less repulsive to than an unkempt, older woman wearing a uni-color track suit.   My friends Tim and Carrie will be getting married soon and all the fellas are throwing Tim a bachelor party, which will include more than one strip club I’m sure, as well as some vomiting and auto-erotic asphyxiation. So, I felt the need to prepare myself, not to mention appeasing a growing train-wreck fascination with seeing how a real strip club matched up with the picture I have in my head: A bunch of drunk, scummy guys ogling girls of questionable aesthetic desirability and decision making skills who take their clothes off.  The most disturbing thing about The Sands was that it was everything bad I had imagined a strip club to be, which made the dirty reality of it even more shocking. Though I had envisioned strip clubs to be extremely unattractive, disgusting places, I assumed they’d be rather lively, with lots of laughing and yelling; a big, dirty, hedonistic party. The Sands was not a party, in fact, it was a wholly disturbing and depressing place of astonishing magnitude. The world could, and should, be split into people who would enjoy The Sands and everyone else. Someone who might enjoy such a place might also enjoy Hooters restaurant…for the girls and not the food. They also might enjoy NASCAR, silk shirts, and their ponytails.   These men must also enjoy walls made of lit-up glass squares, of which the classy, curving entrance wall to The Sand is comprised.  To tell the truth, the 80s-style glass brick wall set me slightly at ease. It was a calming sight and led us straight ahead, no stressful decisions to be made like, “what do I do if someone makes eye contact with me? Look away? Nod my head agreeable? Tip them?” As we rounded the transparent curving wall into a long, dark room running perpendicular to us we were met with a small service desk on our left and a small stage directly ahead of us. The stage was five feet square and had stripper’s poles at each corner, which struck me as unconventional. To the left of the stage was seating; benches running along the walls with tables and chairs placed in front. Past the stage was the strippers’ VIP area, where the girls relaxed till it was their turn on the rotation, which was surprisingly fast, perhaps due to a lack of performers.   I’ll try to describe the girls as best I can, though to me they were all windshields and metal in a scandalously clothed car crash. There was a darker skinned girl with an oversized chest, strangely enough the only girl with big boobs; a Thai girl whose maniacal, unwavering smile threatened my confidence in her mental health, an enormous, unsmiling Black woman who dwarfed the stage, and an Asian girl who was perhaps the only arguably attractive one of the bunch. She was also the only girl who displayed any sort of stage talent beyond a capacity to writhe ridiculously on-stage in extreme slow-motion. By far the girl that captured the spirit of The Sand most perfectly was a burnt-out, coked-out, 80s girl, and I use that term loosely, who flopped about to “Come As You Are”, by Nirvana. Andrew recalled that at one point it looked like she had passed out and was merely twitching her arm in some physiological reflex. Before or after her performance, (I can’t remember which...the entire night was a hand-over-mouth blur) I glued my eyes to the stage because 80s chick was sitting across from me at a table on the other side of the narrow room, staring towards me while adjusting one of her sock-prostitute-garter thingies, he leg propped up on a table. I assume that if I had met her gaze she would have either offered a lap dance or started screaming about how I sexually assaulting her when she was five. I might also note that The Sands had no bouncer that I could see. There was an overweight man in the rear of the seating area getting a lap dance and he had his hands all over the girl, but apparently that isn’t a concern for the establishment. I’m sure the girls can make a few extra bucks with that added leeway.  If 80s chick represented The Sands’ spirit in form, the moment that most encapsulated that fine nightclub was when our waitress, Shandi or Krystal or something, brought us our drinks (Diet Cokes since drinking alcohol in Seattle strip clubs is illegal) and dropped the entire tray in front of us. Andrew found it hilarious, but I was mortified that such an embarrassing thing happened to a girl in such an embarrassing place. I can only imagine whether her pay was docked for the broker glasses.  Andrew and Travis reassured me that The Sands is one of the worst strip clubs they’ve ever been to and that the upcoming bachelor party will be full of higher quality venues, but I doubt it will make a large difference. I’m sure the clubs willl be more modern and less visually horrifying than The Sands, but the basic principles that set my skin crawling are the same. Still, I'm looking forward to it; everyone needs to have a dead-stripper crisis once in their life and I see a limited number of ways to reach such a predicament.

      Two years ago the  urlLink school voucher program was approved , dealing a blow to public schools everywhere by allowing children who attend school that fail to meet testing guidelines to attend private schools using public taxpayer's money.  Bush, who has imposed new, strict testing requirments on schools with the  urlLink No Child Left Behind  act while underfunding them at the same, has made it difficult for already underfunded schools to meet passing marks. A large portion of children transferring to private schools under this new law transfer to religious school, angering many whose tax dollars are helping fund what basically amounts to a religious education.   Luckily, the Colorado supreme court recently ruled the  urlLink voucher system was unconstitutional  for obvious reasons. If Bush gets four more years, we'll undoubtedly see more underhanded attacks on godless public schooling.

The humor is intelligent and tailor-fit to kids in their early 20s.   Go play five addicting games, which include hurling, tossing, or catapulting penguins, over at  urlLink Yeti Sports .

      Look for more from Marcia Thompson Eldreth in the upcoming days; she'll be a regular contributor to the blog if I can help it.  The first day of filming for Low to the Net was accomplished on Saturday. After enjoying a excessively leisurely breakfast at Wah's, Travis, Andrew, and I filmed the opening sequence which involves my character waking up in the morning and going down to the beach to exercise, practice my ping-pong, and squash an unlikely opponent. We tied the ping-pong table to the roof and drove it down to the beach, setting it up along the water. Nobody seemed to have any big interest in that I was wearing a blonde wig, a head band, wrist bands, a neon-green shirt, and multi-neon colored running shorts. People these days are accustomed to Hollywood I guess. I even bought supplies from Home Depot and fashioned a crude rolling platform for the camera for panning shots. It was mildly successful, but with a few minor adjustments I think it'll work fine. We're going the extra mile with this project since it's a full movie and not a skit or 10 minute short, so I expect it'll take all summer to get this project done. We spent 4 or 5 hours yesterday working on the movie and the work we did will boil down to about 5 minutes of footage.   Katie had to work all weekend, so yesterday I spent the whole day by myself. It was refreshing and satisfying since school has not yet started so I had no responsibilities to worry about.

          Marcia Thompson Eldreth    Posted on www.uschristianflag.com guestbook by Ian Kristensen:    Shouldn't we be prouder to be Christians before being Americans? Obviously we're proud to be Americans, but there is no Lord besides our Lord and to say we're "American Christians" puts the emphasis and importance on the word "American". I would propose changing your slogan to "I am proud to be a Christian American." Our nation cannot come before our Savior and I pity all those who put their country before our Lord.  Yes, I know "American Christian puts the emphasis on Christian since it is the subject rather than the adjective, but it was the first thing I thought of.       Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:   Hi Ian:    I am receipt of your message and appreciate the respectful way you have presented your point.  A person would for sure be in spiritual trouble if they put their country before God.  Not the intent here and I know you recognized that.  Well, you know, I am getting ready to make web changes (don't come easy, computer deficit here and short on experts)  I can pray about the Christian American.  I believe that very well may be what needs said.    About the emphasis on country (eagle).  I was given that image while in prayer.  It was not a thought I authored.  Honestly, it wasn't.  God has affirmed many times that I have indeed heard correctly.  The message here, along with the scripture on the flag, Matthew 24:4&14, is that America was blessed by the God of the Bible in order that we could carry this great commission unto the uttermost parts of the earth.  I invite you to look in Zechariah 11 where the covenant staves (flags fly on staves) were given, they were called Beauty, which represents favor, blessings, abundance, food, etc. and Bands which represents strength, brotherhood, unity.  God has given me that message lest we forget why America was so blessed and through Him whom all blessings flow.   Today our nation is on a slippery slope,  i.e.  abortions, men marrying men, wicked shephards, 10 Commandments removed and so on.      He has called his sanctified ones, His army here in America to stand up and be good stewards of what He has given us.  This is "our" watch, we are responsible.    There should not be Muslim calls to prayer blasting 5 times a day in Michigan.         By reason of use, I have my spirit excercised to hear my Shepherds voice.    I do, however, take notice to the Christian American verses the other way and will take that before the LORD.  God bless you real good and thank you so much for your heart.  Sincerely, Marcia Thompson Eldreth  Also They are trying to rewrite history and remove our Christian Heritage....all lies from hell.  Are we in agreement to any of this?      Reply by Ian Kristensen:   Hi Marcia,   Thanks so much for replying!   Oh! I didn't realize that the Eagle came to you in a prayer. The Lord blessed this image for your flag? Perhaps you should state that on your site because now I feel foolish!   I agree wholeheartedly with you about the divine destiny of America and it's Christian purpose. Liberals today have poisoned our country with their lax morals. Why are people surprised America is so full of hatred and crime when sin is looked upon as acceptable? My personal belief, which doesn't fit today's politically correct, repressive climate is that this country was founded by White, Christian Men; not Muslims, Jewish people, Indians, Blacks, Gays, or anyone else.  I'm not saying these people don't deserve a fair chance in America, but we all need to recognize our founders' intent for this country. Christianity needs to be made America's official religion, English the official language, and anyone that doesn't like it can leave; it's a free country and nobody is forced to live here.   I have real concerns about the state of illegal immigration as well as legal immigration into American. It seems like America's true purpose is being dilluted more and more every day. Mexicans are pouring through our gates and stealing jobs that should go to Americans. Asians and Muslims are in every taxi and 7-11 from here to New York and who knows whether any of them are legally allowed to be here. Can you see a solution to any of this?   I am unclear on who you say is rewriting our Christian heritage, though it does seem common these days in all facets of American life.   Keep up the fight!   God Bless,  Ian Kristensen      Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:   Yes, God has divinely blessed it, many many affirmations. A hardly AMEN to the context of your message.   I have been saying that Christianity should be the declared America's official religion.  If we had that, then it would take care of the rest of the issues.   Well, God bless you and keep you and thank you.  It was nice visiting with you.     Marcia   Reply by Ian Kristensen:  Hi Marcia,   I double-checked your site and saw that you DID state the divine origin of your flag's design. I apologize for not checking the site more thoroughly.   You think if Christianity was declared America's official religion all its other problems would be solved? I'd love to hear more about this from you.   Sometimes I wonder though, if whether such a declaration would disrupt our nation's founding ideals of religious freedom. What do you think?   God Bless,   Ian       Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:   Don't pretend to know all of it.  Possibly.  The way I think it would solve the issues in court is:  How can you question the 10 Commandments, we are a Christian Nation,  or What do you mean to take our In God We Trust, we're a  Christian nation,  What do you mean men should be allowed to marry men, it is against the Bible.   Actually, it might cause a terrible legalistic approach instead of grace.  I will forward you a thought that I got from another fellow from flags of the world.   He had an interesting comment.    Thanks, Marcia

      Conservatives are trying to ban Michael Moore's new movie on grounds that it is breaking election laws as well as being bad for them. What happened to conservatives championing smaller government and less regulations?   Most Republicans are moral snakes, but you have to hand it to the ones who  urlLink stick it to their own  though; at least they're being consistent to their values. Most of them buckle on their moral ground once someone close to them gets Alzheimers (ahem), turns gay, or gets in trouble with the law.

          Rev. Sun Myung Moon, a rich businessman who leads his own invented relegion, was crowned as the new Messiah by Illinois congressman Danny Davis in a Senate building while members of congress watched on with squealish delight. George Bush Sr. and John Ashcroft are both strong supporters of Mr.Moon for his hard stance against homosexuality and premarital sex. Learn more about your new lord  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Mr. Moon also claimed endorsement from Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Hitler, who had all been reformed and reborn through his church's teachings - an idiosyncratic version of Christianity which rejects the use of the cross as a symbol and denounces homosexuals as "dirty dung-eating dogs".    "The head of the love organ is shaped exactly like a poisonous rattlesnake. And just like a rattlesnake, it's always looking for a hole." - Sun Myung Moon

      I am manning the "Hawaii's Temperature" game listening to tinny, faux-Hawiian music played over the office speakers while feeling an unescapable depression calling its way into my soul. I have had six pieces of that red tinged beef you dip in mustard hot sauce; two sugary, coconut spheres; two servings of a cilantro-ey noodle dish; and only one beer for fear of getting too tipsy and doing something innappropriate in front of the children. What is supposed to happen is every kid gets an activity booklet and they must walk about the office looking for paper suns dangling from the ceiling, which indicate that a game station is located near there. My game is helping the kids find the temperature in Hawaii on a computer connected to unrestricted internet access.  Unrestricted . There are children here here in their early teens and I'm supposed to let these kids on the internet? How am I supposed to control that unless I'm working the machine? What if they type "leather" instead of "weather" into Google? They might find a site on "tanning hide saddlery" for God's sakes, whatever the blast  that  is. Luckily I only have twenty-five minutes to go till I can run out of this place making high-pitched animal noises and then scream in the elevator the whole way down.

      Tonight my work is hosting an open house for the engineers, their wives, and their children to come see our office since the renovation, as well as check out fun engineering games like, "Structural Load Balance Beam" and "Complex Mathathon". Since most of our employees are bringing their children we're also hosting kiddy games of which I have been recruited to run. I have one forty-five minute shift on god-knows-what, but I relish the chance to experience the life of a carnie. The shame and loneliness; the mind-crushing repitition; the cabbage smell. It's all a bounty I plan to plunder.   Elliott Smith's last album, " urlLink From a Basement on the Hill ", will be released post-humously this fall.

      Terrorism has significantly increased since last year. We better keep Bush in office so he can continue takin' care of business. That guy is all walk.  Wal-mart is being sued by a gazillion female employees for sexual harassment. The Devil spoke out in Wal-Mart's defense,  "Wal-Mart carries my sinister biddings out with precision and ruthlessness. Damn all of you women-fakers to where I'm at."    Bush is aiming a new pro-marriage welfare plan at poor people to help them get married and stay that way. Say, how many poor, pregnant women are teenagers? Many. So, Bush wants children to start getting married. That sounds about right. Not to mention that none of the money that would be spent on this welfare reform is being added to the general welfare budget; it's being diverted from it. The money Bush wants to spend on pro-marriage plans would normally be used to help poor people  survive , but heck, having priorities are important.

      An engineer in South Africa has created a revolutionary engine that is capable of running entirely off of bananas. The engine produces no emissions, gets over seventy miles per gallon, and has two hundred horsepower, all while remaining cost-effective. "This will change every nation on the planet," said Membektu Alute, "The oil driven energy crisis will be eliminated as well as an enormous amount of the world's pollution issues." But, this holy grail of energy solutions has an Achilles foot...the problem? Monkeys keep eating the fuel.   Newborn llamas look like big, wet snakes when they come out.   Katie and I watched the first of Kubrick's Lolita last night and I liked it even better than the 1997 version. Older movies seem to be a lot more rooted in solid acting and writing than most current movies because they didn't have the options film makers today have for visually expressing themselves through cinematogrophy.   Low to the Net's script of done, notwithstanding a good polishing, but I imagine it'll change as we actually start filming. Andrew, Katie, and I went to Value Village on Saturday to complete the movie's wardrobe and we succeeded in getting Danny Letman, the lead character, albeit not the most entertaining of the bunch, and Pigboy's clothes, which will be a pair of jean shorts, a small, white t-shirt, and a nice snazzy, silk vest. We went to the costume store in Northgate afterwards and got wigs for Andrew and I's characters, Danny Letman and Bobby Johnson. I got a blonde, surfer-dude mop and Andrew got a semi-similar black wig that is a little more mussed up rockin'-style. Both Katie and Andrew were disturbed by how real the wigs looked on me; most of my friends have never seen me with hair, so bald is my normal state to them. I wore the wig for a while throughout the day hoping some stranger would make fun of me for wearing it and then I could pull it off and say I have cancer and make them feel terrible.   I'll start mailing out the first DVD in the "Beedrock Inc. Productions" series to my family soon, but I need to collect some addresses first. Hopefully I'll be able to mail them out before I take my trip to Alaska with Katie on 8/20. If Nikiski hasn't regressed into a Mad Max-like situation with bands of homeless road-pirates roaming the North Road on their patch-work instruments of vehicular mayhem, I'll be dearly dissapointed.

      John Kerry is proposing the national minimum wage be gradually raised to $7 an hour by 2007. A Bush administration official responded:  "John Kerry's platform has been based on pessimisms and lies and this is yet another another bipartisan attempt at politicizing a "hot button". American values do not support this wage-based charity."

      One of my new life goals is to get  urlLink Crossroads , circa 1986 starring Ralph Macchio, played in a movie theatre and I've been calling The Grand Illusion in the Univerity District to try to speak to whomever is in charge of programming.  urlLink The Grand Illusion  often plays kitschy movies late at night so I figured that would be my best best for getting Crossroads shown, but none of my calls have been returned so far. I've left three messages, each stating my name, number, and that I'd like to speak to whomever is in charge of programming and nothing. I left a message last week stating my name and number, that I'm NOT a salesman, but merely a civilian moviegoer with an interest in a certain movie theatre. Nothing again. These people are dicks and I plan on going down there in person to speak with someone.

           A Peek Into Engineering Banter    ENGINEER 1:  So, uh...heh...this guy walks in and says, "I just went to a job interview and nailed it." Heh.   ENGINEER 2:  Oh.  ENGINEER 1:  He walks into a meeting at the place he's working now.  ENGINEER 2:  (smiles) Oh yeah, that's a funny commercial. It's about banks being honest or something. What commercial is that? Is that Washington Mutual? My wife banks with Washington Mutual.  ENGINEER 1:  I think it's Washington Mutual.  Absolutely frightening. The most detestable person here is in administrative, but overall, the engineers lack social skills to a uncomfortable extent.   Tomorrow is the last day of my psychology class and I've done well in it, though not as much as I'd have liked. No matter how hard I study I can't seem to pull off higher than a high/low B+, which is annoying. Over the summer Katie and I are both taking the same online class in current environmental problems, which should be interesting. We'll be able to pool our efforts to keep our schoolwork minimal. I'm hoping to get "Low to the Net" filmed this summer and I'll need a lot of free time to accomplish that.   Southern Baptists voted down an internal proposal requesting that Baptists pull their children from "godless public schools" and either home-school them or enroll them in private, religious matriculation. I disagree with their vote; the best thing for this country would be for ideologues to have little to no formal education. This would limit their possibilities towards advancing in our society, though they might still be elected to a political position, but that's nothing new.   Also, the 9/11 panel study has show that there is no link between Iraq and al Qaeda. A Bush administration official commented saying, "Woops! I guess we flubbed up on that one! I'm real sorry about that you guys." Actually, they're doing what they're best at, which is admitting nothing and persisting in their fanciful and baseless claims about Iraq.

       LTTN, without MSG I am nothing, and K-Mart   While a good live show is important for a rock band, if your music sounds like a rhesus monkey getting its perineum shaved off with a dull butterknife, why buy the CD?  urlLink Mclusky  is by far your best bet if you plan on laying down $12 for a CD or a live show. I bought their new CD from  urlLink Easy Street Records  for $10 and their live show at the crocodile was only $13 after fees. The Von Bondies are charging $25 for their CD and $44.99 for a balcony seat at one of their shows. Get this: they only play arenas.   By the way, with the invent of the internet, there is no reason to buy music through huge chains anymore. Don't buy from Kmart, Sam Goody, or any of those large chains. If you  DO  happen to buy a CD, (a smaller percentage of people these days are doing this, including myself) buy it from an independent record store or through an online independent retailer. In America the only way to exert power is as a consumer, political activist, or businessman. Most of us aren't the latter two, so flex your tiny muscles and don't support assholes who molest their employees and destroy small business.   Low to the Net  is hanging over my head like a shadowy nimbus. Filming must begin soon. I need to finish the script and get it to the actors, but schoolwork and editing our finishing our old videos is taking up my time. I downloaded a fancy DVD authoring program which will allow me to make Beedrock Inc. Productions' first DVD of material a blithering success.

I'm not sure what benefits I or the strangers that might see my vehicular advertisement and then visit my blog would attain from this expanded readership, but  the more people that are aware I exist, the better .   I've got a knot in my back that is killing me and I'm  this  close to getting someone at work to  rub it out for me . The question is: Who?  I got back my peer reviews on my psychology presentation that was inspired by Andrew and more than one person wrote,  "Ralph Macchio Rules!"  on them. Two to be precise. I incorporated the Macchio's visage into the entertainment section of my presentation, which was displayed along with Father Time and Moses during the Q&A period.   To see how self-involved I am, take a look at how I start every paragraph. I, I, I. Can't my blog be about someone else  besides  me? I could be more emphatic and  write a blog for Carrie , but I'm afraid that once I got into character I might never escape.

           Van Gogh, The Eagles of Death Metal, and "Why Uni-directional Escalators are a Good Thing" by  urlLink Rem Koolhaas     Before going to the special exhibition of the "Van Gogh to Mondrian: Modern Art from the Kröller-Müller Museum" at  urlLink SAM  last night, Katie, Karen, and I strolled the echoic halls of the new Central Library. It's an impressive mouthful of building and I only have one gripe: from the second-to-top floor to the top floor there is only an up escalator, no down. The only way to go to another lower floor is by elevator, of which there are three, or stairs. The stairs are not intuitive, which is even more apparent by the taped up signs on the walls points to the "stairs" which turn out to consist partly of the buildings stairwells. I'm sure I'll get the hang of it once I explore the building more, but it's a pain for now. Otherwise I think the building is fantastic and not an eyesore at all. The EMP is great-looking too, even if it's less than useful or worth more than one trip.   Check out  urlLink The Eagles of Death Metal , a group consisting of Josh Homme, the tall lead singer from Queens of the Stone Age, and some other doofuses. Josh plays drums and doesn't even sing, so who cares if he's in the group. The band was inspired by the members sitting around wondering what the equivalent of  urlLink The Eagles , but in the genre of death metal would sound like. It turns out to be surprisingly toe-tapping.

      Last night Katie, Andrew, and I went to see " urlLink Super-Size Me ", a documentary about one brave man who ate only McDonalds food for an entire month, inspired by a court decision barring two morbidly obese, McDonalds-loving children from suing the food corporation because they could not prove their health was caused by McDonalds' food. Before he began his new diet he employed a handful of doctors, a nutritionist, and exercise analyzers to confirm and document that he was fantastic shape. He then ate three meals a day of McDonalds' food, sampling every item and super-sizing his meals only when asked.   By the end of the month he gained almost 40 pounds and nearly destroyed his liver, not to mention his cholesterol and overall health. One doctor was amazed because his liver was close to failing; he said that if the patient had been an alcoholic he would have told him if he didn't stop drinking he would die. Many of these doctors had set generous predictions as to how resilient the human body and that generally he would ok, but by the end of the month they were pleading with him to stop because his health was literally in serious danger.   The movie does a good job of researching the general eating practices of American's as well as American children, whose school lunches come dangerously close to resembling the healthfulness of a McDonald's meal. A poignant note was that the school where public school trouble-makers get transferred to offered a completely organic, healthy lunch menu at the equivalent cost of what most public schools offer and they saw amazing results in the kids' behaviors when fed good food low in sugar and fat. This is a movie every American that has eaten fast-food in the last year should see. For most people, fast-food falls into that ambiguous "bad" category, unburdened by actual numbers or meaning, but this movie will put into perspective just how dangerous fast-food can be for you.

          Andrew, Katie, and I went to see  urlLink Mclusky  at the Crocodile cafe last night. I'm sitting here drinking tea trying to repair the throat I messed up from breathing in second-hand cigarette smoke while shouting above the music trying to talk to Andrew about our idea for a band with the props and theatricalness (yes, it's a real word) of  urlLink Gwar , but based around the medieval ages and times or yore. We imagined a band where the singer was dressed like a wizard, the guitarist and bassist could be centaurs, and in the middle of the set a fantastic battle would ensue when a giant ogre (any tall, fat frat boy would do) stepped onto the stage and hurled a paper mache boulder about while the lead singer cast spells setting of pyrotechnics. This was all inspired by the first band that went on, The Standard, which was what I'd term a computer rock band, in that a main pillar of the music was a electronic based keyboard riffs, much like Grandaddy. The Standard's music was original and compelling, but the lead singer, who was a miniscule, bearded man, sang like a goat. His singing voice was filtered through the this goaty filter (imagine making a goat's "baa" sound) that made listening to him almost unbearable. It was one of those tortured artist type of things I believe, but as always, less is more. But those types always want to hit you over the head with their anguish and deep thoughts.   The next band was  urlLink Oceansize  and they sucked. I was intrigued by the lead singers confidant and devilish attitude, but they turned out to be another loud, heavy-metalish band trying to be artistic.   Mclusky, whose album "Mclusky do Dallas" we bought on vinyl in Canada and have enjoyed ever since, brought out the devil in the crowd, inspiring some guy to get into a fight within five minutes of them starting their show. Three unassuming twenty-something guys wearing "behavior monitor" shirts rushed him CIA style and dragged him out of the club, one on each arm and another performing a full-arm strangle hold on him from behind. Later, when we left the show, one of the glass front doors was smash, so I would assume he didn't go peacefully after they drug him out. Mclusky are what I'd call smart-art-punk, and luckily I didn't get that King County job at the government building downtown naming things because I'm terrible at it. They consist of a perfectly fine drummer and the lead singer, who plays guitar, and a strange looking bassist, who I thought was reminiscent of  urlLink Matthew McGrory . They switch between wild rock/punk songs with structure and melody, to wild rock songs with less structure and melody and they do it wonderfully. They pull off that messy, distorted punk rock that seems on the edge of falling completely apart into discord, but manages to waver on that line and keep a distinct melody, bass line, and usually two catchy guitar riffs cohesive. Andy Falkous sings in a shout in a talking/singing style much like that back-up singer in the B-52's, but he jumps between his shout-singing, actual singing, and yelps that surprisingly sounded good to me. I'm not usually a fan of bands that could be described this way, but Mclusky manage to keep their sound coherent, out-of-control, and catchy all at once.

          The Deja Vu, a strip club we went to for Tim's bachelor party last Friday, was on a completely different planet compared to The Sands. Both were sleazy, degrading globes for sure, but millions of miles apart. Spending an hour at The Sands felt like getting a personal tour of a homeless person’s life. It left me disturbed and depressed. The Deja Vu was more like taking a stroll through skid row after the government bulldozed all the poor people out and painted all the buildings, leaving the streets empty. It was disturbing and unsettling, but on a different level.   The Deja Vu was clean looking, open, and fairly full of twenty-something males of varying aesthetic respectability. The main room had a stage and pole against the far, mirrored wall; all the chairs and tables faced towards the stage and lining the perimeter of the room were semi-private booths reserved for $20 lap dances. I was the last one to pay at the entrance and lost sight of my friends as I walked into the dark club. I nervously hugged the back wall and paced back and forth looking for them until I spotted the bathroom and escaped inside. After I needlessly went to the bathroom I snuck back out and was asked by a wandering stripper if I wanted a lap dance to which I replied meekly that no, I was just trying to find my friends. Andrew, who was seated with the rest of the gang directly in front of the stage, waved and I sat down by them.   Different states have different rules for strip clubs. Washington's deem that if a club allows the girls to get completely nude, no alcohol may be served there. Conversely, if they keep some clothing on they can pour the booze freely, which I would much prefer. Andrew ordered a coke from the waitress and I did the same. When she came back with our orders she wouldn’t tell me how much the drinks were; she rambled and alluded to how fun the club with and how pretty the girls were, so I assumed the Déjà vu worked like The Sands, where there was a minimum drink limit, and I gave her five bucks. After she left Andrew told me the first drink was covered by our entrance fee. Sadly enough, I could have had a group of strippers clawing at my legs for that fiver, not that that appeals to me, but it’s nice to have power.   I was startled by the nudity at first. While no one can argue that a nice pair of breasts are not inherently aesthetic, neither the male or female genitals are conducive to being paraded around on a stage. At least girls' sex organs are internal and have an unassuming container, namely, the pelvis; although, much to my dismay, those strippers tried their best to make their sexual organs visible. I’ve never seen a cervix first-hand, so I couldn’t confirm what it was I was viewing. Also, the girls' acrobatics were much more impressive than The Sands. They whipped around those poles with a fury, almost taking my and Andrews' eyes since we were seated so close. It’s hard for me to imagine a male strip club being arousing because, while I can appreciate a fit person who looks good, the male sex organs are ridiculous as a seductive aide when in either of it's states.   While the on-stage nudity and performances were startling, what was more unsettling was the aggressiveness that the girls in the club try to squeeze money out of you. In most places the performers on stage are paying to be there; the way they make money is through tips and lap dances, which they will actively accost you for. Within a couple minutes of when I first sat down I had more than one girl lean over my shoulder, ask how I was doin', and try to convince me to get a lap dance from them. One girl even clumsily complimented me on my hat, though she was only grasping for flirtatious straws to warm my wallet up. A pair of breasts attacked Andrew’s shoulder while their owner tried to seduce him into giving her money for flopping around on his lap, which is extremely satisfying, I’m sure.  Throughout the entire strip club an unbodied, male DJ's voice shouted announcements over the comprehensive PA system. It would exclaim how sexy the girl on stage was and "let's hear it for Krystal!" The most entertaining thing it instigated was getting all the girls in the club to stand up on stage all at once. "That's a lot of confused young ladies," Andrew muttered to me, and I would be prone to agree. It was impressive how many ladies were working at one time; there must have been around 20-30 of them up on stage. Each in their own almost non-existent outfit, they reluctantly stood on stage and attempted half-hearted smiles and uninspired poses. The announcer prompted the male crowd to yell, "Hell yeah!" on his count of three and then allowed the ladies to disperse. It was overwhelmingly underwhelming.  What smacked most of a brothel was the shower show. A nondescript man with a black pony tail and leather coat appeared at the end of a girl’s show and shined a flashlight into the crowd as our DJ friend announced that the lady who just performed would be doing a shower show in the back room, so into the back we went. The room was a mirror image of the front except it had a shower stall built into the back corner. It had walls to chest height and seating around a raised grating framed by mirrored backing with various showers attachment protruding from them. This pony-tailed guy followed us back there and adopted the roll of pimp as he expounded on the girl's attractiveness, the rules for the show (hold up a $5 bill and get a DVD, hold up a $10 and get something even better). The nude girl stood atop the grated stage and sprayed herself down briefly and then was handed a bottle of shaving cream by the leathered pimp. Betraying the intent of the item she merely rubbed the cream over various sections of her body while her pimp shouted that this was her first shower show and "we're getting a real treat here". He then took the shaving cream and sprayed it down on the thin bar tables where the hooting patrons could lay dollars on and she’d pick them up with her chest or even her butt, which never stuck me as a very versatile body part for grasping, but seemed to work adequately.   While The Sands merely made me feel sorry for strippers, the Déjà vu confirmed my previously unbased suspicions that strippers are merely soft-core prostitutes. They  aren’t  just dancing and it’s  not  just another job, as proponents of stripping might argue. A stripper's job is to actively and aggressively sell their body and sex to customers. Sexual intercourse does not need to take place to take the job over that invisible line that separates prostitutes and, what some might encouragingly term performers. To earn money these girls depend on using not only their body, but their minds to manipulate sleazy men into giving them their money. The definition of prostitue is 1)one who solicits and accepts payment for sex acts and 2)one who sells one's abilities, talent, or name for an unworthy purpose. Either of those definitions are applicable. Sadly, the girls couldn’t hide the distaste they held for their jobs anymore than I could. As I watched them work, the girls' inviting expressions would instantly fall off their faces as they turned away from unconvinced Johns and searched the room for another sale.

          Last night after Katie and I got home from School I decided to limit the places Bojee can hide in. She’s a sweet, nice cat, but is skittish and prone to tucking herself away in a corner or under something. She’s made under or on top of our bed her regular hiding place so I drug her out and shut the door. Bojee, startled to be unearthed from her burrowed hole, ran into the kitchen and crouched, alarmed, by the window. I was feeling a bit kooky so I slowly started crawling into the kitchen on all fours calling Bojee’s name and generally being unsettling, but not too frightening. She had nowhere to run since there was no room to get by me and I wanted to see what she’d do. I assumed she had no venues of escape, but as I got closer to her she surprised me by jumping up onto the kitchen counter. I picked up Monkey who was playing with my feet and I stood up. Bojee then bolted out through the opening leading into the living room and in the process knocked over our sorted-mailboxes which crashed against the wine flutes we had set next to the sink sending mail and broken glass into the wet sink as well as all over the kitchen floor. Katie and I laughed because we knew the whole thing was my fault. Then I threw Bojee in the bathtub and turned on the shower.

      Album length does not matter as long as it feels right. There are many classic albums that are only a half-hour long.  An album's optimal number of tracks is ten; nine or less is an embarrassment and anymore than ten begins to feel drawn out and like padding, even if every song is gold.   Track number seven should always be the best song on the album.   Never put your hit single first unless the rest of your album can back it up.   Don't divide an album's tracks by musical style.   Remember: if you do any time traveling, don't make contact with your future/past self; nothing good ever comes of it.

      I don't understand this. Who is confused as to whether American's support their troops? I haven't met one person that says, "It's the troops! They're doing the wrong thing and they know better! They should come home." Obviously, it's not their decision or their job to decide where they go; politicians get to tell them where to go and what to do.   Because people vehemently disagree with the war on terrorism, the war in Iraq, and any other warfare our President decides to create, doesn't mean we think it's the troops' fault. They have no say in it.

Seriously though, if you disapprove of Clinton for moral reasons (which is the only way you could considering how well he ran this country) then how in the world can you approve of George W.? He's done so much weasling and blatant lying about his past he's at least Clinton's equal. More so if you consider Bush has a whole graveyard of skeletons in his closet; Clinton, only a couple. George Bush was convicted of a DUI; he could have easily caused an accident and killed some kids.

      All of you who don't give  blood  and don't have good reasons should be ashamed of yourselves. Here are some reasons why.   60% of the U.S. population is eligible to donate blood only 5% do. Why?  Because they are jerks.    Three: the number of lives saved by one pint of donated blood. Think about  that  next time you don't give blood because you "don't have time for it."   4.5 million: the number of American lives saved each year by blood transfusions. So stop being so selfish, you non-blood giving wanker!

          Uck. I went to my dentist's office over lunch to get a filling repaired. He did it for free since he put in the filling only a couple months ago, but it is not a pleasant experience. Especially when the nurse gave me a shot and then after prodding my palate asked if I could feel anything, which I did. She wondered aloud about getting a booster shot for the roof of my mouth, then the dentist came in and started drilling, so I was sitting there gripping my wrists waiting for that sharp spike of pain to shoot through my head, though it never did.   My dentist is unusually hip and has all sorts of cool art and music in his office, but in the roof where he treated me was a tall rectangular painting; the whole thing was painted a flat, dull red and there was text in black lettering, which had also been painted over in red so it was barely visible, in the middle which said, "I fill your pain". Too dark? I think so. I get the significance of it in a dentist's office, but c'mon. I thought his black leather head mask was a bit much as well.

          Issac Asimov (1920-1992)   Issac Asimov, the prolific science fiction writer who died in 1992 of complications after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion during heart surgery, would have been horrified by Will Smith's new wank-off thriller, "I, Robot", which is loosely (we're talking prostitute level) based on Asimov's story of the same name. Asimov was devoted to removing humanity's fear of advanced robotics and now they turn a story of his into a action movie where robots go crazy and try to kill everyone. Way to defecate on his grave, Smith! He IS hunky though, so I'll let slide. Oh, my heart is aflutter!

      If you haven't heard.  urlLink Moveon.org  is suing Fox News because of their motto, "fair and unbiased" reporting, which has been proven to be the opposite of the case by numerous journalism studies of their reports.  Moveon.org recently released video of a Fox News correspondent, Carl Cameron, in a pre-interview with Bush which shows just how ass-kissy he can get. Remember: Journalists are severely punished or fired for showing conflicts of interest, such as displaying any partisan behavior. The San Francisco Chronicle put its letters editor on leave for contributing $400 to the Kerry campaign. In 2000, a CNN producer whose husband was a lawyer for Gore was told not to have anything to do with campaign coverage. And yet, Cameron persists....  View the video  urlLink here .

      A recent analysis of the Bush and Kerry squads based on their voting records have shown that though Kerry is indeed left of the Democrat's, Bush is equally right of the Republicans and Dick Cheney outpasses both of them as the most right.  In his latest demonstration of how nuts he is Cheney recently declared that terrorism can not be diplomatically dealt with and that America "must vanquish" this enemy, in other words, the Iraqistani's or "bearded ones". Cheney has also recently stated that terrorist attacks "are invited by the perception of weakness." Basically our war is all about finding the bad guys (I'm not sure the criteria for being a "bad guy", but I'm betting it is anyone who appears hostile (psst...which is most everyone, understandably)) and murdering them all.   Cheney illustrates perfectly why the war on Terrorism has been a failure and will continue to be; terrorism originating in the Middle East is not a product of a small group of people that are psychotic or mentally ill. They are an extreme group of strongly religious people that base their hatred of the U.S. on their religion and American foreign policy. It is a war of ideologies, which is my "Important Word of the Year", and that is why we can never "vanquish" the enemy. Thy are not a finite group of people, but a collection of people the U.S. has seriously pissed off by being an international asshole over the decades.  As a recent study on terrorism has shown, terrorism has gone up since Bush started his war. What do you think happens when you declare war on what is basically a geographical region of feverently religious people who idolize martyrs and already don't care for the U.S.? Destroying their messed-up, yet stable government, and killing 10,000 innocent civilians will only embolden and inspire terrorism.

      Florida electronic voting machines used in local elections have already malfunctioned and erased votes. Florida Governor Jeb Bush will not allow an independent counsel to examine and test the machines for security issues because he has "every confidence" in the machines and their manufactures. One major producer of the voting machines recently apologized for stating his full support for Bush, afterwards realizing it doesn't look so good.  Don't be surprised when the next election get's stolen too. Florida list of felon's that are not allowed to vote have already been recreated and dumped because they were found to contain a huge amount of legal Black voters' names. Barely 1% of the names on the list were of Hispanics, who consistently vote Republican in Florida.

      To help surgeons practice their skills, Army soldiers are eligible to get breast implants as well as many other forms of plastic surgery for free.  Between 2000 and 2003, military doctors performed 496 breast enlargements and 1,361 liposuction surgeries on soldiers and their dependents.  I'm offended that my tax dollars pay for some Army girl to get breast enlargements and then go get blown up in Iraq. It add a tart and inappropriate layer to this already freakishly flavored war-cake.

      I am extremely concerned about the use of electronic voting machines in the upcoming Presidential elections; the machines have been proven to be easily tampered with as well as owned by Republican supporters.

      Who could have seen this one coming? I thought Bush would be finally be satisfied after destroying Afghanistan and Iraq as well as murdering thousands of their innocent citizens, but it turns out he needs one more fix. Just one more.   Even though the CIA has found "no direct connection between Iran and the attacks of Sept.11", Bush stated he wanted to "continue to look and see if the Iranians were involved" Does this sound familiar?   "I have long expressed my concerns about Iran. After all, it is a totalitarian society where free people are not allowed to exercise their rights as human beings. I have been concerned about Iran ever since I have been president."  - Bush  Bush's lack of grammar skills shows me he's a real person that understands real problems. I like the cut of his jib.

      Sex toys can only be sold in Texas as long as they are advertised as novelty items and the item's correct use is not described. I'm predicting a rash of vibrator related deaths in Texas because these poor, unfulfilled girls used the vibrating, artificial penis incorrectly.   If I ever go to Texas I'll wear my hat on my feet and my shoes on my head...and then I'll get beat up for being a "shoe-hat wearing queer".

      Portrait of    urlLink "Suicide Moe"     Click the above link for a portrait by Jenny Oakley, a local artist, of a Ballard cat, "Suicide Moe". Katie and I found Moe when we were walking around the streets by our Ballard apartment. Moe was lazily walking about and we stopped for a minute to pet him and then continued on down the sidewalk. When we got about thirty feet farther down the sidewalk we stopped next to a telephone pole and looked back at Moe who abruptly starting galloping like a small horse straight for the telephone pole and started using the pole as a scratching post.  It was such a bizarre gait for a cat, let alone one as squat and thick as Moe, I had to see it again, so I walked him back to where he had been and then I returned to the pole and got his attention. Once he saw me he did his weird pony run over and scratched on the post exactly as he had before. I got Moe to do this at least four or five more time in exactly the same way, so it must have been a routine for him.    urlLink Andrew , this is the perfect chance to get a portrait of Calvin dressed up as Napoleon. For a larger, quality painted portrait Jenny's prices are pretty good, though perhaps not in the budget of a college kid with an alarming cough syrup habit such as yourself.

          Martha Stewart has been sentence to five months in jail and will be fined $30,000 for her insider sale of ImClone Systems stock. She won't serve her sentence for at least nine months to await her appeal, which makes no sense.   Ms. Stewart was also sentenced to serve five months of home confinement and two years of supervised probation after she is released. She stood to profit approx. $42,000 from her illegal stock manipulation.    "What was a small personal matter became, over the last two years, an almost fatal circus of unprecedented proportion," said Stewart. "I'll get you all!" She screamed, shaking her fist as she flew off into the sky, her&nbsp;rusty, mechanical glider leaving an ominous, trail of black smoke in her wake.

      This is what we've come to under Bush: an administration who has created a division of government in charge of keeping the public fearful. Under the pretense that they are 'just letting us know', Bush officials appear at opportune times to say, "Hey! Terrorists are afoot! You're all in danger!" What better way to pull the nation's attention towards fear and Bush's supposed war against it.   If you are shocked now, just wait for election time.

          The scariest part about having an out of control ideologue for a president isn't what he can do while in office, it's what is left over after he leaves. One of a president's greatest powers is the appointment of judges who will carry out their personal agendas in court. Appointing a justice to the Supreme Court is the best way for a president to ensure his ideology is carried out after his term, since Supreme Court Justice's terms are for life.    George Bush. Jr. has appointed J. Leon Holmes to the federal bench in Arkansas. While this is only a district court seat and there is little possibility of Mr. Holmes exerting much change outside of his realm of authority, Mr.Bush's choice for this position illustrates the shocking danger American is in if he manages to appoint similar choices to the Supreme Court.   To learn more about Mr. J. Leon Holmes and read some of his shocking statements about abortion, rape, women, and homosexuals, click this post's title or  urlLink here .

       REPLY by Liberal    Also, a couple more things to research and consider on your own:   Bush is fighting a war on terrorism. Bush heavily supports the use of fossil fuels over establishing renewable energies as a fuel source. Because of his energy policies, American is by FAR the largest consumer of fossil fuels (oil) in the world. Where does the U.S. get it's oil? Countries in the Middle-East like Saudi Arabia who have state-sponsored terrorism (research that if you don't believe me). Breaking all of that down simply results in this: George Bush's energy policies, which are heavily supported by the majority of Republicans,  have made American the largest funder of terrorism in the world.   Another tidbit is this: Bush has raised our national debt to the highest it's ever been (even after being given a huge budget surplus). This debt is REAL debt; it's not some vague number that means nothing like Cheney believes. So, where does the money the government use to buy everything come from if we have such a large debt? The answer is foreigners. Republicans are selling off American land, businesses, and anything else they can to foreigners to get the money our government uses. Do you think this is a good thing? Do you think this fits in with George Bush's foreign policies?  Ian    REPLY by Conservative    And isn't it true the only reason we can't tap the incredible oil  sources that are located IN this country (Texas, for example) is because  the leftist environmentalist wackos won't let us, and have passed laws  forbidding the refining here? Where are we to go for oil?   Bush had a surplus and cut taxes, because, as Reaganomics proves, a  lower tax rate can create higher revenues for the government. It's an  economic principle I am familiar with -- I can draw the graph for you.  Then, September 11th happened. No one could be prepared for that. The  onslaught that came afterwards has put us into debt. Looking back, the  war was a mistake. Bush was given incorrect information that he acted on  in the best way he knew how. He had to protect us from another terrorist  attack, which even now they are saying could still happen. You may not  believe al-Qaida and Saddam and North Korea are linked, but I see the  same evil in all of them. I don't support going to war, it sucks. My  friend who works at KPFF went to Cornell with Nick Berg. We talked about  the war once, and she started crying. War hurts -- but I believe it  makes us stronger. We are not weaker because of this, terrorism is. Like  I told Gilbert, and I don't know if you heard this or not, but the Iraqi  Interim President and some civilians (I believe), in conjunction with  the handover, held a press conference at the beginning of the week  thanking the Bush administration for the risk it took liberating Iraq  and the lives it sacrificed. Only one media outlet, FoxNews if I am  correct, covered the press conference. No one else did. No one else  wanted to see Bush get any CREDIT for the war. We can't THANK him, that  would be preposterous! Those doing the thanking had to take out -- pay  for -- a full page AD in USA Today to get their message across. No  reporters would write the story.   Some media is right and some media is left. You oppose the war, I  support the president (for other reasons we haven't even got in to). We  think differently, and I can live with that. I realize nothing I say can  change your mind, and nothing you say can change mine.  I agree we need  to get as much information as we can, but where are we to get NEUTRAL  information from? It's a matter of deciding your news source. Are we  going to be pessimistic about what's happening, or look to the future  and accent the positives? The war happened -- it's over by the way, we  won -- but struggles still occur.  All the struggles that HAVEN'T  HAPPENED because of Bush or anyone else for that matter, we can't  complain about, can we? Nor can the "optimist" hoot and holler that  "hey, we prevented something!" Who's to know what could have happened.   Anyway, it's interesting to talk about this, but I don't think it's good  for us to get all fired up inside at work. I appreciate your questions,  but I don't feel I'm in any position to debate.   The minority,  Conservative    REPLY by Liberal    You're missing the point. Oil is not the only energy source around; it's merely the cheapest to tap, that is, if you disregard the costs of public health, pollution, and damage to our environments by using fossil fuels. Did you know even if we ravaged the entire American wilderness and sucked up every last bit of oil in the U.S. we would only be able to use that oil to sustain our use for at MOST 30 years. Where do we go after that? The vast majority of oil is located in the Middle East. The point is that oil is NON-renewable. We are going to run out of it at our current rate of use within our lifetimes, even if we tapped every oil well in the world. Instead of investing and promoting other renewable energies and thereby strengthening the U.S. in the long-term, Bush is bent on using up all our non-renewable energy as quickly as possible without regard for the environment, pollution, or public health, which the use of fossil- fuels significantly effect.   Our current debt is not because of 9/11. It is because Bush used that surplus to give an enormous tax cut to the ultra- wealthy (his professed political base), because he started a war that is costing billions, and because he cut taxes.   Do you agree with Reagan's view that making the wealthy wealthier benefits the poor because it will "trickle-down"? That is exactly what Bush is doing, just like Reagan did and history has proven that it does NOT work.   On a side-note, what is your opinion on strict, longer jail sentences and the death sentence? Bush is famous for his love of the death penalty and he executed more prisoners than any other souvenir in history, but studies have conclusively and repeated shown that the death penalty and stricter prison terms for crime does NOT deter crime. Do you support his policy on this issue?   Why do you think what we're doing hurts terrorism? The effect of Bush's foreign policy and war in Iraq and Afghanistan has only destabilized the countries making it possible for terrorism to flourish. Statistics show since Bush started his war on Terrorism, terrorism has significantly gone UP. His war is not working. How do you explain this?   What is this common evil you see in North Korea and al-Qaida?   Have you considered that the reason no one (in the world) is thanking Bush for the war is because it's a bad thing and Bush messed it up? Why do you think he had to force the U.S. to start this war alone? Go look at a list of Bush's supposed supporter of the war. You'll be amazed at the countries on that list as well as the actual amount of support they've given to the war. Specialty groups put out full page ads in the major newspapers all the time; it's not an extreme thing to do, as if all the liberals were trying to shut those joyful Iraqis up. Take a look at polls done regarding Iraqi's and their opinion of Bush and the war. The majority of them don't support Bush, the war, or the  occupation. At most they admit that they are glad Saddam is gone, but those who profess that also say they are in worse shape then they were in before. I haven't heard you comment on the number of Iraqi civilians (10,000) that have died in the war. Do you consider that an acceptable number? It doesn't seem large for a war that is supposed to be helping the Iraqi population?   How can you say the war is over and we won? What do you base this on? Are basing this on the same info that led Bush to declare "all major combat has ended"? "Mission accomplished"? More than 700 U.S. soldiers have died since he publicly stated those two phrases.   You might have a hard time changing my mind about Bush, but the feeling I get from what you've said is that you haven't heavily researched what Bush has done in office, in America and overseas. It sounds like most of the sources you get news from are heavily biased and that you're just voting for your team. I don't just naturally disagree with conservatives and side with liberals; I get informed and make my own decision with listening to extremists voice their own wild agendas. You might feel like conservatives are being unfairly ganged up on right now, but look at world  opinion polls. The majority of the WORLD doesn't agree with what Bush is doing or has done. It isn't logical to dismiss the rest of the world as a bunch of wacko liberals; so that only leaves the option that there is a good amount of sense to what everyone is saying. Taking a defensive position against what you discern as a liberal agenda will only hurt yourself and your ability to form your own opinion about what is happening right now.   Don't worry about talking about politics at work. I'm not judging you or getting angry; I enjoy talking politics because it is important to do so.  Ian    Additional REPLY to coworker by Conservative:    That's so funny you ask that!!  The DUI and the drug use is a big reason I support Bush. People make mistakes and do stupid illegal things, but it takes a strong person to realize he doesn't have control of his life and take the responsible steps to stop it. Did you know George Bush doesn't drink alcohol at all? He had problems (obviously a DUI, which he has lived up to) and knows his limits and what it does to him, so he avoids it. That to me is a strength I greatly respect.    I think Rush makes some good points. He's not my favorite person, but I enjoy listening to him. He makes things seem like such common sense. I'm a traditional conservative person -- I believe in responsibility, keeping yourself out of trouble, paying your own health care, not sucking off the government and doing it for yourself. I like what Rush says, because he thinks the same way. I hadn't heard the "frat boy pranks" thing, but my thought is, and I haven't gotten this from anyone but me, that yes it was wrong, but they would have done the same thing to us. I don't support it, but I accept that it happened and I would have only assumed something like it would happen. It's the world we live in. Does that mean Donald Rumsfeld was ok in keeping the info to himself and letting it slide? No.    I remember during Hurricane Isabel watching FoxNews (I was glued to the TV, seeing how I'm from MD and love the OBX) and absolutely HATING this one blonde bushy haired squeaky voiced reporter. She was so annoying!  It left a sour taste in my mouth regarding FoxNews. I do read the NyTimes headlines, yahoo headlines, and the Seattle Times. I'm more of a written article girl than a broadcast journalism girl. Broadcast is all about the disturbing image... writing is a talent. That's just my opinion.    Anyway :-)  Conservative

          Marcia Thompson Eldreth    Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:    Oh I suppose I could elaborate more.  People who are mentally ill or perhaps  even demon possessed would expect to hear things like to kill someone or run  your car off of a cliff or other very destructive things that is not at all  in alignment with the Bible.   I could write a book (and may) on the extraordinary events that have been  total affirmations.  Actually history is being made this very week in  regards to the flag.  After the event I wouldn't mind sharing with you the  awesome coordination of Father God to have it come about.  I am sure you  will find it very interesting.  Because of the safety of people involved I  do not really want to elaborate now.  Remind me if I forget.   Also all through history there have been people who have indeed heard from  God and have had the courage and faith to walk it out in obedience.   I do  not think anyone thought that they were bipolar or clinically mentally ill.  Just foolish.  But then wisdom is born of her children.  In other words,  when all is said and done, how did it all turn out?  If it birthed God's  will then you had the wisdom of God.  I do not doubt in the dark what God  has shown me in the light.  Sometimes it takes quite awhile to see it all  manifest.   Think of how long Noah built an ark.  People might of thought of  him as certainly foolish, Moses in the wilderness going around the same  mountain for 40 years.  Well this could go on and on.  I do have a sound  mind.   Do you pray much?   Do you have a prayer need that I can pray along with you?  Marcia    Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:    Gracious, it just occurred to me that you might think I mean that I hear  voices...not so...a quickening in my spirit with a message, not an audible  voice.  Actually the eagle/cross was probably (I'm thinking) the first time  I got a vivid vision with my eyes closed and was in prayer.  The way it came  at me was "whoom" there it was in direct, prompt answer to "LORD this is  your flag, what do you want on it."   I hope this helps you.    Reply by Ian Kristensen:    Hi Marcia,   Thanks for replying!   Why do you believe the symptoms of mental illness, which is an amazingly broad term including everything from depression to schizophrenia, are violent and destructive? To think that all, or even most psychopaths (note the specific term) experience a literal, internal voice instructing them do things would be incorrect. Some mental illness's symptoms include a internal dialogue separate from their own, but it is not the rule. How do you explain this in regard to differentiating mental illness from God's work?     You think that even if someone is exhibiting characteristics of a mental illness, which Noah inarguably was by current medical standards, they should be left alone because they might be carrying out God's will? How does this apply to recent, non-biblical history? God is known to work in mysterious, sometimes contrary ways; what would your justification be for theoretically condemning the seemingly immoral actions of a person living today if history reveals  their actions resulted in a significant contribution to Christianity, which you say is a sufficient proof that they were doing God's work?   I think if you spoke to someone extensively learned in psychology, they might be able to clarify this "quickening of spirit" you've experienced, rather that automatically attributing it to God.How do you differentiate the "flash" of inspiration artist's experience, which is simply a product of their creative minds, to what you experienced?   Ian   Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:    I really do not know for sure what psychopaths experience.  Just personally  knew one young man that kept hearing voices, he said, they said to kill his  wife and daughter.  He kept going to the VA and different places for help.  One day he indeed did that and later hung hisself in prison.  The result was  all three were dead, clearly not of God.  You ask me questions that you  must know more about than I do.  That is clearly OK by me for you to know  that.      However, Christ did say that He is the good shepherd and his sheep knows  His voice.   When I step out in faith and obedience, it comes to fruition,  that which he told me and then He blesses it exceedingly above and beyond  anything I could ever hope for or imagine...which is exactly what He said in  the Bible He would do for those who trust Him and are the called according  to His purposes.       The Bible does say He works in mysterious ways but I do not believe it  says He works in contrary ways.  Christ was given all authority both in  Heaven and on earth.  The terrestrial realm of authority was given to His  saints.  He is the head, we are the body.  The body always (when well) does  what the head tells it to do.      Now what we see as contrary to anything as put forth in the Bible, which  is my authority, is not of God.  But all things were made by God for God so  what Satan means for evil, God can and sometimes does turn around for good.  When I was born from above (second birth) I received the Spirit of God  inside me to dwell.  Why would I ever want to go to a flesh and blood human  being to see if he or she could convince me that I do not have "the spirit  of Truth"?  Why would I pay someone to try and rob me of my blood born  right?  I won't.  I do not need man's explanation of what is going on  inside of me.  I KNOW because it has borne good fruit.  A tree  is known by  it's fruit.       When the Romans nailed Christ to the cross, Satan thought he had won!!  Uh oh.... So did the Roman's soldiers work in behalf of God?  What Satan  meant for evil God will turn for good.  Christ paid a debt that He did not  owe because I owed a debt that I could not pay.   I gladly receive his gift.  I am bought with a price and am not my own.  He has been to me my savior,  LORD, redeemer, provider, healer, teacher, comforter, friend...I have years  of accumulated testimony and much prophesy has already been fulfilled that  was written in the old testament.   Just as sure as He came the first time  He will come again.  Take heed that no man deceive you......not even the  learned in psychology.  If the Roman soldiers were working for God, they  would be blessed by God for it.  Indeed, they did not work for Him.  One was  saved at the foot of the cross when he repented.          Got to get on with my tasks at hand for the day.  You have had  experiences that I know not of etc.  I am just a woman who loves my LORD.  Right now I am the "flag lady" (ha) not a psychologist.  Any prayer  requests?          God be with you, Marcia                                   God Bless, Marcia    Reply by Ian Kristensen:    Hi Marcia!   As in Noah's case, you seem to hold that people should be left to their own since we can't know whether they are mentally ill or actually doing God's work. You also say that you "just know" that it is God speaking to you. I think you can see the problem with that logic as well as I can.   God works in mysterious ways, i.e. in ways we cannot possibly comprehend, which is the point of that verse. As you said, Noah's could have easily been construed as sinful. Instead of wasting vast resources and his own precious time, which he could have used to help people, he built a big boat. Only after the fact did we see his work was God's. As you pointed out, there is no way of knowing whether something is truly a holy act till we can view the big picture, that is, history. Since this is impossible for us to do now, how can you judge something as not God's work? You cannot  come close to comprehending God's intellect through a book, so how can you dare to so?   Ian   Reply by Marcia Thompson Eldreth:    Yes, Ian, how dare I to speak of what I believe to be true and correct just  because it has borne much fruit and is alignment with the Holy scriptures?  Pretty stupid of me I guess.  Isn't America a great country?   Back to the original reply you gave me.  I said a hearty Amen to all that  you said but one part has haunted me, the part about the white man.  I do  not think much on those lines about the color.   So if I may, I retract the  Amen in regards to the white men.  I still say so to the rest.   My entire foundation is based on the Holy scriptures.  It works.  Bottom  line, what is your point??  What are you trying to accomplish here?  What is  your agenda?   I have free heartedly extended to you what I have to offer  out of a pure heart and intent.   If I cannot help you then I must go do  something else.   I will no longer do vain debates as I do have a full  agenda.   Your presumptions of me are in error.  The deal with precious resources,  they are made by God for God.  One huge precious resource we have is time.  Are we being good stewards of it???   I don't think so.  Marcia    Reply by Ian Kristensen:    Hi Marcia!   You misunderstand, I'm only playing devil's advocate. These are all questions to be asked and you should be able to answer them. It can only make your faith stronger Marcia. How can you truly fight the Devil if you haven't explored your own beliefs? My preacher always says, "an immature faith in God is as sinful as a mature alliance with the Devil." Do you see the wisdom in that?   What part about the white man did you disagree with and why?   Perhaps we are doing God's work, as Noah was. You might think we are being foolish or sinful by wasting our time discussing these topics as he did wasting time building a boat, but in the end I think you'll see we're doing God's work!   Ian   I'm afraid that is the last I might hear from Marcia. She's a sweetheart of a woman, but as confused as an eighteen-year-old stripper.

Solitary confinement in an American jail has not been good to him.   urlLink BitTorrent  was mentioned in a CNN.com story on "Fahrenheit 9/11"  urlLink here . I was hoping it'd stay off the public's radar longer than this.  Has anyone forgotten that Bush was a cokehead and a drunk driver? I think the answer is: Everyone. The sad thing is his past crimes look disregardable compared to 10,000 dead civilian Iraqis.  The  urlLink Elliott Smith Memorial Fund  donates all proceeds to victims of abuse. Elliott's death is still not confirmed as either a suicide or murder.

       There no facts or laws that scientists claim are 100% true and will always be 100% true.  When something is stated as a law or rule this means all current evidence and research points towards the probability of it being true as very high. This does not preclude the rule changing or being replaced with a new, updated rule based on new evidence. When rules/laws are changed this doesn't mean science is somehow wrong; it is doing exactly what it was designed to do.    The scientific method is dubbed so because it follows a purely logical train of thought to test and eliminate all incorrect options till the correct answer is found.  It's an intelligent algorithm. It's silly to discount this method of solving problems simply because it contains the word scientific.

       A 1-hour ride on a jet ski creates more air pollution that the average U.S. car does in a year.   This is beacuse emissions from a two-cycle gasoline engine, like a jet ski, lawn mower, leaf blower, chain saw, boat engine, or outboard motor uses are not regulated strictly as of yet.

      Last night the gang and I, minus Carrie who was working, went to the Barking Dog in Ballard last night to partake of some mead and lamb shanks. I had the meatloaf burger, as did Travis, but I opted for the interest-peaking side-order substitution of tofu fries and they were delicious, if you like fried tofu to begin with. They're merely long, thick strips of marinated and fried tofu and they came with mango-citrus dipping sauce. If you know how to fry tofu, then I bet you could make your own with the recipe linked to in this post's header.  After we downed three pitchers amongst mainly the boys in the group, we headed back to Travis' for some tomfoolery, so we went downstairs to Andrew's new apartment, which he's moving into within the next month, to check it out.  Highlights : me closing the door on Andrew when he was in his future bedroom and him struggling to get out and yelling at me even though the reason he couldn't open the door was because he was turning the handle the wrong way. We were all rather drunk, though Andrew didn't have dinner, so he was more so.  Travis and Andrew suggested that we head up to the basketball court a block up from his place and play some a dusk game of Horse. I'm not one for basketball, probably reinforced from my Jr. High School days when all my male peers played basketball, shot animals in their spare time, and rode four-wheelers; I of course, being one for videogames, guitar, and Atheism, did not fit in.   Regardless, I attempted to play even though I'm bad at basketball (I haven't practiced since I lived in Maple Leaf; I was decent back then) and the lack on sunlight made it more difficult. Near the end of our game of Horse, under the cloak of Andrew's drunken stupor and the lack of sunlight, I tied his sandals together, which he had taken off for the game, with some dental floss in my pocket. To give him some credit, the floss  was  used. After we finished the game Andrew was hunting around for his sandals, which he overlooked repeated because he didn't recognize them in the dark and tied together with a piece of floss. Once he found the sandals and saw what I'd done he flew into a drunken rage, throwing a sandal at me demanding I remove the floss. Needless to say, I did not. He exacted punishment on me by not moving his car, which was blocking mine in, when I wanted to leave. Well played sir...well played.

      The snack food industry is not sneaky or deceitful in filling a bag of potato chips with air; they do it so the chips don't get crushed. If the bag wasn't filled with air you'd have a bag of potato particles to lick off your outstretched palm. The bags are measured by weight anyways, so you're getting the same amount regardless.  Shipping packages is expensive. When you buy a large, stupid stuffed teddy bear that costs $100 for your stupid grandchild it is going to cost a lot of money to take that ungainly bag of stuffing all the way across the country. And yes, the shipping might cost more than the item if it's oversized. It's a hard concept to wrap your head around and is indicative of how backwards and kooky the world is today.   On a similar note, picture frames can often cost more, sometimes a lot more, than the actual picture they are framing. This, I cannot explain. It's a couple sticks of metal or wood, a pane of glass, and a cardboard backing. Why is the construction of this item apparently so costly? I've researched this question and found the answers: for some reason picture frames must be glazed with a viscous liquid made up of boiled-down Dodo bird, a costly item to procure for sure.

      Poland has made a surprising power play for a part in international politics by adding one of the largest numbers of troops to the Iraq war out of the willing coalition.  To keep things in perspective, let's take a look at a handful of the largest contributors to troops in Iraq.  The largest by far is the U.S. with 138,000 and Britain, our largest supporter of the war, has a measly 8,530 or matching about 6% of the troops the U.S. has in Iraq. Italy is the next largest with 7,700 and Poland surprisingly comes in third with 2,400. The Ukraine has 1,700 and the Netherlands 1,263. The last heavy hitter, making the total number of countries adding troops numbering higher than the hundreds is Japan with 1,000.   These are the highest six contributors to the Iraq war and is indicative of the international support this war truly has. The rest of the supposed coalition supporting the war in word and deed is laughable. Moltovia and Latvia (who, last I heard, was ruled with an iron fist by Dr.Doom) are tied for the lowest additions of troops with a total of 25. Thankfully Tonga is backing them up with 44 troops in Iraq.   It seems some tiny countries throughout the world are seeing the Iraq war as a perfect way to get their names into the international arena and do the Bush administration a mob-style favor by not making them look any more solitary and ridiculous than they already do. What kind of payback do you get for 44 troops though? A $1000 aid package or consulate cabin in Montana? It doesn't matter how many troops they put in as long at the coalition list has one more name for Bush to list off.

       FACT:  If all new SUVs and light trucks in the U.S. were required to get the same average MPG as new cars, we would save more oil in 10 years than would ever be produced by tapping oil supplies in ANWR.    SIDE-NOTE:  Around 10th grade in my High-School's mock-election, we had a segment where some bills were created before the event and then all our fake states made up of students would have members speak about the bills and then finally vote on them. One of these bills (which were all made up by our student elite) was to  move everyone with AIDS to ANWR . I'm serious. While that is indeed frightening that this bill was approved by the school administration to be read in front of our entire school, the most heart-chilling moment was when the entire auditorium started gleefully chanting, "ANWR! ANWR! ANWR!".   I maniacally waved my hand so I could step up to the microphone and address this disturbing, spontaneous Nazi rally, but was ignored. Finally, I was chosen to speak about an idiotic bill suggesting that judges be punished if criminals they sentence get out of jail and commit a crime again and was repeatedly chastised in front of the entire school by the man with the gavel (The Whip? Adam Bute. I have no idea.) to stop cursing.

      There is some controversy in Texas over new sexual education books, which are being reviewed and decided upon. Bush, a long-time supporter of teaching abstinence and virtually nothing else  ("I never knew what a STD was, so you can bet your bottom-dollar I stayed away from them!") . Surprise surprise, Texas is one of the top five states leading the nation in teenage pregnancies. Bush don't learn though; in the last State of the Union address he supported doubling funding for abstinence based sexual education.  Here is a fact-to-know out of some of the new textbooks being reviewed:  "A good way a teenager can prevent a sexually transmitted disease is to get plenty of rest so he or she can have a clear head about sex and choose abstinence."  Well, DUH! I always take a nap before my Friday nights, you know, so I don't make a bad choice because I'm sleep-deprived and have unprotected sex with a prostitute. Three of the books make no mention of contraceptives at all while one makes a passing reference to condoms.

      Someone from the Telecommunication Company of Iran, which is  in  Iran for heaven's sakes, visited my blog! The terrorists hate  my  freedom!  What my neighbors don't know is if  I  get bombed,  they  get bombed. Actually, they know that a bomb, if it exploded on me, would probably explode at them too, but they  don't  know that I might just get bombed yet!

       George W. Bush , squeaking by William Jefferson Clinton in the final hour. Warren Harding received a paltry one vote ( or 12.5% of the votes if I wanted to accommodate for the paltry total amount of people that participated in my survey...you asses ).   While I don't believe our President is the worst in history, he's probably in the top ten. Like I like to say, "What's it matter if you're the worst president of the United States if everyone hated another guy more?" It's already on my gravestone you suckers!  Now that that survey has ended, it's time for another!  Go vote on how I will end up dying!

      Shannon T. Bookey Jr., a 1998 graduate of Nikiski High School, is serving in the Navy aboard the USS Constellation in the Persian Gulf.  Shannon Bookey Jr. of Nikiski is in the Navy and has served three tours of duty in the Persian Gulf. During the most recent, aboard the USS Germantown, Bookey piloted Landing Craft Air Cushioned (LCAC) hovercraft into downtown Baghdad with a Marine detachment, according to his father, Shannon Bookey Sr.  It was during that tour that Shannon Jr. was wounded by enemy fire.  "But he says it wasn't enough to keep him down," his mother, Margie Bookey, said.  At present, Shannon Jr. is at Camp Pendleton in California training his replacement, as he will complete his service in June. He plans to return to the peninsula for more schooling, then pursue either a medical degree or join the Nikiski Fire Department.  "He says he's going to get a nice safe job, like an avalanche test dummy," his father joked. "We just can't wait to get him home."

       urlLink    Zebulon Nudson  The story as I heard it is Zebulon Nudson, or Zeb, who if I remember correctly was two grades ahead of me in high school, played guitar, and even showed me a thing or two once, got into a big tiff with Justin Meireis, who was in my grade and a big dumbass, and Justin and his friends all went to Zeb's house one night to kill him. There is a much richer backstory to this, but I'm telling you what I know from my friend Katie Carpenter, whom I grew up with. Anyways, Zeb knew how to use a rifle from his Army expierience and woke up when the guys pulled up or something and Zeb started shooting at them. He killed Justin and the rest of them got away. It's an ongoing thing because Zeb has been in jail for a long time for what was basically self-defense except for that Justin was turned away or running away at the time, even though these guys had fired off some shots and, I think, gotten into Zeb's house. Zeb was declared not guilty and is now suing the state of Alaska for all the losses he incurred while in jail.  Go to the  urlLink Peninsula Clarion  and search their stories for "Zebulon Nudson" and they should come up. Try results 1, 4, 7, 13, 15, 22, and 24.   On the use of guns, Meireis said, "I like guns myself, and I feel like there's too many laws on guns already. But I feel like the laws that are in there need to be enforced. With everything that's happened over the last few years with this younger generation and guns, I think they need to realize that there are consequences. Other than that, I just feel like it's not my job to say anything about anything. I just think that's for the law to take care of, and that's what the troopers are there for. That's what the courts are there for." -Justin Meireis' Dad

          Amy Dale was another person I went to school with. She was my jr. high-school crush and eventuall moved down to Seattle like I did. Moira (my gf in high-school), who also moved down to Seattle for a short period, Amy, who was going to the Art Institue, and I used to hang out every once in a while. I have NO idea why she'd be in Alaska making coffee now though.

          Airman First Class Jamie (Guenther) Cervantes U. S. Air Force   I went to school with Jaime my whole life practically! I had a huge crush on her from around first grade till, shucks, sixth? Also, apparently my childhood pal Brandon Anderson has enlisted. Jeremy Hanson did as well; he was a long-haired hippy who beat the snot out of this guy in the parking lot over a girl.

         Mary Kay Letourneau, the married, thirtyfive-year-old Seattle teacher who molested her 6th grade student and has just been released from jail. She has two children with her student, Vili Fualaau, and wants to start anew their relationship. As Mary Letourneau was released thirteen-year-old boys around the world celebrated in the streets, throwing Dragon magazines and Nintendo controllers into the air like graduation caps.   "Mary didn't take away my childhood. I gave it away by consent. I knew what I was getting into. She knew what we were getting into. I don't feel one bit in my whole entire body that she ever raped me. I don't love her because she's 30 years old and she doesn't love me because I'm 15 years old. We love each other for who we are. Do I plan to marry her? Yes, I plan to marry her. She's my world, she's my life, and they all know that I have her ring on still, and it's never going to change." -Vili Fualaau

      Tom Ridge wagged his finger at those who doubt the Bush administration truthfulness with their terror warnings after the latest increase in color (to mauve, I believe, the most dangerous of all colors) was due to information from three years old to almost a month. Tom Ridge was representing straight up saying that the Homeland Security department was all about showing the terrorists what's up and not about politics after the day before he announced the terror alert increase and made a point of adding that this late-breaking info was due to the great work President Bush is doing.

      My teeth are still aching. My dentist repaired the falling-apart filling he originally put in, but I'm still getting some pain here. I've had more trouble with this dentist than any other, so I dumped him. He was too concerned with having a hip office with cool art and music than good dentistry. Would you allow a doctor to perform surgery if the operating room had Radiohead playing in the background and a painting of a vagina on the wall? No sir. I think we can all agree on this.

          I saw the Pants-on-fire-mobile! It was taking a turn on 3rd and Pike. It didn't actually shoot fire out of the Bush effigys' pants like I heard, but it had red lights and fake fire. It was a welcome sight nonetheless. It DID spray blood out of the rotating head with devil horns though.

      I invite anyone to email me their reasons for believing Clinton was a bad president.   ik@mka.com  I've heard the emotional reasoning as to why people didn't like him or thought he was a bad person, but I've yet to hear any credible argument as to how he was a bad president, so if you've got some I'd be glad to hear it.

      Apparently the people voting in my survey don't know their history. Bill Clinton is leading Nixon AND Warren Harding, not to mention our current President, who if you compare soley by record with Clinton, falls flat on his smirking face.   But Clinton got a BJ, so I can really understand why people hate him. I mean, who cares that our country was insanely prosperous under his administration? What matters is his personal life. I mean, once someone enter politics every single thing they do in their personal life is critical and relevant to the job and to the public. Bush was arrested for a DUI and sure, he could have easily killed some kids, but what is important is that Bush punishes criminals for small crimes with long prison sentences and execution, since that has been proven to not deter crime at all...Geez. I make a lousy Republican. The lack logic just jumps right out at me.  Fume fume fume, blah blah blah.
