      Well, after meeting Becky, I must say, I'm very impressed. She sort of strikes me as a nitemare hippie girl to quote the song, but she quite lovely really, it'll be interesting to see where this one goes as I really would like to have a relationship with her. The nitemare hippie girl is an imperative choice in ones list of lovers, fortunately, she's a clean hippie, and seems to really tolerate my insanity well. I'll go for a hike with her weekend after next, that'll rule.

      Well, at about two last night, I managed to get stuck in the bloody ass by a fucking wind scorpion and christ allmighty, that hurt like a motherfucker. My left leg is still dead.  In other news though, Chimmy and I are talking about partying in the Netherlands, it seems like a damn cool idea, get to a country that isn't likely to kill me, pretty peaceful, very openminded. Europe's Canada. Man, Europe is pretty nice.  As for seeing Becky, that was just bizarre, even more bizarre was that I thought she was pretty before I recognized her. Thought about grabbing her number in spite of the other women.  Of course, then I get stung by a scorpion. Life is fucked up sometimes. A big novel if you will. Symbols.  Next weekend I'm doing shrooms I guess. That's cool.  Man, my relationships get weirder and weirder and weirder as time goes on.

      So I head out thinking I'm going to meet Tamar and her friends, instead I meet Nikki at the Frontier, by mistake no less, and I wind up after talking for an hour, making her laugh (That's all the ladies want me for anymore, making them laugh) I finally get the courage to go ask Becky for her number, I walk up, am surrounded by the group, and we exchange information.  She's got a lot of Brittany's features, but taller, fuller breasts. Looks good.  Now, this is absolutely bizarre, I always liked Becky despite her being a year younger, and when my plans didn't work I met up with her. Curiouser and curiouser. I'm certainly pursuing this, there isn't a ring on my finger.  As for Elyce, this marks the gazillionth time she's bailed on me. I'm beginning to see how she works in relationships, I'm not sure this one will hold on much longer.

      As it stands right now, we have little to no real literature, poor art, a complete lack of philosophical thought, and the values of the common man are slowly slipping away to the temptations of avarice and cowardice.  As far as art and literature stand, I have yet to see anything really creative and talented come out of anywhere apart from the few choice Generation X writers such as Welsh and Palahnuik. Apart from that, literature is somewhat dead, I don't look for new releases from anyone anymore although I'm thinking that Turtledove might be the modern day science-fiction genius that we're looking for. Music is so terrible, that apart from a few very choice artists, I have to say that the RIAA doesn't deserve to even have that shit stolen from them. Of course, I think that the RIAA is a fine example of a loss of values. Modern Art is so depressing and cliche, and if you really want to jump into the realm of Film, all I have to say is, "The Matrix."  Tying into the theme of a lack of philosophy, let's examine the wonderful thoughts inside the Matrix: "We might be ruled by machines inside of a dream world." Yeah, I had that brilliant thought when I was learning how to not shit my pants. People sucked that down like complete suckers though, impressive, especially considering that Cyberpunk is pretty lousy in its own right.  Back to the point, no one is really thinking anymore, expanding horizons or anything like that, and I'm damn sure that we have not had every philosophical thought that there is to have. This makes me want to do acid.  As for values, those are drying up faster than a swallow puddle in the hot arizona sun. We're willing to compromise integrity for personal gain, we lack the courage to do the right thing, the courage to accept failure and the wisdom to simply laugh when we do. Nothing is as dramatic as we'd hope, largely thanks to tabloids and action movies. Most of our lives are as benign and mundane as they come.  As for the future, and what comes from this, I think that we're going to be seeing a big change in the next few years, as in my life time, we shall see a rise and fall, either another great awakening or another dark ages, regardless of which one it is, it is meant to happen and will only serve to restore what we have lost inside of ourselves.  It takes a much more courageous man to not have a finger on the trigger than the frightened coward that always stands behind it.

      And on one extra note, knowing that I have few, if any readers and at least no comments is one of the best feelings in the world. I'm writing this for myself, not for an audience. Far too often I find myself in a situation where I'm caving to the reader, the reader is not breaking to my whim. It's a great feeling to just write. The typos are great, I don't have to correct anything, this blog is a damn good idea. I think I'll keep it private and avoid giving the link out.

      Well, after a bizarre evening of driving around the entire city, literally the entire city, from the mesa to both indian reservations to the foothills, and much listening to Pink Floyd, and getting blown off in someway by all the people I seek social interaction with, I'd opted to take an incredibly long bike ride tomorrow.  Bike riding is a lot of fun. You should try it.  It's a strange task we set before ourselves with other people as they're often times the most unreliable of things. If anything, tonight teaches me to not put much faith in them.  I've read a lot more of the Wikipedia again, man, that is really informative, I wish that AT would get a section, it would be nice for some recognition, sadly, I don't know much of the history of the site prior to my first visits during April and May of my freshman year of high school (I'm now in entering my senior year, man, this has been a trip. 2002-2004, I've been around for almost half of the site's life now) so I cannot write a lot of it. I think I just need a bit more time before I start to get some recognition in the industry, such things are gradual, and worthless unless earned.  The argument on doing Acid and LSD is becoming more and more intriguing. It looks like the urban myths around the drug change a lot of things about it, such as flashbacks. I bring the right set to it, but I haven't done any drugs previously and that could prove dangerous, I should talk to some people how have done it.  The Guns of the South has proven to be a very interesting novel, incredibly well researched, and most intriguing with the mystery set up. I'm going to keep reading. And listening to Pink Floyd. Man, this shit is awesome.  I tried dry shaving for the first time tonight because I was too lazy to do the real thing. Didn't hurt, I don't know what the fuck people are complaining about, didn't give a close shave either, but I wasn't looking for that.  Wow, I went all over the place, not a whole lot happened to day, and I am commited to at least one post a day, everyday.

      Okay, so in an attempt to get my head(s) thinking clearly, I'm going to go over my relationships with all of the women in my life. I don't really think anyone reads this, I'm damn sure none of the girls do, so I'm probably in the clear.    Elyce:  What can I say? The Asian Persuasian and the most reliable girl of the group. Our relationship starts with me holding her hair back while she's throwing up, and everyone things we had sex that night. Of course, all that happened was a few lovely drunken kisses (I don't drink) although things really got hot and heavy the next time we saw each other. Since then the fires have cooled although I might have a date with her sometime this weekend.   Brittany:  A good friend, and someone that I've known for a really long time, the relationship has always been there, at least with me being there for her, which has been convenient for her. We've talked about it, and in the end, we both go where the wild goose goes, that is to say that we're not reliable enough for each other, or rather, we're going to endlessly lead each other on despite the fact that there's some certain love in our interaction.   Jessica:  I don't know that this one really counts, I know nothing will happen, but I am getting her a Rabbit Vibrator when I turn 18 to be a nice guy, and maybe she'll at least let me make a how-to video with her using it.   Kristen:  She's growing as a person, and I'm certainly helping her along, but she's not quite ready to be interacting with anyone in the way that she wants to be and the way that I like to be. She just needs to grow more on a personal level and find out who she is and what she really wants, as well as how to safely get it without opening herself to lots of pain. The Id in a beautiful woman's body.   Lindsey:  Wonderful fun, and she does owe me sex still from our bet, but I doubt that I'll ever get to collect thanks to the simple fact that our relationship has always been very, well, lucid. Nothing is ever concrete or simple, and further more, nothing ever happens either. Lots of talk, but little or no actual substance. She's grown to a level that we might be able to interact in a very interesting fashion if we ever do decide to act on it.   There's probably a dozen girls I forgot that have just drifted away for the past two weeks or so, and school will certainly bring about some changes in who I'm interacting with, let's just hope that things go smoothly, as I doubt that I'll want to hang out with much of anyone from school. It's a bizarre frustration when you realize that out of forty people not one of them share the same passions that you do.

      Damn, I had one killer day. I went for a bike ride as I discussed not half a page below, and I managed to pick up two books, both sci-fi, both talked about in my Latin class, and on top of that, I grabbed Pink Floyd's the Wall. Then I took a nap.  Brittany and I talked about doing Acid, then people kept talking about horrible flashbacks although it seems that that is not the norm, and that if you only do it a few times and you avoid ever reaching back into that spot of your memory again you'll do find. An open, accepting mind is key. I wonder if I'm prepared for it...  Regardless, I've been sleeping a lot, reading a lot, and writing a lot, I wonder if I'm prepared for senior year, hopefully the sleep schedule will balance out, I'm gonna start waking up at 5:30 again soon, maybe go for a bike ride early in the morning down to the frontier mart or something. It's a great feeling to just ride...

      Well, after a brief bout with some horribly nasty acid reflux or heartburn or whatever euphemism you want to call being BURNED FROM THE INSIDE, I woke up, and proceeded to write news posts over on the main site for everything. Thus far I've written seven this morning alone. Now I know that Uros has me beat in terms of workload put into the site, but damn, seven is a lot before 7:30 AM, if my school got this kind of work out of me I'd be on honor roll.  Suffice my health problems, I'm feeling pretty good, I might even decide to go for a bike ride out to the bookstore and best buy in a few in order to get some exercise in the cool morning air... That would rule! I'm totally going.

       I think that breasts are a bizarre topic. A very bizarre one. Here's what I look for in breasts in no particular order, like if I had to be the judge of the breast contest, here's what I would judge on:   Size. Duh. Well, I'm more of an A kind of guy. See, the advantage to smaller breasts is that they don't sag. Saggy tits are disgusting. See, an A rarely if ever sags, and they're never in the way of anything. Anything larger than a B or C in my experience is prone to sagging like a motherfucker. And the chick is probably a cunt that thinks of herself as higher thanks to her tits anyways.  Coloration. Contrast is key here. You see, a nice vanilla with red rose nipples certainly makes my balls boil. White with very red equals very sexy. Of course, for all of you that aren't white, those are attractive too provided they've got the fancy chocolate mousse color that reminds us of that wonderful desert.  Texture. Scars, strech marks and hair? Disgusting. Breasts are meant to be kept as works of art, like fine marble flooring. Or statues. Breasts must be in pristine shape.   This is just my opinion, and I'm pretty sure nobody else reads this as I don't hand out the link to anyone, but breasts man, those are wonderful if they are in fact wonderful. I always like a good pair.

      Well, there's one week left, the beautiful part is that everyone else I know is already in school so I have literally no one to hang out with apart from my sisters. Most of Albuquerque is back to ghost town status as far as kids out of school. Bosque seems to be the only one starting late, largely because of a lack of inservice days and only having a one week spring break (Winterim counts as school).  Senior year, for me, is not that exciting because, at this point in my life, gaming is a lot more interesting and seeing as I do so much of it, it's not just some childhood fantasy, it is a real thing to me. With the Fall Pick-up and E3, I'm much more excited about those than Graduation, and I care more about what comes out next fall than I do what college I go to.  However, thanks to senior thesis, I will probably be able to write my paper on gaming, which is good because I probably can't use books at Zimmerman anymore.

      I would like to state that first and foremost, my name is Jackson. I get called Smapdey, Smap, Smappey, Smappers, and many, many, many other variations of the name. That's fine with some people, but for the record, I do in fact have a name that my parents gave me, and that name is Jackson.  One week left until high school starts again, yay. Senior year, I can only imagine the fun.
