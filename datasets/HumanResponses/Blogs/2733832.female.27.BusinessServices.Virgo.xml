      Uh…yeah.  Right.  Life is just so daily.  I need a little less excitement and a little more down time.  I really don’t enjoy having something to do EVERY weekend.  It gets a little tedious.  When do I get to cuddle up with my honey, in front of the fire, and do NOTHING?  Ok, sorry about the caps, but I just need to emphasize.  I do like the seclusion of a snowy cabin in the Sierra’s and a visit up the coast on a foggy day.  Melancholy or gloom, maybe isolation, I like that better than a party.  Super Bowl Sunday.  A day of American lore: when heroes are made into legends.  Oh, give me a break, football is just football.  It’s a game.  In the big scheme of things does it even really matter?  I cannot get my head around how much money is wasted on this one day in the life.  So narcissistic men can get up on the podium and refer to themselves in the third person?  To inspire kids into believing if they work hard they too can become self-absorbed, wealthy individuals who are above the law.  All right, all right, I’m getting off the soapbox; although, isn’t that the point of having a blog?

      Texture the ceiling  “I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.”  And that's about that.  At least I posted something.

      One for Connie  I googled my ex-boyfriend and found his website yesterday.  I’m torn as to contact him or let sleeping dogs lie.  Looks like he may be engaged, which I am truly happy about.  I am glad he found someone that he believes he can spend the rest of his life with.  I haven’t spoken to him in years, and the last time he tried to contact me was THE DAY before my wedding!  What drama.  Not that I called him back, but it was so typical him to call me the day before my wedding.  I just want a little closure I think.  It was really good, but REALLY bad too.  And since we never did say goodbye, a little part of me wants to do that.  And a little part of me wants to rub in the fact that I’m married and very happy.  Why do I even want to make contact????  Why am I still thinking about it?  Why am asking so many questions, when you don't have the answers?  So, do I have a final final or let it go?  At least I know I can if I want to, not that that makes it easier.

      Recon Mission  Ok, this whole blog thing is interesting.  I haven’t found my grove yet.  I think it’s because I don’t get the point, but whatever.  So, went to a 1 year old birthday party this weekend, which I believe is just an excuse for the adults to get together and drink.  Does the kid really have a clue?  No.  She didn’t want to eat the cake, she didn’t want to open gifts, but we did enjoy the keg.  Had friends over last night for dinner and business.  Had way too much wine, which isn’t fun to deal with on a Monday morning.  I’m a horrible wife.  I haven’t cleaned the bathrooms in weeks, only like 3, but still.  I haven’t mopped, which is driving me batty, but I don’t like to.  I have all kinds of laundry, and yes I am hoping it grows legs and gets itself done.  Why do women obsess about these things?  Why is my self worth determined by my ability to get these chores done once a week?

      Get Down On It  The weekend is off to a great start.  My carpool mate bought me my "Venti, NF, 2 pump, Mocha" for the commute into work this AM, and, of course, I spilt it all over myself about 2 blocks from my house.  Please tell me this is NOT how my weekend is going to be.  My hubby had to work late last night, so I have spent about 7 minuts with him in the last 30 hours.  Ah, the makings of an everlasting love.  So much I could say, but won't.  I'm hoping that my weekend will be as perfect as last.  We actually had NO company stop in.  Imagine, getting to hang out in your sweats all day, watch football, and not have to answer the door OR the telephone.  How much closer to heaven can you get?

      Shibboleth \SHIH-buh-luth\ noun 1 a : a catchword or slogan used by members of a group but regarded by others as empty of real meaning b : a commonly held belief  2 : a behavior or use of language that identifies a person as belonging to a group  So many shibboleth's to share, so little time.  I guess I could be doing some work, but what is the point of that right now?  I'm a little unfocused, unstable, undecisive, or is that indecisive?  I'm lacking a focus.  At least I now have a creative outlet with my Blog Spot.

      Take it down a notch  I haven’t blogged in awhile, but that’s because I have nothing profound to say.  I still have an urge to run outside and just yell at the top of my lungs.  Just scream for the sake of screaming.  Don’t you ever feel that way?  I’ve just discovered Michael Buble.  WONDERFUL, that’s really all I can say.  His CD is great!  He’s going to be in the bay area soon, but his concert is sold out.  I guess I’m not as hip and with it as I thought.  I’m trying to plan my vacation to London/Scotland/Germany, but my hubby is dragging his feet.  One second yes, one second no.  I just want to be there already.  I wish I could stay for months, but it’s not to be.  I think I should go to business school in London, then I could move there for a few years, but it would entail actually going to school.  Well, you know the lotto is up to 35 million.  I would be absolutely fabulous with 15 million.  Even if I had to split it, I could handle 7.  At least then I could stay in Europe a wee bit longer.  Ok, really I haven’t done a thing at work today.  It’s been e-mail and blogging.  A little listening to the radio and idle chit chat.  I guess I better do something since I’m taking a longer lunch and leaving a bit early.  But then again, what are Friday’s for?

      You're killin' me smalls  V-day.  It will be nice, but it really is just a commercialized event.  At least this year it coincides with President's Day, so there will be some really good sales going on.  I am a lost soul.  I haven't found what is going to make me happy.  I know I can go looking for something to MAKE me happy, but in the end, isn't it me?  Aren't I the only one who can truly make myself happy?  I have an idea but it is so hard to articulate and "seal a paln of action."  Wishes, hopes, and dreams.  Do any of them really come true?

      Couple hours on the couch  Pay bills, pay bills, pay bills, that’s what I did this week.  Oh, well.  When does life get easier?  I guess I can make it easier by living simpler, but where is the fun in that.  I want to go to Europe, come home, get preggers, and the rest will be history.  Only I still want more than I can have, or at least I believe that’s what I want.  Maybe children really do change your life that much.  Maybe I need to have a child to actually become a grown-up.  But who wants to be a grown-up?  I guess the real problem is me.  My outlook needs to change before life becomes what I want.  If I put all my energy into what I want and visualize, will it REALLY come to be?  Do I have to write it down and have clearly defined goals in order for my picture perfect life to materialize?  What if I just have a concept of what I want to be when I grow-up?  Does anyone really have the answers?  Why do we ask so many questions?  I know it can’t be just me.  Maybe if we had the answers, life wouldn’t be so beautiful, or special, or filled with wonder everyday; I would probably take it for granted if I knew what it was all about, wouldn’t you?  I wouldn’t enjoy the beautiful colors in the sunset.  I wouldn’t take the time to look at the stars when I get out of the car at night.  Would I look at the full moon with awe every month if I had the answers?  This is a long way from my bills.     Life isn't fair. It's just fairer than death, that's all.

       Love ya, mean it, double guns   How about them Pats?  I was rooting for Carolina, only for monetary reasons, but did want New England to win.  Another drunken weekend.  How much alcohol can one person consume in 48 hours before it becomes an issue?  I think I might hop up onto the wagon for a bit…oh but wait.  Valentine’s is next weekend and we’re going wine tasting.  A two-week detox period should be good.   I love the sound of rain hitting my bedroom window; however, I do not love getting out of bed and having to work when the rain is hitting against my bedroom window.  I think that it should be a holiday if it rains, and someone needs to enact a law that the Monday after the Super Bowl is a holiday.  Will someone please work on that?  I was just thinking to myself, “self…” how great is an electronic diary?  This whole blog thing is great because if you do it anonymously, you don’t have to worry about someone finding it.  I don’t even thing peeps know this site exists, unless I tell them.  And the best part is, I have always been more comfortable telling strangers things I can’t tell my mother.

      I don’t even know.  Ok, I am still lacking any sort of motivation.  I don’t want to be here, I want to have Spring Break.  Why don’t companies shut down for a couple weeks here and there?  Why not have summer vacations?  Really?  The American workforce would probably so much more enthusiastic and love work a bit more, if we knew we would get a break every now and again.  2 weeks is for the birds (not a clue what that means).  I spend 2 weeks on doctor appointments and other random appointments in no time.  We, as a society, do need more time off.  Am I sensing a theme with my blogs?  Just had my first Soy Mocha.  Now that’s different.  I need to drink the soy a little bit more so I become used to it.  I think I should not be drinking cow milk.  If you analyze, the whole point of cow’s milk is to make calves fat.  Why do humans drink it?  Don’t you think it’s a little odd?  I can see making things with it.  Use it sparingly and such, but to drink the cow’s milk…I don’t think so.  Now don’t tell anyone about this blasphemous idea, it could very well be ground for a divorce.  But come on people think about it!!!!  I’m going to try it out and see how far I can take it.  I’m sitting here trying to think of all the things I use milk for, and really can’t.  One does not have to eat cereal for breakfast.  Oatmeal is absolutely fab with water.  You don’t have to have a glass with dinner, red wine will do.  Maybe the wee little ones need the milk, but just for a bit, maybe.  I think that’s what formula is for, right?  They get all the nutrients and such from that, along with the breast milk.  AH-HA!!!  You don’t see female breast milk on the store shelves.  You aren’t going around buying breast milk, are you?  Breast milk is used for the kiddies to grow up nice and strong.  And then they stop drinking it.  And this is why I shouldn’t drink milk.  I think that I am the only this makes sense to.

          Why can’t I just run away?  Sometimes, ok almost all the time, I feel the “responsibility” to be a productive member of society is literally just too overwhelming.  And really, I don’t feel like I am a productive member of society.  And while I’m at it…is everyone dead set on annoying the shite out of me today?  I feel sorry for them, as they have no concept on how annoying they actually are.  Do you all really think I care?  Did I give you the impression that I care?  I don’t think so.  I just ask questions because I might be little nosey.  This can’t be all there is…when do I get to the point when something exciting happens?  I know it has to be out there waiting for me.  Really, how do I find it?  How do I find what it is that I love; so I can do what I love and let the cash follow.  It happens, I know it does.  I see it in magazines, in books, on those trashy tabloid TV shows, although I have stopped watching those.  When does it happen to me?  It’s beginning to build like one of those cartoon snowballs that run out of control and squash a whole town.  I do have a deep appreciation for life; I just can’t believe that this is all.  How do I figure it out?  How can the things that make be bonkers and want to dig a hole and hide, make others happy?  Do you feel the need for something, anything, astonishing, captivating, enchanting fascinating?  Do you know, really, truly, deep down, KNOW, that there is more?  That yes, one second everything will be gray, and suddenly there will be light and it will be so clear, that you’ll wonder what you were thinking all along.

       Is everyone here to piss me off?   I am in such a BAD mood.  We have been planning this damn weekend, based on someone else’s idea, and now “someone else” is begging out.  HELLO, I really didn’t want to do this, but I was being a good friend and said yes, sounds like fun…and where does nice get me?  Stuck doing something I don’t want to do.  Oh, eventually I’ll have fun this weekend, but I just wanted to be annoyed for a little while.  PLUS, the people at work are buggin me to no end.  Oh, happy 3-day weekend.

      Oh, I don’t even know…  I actually began typing yesterday, but work got in the way…isn’t that always the case?  So, another weekend I’m never going to get back.  This makes 2 in a row that I don’t remember actually going to bed, I just wake-up there.  First, last weekend, a wedding OUT OF CONTROL.  I still cannot believe how absolutely rude I was, but only once, and at least I realize it.  Just another thing I said that I wish I could take back, it seems to happen a lot.  It was quite interesting.  I’ve only had a breakdown once, OK maybe twice, while drinking.  And it is so interesting when a person who you think has it all together has a breakdown.  It’s also v. interesting that while intoxicated, you believe that whomever you are talking to, at that moment is your “best friend” and you can tell them anything.  Lucky for her I’m not a gossipmonger, but HELLO, I don’t WANT to know.  But who am I to judge?  I’m the one who has to call everyone at ALL hours of the night when inebriated and share whatever is happening to me, or ask, “Why aren’t you over here drinkin’ with me?”    So, I’ve actually been married 3 years.  That’s practically a long-term marriage in California; I’m an old timer, a virtual pro!  I guess it’s time to start thinking about those pesky brats, HA!  That’s probably why I haven’t been “blessed” yet; I keep calling ‘em brats.  I know I want children, but I believe it is my fear of the unknown that is holding me back.  That, and everyone keeps asking me questions that 1) really do not pertain to them and 2) are NONE OF THEIR DAMN BUSINESS.  Really, mind your fuckin’ own g.d. business.

      "And as for you my galvanized friend...you want a heart? Well, you don't know how lucky you are not to have one!" --The Wizard, The Wizard of Oz  Is it so bad to agree with that?  I’m back from vacation, as if you missed me, and I can’t believe it only took 5 minutes in the car before I was screaming cuss words at all the drivers.  Isn’t it a little scary how we slip right back into the pace of things after a nice relaxing vacation?  You may try to stay in that frame of mind, but I think the world is stacked against it.  You turn the TV on and see the horrible news, you watch TV, the same, read the newspaper and it’s just more.  How can you separate yourself from that and try to remain somewhat at peace.  How can you consciously try to forget the horrors in this world so that you can live your life without guilt, shame, fear, disgust, or regret?    How do I make a difference?  I wish this were something that I could explain to folks so that they would understand.  There are those who just would not get it: the need for something that will actually count.  It’s not enough to be talking and thinking about this all the time, I need more.  Will that need change with children?  Will it be enough to have and raise a child?  Will that make me feel that I have made a valuable contribution to society, to this planet?  If I didn’t have a heart, would it matter less?

       Wait a minute. Strike that. Reverse it.   Oh, ain't life grand?  I'm still ill and just want to sleep.  The weather has been so gloomy, I guess no one let Mother Nature know it's June, and all I want to do is curl up in bed with a book; although, that would require me buying a new book.  Why do moms pull such guilt trips?  I mean really mother, I am an adult.  I can, and do, make decisions on a daily basis that end up helping people and solving problems.  Do you really thing a decision I make now, without your buy in or approval; is just the worst thing in the world?  Do you really think Im going straight to hell?  Even the actual person it affected appreciated the decision I made.  UGH...and why do I care, oh yeah, she's my mum.  It's just so damn irritating.  I'm going to do it, whether she likes it or not, whether I feel guilty or not, I just wish the guilt wouldn't eat away at me.  Ah, the joys of being a recovering catholic.  So, patriotic day is this weekend.  All the crazy overzealous patriots really scare me.  I'm not quite sure where they're coming from, meaning I don't understand their point of view at all.  It's really scary that there are folks who just follow blindly.

       Experience is a hard teacher because she gives the test first, the lesson afterwards. ---Vernon Law   Oh, so true.  I feel like a 19-year-old sorority girl.  I went out last weekend with a girlfriend and we had a “wild & crazy” time, with a few humiliating and extremely embarrassing occurrences.  I guess I just can’t hold my alcohol like I used to.  I can’t even begin to explain what happened due to the enormous amount of guilt, shame, humiliation, etc. I feel.  Nope, can’t do it.  Still dwelling…ok I have to stop thinking about it.  I’ve always liked repression.  Of course, don’t they say confession is good for the soul?  I don’t think it’s going to work in this case, I feel nauseous just typing about it.  I’ve started The Rule of Four by those 2 best friends about an ancient document I can’t pronounce.  It’s pretty good so far.  I really liked The DaVinci Code and the whole secret societies, codes, and puzzles.  They are saying this is even better…we’ll see.  After I finish, I’ll probably start looking up the Hypnerotomachia.

       Who took the jam outta your doughnut?   Yup, I’m pretty sure that’s what everyone is thinking.  I really can’t handle this “trying to be more positive” routine; it’s just not me.  I really, truly can’t handle it anymore…I’m serious this time; I‘m not dealing with it.  I’m just sick of everyone, well almost everyone.  I want to sit on my couch, watch the basketball game, watch Howard Stern, and go to sleep.  I need a more comfortable couch and a new book.  We have not had a meal at home since Wednesday, maybe Tuesday.  Why, WHY, do WE have to go everywhere and visit everyone?  Do you think our presence will be that missed, nope, I don’t.  This sounds horrible, but I’m really looking forward to my husband going out of town this weekend.  Everyone knows he’s going to be gone, so they shouldn’t call or stop by, and our presence won’t be requested anywhere.  AHHHH, I get giddy just typing about it.  And speaking of my hubs, he’s 75% of the cause.  All these “events” are because of him…his family, his friends, his co-workers, him, him, him.  Um, that felt a bit better.  Festering…still festering…and still.  I think this is what women do best.  I can't be alone on this one.  After an hour-long conversation, one little thing sticks in our brain that gets stuck like a splinter, and just festers.  And you think about it for HOURS afterwards.  About what you said, what he said, what you should’ve said, what you’re going to say, what he’s going to say, on and on it goes.  I get so worked up about a conversation that hasn’t taken place yet all because of festering.  And then when you say exactly what you want to say, and you are all set with how you’re going to respond to his response, he goes and says something different.  Men.

       Shibboleth   Instead of calling a “friend” to tell them “no, I can’t (really don’t want to) go out with you,” I’ve completely avoided the whole situation.  This person is really not MY friend, but the wife of my husband’s b-man…and a complete whacko.  This goes back to my whole “people + alcohol = instant best friend” theory.  I don’t believe that folks are my best friends just because I’ve had a few drinks, but others seem to think this to be true.  Note to self: the world IS NOT made up of your friends.  Whenever she sees me, she just clings on and starts talking about things that are (1) none of my business and (2) not to be shared with my husband.  HELLO!!!  While I don’t tell my husband EVERYTHING, I am not, and probably couldn’t, keep from him anything having to do with his boss’s marital relationship.  I mean, it’s just too juicy.  For fear of them finding this blog one day, I will not go into detail but the hot topics are: divorce, plastic surgery, me calling her a bitch…to her face (which NEVER happened), and my husband and I having marital problems.  Oh, so my whole point to this is that we’ve been invited to their son’s graduation party, but not really as guests, but to help BBQ the chicken.  Don’t send me an invitation if you just want a gift and my hubs to BBQ the fucking chicken.  Just ask him as a favor so that I don’t have to make an appearance and “be on” for all the fake folks.  So I can do something really productive with my day, like shop, or hang with friends, or, heaven help me, go see a damn movie.  OK, I think I’m done.  Now for my new mantra, which I have been looking at for some time now, but can’t seem to follow…  The way to happiness – keep your heart free from hate, your mind from worry, live simply, expect little, give much.  Isn’t it always easier said then done?

       Alright, enough already   So, I'm going to attempt to be a bit more positive.  I've noticed lately that I complain about a lot of things.  A thought just popped into my head, isn't that what people want to hear?  When they ask you how you are, do they want to hear you are doing really well?  That your marriage is great, you have a very busy social life, you're financially secure, etc. etc. etc.?  No, they don't.  And I've decided that this is so based on the fact that after I tell someone how I am, they complain about something.  They don't go into detail about the good stuff, just the negative.    Ok, that being more positive thing seems to have slipped right out the window, let me go and pick it up.  I have finalized my plans to attend my girlfriend's bachelorette party in Vegas baby, Vegas.  I CAN NOT, no matter how hard I try, say Vegas, without saying baby.  Thank you Jon Favreau.  And I am really excited about going because I will be there with a bunch of partying fools!!!  My favorite bunch of people.  I am rooming with a bit of the straight and narrow, but with all the bad influences, I think we may be able to turn her around.  I am also really excited about the Vegas trip because my hubby and I are starting to "for reals" focus on having a baby.  This entails all that charting and documenting crap and a lot of hard work on my end.  But in the end, I'll have a baby to show for it...which will prevent me from attending bachlorette parties in Vegas baby...for awhile.

       Someone said they are "mudding" this weekend, and I asked what they were talking about. They explained they are texturing the walls in one of their bedrooms, which lead me to think of 'texturing the ceilings." Don't ask.        So, I have a fun filled weekend planed. Tonight, an obligatory husband function. Meaning, I do something he likes 'cause we're doing something I like tomorrow night. Then, oh I can hardly contain my excitement, it's his companies family picnic on Saturday. WHAT JOY!!!!  But, then we do go somewhere fun Saturday, phew.      What in the hell IS IT all about?

       I have an incredible urge to job surf.&nbsp; I really like my job, and LOVE the pay, but I feel that my life is out of control working here.&nbsp; I completely feel that I have a hold on my job, but the one on my life is slipping.&nbsp; I'm not home so late, but it's usually around 6.&nbsp; My husband, and I do as well, likes to eat dinner early, so more or less right away.&nbsp; So, once I'm home, I'm not actually relaxing until after we eat and do the dishes, which puts it around 7, but realistically 7:30.&nbsp; I'm just rushing, rushing, rushing.&nbsp; And once all that is done, I don't necessarily have the time to "relax."&nbsp; I either have to do something, you know all those household chores, or go somewhere.&nbsp; It's really frustrating.&nbsp; So, I don't even begin to wind down until 8:30 or 9, and we usually go to bed on school nights around 9:30, 10 if it's not a "sex night" (we don't really have scheduled sex nights, but&nbsp;we "just know" which nights we will)&nbsp;but even then we may be up for a "couple hours on the couch."&nbsp; My point being that I don't truly unwind in time to go to sleep.&nbsp; I think, hope, and pray, that if I did work closer to home, I would have a bit more time in the AM, and some additional time in the evening.&nbsp; If I didn't work at all, the hours in a day would be just fine.&nbsp; Do you realize it's August.&nbsp; Hmhm, yup, August.&nbsp; As in this year is over and I better start Christmas shopping, or at least thinking up the list.&nbsp;Now that I have absolutely freaked myself out, I think I'll go and surf the web.

       Ah, doesn’t that conjure up memories of summertime.&nbsp;Last night we went to bed early, as we always do on Sunday nights, and I was awakened to the sound of squealing tires on pavement rounding our corner.&nbsp; Not once, not twice, but THREE FUCKING times.&nbsp; You know, I’m relatively young, but I very often find myself saying, “Kids these days”.&nbsp; It makes me want to throw nails out into the street, or any other crazy barrier that may hurt them.&nbsp; I’m not really a violent person, but they really pissed me off.&nbsp; Especially since I couldn’t go back to sleep and had to go watch TV for an hour before crawling into bed at 2:30.&nbsp; But even then I couldn’t sleep, nothing but tossing and turning.&nbsp; So, the only sane thing to do, other than calling in sick, was to oversleep by 45 minutes.&nbsp; Whatever, I was still dressed in time for the carpool.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So, I just got off the phone with my sister.&nbsp; I had shot her an e-mail explaining how our brother’s girlfriend drove down to the docks with me to drop my ‘rents off at their cruise ship.&nbsp; The very surreal moment was when the girlfriend started crying saying good-bye to MY parents.&nbsp; They are only going to be gone for 10 days.&nbsp; 10, one-zero, 10.&nbsp; Not 2 weeks, not 2 months, not 10 months…10 days.&nbsp; And she started crying.&nbsp; I’m their daughter, and I sure as hell wasn’t teary eyed.&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; And then my mom started getting misty eyed.&nbsp; I guess she’s the daughter my mom always wanted.&nbsp; Give me a break.&nbsp; And I can expound on this all day if given the opportunity, but as I am at work, I have to stop.&nbsp; Now.

      Now that is a phrase I love…although the incantation doesn’t come across via a blog.If all goes well, I’ll be preggers in the next couple weeks.&nbsp; If not, I think it may be time to see an M.D.&nbsp; It’s kind of exciting actually doing it this way.&nbsp; I feel like it is well planned and won’t be a total and complete shock if it happens.&nbsp; Not that it would be now, but just KNOWING that you are doing all the “right” things and the possibilities if it actually working make me feel all gooey inside.&nbsp; I told my husband I didn’t want to work if I get pregnant, and he was all for it.&nbsp; I think (it’s so nice to daydream now, because once that kid comes along…ALL THIS is going to change) I’ll get a job closer to home if necessary, but won’t work until “they’re” age 5ish.&nbsp; It could work.&nbsp; I think.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; After all this is CA and you all know the cost of living out here.&nbsp; I just have to stop buying things, like shoes and mochas.&nbsp; Ah, the little things in life.

       I don't think this really qualifies as a shibboleth; however, it is a good inside joke between my hubs and I.&nbsp; I did get to meet my cousin's baby this weekend.&nbsp; Ah, what an adorable baby.&nbsp; He really is cute; I'm not just saying that.&nbsp; He has the longest fingers ever, and didn't make a peep while visiting.&nbsp; I got the low-down on the birth process, though not nearly enough information, and the run-down on the breast-feeding process.&nbsp; Oh boy.     &nbsp;   We've been staying at my in-laws this week because my mother-in-law went to visit my brother-in-law and we had to stay with my father-in-law.&nbsp; Ah, the in-law's.&nbsp; My F-I-L had a stroke about 13 years ago and is partially paralyzed.&nbsp; He can communicate, but has a very limited vocabulary and forgets specifics, so sometimes it's a guessing game.&nbsp; It hasn't been that bad; however, I'm not the one "physically" taking care of him.&nbsp; I just do the cooking and cleaning and my husband handles everything else.&nbsp; There's a "lady" that comes out to stay with him and do the "physical" stuff during the day, but we need to be there at night.&nbsp; If I step back and analyze all that needs to be done, I begin to realize the life my M-I-L lives.&nbsp; And even though she is a M-I-L, who can, and sometimes (OK, often) does, all those M-I-L things, I realize that she deserves more of my respect, or maybe more appreciation.&nbsp; It's difficult as she is cut from a different cloth than my family.&nbsp; I can't explain it, it's a bit of a&nbsp;cross between...oh, I just can't explain it.&nbsp; It's different than my matriarchal family.&nbsp; My i-l's are matriarchal, but it's just...different.&nbsp; While it is that way now, I know it wasn't always such.&nbsp; It's all very interesting to think about.&nbsp; Just stop and think of what a tremendous bond they have, my F- &amp; M-I-L.&nbsp; Now there is one committed couple.&nbsp; But enough about me, how are you?     &nbsp;   I've been in a bit of an upper mood.&nbsp; I don't have a clue why, but everyone is benefiting.&nbsp; I think it may be the suspension of my life while staying at the in-laws.&nbsp; I didn't have to answer the phone, hide from the friends and neighbors that drop by, or clean the house, HA!&nbsp; Yup, that could be it.&nbsp; Not to say we didn't have friends and neighbors stop by and see us&nbsp;at the in-laws, but it was a bit different.&nbsp; Folks who don't usually "pop over for a cold one" were stopping by, which is a nice change from the ordinary.&nbsp; So now it's back to the usual, the normal, the routine, the monotony of my everyday life.&nbsp; Oh, and another g.d. dental appointment.

       I LOVE that song, not the NSYNC version, but the good one.&nbsp; It just sets the mood for Fridays and gears you up for the weekend.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I have yet to see an episode of the I Love the 90’s on VH1.&nbsp; Everyone is talking about it, and I’m DYING to see it, but at last, it is not to be.&nbsp; I know I have no reason to worry, as VH1 reruns everything about at as much as E TV, which translates to constant reruns.  &nbsp;  I got my teeth bleached yesterday.&nbsp; Let me just tell you, that experience is not fun.&nbsp; This was yet another trip to the dentist office due to my drunken 19-year-old sorority girl night.&nbsp; Only, it’s not so fun when you’re 27 and married.&nbsp; Thank goodness I don’t have children.&nbsp; I think that’s the only thing keeping me from jumping off a bridge in complete despair.&nbsp; So, the bleaching.&nbsp; They put this blue goop, technical term, over your gums so that the lighting agent doesn’t come in contact with your gums, as it will “burn” the skin.&nbsp; All the time your mouth is stretched into a very unnatural position, which is extremely conducive to drool oozing down one’s chin, classy.&nbsp; There is a UV type light, similar to a tanning bed light, that is positioned about 2 inches from your mouth for about 20 minutes.&nbsp; You are to do 3 20 minutes sessions.&nbsp; I have a pretty high tolerance for pain, and went through 2 root canals within a day of each other, and the pain from that was NOTHING compared to the bleach.&nbsp; The first session was fine.&nbsp; Towards the end of the 2nd session, pain, pain, pain, everywhere.&nbsp; My teeth got super-ultra- (sounds like a tampon description) sensitive (or a really good condom) and I was dying for the last 10 minutes or so.&nbsp; I decided that I would try the 3rd session, because I was there and hey, why not?&nbsp; But what we, or the tech did was put the bleach just on the upper teeth.&nbsp; I could only hang in there for 10 minutes and I was done.&nbsp; The pain was so bad.&nbsp; After the appt. I took about 800mg of ibuprofen and 2 valiums.&nbsp; It didn’t work.&nbsp; So, after dinner, we decided to make the round in the neighborhood and after about 4 screwdrivers, I was feeling all right.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact my hubs was happy with ensuing side effects of alcohol consumption.  &nbsp;I’m going to visit my cousin’s baby tomorrow.&nbsp; I haven’t met him yet and I can’t wait.&nbsp; His pictures are so adorable.&nbsp; AH, I want one.

      Vegas, what a town!  Left Friday evening for Vegas, arrived at the hotel around 9 p.m.  We met the crew at the restaurant they were dining at.  The bride had a cute pink feather head dress on.  She cracks me up!  We went to The Foundation Room, what a view.  That has got to be one of the best views in Vega, Rain might be better, but I doubt it.  Had a couple pops there and then returned to party central for a midnight toast.  That was wonderful and then we went on to Rum Jungle.  After a few (who was counting) shots and a couple drinks (OK, I wasnt counting, so it couldve been a bit more) we danced until the joint closed down.  Then got waylaid into an after-hours club called Lust.  I think that was my downfall.  I stayed for a couple drinks and then ditched everyone to go and eat something so I wouldnt get ill in the morning.  I got to my bed around 5:30 a.m.  Saturday I lounged all day, never went outside until our trip to the nightclub.  So we had a bit of a party until 10 or 11 and then went to the Hard Rock.  We went to some VIP club that was crazy fun, but way over crowded.  Had a few celebratory shots for the bride and partied til our feet were ready to fall off.  Thank the lord for Red Bull and Vodka.  We left there and went back to the Rum Jungle until closing, again.  Tried to ditch some crazy delusional man who thought the bride was his soul mate and be a good citizen and help the gal vomiting in the ladies restroom.  After that, the remaining 4, me included because Im an all-star, decided we should eat or be ill in the morning.  So, we ate and then I got to bed around 6:30 a.m.  Sunday morning was very similar to Saturday morning, lounged until the last possible minute and then said good-bye to Vegas for a little while.  Im sure there is so much more that occurred, but how can you possibly remember everything.

       Hot Lap…did I do that one already?   Ok, so my drunken 19-year-old sorority girl night is ending up costing me a FORTUNE.  I’ve had one root canal, another tomorrow, may have to bleach my teeth, and then get 2 crowns, which cost a goddamn arm and leg.  I think my dentist office is totally over billing, but they were the only office that could get me in the Monday morning after my ‘trauma,’ so what’s a girl to do?  And my insurance covers less than 50% of each procedure, which is really cutting into my budget.  BUT, and this is a big but, all procedures performed have only been mildly uncomfortable for dental work vs. excruciatingly painful, and one really does not want to mess with one’s front teeth, or any visible tooth for that matter.  Sigh.  So, now that I’ve ranted on that topic, on to bigger and better things.  VEGAS.  I leave Friday and the bridesmaid organizing this PARTAY for my friend is a bit of an overachiever.  She has organized all, sent us not only an e-viite, but also a flier with a, wait for it, itinerary for the day.  I can only dream of being so organized.  I think I’m more envious than anything.  I know it will be a riot and there will be too many stories to blog…although, for all of you with out a TV to see the ad campaign promoting debauchery, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, which happens to be the same motto for my bachelorette party.  I didn’t go to one organized 4th of July event this year.  I am so proud of myself.  Hit a friendly BBQ, walked around the block with a couple road sodas and watched the little tykes playing with sparklers.  To be young and carefree.

       Willy Wonka:  And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything  he'd ever wished for.   Charlie:  What happened?   Willy Wonka:  He lived happily ever after.  Is it so simple?  WHO IS RUNNING A GODDAMN MARATHON UPSTAIRS??????  Sorry, it just irritated me.  I’m trying to be happy, but it’s not working for me.  I don’t understand what it is about me.  I’m hardly in a “good mood” just because, there does have to be a reason.  Usually it has to do with my hubs, but there are a few friends who put a smile on my face.  I am a pessimist by nature, that much I know.  I don’t wait for bad things to happen, I just know they will.  It’s not like I can’t enjoy happiness when it comes along because I’m waiting for “the other shoe to drop.”  I think a lot of it has to do with “finding myself.”  I don’t know what’s going to make me happy.  I guess I just have to go out and try a bunch of different things, try’em on for size.  I’m just counting the days and marking them off until…what?  I feel like a cartoon prisoner marking off the days, in groups of five, on the cell wall.  I don’t know.  I’m waiting for that thing, that something wonderful that’s just around the corner, that some kind of wonderful that’s going to let me live happily ever after.

       I think I may be reusing these things.  So, I mentioned previously that last weekend (2 Saturday’s ago) my hubs and I went to a dinner party.  I was the DD, which I am still pretty proud about, and as we were driving to our house I think I had one of those “once in a lifetime” moments.  Let me give you a bit of history.  Our house is on a corner lot and we live across from the high school football field.  We are one block down from a pretty major street and get a fair amount of traffic.  Well, we are headed to our house from the street that comes up behind it and I'm stopping at the stop sign with our house immediately to our right.  Well, I did make a full stop, complete cessation of movement, and looked over and saw what I thought to be a dog or big bag of garbage on my lawn.  As we looked a bit closer we realized it was a couple getting it on, ON MY FRONT LAWN.  I rolled down the window and yelled, “Get a room” and my hubs yelled, “Get it done.”  The differences in the sexes.  So, I continued around the turn and into our driveway, and yelled again for the freaks to get a room and they left down the street holding hands.  I’ve probably told that story 10 times in the last week, because who comes home to find folks having sex on your lawn?  But it gets better.  Friday, just this one passed, my hubs was out in the garage doing some work when our neighbor and her daughter stopped by, they were out walking their dog.  Here’s the convo  Hubs: How’s your son getting along with the new girlfriend? Mom: You know, you saw him last weekend. Hubs: What are you taking about? I didn’t see him last weekend. Mom: Yeah, you found them on you lawn Saturday night.  I don’t know how he responded, because I probably would’ve peed my pants at that point.  So, the scoop is Mom kicked them out for some reason, mainly to do with making out in the boy’s bedroom, and they found their way to our lawn just around the corner.  The thing is, there’s a football field across the street, where cars can’t see you.  Why stop on our lawn that gets a good amount of traffic.  AND why tell your mom?????  We didn’t even think twice that it was one of these kids.  We thought they were smarter than that.    Wow, that’s a long ramble.  I’ll type about this weekend later.

       I’ve been thinking (I know, I know, but I still have to do it every once in awhile) that I don’t really know how to do this whole blog thing.  Is it just an online diary?  Or a page dedicated to “you”?  I don’t even know how to link to things I like out in cyber-space.  I think I’m going to do one of those lists.  You know the one that everybody’s doing listing 10, 50, 100 things about themselves.  So, I figure I can start small, and keep adding.  Here is the Top 10, which means 10 things off the top of my head:   1.  I’m the oldest. 2.  I’m named after my father’s mother. 3.  I’m married to THE greatest guy. 4.  I’m afraid to be a mom. 5.  I’m afraid of becoming my mother. 6.  If I could, I would sleep with a nightlight. 7.  I HATE talking about myself. 8.  I don’t want to attend my 10 year H.S. reunion 9.  “Take on me” is my ring tone, and playing on the radio right now. 10.I love the 80’s.

      What a weekend.  We went to the drag races Friday night, got into a heated political argument, and got home after stopping at Safeway for a midnight munchie.  Saturday I slept in while my hubs left the house at 5:30 a.m., poor hubs.  Then did some laundry, headed to the company picnic, won a game of horse shoes, then came home, did some more laundry, took a bit of a nap (15 minutes DOES NOT equal nap), then freshened up for the party.  We weren’t out too late, and I was the DD and am proud of myself for actually stopping the consumption of alcohol and drinking water.  We left for the Giants game at 2:30, after entertaining 2 guests.  We sat in front of this gal who would not stop talking.  No, she really didn’t stop talking.  Maybe for about 4 minutes when her friend went to the bathroom, but that was it.  I haven’t a clue how people do it.  We are going to start painting our bedroom.  We have to move everything out of junk room number 2 so I can move everything from the guest room in there.  Then we have to move everything from our room to either the guest room or junk room number 2, or junk room number 1, or the garage.  I think it may be time for me to throw things away.  We are going to remove the “popcorn” crap on our ceiling, which I am REALLY excited about, and paint the walls red.  Kinda brick colored.  And then we’ll work on either our bathroom, or junk room number 2, depending on what happens this month.  It will be so nice when the house is actually decorated.  It will have it’s own personality and feel like a home.  Not that it doesn’t now; it’s just a bunch of stuff thrown together.  And we’re getting an awesome new couch.  YIPEE.
