						   Oh well, you've got me under your spell  and I don't think that I'm kidding around.  I don't think I can forget you now.  I once sat up on my roof and examined the planning of my town.  I saw the structured grid and pavement cutting through grass  and I remembered the cold of winter running up the legs of my pants.  I picked the nicest lawn and imagined the two of us  rolling around down along the ground.  I saw myself touch your face and I noticed jets begin to race above our heads.  But I pinched my arm and remembered how much you hate me.  I remembered the fact that I can't see what you need  and I'm too stupid to be aware of the beauty that you give this place  and how shitty this town would seem without you in it.  When you aren't around I let the shades fall down to shut out  all the sun's light and make myself feel all right.  What am I doing with my life?  Remember that the only things we need sometimes  are chilly nights and warmer thighs, 'cause there's nothing like being held.  Saves The Day- Hold

						   I slept at ryans house last night. That was ok. Around 9 last night i left my house to meet up with robin and stephanie at peace park, then ryan joined. We meet some people there and we all played lava. it was a good game, didnt last long though, but good none the less. Then we all went back to ryans house. joey, shane, and caitlin came over to. Thats when the guilt trip started. See i didnt mind hanging out with her its just that it seems like everytime we talk now she brings a fucking guilt trip on. And not to mention last night wayne was helping her. But after wayne and caitlin and ryan and shane left for a while me and joey talked. Joey agrees with me that im doing the right thing because he had the same thing happen in his relationship except he was on the recieving end. He said its better that i suggested me and caitlin take a break because if i wouldnt have then we probably would have broken up in a really horrible way. By having a break we both have the ability to think things through, on were we are in our relationship, how we feel, what we need to do to get everything straightend out. I only wish she understood it that way. It seems the only way she sees it is by thinking im slowly breaking up with her and i should feel sorry for what ive done. As i told her before i dont know what the outcome of this break will be we could get back together or we could stay apart, i just dont know. But until then everyone that thinks im wrong can keep their opinons to themselves because this is not your decision.

						   ok the reason im putting this song in here is because its very poetic. so you should read it, you will like it.   We sent out the S.O.S. call.  It was a quarter past four, in the morning  When the storm broke our second anchor line.  Four months at sea. Four months of calm seas only  To be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point.   They call them rogues. They travel fast and alone.  One hundred foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong.  What they call love is a risk,  Cause you will always get hit  Out of nowhere by some wave  And end up on your own.   The hole in the hull defied the crewâ€™s attempts, To bail us out. And flooded the engines and radio, And half buried bow.   Your tongue is a rudder.  It steers the whole ship.  Sends your words past your lips  Or keeps them safe behind your teeth.  But the wrong words will strand you.  Come off course while you sleep.  Sweep your boat out to sea  Or dashed to bits on the reef.   The vessel groans  The ocean pressures its frame.  To the port I see the lighthouse  Through the sleet and the rain.  And I wish for one more day to give my  Love and repay debts.  But the morning finds our bodies washed up thirty miles west.   They say that the captain stays fast with the ship, Through still and storm, But this ain't the Dakota, And the water is cold,  We won't have to fight for long.   (This is the end.) This story's old but it goes on and on until we disappear, (This is the calm.) Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed while you were underneath, (We are the mountains.) I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains sunk below the sea, (After the storm.) I spoke the words but never gave a thought of what they all could mean, (Rest in the sea.) I know that this is what you want, A funeral keeps both of us apart. (Washed up on the beach.) You know that you are not alone I need you like water in my lungs. (This is the end.)  Brand New- Play Crack The Sky

						   so im starting a new blog. i just felt the urge to write.  so my first post isnt really a good one. me and caitlin are taking a break. im the one that suggested it, and its because i am under way to much stress. it felt like our relationship was going downhill. we began to fight about little things. she never seemed happy and i felt like i had to be strong all the time. the stress built up until i cracked. now we are apart. i do not know how long it will last, i dont know if we will get back together or not. all i know right now is that we need to be apart so we can both work things out. but i dont know.  My brothers having about 20 kids over at our house for a party tonight, so that means im leaving. i have to find somewhere to sleep. i just know there going to go into my room..... bastards.

						   I dont know how anybody else would feel about this but i feel very let down. When me and caitlin broke up she said she was going to keep all the promises she made to herself. She said she wasnt going to drink, smoke cigarettes again, or smoke weed again.  Well last night she smoked weed, and right before she did she promised me she wasnt going to do that, she said she had more respect for herself.&nbsp; I know i dont have a right to tell her what to do or not to do, she can do what she wants, but its the general promise that she broke that really hurts me the most. Out of all the people i know i thought she would be one of the few that has more respect for themselves than that. My overall respect for her has lowered now, i consider that one of the worst things somebody can do, make a promise to somebody and swear you will keep it and later on break it.&nbsp; Thats pretty low, and i feel really let down. &nbsp; "This song will become the anthem of your underground. You're two floors down getting high in the back room. If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out, or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?&nbsp;And at your funeral I will sing the requiem. I'd offer you my hand, it would hurt too much to watch you die."

						   i got paid today. $127.25 and i left my house at 3 o'clock, i got back at 4:30 and i only have $26.25 left. But the money went to a good cause, first i got a full tank of gas, then i went to the mall and bought my warped tour ticket, it was $34.00 even. After that i went and bought some shorts, yes i know what your all thinking, "Adam doesnt wear shorts! Why did he buy some?!" well i will tell you why i bought some. im not going to be walking around warped tour all day in jeans. so i bought some long dickies black shorts. so its all good. &nbsp; Now im really bored. everybody works today, and doesnt get done until later. so now im watching King Of The Hill. Yeah this post is pretty un-exciting so im going to go. sorry to bore all of you but i just thought i would post to pass the time. &nbsp; "I dont know why, but didnt ask questions because it was the first time in my life, yeah the first time in my life, where i did something right. I set myself up for the greatest fall of all time"

						   the title of this post is a song title from Hot Rod Circuit. i dont know why i picked that as the title but i did haha. i havent posted in a couple of days. and i dont know why, nothing really to talk about. Guess what! my car is dying :( it keeps over heating so i cant drive it until it gets fixed *tear*. it first happened when me and stephanie were taking a tire iron to ryan who had a flat, i noticed my heat gage was all the way in the red (around 300 degrees for all of you that dont know) and my car began to smoke. long story short it happened 2 days in a row so now i cant drive.   Today i had to go to the doctor and get my toenail cut out again, i realized if i wasnt so stupid and would stop dropping boxes and getting my feet smashed this would never happen. yeah it was easy, this is the second time ive had to get it done. The procedure goes as follows: Step 1) Get 2 shots into your toe knuckle causing it to swell and go numb. Step 2) Get scissors and chop off all the skin around the nail. Step 3) Get very sharp scissors and pull the nail out of this skin causing blood to drip everywhere. Step 4) wrap up toe and walk around for 4 hours with a swollen toe. Thats about everything.  I have to work tonight 5-8 grrr. i dont like to work, i feel everyone should get paid for living. i mean come on being alive and being a teenager is the hardest job ever. not to mention all the money we require to live. I think that we should get paid $10 an hour for being a kid. and we get paid every day at 8 o'clock at night. that would be cool.  Warped tour is 6 days away! Alkaline Trio here i come!  "Smoke it down Until you smell the flesh burning from your finger tips You're knuckles are white From beating on the walls at night Cast your worries to the side Focus only when you get the time Gonna lose your mind It happens all the time  Maybe I can tell you To keep your head up and follow through Good things will come to you I could worry myself to death about you Hope you get there safely"

						   worked another 5-12 shift. It was ok except its gets sooooo boring around 10 o'clock and theres nothing to do. so i throw tomatoes at the wall, yeah its fun. So today i woke up at 11 and sat on my ass until 4, then i went to work, so that means i really didnt do much today. I work again tomorrow, grrrrr, but at least its only 5-8 and i dont have to work on tuesday! hurray!  Ive had the song "Brickwall views" by The Lawrence Arms stuck in my head all day long. "Dont break to many hearts, dont take to many arrows in the chest, cry comfortably and let us all know what your thinking....."  Sorry but i love that verse so i had to type it. I want to do something tomorrow after work so i think i might give shane a call or something. We are going to go buy our warped tour tickets on saturday, WOOT! dont you just love that word? woot. its such a good word. Im drinking Mountain Dew Live Wire, ITS GOOD STUFF! wow i have used the exclimation point alot and i dont know why. i have realized that and exclimation point makes any word look 10 times better, observe. Donkey. Donkey! see the "donkey" on the right is cooler. Capitals with an exclimation point just makes that word superb, observe again. Donkey! DONKEY!. See the "donkey" with the exclimation point is great but the capitalized "donkey" with and exclimation point just kicks the other donkeys ass.  I noticed that if i keep my hand in one postion for a while my thumb begins to go up and down by itself until i stop it. its like my thumb is trying to run away.  This post means nothing

						   Its over. me and caitlin are apart now, i told her thats what i want today on the phone. I called her while i was at work, i know thats not how you should tell someone the relationship is over but i couldnt wait, i had to tell her, i didnt want her to wait longer thinking that we would get back together when in my mind i knew it wasnt supposed to be that way. I know a beak up is never a good thing but i feel that we needed it, i needed it anyway, she told me she didnt want it but in the end i know she will realize it was for the best reasons. I told her on the phone though that we are not going to stop hanging out, i told her i want her to be my best friend i never want to lose the closeness we have. Yeah it will be awkward for a few days, but as time rolls on i know it will all be like it should be. I know she doesnt like the decision i made but i know she respects it. Im still going to be here for her whenever she needs anything at all. I am never going to stop talking to her. Just because our "dating relationship" is over doesnt mean our "best friends relationship" has to end to. thats about all i have to say.  Its 3:20 in the morning. Im going to bed

						   just got home from work not to long ago. worked 5-11, did nothing all day except that. Woke up around 11 and watched Resident Evil, thats all. I&nbsp;think im going to do the same tomorrow but watch a different movie instead. Heres my work schedule for the next few days:  Sunday: 5-11 Monday- Dont work Tuesday- Dont work Wednesday- 5-8 Thursday- Dont work Friday- Dont work Saturday- 5-11 Sunday- 5-11  Thats how my schedule usually is but i dont really complain about it unless i dont want to work. Ive been thinking about it and my summer has been going very very well. I get to see my friends alot, i get outside the house, i have money. Yeah i would say my summer is one of the best ones ive had.  I like my friends, and i noticed all my friends like my room, they say they want it or it is cool or&nbsp; " wish i had your room do you want mine?", i like it when people come over and hang out in my room. Brittany and Vanessa have been coming over at like 11 and have been leaving around 2 something, all we do is stay in my room, its cool because.......my room is cool haha. I wish they would get back from florida so we can chill in my room at night! haha  Im watching Predator, its a very good movie. I cant wait for a.v.p (Aiens Vs. Predator) it looks like it will be a good movie (in my opinion).  Has anyone noticed that all of my posts are nothing of real importance? there just kind of pointless and dont really mean anything.

						   His eyes they closed and his last breath spoke he had seen all to be seen A life once full, now an empty vase Wilt the blossums on his early grave Walk away me boy, walk away me boy And by mornin' we'll be free Wipe that golden tear from your mother dear And raise what's left of the flag for me Then the rosary beads count them one, two, three Fell apart as they hit the floor In our garb of black we must pay respect To the colour we're born to mourn Walk away me boys, walk away me boys And by morning we'll be free Wipe that golden tear from your mother dear And raise what's left of the flag for me In his place there grew an angry festered wound Filled with hatred and remorse Where I'd pick and scratch till the blood it matched The silent rage not that fills my lungs For there are many ways to kill a man they say With bayonet, axe, or sword But son a bullet fired from a shapeless guise Leaves but the shell of a Thompson gun Walk away me boys, walk away me boys And by morning we'll be free Wipe that golden tear from your mother dear And raise what's left of the flag for me From the East out to the Western shore Where many men and many more will fall But no angel flies with me tonight Till freedom reigns on all And curse the name for which we slaved our days Till every man shall his kingdom come But sure as night turns day Ends the passion play Oh my god what have they done With madman's rage, well they dug our graves But the dead rise again you fools Walk away me boys, walk away me boys And by morning we'll be free  Wipe that golden tear from your mother dear And raise what's left of the flag for me Walk away me boys, walk away me boys And by morning we'll be free Wipe that golden tear from your mother dear And raise what's left of the flag for me  Flogging Molly - Whats left of the flag

Hahaha last night me and shane went to lustig park and saw to people having sex in the woods right next to the road and we stopped the car and i asked the guy how to get to arbys (at this point they were doing it doggy style, he had his penis in her vagina and they were going strong) and he gave us directions! haha he gave us directions while they were having sex, it was the funniest thing ever, they didnt stop or even looked shocked. haha  Im very bored so im going to go finish installing things on the computer.   &nbsp; I love how my life is going :)

						   yes, warped tour was very awesome and unique. For starters all the bands rocked, i got the guitarists pick from the f-ups, i got my picture with #2 from anti-flag, i got my picture with the bassist from Taking Back Sunday, i got my picture with the guitarist from the f-ups. It was so awesome all the bands rocked, i saw The F-Ups, Anti-Flag, Rufio, Avenged Sevenfold (from afar), and i saw Alkaine Trio, thats where the warped tour got very unique. Alkaline Trio was amazing the crowd was so pumped and jumping around and crowd surfing and get so crazy the security guards were just pulling people out. Well when matt skiba came up to the front of that stage i was going to take a picture so i raised my camera and all of a sudded BAM, the next thing i remember was standing up off the ground and yelling for a security guard to pull me out of the crowd. It turns out a crowd surfer kicked me in the back of the head so hard i blacked out and instantly fell to the ground. after i got taken out of the crowd they took me over to the paramedics, they asked me all of the questions, were do i live, how old am i, whos my parents. and i after i told them they put a neck brace on me and strapped me to a board and took me to the hospital in the ambulence. They had to take me to the hospital because since i blacked out and had pains in my neck they thought i could have internal bleeding (from what the doctor told me). So when i got to the hospital i had to get about 8 x-rays of my neck and then i had to get a catscan for my head. Thank god nothing was seriously wrong, they found that my neck muscles are all stuck together and are pinching all the nerves in my neck but other than that i will have a stiff neck and pain for a couple of days nothing really to worry about. Wayne and Kurt came to the hospital and we all had to wait before they would discharge me. Overall i was at the hospital for about 4 hours and 45 min. On they way home though i got a super taco :)

						   yeah my basement smells horrible so that means im going to blame it on my brother and sister. They smell bad so hencer forth the basement smells bad. &nbsp; Im very bored, im waiting around my house watching televsion. im waiting for shane to get done with work so we&nbsp;can go to waynes and from their were all going to milwaukee to stay at waynes dads for the night and tomorrow were going to warped tour! Hurray! i cant wait, man im pumped i mean come on. I finally get to see my favorite band, the one band that i think is better than every other band out there. yes folks you guessed it, im talking about Alkaline Trio. yes their going to be playing at warped tour and im going to be in the front row taking as many pictures as i can. God i hope they play sleepyhead and radio. &nbsp; Im watching "Battlefield history of the United States Airforce"&nbsp;on the history channel. its a good show, but i dont really know why im watching it. I guess its because the tv was already on that channel when i turned it on but who knows. &nbsp; Oh man my toe hurts, its all blistered and bloody and scabbed and it hurts to move and it hurts to walk and i keep having to pop blisters. Its probably infected with something but im to much of a lazy ass to do anything about it. watch it will fall off in a couple of days and then i will be screwed. But until that happens i will keep being lazy. &nbsp; Im hungry, i want barbecue chicken and mashed potatos and ribs. Thats what i want.........but i dont have it

						   I saw the new M. Night movie The Village. Let me tell you, that movie is crazy. It its scary, its is lovey, it is funny, and like all of his other movies it has a HUGE TWIST. but im not going to give that away. all im going to say is GO SEE IT!!!!  I got paid $143.00 today. Currently in my wallet i have $16.00, man lets see what i bought today:  1.) Taking Back Sunday- Where you want to be ( oh my god, can you say extremely awesome? This cd is amazing, the music actually sucks you in and doesnt let you go until the cd is over, and then from that point you just want to play it again, ive listened to it 7 times today already) 2.) The Unseen- The anger and the truth 3.) Bad Religon- The empire strikes first (if you havent caught on those are all cd's, those cd's cost $32.00 dollars total) 4.) Hellboy special edition 2 disc dvd 5.) $18.77 worth of gas ( a full tank) 6.) 2 magazines 7.) The Village movie ticket, $8.00  That is everything i bought today. i should really not be allowed to hold onto my own money, im horrible with it.  Hahaha after the movie we went over to brittanys house (Me, Vanessa, Brittany, Preston) and we ate food and ran around. Me and vanessa gave each other wedgies and i mean major wedgies, the kind where your butt hurts for a little bit after you pick them out haha. Then after vanessa left brittany got really scared because she thinks the ghost of abraham lincoln is in her house, so of course me and preston had to scare her even more. it was fun.  Tonight im going to sleep until 3pm tomorrow because i have to work from 5 to 11, and then i have to do it again on sunday, and then on monday i work 5-8, tuesday i work 5-7 and wednesday i work 5-8. man, i work alot. you should all feel sorry for me.  Lately i have been feeling really really good, i have no pressure on me and i can pretty much do what i want. me and my dad and my brother are all getting along, my dad is letting me go places and not saying no. lately everything has been going my way. i feel good, very good. i want to feel like this forever.  I had a mountain dew and now im not tired :)

GOD PEOPLE YOU WOKE ME UP! ITS ONLY 11:43AM. if i find you people im going to kill every child you ever have so i can take away every ounce of happiness a person deserves. let this be a warning.  with that said. i got an awesome bad religon poster from lis last night and a whole bunch of stickers, i have no clue where im going to put them all, but they, i will find a place. i just got the strangest urge to make corn and i dont know why. but yeah, im out. i may post later i may not. be happy with what you got haha.   i want to see how many people read this, so if you stop by then please post. thanks, adam

						   i swear to god its like 90 degrees outside. but yet i wont wear shorts, i only have 1 pair and i rarely wear those.  i havent really been up to much lately. ive been working, thats about it. Yesterday me and shane hung out, we didnt have anything to do so we went to exclusive company and found these awesome stickers that say "god doesnt care" thats it, theres nothing else on them, there red stickers with white letters and that simple phrase. there cool. So after we left exclusive we went to sinners and saints (the tattoo place) and we were there for 2 hours. we just hung out with the guys that work there, there all really really awesome people. it would be cool to work there. So i got really bored while i was there so i began drawing, i drew a skull with wings coming out the side and its flying over a headstone and grave. Well shane thought it was cool and so did they guy that draws the tattoos so he said he would "polish" it up and shane put a down payment on it. so that means shane is getting my drawing tattooed on the back of his arm. thats awesome.  man, im in a really bland mood today, im not mad or happy or sad or tired, just bored. so i dont really have anything to write about.  I got the new AP, taking back sunday is on the cover and there is a really good article about them inside. so i suggest if you like TBS then you should go read it.  I signed up for the Alkaline Trio Blood Pact yesterday. its a fan club. and when you send away to join you get a t-shirt, a poster, a bag, a membership card, a button, pin, sticker, patch. it cost $34.20 to join.  AHHHHH MY HEAD IS EMPTY AND I HAVE NOTHING TO BLOG ABOUT!

						   I dont really have anything to write about so i figured i would just post a very good alkaline trio song. so here it is  You were like a toilet bowl at the end of the rainbow Something like a pot of gold stuck under my pillow Keeping me up at night you kept my head spinning And wishing there were windows to throw you from Throw you from Day or night Fuck if I know Hard to tell with no fucking window And sundials What good are sundials once the sun is gone? What are you good for? And we laid in my bed like a train wreck And we both got laid like concrete And we fought like soldiers But we died.. we died like flies Day or night Fuck if I know Hard to tell with no fucking window And sundials What good are sundials once the sun is gone? What are you good for?  Alkaline Trio- Sundials

						   i know i know, you are all wondering "adam, what does bumpyat mean?" well children, i will tell you. Bumpyat is a word i made up. Bumpyat means, sexiest person ever. Yes my friend brittany is by far the best bumpyat ever! ;)  Ok, so today was very very good. I called work and faked sick so i didnt have to work today. Then later on ryan picked me up and he paid me the $20 he owed me, so we went to exclusive and for the first time ever i found Alkaline Trios selftitled cd and maybe ill catch fire. They were just sitting there in the front of all the other cds. So instinctively i bought them. the total came to $20.98. thats not bad for 2 very kick ass cds. Man, those guys are so good. If you havent heard them then go listen to them and you will discover why they are my favorite band!  haha brittany and vanessa came over and as usual it was a fun time. brittany left early because she was down and we wanted her to cheer up so she went home. so it was just me and vanessa. Hahaha we beat the crap out of each other for about an hour straight, i mean there were wedgies, slapping, kicking, punching, pinching, and licking. yes folks licking. hahah we were licking each others faces and it was very salivaish. After a little while i pinned vanessa and i found out where she was ticklish! haha i used that to my advantage, haha she couldnt get away, i was on top of her just tickling away. she was squirmming so much, i dont think ive every seen anyone squirm like that haha. it was very hilarious.  i realized i drink alot of mountain dew. and i got to thinking, what if one day im enjoying a dew outside and i accidentally wonder onto a set of train tracks and i get hit by a train. Man that would suck. I bet i would crap my pants mega tons because when you die you poop your pants and i mean come on, getting hit by a train would make anyone shit bricks.

I called into work this morning and told my boss that i was sick and i couldnt work my 5-8 shift (but im not really sick, i just dont want to go) and i think she could tell that i was faking because she said "get a doctors excuse" and then she slammed down the phone. But i dont care im not going to work today, last night i worked 5pm to 1:27am. I was very pissed about that so today im like screw it im not going to work today. so im not going to.  nothing to post about, so im out

						   so i woke up today at ryans and i left there at about 12 something. i came home and sat around. shane called me so we went and hung out. we did nothing for about 4 hours. then we found a paper bag in the back of his car, we also found a pen. we wrote on the paper back and it said "we are bored! wanna hang out? Please!" and we drove around with that and showed people. after we got tired with that we took the sign into the mall, haha thats where the fun began.  apparently carrying around a paper bag with words on it is considered disturbing the peace. The mall pigs were not to happy, they said we were causing a disturbance and stores were calling the pigs on us saying we were bothering them. But thats not true everyone said our sign was funny and cool, people even came out of their stores to look at it. So the pigs took away our sign and me being a smart ass debated with them, shane stepped in every so often as well. Me and the pig argued about how he thought the paper bag was a disturbance and i how i knew it wasnt. We also aruged about how you can wear shirts that say "show me your boobs" in the mall but for some reason you cannot carry around a bag that says "we are bored, wanna hang out. please". So me and the pig aruged for at least 25 min. he was saying things like "i have already told you 50 times that you need to leave" and i responded with a smart ass comment like "ummm no sir you have only told us 10 times, remember, ive been counting" it was very fun. but then he said he was going to call the real police on us and have us arrested haha yeah i would like to see how that would hold up in court. "Your honor these children were walking around the mall with a paper bag, i think they should be arrrested" "Is that all? why thats the stupidest thing i have ever heard, case dismissed"  We also met some cool girls from whitewater on the strip tonight. Hurray! we have made new friends!

						   how come when you wake up in the morning your fingers are stiff and feel weird to move? maybe its just me that has that problem. but i really want to know why.  yesterday i bought 2 new cd's. Rock Against Bush vol. 2 and Halfwayhome. The new rock against bush features bands such as: Green Day, The Unseen, The International Noise Conspiracy, The Casualties, Flogging Molly, The Lawrence Arms and many many more. The Dvd included with the cd includes music videos from Alkaline Trio, Bad Religon, NOFX, and Thought Riot. its got comedy from Will Ferell and Greg Proobs and Patton Oswalt. Go get it!  The other cd i got is Halfwayhome. ive never heard of them before but the thing that sucked me into buying them was on the cover of the cd was a sticker that said "If you are a fan of Thrice, Taking Back Sunday, and Saves The Day then buy this cd!" so i bought it. and oh my god, the cd is amazing! the songs are awesome, the lyrics are awesome, and the sound is awesome. it was also only $10.47 so i suggest everyone go out and buy it..............NOW!  summer is almost over, school starts septemeber 1st. Soccer starts next monday (the 16th), two practices everyday one 8-11 and the other one 1-3........im going to die. just like every other year. then after soccer is done (the whole season in general) im just going to walk around school the rest of the year like i have done for every other school year. And this is my senior year so after this one is done im going to have to walk around janesville. haha. janesville sucks. im just rambling now. so im going to go bye

						   i just got done work and now im sitting at home. its 11:33. and i have nothing to post about, i worked yesteday and today, thats about it. nothing interesting has happened. tomorrow im actually going to leave my house and go do something. so heres a song to keep you entertained. bye  Yeah, everything bothers me Just about everything that I see No need for a flag or a country Raise your finger if you agree The problems won't go away If we keep our rage at bay The filth and slime will always stay If we choose to ignore and play The stars and strips are prison bars They won't let you get too far The rule over many, by the few You can't police my mind 'cause I won't let you Goodbye America! Fuck you America! Pledge allegiance to yourself Not greed, power, war, and wealth Remember you were born a HUMAN BEINGNOT A PART OF THEIR MACHINE Goodbye America! Fuck you America! NO MORE SOCIAL ORDER.  The Unseen- Goodbye America
