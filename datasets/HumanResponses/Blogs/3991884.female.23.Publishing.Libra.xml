        A few days ago, my rough draft was covering the Philadelphia Black Women’s Arts Festival was returned to me from Mike, an editor at    urlLink PAW …I, of course, assumed the piece would be returned intact with a note graciously thanking me for my submission. What I received instead was, at first glance, a brutal massacre of the masterpiece I thought I’d created. I didn’t make this assumption because I’m arrogant, but because I poured my heart and soul into my work and because I believe that I have a talent.  Before I put pen to paper, I vowed to myself to bring warmth and humanism into my pieces because I’ve read so many articles that read like book reports. To my dismay, I learned that I had put too much of myself into my work. I created an op-ed piece—not an article.  I should mention here that your beloved aspiring journalist has never taken a course in Journalism. When pursuing my undergraduate degree in English, I never elected to take such a course because it didn’t interest me at the time. I thought having a firm grasp on the mechanics of writing and knowledge of English literature would be more than enough to advance me in any field involving the written word. However, now I feel differently, and that’s the most exciting part of it all! I’m actually glad I don’t know all there is to know about Journalism. This is a new experience for me and I’m sure that there is so much more to learn about the art and design of the many genres of the written word. I love to write and more importantly, I love to learn.  Honestly, Mike was very kind to me in his critique. It was evident that he put just as much time and care in his review of my article as I had put in writing the damn thing. Mike even noticed how much I cared about my subject through my execution, encouraged me to express my passion  properly , and (the best part) said that I have a gift.  As soon as I could, or rather, as soon my ego recovered, I poured over, evaluated and digested Mike’s comments; I also researched the aspects of journalistic writing. Here is what I learned…   Apparently, there are elements to Journalism...  (and I thought I could just wing it!)   1.   Quotes/Testimony   2.   Eyewitness accounts     3 .    Facts and/or documented evidence (other articles in the media, speeches, recordings, achievements, awards, etc)   4.   References, written or broadcast   5.   Personal observation (not to be confused with personal opinion)  ~One must act as a reporter and prove her case through fact; the reporter’s emotions cannot interfere with the facts.  ~Additionally a reporter cannot make up her reader’s minds for them. She must present the facts so that they can draw their own conclusions. Facts can be vividly outlined and emotions can be conveyed through description and example. Facts cited in the article must be verifiable, if a point is cannot be verified, it isn’t a fact is it?  ~A reporter runs the risk of seeming arrogant if she assumes what she is trying to convey is readily apparent. A reporter also runs the risk of diminishing her talent and voice with heavily opinionated “articles”.  ~A reporter is an authority and should write like an authority; in most cases, an authority can prove her case through one of the five elements of journalism.  ~Most importantly, a journalist’s motto should be: Write to express, not impress.  Writing should be clear and concise. One should avoid clichés Flowery language is a no-no (is “no-no” a cliché?). Simple, strong verbs should be used instead of weak ones. Sentences should be short and simple. Concrete, not abstract, examples should be given.  Some other helpful web resources include:  urlLink What is clear writing? How should you do it?  A resource from the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food, written by Kevin Churchill - Southwestern Literacy Clearinghouse; Barb Shipley - Ontario Rural Literacy; Lynn McLaughlin – OMAF. Provides excellent tips.   urlLink Journalism.org  Need I say more?   urlLink Ten Principles of Clear Statement   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ So yes, I have a lot to learn but I believe that I can do this and I can’t wait to share my first article with you all.  © Sherella Gibbs

      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    I    used to feel slight (okay, major) pangs of jealousy whenever I saw a sharply dressed woman effortlessly gliding down the street as I trekked to work, lunch cooler in one hand, cheap coffee in the other. There’s a certain aura about a well put together woman, isn’t there? Unfortunately, life often gets in the way of my shopping sprees. If my junker of a car doesn’t need a new tire or what-have-you, then my damn stomach starts growling and I have to buy food to accompany the ketchup and hot sauce in my refrigerator. However, even on my starving artist budget (or your recent college-grad, first home buyer or new parent budget) a decent wardrobe is possible. And even though it may take some time to create your own aura, it can be accomplished in three easy steps and some creativity…     1. DEFINE &nbsp; your style  What’s your look? Conservative, boho-chic, sexy, relaxed, funky…?  Whatever type of look you feel great and most comfortable in is the best match for you.  I believe that personal style cannot be defined by category, quiz or trend—it’s a matter of personal preference. For instance, my personal style is always changing. When in high school, I was a straight hoochie-mamma, I think I considered pajama pants trousers in college, and now I’m shooting for a mix of glam, sporty and chic (a la Victoria Beckham on a “normal” day).     2.    FIND  shops (read: discount stores, outlets and the like) that house pieces which compliment your style.  Sure you can find great discount shops on the Internet, but the $5-10 off you may be lost in shipping and handling charges. If you are saving a significant amount of money, go for it, but always be aware of S&H (not a division of H&amp;M(link), which, by the way, is awesome!). Besides, the avid hunt for the discount you crave is far more exciting than sitting in front of a glaring computer screen. Look for retail stores downtown, ask your friends where they shop, stop someone on the street, anything goes.  Another great tactic is shopping off-season (for expensive, classic items): for Summer and Spring pieces, shop in August; for your Winter and Fall wardrobe, shop in March. When shopping off-season, high-end retail stores are your friends…     3.    SHOP  appropriately!  Treating yourself to a few items each payday is no crime; spending the rent money,however, is a major offense.  Stay away from credit cards, another bill nonetheless. If you cannot live without your plastic, only charge items that you can pay off in 2 to 3 months (you’ll accrue some interest, but I’m being realistic here).     *~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>~>~>     Here’s a little guide for your splurges…     $  5-25 dollars   $$  25-75   $$$  76 or more     Accessories    $     Hosiery    $   Sporty/ Casual Tops    $   Dresses (Spring/Summer)    $-$$   Dresses (Winter/Fall)    $$   Jackets    $$   Shoes    $$   Sweaters    $$   Trousers    $$   Coats  $$$   Belts    $ - $$$   Handbags    $- $$$   Jeans  $ - $$$   Scarves  $ - $$$   A “Good” Watch    $$ - $$$      *~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>*~>~>~>       And if you must shop online, here are some sites to start with:       urlLink XTC shoes     Celebrity clients include: Mary J.

                       Its 8a.m. and you’re sitting in the health clinic waiting for the results of your HIV test—alone! You’re worried about your health, your future and your livelihood—alone! But, in all fairness, you and you alone are to blame.      If you haven’t heard about the myriad of sexually transmitted diseases (some transferable without the actual act of sex, like oral herpes which can be transmitted through kissing) or know at least one person who regrets having children, then surely, you’ve been living under a rock. Everyday, be it at school, work or home, we see, hear, or read something new about the rise in HIV infection or soaring abortion rates among teens. Perhaps you’ve seen a billboard, read a pamphlet or overheard a conversation about abstinence, unwanted pregnancy or STD’s. Maybe you were watching TV and have seen or heard some innuendo about sex. Sex, it seems, is all around us. And even though everything you’ve heard about sex may not be particularly negative, I can say with some certainty that alarming and controversial information about sex is around us hovering, like a thick fog, everyday. I, of course, could be wrong, and if by some chance you haven’t heard anything about the risks of unprotected sex or just plain-old sex for that matter, its time to do some research.  Even with the prevalence and availability of information about the perils of unprotected sex, many of us are still doing the deed without any protection or method of contraception. This, however, is no phenomenon and I am prepared to offer a theory: Perhaps we aren’t asking ourselves some poignant questions before getting hot and heavy. Has sex become such a trivial matter that we are neglecting to do a little soul-searching before it initiates? I certainly don’t have all the answers, but I have come up with some important questions…  1.  AM I ASSERTIVE ENOUGH TO PROTECT MYSELF?   Imagine you and your partner are at the moment where you are just about to have sex. Libidos are up and clothes are off but the condom issue never comes up. Just then, it occurs to you: if something isn’t said within the next five seconds, you’ll be engaged in unprotected sex. Are you confident enough to bring it up? Or would you rather not spoil the mood/ embarrass yourself/ offend the other party? If you’ve ever been in this situation and were hesitant about being assertive about protection, then you may have a problem.  Unfortunately, many of us, young and old, have been in this situation and did not have enough guts to speak up about protecting ourselves. However, there is an easy solution and I’ll put it bluntly: If you are comfortable enough with yourself and your partner to share yourself with him or her, then you should be comfortable enough to ask about protection. This can be as simple as saying, “Shouldn’t we be using a condom?” or “Are you forgetting something?” Worried about your partner’s response? Don’t be-after stating you want to have protected sex assertively and confidently, the need for a snappy rebuttal in the event of a refusal is useless. If your partner is unwilling to use a condom, then what should come to mind might be the following: “How many other partners has he had unprotected sex with?” “How can she not care enough to protect herself from the inevitable?” Most importantly, before having sex, try asking yourself, “Am I assertive enough to insist on having protected sex?”  2.  DO I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTIONAL IMPLICATIONS?   I’m sure we have all heard of casual sex or maybe are friends with a “ho” or “player” (or, dare I say, may even be a “ho” or “player”). Since promiscuity is not at all unheard of, I think it’s probably safe to say we all have at least some familiarity with the concept. I, myself, know lots of men who love the idea of casual sex and purposely go to clubs, bars, picnics-anywhere women are, specifically looking for a one-night-stand. However, the women I know who love the idea have a different perspective about sex without commitment. For them, sex may just be a means to gain all the money, cars, jewelry and clothes their hearts desire. The idea is appealing on the surface because everyone is getting what he or she wants, right? But how many people think about the emotional implications of this so-called casual sex?  This adage is old but true: “There is no such thing as casual sex.” Sadly enough, most people don’t find any truth in this saying until they, ahem, take a stab at it. Again, I could be wrong, maybe some people can completely emotionally detach themselves from sex. However, after some deep probing with players, men and women alike, I get the idea that something is either left behind (respect, dignity) or taken along (regret or a nagging curiosity about a complete stranger) when these casual encounters begin to pile up. Take Tracie, who when her heart was broken at the tender age of fifteen, vowed to never get emotionally attached to another man again. Tracie quickly became a master of conning men into giving her whatever she wanted but realized, after years of playing men for money, that she’d gained nothing she couldn’t get on her own. “Lots of girls were jealous of me” says Tracie, “and I thought I really had it going on, but when I saw that I was alone, insecure and had no marketable skills to get a well-paying job, I felt stupid…And I regret to say this, but I felt like I had prostituted myself for nothing.” Now Tracie is going to college, while trying to heal deep-rooted emotional scars, regret, a loss of self-respect and cope with a syphilis diagnosis. “If I knew then what I know now,” she begins, “I would have never been the player I was…life is too short for that. I could have been married now or at least had a steady boyfriend-someone who cares about me, you know?” Tracie had devised detailed schemes, had everything figured out and was good at what she did, but neglected to consider her  own  feelings. But we can all take a lesson from Tracie by asking ourselves, “Am I ready for/do I understand the emotional implications of sex?” before rolling in the hay.  3.  DO I UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES (OR EVEN BELIEVE THEY EXIST)?   Chances are, you know someone who’s contracted a sexually transmitted disease. A recent report from the Hendrick Health System reports that  “ one in four sexually active Americans will be affected by an STD at some time in his or her life.” In addition, twenty-five percent of these infected people are between the ages of sixteen and nineteen. While some were “lucky” enough to contract something that was curable, for example, chlamydia, gonorrhea or syphilis, some were unfortunate enough to contract genital herpes, genital warts or HIV. Whatever the case, I guarantee you that this person would have never imagined it could have happened to him or her. Still, so many of people believe that they can look at someone and determine whether he or she has an STD based on appearance, demeanor, style, acquaintances, whatever. Even though common sense tells us that it is, in fact, impossible to look at someone and make a medical diagnosis, some people still continue to play this game of sexual Russian roulette, but why?  I firmly believe that people who think, albeit sometimes half-heartedly, that they can make medical diagnosis, without any medical tests, based on assumptions alone, really believe that they could never actually contract a sexually transmitted disease. I have no anecdotes for these types of people, nor can I give any examples or scenarios which could be extremely helpful; I can only plead with them to use a ounce of sound judgment and declare that they’d rather be safe than sorry, for those who have contracted an STD are truly sorry. If you are not worried about an STD, perhaps the loss of your freedom is a little more important. Simply put, once you become a parent, the freedom to think only about yourself is gone. You are immediately responsible for another human-being’s life. Children cost money and time, require constant care, and deserve to be born to responsible, caring parents. No one “asks” to be born and to have a child and be ill-prepared (financially and emotionally) is unfair to everyone involved. Similarly, there are options to “take care” of an unwanted pregnancy, but abortion and adoption are heavy emotional burdens to carry and because these burdens are emotional, they are not easily forgotten or resolved. Basically, try asking yourself (and being honest with the answer), “Do I understand the consequences of sex and truly believe they exist?”  This article began with a presumably hypothetical situation that is, unfortunately, played-out everyday, several times a day, across the nation. An ashamed, perhaps confused young woman (or man) walks into a clinic to be tested for HIV. A sample is taken, a number is assigned to the sample and she’s given a card with the same number to identify herself when she returns a week later for her results. During that week, she’s worried and replays scenes in her mind rethinking what she could have and should have done. She thinks about all her partners and reevaluates them, perhaps coming to terms with the fact that one of these young men could have infected her with HIV. A week later, she walks herself back into the clinic, her heart is racing and her head is pounding. It’s her turn-she’s HIV-positive. She’s seventeen, preparing to go on her prom and now, preparing to die. Instead of asking herself these questions  before  she had sex, she is now asking herself one of the most perplexing and redundant questions of all-“Why me?”  The point is: you and you alone are responsible for your emotional and physical health. Asking yourself any one of these questions before having sex will prompt you to weigh the pros and cons of the outcome of unprotected, protected, and casual sex. Thinking ahead is the best preventative measure-period. And asking yourself these questions is far more responsible than having condoms and birth-control handy. The sex may last just five minutes, but the outcomes can last a lifetime.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   The Truth about Sex*  HIV/AIDS  Forty million people are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS.

       &nbsp;         My journey actually only began a few weeks ago...I just decided once and for all that I was sick and tired of working my self ragged to help someone else accomplish his dreams...So, I told basically everyone I knew how I felt and started writing (I had stopped writing a long time ago...as an English major in college, I kinda got sick of it, and after I graduated I fell off). So, I started emailing local newspapers, websites, etc for volunteer opportunities. Unfortunately, my day job provided me with none of the marketable experience I'd need as a writer.  &nbsp;  Fast forward...went to Mom's house one day and she had a paper lying on the table; she told me to email one of the editors-I did, got an assignment and the rest is history...  &nbsp;  I met an amazing lady named Cassendre Xavier (  urlLink  CassEndreXavier.com    ) and we had such a great conversation (I was actually interviewing her for an article)--I was so inspired!  &nbsp;  One amazing occurrence was the fact that I had actually had this person pegged before I met her...Let me explain, I did some research and sketched some notes about what I wanted to bring into the article based on what I read-she was excited and impressed, but I was mostly proud of the fact that my intuition and insight provided me with everything I needed to know.  &nbsp;  So far, I've written two articles for the paper and I just submitted them today. I hope they like them. My style is somewhat sophisticated in that I actually think of writing as a science and an art. I'm just very uncomfortable with breaking the rules in writing because I respect the art so much. I can't bring myself to use a lot of slang or even loosen up on the typical essay format. Any schmuck can write, right? I like to exemplify my knowledge of writing and literature through what I write...Anyway, as soon as I hear from them, I'll post...I'll also post my article links when they're published...  &nbsp;  I have a workshop in the making too (I was actually supposed to call someone back today--no on second thought-I'm calling her right now-she's not there of course, I left a message-there!). I really want to help young people get off their asses and do something with themselves...so far, everyone I've spoken with about the workshop idea loves it! I just need to get the wheels in motion...I think I am also going to be the next host for a poetry reading and open-mic session in downtown Philly soon-I'll have to think about it though (I need to get all my stuff together before I can actually help someone else). In addition, I am going to entering all sorts of contest for writers and hopefully I'll win, or at least get an honorable mention...  &nbsp;  I just feel like I've started a little late...Even though I'm 23, I’ve had so many ops to get going but always put my dreams on the back burner-well, no more of that. Now I have a full-time job, an apartment to look after and&nbsp;a relationship just filled with all sorts of drama...I'm actually a very interesting person-you'll see...some of the shit that happens to me is just unreal...  &nbsp;  So, that was my intro and by the way, I'm   Sherella  ...Welcome to my world and thanx for listening.  &nbsp;  Peace &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

         Ah! Credit card debt ….I think this is an infamous demon for all of us in our twenties, struggling to pay bills, have fun and keep up with the Joneses. Unfortunately, credit card debt, when combined with student loan debt, rent, food, utilities, transportation expenses, and every other bill we incur to live and breathe, can be frustrating, discouraging and down-right detrimental to our well-being. I know I am not the only one who can attest to getting paid and going broke all in the same day. Of late, payday isn’t even payday anymore—its bill day. It’s the day when I get a moment to see what I could have had, then look at my bills and debt, pay my bills, and sink into depression. That’s me, every payday, in a nutshell.  I think I’ve probably calculated, adjusted, reconsidered, evaluated and redone my budget more than ten times this year. One constant always remains the same, however-my pay. My bills on the other hand, fluctuate without mercy. Fortunately, I was able to devise some manageable solutions over a period of time.  First, I enrolled in budget plans for my utility bills, which are working out nicely. Most budget plans work the same way. An average of the monthly bill is calculated. Once enrolled, the bill you’re issued will look the same and state the amount of the expenses incurred for that month (allowing you to keep track of your balance), but you are only responsible for the prorated amount. One caveat: even if the amount of the bill issued is lower than the prorated amount, you must pay the prorated amount anyway. The plan usually spans for one year, and on the twelfth month, you have to settle your remaining balance. But, if the customer plays her cards right, there may be a positive balance at the end of the plan. Personally, these budget plans have been a godsend for me, because, at the very least, I know I am only responsible for the prorated amount. By keeping track of my balance, I know exactly where I stand and how much I’ll need to settle (if I’ll need to settle) at the end of the twelve-month period. If your account is in good-standing with your utility companies, give them a call and see what they can do for you.  I also dropped the rate plan on my cell phone (some companies extend the contract for one or two years, so be sure to ask). I thought to myself, do I really need 1000 minutes a month? I was only using about half anyway so it just made sense.  Nevertheless, I found that no matter how much I maneuvered each bill, my credit card bills were simply a pain in the ass. Unfortunately, the first step to getting credit card debt under control is to stop using them! I know, easier said than done, but I don’t make the rules. Secondly, you’ll need to consider how much you can genuinely afford to pay (above the minimum) each month. Lastly, GET REAL! Yes, we’d all like to pay everything off in a year, maybe even two, but if your earnings don’t support that goal, what can you do?  Please bear in mind that this advice is only for those of us who haven’t followed the credit card rules and regulations: 1. Only charge what you can afford to pay off each month  (Ha! If I had the money, I would pay with cash, right?)  2. To maintain a favorable credit-rating, never allow your charges to exceed more than half of the available credit  (What’s the fun in that? I’m using the credit cards because I can’t afford the stuff I’m buying…duh!)  3. Do not apply for more credit than you really need  (What!? There’s an old saying, “You can never be too rich, or too…)  Of course, I’m being slightly sarcastic, but this is how I felt about the rules until I realized the debt wasn’t going anywhere. Like most things in life, these rules make sense-in RETROSPECT!  I found some nifty calculators online at MyFico.com, and even though they didn’t decrease my current debt, I was at least able to put it into perspective. Now I can pay my bills each month with the knowledge that I will (one day) reach my goal.  If you are concerned, bothered or even conscious of the fact that your credit card is spinning out of control check out the Debt and Credit Cards calculators at  urlLink MyFico.com   *Update 8.16.04: Please read the comment posted by Axinar who offers some sound advice and picks up where I left off...Most importantly, no matter how overwhelming your credit card debt is, you must always, always, always pay on time and never miss a payment. Thanx Axinar!

       I haven't really found my niche, but from time to time, I dabble in poetry...   At the height of one of my "I can't believe my life sucks this bad" episodes, I created this poem.   Please read it and enjoy!    Oblivion   Their laughter and happiness taunts me,I envy their carefree demeanor. Sometimes I long to live in their thoughtless world, No worries, no insecurities--only jubilance. They live in these tiny universes, They have no desire to escape, For they know reality is esoteric. What do they know about life? Will they ever learn?  Come into my world, I've been to yours. I do not desire ignorance--only enlightenment, For I know the smallest discrepancy can shatter your world. Step into my realm, I've visited yours. But I do not wish to be blind--I see all that is to be seen, For I know your eyes are veiled, you cannot see truth. Visit my universe, I've lived in yours. But I do not want to be deaf--I hear every sound, For I know your hearing is fine-tuned to the benevolence of the world.  I invite you to free yourself, But caution is advised, For once you enter reality, You can never go back to your frivolous existence.  ©1999 Sherella Gibbs

Dec 6th 2004  Alexia Clarke,  TBA Dec 20th 2004 TBA Jan 3rd 2005  Elliot bat Tzedek,  TBA    The Women’s Writing and Spoken Word Series is a nurturing environment that celebrates women in the craft of multi-genre writing. Men can, and often do, attend to listen, and also to share their work.  Personally, the readings are my therapy…I laugh, ponder on the intricacies of life and am enlightened each time I go. One of my favorite aspects about the readings is the fact that they are not just about poetry, but about the written and spoken word. Our features and open mic performers read whatever turns them on, be it a poem, a passage from her book, an essay, a song, an article-anything! Now, I could write a book about all the spectacular comings-and-goings at Robin’s but, I’d rather you come see for yourself. If you’re ever in the neighborhood-stop by!
