Ate Camille Ann : sige na!  Jana : FINE!  Kuya King :  *Happy Birthday to you 2x Happy Birthday 2x Happy Birthday to you* *Sana ay magbago ang damdamin mo, at dinggin mo ang pakiusap ko.

Camille : Yup..Ü Here's ate Camille..  Ate Camille Ann:  O, sige na.. Happy Birthday uli!  My relatives visited and of course, my cousins too! For hours, we were in the pool..Ü Hehe..Ü Suddenly, our maid was shouting 'Jana, Jana!' and running towards us.  Ate Nina  called, but I wasn't able to answer it. Hehe. Well, its okay..Ü   Shangri-La..Ü   We were supposed to go at Galleria, but! Change of plans, we decided just to meet up at Shangri-La. When I arrived there,  Ate Arianne  was my only companion. We were just walking and walking and walking and decided to hang out at Starbucks. Finally!  Camille  and  Ate Camille Ann  (or should i call them the CamilleSst..Ü?!) arrived. After having dinner, we chilled out at  Streetscape  and  Ate Camille Ann  received a text from  Mamalet  saying: Wala pa c King?! So, all of us were puzzled.  Ate Ariannne  called  Mamalet  to know why she's asking..   After the phone call..   Ate Arianne : Di sila pupunta.... ..Joke Time!  Haha. All of us screamed and laughed.  Ate Geneve  and  Angel  arrived too..Ü Suddenly,  Gary V .. ( Kuya King's car ) were visible to our eyes.. They're here!  Mamalet  called  Ate Arianne  and  Ate Camille Ann . And just for a short while, they called me too.. I was asking why then,  Kuya King  handed me a bouquet of flowers and ensaymada, my favorite! I couldn't stop laughing that time! But,  Kuya King  didn't know that i like ensaymada.. Wahahahaha! Anyways, after that  Kuya King  invited us to eat at  CPK .. There, we had a lot of laughs. As in! Hehe.. It striked midnight and  Camille  called up  Ate Peachy . Its her birthday naman! Not mine anymore. Well, happy birthday  Ate Peach !!  After we ate at CPK, its time to go home..  Kuya King  went down the escalator that's heading up.. Weird! When we were infront of Starbucks, i saw  Mingky !! I was so surprised! Anyways, my mom and  Kuya Jon  were office mates before pala. Hehe, didn't know that. Well, thats what happened on my birthday! Ü

       Camille  and I shopped at  Powerplant  before picking up  Ate Peachy . When we were at Ate Peachy's house, we were both scared to get inside because of their dog. Haha. Weird! Anyways, we went to  wave  also before going to  Dish . When we were at  Dish , we were just sitting and waiting for the others to arrive. First to arrive was  Ate Camille Ann  along with her friends. Then next,  Mimim  and  Kaye .Ü    Kuya King  was the one who performed on the 1st set. He called for us again to sing. So, we sang  This Love  by  Maroon 5 . I was holding the mic while  Mimim  was singing and I gave it to Kaye. Haha. Sorry,  Buzz Mims !Ü Hope to do that again next time!!   Next set, The  Soul Siren !Ü She was sick nga that time. Sobrang nakakaawa!   Uhh.. Dunno what to say na. Haha. Basta I had a great time especially seeing  Buzz Mims  and  Buzz Kaye  again. Missed you guys!Ü

      Well.. It was just an ordinary school day. My friends  Mingky ,  Carmina ,  Hannah ,  Janine ,  Krista ,  Bianca ,  Ina ,  Issa ,  'Mommy' Claire ,  Michelle  and  Maureen  were out on their field trip. So, it was so boring and  INCOMPLETE . While, waiting for my ride home, i was with my friend. My friend and I were just walking and talking. While walking, someone approached my friend. &nbsp;  SomeOne ..: artista ba siya?! (pointing at me)  My frieNd ..: di ah! future artista! kaboses nga niya si Camille Velasco, eh!  Jana : Huh?! Anong pinagsasabi mo?!  My frieNd ..: totoo naman, ah! &nbsp; Haha. Whatever. Anyways, this day was the suuperrest booring day of my life. Kaya when I reached home, i checked my phone if there were any text messages from them, but none! All i received was a text from  Kuya King . Saying that he'd be happy to be part of our school's charity work. Anyways,&nbsp;I texted all of&nbsp;my friends &nbsp;asking how was their field trip.  Maureen ,  Krista  and  Carmina  were the only ones who replied. Grr!!  &nbsp; This day is so  IncOmpLete ..
