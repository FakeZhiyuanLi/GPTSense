      im listening to modest mouse...i like that song... float on . well another worthless day at school. well its a matter of days now before chrissie invites me to her pool... yep i feel it coming...she's gonna invite me lol. its funny sometimes i think she doesnt really like me lol...(i know she's reading this lol) (BTW...i love toga parties.) ok so whats new in the exhilerating life of wsam...hmm...ok LOTR is out today!!! Lord of the Rings: return of the king on DVD !!!! YES!!! i think im gonna go buy it...maybe 2morrow. im so excited. well my debt card ceased to work now... so i had to go to the bank and get a new card. and i just realized i dont like providant bank b/c theres only like 1 per every 50 miles. so i headed over to bank of america concidering they have one on every corner. but cant go there!!! im under 18 and they dont offer checking to us under 18ers...but provident does... so im gonna stay there. anywho... i havnt been to the gym in over a week. which isnt good but ive been uh...busy lately...lol. im just wasting $30 a month really cause i go maybe once a week. i used to go a lot like 4 times a week...ya know for these mui thai (kickboxing) classes, that lasted for like 2 months. o well im healthy, i dont eat junk food....ok a little, but im fine, i actually lose weight, its weird. im thinking of getting a new screen name. i dunno what yet. but then again my sn is cool enough. i like it. i was at the light today at crommwell and loch raven blvd and there was at least 8 billion cicadas attacking my car. its the most ive ever seen i had to close my windows so they dont digest me. (and BTW its 90 degrees and i have no A/C) but it doesnt matter, rather be hot than eaten . that intersection has a lot of cigaydas. there kinda neat though. i mean it is once every 17 years. learn to appreciate it. i gotta stay after school tomorrow grr... for this internshi meeting with ms falcone and my parents for next yr. i am sooo excited about next yr...whoo...hooo...(note the sarcasm). well im off. im gonna go eat....healthy eat!!! or so i say...ok leave pretty comments... stay tuned for more  "From the depths of Wsam's archives "... !!!

HAHA OH YEA!!! so the cop comes...yea only one...i thought it was gonna be like a raid or something with like 10 cars with 4 guys in each one...but no...just one. so we talk to him and describe all what happend..AND I GIVE HIM THE TAG # !!!!... and he said that one night they're gonna wait inside with the whole night crew and wait til those basterds break in so they can be like...."FREEZE!!! BCPD BITCH PUT UR HANDS UP FOOLS!!!!" so ne ways me and justin and bridgette did a good job we didnt sissy out and run, we chased em...and they ran. but they'll be back...and when they do...heh heh...i'll be watching!!!

      welcome....um..its season 2....  im listening to 3 doors down...i love it...hm...its saturday night...all my friends are pretty much gone for a long time...i guess it wouldn't matter much if they were here anyways...but i've decided not to do that voice thing its kinda gay...well i've hit over 1000 visitors which is a good sign i guess. i really dont have much to say i guess thats why i havnt been updating as much...i dunno if you've heard of our gang...the woody wangstas...yes im in a gang...my gang name is EGYphLIE...i'll tell u the rest of their names...here....Megan: Squish-E, Shawn: $upa Lyk a NIP, colleen: McSHO-TAY, Ashley: toXic, amanda: A-cup, Kelly: Jolly G2(squared), allie: D-BELY, Justin: WANG, Mary: Bang Bang, Jess: Boitana, Katelyn: Gimp-E, Demian: Lytes Out, casey: Band Kamp, jen: 1/2 $taf, amy: MoNoTiZeR, Lauren: Chappy, Bridget: DIVE-ON69?? well thats all of em...and we have gang shirts and gang signs all.... so whats new...um...my new job is doin good i guess. cept the fact that i sit right under the AC vent so i freeze all the time, i have to bring like sweaters and stuff. i went and test drove the car im hopefully gonna buy soon. its real nice, handles corners real well and feels like a 6-cylinder, picks up speed pretty quick. but im sure u dont care...so um...i guess thats it really. i truly do hate my life...im not happy and i dont know why...

      well so remember the scion i was tellin u bout...well my dad decided he wouldnt let me get it n e more cause he wanted me to have 4WD...he took me to carmax just to 'browse' and b4 u know it he  was all into it and we saw my baby!! Jungle green....2004 3.3L SE-V6 XTERRA!!  big engine but its drinks gas like crazy...for those who havnt seen it u'll see it someday eventually. its bout time i got MY own car...cause for the past yr ive been driving my moms car....which isnt bad or anything it was fine with me but we were starting to have transportation problems...u know parents busy and me busy so my dad said its time. for the ast yr i kept askin him to buy anything....'ME:please dad this ones only $4000!!!....DAD: no....' so i guess patience does bring good things....for everyone out there wanting a nice ride....DO WHAT I DID!!! SAVE UR MONEY, every penny counts, no joke!!!! BELIEVE IT!! dont spend ur money on useless things...4real just put ur paychecks directly in the bank..and sure treat urself a   LITTLE   bit, but not much and b4 u know it,  u'll be pimpin...it took me damn over a year but the days have come...well im out....take my word for it, u'll c....
