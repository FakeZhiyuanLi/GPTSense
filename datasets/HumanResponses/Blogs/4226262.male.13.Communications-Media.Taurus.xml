      Hey... So what's up? I'm ready for this band thing so lets get serious... We still haven't had a jam... WE NEED TO HAVE ONE! I'm ready for this and I wanna do it! I wanna be the next Atreyu... I wanna be the next grammy winner... I wanna do this and I'm soooo ready! So to contribute to the band I have written handfuls of songs.... Taylor is letting us use HIS DADS recording studio, so Hayden and Bryan... You need to get your butts into this band thing and learn some chords... We have 4 years to pull together this band thing so we can start performing! 4 YEARS! THAT'S NOT FRIKEN LONG! We can make a CD right now for the fun of it... But seriously we've got 4 years to start performing... Another 4 to get discovered and maybe if we're lucky 4 more to be famous... Then we're dead... Everyone forgets about us and we have no career... Now we may stay famous for 30 years if we're the next AC/DC but I seriously doubt that... I mean it's highly unlikely we're gonna be the next AC/DC... Now if we don't get a jam together before 2005 I quit the band and start a new one and you guys are stuck cuz you dont know a thing about getting a band together.... Sorry but thats the way it goes... Im contributing my life to music and Im not gonna be held back by a bunch of screw ups... Im gonna get famous for my music and if This Side Up wants to join the fun then you can go ahead but other wise you guys are screwed... Well Im sorry if I got pissed and went off but thats the way it's gonna be...
