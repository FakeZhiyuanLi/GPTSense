      I had the bonfire party that I've been planning for about a month.(I kept having to postpone it).  Three of my friends, who are on my message board, my sister, and her friend, came. We ate junk food and played sardines (which is the reverse of hide-and-go-seek; one person hides and everyone else looks and then hides with the 'it' person.  the last person to find the hiding spot loses and is 'it' next time).

      I've been grounded from the computer, so here's everything I couldn't post. Thursday: Our Boy Scout meeting was in the park.  Since I didn't have anything else to do, I went with the younger scouts as the did an orientering cource for a requriement. When we ran into somebody's house, we knew something had to be wrong. Sure enough, the younger scouts had gotten us lost (it wasn't my fault, because I was just following them). One of the leaders found us a little after that, and lead us back to the pavilion. On the way, he said he was proud of us for all sticking together (we started out as three or so seperate groups, and all got mashed together, most likely by the groups behind trying to cheat off of the groups that were ahead). It rained really hard on the way back. I blame our luck on my walking stick, which I took home with me and intend to take to summer camp for more good luck :). (this blog should have emoticons!) Friday: I went to Kennywood (amusement park) with some of my friends for my school's Kennywood picnic. (more of my ex-school, because I'll be going to a Catholic high school next year). The only semi-interesting thing to say is that we got to see them add a new car to one of the roller coasters.  They moved the track to put it on, which was pretty cool.  A ride broke down when I was there for a school field trip (on June 1). In the long line (probably the longest in the park), I said to the friends I was with "It'll probably break down when we get to the end of the line", and sure enough, we had to wait an extra twenty minnutes for them to fix before we could get on (they actualy strapped us into our car, and then it broke). Saturday: My grandparents came over for Father's Day, because my dad wanted to see a concert downtown on the actual day (see below). Knowing grandparents, they just sat around and talked. We did, however, have tasty pie after dinner. (Now, I wish that there was a "yum" emoticon, or at least a happy emoticon) Sunday: We went downdown to see a free, outdoors Richard Thompson concert, some singer my dad likes.  I just sat around and played my gameboy.  At least I got to have a sausage sandwitch for dinner. Monday: I updated my blog.  This is what I put in it. "I've been grounded from the computer, so..." just kidding :)

      I just got back from summer camp with my boy scout troop(actualy it was a week ago, but I've been lazy with my blog, so I changed the date to make it look that way).  I took two merit badges; canoeing and space exploration.  In canoeing, we mostly flipped our canoes over and over, and practiced different ways of getting water out of them.  We also learned different strokes, and the parts of the paddle (not oar, as our counsoler reminded us) and canoe.  In space exploration, we took some notes on space stuff (yawn), designed a space ship and space station, and built and launched model rockets. I've gotten the same rocket, the Gnome, from cub scout camp a while ago, but I lost it launching it at home.  A part of my rocket wasn't glued on good enough, so the nose cone was lost.  Guess I won't have another Gnome after all. :( On Sunday night, we had a campwide campfire, where the staff did a bunch of silly skits.  Wendsday night was parent's night.  First, we ate dinner up at the camp, which is probably the best meal all week, especialy compared to the camp food (bleah!).  There was an anything that floats race, where troops build and raced homemade boats.  Our troop entered two different boats, both made with barrels.  One of the boats broke apart and nearly sunk, but the other boat (the 'Asian Invasion' as the boys who build it named it) won second place.  Then, we had colors (when you lower the flag at the end of the day) and Order of the Arrow tapouts.  The OA is a group of scouts, both boys and adults, who have been selected by their peers (they vote).  After they get tapped out and complete an ordeal, they perform service projects, such as building stuff, for the camp.  I was tapped out, and my ordeal will most likely be at the end of August. Some of the older boys brought up a water-baloon slingshot and a bag of water baloons, which they'd been launching a little bit all week.  Another troop had a slingshot, and we had a waterbaloon war on Firday night. Our launcher broke during the second round of attacks, but we still had a blast!  After the war, we went to another campwide campfire, where troops got awards for the stuff they did during the week. Our troop got a beach ball signed by all the staff for winning a vollyball competition, and a watermellon for 2nd place in anything that floats.  Then, they showed a slide show of pictures from the week. I came home today (well, read the first sentence. I'm pretending its the July 3rd).
