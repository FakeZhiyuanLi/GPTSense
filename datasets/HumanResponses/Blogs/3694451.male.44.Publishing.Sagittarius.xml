      Reason with yourself to 12 and change your mind concerning Suicide  1. Is it necessary for me to kill myself? 2. Is suicide the best option? 3. Are there no other better options 4. Is life not the most valuable possession that I have? 5. They say, “When there is life, there is hope”. Is it not true in my own case too? 6.  Is this really the end of the road for me or just a bend at a corner? 7. Am I the only one having this problem? Does anyone else have this problem? Had anyone had this problem which I am now facing and then had overcome it and lived longer? 8. Is it the wisest and best decision to kill myself or is it foolish? 9. What if hell is real and heaven is certain? Would I be allowed into heaven through a suicidal grave? 10. Does suicide actually solve the problem? Or am I going to face hell and an angry Maker and fellowship with demons in hell? 11. Is it not better to face public opinions now and overcome them because if I kill myself they would still talk more and worse about me? 12. Will someone not miss me? Will a loved one not miss my absence?  Will I not create problems, sorrow and heartaches for others left behind? Would that be kind of me?

      9. The Almighty Yahweh, our Father in heaven forbids it. He forbids murder.  Suicide is self-murder. He wants you to live the full tales of your life.   10. It is a temptation from Satan.  Don’t yield to it.  11.If you kill yourself where will you spend the rest of your life in eternity after death because there is life after death.   12. I need you badly.  You can write me if you need encouragement to go on to the next big, gigantic success and prosperity waiting for you in the nearest future. Who know? It may be tomorrow. You too can be a great encouragement to me now and henceforth. So don't die now because I need you.

                      12 Reasons You Must Not Commit Suicide - Part 3                                    Reasons 7 & 8  7 You are of great value.  You are unique. There is no one like you.  There are still things you can do that no other person on earth can do except you and you alone. The sweetest, the best, the most glorious part of you is yet to be revealed. You can still succeed in life.  You can still be prosperous in life. You can still be victorious over that battle. You are useful.  Who said you are useless?  Don’t believe them and don’t believe your own lies and deceitful thoughts that you are totally useless.  No.  You are not.  8. It is NEVER TOO LATE to make it in life. What matters most is your life. If there is life there is hop.  Time is not too late for me and for you.  You can do more in the remaining part of your life than you have ever done in the past years of your life.  Our Saviour and Redeemer had to spend 30 years in TOTAL SILENCE and 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness experience and the devil told him to jump down and commit suicide. He refused it.  And for just three and half years that were left for him to live He did more and greater things than the past 30 years. Three and half years are just about one-tenth of his life span on earth.  If you had spend 45 years and you have 5 mores years to spend, you can achieve more things and greater things within those five years more than the 45 years all combined.  So cheer up. Smile, live and get going.

                      Don't Commit Suicide, Please! Part 2                            Reasons 5 - 6  5.   Our life is like a sine curve. Sometimes we are up on the mountain top, sometimes we are in the valley of sorrow, disappointment and grief and sometimes we are levelled with the ground.  But no condition is permanent. The circumstances of our life keeping changing.  The changes are from good to bad back to good again; from pleasant to painful back to pleasant again.  Are you down now? You will rise again.  Are you in pains now? Pleasant surprises are waiting for you soon. Wait! Don't commit suicide.   6.  You are unique.  You are the only one of your kind. There are some tasks and achievement that it is only you who can do it, no other person is gifted to do it.  There may be a new discovery that would benefit the whole world that it is only you who would make that discovery.  There may be a new technology, a new solution to age-long problems of man that it is only you who would give the solution.  Don't end it up now.  Your life can blossom again. Yes. I am sure of that.
