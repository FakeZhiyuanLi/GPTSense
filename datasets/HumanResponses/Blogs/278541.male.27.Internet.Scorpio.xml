						   Aristotle said in the first sentence of his Metaphysics, 'All men by nature desire to know.' This is the secret magic and danger of having a mind. Even though your body is always bound to one place, your mind is a relentless voyager. The mind has a magnificent, creative restlessness that always brings it on a new journey. Even in the most sensible and controlled lives there is often an undertow of longing that would deliver them to distant shores. There is something within you that is not content to remain fixed within any one frame. You cannot immunize yourself against your longing. You love to reach beyond, to discover something new. Knowing calls you out of yourself. Discovery delights the heart. This is the natural joy of childhood and the earned joy of the artist. The child and the artist are pilgrims of discovery. When you limit your life to the one frame of thinking, you close out the mystery.  Further Reading:  urlLink Eternal Echoes: Exploring Our Yearning to Belong - John O'Donohue

						   From brendonwilson.com  urlLink Jerry Kaplan's Top Five    Top 5 Critical Attitudes Entrepreneurs Need      * The belief that they can make a difference: To overcome the odds against success, an entrepreneur needs to passionately believe in the idea that one person can make a different. And that they are that person.     * Passion for making things happen: The people that make good entrepreneurs can't help but make things happen. Lots of people have ideas, but if you don't try, you'll never succeed.     * Unjustifiable optimism: If you're going to be turned down by 30 venture capitalists, you're going to need something to keep you going. Great anecdote: FedEx, early in its development, couldn't make its payroll and it looked like the company was going to fold - so the head of the company took the remaining money to Las Vegas, bet it all, and won. You have to believe you're going to succeed.     * High tolerance for uncertainty: You're not always going to have all the information you need, when you need it. If you wait for all the information, it'll probably be too late to do anything useful. Deal with it.     * Urgent patience: This is a balancing act between trying to get things done, and realizing that things take time.     * Genuine concern for other people: The only way you'll succeed is if you actually care about the people you work with - it breeds loyalty, and that breeds success. People love to work for people they know care about them.  Top 5 Critical Skills Entrepreneurs Need      * Leadership: Leadership is a difficult thing to define. When things are going well, you don't need leadership. But when things are going badly, the ability to get people to come together, make compromises, and move forward is what makes the difference between success and failure. That's leadership.     * Communication skills: Most people won't remember what you said five minutes after you said it. You have to keep it simple. Which leads to the next point...     * The ability to make sure people know their jobs: Communication is critical to making sure everyone knows where they fit in the company, what will happen if they aren't successful in doing their job.     * Know when to make a decision: Amateurs make decisions too early, before they have corrected all of the pertinent information. Perfectionists wait until everything is certain. An entrepreneur needs to learn to live in between those extremes.     * Teamwork: Key to utilizing the people you hired (presumably the right people, right?) is having the sense to delegate tasks, accept their input, and let them get the job done. You can't do it all yourself.     * The ability to "telescope": An entrepreneurs needs to be able to "zoom in" to examine the detail in various areas, while maintaining the ability to "zoom out" and take in the big picture.     * The ability to be direct, but polite: At some point, you're going to have to be able to be polite, but direct. Example: at some point you're going to have to figure out how to say "Bob, it might be a good idea if you took a shower before you came to work", but nicer.

						    urlLink Naina Redhu  excerpts an article by  urlLink Mary E. Corcoran    When one feels as creative as a blank sheet of paper and every project appears overwhelming or boring, it isn't simple boredom, but an absence of creative thought. You're not productive, and, instead of relishing your downtime, you feel guilty and mildly irritated.

						   From  urlLink Business Week Online :   Companies cannot really see beyond their current customer base. They explicitly or implicitly do things to protect their current customers. And the last person to want real change is your customer. This is why most new ideas come from small companies that have nothing to lose.   On Skype:   As I said above, innovation comes from those who stand to lose the least from it. That said, lets separate what Skype is doing from innovation itself. Skype is remarkable (I know them well) and will change the landscape radically. However, they have done so not by innovating and inventing either peer-to-peer or IP telephony, but by executing extremely well. The actual innovations came long before.    Where do new ideas come from:   Historically, four places: government labs, big corporations, startup companies, and research universities.

						   Comment on  urlLink A VC's  post by  urlLink Alice Marshall .   I think the secret to the success of Google ads is the low price. They are affordable for even the smallest business. Moreover, there are no production expenses involved.   Production expenses of the ad, that is.

						   Canadian history professor David Noble thinks that modern technology may be deluding scientists with an exaggerated sense of their power over nature: "The military development of man-machine systems gave rise to both 'virtual reality' computer simulation systems (described by Jason Lanier, who coined the term, as 'computerized sensory immersion') and 'cyberspace' (the term invented by science-fiction writer William Gibson), the on-line world of computer-mediated communication (via the Internet, originally the Department of the Army ARPANET). Enmeshed in computer-based communication and simulation systems, human beings experienced an 'enhancement of the senses' and the seemingly infinite extension of their mental powers and reach--delusions of omniscience, omnipresence, and omnipotence that fueled fantasies of their own God-likeness.  "'Our fascination with computers is more deeply spiritual than utilitarian,' computer-industry consultant and philosopher Michael Heim has argued, tracing its roots back to the seventeenth- century mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. 'When on-line, we break free from bodily existence,' from our 'earthy, earthly existence,' and emulate the viseo dei, the perspective of God, the "all-at-oneness" of divine knowledge.' 'What better way to emulate God's knowledge,' Helm wrote, 'than to generate a virtual world constituted by bits of information. Over such a cyber world human beings could enjoy a god-like instant access.' Indeed, the designers of one of the earliest civilian computer-communication networks, a community bulletin board created in 1978 for the San Francisco Bay Area, opened their prospectus with the words: 'We are as gods and might as well get good at it.' As one sociologist described them, these pioneers of cyberspace were charged with a 'technospiritual bumptiousness, full of the redemptive power of technology.' 'Much of the work of cyberspace researchers,' she wrote, 'assumes that the human body is "meat"--obsolete, as soon as consciousness itself can be uploaded into the network. The discourse of visionary virtual world builders is rife with images of imaginal bodies, freed from constraints that flesh imposes.' 'The body in cyberspace is immortal,' declared one enthusiast."

						   I do a fair amount of reading on the net and many times come across interesting and insightful stuff. But there was no easy way of recording these bits. Tried with wikis, notepad.yahoo, saving in text files, emailing, bookmarking etc.  Bookmarks are good for organizing links / sites. But if you find only a certain paragraph of an article insightful there is no good way to annotate it. A blog seems the right medium for this kind of recording activity.  Also, this blog is intentionally unfocussed. Its there to collect every interesting / thought provoking that stuff I come across.

						   This text talks about the Greek civilization - I think its more true for the great but neglected Indian civilization.         "The Greeks and, learning from them, the Romans created a noble and complex civilization, which flourished for a thousand years and was overthrown only through a long series of invasions and civil wars, epidemics, economic disasters, and administrative, moral, and religious catastrophes. It did not entirely disappear. Nothing so great and so long established does. Something of it lived, transformed but undestroyed, throughout the agonizing centuries in which mankind slowly built up western civilization once more. But much of it was covered by wave after wave of barbarism; silted over; buried; and forgotten. Europe slipped backwards, backwards, almost into savagery.       "When the civilization of the west began to rise again and remake itself, it did so largely through rediscovering the buried culture of Greece and Rome. Great systems of thought, profound and skilful works of art, do not perish unless their material vehicle is utterly destroyed. They do not become fossils, because a fossil is lifeless and cannot reproduce itself. But they, whenever they find a mind to receive them, live again in it and make it live more fully."

His point is that, just as the IBM PC moved the locus of profit from hardware to software, so the Web is moving the locus of profit from software to services...  A site business model is more important than the software written for it."  Source:  urlLink Moore's Lore: Tim O'Reilly's Clue

						   Eight practices of Effective Executives:   * They asked, "What needs to be done?" * They asked, "What is right for the enterprise?" * They developed action plans. * They took responsibility for decisions. * They took responsibility for communicating. * They were focused on opportunities rather than problems. * They ran productive meetings. * They thought and said "we" rather than "I."    On the need to review decisions, especially people decisions:   It's just as important to review decisions periodically—at a time that's been agreed on in advance—as it is to make them carefully in the first place. That way, a poor decision can be corrected before it does real damage. These reviews can cover anything from the results to the assumptions underlying the decision.  Such a review is especially important for the most crucial and most difficult of all decisions, the ones about hiring or promoting people. Studies of decisions about people show that only one-third of such choices turn out to be truly successful. One-third are likely to be draws—neither successes nor outright failures. And one-third are failures, pure and simple. Effective executives know this and check up (six to nine months later) on the results of their people decisions. If they find that a decision has not had the desired results, they don't conclude that the person has not performed. They conclude, instead, that they themselves made a mistake. In a well-managed enterprise, it is understood that people who fail in a new job, especially after a promotion, may not be the ones to blame.

						   1. Analogize and Distinguish If the outcome of the previous case is favorable to your client, you analogize by emphasizing how this precedent is very similar to your case. But, if the outcome of the previous case would encourage a decision against your client, you distinguish by pointing out how the precedent differs.  2. Don't Hide Bad News "After looking at all the options, I recommend this plan. I know it's more expensive than the other bids, but the quality is better and the contractor is willing to commit to an earlier completion date."  3. Ask Leading Questions "You've been working on Capitol Hill for three years, right?" The non-leading version "How long have you worked for the congressman?"  Source: KnowledgeNews
