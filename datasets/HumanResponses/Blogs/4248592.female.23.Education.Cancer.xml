        The weather is sooo beautiful right now...why can't every night be like tonight?? I went for a walk around the block by myself...Mike had to work late AGAIN :(I could smell popcorn coming from quaker oats...I just love that smell it reminds me of when I was in grade two and my teaher Miss.Pammett used to make us all popcorn every friday...yummmm.... I have one day left at zellers on saturday and then it is my official holidays!!! I can't wait...camping is getting closer and closer! Im a little nervous about trying to fit all this stuff into steves car there is six people going and one vehicle to pack all our stuff into..not to mention the fact we are doing all the shopping the morning of camping...can you say scary situation? cuz I sure as hell can!          Anyways, Im bored and thought Id write a little "blog"...until next time...keep fit and have fun

       I hate zellers  ...  translation...I hate zellers...it seems there is just not enough time until my holidays...customers drive me nuts...by the way check out  urlLink www.customerssuck.com  it's awesome.            My washing machine exploded tonight, I put some laundry in and then went to my room to try to hang up some new blinds I had just bought I heard Mike yelling, "SARAH!". I ran into the laundry room and the hose that transfers the water into the washer had split and water was everywhere! It was spraying all over Mike and I and all over the walls and the floor. So, I ran over and turned off the water connections. Thank God the dryer wasnt on because the plug was soaked...Mike and I would have been fried!!!      I have to go for x-rays on friday because I have a big lump on my lower spine, its creeping me out but the doctor just thinks I have an inflammed muscle.           Anyways, I am counting down to camping only 7 days left!!! Time to hit the sack...Later!

      I have work in exactly 2.5 hours...man I hate zellers...wait hate is the wrong word...loath...there! much better. I am looking forward to camping and my holidays starting this sunday. It is going to be incredible. Mike, me, my sister, her boyfriend steve, cathy and matt are going up. I am very interested to see how things turn out for cathy and matt sleeping in the same tent and not knowing each other...should be a real ride...of course I would love for them to fall in love and get married and cathy to be happy...Im hoping matt doesnt stink lol  Mike bought me an awesome Evanescence poster! I love it!! Its right above my bed. I want to go back to the day of the concert it was one of the best days of my life minus the 3 hours of walking, the scary drunk guy dancing by us, cathy not feeling well and steves psycho driving skills.  Anyways, Ill be writing again Im sure...til then keep on truckin'...honk honk...
