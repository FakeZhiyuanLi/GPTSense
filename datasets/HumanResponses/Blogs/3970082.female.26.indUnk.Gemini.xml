      God Bless Reverend Al Sharpton. I have been avoiding the Democratic National Convention. I did not want to hear yet another sanitized speech which gave no opinions about the way this country has been run since the 2000 election. I did not want to hear once again, that the Democrats were not going to attack Bush, or take a stand on any of the numerous issues they could be talking about. Instead, the Democrats have been looking like ostriches with their heads in the sand, looking for their butts. This morning, I heard about Al Sharpton, and the fact that he did not give the cookie-cutter speech approved for by the DNC, and instead spoke from the heart. He spoke the words of a lot of Americans, words I have been hoping to hear since the primaries. Here is a quote from the speech last night. I had hoped to copy the entire speech, but discovered that because he did not give the speech the DNC had approved, no news agency so far has a copy of the speech. This is the passage that touched me the most (Quoted from  urlLink www.signonsandiego.com ):  "Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age," Sharpton said. "Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of (civil rights activists) Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner, soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us. This vote can't be bargained away. This vote can't be given away.  "In all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale."   Mr. Sharpton has earned my respect, and my admiration. I did not expect much out of this election process, except to hopefully oust President Bush. A lot of you may have heard me declare that I plan on moving to Canada and pleading for political asylum on Wednesday November 3rd 2004 if we re-elect President Bush. Mr. Sharpton has reinvigorated my desire to work toward getting John Kerry elected. He may not have the ability to declare his opinions as bluntly as Reverend Sharpton can, but he can be the face that helps to make those opinions fact.   I'm gonna end this entry with one more quote from the honorable Reverend Sharpton: "The issue of government is not to determine who may sleep together in the bedroom, it's to help those that might not be eating in the kitchen."   I now wish I had spent last night listening to his entire speech. It definetely gives me hope for the future.

      For the past few days I have been thinking of my friend N/A. Yes, I called him N/A for various reasons including the fact that he liked to be known as "not-applicable." He was a tall, thin man who liked to walk, liked to drink and liked to cause mischief. Ok mischief is not the&nbsp;right word, he liked to get in trouble...liked to push boundries...and liked to do&nbsp;most of it while intoxicated.   I remember he only had one pair of shoes, a pair of brown leather mocassins that he wore without socks. He&nbsp;walked in those shoes&nbsp;across the city of Washington DC, rather than spend the $2.20 to take the&nbsp;metro. He wore holes in the soles of the shoes, yet refused to&nbsp;buy new ones until the snow got so bad he had to, or&nbsp;risk frostbite.   I remember one night in the dorm, he came over to hang&nbsp;out with me,&nbsp;some other friends.&nbsp;He had a bottle of Banana flavored liquor. It tasted like a combination banana and cough syrup. It was some of the most foul stuff I have ever consumed in my life...but we drank it. We were young, stupid, and a tad self-destructive.   We wandered down to the music room, and played chopsticks on the piano. He leaned forward, &nbsp;looking like he was going to kiss me. I was sitting on the floor, and he was sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair with an attached&nbsp;desk-arm. He nearly decapitated me. That is a memory I will never forget...nearly losing my life in the music room...by a chair decapitation.   I hope whereever he is now, and whatever he is doing, he is&nbsp;living truthfully.  &nbsp;

      I own an umbrella that I have chased around the country. I have left it in truckstops, and restaurants, and have back-tracked 100 miles to retrieve it. It may seem silly, tracking down an umbrella, but this umbrella represents for me, one of the darkest times in my life.   I was 20, almost 21, and home from college because I was sick. No one was completely sure what was wrong with me, except that I was dizzy, fainting, and had massive headaches. I was scared. I felt completely alone and isolated from everyone around me. Part of it was my own fault, dealing with people made me miss the life I had been leading as a care-free college student. The other part of it was the "fault" of the people who were around me. They had no clue how to deal with someone who was sick, and not elderly. I was also incredibly afraid of people.  Still, I digress, this posting is about the umbrella. During this time, an exhibit on Monet came to the Allbright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. It was only pictures he had done at Givenchy, and I really wanted to go. My parents, and their friends got us tickets. We went to the exhibit, and about halfway through it, I nearly passed out.   I remember my father sitting with me in a chair, and that I never finished viewing the exhibit. Monet is one of my favorite artists, and I felt really horrible, since I had wanted to view the entire showing. I wanted to cry.   My parents bought me an umbrella, with Monet's water lilies on it. I got better, and have gone on with my life. Still, I keep this umbrella, to remind me of a time when I was so weak, I needed my father to help carry me.

      I am sitting in Starbucks, reading a magazine article about the gentrification of New Brunswick NJ written four years ago, because there is also an article about the 2000 Democratic convention in it, and wondering why? There was a time when I would have scoffed at sitting in a Starbucks, and would have chosen a non-chain alternative. I have one, 2 blocks away. I could have gone there, but I chose to stop here.   Since moving to South Florida, I feel like my level of consumption has risen. Maybe it’s the fact that I am living with my parents, and being around them for long periods of time these days makes me sick. I find myself driving, thought I know it is bad for the environment. I look for jobs in the next county, or the county above that, just because I know I would not be able to live with them and work, if I got those positions. Every time I fill up my gas tank, I know I am being cruel to the environment, but I can’t help myself. Its like I am saving my sanity by polluting the planet.   I eat out more than I did up north and I usually consume fast food. Burger King and Wendy’s may no longer use cardboard boxes to wrap their food, but they still use so much stuff, I feel like I have killed a couple trees in the past 4 months.   When did I become this person, who does not take into account my level of consumption as I lead my life? When did the term “need” start working with a pair of ruby red high heels that are so insanely high I could never wear them? Last night, I said that, even though they were probably the most frivolous item I could buy. Wait, no, considering the store I was in, the pair of shoes is not the most frivolous thing I could have purchased.&nbsp; Still, realizing that I used the word, “need,” when it came to shoes, alarms me a lot.   Just now, I witnessed a scene where a toddler was being entertained by his big sister. She was pushing him back and forth with her feet, in his stroller. Their father did not like the fact that the toddler was laughing really loud. I was smiling at the children, and when the father interceded and told them to calm down, I gave him a look. He took it to mean I did not want the children to be loud; when in fact, it was just the opposite. I wanted them to be louder. I wanted them to scream and run around this Starbucks, and threaten to tear the place apart. And yet to that father, I looked like a person who did not like rambunctious kids.   I’ve become a ma’am. In restaurants and at work, especially when I am wandering around the office in a business suit, advising people twice my age on financial planning and their taxes, I get called ma’am. I’m too young to be ma’am. Ma’am is a term for my mother. It is a term for older women with greying hair. Wait, I have at least five grey hairs at the moment. So that definition does not work for me. Women who are called ma’am worry about mutual funds and the stock market. Ok, that doesn’t work either, since I do keep track of my measly portfolio and wish I could put money away for the future. I guess I don’t have any more arguments against being ma’am. I have reached that age.   It makes me amused to realize that a lot of the declarations about myself I made at 16, I have reversed by the time I was 26. I told myself at 16, no matter my interest in the Middle East, I would never work for an oil company. Now I wonder if Halliburton is hiring, though I don’t bother going to their website to seriously pursue it. I did look at BP and Exxon-Mobil. Just looking at the websites made me sick to my stomach. I felt sick, mainly because I realized, I could work for those companies. I could sell my soul to a corporation and be relatively happy. The thing that stops me is the move to Texas or Oklahoma and the fifty-mile a day commute out to the suburbs I see in my future. Oh, and don’t forget the SUV and the 2.5 kids. I have to make sure they are in the picture.&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I have had four hours sleep, and should be doing something more productive than writing yet another blog message, but the message I had written, and was going to post...an analysis of my consumptionist ways, is on a floppy disk. The computer in the library where I am sitting, a nice gateway pentium 1 by the way, has a broken floppy disk drive, and of course no USB port. Therefore I am screwed. So I have decided to rant for a few minutes about the lack of technology in today's libraries.   Personally, I am against computers in libraries, particularly in school libraries. I think there is something to be said about the tactile feeling of finding a book before writing a paper. Looking my first book up alone in the card catalog is a memory that will last me the rest of my life. It was a big accomplishment, since I didn't ask the librarian or teacher to help me, and I found the book myself. Its hard for me to picture my future children not having that same experience. Just like&nbsp;it is hard for me to know that they will probably have worse handwriting than I do, (And those of you who know me, know my handwriting sucks) because I know that their teachers will demand they type their assignments, instead of being forced to decipher primitive script.   Still, if there are going to have to be computers in every day use, I really would like them to be functioning well. I really wanted to tell the librarian at that branch, that I could streamline their access to the internet, and make the webpages load faster, if she just gave me 10 minutes. I figured that they would think I was gonna hack into their system or something, so I didn't. Instead I left the library feeling like I wasted my 45 minutes. I wish I could have done something for them, because I know other people don't have the access to the internet that I do. I am lucky, I have it at home. I just use the libraries for convenience when I am out and about. As I do my job hunt, more and more I am refered to websites, and I know that there are lots of people out there who cannot apply to those jobs, because they have no access to the sites. It makes me sad, that the technology exists, but the people do not have access to it. The lines in the libraries prove it. Down here in Miami-Dade, I have witnessed people waiting an hour for their 45 minutes to send e-mail or do a job search. That is all the library can afford to give them.  &nbsp;

      Ok Folks, I am posting my first new poem in several years. I may get rid of it, since I am not sure if I like it yet...but for now...here it is:   Moanings at 3 in the Morning   I ache, deep in my soul, where does it come from? why can't it stop? I try so hard, so hard to feel like there is more to me than a reflection of melodrama. I hear the whine in my voice. I crave more, but I fear to give into  temptation. I fear giving into myself. Why don't I know what I want? Why isn't it tangible? I can't see it. I can't let go of the past. I can't picture the future. Dreams fall away, carving a hole in reality. Leaving me empty.

      “The Eyes of Texas are upon you, all the livelong day. The eyes of Texas are upon you. You cannot get away…” is a line that conjures up memories of baseball caps and very loud marching bands. In Austin, that song is sung at every sporting event UT has. Even though, I never attended UT Austin, the songs, and the spirit are ingrained in me. I found myself recently making fun of Aggies (graduates of Texas A&M) with a friend of a friend over dinner. She had lived in Dallas. I had lived in Austin. We had nothing in common, but that was enough. We were able to converse like good friends, after a couple drinks and a round of Aggie-bashing. I’ve discovered, since leaving Texas there are two types of people…people who have been to Texas, and people who have not. People who have been to Texas, even the ones that hate it, never completely put down the state. The people, who have never gone to the state, are the ones who bash it.   I admit, it is the state that brought us two President Bushes, but it is also the state that brought us President Johnson…so in a way, it will all balance out in the end. Well, maybe not, but this is not a treatise comparing the presidents who came out of Texas. What is this exactly? I’m not sure. I guess in a way it has to do with poetry, and the song, “Yellow Rose of Texas.” I was recently exposed to the fact that any poem by Emily Dickinson can be sung to the music of “Yellow Rose.” If Ms. Dickinson was writing her poetry today, she might choose to have it come out that way…. just to poke fun at the state of Texas. Instead, it is just another one of those things that people with too much time on their hands discover on the Internet.

      I watch the people around me searching for love. They cling to each other in some dark misshapen attempt to exorcise the demons within them. They call physical attraction and a sense of trust, love. It makes me wonder, as my friends’ marriages break up, and others find their soul mates, where does the line exist…and how do we define love? Most days I take a Supreme Court’s definition of pornography approach to love, “I’ll know it when I see it.” Still it makes me wonder, as the happy couple turns into the shrill single…what are we all really searching for? In my quest to find answers, to questions yet unasked out loud, I have turned to poetry. I just finished Stephen Dunn’s book  Different Hours , the book that won him the Pulitzer Prize. It was impressive, and a bit overwhelming, to read his words and connect with them so forcefully…but this poem entitled “Their Divorce” really illustrates how I feel each time I watch the friends in my life separate from each other:   Their Divorce  &nbsp; Not them. Not even with the best binoculars&nbsp; on the bluest day could I have seen it coming. Not with scrutiny’s microscope, or with the help of history or gossip.  Of all the people, not them.  They hadn’t fallen in love with others.  Not even a night of drink or proximity’s slow burn drove them  to lapse, say, with a coworker. It means no one can know what goes on in the pale trappings of bedrooms,  in anyone’s secret harrowed heart.  It makes time itself an executioner- a fact I always knew applied to couples  whose bodies contradicted their Darling this, Honey that, and even some who exhibited  true decency and respect. But this is a mockery, a defeat. My friends were perfect, perfect. “Every married couple appearing together in public is comic,” Adorno said, and I wrote “Stupid!” in the margin. Now they’re broken up, finished. Oh Adorno, you son of a bitch, you perspicacious bastard, sometimes what a cold eye sees lasts longer than any of us.    Copyright 2000 by Stephen Dunn  &nbsp; Stephen Dunn is a new discovery, only recently introduced to me by the fact that he won the Pulitzer and his book was in the Miami Dade Public Library. I should own more poetry than I do. I used to devour it like pancakes for Sunday morning breakfast. Now, I only nibble at the edges of it, like its expensive caviar, and I don’t want to finish off the last cracker.   Still, back in my feasting off poetry days, I consumed a vast quantity of Anne Sexton…probably at too early an age to understand what she really meant, and definitely at a time when I could not discern all metaphors from real life. I am not ranting about my history in this message, I am making allusions to poems that make me think about the break ups of friends. I probably should just sit down and write my own poems, but since I am wary of opening that Pandora’s box, I will post an Anne Sexton poem that also makes me think about the shredding of the heart. It is called, “The Wedding Ring Dance,” and was published in  45 Mercy Street  in 1976.   THE WEDDING RING DANCE  &nbsp; I dance in circles holding the moth of the marriage, thin, sticky, fluttering its skirts, its webs. The moth oozing a tear, Or is it a drop of urine? The moth, grinning like a pear, or is it teeth clamping the iron maiden shut?  The moth, who is my mother, who is my father, who was my lover, floats airily out of my hands and I dance slower, pulling off the fat diamond engagement ring, pulling off the elopement wedding ring, and holding them, clicking them in a thumb and forefinger, the indent of twenty-five years,  like a tiny rip leaving its mark, the tiny rip of a tiny earthquake, Underneath the soil lies the violence, the shift, the crack of continents, the anger, and above only a cut,  a half inch space to stick a pencil in.  The finger is scared but it keeps its long numb place, And I keep dancing, a sort of waltz, clicking the two rings,  all of a life at its last cough, as I swim through the air of the kitchen, and the same radio plays its songs and I make a small path through them with my bare finger and my funny feet, doing the undoing dance, on April 14th 1973, letting my history rip itself off me and stepping into something unknown and transparent,  but all ten fingers stretched outward, flesh extended as metal waiting for a magnet.   &nbsp; I read that poem the first time fifteen years ago. Then, I saw it as a piece reminiscing about the wedding. Then again, I was 11, and not nearly as cynical as I am now. Me, cynical? Nah…never!!! I think that is part of why I am writing this blog…in order to stop hiding me. I have written other things, and put them out there, but I was always afraid of what people would think, so I censored myself. I am sick of having to choose between friends as they separate…but in order to stay a good friend…I don’t tell them so. I just write it in my blog so anyone in the world can read it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      The undertoad is strong today. That irrepressible feeling that something bad is going to happen. Nothing bad may happen. I may be fine today. It may be yet another day, full of banter and nostalgia, but it could be painful and scarring at the same time. I cannot get out of my head today. All I want to do is sleep, but I am stuck in the middle of a traffic jam on 95. I wonder, if I napped right now, would anyone notice?   I write sonnets in my head as the radio blares. Who cares about being springtime fresh? Why is the triangle considered an instrument in elementary school music classes? Isn’t it just there so the kids who cannot carry a tune can participate?   The air conditioner kicks off. It keeps doing that, stopping in the middle of 100 degree days…as if to remind me it does not want to be down in Miami…it prefers the cold of the Buffalo winter. I remember when we bought the car…it is white…”A Florida color” my father said. I had declared that the only color car I did not want was white. I drive a white car in Florida.   In Buffalo, during snowstorms, my car would get buried and completely blend in. I used to think of it as one of those monkeys that live in Nepal, near the hot springs….you never see them until you get right on top of them…or they dive into the hot water to warm up.   Now my car is easily spotted in every parking lot. It glows like a radioactive sheep. I can hear it saying, “Baaaaahhhh, baaaahhhhh” as I turn it on. It likes me, my little Iris does, yes I named my car…but it does not like having to run its air conditioner during the Miami afternoons.   I keep half a bicycle in the back seat. Just the wheels, for they are easily accessible for spinning at long stop signs. I see them sometimes, and tell myself I should put them in my storage locker, but I never do. Other times, I look at them, and think,&nbsp; I could make a really great diorama of&nbsp; the solar system with them…but then I remember…no one in the real world makes dioramas.   Then I realize, that is the reason adults become elementary school teachers. They have dreams of leading children in creating dioramas, so they go back, into the cavernous halls from which they came. I need to be more specific in my reference there, but I really don’t want to be, so I won’t.   I will just go back to driving along 95, and wondering why it is that everyone else is on the road with me…do they also have no where to go? Hello Mr. Undertoad, I’ve been expecting you…   For those of you who do not know, the undertoad is a reference to  The World According to Garp  by John Irving .

      Several years ago, my friend Rimma and I made a pact. We would take the Foreign Service Written Exam, everytime it is offered by the State Department, until one of us passes it, or one of us moves out of the suburbs of Buffalo NY. That pact lasted through one all-day Saturday exam.&nbsp;Rimma decided not to take it again, but that did not stop me from religiously signing up the next time around and the next time. Yes, I took the exam three times. I wasted three Saturdays, trying to remember the dates of the Franco-Prussian War and why Alexander Hamilton was famous. I still don't know the dates of the Franco-Prussian war.&nbsp;I was such a&nbsp;mascochist, I opted to take the exam&nbsp;once I moved out of Buffalo, and down here to Miami. I gave up attending a large party for my office, in order to sit in a university auditiorium and once again&nbsp;remember what "opportunity cost" means in economic terms. Finally, my wasted Saturdays paid off. Today, I received a letter from the State Department, letting me know I&nbsp;passed the exam, and have been invited to interview with them. I know all that means is I made it over the first hurdle. I know there are a lot more before I can say I work for the State Department, but today, just for today, I plan on reveling in the fact that I accomplished something that&nbsp;very&nbsp;few people in the country even attempt to do. YAY ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;

       These articles&nbsp;are actually from the AP "News Of The Weird" on Yahoo:   Vandal Edits Swear Words in Library Books      Tue Jul 20, 7:46 PM ET       Add  urlLink Strange News - AP  to My Yahoo!   LAYTON, Utah - A self-appointed editor of library books has given new meaning to "purple prose." The do-it-yourself censor is turning swear words into "darns" and "hecks" — in purple ink.       &nbsp;  "They believe it's within their right to deface public property and impose what they believe on others," library director Pete Giacoma said.   "It's a crime. It would be prosecuted if we were to find who did it, by luck or accident," he said.   Destroying or defacing library materials is a class B misdemeanor. It's punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine, but Giacoma said the library usually will settle for restitution.   "I think the worry of the public, every once in a while, is that we're doing it," he said. "We're not."   Giacoma said in cases like this, the vandals will usually tire of editing books and stop on their own.    And now for article number 2:    Alleged Library Book Thief Sparks Chase      Mon Jul 19, 2:01 PM ET       Add  urlLink U.S. National - AP  to My Yahoo!  By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer  SYRACUSE, N.Y. - A 36-year-old man led police on a brief car chase, driving on sidewalks, through parking lots and even against traffic on a busy boulevard, so he wouldn't get caught with stolen library books, according to police.       &nbsp;  "The officers were a little taken back when they found out what the deal was. They couldn't believe it," said Syracuse police spokesman Sgt. Tom Connellan, who added police broke off pursuit because the situation Sunday became too dangerous.   "It was stupid and reckless," said Connellan.   There were no injuries, and — even more amazingly, Connellan said — no property damage.   Byron Haynes of Syracuse was to be arraigned Monday in Syracuse City Court on misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, petit larceny and reckless driving, as well as numerous traffic infractions.   Haynes offered no explanation to police when he was arrested, Connellan said.   Connellan did not have the titles or authors of the five stolen books but said they all dealt with Jewish religion. The books were swiped from Syracuse University's Bird Library, which has substantial holdings of rare books, manuscripts and collections, including original writings of authors Joyce Carol Oates and Dr. Benjamin Spock, 19th-century reformer Gerritt Smith and transcontinental railway builder Collis Huntington.   "Our special collections are kept on the sixth floor. Access to that area is very regulated. These were taken off the shelves that everyone has access to," said Kevin Morrow, a university spokesman.   Haynes was not a university student, Morrow said.   An officer spotted Haynes running a stop sign about 4:30 p.m. Sunday near the library. Moments earlier, a suspect had fled the building with the stolen books, setting off the building's alarms as he ran out the doors.   The car chase lasted about 10 minutes. A dozen police cruisers were involved, although only three or four chased Haynes. During the chase, officers saw the suspect toss a backpack out the car window, Connellan said. When they recovered it, they found the stolen books.   "We assumed it was drugs or guns the way he was driving," Connellan said. "We even brought in a canine to go through the car. Nothing."   Onondaga County deputies in a helicopter tracked Haynes until he tried to ditch his car at a city park. City police arrested him after a short foot chase.   Connellan said investigators were doing a background check on Haynes.    So this sparks the question....Why are libraries so contraversial all of a sudden?

      I have started writing poetry, again, and am going to post some on here soon. To prepare myself for the inevitable doubts about doing that, I am posting some stuff I used to have posted on my website...that I still have posted on that site. I hope you enjoy it....and I promise new stuff soon.   Writing by Candlelight   Scraps of paper, ripped and torn; like a heart on the edge of commitment. dividing time between pleasure and procrastination. knowing that to leap the chasmwould force consciousness. not wanting to wake from this dream. Embedded in the torn up letters, words, sentences, admitting the truth and the birth of the knowledge that loneliness is fatal.     For You, Whatever Name You Use   So you know my secret, the iridescent knowledge of my heart as, if you'd dined on it the night before Where are you thinking as I write these lines? The glow of your heartbeat next to me, bathing my senses in an acid overflow, Can it cleanse my soul? Through sleepless eyes, I stare at you, trying to bore a hole through your hormone encased shell, The soundtrack in my head has stopped. Someone pushed pause. Your dialogue starts, but the snoring in the background keeps me from hearing you clearly.

      "Someone to touch your hair, someone who cares.....Reach out and touch me!" I am not sure if that is what the words are for that song. Still it feels right. I have come to the realization I spend an inordinate amount of time alone. As I job hunt, I am alone. As I drive, I am alone. I eat alone, watch TV alone, go to the movies alone, drink alone, read alone and feel sorry for myself for being alone...alone. Still its funny, most of the time I revel in being alone. Since moving back in with the parental units, they spend so much time wanting to know what is going on with my life, that being alone felt good. That is, until being alone became lonely. Now all I want are a group of friends I can call upon to no longer be alone.

      I am a 26 single straight woman who believes in defending my right to get married. I have a right to not be asked by friends and relatives whether I am in a relationship. I have a right to tell those same friends and relatives to go to hell when they suggest I meet a "nice guy" and "settle down." I have a right to have dreams that have nothing to do with a big white dress, seven bridesmaids and losing my born again virginity on my wedding night. I have a right to have my single male friends not ask me to be their bethrothed if they do not find the woman of their dreams by the time they are thirty, or thirty-five or forty...you get the picture. I have a right to feel insulted when I am told my biological clock is ticking. I have the right to choose who I sleep with, when I sleep with them, anot not have to commit my heart and soul to good sex. I have the right to get my heart broken at least half a dozen times before I choose the right guy for me. I have the right to choose when I want to have a family, and who I want to raise my children. I have a right to all of this, as long as my choice is a straight single man...and on days like today...that does not seem like much of a choice.

      The undertoad is strong today. That irrepressible feeling that something bad is going to happen. Nothing bad may happen. I may be fine today. It may be yet another day, full of banter and nostalgia, but it could be painful and scarring at the same time. I cannot get out of my head today. All I want to do is sleep, but I am stuck in the middle of a traffic jam on 95. I wonder, if I napped right now, would anyone notice?  &nbsp;  I write sonnets in my head as the radio blares. Who cares about being springtime fresh? The rain comes pouring down, stranding me behind an 18 wheeler that takes up 4 lanes. I want to cry.  &nbsp; I want to shed tears for the woman I am, and the child I was. I want to have a home of my own, a career of my own, a life of my own, and I am sick of the protocol that is set up, that I must follow to get there. Why must I follow the rules? Why can't I be exempt? Why won't the headaches stop?  &nbsp; Why must everything be in triplicate, and typed, and double spaced? I wish just once I could stop the pain...that creeps into every decision I make...every part of my being...everything I create. Everyone judges me, and expects me to judge them in return. I am tired of judging...can't I just enter for the fun of it?  &nbsp; I hurt, am tired and hate my life....I thought it was supposed to get easier as we got older? Why does it just get harder? Why doesn't trying our best count for anything anymore?

      I was just in Barnes and Noble looking for a magazine. It occured to me as I stared at the stacks, that there was not one "womens interest" magazine that interested me. Sure, I have read my share of Cosmo and Marie Claire...find me one PMSing woman who has not consumed the trash at some point in time...and I will show you a liar. Cosmo is like chocolate, it makes you feel good, or bad, depending on how much you consume. Still, I have no desire to learn how to give a better blowjob, get a man to be interested in me just by wearing a specific scent during the summer solstice or figure out which shade of white works best on my skintone.  &nbsp;  So I wonder, why is there no "mens interest" section? There are sports magazines, hobby magazines, political magazines and everything else, but men do not have their own interests. Don't men want to know how to give better head, or if black really will make&nbsp; them look slimmer?  &nbsp;  Wait a second, of course they don't, because the magazine publishing world is aware that they have a brain. The magazine world just assumes, that because I ovulate, that I am interested in magazines about weddings, there were 30 different magazines there, all about being a better bride....and even more about how to have a good pregnancy...and how to be a good parent. Why are there&nbsp;no mens magazines about good parenting? Isn't parenting a two person job?  &nbsp;  The older I get, the more my attitudes return to the time when I was in middle school. Back then, I could not understand the "womens interest" section. I also had no desire to comprehend it. Clothes were nothing more than the thing I put on in the morning. Makeup was for other people...an alien substance that I wasn't sure I ever wanted to experience. Somedays I miss that time in my life.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Today my father died. No, not today, in the year 2004, but today, in my mind 12 years ago. Twelve years ago today, my father received a heart transplant, and 12 years ago I killed him off in my mind. For one brief moment, I considered life without him in it. I was fourteen years old.  &nbsp;  I spent most of my conscious life with one idea in my head: my father is dying. I remember in kindergarten, explaining to a class of five year olds what a quadruple bypass surgery was.&nbsp; I was more than a precocious child. I was a freak. I had myself pegged that way from that point on.  &nbsp;  I didn’t really think I was that strange till third grade, when I realized other children didn’t come home to empty houses and messages on the fridge saying, “Gone to the hospital, there is money for pizza on the counter. Don’t watch too much TV. Get your homework done. We’ll go to the hospital after school tomorrow. I’ll pick you up early. Love, Mom.”  &nbsp;  Other girls spent their pre-teen years fawning over crushes. I spent mine trying to sleep on orange vinyl couches and molded plastic chairs. I never learned what the latest clothing trends were, but I knew where to get the best sodas and snacks in any hospital in downtown Buffalo. Perfumes were never my thing, but I liked that they drowned out the stench of the emergency room.  &nbsp;  On the day my father got his transplant, we admitted him to Buffalo General Hospital. It was a beautiful sunny day, with temperatures about 80 degrees. I remember thinking I wanted to go swimming that afternoon. I was a bit angry that he was in the hospital, since that meant I could not go to the public pool. I didn’t want to go swimming in our back yard, since the pool was so small I could stand up easily and it felt like I was in a big bathtub. I gave up on the idea of swimming, or doing anything fun, and resigned myself to a day of drawing ill-conceived faces and reading three-month-old People Magazine.  &nbsp;  Coming back from the hospital, we stopped at Burger King. We went through the drive-thru and ate the burgers in the car. We passed the airport, and were almost home. I suggested to my mom that I go for a bike ride. I needed to clear my head. I needed to get away. I needed to keep going and going and never stop. She agreed it was a good idea. We got into the driveway and she put up the garage. I grabbed my bike, rode it up to the car and gave her a kiss on the cheek as she walked to the mailbox to get the mail.  &nbsp;  I started to pedal hard. Pushing my muscles harder and faster, I careened forward not wanting to stop. I remember my right leg cramped from sudden activity after hours of sitting, but I didn’t care. I kept pushing. As I rode, I cried.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;I got thirsty, and had no water bottle with me so I stopped at a diner owned by my former best friends’ family. Their father was glad to see me. He gave me a soda and let me sit for a few since I was red in the face and out of breathe. The fifties nostalgia diner was sea foam green and white, with splotches of pink and coca-cola signs everywhere. I drank down my coke, listening to the jukebox playing, “Daniel” by Elton John.  “Daniel is leaving tonight on a plane. I can see the red taillights….and I can see Daniel waving goodbye Lord it looks like Daniel. Must be the clouds in my eyes.” I sat there, my eyes still stinging with tears, and I let my father die.  &nbsp;  I closed my eyes and I saw the future. My father’s funeral, the hundreds of people turning out to say what a brilliant sun of a bitch he was, my immediate family in pain, and my extended family squabbling over everything from the will to the way the priest conducted himself. My siblings’ weddings, occurring in my mind over the next five years, without my father there to make sure the functions happened according to his traditions. My mother in white….lots and lots of white. White is such a hard color to clean.  &nbsp;  I understood then why Hindus wore white as the mourning color. With white, on dusty roads, you must be aware of yourself. You must always be conscious of what you are wearing. You must be careful every time you eat or drink. You never forget the person who died.  &nbsp;  I saw my high school graduation, my college graduation and every other milestone in my life. I saw the probability of moving to Texas to be closer to more extended family, or Washington DC for the same reason. I saw my mother working. I saw us losing the house I grew up in, or selling it to help my sister pay for graduate school. I saw me and my mother in a cramped apartment in downtown Buffalo. I saw all of this, and I decided it was ok. I resigned myself to the idea that my father was going to die. I gave up on him.  &nbsp;  I left the diner, after thanking Mr. Harrishburg for the soda, and headed out again. Once again pushing my legs hard, feeling the pain and pushing for more. I whipped past the houses of friends who had known me since the day I was born. I stopped and rang their doorbell, hoping to get a game of catch out of them, or at least a drink of water. No one was home.  &nbsp;  The tears stopped. I felt empty. I had accepted my father’s death, and the inevitability that came with it. I turned my bike around and slowly started for home. I pulled into my driveway, and my mother pulled in behind me. She was honking the car horn like she was in a parade. I turned and watched her waving frantically for me. I ditched my bike on the front lawn, not even putting down the kickstand, and ran to the car. “We got the heart! We’re going to Cleveland! Put your bike in the garage, and go get packed!”  &nbsp;  I started to cry. I had thought no more tears could come, but out they came. My mother thought they were tears of joy, but they were self-pity. I felt guilty. I had given up. I had given up and there was still hope. I have felt guilty about that for the last twelve years.  &nbsp;  For twelve years I have made myself suffer for a lot of things in my life, but none more than that ten minutes. The ten minutes in which I allowed my father to die.  &nbsp;  Recently, I encountered head-on my unforgiving nature and how hard I am on my adolescent self. My friend invited me to hear a choral concert of Elton John songs. I sat there in the audience, and heard “Daniel” for the first time in twelve years. For the past twelve years, I avoided it. If it came on the radio, I changed the station. I never bought any Elton John albums and I drowned it out with conversation if it was played in restaurants.  &nbsp;  In a theater, I could not run away from it. I sat there, and allowed it to wash over me. I was fourteen again, and angry at the world. I was fourteen again, and angry with my father for being sick. I was fourteen again, and giving up. My heart seemed to stop as they sang it, the song that was the aural impression of my subconscious disassociation with my father. I sat there and cried, and wanted to run. I am not a rude person, so I suffered through it. I listened to the lyrics, and remembered. I allowed the emotions to coarse through me. I started to forgive the innocent fourteen year old. Which is why, for the first time in twelve years, I can write about this, without just recounting a narrative.

      I saw the best minds of my generation consumed by madness. That line has been throbbing in my head for the past 48 hours. When does it become more than just a song in the head, since the lines from the poem are put to a pithy pop-rock beat? When does it truly become madness...madness as in the victorian age, with fainting couches and corsets and high tea? It all makes no sense, this ability to have a tune floating in our minds for hours at a time. And yet we listen to music.

      Both these quotes were overheard on an ABC TV show. The show was about television shows that were only pilots and never aired. They were just too funny not to write down:  "What could be more adorable than a boy and his troll?"  "Have you ever had a man stand behind you and kiss you on the back of your knees?"  I know this is not a big post, but I will write more later. This week I have been celebrating my parents' 39th wedding anniversary and my sister's 36th birthday. Plus we are moving Mehala into her apartment here in Miami. I'm kinda tired.  I do promise more later. *SMILE*

      I just lived through the second hurricane of my adult life. In the first one, I was living in DC. It was 1999, and I blacked out in my apartment, so I had to go to Georgetown Medical Center for observation. My boyfriend at the time wanted me to come out to his place to ride out the hurricane. We had a huge fight since my mother wanted me to go to my uncle’s house in Maryland. I preferred staying with the boyfriend, but I did not want to worry my folks more than I already was worrying them. So off to the wilds of Northern Maryland I went. I don’t remember much, except that when I returned to campus, there were tree branches everywhere.  This time around, the hurricane missed us. It went up the gulf coast, and all we got was one storm at one-thirty in the morning on Friday morning. It was an amazing sight to watch. I was completely awe-struck by the power of nature. Still, it was just a really harsh storm and not the actual hurricane.  I did not see the fall-out of the hurricane until yesterday. My father and I went to a Muslim wedding. It was my father’s first Muslim wedding, and my second. The wedding was that of a cousin of mine…of sorts.  The true family connection is through the husbands of two of my aunts. These men are first cousins to the groom’s father. The family raised their children Hindu, but the groom had become a Muslim.  On our way to the wedding, my father and I conversed about my life. We talked about relationships, my siblings and my sister’s impending arrival in South Florida. I had been expecting cautionary tales, warning me not to turn out like my siblings. I get those about once a month from him. Instead, thanks in part to a mix tape with  Shania Twain  and  10000 Maniacs  on it, we made it to the wedding with no tears, and a few laughs.  I had never been at a wedding before, where I was afraid to talk to the men. I guess afraid is the wrong word. I was uncomfortable speaking with them. I offered my hand to the groom when I first arrived, and he refused it because I was a woman. I had dealt with that before, but usually with men of Arab decent and they are a lot more gracious about it. They understand that in the US men and women shake hands upon meeting each other. This guy looked insulted that I had offered him my hand.  I spent the wedding talking to the bride’s parents: a nice American couple from the Fort Myers area. They were having a hard time dealing with their daughter’s newfound faith in Islam. Still they were there to support her and her decision to marry a man she had met on the Internet.  Most of Fort Myers had no electricity or running water, including the mosque where the wedding was taking place. Before the wedding, my dad and I went to  Publix  to get a soda. The supermarket was crowded with people, but we were warned as we came in that there was no frozen food, produce or refrigerated items. So we enjoyed a warm coke and drove to the mosque.  The Imam was two hours late. This was the first wedding I ever attended where the reception occurred before the wedding. Everyone was roasting in the heat, since the interior of the mosque was even hotter than outside. There I sat, in heavy emerald green silk with tons of gold embroidery, feeling like I was the wicked witch of the west. The phrase, “I’m melting! I’m melting!” barely even covered the way I felt.  All around us were broken tree limbs and other debris. If I had not seen the intersections without signal lights, and the fact that even taco bell was closed, I would have thought that they had just experienced a bad thunderstorm. I saw some interesting angles for photographs, but realized the wedding party did not have a photographer. I used film on them instead.  Finally, the Imam showed up. He claimed he was late because he was stuck behind President Bush’s motorcade. They held the ceremony outdoors, so we didn’t die of heat stroke. If they had held it inside, I would have had to sit separately than my father. Since it was outdoors, we were allowed to sit together.  It was weird. In the other Muslim ceremony I witnessed, the bride opted to represent herself before God. In other words, she said her own vows. In this ceremony, the bride asked another gentleman from the mosque to recite her vows. So instead of the bride and groom holding hands, the groom clasped hands with this man, and the bride sat to the side looking a bit lost.  The ceremony itself was ten minutes. At the end of it, my father and I said our goodbyes and hopped into the car. I drove, and sped all the way to the other side of the state. On our way home, we stopped for barbecue. I ordered pork. I guess I’m never gonna be a good Muslim.

      I have not written for several days. For the most part, I have been busy. Work has been happening on a more reasonable level, and I joined bookcrossing.com. Bookcrossing.com was going to be the subject of this blog, since it is my new passion du jour. I had the anecdotes all planned out in my head, and knew how the paragraphs were going to flow, and then this morning my father decided to take a car ride to the auto mechanic and turn it into a family history lesson.  He wanted to talk about my grandfather. For the most part, when I think the term grandfather, I mean only one man. My mother’s father was never in my life. I never met him, and my mother’s mother signed the lonely birthday cards I would receive every year. Still, I digress. I was writing this about my father’s father.  In my family, everyone called my grandfather “Anna.” It is pronounced Un-Nah, and in Sanskrit means, “big brother.” The irony did not get past me when I read 1984 by George Orwell. In so many ways, Anna was the “big brother.” Every person who came into the house, and every phone call, had to be introduced to him, or summarized for him. He had to know everything.  He had been a government official in India. He was a highly respected man in South India, both in the British government and in the subsequent Indian government. Anna was respected and feared by people. He was forced into retirement at a relatively young age by circumstances beyond his control. He was only in his 50s.  For the first ten years of my life, he lived in our house in Buffalo New York. He moved in when I was three weeks old and did not leave for 10 years. He had the downstairs bedroom, which had originally been designed to be a den and laundry room. The room barely fit the furniture we squeezed in it: a bed, bookshelves, and easy chair were pretty much it. We recently sold the house, and walking into that room with it being empty, made it feel so much smaller than it felt when it was full. Partly I think it was full because my grandfather had such a profound effect on my life.  Most children have two parents, I had five. I really do think, I was parented in their own way, by both my siblings and my grandfather. My siblings, bossed me around like kids do, and because they did, I became an experiment in pavlovian conditioning. They didn't need a pet, they had me.  My grandfather bossed me around as well. We also fought, more like we were siblings than grandfather and grandchild. I remember screaming matches over the television. I wanted to watch  Scooby-Doo , and he wanted to watch  Hawaii Five-O.  He always won those arguments, but I always put up a good fight.  I remember a broken man, who really wanted to be independent, but knew he was claimed on his son's tax return. It hurt him a lot. He used secrets and intrigue within our family, to get some kind of power. His powermongering hurt our family in a lot of ways...ways that are still being expressed eleven years after his death.  This year, for the first time my father did not join his siblings in honoring the anniversary of his father's death. He did not even tell me it was the anniversary. My mother told me he fasted that day, but there was no pomp and circumstance. Its funny, considering the ceremony that the family has always had to honor him. Part of me wonders why...why we follow the rituals and why...after a while...we let them fall to the wayside and just continue to live our life.

      Sometimes it is not so bad, living in the spare bedroom of the people who created me. After all, I am not paying for rent, food, utilities or any of the other things that people my age struggle to pay for month after month. Yes, I am trying to see the bright side of it all. After months of job hunting, I am still no closer to a full time position than I was in November 2003 when I was sequestered here. I try not to complain, or to feel depressed, but it is as bad as living in the parents' basement...except this time I am trapped on the 24th floor of a highrise condo. For those of you who do not like or know me well, I don't like heights like that. I don't freak out, but I also don't go out on the balcony, at all...unless circumstances beyond my control force me.  Lately I have been forced out onto the balcony more and more, by life and situations involving the parental units. It is easier to go there than to run screaming from the house at 2 in the morning when my mother is online plugging away at her own blog, and all I want to do is check my e-mail for five minutes. My mother stays up later than I do, and my father wakes up early. So, basically there is no time alone, unless they are both going someplace together, or at the same time.  So I spend tons of time locked in my room, with the television on in the background, reading, or doing one of my many hobbies. Ok so this piece says nothing more than what is going on each and everyday in my life...but sometimes that is for the best.

      I keep discovering strange things growing in my backseat. I guess I should back up. In the back seat of my car, I keep one half of a bicycle (the quick release wheels and seat), a bicycle rack, various computer components for work and personal use, books from my own collection and the public library, clothing for various stages of Miami weather and three or four pairs of shoes. I also keep back there papers that I need, most of which are not actually important, but I feel should not yet be shredded, various tools, for use in the car, my jewelry making tools, and generic brand breakfast bars in both strawberry and mixed berry flavors.  Even with all that stuff in the backseat of my car, it must have taken a bolt of lightning hitting it or something, because last night I discovered my library and personal books had reproduced. My silly romance novels, and books by Arthur Schlesinger and Jennifer Hochschild have had a secret liaison and produced a love child unlike any I had ever seen. It is definitely something out of Mary Shelly’s  Frankenstein . I discovered in my backseat a book entitled  Thieves in High Places  by Jim Hightower.  I know I did not purchase this hardcover concoction, and it has not remnants from the library, so my only course of deduction is it was created from sexual or asexual reproduction. Since I highly doubt  The Ecology of Commerce: A Declaration of Sustainability  mutated during mitosis to create some new tuber, and such a different book from its parent. I see no choice but to believe that my books are practicing non-safe sex.  I really must talk to them about this behavior, because bastard love children take up a lot of space, and like all books, make me want to read them. I barely have time for the oodles of books I have on the public library’s hold list. Still, I took the book in my arms and tried to read it during dinner last night. I could barely get passed the first chapter. It felt as poorly written as right-wing rhetoric, yet it was from the left.  And so I will conclude this piece of backseat melodrama. I need to go out to my car, see if there are any radioactive spiders inside of it, and have a serious conversation with my books. They need to learn that unsafe sex has consequences, since I don’t want to get a call from the public library complaining that their books are diseased.

      Tuesday morning I crawled out of bed about noon and was confronted with yet another test of my strength. My mother announced to me that she thinks she had a heart attack two days before. She had called the doctor, but could not get an appointment until Friday morning. It is now Thursday afternoon, and I have been feeling like an elephant has been kickboxing my chest ever since. Memories of the times I spent sitting in emergency rooms and waiting rooms of ICUs came flooding back to me. I have a big ache in the pit of my stomach. I know no matter what happens, it will be ok. I just want to know something now, not tomorrow and not next week.  Oh well, such is the life I lead. I'm at the library, where I usually am when I decide to pound out a rant. I just tried to access nerve.com. I was not allowed access due to content. That of course makes me curious what kind of content is on it, that I am not allowed to view? I guess the sex survey done by the unemployed for this week, may be it...but is it really that different than the stuff on slate.com? Where are they drawing the line? I love lines....they lead to slippery slopes. Slippery slopes are fun...because you never know how far down people and morality will fall.  My hands hurt, from hours of typing, and my eyes ache from staring at the screen. Why do we subject ourselves to spending hours in front of a keyboard, only to communicate with people who are no where near us? Why do we race home from work, or school to check e-mail from people we see everyday? Why do we seek this validation?  If anyone has any answers to my questions...please let me know. I am sick of trying to answer them for myself.
