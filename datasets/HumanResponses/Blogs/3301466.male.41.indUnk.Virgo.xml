      Back in 1986, while working for GE up in Utica, NY, I was on my way to a class outside of Washington, DC.   On the plane, I sat next to a nice girl named Sean, about my age, and very attractive.   As it turns out, she grew up not far from me, and had recently graduated law school.   We had a pleasant flight and it seemed like both of us hit it off.  After the plane landed, we said our good-byes, and I went to retrieve my luggage and head for the rental counter.  That's where the trouble began.   As this was my first solo business trip, I had never rented a car before.   To no surprise, they asked me for my driver's license.   I pulled out my wallet but my license was not there.   Did I put it in my pocket?   (This was long before 9/11, so you didn't need I.D. to get on the plane).   I thought back to the past few days to see if I could remember the last time I'd seen my license.  And then it hit me...  While driving to NYC, this past weekend (see  My First Big East Tournament  story), I was given a speeding ticket on the NY thruway.   Flashing back now, I can see myself throwing my license in anger into the console of my car.     So I'm standing at the Hertz counter without a license.   My class is about 40 minutes away in Rockville, MD.   A cab would be out of the question.  I asked the woman if I had any options, and she asked me if I knew anyone in town, presumably to give me a ride, but I thought she meant to help me rent the car.  I didn't know anyone in DC, but then from across the room, I saw Sean, the girl from the plane, getting her luggage.   I called her over.   I explained to her about my class , "Sean, I forgot my license and they won't rent me a car without it.   Do you have a license?"  She said, "Sure, what do I need to do?"  The woman from Hertz quickly jumped in to stop Sean from helping.    "You can't use YOUR license, with HIS credit card.", she said.  I don't know what I was thinking, perhaps the desperation from not having an option, I timidly asked Sean, "Do you have a credit card?"  Before Sean could respond, the lady at Hertz vehomently objected:   "Don't do it.  You don't know this guy.  This would be your rental car.   He could steal the car and you would be responsible".  By this time, the Hertz people had tripled in number with three people telling Sean not to do this.  They quickly pointed out that I would not be a legal driver and that she would be 100% responsible.  I begged Sean to help me out.   I tried to convince her of what a nice guy I was.    Well apparently, our two hour flight trumped several years of law school.  She agreed to rent me the car.  I promised I would not use the car for anything but to get to my class.  I would have my licensed fedex'd down the next day and I would switch the car over to my license and credit card.     After a few more minutes of scolding and warnings from Hertz, we walked to the rental car.    "Can I at least get a ride home?", Sean asked.  "Are you kidding, you have to drive, I'm not allowed", I said jokingly.  When we got to the car, Sean suggested that she should drive.  Not for legal reasons so much, but that it would be easier to get to her apartment.     While leaving the airport Sean recalled that this was my first trip to Washington.  "You should see the monuments at night.  They're really pretty.", Sean said.  "Let's do it", I countered.  "Why not", said Sean.      And this started a two hour after dark tour of DC and Georgetown.  It was close to 10pm by the time we got to Sean's apartment.   I would love to turn this into a Penthouse forum letter but that's not how it happened.   Since I had to still drive to Rockville that night, we said our good-nights and that I would call her when I got the car taken care of.  I made it to my hotel around 11pm safe and sound.  Two days later, I had my license via Fedex.  I took the Metro to Washington National to switch over the rental car.    (As it turns out, I could have used the Metro for almost my entire trip but who knew.)   I called Sean that night and told her everything was taken care of.   She was glad to hear from me as apparently she had been taking a lot of abuse at work about her extreme generosity.   I offered to take her out to dinner any time and any place that she wanted.  She chose Thursday night and a place called Nathan's in Georgetown.    We had a great dinner and then walked around Georgetown at night.   We laughed about what a weird week it had been.  We said we would keep in touch, but never did.   I was seeing someone and she was too.   I will never forget those few days in Washington and that rental car.

      Back in 1986, my brother Steve and I had the chance to go to our first Big East Tournament.   Steve and I had been Syracuse basketball fans for years and never had the chance to get tickets.   I had been offered tickets from a college friend who now lives in Connecticut (this was before UConn got good).  Unfortunately, I was working a new job at GE and my boss Sam (a real jerk) was really strict about taking vacation.  I told Sam I needed a couple of days vacation in early March, but he told me that I only had two weeks vacation coming and that I would have to save them for the summer (when the plant was shutdown).  I found out later that this policy was never inforced.  Well, there was no way I was going to miss this road trip and my beloved Orangemen, led by Pearl Washington, at Madison Square Garden.  So I came up with a plan: I would just call in sick on Thursday and Friday.  No problem ?   Wrong.  On early Thursday morning, Steve and I loaded up the car and started off on our trip to NYC.   About an hour into the trip, from the NY state thruway, I called in sick.  Not 10 minutes later, I got a speeding ticket.  Instant Karma.   After getting my license back from the cop, I threw it into the console of my car.   (This will play a role in a future story).     We had a great time the rest of Thursday.  Syracuse won and the parties in Manhattan were great.   On Friday, I called in sick from my hotel.   Another fantastic day in New York, Syracuse won again and advanced to the Finals against Chris Mullins' St Johns Redmen.  On Saturday morning, a friend called and said we had a problem.   My co-worker, Phil Rothstein, said that Sam had tried to contact me.  Since my brother and I were roommates, and both of us were here, I knew he would reach our answering machine.  Well that wasn't good enough for Sam.   He decided to call my parents.   See my dad and Sam had known each other at GE for years and Sam thought I might be at my parents house.   Lucky for me, my parents were in Florida for a spring vacation.     What I didn't plan on was my sister Shelley surprising everyone by coming home from college for the weekend.  I didn't tell Shelley about my plan, but she did know that Steve and I were going to NY for the weekend.  When Sam called my parents, she answered the phone and told Sam that I was in Manhattan.  Rats.  She didn't mention the tournament, but Sam was still suspicious.  After talking to my sister, Sam grilled my friend Phil (who WAS in on my plan).     "Have you heard from Dan?", Sam asked.  "I think he's out sick again", said Phil.  "Well I heard he was in New York", Sam countered.  Without missing a beat, Phil, who is really quick witted, responded.  "New York, oh my god, is it serious?  Is something wrong?"  "I don't know, but I'm going to find out." said Sam.  Well back in NYC, Steve and I had a tough decision to make.   Should we forgo the championship game, and drive home on Saturday afternoon.  Or should we stay in NY and enjoy the game and drive home on Sunday.   All day long I wondered if I still had a job.  We decided to stay, but with my job in jeopardy it would be hard to enjoy the game.     We watched a great Championship game come down to the wire.  With seconds to go, and down by 1, Syracuse called a time-out.   Steve and I decided that if SU won, we would stay in NY, party all night and go home tomorrow.   But if Syracuse lost, we would drive home after the game so that I could talk to my boss Sunday afternoon.     Syracuse inbounded the ball, Pearl took it to the basket, went up for the game winner.  But Walter Berry partially blocked the shot.  SU lost and we were on our way home.   On the way home, in the middle of the night we hit a blizzard.  More bad luck.  On Sunday, I went into work and saw a note on my time card that read:   "Be very careful how you charge your time. Sam.  "  Well, I took that advice and charged vacation instead of sick days.  Ironically, that's all I wanted to do in the first place.   Even more ironically, because of those two vacation days, I would later get a perfect attendance award for the year presented to me by no other than Sam, my boss.  Well, Sam and I had a rough year and he cut my raise by $1000.   At the time, I thought who cares about $1000.  But adding up that $1000 per year what has now been a 20 year career, it turned out to be a very expensive basketball tournament.  Although, I'm sure I would do it again.

      Back in 1994, Cynthia and I were out of town for a friend's wedding.  We were travelling with another couple, Joe and Johnna.   It was early Sunday morning and we were still a little buzzed from the wedding reception the night before.     While in the airport, waiting for a connecting flight, we noticed the U.S. figure skating team in the terminal, apparently we were all on the same flight.   The skaters were all in matching jackets except for Nancy Kerrigan who stood out in a black leather jacket (she was easily recognized from all the media coverage).     While waiting for her flight, a guy walked up to her and asked if she would pose for a picture.  She agreed, and posed for a quick picture.   The guy's friend could not operate the camera, so the first picture took longer than usual.  Nancy looked bothered.  After a quick camera lesson, they posed again.   And again no picture.  Now, Nancy was visibly annoyed and sat down.   After a second set of instructions (apparently these disposable cameras require a few braincells), he coaxed Nancy into a third pose.   She reluctantly agreed, and the third time was a charm.     My friends and I watched and laughed thinking we might go over and make a clever comment but alas it was time to board the plane.   A missed opportunity ?   No.  Apparently, the U.S. team doesn't carry much weight with the airlines as they were in coach, several rows behind us, near the back of the plane.   Johnna and I laughed and said we may never get a chance like this again.  When we landed, I got my camera out of my bag and waited for the team to get off the plane (Nancy was last).    As I approached Nancy, it went something like this:  "Miss Kerrigan, could you do me a favor ?", I asked.  She quickly shot us down with "I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry."  Then I responded, "Could you take OUR picture ?".  Nancy was stunned.   She quickly countered with "You want what ?"  I said it will only take a minute, as I put my camera into her hand.  By this time, a crowd of people had stopped to see what was going on including the figure skating team.      Joe, Johnna, Cynthia and I quickly posed for our "photo op".   Nancy reluctantly took the picture.  I thanked her and she went on her way.  Not two seconds later, an older woman approached us and asked if we knew who that was, her husband quickly responded.  "I think they do."  To be honest, we never meant any disrespect, I just thought with all the pictures she has posed for (including the goof earlier), I doubt she remembers any of them.  I'm guessing she remembers us.  While riding the escalator out of the terminal, I already heard someone telling the story.  We knew instantly we would get some mileage out of this one.  Joe and I joked later that we should start a photo album made up of pictures of us taken by famous people.  Unfortunately, 10 years later we still only have the one.

      This is my first attempt at blogging.   As I have been told, I like to talk, so...  I created this blog for one purpose: to record my life stories.   I have told these stories to friends dozens of times over a few beers but have never written any of them down.   I hope you find them entertaining.   If so, you can buy me a virtual beer.     Oh, one more thing.   The title of this blog is "Paper For Fun".   That name came from a quote I attribute to one of my best friends in school, Billy Shaw.  For all I know, he may have heard it from someone else.   This quote illustrates my philosophy on life, and more particular about money.  I live my life by it, and have been told by friends that it has changed their outlook on life.  Here it goes:    "When you can exchange paper for fun, do it every time."
