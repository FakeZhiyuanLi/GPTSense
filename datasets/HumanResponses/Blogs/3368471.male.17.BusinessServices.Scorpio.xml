      Lets take back all the hatred  lets clean the slate lets remember back when these kids were still gay..           I'm just Wondering if anyone really knows me? I'm going to die alone just how I came in. My reasons why are simple I have no Emotion the only ones I have are Hatred and sadness. Now people are going to think I'm some kind of depressed kid or something, negative. My Hatred fuels me to go on and piss off other people. Hatred and sadness isn't something I gained threw being a teenager its from years upon years of racism, no trust, and Crazy parents. The only times I'm happy is when I'm talking to my girlfriend but she lives 50 miles away. God is laughing it up, up there.  jehova's witness came over today, I found out a couple things. we are god's Slaves, as it says in the bible Jesus Christ will resurrect us from the dead. To do what you may ask? To work for god and "make the world the paradise, the way it was suppose to be". I don't know about you but that seems like slavery to me, what the fuck is wrong with the world anyways abously god hasn't been to Puerto Rico that's a fucking paradise. I seriously cant believe people think this bullshit is going to happen and actually want it to happen. Fuck this I'm going to start ::sinning::. Get this I'm working from ages 16-iono maybe 76 and then I have to work again after I die WTF!!

      And this wonderful girl that I fell in love with is loving, caring, funny, smart, and beautiful. She is better than me in everyway, I would do anything for her, her special kiss, her lovely smile, her gorgeous eyes. everytime I think of her she makes me smile and get butterflies in my stomach she is awesome. I would give her the star themselves if I could. I wouldn't want to loose something so precious to me...

      Well... have any of you got death threats before? so he grabs by the collar while on changing downstairs, and starts talking about something I told someone the day before, which at the time I didn't know was such a big deal he somehow finds out the next day and asks me why I said that I didn't know what the hell he was talking about I thought it was one of usual gay jokes. So he tells me you said this to that girl and I'm oh yea I did, and he is like why? I'm like what kind of question is that its small talk I didn't know that I wasn't suppose to say they were going out. Anyways he is like tell her your were joking around whatever whatever... And then he says in the scariest voice ever..." I don't want any problems". I ignore it, he walks away and I continue changing he comes back like 2 minutes later saying remember what I said! I don't want no problems I don't want no problems  I'll kill you Carlos  I was like WTF!! So the whole day I'm scared as fuck all my employees asking me why I look so sad. Fucking crackhead I call him Crazy eyes so fuck McDonald's I quit this is my 2 weeks notice...  and then they ask why I'm so paranoid

      Hmmm Love is the weirdest thing ever. Yesterday I woke up not wanting her back, but today I woke up with tears&nbsp;on my face and that queasy feeling in my stomach. I dreamed about her today its was really weird, I love her so much this is so weird hmmm. well now all I said yesterday have turned into lies, so I'm a liar now w00t. THIS SUCKS AHHHHH. I fell asleep expecting to play games and watch TV on my day off and now I want to go see her but she's grounded...Love prefails over all. The letter I sent to her mom,&nbsp;I'm happy now for sending its really really weird hmm maybe her mom will call and tell me to come over iono, hope... In the dream I was talking to her maybe I'm back in love because of that iono. Now I remember what I wanted to say before.   &nbsp;   she      Her voice takes my pain away  Her hugs brings me to another world  Her kiss brings me to heaven  I could never ask for more...      &nbsp;  Grr  I love you  Stefanie    I’m sick of always hearing  All the sad songs on the radio  All day it is there to remind  An oversensitive guy  That he’s lost and alone  Yeah  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Blink182

      Wow Today was the first day in about 3 weeks that I didn't wake up with tears running down my face, I woke up with a kitten messing with me to play with it. So I woke up not loving Stefanie as much as I did last week which is a good thing, I realize now that she would never do the things I did for her and that she really wasn't in love with me well at one point she had a deep crush... I know this because she would still be with me if she loves me, I don't hate her I'm just realizing what everyone has been telling me for the past 3 weeks that " if she truly loves you she would be with you now ". I quit trying to make her fall in love with me because I know now that you cant change people. I love her so much and I just want the best for her she doesn't care about me because I know now she is thinking about her grounded boyfriend and not me. I don't want to live life without regrets and I'm not going to because I know I tried with all I had to get her back with me, she just doesn't love me. She says she is confused but if she "confused" why is she with him and not with no one? 4 months of complete love she cheated on me twice which yet again proofs she didn't love me that she only thinks about herself, I was just too blind to see it, since when your in love your really really blind. Love is great I don't hate it and I hope I will fall in love with someone else again because those 4 months were the happiest of my life. They say you don't know true happiness till you have been in love and that you have never been in true pain till you have lost it. I know for a fact that if she truly loved me like she&nbsp;said she did&nbsp;she is going to realize what she has lost, because I know that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm better&nbsp;for&nbsp;her in every&nbsp;way as a person and as a friend. She truly took me for granted and I know she will be thinking about me when she is 23&nbsp;LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Today I woke up with a smile on my face. I know that she might still have a part of my heart but she doesn't have all of it, so I will love again and I will be looking at the stars for another angel to fall down. I might not love that person as much as I loved Stefanie but there are going to have to except that if they love me. I might not   walk   50 mile for them but I might ride a bike 100 miles what I'm saying is that I'll take love a little bit slower next time and I'll savor the love a little better, I'm not going to just rush into things like I did last time. So I'm smiling, why? Because I know I'm still standing even though she completely broke my heart, I'm still here despite how much pain I've been through. I've always said that everyone is here for a&nbsp;purpose for how ever big or small that purpose is. I always try to shine the light in the Darkness sort of speak. I'm already starting to like someone which is a good thing,&nbsp;I'm going to&nbsp;try to ask her out on a date as friend, I'm way to shy to do that LOL but I'll try doesn't ever hurt to try, right? Live life to love and love life to live on and become stronger from your mistakes and wounds. Life is a mystery with endless roads and trails. I'm just going to become stronger from all these experiences. I thank Vero for trying to tell me this but at the time I was in love and I couldn't see 2 feet in front of me. I'm not going to regret not having Stef because I didn't loose her she lost me. I'm so happy and it feels good that she lost and not I, and they say nice guys finish last... HA!   I just wanted to say..  Thank you for everyone who helped me through this. You all are great friends  Sorry I didn't mention my most important friend Alexa she was my shoulder to cry on. I love you  Thank You    Love prevails over all...

      I talk to you every now and then  I never felt so alone again  I stop to think at a wishing well  My thoughts send me on a carousel  Here I am standing on my own  Not a motion from the telephone  I know not a reason why  Solitudes a reason to die  Just you wait and see  As school life is a  It is a woken dream  Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another  I guess its just another  I guess its just another night alone  Now as I walk down the street  I need a job just to sleep in sheets  Buying food every once in a while  But not enough to purchase a smile  A tank of gas is a treasure to me  I know now that nothing is free  I talk to you every now and then  I never felt so alone again  Just you wait and see  As school life is a  It is a woken dream  Aren't you feeling alone?  I guess its just another  I guess its just another  I guess its just another night alone  &nbsp; I love you Stefanie

We went into hot topic and pablos like you should just tell them you don't have a ride I'm like great idea I was thinking of not going anyways since all they fucking do is use me. So I call them up and I'm like I cant find a ride and the manager is like well I get you a ride over here and I quickly say but how am I going to get back so that's that, fuck McDonald LOL. So we went to go see I Robot. I was a bit sad since it reminded me of Stefanie dammit I love her... Movie was awesome highly suggest you go see it. Movie made me think a lot about the world and Stefanie LOL, Pablo saw I was thinking and soon got on the highway. There were bikes doing wheelies on the highway and one of them passed us Pablo got pissed and raced him. He fucking roasted him, trust me when your going 120+mph nothing seems to matter anymore since all your thinking is your about to die at any moment it reminded me of the old times when I used to skate... Stay free...  well I'm out I'm hungry and tired ima go to McDonald and get me something to eat man I'm hungry LOL..... Love you stef maybe she'll hear it LOL.  night folks

      So I love her, I love her so much that's its making me blind  I was talking to my friend yesterday and she is like if she's is telling you she wants to be with you and loves you why isn't she with you now?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It took me a while to register that because I don't want to believe that I'm really going to be alone I don't want to believe that she is not coming back and I'm not going to believe, I love her and even though everyone is telling me to forget her and move on, something inside me tells me she is coming back to me. I know I'm crazy and I know I should just move on but I really do think we're meant to be w/e. Right now I really don't care what people think about me and her I just want to be with her. They told me she's not coming back I don't want to believe this, I don't. I love you Stefanie why am I the only person who understands you? ::sigh:: that quote has been running through my mind all night and day " if she is telling you she wants to be with you and loves you  why isn't she with you now ? ".  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Love is so blind its not even funny, its right there in front of me and I can't even see it  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  "don't ever love anything kiddo, because you'll just end up loosing it"  - Lost in Space   Stefanie&nbsp; I love you  like no other

        so she was 14 when I... She's been dating him for HOW LONG?!??!?!!?  Love: A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.   For whatever I say I want you to know I love you and I want to stay with you  This was writing when I was sad and angry, please don't take any offense  I LOVE YOU  the prettiest people do the ugliest things   Today is Saturday the 10th of July....  We are breaking up, I don't know why. I'm here waiting.. waiting for something to happen, waiting for someone to love, you told me last night you were going to call me from the looks of it it doesn't seem like you are going to call, but I'll be here waiting, waiting for that phone to ring, waiting for that "I love you" to come.  So I'm here, thinking about you like INSANELY CRAZY, I'm crying... ::sigh:: there is nothing I can do now, there's is nothing I can say. I know now that I wasn't meant to love someone, I'm not meant to be loved by someone, I wasn't meant to be with someone.... God hates me.  I'm reading your letters, you were so much in love with me... All of the things you said have now turned into lies. Stef I love you please please don't let this go, don't let me go, I gave you my heart "no take backs" for as long as I live you will always have it. It hurts, the thought of you, with another person while holding my heart, it hurts loosing you, it it... Feels like death.  There is two sides of me, my logical side which believes Teen dating is overrated and completely pointless because there is no way you can keep Two kids in love with each forever, he is more pesstimistic. My other side is hard to explain his the one you know the best the one that wants to be with you forever the one that doesn't listen to the logically thing, the one that sees light at the end of the tunnel.  I don't think I can move on... I'm going to do the illogical thing and pour my heart out to you, but first I'm going to show you how you poured your heart out to me.....        1st letter...  Dear Carlos~  What's up? Nothing much here. I thought I would send you this picture even though it doesn't look like me anymore. Right now you are working and I just finished working out, I love you so much. I really want to meet you as soon as possible, it is driving me crazy. I am nervous about it though. I don't want to lose you ever, you already mean so much to me, I don't know what I would do if I were to lose you so soon. This picture is from October at a friend's b-day party. I hope I see you soon and I love you honey!   Con Amor,  Stefanie     2nd letter...  Carlos  Hey Honey-  What's up? I'm so so bored so I decided to write you a letter. You are at work right now and I'm sitting outside, my dad came him tonight and he is working outside. Four more days and I will hopefully be seeing you, but by the time you get this it will be less than that. I was talking about it with Abigail today and we got really nervous. I hope everything works out between us. It is a huge mess with me, you, and Alexa. I don't Hanna lose you and I don't wanna give you up. I just want to be able to trust you and I want you to trust me. IT IS SO HOT!! OMG! I want to go inside, but then I will have nothing to do. I haven't decided what I am going to do when I first see you, I guess I will see what happens. I hope you will like me with my different hair and all. This was a really random letter, but I felt like writing you. U R SO AWESOME!! (even more than me)  (I know that you know, I just wanted to tell you again) ------------------------------------->  I'm so scared for school, I wander what will happen with this whole bomb threat thing. Anyways... I love you way too much and I'm sorry for putting you through this mess with Alexa. I don't know if you remember, but a while ago I told you about this song that's "I think I fell in love with the 8th world wonder. " well, that's how I feel about you. I love you. I'm out for now. Peace.     P.S. Be mine forever!   If you are wondering why I told you about the song, it is because it was just playing on the radio. Love yah!     3rd letter...   ~Carlos~  I think this explains everything.  I LOVE YOU!  A love like No other    Have you ever loved someone so much it hurts to the point when you can't be away from them. Just to hear their voice you would do anything. They were the only thing you could relate to. They were the only thing you had. The are everything to you. You would give up anything and everything for them. The only way to tell them this was to write it down in away that they could maybe understand how you feel for them. Yout heart swelled for them when they were in pain. A love like no other. They turn your day around when you are sad, make you forget why you waited so long to say I love you to them. Well, I have felt a love like no other. And to lose this would be like my whole world crashing down on me. I need you now, you are the only thing I have and I can prove that to you in anyway. I listen to you, I will do what you want, I adore you, I love you, A love like no other.     4th letter...   Hey Honey-  This is the letter I wrote one day. I want you to have it. I love you so much. Talk to you soon.   My thoughts  Someone onve inspired me to write down what you feel because you never know if others know how you feel, don't take anything for granted. I am still learning to live with what I have in life, things may not be perfect, but at least I'm here. I could look at all the negative things if I wanted to, but I do that too much. Let's take a shot at the positives. I have a loving mom and dad, but sometimes don't understand the damage they can do to the people around them. I have a Grandma and a Grandpa that I know love me and I love them back. I also lost a Grandma and a Grandpa. Grandma was one of my best friends. I have my friends, that care, but sometimes can be questioned. my best friend... Abigail. what is there to say about her? love her to death, she is my bestfriend and she is always there. She won't question if she thinks Iam lying, she won't judge me, I can trust her with anything and she can do the same with me. I am always there for her. Even when we are old and gray. So many jokes we have together. Then there is my boyfriend... I love him, Like no other. my life, my everything. I will do anything for him. If it was up to me, I would spend the rest of my life with him. He makes me feel like no other. My love just over flows for him. My mom lost the love of her life and I don't know how she can deal with it. Is there a feeling more than love? Because if there is I think I feel it for him. I praise my mom for what she went through, or is going through. Have you ever been in so much pain or in such a bad mood that you couldn't stand it, but the second you talk to him or her , yout pain is gone and you are in a world alone with your one and only. And then it is up to you what you do with it, but don't waste it. Everytime I tlak to him he takes my pain away and makes me feel like the luckest girl in the world. Could I ask for anymore? No, I have it all. I love him. So you may ask why I get so upset. I really don't know why. I have my brother and sister who can annoy me sometimes (the brother). I love them both. My sister being my second mom. I have a beautiful niece, who will show any one love. Shes so innocent and you look at her smile and you look at the world from a whole diffrent angle. a more gentle and caring one. I have a good life, with just some indents in some place, but can be fixed. I will move on but maybe just a little bit slower than everyone else. If I wrote about the negatives I would be depressed and upset right now, but I am not, I am relieved and relaxed. I have a different view. I think about my family, friends and the most important to me right now my boyfriend with a smile on my face   P.S. Carlos, I love you and I'm sorry for what I did.     5th letter...  (I'm starting to feel what James most likely felt but about 20 times worse. You just called me and kept saying sorry, I dont understand.... your going somewhere... with someone I dont know. God I love you. I CANT LET YOU GO I'm sorry.. I'm sorry I'm sorry...)   My love a.k.a. my one and only a.k.a. my life a.k.a. my everything a.k.a. my boyfriend a.k.a.my Jesus a.k.a. my world a.k.a.  MY CARLOS!   Hey-  You just left for work and I was talking to you online, while crying. crying because I love you so so much. As I was reading my moms journal, it brought up thoughts of you. I can't put in words how I feel about you. my mom wrote that never take for granted the other person knows your feelings so write it down. I don't want you to think that I am saying I love you because I feel like it or I just wanted a boyfriend. I have never felt like this in my life and I mean it when I say that. I have felt feelings like this, bit so incredibly strong. I want you to be mines forever and ever. I want to think that you will be and I hope you are. Everytime I talk to you one the phone I always want to be in yours arms and I always want to kiss you and never let you go, but you are 50 miles away from me. Hopefully, sometime soon we will be close and I well be able to hug you or just be close to you. I don't know if you feel the same as I do, but I love you like no other and I hope that we don't lose eachother. This is probably the most random time to right this letter, but I had to tell you somehow. When I was reading my moms journal I was thinking about how much she loved my dad. He was everything to her ad now she is going through so much pain. I think about losing you and my heart automatically starts swelling. I must really be in love if I cry and write this at the same time. I could wait forever to see you and to have to as mine. I love you and here is that little sticker thing with alexa and I. UR AWESOME!! XOXOXOXOX    so we know now that these words have turned into lies. I will never love again because you have my love. I feel empty now.. with noone no one to talk to no one to be with. if you could understand what I'm going through, you have your friends and family that are going to help you with this and after we're apart you have dave to cuddle with, what do I have? I have no one. I cannot countinue living in a world filled with lies. I cannot countinue walking alone down that lonely path. I can't keep myself together anymore. You were all I ever had, please understand that this is that only way out, I cannot bare with this pain alone. Death cannot feel anyworse than what it feels now... Normally in the old I would have my hate and anger for the world to get through this, but I dont have does anymore thanks to you, you have made me a better person when I was with you. Please understand when I say this is for the best, dont be selfish and put yourself in this you will not be hurt as much as I ever was.  I'm sorry you ran into me, and I'm sorry for all the pain that I caused you.   I love you Stefanie I would do anything for you. Above are all the letters you sent me with all the typos and everything, these letters have made me cry so much in this weekend, I wanna keep the Stefanie from these letters forever and after....  You are the single most Important thing in my entire life, there is no words to explain how much I care about you, how much I want the world for you.  Hmm... what I want is to keep on holding you in my arms, but it is clear to me now that will most likely not have that.  "If you love them let them go" :  if you truly believe this person you are falling for and letting me go, is TRULY going to be there for your goods and your bads then I most let you go, just remember I would do anything for you i've even told you I'm ready to get hurt by you. If this guy can be there when your sad and crying on the phone to him for no reason just because you feel sad and you need someone, and he will be supporting you mentally and actually LISTEN to what you have to say and not just hear the noise of you crying, then I most let you go.  what I'm trying to say is that I love you I would be there for your downs and ups, I would never want you to cry alone, I wanna be rght there with you crying. I DONT WANT THIS GUY TO JUST USE YOU.  I gave you my heart.... please take care of it I have nothing left  I dont want to break up with you, I dont want you to be one of my momeries, I dont want you to get hurt, I want you to be happy thats all I want. I need you stefanie I need you....  thank you for making me feel like Jesus while I was with you keep me save in your memories I love you, you will always be the girl of my dreams.  as an Otaku I have the respondability of  I'm sorry  please forgive me  believe if you could.....   I saw a field  that grew  Perfection  Full of things you do...    KLogX

      i really do think life wants me to kill myself. everything i ever believed is becoming false, everyone who i know is going crazy, work sucks dick. My ex-girlfriend fucking hates me she doesnt even wanna see my face or hear my voice, God i love her, this is the worse month of my entire life, im waiting for someone to kill me. No one cares it seems no hears me screaming no one hears me crying. It doesnt stop hurting no one sees me hurting they're all selfish i need to escape i which i had her i love her so much, everything is wrong nothing is right, everything is wrong nothing is right.   FUCK IT
