I'm going to go screaming into the night now, so please post, so that I don't have to babble on like this again!!!!   Au Revoir

      Wow, I just remembered what my nightmare was about!! Someone let Dianna from school post on our blog!! I don't know what my sub-concious was thinking to make me have a dream like that, but it was terrifying!! And all she posted about was how cool she was and how obsessed with Nate Bjur she was!!! Wow, I'm scarying myself all over again!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh........   Au Revoir

Oh well, what is really sad is that all she talked about was Nicholas! She's more obsessed than we ever thought!!! Ooooo, and Abby's coming soooooon!!!!   Au Revoir

      I think it's broken, though. So sad.  I remember the day I got it. 5/7 of my family was on vacation and we were staying in a hotel in this little hickish town called Mariposa. My parents and sister went for a walk around town and looked at the little shops and when they came back they brought many treasures back with them - one being my preciousss and another being the location of a store that sold Drumsticks. Yum. Oh, right. Getting off topic... my parents had wanted to buy me this ring cause of the Relient K song. I had put it on one of the many tapes I had made for the trip and they loved it. So, when they saw the mood ring sitting on the shop counter, they thought of me. How grand is that? When they saw a symbol of moodiness, they thought of me =P   I forget my point for sharing this delightful tale but hey, it's summer and it's not like I've got anything better to do that share pointless stories. Thank you and good day.

      Its seems odd that the smplest thing in the world could be the most tasty. Sticky rice is like my all time favorite food. (that and lemon grass soup!)  I had it on monday night and it was reaaaallllllly good!  Yum yum! I could eat it all day!

      I got my braces on today. I look like a cross between a rabies infested rabiit and a dog. Its great! Haha. Good thing its summer so no one will have to see me. Except for all the church people. But they don't matter.  I decided to get the clear braces and from far away you cant even tell I have braces. But then if your, at most, 3 feet away you can totally see them. Oh well.  I can't wiat till I get them off. I h ave two years. I decided I am going to do EVERYTHING they tell me. I am sure everyone says that but then stops doing it after they have had their braces for awhile. But, I am gonna do it!  I will update you on how it goes. :)

      I wrote this poem in December when I was pretty depressed. It doens't have a name, but thats ok!  Every step I take I fall back three  I never get it right I guess it wasn’t meant to be  I wanna be like you I wanna serve you  But I feel I can’t Its just so hard.  I try I get up again  But then I fall Fall back down.   Theres nothing good in me Its all you.  This life this heart I give it up  Please, do somethign good with it   I am stuck in this whirl wind  Or should I call it  atronado.  It never stops. It just keeps swirling around  round and round   I’m ina prison without bars I can’t escape  I try but the force is to strong  I want to be loved I wanna be held

Friday, i didn't do anything noteable Thursday, nothing Wednesday, it was my real birthday and i got to go shopping in portland all day with Laura and then we went to eat at red robin... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  i can't think of anything to say, i'm really tired though.

      ok, here we go, the longest post as of yet *i hope*. hold on, i have to go to the bathroom. ok, i'm back! here it is: my trip to Canada...  Friday: woke up early got to the church at 6 o'clock in the morning!!! hung around until 7, got in the car and didn't actually leave until around 7:15. drove for about 5-6 hours getting to Mt. Vernon an hour late because of all our bathroom breaks (we had 40 people, so sue us). we stopped in Mt.Vernon to eat lunch, leaving again in about an hour. once we got across the border, we stopped at a bank to exchange our money that took about an hour because people didn't know what they were doing or they were going to the bathroom or they were playing HACKEY SACK!! our youthgroup is kind of... special. we drove about another 6 hours, arriving at our host home at about 7 o'clock. then we finally got to the church a little bit after it started at 7:20. we worshipped and listened to a speaker until about 11:30 then, we went home and to bed.   Saturday: we awoke at about 7 (that number just keeps popping up, doesn't it?) and ate breakfast and gathered our stuff to head to the rec center. you see, they couldn't accomodate 40 people in their showers so we had to use the rec center. we got there around 8:40 and found out that it didn't open until 9. so we just hung around in the rain for 20 minutes then the people who didn't need showers went to the normal bathroom to get changed and ready because it cost a dollar just to get into the shower room! grrr... then, we rushed over to the church and grabbed the front of the church. people kept glaring at us because we took up so much room. we listened to worship and a speaker and then went to two of three workshops that we would be attending that day. I went to transforming your school because Jenessa did. and then I went to radical relationships for girls. After that, we went to go eat lunch. we went to the mall, which turned out to be a big mistake because my leader wanted to get back pretty quickly and it was pretty packed! after we finally got our food, there was still the matter of finding a table in there. yeah, it was interesting... so after that we went back and found our third workshops, i went to one about missions trips it was pretty good, just people telling us their stories about traveling to places like India and Thailand. it was pretty sweet. then, we just had about 4 hours to hang out. we went to the mall to go shopping. it was me, jenessa, jeanie (my leader), kara (my youthpaster's wife), liz (another leader), and katrena. it was really fun, i got this really cool headband and some boys are smelly lip jelly.  jeanie and i went straight back to the church because we weren't really hungry and the two people tried to save spots for all 40. then, we heard the another speaker and then we had worship with crazy intercessory prayer going on. then, we went home and went to bed.   Sunday: we got up at about 8:40 and went back to the showers, i was going to take a shower, so i payed the dollar and then when i got there there was like a 20 minute wait because the stupid place only had like 4 showers in it. ugh! so i just washed my hair in the sink and katrena french-braided it. then, i basically hung around for an hour while everyone fryed their hair and put make-up on. Kara tried to straighten Hannah's hair, and yeah.. it didn't work too well. we went over to the church and had service, it was ok. i don't really like church sevices too much. it was cool though, they had this guy come and do a rap, it was funny! i guess God had healed a bunch of people through him too, so he had some good stories. the guy talked about how there was seven mountains of the world and if you ruled the mountains you ruled the masses. and then there was an eighth mountain above all the rest and that was God, but the seven mountains were things like spirituality, family, political, arts, media, and two other things i can't think of right now. then we had free time basically until 7:15 because we didn't want to hear the music so kara, jeanie, stacy, caitlin, and i went out to eat at wendy's and then to our host's home to watch a movie. we ended up watching Girls Just Want to Have Fun, it was such an 80's movie! very good!! Kara finished straightening hannah's hair and it looked pretty good. and then she did my hair in curls. we went back to the church and had the best night of intercession we had the entire weekend, then we went to bed.   Monday: woke up, packed, went to church. had the last session of the conference. We had lunch out of a grocery store (i had some chinese food and root beer) and then we were on our way home!! everything was going great and then we hit the highway. OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! we moved 10 miles in 4 hours--literally! that was exasperating! but we got to get out of the car and just walk around on the highway twice!! woo-hoo, the second time we got out because ricky and stephen and peter were jumping down this cliff and it was really funny!! then, once we finally got out of that mess it was all because of a little bump in the road and they had the nerve to hold up a sign that said, "slow". so we got out of Canada four hours late and didn't end up eating dinner until 11 o'clock. and that just happens to be when burger king's drive through closes. so they were very exasperated and we were the last car but we weren't really so we squeezed four more people into our car! hahaha. and then, when we got our food. i was in the front seat, half on Jenessa, half on the seat with the money in my hands trying to distribute it, also holding on to my nuggets and fries because the backseat people weren't helping at all and jenessa had her hands full too. and Audrey just kept giving me drinks because the lady was just like shoving them at her and so she didn't know what to do with them because the back seat were all oblivious so then jenessa goes, sara can you grab my fries and i accidently drop my fries all over the car!!! aaahhhhh!! so i just went bbbbbbbblllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh. and said, that's it! one of these days i'm just going to freak out and shoot all the fast food people!! and Audrey thought that was really funny, so she's all laughing and i'm just trying to pick up my fries and yeah... it was sad. then we sat in the parking lot and ate for about 15 minutes, half an hour. so when we finally got on the road again it was about midnight.   Tuesday: then me and jenessa were really hyper! so we danced around to the party song, basically screaming the words until we had heard that song about 5 times. then we put in the Postal Service and fell asleep to their soothing melodies, they are the band that wrote my new favorite song. it's a good song to ponder to.  if that made any sense whatsoever. so, then we stopped twice or thrice more, i think twice for gas and bathrooms and once in woodland to drop of jenessa, zynulda (sp?), amber, and bobby. we got to the church around 5 in the morning once everyone got situated, our car got semi cleared up of all the crap the jr. high boys had left in it, and we got one too many people in our car we set out and didn't get home until about 6 because we had to drop off 5 people. so then we came home and talked for a bit with my parents. I found out that josh has a new girlfriend (sarcasticly) who lives in Canada and who he wants to marry. her name is Danae.   ok, i'm finished. my birthday is tomorrow and i am about ready to pass out.   oh yeah! my upstairs computer is broken, i'm on my dad's computer so if i don't blog for a while, that's why...

      in case you were all wondering that was a grumble that comes when you have just woken up or feel like you have just woken up.  i woke up about an hour and ten minutes ago because my sister scared me.  i was asleep and i kind of heard her say my name, but you know when you are sleeping, it kind of get's incorperated (sp?) into your dream... so i didn't pay any attention and just kept right on sleeping... but then i rolled over and i ran into her. and ok, so you're thinking what's so scary about that, right? well, my dream had a boy in it (no, i will not say which boy) and so i rolled over and there was someone in my bed, i almost screamed. it was so scary!!!   did i already talk about the dance? well, if i did, sorry, i just woke up and i'm losing my mind. if not, here we go! as dances go, it was pretty fun, i think we had a record number of boys there! a whole 5 or 6 of them! haaha, our school is so retarded! in case only having 5 boys from the entire freshman class show up wasn't enough to persuade you of how stupid our school is, we had a smoke machine that set the fire alarm off! the fire truck came and everything! it was funny though, cuz we didn't know what to do, so we just stood there with the fire alarm going off, it was pretty great! and then, when we finally got outside, everybody started playing soccer, i didn't though because none of my people i was hanging out with play soccer. hmmm... need to work on that. let's see, Johanna and Katie danced with Nick, Caitlin danced with Josh, and everybody else just kind of danced in a Cliquey sort of cirle... haha, we discovered just how much of a clique we truly are.  all in all, it was a very interesting night, i got three hours of pe hours though! yay!  today, i havn't really done anything so far, but i am going to soccer practice later on and then i may go hang out with my small group, but i may not, what are you doing Jenessa? i need to know!

      so, yesterday i wasn't on all day because i had a very busy day!! (this is the part where i explain what i'm talking about...)  i went to school, and it was, well, it was school. and lately school hasn't been very good or bad, i just kind of go because i have to and if i happen to have some interesting conversations or something of the sort, so be it.  but, yeah, that sounded cooler in my head. hmmmm... need to work on that.  then, i came home and i felt sick so i just rested and read (i'm reading  The Catcher in the Rye  by J.D. Salinger, it is excellent, i highly recommend it!)until Heather came over.  Heather came over and we made our poster for English, and ok, this poster is the best one i've ever had a part in!! although our mousetrap car poster was pretty good also... anyways! this poster, is four posterboards randomly stuck together with the timeline going in a spiral circle and ending with our best picture and the title with pictures and subtitles all around it, it's wonderful!! and it's about as big as i am! yay!! haha  then, heather left and i ate dinner, is was some yummy mexican crap... mmmmm  i had to go baby-sit at church for a small group leaders meeting and my youth pastor's hard core band was playing so all the little 4-year-olds wanted to go listen to the music but there was all these scary people hanging around so, yeah... it was creepy.  and right when i came home to blog about it all, joshie comes running in and says, "Sara, call Whitney's house." (Whitney is our neighbor, hannah's friend) so i called her house and i had to go baby-sit because their friends were having a baby and for some reason they were going, i needed money, so i was like, ok.  i went over there and they didn't come home until 6:30 this morning!! and i only got $20!! grrr... ok, i know i'm just sleeping, but it IS  a big inconvienience to me to have to sleep there on a school night, whatever though... so i was super tired all day long!! ugh! and i swear i'm losing my mind...  i have crap i need to go do... i'll be back!!

      ok, so i'm officially falling apart... i will explain more later, it's easier to go chronologically...   yesterday, i went to school... it was pretty ok, i think... no wait, that was thursday i was really hyper, never mind... yesterday school was well, school... not really good or bad, just something you have to endure. then LoriAnn went home with me and we went to Fred Meyer's to get posterboard and pixy sticks. and then we went to Marianne's house, it was fun... i stayed up until about 8 or 8:30 and then i fell asleep watching "Back to the Future", when i woke up, "Shrek" was on... so then i had to go to soccer, only i read my stinky email wrong and got there an hour early, and my mom wasn't even there!!! LoriAnn's mom dropped me off, so i went over to Lewisville to see if we were over there and on the way i called my mom, i was WAY off... *sigh* so i watched Evergreen play Camas, and Camas actually scored a couple, which was sad because we couldn't score against Evergreen and we beat Camas pretty bad... hmmmmmmmm.. and then i figured out at half time that the refs were Katie Salvey and Courtney and Colleen Derry. so i talked to them for a little bit, that was nice.   at 12:30 i walked back over to where my game was and sat for a while... then, people started showing up. and finally my mommy got there with some food.  ugh! then i had to play two games with teams that just sit there and shove you and i had stayed up all night (my own fault) and i'm really out of shape, and a couple other things that i don't think i need to go into detail about. anyways, it pretty much sucked! we lost the first game and the second but the second was lost in a shootout and we should have won the first game, we were the better team... maybe we did, i don't know.    so now, i'm sitting here on my computer, whining to all of you guys, hurting, needing sleep, needing food... *waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

      and move on until today. the reason i have not been posting is because our internet is broken upstairs and i do not get to go on this computer very much...   On Sunday, I woke up and me, joel, and josh went off to church and Jenessa was not there!! (where were you??) Then, josh went over to Ricky's and Joel took me to Fred Meyer's because i needed batteries. when we got home i went up to my room and read for a bit. (i am reading the best book. it's called  Sarah-Women of Genesis   and it is written by my favorite author of all time, Orson Scott Card. It is super good) anyways!!! Then, my parents and Hannah came home and we just hung around... then, we ate really good dinner for father's day and Ricky and Sierra came over (their names are now Richard and Previa because my dad is just so special!!) *rolls her eyes*  Then, we went to our soccer gameS. and Laura was there!! we lost our first game like 8-2 or something because everybody (especially me...) then, we went over to play our other game and i think we tied that one 6-6 and that team was kind of scary because there were all these huge guys that would just run into you. the first team was only scary because there was this kid who looked like Ben and it was just weird, but i stole the ball from him and josh scored! oh! that's the other thing!! josh was being really nice at our games and kept giving me high fives and stuff, it was sweet! then, i watched a really retarded movie called Open Range with Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall in it. and it was funny because there was this kid in it named Button and i was like, "i wish my name was button... or peekaboo" (joel in the backround) "peekaboo??? and i was like yeah!! and my mom goes, we can call you peeka-button!! so, that is my new name!! haha  On to Monday, i woke up and did NOTHING ALL DAY except when i got to go to Laura's at 5:00 and i have been giving the job of post all of our special sayings and i will do that, but at the end of my post, so if i forget, just remind me. oh, and my pictures are all upstairs so i cannot post any of my pictures yet... sorry.  anyways. i got there and me and Laura were just hanging out in her room until everybody else got there and then we went down to the creek and emily talked about fishing with cheese! and then we went and talked about stuff while laura pushed me and emily in the hammock and heather and johanna sat on the ground. then, dinner was ready!! it was so yummy! we had teriaki chicken, sticky rice, potstickers, and watermelon!!! yay! then, we went inside and watched Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck in it. it was ok.. mostly we were talking to much to pay attention to it. then, we went up to laura's parent's room and watched ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES!! it was soo good! haha. during the two movies we ate so much cream puffs, fat boys, and jelly bellys!! it was sooo good! and i, surprisingly, did not get sick. and while we were watching the tomatoe movie, josh and (it was ian, laura) brought my medicine and camera!!! so i had my baby with me!! so then we went out to the tent and hung out for a bit. until we decided to go look at stars. so, we were laying there. and all of a sudden, heather goes, "LET'S GO ROLL DOWN A HILL" (i realize i used the contraction let's but it is a quote, so sue me) so, we went and rolled down laura's terrific rolling hill! and every single time i went heather would run into me. then, we went back and decided to sleep outside. and i did not want to be on the end so i kept jumping between heather and emily, but they cheated and tickled me!! so i went between emily and laura and heather had to be on the outside anyways!! haha. then, we slept. but, not before i saw a shooting star!! yay! when i first woke up, it was like 4:30, so i went back to sleep and i woke up and fell back asleep like 4 more times. one of those times was around 5 and i looked up and there were all these bats circling overhead, it was sooo cool looking!!   Tuesday (i know i already made it to five, but we will just forget about that right now..) so, we went inside and had breakfast, laura has the best cereals! i ate cinnamon life and honey grahme ohs! yummy! then, Johanna had to go home, it was very sad!!!!! then, at 10:30, we went to Laura's grandparent's condo and played tennis. laura and heather beat me and emily twice! but the second game we did better... then, we decided to go swimming, but emily could not find her traje de bano, so she had to just stick her feet in the hot tub, poor emily!! heather taught me how to do a synchronized swimming handstand and then, we raced once and then we played marco polo. i got laura, she got heather, and heather got me. i ran out of breath when heather was it... because i kept going under water! then, we went in the hot tub, it was great!! then, we ate and went home and my mom came to get me.. :'(  when, i got home i played the Sims for about 3 hours, my person is doing so good! (and i did not cheat!!) then, i read for 15 minutes and went to play soccer for an old ladies team that my mom used to play for. i did not do very well, and we lost 6-5.   Then, today all i did was wake up, go to soccer, and come home and go on the computer.   Here are the sleep over sayings that i can remember *correct me if i am wrong*  "Anybody want a creamsicle??" "LET'S GO ROLL DOWN A HILL!" and i cannot, for the life of me, remember any more!!! help!! post them in my shoutbox or something!!

Joel and Josh will be home later tonight, BUT they are leaving right after they get here to go to a party and probably will not be home till really late and mom, dad, and hannah are not coming home until tomorrow! yay!! :D I may go to Christina's graduation party, if Joel and Josh decide to go to that, but i think they are thinking of going to Alana's party instead, tell me what i should do! i could probably get a ride, but would it be weird for just me to go? what do you guys think?

      today was a very interesting and fulfilling day... or NOT! whatever though, it is summer, and i did what you are supposed to do in the summer. i just relaxed all day! it was glorious, i did not do anything i did not have to do. i love that!   so first i had to get up at 7:30 in the morning to go to the doctor's (ok, forget that whole thing about doing whatever i wanted the whole day; but the whole rest of the day was great!) anyways, i got some new allergy medicine that will hopefully WORK! and some nose spray (in case it is a flop like Claritin) and my last and final shot for a long while!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (i can only hope...)  then, i came home and i read all day long! like, seriously from 9 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon. in fact, i started (and finished) The Princess Bride by William Goldman. It is SUCH a terrifically wonderful book! oh, how i love it. but then i realized, all of the other books on my reading list are not ones that we own. so, (being the calm-headed person i am) i run downstairs shreiking (boy, does my family have special summers...) "ATTENTION ALL DRIVERS!!!!!!! I have run out of books and i NEED to go to the library, NOW!! (i had also run out of space on those cheesy reading logs they give you at the library-hey, free movies, whose going to pass that up? not me...) but, alas! my dad was working, my mom has to finish her quilt by next SATURDAY, Joel was working (he found a job!!), and Josh is a pig. so i ran into my room and cried, no reason just the normal hormones of a 15 year old      at a special time of the month. and so my mom, being the beautifully sweet person she is, said we could go in an hour if i wanted. SsOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo one hour later i was one my way to the library singing the songs on my cd heather made me. when all of a sudden, we were there! i love the library!! i really do, i do not know how on earth i scored as low as i did on the geek test, maybe i am more a nerd than a geek, i have heard there are differences. ;) so i went in and THEIR STUPID COMPUTERS WERE ALL BROKEN!!! so i found one of the books on my list and could not for the life of me find the other 6!! so now i am going to have to go back before Saturday because i am going to be gone for a month and three books is not going to be enough for a month!! then, i came home and read some more until i got tired of that.  Then, i went on the computer for a very short time, until i got hungry. i went downstairs and watched tv until Hannah got so mad at me she said i didn't deserve anything and she freaked out, so i went upstairs and hung out for a little while until the rest of my family came home so i could defend myself against her better. Then, i decided to come on here, so here i am... and that is a normal summer day in my life. tomorrow i am going to be home alone all day long!! so if anyone of you is bored by all means call me!!

      well, today was the last day of school. i was sort of happy and then a little sad too... hmmm. it was really fun though! i will tell about the fun parts and then later the bad parts!  HAPPINESS!! (these are all of the happy things that pop into my head randomly as i think about the day)    great friends   yummy food   ICE CREAM!!   pictures   our "yearbooks"   swings   how we couldn't go to the bathroom because people kept stopping us and making us sign their yearbooks.    everybody was nice to everybody else, regardless if they liked them or not, i love it when that happens! :)  Sadness...    People are leaving   Heather didn't sign my "yearbook"   everybody is leaving!!!   i had to wake up early  ok, i am done with that.  haha, i am going to explain scaring the twins because it is pretty funny.   well, first of all, it was lunch time and me, laura, and emily were walking around and the only place we could see by people we knew was right by Marc (i think) and so i just went over and sat by him, and yeah, he looked kind of nervous. and then i looked over, and there is a completely empty table right across from us, but i had already started eating, so i just stayed there. and they just got up and left like half way through.  and then later, they were playing catch with a football, but it looked like they were playing 500 so me, caitlin, and laura went over to play with them and we just kind of took over the game. so, yeah they probably thought we were stocking them. but we weren't!!  Attention all you CAMmers who read this! we are going to go get our yearbooks at 11:00. be there, or be square!

      Today was the Ape Caves and i have to admit, it was pretty fun. but only because we made it fun!!! here was our itenerary:  we got to school and hung around until about 8:10 and then we got on the froshy bus!! (haha, i cannot believe i just said froshy, i      that word, it is almost as bad as when everybody wrote HAGS in our yearbook last year... give me a break!) so then, we drove for like 45 minutes and got to the ape caves. that was ok we just walked around in this pitch dark cave for an hour and we lost laura and emily!!! waaaaaaaaa. but emily told taylor she ate meat and i missed it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dang! then we just sat on the bus the rest of the day because we didn't want to get off and heather (poor fool) gave me complete control of her camera and i took all of her pictures in about 10 minutes *woops* it was fun though. you should have been there ;)

      haha, wow, i am a loser!!!!  i just really love weekends is all. so, here's what i did with mine  Friday: i went to school, did really bad on my History final, but i think i got 106% on my math and 100% on my spanish finals. so that is nice. Then, after school i went to Karsen's house and we went grocery shopping-i always feel so bad for the people who have to witness me being a hyper teenage     ... then, we went back to Karsen's house and hung out. we made a movie! it was great! It was called the Duct tape Retard and yeah.. it was me because Karsen is a better photographer! it is super good though!! then, we watched Win a Date with Tad Hamilton and yeah.. it was pretty stupid. oh well! so, we went to bed at around 11:30, but we did not go to sleep until about 1:30 or 2!   On Saturday we woke up, and ate some breakfast-mango and cocoa pebbles. then, we hopped on the four-wheeler to drive down the drive way to meet my parents. i got dressed in the car and raced off to my last two soccer games of the season. We played Hockinson the first game and beat them by about 7 points-a shutout. Joel had to ref because no one showed up and he was really bad at it, it was pretty funny! then, we played Heritage and tied 2-2?? we might have won, but i cannot shoot worth beans!!! we went home and i had some allergy medicine because i had forgotten to take it to Karsen's and it turned out to be drowsy medicine, so i fell asleep watching Amelie and woke up and Daniel was there. so i went up to bed and slept until dinner. we had hamburguesas and then we watched the Hours!! it is such a good movie!! but it is very depressing, so don't watch it if you are in a bad mood.   Today i woke up in a fairly good mood and went to church. then, after church i went to Izzy's with the Jr. High class-since i'm in jr. high, you know ;).  so i ate until i was full and then i ate some more-it really is amazing how i'm not fat, considering how much food i eat when i get the chance! then i came home and got on here. tonight i have a soccer game and laura is going to come!! it will be fun!

      i dislike america with the fire of a thousand suns, we are so stupid! i have decided not to use contrations anymore, just so you all know...   i really need school to end. if i have to go back there tomorrow (which i will) i am going to flip out. those finals had better be easy or i am going to drop from A's to C's (or whatever grade will come to me if i flunk the finals). i do not think i can take it anymore, i strongly dislike school. i simply dislike it with a fiery passion. luckily tomorrow is my last day of actual work! in case i don't get a chance to blog for a while here is my itenerary for the next while.  Tomorrow: school, KARSEN'S HOUSE!!!!! Saturday: soccer-2 games of it-that's it, call me. Sunday: Church-going to izzy's for jr. high graduation *because i'm a jr. higher you know *wink*-, hang out-call me!, soccer game-laura!! call me!!

      My inspirational post, but just remember I wrote all of this at one in the morning... So, it may sound like I'm on part of the time, but I wasn't. (also keep in mind, that I don't watch the news and crap like that...)  Political-this is basically who I would vote for and why and then I just kind of ramble apologies for a while.  I think that if I were of voting age, I would vote for Bush. There are a few reasons for this. First of all, I believe that he is a Christian and that is very important to me because it means that he will be more likely to listen to God then someone who isn't would be. Secondly, I don't agree with Bush on everything, but I agree with him more often than I agree with Kerry. Third, I just don't like Kerry very much. Fourth, I listen a lot to what people say and my parents are very much for Bush, along with many of their friends, Taylor, and Emily. Sadly, I think the last reason is my main one. I don't know much about either president's campaign; only that when I hear them on TV or wherever, I agree with Bush more than Kerry. I also think that it's very scary how charismatic Kerry, Edwards, and Clinton are. And how persuasive a speaker Clinton is. I'm very much against Clinton, and usually very much out job the room whenever anything political is on TV. But, I found myself sitting there, actually listening to all these ancient democrats talk about how to rid America of president Bush. My opinion may seem biased to those with loved ones fighting in Iraq because I don't know anybody in the army/marines/et cetera... And I'm sort of out of touch with reality. I never watch the news, we don't get a newspaper, the only way I find out about things is by listening to friends and family talk. I'm very self-centered: if it doesn't concern me or someone I love, I will most likely forget about it. That's sort of what happened with the war. I kept forgetting we were in the middle of one. I don't know anyone half-way across the world, dying for our country; so I tend not to care. I'm sorry for any of you who do.  Religious-this is mostly just my testimony, well, kind of...  I am a non-denomination Christian, and I have been all of my life. I go to Vineyard Christian Fellowship (they're everywhere, go find one) and I love it! Well, as much as I have liked any church. I like the worship, I don't mind sitting and listening to the pastor preach, and the people are great. But, in the past year or so, I have been having a ton of questions about my faith. And for a while, I just stopped going to church. I d it! They stopped the highschool class because people were just going to get out of the sermon (how ironic!). I didn't feel the worship-I felt stupid, just standing there for 45 minutes. I d the sermon because I wouldn't pay attention so, it just seemed boring and stupid. And I didn't have anyone to sit by because Joel was at school and Jenessa was still in Jr. High (they still have Sunday school). I didn't really like praying... I don't like reading the bible-I was a wreck. This went on from probably January until July. In June I went on vacation where the only church I got for almost a month was my friend's church and youth group-once each (both at a vineyard in Columbus). Anyways, when I got back, I was totally into it! The worships great, the sermon was funny, I sat in between Joel and jenessa (she's in high school now), I still don't remember to pray as much as I should, and I haven't read the bible in a while, but I care more, and I like it a lot better than I used too.  So there you go, not as good as I would have liked, but it will do.

      always prove to be quite entertaining... Tonight we watched the Triplets of Belleville.  a very interesting cartoon with about 5 lines in it. The only bad thing about it was a half-naked cartoon, other than that, it's completely clean! I really like french movies... well, ok, the only other one i can think of is Amelie, but both were very good. Amelie is not family friendly though, if you know what i mean! I have not had a meaningful post in a while and i'm bored and don't want to go to bed, so here you go... I think i shall talk about politics, religion, and whatever else pops into my mind, i'll come back in a bit; or i'll post tomorrow. i'm going to write it down somewhere else first.

       no, seriously, i have! last night, i was on the computer until what i thought was midnight thirty. i can even remember looking at a clock/watch and thinking, ok it's 12:30, i should probably go to bed.  so, i went into my room and did stuff for what seemed like 20 minutes, but when i looked at my clock right before i went to sleep it said 3 o'clock! so, i have no idea. then, this morning i woke up and looked at my clock and it said 9 something. and i can't remember falling asleep, but then when i got out of bed my clock said 12 something!! what is going on??? i don't know... whatever. i thought you would all like to know that.  guess what ya'll?????????       I START DRIVER'S ED ON MONDAY!!!!!!!!! i am sooo excited! haha, the name of the place is Quality Driving School, so it's probably really awful! whatever though, i get my permit...       last night me and joel watched Hellboy. i didn't like it very much, it's sort of evil and really fake. awful, in other words...       out of interesting things to talk about.    currently listening to   Spiderwebs- No Doubt

       Lately, I have actually been thinking about the world around me. This is a big thing for me, to actually think about something besides ME...&nbsp; Mostly political stuff, but other things too. And I think a big part of it was because of all my friends' blogs. Like, Heather and Taylor were both talking about the movie, "Fahrenheit 9/11". But, the funny thing was, they had completely different views on it. Heather was talking about how it opened her eyes to a lot of things and how factual it was. But then, Taylor's was all about how full of lies it was. I don't mean that he was just openly lying, but like facts put together so that they're not completely truthful. And even though I don't want to take sides and I haven't even seen the movie I was more inclined to agree with Taylor, for a couple of reasons... For one, she had a lot more things to say on the matter. For another, I was already thinking about voting for bush (if I was of legal age). And because Michael Moore's last movie (Bowling for Columbine), while very good and informative, it was basically a movie attacking the leader of the national rifle association, with a couple other things added in.&nbsp;   This leads me to a question, if you guys&nbsp;were of voting age, who would you vote for and why? I would really like to know and if you would just post a comment, that would be great, it could be anonymous if you would prefer.   Just a few minutes ago, I was reading lair's blog and she was talking about mormon's and how she couldn't understand how false their religion is. But, that brings up the question that I have been dealing with for a really long time now: Whose to say what's right and what's wrong? I mean really, don't you think that some Mormon (not to be used indiscriminately) is talking to a friend, saying how they can't understand how false Christianity is? Whose to say which is true and which isn't? Of course, when I asked my mom this question she told me, God is. But that's my point, whose to say which god is real? What if we're all living a lie? Nobody knows, except those who have already died. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a Christian, trying to be a better one everyday. I still have troubles with my faith though and this is my worst question, it's always bugging me. What if this is all made up? Just something to think about, I'm going to bed now. It's 12:40. Good-night.     Currently listening to   Nice to Know You- Incubus

       ... i'm going to Wal-mart, i don't even really want to, i'd much rather go to Freddy's, but i have a gift card at Wal-mart. so there you go. i'm going to get a tennis racket, because my mom's friend said that they had them on sale for $12! wow.&nbsp; and i'm going to get a planner.&nbsp; i know school's not for a while, but they always start in july and i always feel as though i'm wasting parts of them. i'm probably crazy, oh well!    &nbsp;  Laura, you are so inspiring!&nbsp;I read your blog and i&nbsp;was just like, what have i been doing? &nbsp;I LOVE YOU!!!!     &nbsp;  Last night, i watched Harold and Maude, which is really funny. and it's great because she teaches him how to live. but it has really bad theology and morals, so in that respect, it was kind of... yeah.     &nbsp;  and then Ricky came over and Chelsey and Sierra dyed his hair dark brown! i liked it how it was before!!!! (i thought you'd want to know jenessa. oh! and i still have your bunny!)    &nbsp;  i'm already out of things to say, but i did just wake up like, 1/2 hour ago... that's my excuse.    &nbsp;  currently listening to   Yellow- Coldplay

       Just kidding, i didn't score. we won anyways though, 9-7. i played awful, but i had an asist. just a corner kick though. i could've scored, but i choked and took one too many touches, half way through the touch i realized what i had done, crap. that's what i played like, crap. oh well, 'twas fun, i suppose. though it got quite scary when the other team got mad at a ref's bad call and we scored (the asist). and then they got really aggressive because they wanted to score, i it when that happens, it's really scary! and Joel hurt his knee again, no apparent reason, except that it was already hurt and he kept playing on it anyways...&nbsp;but now i'm just rambling on, so i shall stop and bid you adieu (i think that's how you spell it...) oh well.    &nbsp;   currently listening to &nbsp;  These Days- Nico

       i love that song, it makes you take in perspective all the goodness that's still in the world despite all the badness.     &nbsp;  anyways, i had a really good day today!!! i woke up at about 5 till 9 and just sat in bed and thought about things until about 10 after 9. then, i had to get up and get ready for church.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  church was really good too. they played a bunch of my favorite worship songs, so it was easier to get into it. that is a really big thing for me right now, because now is the time when i just have all these questions about god and life and... my faith too. i don't know. and i really liked the sermon, pastor steve is soo funny, you missed out jenessa. and that was important because i havn't wanted to go to church for the past couple of months because it just doesn't seem as fun anymore. so that was really important for me i think.     &nbsp;  then, after church my dad was in a really good mood so he took my mom, joel, and me out to lunch at mcmenamin's on the river front.&nbsp; (Josh went home to take a nap because he was at Ricky's house until 5:30 this morning helping him fold paper's for his paper route and Hannah was at Hillary's) i had bought a doughnut at church though, so i just got a side of spicy chicken wings, which was as big as a meal. but they were tasty.     &nbsp;  When we got home Josh had gone with Chelsea to pick up Hannah and Ricky and Sierra (they're going out jenessa!) were sitting in his room talking. so i went on the computer.     &nbsp;  BUT THEN, Ricky came in and was like, do you want to come to Vancouver Pizza with us?? so, of course i said yes. it was, Josh, Chelsea, Joel, Sierra, Ricky, and me; fun times.&nbsp; the car ride was the best part, as they tend to be and josh was really nice the whole time! it was amazing.     &nbsp;  now I'm just sitting here until it's time to leave for our soccer game (7:30 if any of you want to come) and then i will come home and post about it, if i remember.     &nbsp;  I'm getting better at posting, you have to admit...    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  (Heather i have to copy you with the music thing...)

      sorry, it took a while but Jenessa came over for two nights. and my internet isn't working so i had to use my parents. ugh! ANYWAYS... I will now tell as much about my trip as i can before i go to soccer. but, keep in mind that i cannot tell my whole trip, i'm just going to highlight.   June 26-July 3 (Myrtle Beach, S. Carolina)&nbsp; Wakeman's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best day was when we went to go see Spiderman 2, it is really good!! and the worst day was when i just felt like crap all day on the last day we were there so i just hung out in my room and watched tv. that was&nbsp; a fun week though because the cousin's are all my age or older (except for two little ones-a three-year-old and&nbsp; a one-year-old,they are adorable!!)&nbsp; The ocean was the best there because it was warm and the waves were huge!! The house was three stories, the top two consisting of only bedrooms and bathrooms. i had to share a room with hannah but we got along ok. every bedroom had a tv with cable and there was a huge tv downstairs with a vcr/dvd player, there was also another little one in the rec room. the rec room was cool, it had this video game thing with mrs. pac man, frogger, and some space game. and a pool table. there was&nbsp; a pool and hot tub right outside the door and the ocean was right across the street.   July 3-July 10 (Nag's Head, N. Carolina) Adams'  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week was ok, a little exasperating though. these are all my little cousin's. The house was pink, had a pool right outside and was ocean front. The worst thing was that Hannah and Emily (both 12) kept leaving Allison out (9) and so i had to help settle that which resulted in Hannah getting mad at me. I didn't go into the ocean much because there were lots of jellyfish (Miranda got stung), it was cold, and the waves were no fun anyways.&nbsp; and then, on Wednesday,&nbsp;&nbsp;i got swimmer's ear, so i couldn't swim anyway so i sat in my parent's room and watched tv. (i also finished my book, so don't get mad at me for only watching tv) and heather, you will be happy to hear that i finally saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. it was ok.&nbsp; Then, on Saturday i spent 16 hours (or somewhere close) in the car with my grandparents. Oh yeah, and this was also the week we had to get a dumb family picture and josh pushed me down in the sand when my camera lens was open, so now i have sand in my lens and i had to take my mom's camera to Lauren's house. I had a really fun week that week.   July 10-July 17 (Columbus, Ohio) Lauren's house &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had such a fun time!!!! One of the coolest things was that her dad has a motercycle and i got to ride it!!!! it was soo fun! if any of you ever get the chance, take it.&nbsp; We also went to see the Terminal, very good movie, i really liked it! Then we went to her youth group. THAT was funny. her friend brandon made up this whole story about how this statue of a giraffe was his friend named Charles, it was really weird. On Thursday we went to the mall and i got the most comfortable pants ever at aeropostale!!! i got to see my old house and some old friends. it was soooo fun!!!!!!   July 17-July 20 (Pandora, Ohio) Grandma's house &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This part was sooooo fun!!!! i got to talk to Heather, Laura, and Jenessa on IM and i got to go swimming in Kevin's pool!!!&nbsp; We went and saw King Arthur, soo good, go see it.&nbsp; mostly me and kevin just hung around. i met some of his friends and we played tennis and yeah, that's about it. it was really cool!!!  Joel's girlfriend came with us!! she is sooo cool, i hope they get married, he told me he does too, but he's not sure what the future holds.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)&nbsp;   I'm really tired and i have soccer tonight, so i'm going to go. call me sometime guys!!!!!

       (  say it like a surfer dude) so, anyways, today was very busy! Which is good!      I woke up at 7:50 (after staying up till 3, mind you...) and went to Joel's chiropractor appointment for his knee. After we had been there for almost 3 HOURS we finally got to hightail it out of there. On the the important stuff (me!), we stopped at the camera place in Portland and they said that they will send it in and if Nikon decides that sand in the lens is under warranty, I'll get it back in 3 weeks, free of charge. But, if not, I get a call in 3 weeks telling me how much I have to pay! How awful, eh? So, then, after we sat in traffic for about an hour, trying to get to the DMV, my mom remembers that we probably need my birth certificate, so we go drop Joel off and pick up the certificate. Off to the DMV... I GOT MY PERMIT!!! And I actually had an OK picture, I was sooo happy! Home for a 1/2 hour, then off to Driver's Education-after we had picked up LoriAnn. Answered questions about signs and road markings for two hours, and then home(!), where I ate spinach fettucine and apple sauce. At 7 o'clock, Joel took me driving at Pleasant Valley, it's official, I can't do right turns... oh well! I'll get it eventually. Anyways, I'm running on 5 hours of sleep. Farewell.

       i just watched about 4 hours of tv. because everybody but hannah left and hannah was slowly getting madder and madder at me! so, yeah. i didn't get my permit today because the wait was almost an hour! so, tomorrow I'm going to Portland with Joel and my mom to the chiropracter for Joel's knee, and then to the camera store to see if they can fix my baby, and then, my permit!!! yay! that's all, pace fuori!    currently listening to   Undone (The Sweater Song)- Weezer

       all my troubles seemed so far away! what a beautiful song... anyways, yesterday i didn't blog, so here you go.       Yesterday I woke up at 12:30 and hung around for an hour and a half. then, at 2, we left to go pick up LoriAnn and went to driver's ed. it was ok, but, you know: it was a class. then, i got home, and after joel and my mom got home from joel's physical therapy (for his knee) we ate little caeser's for dinner! and then we had to do listening prayer on whether or not God thinks we should move. it sounds like we're staying here, but i have no idea! it's still kind of up in the air. I hope it all works out soon, i just want to know! then, josh went to Ricky's house (again, it's like Ricky took over Ian's job, he's now our surrogate brother and Ian never comes over anymore... hmm.).  hannah waited for Caitlin to come over (much to my dismay).  so, my dad took Joel and I to go get a movie. we ended up with  Starsky and Hutch  and  The Italian Job . I was the only one who watched them both, resulting in not going to bed until about 1. but then, i got bored, so in reality i stayed up till about 2:30 again... i didn't mean to! it just happens!       today, i woke up at 12:30 again. and my mom is looking at antique shops with Cindi. but, when she gets back, i get to go get my permit!!!!!!!!! watch out world, here i come!

       well, ok, the team was awful and we should have beat them, by like, 5 points (at least). but... WE DIDN'T!!! i played awful, i should've scored about thrice and i kept losing the ball, i didn't play good defense... it was really stupid! but, oh well, at least we didn't lose! that would have been awful! it was just scary because we played a team from the lower division, so they don't know how to play as well (sadly, they're about at my skill level) and so they just kind of flail around. and it's scary so i try to stay away from the scary people, but they're usually my mark and... so yeah, it's not good usually. ANYWAYS, we got home and we watched Michael. i like that movie...  BATTLE!!!!!!!!!!!  then, i took a shower and came on here.        oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  guess what i had for dinner tonight?!?!?!?!?!?!?? BAKED BEANS!!! hahaha! it was great!      well, that's all i'm going to say about that. OOO! except that, i got an Elijah Wyman cd today! Joel burned it for me! he's so cool! none of you have probably (if you have, it's amazing) heard of him, because he doesn't have a record company (but, he has a cd... i didn't get it either, ask joel) and he lives in RI! he's joel's friend, and he has an amazing voice!!       ok, NOW i'm done!

I went to church, Jenessa came over, we hung out! yeah, that's all i did. yesterday ricky, sierra, chelsey, and kandis all came over and they burned cds for like 5 hours! so, that's why i wasn't on the computer last night. tonight i'm going to play soccer, so i will post the outcome when i get back! tootles!    currently listening to   The Boxer- Simon and Garfunkal
