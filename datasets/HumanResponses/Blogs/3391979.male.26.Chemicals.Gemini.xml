      With poetry seeming to rock the boat these days with lesser intellects, I want to scream to the masses of peoples with something they understand.  Thug Music (A.K.A. 'rap music') is a way for me to delve into an audience that most perglitariots believe to be foreshadowing a sonsic end.  Kids wearing their 'hip' clothes that sit below their hips, really seems to be them shouting out in contradiction and begging for my resolve.  So, here it is.    Add an appropriate bass beat.    Oh yeah, fo shizittttttt... [here we go with the go]   Bbbbbrrrrrrrrup from the flow Primordial gosta go Sittin around, bam hammerin Doin their thang With that multi-cellular swang  Can't stop respectin Where we was begattin He holds the key He welcomes me He smiles at me As he toys with me  Trilobite GO HOME!!!!!!   Which yo bad self Gettin on your showin rhyme Cell phones makin him made He not 'jiggy' with the changes of time Ivertro-muscular rage is his diss In your malt liquor he is about to piss   Can't stop respectin Where we was begattin We all came from a cell All I want was some jell He can't stand our smell  Trilobite has GONE HOME!

      With it all together    I glue it apart I come together    I did not my part Totally mad about being... being what?  Just being Balmoral  Whifting songs ascentiutless    I sing proud degrandure If all would just hold me so tight    I would hang onto my past This is not what I am meant for  I bent on it.  I screamed for it.  I lived for it.  Not to die for it. Las Balmoral.  To quote Wan-tu's response     Liuh spen hiech crounghtinz To gather in his wisdom     Crostrich vagnovoch eis shougan  Benting es vantriclar pon douver lik Van Balmoral

      Cool Hat :: plus genre introduction  Turning it on, for all to see.  Basically I have developed a new genre.  It is benevicantly called 'stanatic litter-ocra."  The concept of this genre is to bring about mind blows by cancelling non-invissionative vocabulartry.  Word pictures are not so much what is used by imaginative structures of proceeding proportion.  It is demonstrated in the first work of it's kind, 'Cool Hat'   Mountains walk all a batt,  Style  Brecaption     whipsering, "COOL HAT"  Beat metres  strawberry blat  what was that?  SHOUTING NOW              "cool hat"  Evassive election promised somethings tells of nothing becoming that thing post-awkward nonethings eternal scrapings who got him that hat  say it now  huh  cool "" hat  of coat of such a slat  He-ham, the lion  offers all of that  red mission's dusting  hence of that's one stinking  c o o l  t a

      "Out of the leaching darkness... when did this all go wrong?  I stand and realize the troutness of my mistakes.  All about me, whipsers.  Whispers in the darkness, darkening me.  I can't run - there are scissors in my hand."  Whenever I say that quote, I get chills of enlightenment up my spine.  I am tickled with the thoughts that it brings.  And why shouldn't I be tickled?  This quote IS by far the most stimulating excess of thought that literature has ever encountered.  It spirals all of us into examination of our troust and brings us unto our falts.  Bravo.  Some friends of mine have taken to habbit recanting this quote thrice before sleeping and twice upon awaking.  They have stated that it makes all the difference in their days.  I encourage all people of any intellect (though none would reach that of the author) to ponder this segment of my work.  I feel honoured to be the only person on earth to have the ability to write a quotation such as this one.
