      Oh my god. so, in florida here we have this show that airs on UPN at 1 AM called "Live Prayer" Its where people call in with their problems, complaining to a bullshit pastor, and he prays for them, to the lord. Hes basically homophobic, and he thinks being gay will lead to a very destructive road. So, anyway. My online buddy/friend George, lives in Virginia. I usually talk through voice chat with him, and put the mike up next to the tv too. So, I was letting him listen to live prayer, and he decided next time it was on, hed call in, and say he was gay.  So, anyway, i had the mike right next to the TV, and my computer sound recorder ready, and was watching him on cam. So, he had his phone ready, they said he would be through soon, talking to the pastor. And then all of a sudden i heard on TV "Ok, we have George with us. George, what is your  problem?"   George:" Hi, yeah, im gay" (Or something like that)  And the pastor talked about how to help him stop being gay. But there were some seriously funny moments. The priest dude asked george to turn down his tv (he wasnt watching it on the tv, just listening to it through voice chat), so george was like "ok" And then I swear, there was the longest pause ever. The priest dude was waiting for George to say something, and George was waiting for the priest dude to say something. George was like just sitting there, and the pastor had the most confused look on his face, and was staring at the camera. Finally he went "George, are you there?"   And George said "yeah"  And then he went on, preaching about gays, and it was the funniest thing. I was trying to muffle my laughter because i was afraid theyd hear me through the mike. And I kept seeing George giving huge "silent" laughs. And he even typed "lmao" while talking to him.   Then at the very end of the conversation, he prayed for George. George hung up by the time he was praying for him through :-P  Then like two callers later I think, some dude called in talking about himself and... GEORGE! LMFAO! omg.  So, anyway. I recorded the whole thing. Feel free to IM me on aim if ya want to listen to it :-P :-D  God that was some funny shit.

      Well, more like a journey. I'm going to take my stuffed animal frog with me everywhere I go (including the road-trip my family and I will be going on), so, soon a website will be posted showing all the places hes been to, and what hes done. Today it will be the beach. Hes gonna soak up some rays, but I don't think he'll be going in any water (he doesn't know how to swim yet).   Ok, I better get ready for the beach. Bye.

      I'm sorry, but I don't understand how one could support George Bush, or even the entire Republican party for that matter. My social studies teacher was a republican, and she even said "republicans support big business, while democrats support the people." Then why be republican? Why support a party that is more interested in oil than education? Anyway, back to George Bush..  He is one of the worst presidents we've had - if not the worst. He caused the largest deficit in the history of our country, then when confronted about it, all he said was "well, they're wrong." Very smart Georgey boy. Got any facts to back that up? Sheesh.  Most of the times he cant even form complete sentences, and has the worst grammar ever.  "Rarely is the question asked, is our children learning?"  Is they George? Is they? ;-)  He caused an unnecessary war, that 50 percent of america disagreed with, as well as the United Nations, and even George Bush's own father!!  What the fuck could he possibly be thinking? Is he that desperate for war and power?   I'm also tired of people complaining that both George Bush and John Kerry are bad, and so they're just not  going to vote. Think people, just take the time to use your brains. You know... those things in your skulls there. Which one is the better candidate? Which one is against the war? Which one can form complete sentences?  I also wish people would desist from voting for Nader. Whats the point? Hes supported by 5 percent of america. Obviously he wont win the election. Is he there for an ego boost or what? To me hes a little dipshit who should get his ass out of the race, and try not to screw up the election and bring Bush to power yet again.  And why is it that good presidents get assasinated, and the most terrible live long lives? I mean, come on... Lincoln and Kennedy...  At least Reagan (whom I've never liked)  has gone on to a better place (if you can count the underworld as a better place. I certainly can. We've screwed up the "upper" world :-P )  Ok, I'm done ranting.

       Pedos s/n = flwbound426     Home phone = 770-844-9542   Since its way too much of a hassle spacing everything, this time I won't be posting the conversation. But anyway, I went on my pedo hunting screen name today, and a fellow by the name of  Cary Hamrick, age 19,&nbsp;of the address 7235 Cox Rd in Cummings, Georgia  IMed me today. He said that he would like to fuck me, after repeatedly talking about how I am 14 years old (so he knew how old I was).  He asked me personal questions involving my sexual history, and sexual activities I had done. He said he would like to visit my house to engage in sexual intercourse, and then mentioned that his friend, with the name Michael I believed, would like to come too if&nbsp;I had a friend. I said that I had a friend names Kristie, and thats she was 15. Cary then said his friend would like to fuck Kristie, as long as his friend was lied to about Kristies age, and my age. He told me that Kristie and I would have to lie about our ages to get his friend to come, or else he would not agree to engage in sexual activities because we were so young.  So basically he wanted his friend to unknowingly commit rape, so he wouldn't be alone if he got caught.  I gave him "my address" and he drove down with his friend for an hour and 30 minutes to meet me and fuck me. He told me to call his cell phone when they reached Conyers, the town I said I lived in. I lost the cell phone though.  Eventually I got IMs from Cary, outraged that there was no child for him to rape, and that he drove all that way for nothing. Later I talked with him about the crimes he had commited, and he claimed he didnt commit any crimes. Intent to rape a minor is a crime. Several men have gone to jail for it. He also denied saying much of what he said in the conversation. Lucky for me, I saved it, and proved him wrong.  A very funny part/parts of the conversation, was when he first told me the size of his penis was 9 1/2 inches. Later he told me it was 5 inches. Then he told me it was 7 1/2. Boy, he just cant keep his lies straight.  Anyway, feel free to harass the bag of shit.

      As many of you know, George and I have been doing our own pedopile busts, sort of as an ode to perverted-justice.com. Anyway, today while I was logged on to my normal yahoo screen name on y. messenger, a pedophile within the Sarasota area IMed me. Here is the conversation so far, I'll be back to edit it later when he gets back. Please note, this is not a typical disgusting pedophile, but is indeed, still a pedophile. You'll notice this when he asks me all sorts of person questions, many of which I answered with lies, and the way he deliberately spells words as a little kid would. The pedos yahoo&nbsp;s/n is var3333. His screen name and important things are in bold    var3333 : hello jaded  jaded_thymes: ummm hi   var3333 : hello  jaded_thymes: hi...   var3333 : how you doing  jaded_thymes: fine  jaded_thymes: you?

      Well. Here I am again. Anyway...   You know how they always say the grass is greener on the other side? Soon the grass will all be a disgusting gray color thanks to Bush's fantastic laws that allow pollution. Wahoo. Often times I wonder if George Bush is actually a human being, or just a gorilla wearing an ugly human mask. Much of what he says, I feel, never really makes sense. Hell, anyone who can corrrectly speak English should feel that way too.&nbsp;I'm not sure how he ever became president. Oh, wait, thats right, he cheated ;-). And all the republicans seem fine with that. Mostly because theyve never really cared how they became successful, just so long as they became "successful".  And you know, I'm really not ok with George Bush, a middle aged balding republican man who will never get pregnant, never have the risk of getting pregnant, never understanding what its like to be pregnant, to try to make/take away laws that steal the rights given to pregnant women.&nbsp;   Incase you haven't noticed, I'm pro-choice. But you know, this doesn't mean I'm saying "kill all the fetuses". It means that I support a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with her body. If she is in a terrible position in her life, if she cannot bring a child into this world, if she became pregnant due to rape, or by accident (meaning there was protection, but it didnt work 100%),&nbsp; etc... she should always have the right to choose what she wants to do with her body.   I once saw a car decorated with pro-choice bumper stickers. The one I loved the most was "keep your laws off my body."   John Kerry... ahhh, John Kerry. I love him to death actually. Probably the only politician that I want to give a big ol' hug. You know, that commercial pissed me off. The one that complained that John Kerry voted against the Laci Peterson law which "protects pregnant women from abuse." The reason John Kerry voted against it, was because there was also something addressing the issue of abortion he didn't agree with, which probaby meant it was pro-life, rather than pro-choice. Since Kerry is for a woman's right to choose, then of course he voted against it. You can't toss all this shit into one law. If the Laci Peterson law didn't include anything relating to abortion, then I'm pretty sure he would have voted for it. Sheesh.   Republicans claim that Kerry is too liberal. No. He just changes his opinions. Everyone opinions always change, and for them to point out just one person and call them liberal, is both ignorant and makes republicans seem mentally handicapped. Oh shit, wait, I forgot. They REALLY are.   Anyway, thats enough for now... I didnt bother proof-reading this because I'm going to the beach soon.   &nbsp;

      well. today. i dont know what we're doing. i dont think i have any clothes to wear. well, i do. but i dont want to wear them. i could though but theyre all icky. theyre nice but icky.  today... i dont know what we're doing. i think my sister will be taking me to different places. then tomorrow we're going to georges island. yesterday we didnt go to plimoth.. sp... plantation. we went to the blue hills. i want to go to the omni theater today. i love omni theaters. theyre the only theaters where you could actually trip over someones head in the row below, vomit on 30 rows, or break your neck. :-D so, i should see whats playing there. im willing to see anything that actually moves, or isnt about history. i also want to go to  harvard square. and the orange line and green line and red line.   hmm. so.   on the way up here we stopped in connecticut. i was wearing my shorts, and we were coming back from a restaurant. i asked my mom if my ass cheek was hanging out, and she was talking to my dad at the time. as i ended my question, she made a comment to my dad, not to me, but the whole thing ended up sounding odd.    Me - "is my ass cheek hanging out?"  Her - "i don't know but its in a cheap place"  anyway  yeah, i know, my photo isnt working. i cant fix that until i get home. so...  we're leaving on wedensday. wheeeeeee. busch gardens. i like that place. the lines are huge but i still like it. and the animals are rescue animals i believe. but at the same time it seems wrong to put them in a confined environment. but, at the same time theyre rescued and will be released back into the wild......  hmmmmm  ok

      Well. Hmm.. And todays.  Well, today we didnt do anything really. We went to the bookstore in central square, the blockbuster there too, as well as the harvest co-op where I got a soy shake and a really cool cute hippy talked to me (although he was in his 20s or so. but he was still cool. ive come to the conclusion that i'll marry someone like him when im older. ive decided i wont capitalize anything or use a lot of punctuation because this keyboard is in a plastic bag...) anyway.  My legs have fallen asleep. The computers on the floor. Sam (my sisters boyfriend)'s computer cant access chatrooms or messengers, or knock-off messengers, so I cant have contact with pedophiles or 50 year old men pretending to be 13 year old girls.   Well, today as I was walking with my parents some old farts sitting on a bench started making kissing noises at me and saying stuff like "hey girl." LMFAO  I still like boston though. Im going to go to college here when im older. i love crazy people, and hippies, and snobs, and democrats. so this is the perfect place for me. ill work at a health food store and meet my future husband there. :-D  Anyway  Tomorrow we're going to plimoth plantation. I get to harass the people/actors dressed as pilgrims and ask questions such as  "how much do you get paid" "what time do you start work"  Etc... its so funny they always go  "i have no idea what youre talking about"  lmfao. anyway. hope i dont get shot (georges dream, and my sisters. lmao. oh goody. maybe ill hide in the building until its time to go.)  anyway. my legs are asleep. ill crawl to the tv and ruin my eyes.

      Well, I'm in boston now. Sitting on the floor in my sisters apartment. Sams cutting vegetables, and my moms watching some woman outside. We're going to go to the blue hills tomorrow. Thats basically it..........   Whee.

      Well. Today is my last day here before going on up to Boston for awhile. Road triiiiiiiiip. I'm waiting for the people to be gone. Our neighbor and her daughter are over here doing something, and I'd rather not talk to them. We'll be there for 5 days, but it will take us 3 days to drive up there, and 3 days to drive back. My sister will be driving back down with us.   Woohoo, are  they gone.  I heard "bye"  Hmmm...  perhaps I shall venture out into the wild >_0

      So, you know. I woke up relatively early, but then managed to fall back asleep. I would have woken myself up that time if I didn't have the most wonderful dream. I dreamed that us women were prisoners of men, but had managed to escape from the prison. On doing so, we started to hunt down the men, and make them our own prisoners (and kill them ;-) ). Womyn power.

      You're pro-life, and yet... you're mostly middle-aged balding fat men who will never experience the risk of getting pregnant.  You like war, and yet... you'll never fight in one.  You're upper class, and have plenty of money, and yet... you don't work for it. You'd like to rule the world, and yet... you're destroying it.  You love your country and if you could you'd hump it to death, and yet... cause everyone else to hate it.  You claim those who challenge the president are unpatriotic, yet you've never done one patriotic thing in your life.

      Awhile ago while I was at the beach, there were some pretty rough waves, and one ended up smacking me pretty hard and my left boob decided to pop out...  Today while I was doing meals on wheels, I was wearing my shorts and it wasnt until I got home and returned from the 7/11 as well, that I saw a huge hole in the crotch/ass area. Lmfao.   Then later today at the beach, I was attempting to make a sand castle, and I kept going back to the water to wash the sand off my ass. And this one huge wave hit my ass the last time I did so, and my ass became exposed... lmfao..  Yet at the waterpark on that really fast slide where I felt like I would fly off, nothing happened to me..

      I've come to the conclusion that most of Sarasota is filled with republican dumbasses missing half their brains. Ugh. I really wish I lived in Boston still. People had brains there. They were fucking assholes, but they had brains.

      So, my sister called up this morning, and we started talking about my parents and I driving up to Boston to stay with her, then her coming back down with us to Florida. We started talking about how we would go to the water park, and then of course..  She starts talking about how we should go out to eat at a steakhouse. And I was like "ew." And she said "Oh, yeah. I forgot. Well, you can eat a salad."   Me - "I don't like salads." Her - "Come on" Me - "I don't eat salads..." Her - "Oh my god. Come on Shelly. You can't force your beliefs onto other people. Just because you're a vegetarian doesn't mean you have to make other people be one."   Lmfao. All I was saying was that I didn't want to go to a fucking steakhouse, and that I usually don't eat salads. And it makes sense that I wouldn't want to go to one, since I'm a fucking vegetarian. Jesus christ. And its not like my parents would go to one anyway. They stopped eating red meat.   Anyway, then she called back and talked to my mom, and in referring to me she said something along the lines of...  "You spoil your children and let them do whatever they want so they grow up to become spoiled horrible brats."   How am I spoiled? I simply don't want to eat dead animals.

      Yeah, anyway. I think we're seeing the Manchurian Candidate today. That should be fun...  Yesterday I went shopping for school clothes. Crappo, I have nice clothes. Most of them were pretty cheap because there was no state sales tax, and many people were having sales. lmfao. I got 2 pairs of pants from one store that were originally 48 dollars each, but i ended up getting them for like 42 dollars all together. So they were like 21 dollars. I think thats pretty good considering the jeans actually fit me and didnt look ugly. Seriously. Whenever I come across cheap pants, they usually fit me just right, but they're way too long. Or they're the right length, but they're too baggy.  But you know, nothing in wetseal fit me, and their pants were like 40 dollars. Well, I got a shirt that was 5 dollars (it was originally like 15 or 25, I forgot)...  Yeah, yeah. I'll stop talking about clothes.  I think I'm gonna eat my salsa even though its been out for like... 4 days. :-D
