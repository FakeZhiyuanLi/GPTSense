      Sorry, late posting, ytd was too tired to post. Wow, ytd is since a fortnight ago, i went back to church. Got a friend to help me ask his dad to help burn his CD of e-bible, was told that his dad would be more than happy to help burn for others as he wanted to distribute the CDs. Demo need to wait until last sunday of the month to get the CD,coz thay are in the U.S..sigh

      That was a bad game though.Greece went kelong and got the 1st goal, oh man, lucki i din buy this match.. but thay got another goal by panelty. Protugal realli no form today... goal onli in the 90 min extended time.... tt is 93 mins... i pity those proto fans, i tink thay have seen enough.. inmagine..the organizing country loosing to Greece in the 1st match... hope that in tml's match, England can win France... that is all for this night.. cya ppl.
