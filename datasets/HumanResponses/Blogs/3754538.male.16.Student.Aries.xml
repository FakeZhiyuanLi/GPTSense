      being normal or average isn't all that bad  av*er*age - The usual or ordinary kind or quality Synonyms: average, medium, mediocre, fair, 1middling, indifferent, tolerable Average and medium apply to what is midway between extremes and imply both sufficiency and lack of distinction.  so your not extreme and you don't stand out from the pack, but you're sufficient. no one will notice you. but you'll get along just fine so it doesn't really matter anyway. live it up in your own, personal, average way.

      I work at McDonald Garden Center.  I was putting labels on pots of ornamental grass and was reading the description out of boredom. Looking at the listed height, the label clearly stated a max height of 6 inches. The plant was already at least 2 and 1/2 feet tall.   A bush with all white flowers. The label glorified the "vibrant pink, yellow, or red flowers."  Can't remember any others right now but there were some more.   You'd think such an established company could at least get the labels (that they print themselves) straight.

      There are certain types of people that I can not stand. In some cases it might be due to some minor annoyance. People who always HAVE to be right. People who won't ever keep their mouths shut even when its the obviously socially polite thing to do. People who offer their support and offer to side with you only to change faces and drop you the moment someone else they like better comes along. A little common courtesy and decency doesn't take much. Which brings me to what people do that really pisses me off. When someone simply won't leave someone else alone. Those people who are somehow offended by ever action and the general existence of the other person and persist in showing this whenver they can. They'll bring up their hatred of the person in jokes, in websites they make, in casual conversations. They'll even start to shun the friends of the person. Why? No better reason then their own immaturities. Often times everyone they known will get tired of hearing about the fact that they hate the one person. This doesn't stop them either, they often will treat it as a minor obsession. They can't just shut the fuck up and go on with life. If you're someone like the aforementioned, do everyone a favor and come up with something new to waste your time on or kill yourself. Have a nice day.

      a conversation with my cousin George (he was looking at a Star Wars picture book of movie props and stuff):  him: why do their (stormtroopers) helmets have padding? me: so it doesnt hurt their heads him: they dont deserve it, theyre evil me: they still should get padding him: theyre always shooting the good guys me: so, its what theyre told to do (I left the room)  And it got me to thinking. Everyone's always against the Empire because they're the " bad  guys." But think for a minute. The " good  guys" are the REBELLION. Some key words in the that are REBEL and REBELLION.  re*bel - To refuse allegiance to and oppose by force an established government or ruling authority.   re*bel*lion - Open, armed, and organized resistance to a constituted government.   Let's get this straight. The "good guys" are in opposition of the current ruling government? The "good guys" have a dying religion on their side, that was and is persecuted by the ruling government  making the ruling and established government the " bad  guys."   Looking at what we've found out it becomes obvious that the names need to be switched. The "good guys" should be the government in power. The "bad guys" the rebels. Just like in the middle east. The (good guys/ middle eastern government/ empire) are being attacked by the (bad guys/ raical terrorists/ rebel alliance).   P.S. I dont want to hear any Star Wars history lessons proving my arguement wrong. I'm going purely off the three older movies and ignoring everything else.

      To explain my point from the above title I'll first offer up an account of something that happened today:          I'm recently home from work at McDonald Garden Center and want to finish watching a movie that I had started the night before. My visiting cousin (age 6) and my younger brother (age 13) are off playing upstairs so I sit down in the family room and begin to watch my movie {rated PG-13 (my cousin cant watch PG-13 rated movies yet)}. My younger brother comes downstairs and is mad that I'm watching the movie without him even though i was the one who rented it for me! so takes the cousin and goes to talk to my mom. She comes and bitches at me about restricting that part of the house from my cousin, who is leaving soon so why cant i wait, and so on and so forth. I leave disgusted and get yelled at by my dad because me younger brother verged on a crying fit when i glared at him {he's 13 remember: a bit old for crying and moaning about every last thing (such as something as minor as your older brother glaring at you)}. After chilling in my room for a little while I walk downstairs to go outside and lo-an-behold! Westley (brother) and George (cousin) are using the TV to play a video game! It wasnt that I was restricting the room from them but that they (Westley) wanted what I had. AND WAIT WHATS THAT GAME'S RATING? TEEN? MUCH LIKE A MOVIE RATING OF PG-13? JUST MAYBE!? so you see... I get bullshited outta watching my movie and yelled at twice because the younger brother can go moaning to mom. I don't blame George (cousin), he tried to say that he didn't even want to use the room before he was told to be quiet by Westley. It was all thanks to Westley and him being a self-centered prick who wants whatever I have or am using. And thanks to him being the youngest brother. My parents help him get everything that he wants, even if its mine. (more to come later probably)

      And God said to Ben, "Thou shalt injure thine foot in a foolish way, and thou shalt become extremely bored during thine own recovery time, causing thy self to write a guest article for thine brother’s blog."  If divine endorsement doesn’t convince you Dan fans, let’s just say the devil made me do it.  Before being giving the unique opportunity to appear in my brother’s blog, my fraternal unit told me that this article must fulfill one of three requirements. It must be –  1. Blazingly funny. 2. Bitingly sarcastic. Or, 3. Incredibly demeaning to our current Commander-In-Chief, the honorable George "Dubya" Bush.  Knowing that I would fail miserably if I tried to imitate Dan’s bone-dry cynicism or dogmatic liberalism (which is, quite frankly, inimitable), I first attempted to write a humor piece, much like the ones I do for the NYU publication, The Plague. I quickly realized, however, that although my massive compendium of fart and anal sex jokes may occupy the upper echelons of all that is humorous, I unfortunately do not have the writing talents to accurately capture the intricacies of aforementioned subject matter.  Therefore, I apologize, Dan, for failing miserably to fulfill any of your blog’s requirements, and will commence to ramble on in my usual, insecure, neurotic way as I do in my secret journals. (Which, of course, do not exist.) (Or do they?) (Duh duh dummm….)  With regards to writing, two thoughts have been occupying my mind lately. Poker and the huge gash on my right foot, currently held together by eight medical sutures, courtesy of Dr. Gilbert Williams, MD. When I first sat down to write this article, I wondered, much as you yourself are probably wondering now, what could possibly be the connection between these two extremely disparate subject matters. The answer my mind came up with, heavily under the influence of painkillers and antibiotics, was luck.  I have decided, in a simplistic, over-stated manner befitting this blog, that luck, or good luck anyway, is the result of not doing stupid things. The converse is true as well, that if one performs many bad or idiotic things, shit’s gonna happen to that fool. Although my modest nature prevents me from self-flattery, I have always been unusually good at not doing stupid things. That’s why I have become skilled at poker. It is a game primarily of chance, but also one of not doing stupid things.  So I was pretty proud of myself for being good at not doing stupid things. Then something happened the other. I did a stupid thing. I, barefoot, tried to make a gap that the laziest part of my brain convinced me I did not need to walk around.  "Go on, Ben." It said. "You don’t need to walk ALL the way around there… just jump it. Come on….." That part of my brain sent images of me, Prince of Persia style, jumping slow motion over that gap in slow motion as "Eye Of the Tiger" played in the background, with personalized words, just like that Starbucks commercial.  (sung to the tune of "Eye of the Tiger") "BEN! BEN BEN BEN!!! BENNNNNNNN…. Ben’s the man, Jumping those gaps…  Wearing his lifejacket, And no shoes. He is a…. Sailing instructor…."  Or something like that.  Regardless of theme songs, I, in what is now in the running for dumbest move of my entire life, listened to that part of my brain.  Now, I have a six inch gash in the bottom of my foot and half to hobble around on crutches.  And my foot hurts.  A lot.  So, in conclusion, kids, listen to your elders, don’t drink, be promiscuous, or do dumb stuff.  Hey, one out of four ain’t bad.  Much love to all,  -Ben

      Use chilled root beer. If it isn't cold it will melt the ice cream too fast and end up giving you a room temperature, nasty-flavored, funny-colored root beer mess (it will not be cooled by the ice cream as i thought it would). You want the best of both ice cream and root beer but you don't want them blended. It tastes gross.   BTW: I am still pissed at costco for no longer stocking frostie; the best (and cheapest) root beer ever. I know Josh is with me on this one.

      today my dad's high school friend (Mark Gordon) and his two daughters (3 and 5) were over at our house. had my camera and the youngest one wanted to take a picture. i gave her the camera and showed her which button to press. she took a picture of me (or the wall, it was iffy considering her skills in aiming the camera). then, holding the camera out she asked me to show her the picture. i was confused. she kept asking to see the picture. then i realized that damn, my camera and i were outdated. she didnt even recognize the non-digital camera. yea i could show her the pictures... in about a week. an hour if i had the money. so yeah... i felt the equivalent of some old person with the youngin' not knowing about the possibility of a non-digital camera instead of them not knowing about records or something. i'm only 16, this isn't supposed to be happening yet.

      I tend to be slow to anger. When i get mad or pissed at something it'll slowly build up. This is unfortunate. By the time i'm really angry about some situation everyone else will be moving on and i'll be just ready to say something. Comebacks and retorts always come to me after-the-fact. I'll get worked up and want to yell at someone but if i do i'll sound ridiculous because the whole thing would be coming out late and my off timing would just annoy the person(s).            _______________________  Just trying to peg a name, to that feeling I get when I'm with you. (old poetry that never got expanded upon)            _______________________  Competition is for people unsure of their own standings and they need to beat people to build an identity for themselves. (don't immediatly assume i'm talking about sports or school, because i'm not)            _______________________  Self expression using a limited number of cuss words is an art. Few can paint masterpieces. Most butcher even their preschool fingerpainting equivalents. (i don't claim to be good at it, and don't always appreciate it)
