K: hey hey, you'll be coming back to school okay. this is just another holiday~  M: hehe..thats right!  W: any plans people??  L: yeah, i'm going hawaii~  W: wow, mr rich guy..  L: =.=  M: huh? thats good, ive never even been on a plane...  L: hey hey, did i say im going alone? ive got tickets for all of you!  K: you what?! you insane weirdo! were not even sure if we'll be free!  L: you will be, and you must be. cos its already bought.i mean the tickets, air tickets.  M: wow, lucky people. i guess im going to stay here by myself then..sigh  L: i said all of you! that includes you mika, although im rather raw to you. but its okay, im not paying, my father is. [sick face]  W: not surprising~ hes full of surprises.  L: big deal. i dont even give a damn.  K: . . . . . chail, why are you so quiet? arent you excited over the trip?  C: its not that, im not sure if i can make it, i have to...  L: everyone's going and thats that!  C: fine!  W: hey bud, what kind of hotel are we staying at? im not going to sleep by the shore~  L: =.= as if i am~ its some nice place i heard. quite popular among tourists.  M: how many days?  L: six days, five night.  all: woooooooooooooo~~~  L: so coming?  all: yeah!  L: good, setting out on monday. today's friday, so you people got two more days to feed your luggage.. okay?  K: i'll try..  W: mika, can you go?  M: why not? it will be fun wont it?  K: i guessed, but..  M: leon will be there to protect me  K: sigh. good..  C: you three sound funny. is there something we dont know?  K/W/M: nothing~  L: wow, same reply.  C: hmm...  K: really, can we go grab something to eat? im starved.  W: yea, lets...  there really something going on between the three. wind doesnt know mika wrote that paper to kyle, kyle doesnt know mika wrote a letter for leon, leon doesnt know that letter is from mika and threw it away, mika doesnt know wind read the letter. wow, havoc~ anyway, i hope this explanation help those who are already lost~ =]  --------------------------------------------------------------------  monday arrived...  L: c mon c mon where are they, theyre late. all at the same time!  uncle jaff: youn..i mean leon, theyre only afew minutes late, please be patient. anyway the plane is not taking off yet.  L: i know, but im so ex..hey wind!!  wind drag his feet, slowly approaching leon like a zombie.  L: wow, you look half dead.  W: look at the time~, it not even morning yet! what a perfect timing to catch a flight...  L: gheez...here comes kyle and chail...here girls!  K: yawnz..yes we see you...  C: stretch herself, yeah..its so outstan..yawnnnnnnnn  L: you people look as if i forced you all to come.  C/K/W: you sure did...yawn [at the same time]  uncle jaff: you'll get your sleep on the plane. is everone here already young master?  L: [sharp look]  uncle jaff: i mean leon.  L: one more, mika.  then theres a shrill cry from the back. a young lady dressed in striking pink tees came forward, with a luggage twice her size[also pink]  W: whoa mika, whats this? you trying to smuggle your family over?  K: hahaha..youre mean!  M: and youre nowhere better to laugh at that!  K: [shocked]  C: how fiery, leon, this is definitely not the best time to set off. were all so moody..  L: oh nevermind, you'll get all the rest you want on the plane...  uncle jaff: i'll pick you up on saturday night then, leon. i'll take my leave.  L: thank you uncle. alright people, lets hit hawaii!  all: yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.yawn  --------------------------------------------------------------------  on the plane...  M: shall i sit with you leon?  L: err...  W: c mon mika, i'll sit with you..  M: no! i want leon!  K: chail, i'll sit with you then..  L: hey kyle...  K: yes?  L: oh nevermind...  M: humph! we'll sit together wind.  W: huh what? oh sure [grin]  M: wipe it off~  L: well, guess im a loner~  the journey was fine, just that kyle kept turning over to peek at mika, who was also peeking at leon. wind realised of cos, and did many "stupid" actions. chail was also trying to make best use of her time to draw, with wind as her live model~ leon obviously couldnt care less. hes thinking again [he loves thinking, especially when left alone]..  from the back of the plane, someone shouted..  ???: hi leon!!!

M: book? what book? i didnt see any book~  W: uh whatever. by the way, did your new friend tell you why he ran away from home this time?  M: leon? not that i know of, but i overheard his sle...oh nothing nevermind..  W: sleep? what sleep? you mean you two share the same bed?!  M: basically, yes. but dont let your dirty thoughts run wild, we merely sleep. S.L.E.E.P [spells out]  W: fine. i didnt say anything to begin with~   leon was a distance away from them at the front, dragging his heavy footsteps as he proceed to the classroom.  M: he looks kind of depressed or something..  W: i thought so too. better find out what wrong [open mouuth wide, ready to shout] hey, le...  M: [quickly covers wind's mouth] shh! he wants to be left alone.   W: [silent for a while, direct contact with mika]..how do you know??  M: i just know [recalls the sleeptalk]..quit talking, were reaching class already.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  in kyle's class, mrs peterson [physics teacher] was going through some examination papers. and kyle wasnt in the right mood to pay any attention.  C: pss..kyle. shes calling you..  K: huh? yes? what mrs peterson?  peterson: ive asked my question and whatever made you think i will repeat?  K: im sorry, im not listening. [apologetic face]  peterson: sigh. sometimes i wonder if you people are ready for your exam. you all are just too relaxed you see. and....  she went on and on, like any other teachers  C: you are so distracted today. are you sure youre fine? are you unwell?  K: no, im thinking of some things..  C: like?  K: [smile] nothing [firm]  C: humph! fine!  K: [turn away, looks at watch]..6..5..4..3..2..1..  *RING*  peterson: okay class, we'll stop here today. your homework will be..  class: groan~~~~~~  peterson: its part of your revision. due next week. alright go for your recess now.  class move out, including kyle and chail.  K: going for recess? im starving~  C: ah alright...but not until you tell me what is bothering you!  K: i thought u said fine?  C: i did. but im still cur..  mika approached the two girls. holding on to the book she found.  K: hi mika, and whats that in your hand? isnt that mine?  M: hello kyle, and chail. yup its yours, you left it on the bench in the morning. so here i am~  K: thank you. want to join us for recess?  M: another day perhaps, i have alot of work to do.  K: oh alright then, catch you around~  M: bye..  mika walks off, frequently turning around to look at kyle and the book. sorta like wanting her to open it up and flip through the pages.  C: shes cute. but how busy can the second day of third year be?  K: [shrugs]..oh no..20 minutes left! run!!!  the girls took off for the canteen. theyre fast eaters, but the qeues are always stretching from one point of the canteen to the other. thats reason enough for them to rush~  -----------------------------------------------------------------  mika glance out of the window, lonely. her only friends in class are wind and leon, yet both of them are out there in the basketball court. she let her right arm support the weight of her head, and gazed out into the court. obviously she was looking at leon, but the attention she got was from wind, who actively tried to make some funny moves to impress mika.  the boys moved into the classroom after playing..  W: did you see that? its a three pointer!  M: no. im not even looking at you boys play, im searching for ideas.  W: for?  M: my composition! why are you always poking your nose into my life!  W: sorry~  M: argh! move away, you stink!  leon walked past. also...erm...wet.  M: erm leon..  L: [turns to mika]  M: i, uh...nothing..  L: [whisper] crazy..  W: indeed she is, crazy, over you that is~  L: oh shut up! shes staring at you throughout the game~ shes interested in you~~~  W: really you think so??  L: =.= i really give up on you! [walks off]  W: why?? hey why!!  leon ignored him and went back to his seat, drenched and exhausted. it was then that he realise theres a letter under his table, pink envelope, purple words. yuck, he thought to himself, must be a girl. without thinking, he aimed the letter at the wastepaper basket and threw it. mika and wind saw what he did, but kept silent and pretended not to see.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  after school, mika and wind were the only two whos in the classroom. they were exceptionally slow in packing their bag today.  W: erm mika, why dont you go first? im not done yet.  M: neither am i, you should go first, leon's waiting outside.  W: oh nono, you go first, i need to stay back for awhile.  M: [glance at the wastepaper basket] sigh. okay i'll be going then, cya.  W: tomorrow~  mika went out of the room, wind made sure shes out before he took the letter from the wastepaper basket, leon's letter. he put it inside his folder and zipped his bag. next, he went out to find a rather impatient leon.  L: are you hatching eggs of what?!  W: not egg, not "what".  L: then?  W: slow......................................[draggy]  L: argh, im surprised i survived with you for so long!  W: the feeling is mutual. hahahahahah.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  kyle was back at home, its already night time by now. she flipped through her notebook and a piece of paper fell out. she wondered who that was from, she unfolded it and at the bottom corner it reads: [From-Mika]

      :||chapter 5||:  M: oh no! must be my sister! quick hide!  L: nice suggestion. but theres no place to hide in here...  M: quick, under the blanket!  leon hurriedly pull the blanket over himself, lying as flat as possible. when he felt a heavy weight press on his stomach, its mika~  L: OWW!!!  M: be quiet! shh. shes coming already.  door open suddenly.  M: err...hi..youre early today.  sister: are you insane?! early?! look at the clock my girl..  M: oh..haha..1.16am..still acceptable..  sister: hmm..youre not yourself today..whats under your blanket?  M: blanket? huh what blanket? theres nothing. [starts bouncing on leon]  L: [argh, my bones are breaking! will she stop it!]  sister: ah whatever. im too tired to bother about you. remember my breakfast tomorrow before you go to school~ nights  M: nights [quickly shut door behind her]  leon pull away the blanket, gasping big mouthful of air and constantly rubbing his tummy..  L: owww.......................  M: im so sorry, ive to make it real you see. sorry...  L: hey i didnt blame you did i? just...dont try it again.  M: [smile] okay!  L: shhh......  M: oops..hehe..  that giggle reminds leon of kyle. at last.  L: oh no! i need to make a phone call!  M: to who? its so late now, he must be sleeping already. theres school tomorrow you know.  L: right..we better sleep too. i dont want to be punished on two consecutive days. and i have to go earlier to get my uniform from wind. [yawn]  M: alright then. lets sleep.  L: [nod]  there and then they slept, but mika was awaken in the middle of the night. leon was sleep talking. shes stunned by the content. then leon turned around and his arm went over mika's shoulder, she almost scream, but she didnt. instead, she stayed awake until it was morning, with leon's arm over her.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  leon woke up and the sky wasnt even bright yet.mika was no longer on the bed. he waited, lying flat and staring at the ceiling. then slowly observe the small, messy room. posters all around, and a table with books overlapping each other, creating a moutain of paper. he got out of bed, straighted his clothes and hair, and went looking for mika.  L: [soft] mika.where are you?  M: huh? oh good morning. im preparing breakfast. and dont speak too loudly, my sister is still sleeping.  leon went up closer to her, he peered over her shoulders. fried egg.   L: mmmm. smells nice.  M: its just eggs, havent you had any eggs before?  L: [walks away]  M: get ready, we can go once im done.  L: okay. whats the time now? i cant find the clock. you ought to fix some lamp in here.  M: comment appreciated, but wont be considered. still early, at least enough time for you to catch up with wind.  L: good.  M: okay im done. lets go shall we?  L: sure thing~ what about breakfast??  M: take it~  she threw a lunch box at leon, only that its packed with breakfast not lunch. mika picked up her bag and got out of the house, closing the door gently so as to make the minimal noise.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  M: um leon. you were talking in your sleep yesterday. and i overheard  L: really? what did i say? did i blurt out my secret crush? haha  M: urm no..but actually you did mention something about your family.  L: i did?   M: ya. and you dont sound too surprised to me.  L: i dont see the need to, must be about my father right?  M: im so sorry i overheard.  L: no sweat, u probably cant sleep with my mumbling too. anyway its no big deal, just dont go around helping me advertise okay?  M: [nod + smile] anyway what exactly is.......  then wind came running up to them, huffing and puffing. with a rather big bag, hanging from his shoulders and several books supported by one hand.  W: ...your...your...shirt...  L: good morning~ and thank you. but i dont see where i can change~ so no point rushing to pass it to me right.  M: you can change here, its the alley~ not many people passes by  L: =.= uh huh. with you around?  mika turned around, facing the wall while she heard wind unzipping his bag and retriving the uniform. before long, leon was done  L: done! you can turn around now.  M: [slowly turn over, observe from head to toe, then cover eyes again] your zipper!  L: [looks down, embarassed] oops sorry~  W: well it seems that you two are getting along veri well uh? what happened during the night? anything other than sleep?  M/L: NO!  W: whoa whoa. okay okay.   L: can we move it, we dont have all day..  -----------------------------------------------------------------  *tap tap*  C: hello pretty girl!  K: huh? hey hi..  C: do you happen to be waiting for leon?  K: uh no..i mean..maybe..i dont know  C: are you falling into his trap? wake up girl! its broad daylight, dont be that silly as to follow the footsteps of other girls in school! they are blind!  K: no no of cos not. im just too stressed up i guess. still in my holiday mood~  C: oh i see. but you better dont fall for that idiot. bernard is still waiting for you~~~  K: oh stop it! i made it clear to him long ago. and im determined not to get involved in such things..at this time..  C: well well..love is unstoppable and unpredictable.. just like my wind..ahh..he blows me crazy~~~~  K: you are seriously love sick! i shant bother myself with you. look! theyre heading this way, mind your words.  C: i'll try~  K/C: hello people!  L: hi kyle............................................and chail  C: oh forget it. what unwillingness. hey wind! i thot u require tutoring?  W: oh yea you reminded me, we'll go over to that side. its abit noisy over here.  C: okay..tata people~!  chail and wind walks away, and by the way, they are not together. wind have absolutely no idea chail is so crazy over him, and wind's puppy love is mika. the first~  K: whos this?  L: oh shes..  M: hi im mika, nice to meet you. ive heard so much about you kyle.  L: since when?  M: then!  K: hehehe..anyway leon, you didnt call back yesterday huh! what audicity!  M: huh? [so it was kyle]  L: well urm. i was kind of occupied you see...  K: with what? [stole a glance at mika]  L: nothing to do with you. anyway you better go now, your lesson is starting. and please bring chail away from wind.  leon notice how chail concentrate on wind more than on the topic they were discussing.  K: fine! GOOD BYE! [stomp off, pulling chail by the sleeve]  M: [shocked] she sound offended..  L: ah its nothing, she'll gets better by the end of the day.  W: hey hey! what happened to kyle? she looked charcoal.  M: huh?  L: he meant angry.   M: oh. leon was trying to..  L: to calm her down but i failed..so too bad~  M: =.= are you sure thats what youre trying to do?  L: quite~  W: you two seem closer within one day. behaving just like couples~ [heartbroken]  M: [blush] nonsense! were not!  L: exactly, you didnt notice how chail looked at you just now. shes was about to devour you if your great ol buddy didnt come to your rescue.  W: pardon me?  L: oh nevermind.  M: we better get to class now, we dont have much time left.  W: agree.  leon and wind walked off first, but mika stood there packing her stuff [guys are always inconsiderate]. that was when she found a notebook on the table. she took it and flip to the veri first page  . she pondered for a while...  W: mika! hurry up!  mika shove the book into her bag and ran after the boys...

      :||chapter 4||:  K: hello hello? leon?  C: hey! waddaya mean? is my presence unwelcomed?!  K: oh. hi chail. no thats not what i meant. anyway, can i help you?  C: supposed to be. but it seems that youre the one with problem now? gossip gossip~  K: huh? me? no nothing really. just kinda tired i guessed.  C: oh okays. well, ive had a wonderful day! out at the library with...wind~. will urm. others as well.  K: here we go again...yes yes yes wind wind wind. would you like some rain to go with it? (giggles)  C: =.= hey!  K: hehe. anyway, i was still wondering why you didnt go to the bus stop until leon told me...today  C: leon? oh that guy. he went home early, like he got chronic disease or something. [hes just unwell]  K: huh?  C: oh nevermind. and why are you waiting for his call? arent you sick of calling him daily?  K: hes just my soul mate, like you! and why cant the two of you stop bickering for a day.  C: [shrugs] god knows~ anyway i dont find him irritating if he dont open his mouth. hes quite nice actually, for me to quarrel with.  K: i am speechless. hows your first day?  C: ah. no difference. you should know theres not much different between year 3 and year 4. but i kinda serious now, given the fact that ive been slacking for one whole year.  K: i guessed so. it cant be more obvious with a result like that.  C: that is a bit too direct~  K: haha. im just joking anyway. whats keeping that leon???  C: sigh. maybe he forgot~ like always~ or maybe hes not even intending to call.  K: i guessed thats the case. well then. what else do you require my help on young lady?  C: theres this [blah blah blah]  -----------------------------------------------------------------  back to leon...and mika  L: wohoh! whats this? your house?  M: thats some nice comments coming from you~ bet the condition of your house aint anywhere better~  L: well that you are wrong. it is far more better  M: yeah what? more toilet bowls or something?  L: [recalls its the first day he met mika] nevermind, its not too much better.  M: i knew it. not as if youre some son of a millionaire~   leon just smile back...  M: [uncomfortably] urms..where would you like to sleep?  L: that is the responsibility of the owner to arrange, not the guest.  M: the balcony says welcome~  L: what?!  M: haha. kidding. i dont want my sister to come back and start screaming thief, so i suppose you cant sleep in the living room. master bedroom is out of bound. youre left with kitchen and my room, take your pick~  L: its obvious aint it?  M: oh...kitchen...  L: NO!  M: hahahahahaha. okay, this way please prince leon. your hmuble servant at your service.  L: [uh its not as bad as "young master"] certainly..lead the way..[laughs]  mika's phone rang~  not that mika's house is too gigantic for leon, hes trying to hide his true identity from his new found friend. at least it marks the begining of a true friendship, without mika knowing much about leon. perhaps better that way, leon dont want to let them know too much about his backgound. hes life is a secret to begin with..  -----------------------------------------------------------------  *beep beep*  --one missed call--  W: huh? hmm.. whos this? [calls back]  M: hello?  W: mika! how did you manage to get my number?? [surprised + overjoyed]  M: oh..i wasnt the one who called you. its leon.  W: leon?  M: hes running away from home you see and hes lucky to bump into me~  L: [from the background] is it wind? give it to me!  M: its my phone!  L: its my friend!  M: [pass phone to leon..unwillingly]  L: thank YOU. hello wind???  W: yes prince? whatever gives you the urge to run away from home? thrill?  L: of course not. my father's back today, and we had some..erm..discussion..  W: i suppose you mean row.  L: somewhere near there. anyway, i dont hav a unifrom to wear tomorrow! so do you think...  W: argh. i know it cant be anything good.  L: haha. thanks buddy! be in school earlier yea?  W: [grumble grumble] okay....................................  "MY PHONE BILL!!!" mika  L: oops. see you tomorrow then. byeE  W: hey wait!  *toot~* hang up  W: aww man. nevermind, at least i got her number~ [delighted]  not long later.....  *ring ring*  W: hello?  jaff: hello wind, did leon call you? hes run away from home again.  W: ye..i mean no  jaff: are you sure? thats what you said the last time.  W: quite sure, ive been trying to contact him the whole day~ [fingers crossed]  jaff: well then, please kindly inform me if he did. his father is rather worried about him you see.  W: [yea right..everyone knows that the servants care about leon more than his father does] okay uncle jaff.  jaff: thank you. and have a nice night, goodbye.  W: bye. [put down phone]  some background information: wind had been leon's good friend since...erm...long ago. yeah. that explains why theyre so close uh? okay back to story...  -----------------------------------------------------------------  at mika's house...already late..  L: whoa. only one bed???  M: im not too fat as a matter of fact, i dont need two.  L: alright then, looks like i'll be sleeping on the floor.  M: nonono..as the guest, you cant sleep on the bed.  L: what about you?  M: floor.  L: [guilt] thats not very nice. lets share the bed.  M: [shocked] what?! you dont mean it do you?  L: im too tired to joke around..*yawn*..so what do you say?

      :||chapter 3||:  K: hello. may i....  L: speaking~  K: [giggles] hello leon. hows your first day at school?  kyle loves giggling. and leon loves her giggles. kyle's his senior in school, same grade as chail, but entirely different chracter. kyle is sweet and demure. and chail is..well..youve seen for yourself~  L: hahaha. well not too bad actually. if u minus bumping into chail and punished by mr Alkitoria. a row i would call it. he almost kill me with a chopper. luck with mi, he doesnt hav one at that time.  K: [giggles...again] oh leon. why are you always so funny. mr alkitoria may be abit fierce. but hes a nice tutor deep inside.  L: that must be really deep. cos i cant even feel it, must be his extra thick insulating layer keeping it within~  K: oh thats enough. i missed chail at the bus stop, im supposed to be waiting there for her. but she didnt arrive, i wonder why.  L: wonder no more~ shes went to the library with nick and the rest. not surprising she didnt tell you. what an irresponsible woman. you really must have a hard time trying to stand her arrogance and such. gross.  K: you mean it? she went off without me? without informing me? my goodness. but then again, she may have forgotten. she wont do it on purpose im sure. shes not that type of person.  L: only you would believe that. she and i are two like poles of a magnet, never try to put us together. hmm...your purpose of calling miss?  K: oh yea. practice resume next week, usual time and location. hehe. best of luck~ miss trik certainly doesnt want us to lag behind uh.  leon was startled by the loud banging on the door of his room.  L: uh..think so. hey i have to hang up, call u later tonight. bye. [hang up immediately, not waiting for vyle's reply]  K: o....kay [too late]  leon open the door. only to find...  father: you brat! whoever give you the right to loiter outside after school! youve already driven your mother to her grave, are you trying to do the same to me!  L: not if i can help it. im not your lackey, im your SON. if you would even bother checking the meaning of that word in the dictionary! cos i dont even think you know how to distinguish family from work. if you want to be such a workaholic then stay away from me! go run to all your filthy woman! since they all love cuddling beside you and your dirty money!  father: [slap!] what audicity! whoever gave you the right to talk to me that way! jaff! bring me the cane!  L: no you arent going to do that! [ran away..erm..from home]  jaff: master, youve been too hard on the child. hes only 15, whatever is happening is already too much for him to handle. dont you think...  father: [cuts in..like father like son] no, i dont think its too harsh on that freak. let him run away all he can. i m veri sure he will return, at least by midnight today.  jaff: if thats the case, master. if thats the case.....  -----------------------------------------------------------------  finally. leon broke free from his father's leash. but theres nowhere else for him to go. he wandered on the street, alone and cold.  stranger 1: hey spike head! whats happening at your house uh? explosion?  stranger 2: hahahhahahahahahha  L: LEAVE ME ALONE YOU ARSES!  stranger 1&2: woo..little porcupine got a temper eh. tickle tickle~  L: [punch! oops no words to describe the sound of a punch] NOW STAY AWAY!  yea yea. as if those hooligans will listen. rich guy here doesnt understand. leon was drag, one arm by each of them, into the back alley. dark and smelly. and, the fighting continue. its a two against one, so its rather obvious leon cant outbeat them~  stranger 1&2: run home boy! and dont let us see you again!  L: cough cough. [many bruises]  leon got up. staggered afew steps and collapsed, his injured leg hardly able to withstand his weight. he let his eyelid shut, ready to faint. but a thin stick-like hand supported him, trembling. not much help, leon still slowly descend to the wet cement floor.  M: hey wake up! you cant faint here. i dont even have the energy to carry half of your weight.  its useless. leon was already in deep sleep. mika brush off his hair, gently soothing his face, where the bruises were. in her eyes, the new classmate looked like a sleeping baby. and she hold leon even tighter. but..  L: oww..huh?..HEY! what do you think youre doing! [quickly move away]  M: huh? me? nothing. nothing.  L: yea right!~ who knows what you ar..OW..it hurts. argh.  M: i suppose you cant get home by yourself yea?  L: you are asking the obvious. got a phone? i'll call wind. darn. i'll be paralysed for day.  M: call wind? why? you staying with him?  L: of cos not! im running away from home. and i need a place to put up at. quick, can you spare a phoine or not?  M: [grumbles] take it! fancying you running away from home during school days. big mistake.  mika was pretending not to care, but her voice came out realli gentle.  L: damn! no answer! looks like i'll be sleeping in the park today. take your phone back now, miss know-it-all  M: [receive the phone gently] park?! erm..you can come stay at my house for the night if you want. my parents are out.  L: hmm? good idea. thank you then.  M: youre welcome. but first we need to figure out how to move you back to my house. its just across the street. will you have any trouble with it?  L: i dont know, i'll try. [struggles to get up] whoa~  M: [catch leon] gotcha! you can do with a living walking stick.  L: [blush]thanks.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  meanwhile kyle was sitting by the phone. waiting for the phone call.  *ring ring*  -----------------------------------------------------------------

M: yea.there is no reason to punish him, just because he cant express himself.  L: [whisper to wind] is she calling me an idiot?  W: hahaha. i think so.  teacher: have you found something to tell us leon?  L: yea.i hate school.  luaghter again.louder.  teacher: and can u tell us why it is...  bell rang.lesson over  teacher: i shall deal with you, tomorrow.  L: not that i remember seeing your lesson tomorrow in the timetable~  W: stop it, you dont want to be serving detention on your first day do you.  L: fine.  teacher: you better mind your behaviour young lad..  L: i'll try. if you would do the same.  teacher: enough! i dont want to punish you on the first day of the term.  L: you already had~  [cant stand it. teacher stomped out of class]  M: erm leon, do you think we can..  L: no. you dont want to make friend with an idiot who cant express himself do you? gotta run, meeting friends.[runs off]  M: hey wait...  W: hi mika, im wind. nice to meet you. dont worry about leon, he'll forget about it by the next day. just dont make such remarks again okay?  M: im not. im trying to help. dont think he can boss around cos hes...hes..rich and cool.   W: hmm? are you having a crush on him? its not surprsing. many girls fell for him at the first sight.  M: [blushes] me? fall for him? no way! anyway i need to rush home already, my mother is waiting for me. nice meeting you wind, see you in school tomorrow.  W: okay. bye~  -----------------------------------------------------------------  L: are they coming or what. its been so long.  W: patience~ their class may be ending late. by the way, you shouldnt have treated the girl that way just now. its so ungentleman.  L: im not learning to be a gentleman in the first place.   W: i think she feel something for you.   L: yea right. you should know i dont go for girls who throw themselves at me.   W: what a crude way to put it! anyway, even if its true i wont be surprised. ive been your buddy since young, and such scenerio happen just too often.  L: come on, its only the first day of school and the first day she met me. nobody would be dumb enough to believe in love at first sight.  W: you should be glad if she really likes you. shes kind of..cute..  L: wooo..so you are the one feeling for her~ that explains. wake up boy! its only the first day, she might be a wolf in sheep's skin. besides, ive never noticed her in school before, maybe a transfer~  W: thats because youre surrounded by tons of girls everyday, ive seen her in school.  L: what a aimless conversation. cut it out. they are coming already. [wave]  two students approach. rather tired.  N: phew. im already drowned by my timetable on the first day. hardly breatheable.  V: thats right. i dont even think they treat us as human. and look at the books, i can build a house with them.  L: sure seems that you two had a bad day, but mine aint anywhere better, punished for the first day. totally ruin my day.  W: yea. and he got himself a cru..  L: [covers wind's mouth] crunchy tibits. right wind?  W: [muffled] ya ya..  V: 0.o you two are behave weird today. anyway, where are we going?  L: lets hit the mall!  N: how boring. cant we find something constructive to do?  W: erm...like?  N: i dont know, but anywhere is better than the mall.  V: i suggest the library~  L: LIBRARY?!are you a bookworm hungry for books? weve just ended school!  chail walk forward. rather delighted to see the boys.  C: hello juniors~ going somewhere?  W: actually, yes. but that somewhere is undefined.  C: oh. i suggest the library, thats where im heading.  L: hello miss? did we even invite you along? besides, you should be with people from your level, not us.  C: i cant be bothered with you. even if im tagging along, im with wind, vic and nic. you are not even on the list!  L: grr....  V: okay okay. enough already. library yes?  L: most certainly, i dont want to lose my four friends to the witch.  C: are u addressing me?!  L: the truth speaks~  N/V/W: sigh...  -----------------------------------------------------------------  the five of them went to the library, with chail and leon slightly cooled down on the way.  leon looked out of the window. he seemed troubled.  W: leon, i know theres something bothering you, tell me what it is if im your friend.  L: no its nothing. dont bother yourself with it.  C: really wind, you shouldnt. its tough to get through that thick skull of his.  L: . . . im not feel well. im going home.  V: unwell? thats unusual. shall we see you home?  L: nah dont bother. carry on with your studying. [bid farewell]  ----------------------------------------------------------------- leon is really troubled. relationship problems~ and family problem too. unable to stand the way his father neglect the him after his mother died. also, he blames himself for his mother's death.  L: i'm home!  maid: welcome back young master. would you like tea first or bath first?  L: neither. i want nap.  maid: of course, youve had a hard day afterall.  L: wheres auntie Cooper?  maid: in her room, resting.  L: resting? is she unwell?  maid: yes. shes down with slight fever.  L: oh okay. you may go do your work now.  maid: yes young master.  L: [roll eyes]  -----------------------------------------------------------------  L: [knock on door] auntie Cooper?  cooper: yes come in  L: [open door] auntie, im troubled again. over mum's death.  cooper: why my child? its not your fault. nobody would predicted the accident.  L: if i didnt..,  cooper: no ifs. life and death are part of nature. you should learn to accept things as they are.  L: what about father? hes avoiding me. and hes trying to forget by working himself to death arent he?  cooper: certainly not. what made you think that way?  L: my feeling. he hates me. and i hate him too!  cooper: oh no. dont think that way.   L: its true.  cooper: anyway, lets not talk about that. its too much for a boy at your age to bear. hows school?  L: [recalls the classroom incident] acceptable~ [forced]  cooper: glad to hear it. now run along kiddo, auntie is not feeling too well.  L: [walks out of room and close door gently]  leon cant accept the way adults plan things for him [who can?] he still blames himself. just then, the phone rang..  -----------------------------------------------------------------

L: my father? is he even in the country? no! so he wont know even if his son is dead cos hes out there somewhere trying to make millions.  chauffer: oh young master youve mistaken about your father. whatever hes doing is to see u..  L: [cut in] do well~  chauffer: im glad you understand young master  L: dont call me that, it makes me sound terribly old. how many times do i have to correct you. anyway, just dont bother fetching me after school today. you know i will have a way to get out without you noticing  chauffer: as you wish  the car dissapear into the distance, leon turn around and walk into the school compound.  *bump*  W: hey hey! leon! guess what~! we are in the same class again!

L: not that serious ive heard of~  W: urm leon. will you quit talking and help us out?  L: [bend down reluctantly] i dont even know what ive done to deserve this. fancy me picking up books for a girl  C: hello boy?~ in this century, equality speaks. dont put yourself high above the females.  L: good theory. so do everything yourself~ lets go wind  W: hey relax people. its only the first day of school. u two dont have to quarrel everytime you meet right?

K: possibly, i'll go to the balcony for some fresh air, can you help me unpack my things?   C: okay..   kyle walks over to the balcony. she tried taking in deep breath, but failed. she kept thinking about how mika behaved, towards leon. she turn left and right, admiring the scenery, when her eyes met leon. also standing there alone... she wanted to call out, instead she kept quiet and turn around, ready to return to the room. when suddenly leon call her name..
