      hello.  it has been so weird. i have been having these 2 reoccurring dreams. the first one is not as bad but it still bugs me. it is the first day of school and i get there on time for first period but i miss zero hour. and the thing is that i don't care that i missed it. and that bugs me. i have only had it like twice so it's not that bad. but the other one really has been bugging me and i have it more often. in the dream i am always drving. the brakes don't work very well. i will be putting all my weight onto the brake but i never come to a complete stop. i had that dream last night but it was a little worse. like i wrecked my car. and i really hurt myself. i think i am trying to tell myself that i need to slow down before i hurt myself. i have been getting myself wrapped up in many things i really don't need to be involved in and it is kinda putting some stress on me. but the weird thing about the wreck dream is that on the way to work i almost got into 3 wrecks! it really scared me! i am not a bad driver but i just been having problems lately controlling my car(and there is nothing wrong with my car). i have also been having problems controlling my life. hopefully after i move into my new house next saturday things will start to slow down and i can grasp life again.  oh Lord. please let that be the way it will be. i need a break.

      hello. so my parents decided to get a divorce about a week ago. i'm not taking it badly but i have my good days and my bad days. today has been a bad one. i feel empty. my friends try to cheer me up but they are not sure how. i really appreciate all they do for me. micah has really been there for me through all of this. i thank God everyday for bringing him into my life. there are also some other people who have been helping me too and i thank you.
