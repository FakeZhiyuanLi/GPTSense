      So I started on this a few weeks back, conveniently let it slip out of my consciousness amidst a lot of hectic running around, found it on my pc yesterday and finished it up. Sorta. Well, Jien likes it, and that's good enough. *grin*  ------  whispersmurmersemotionalflickerings toss and tumble, light up the night midnight past and still they dance through silence serene, through love and laughter to pierce my soul, to bind in truth demanding utterance, burn and dance.  burn and dance. the tumbling of truth in clumsy phrases that demand their voice for what would love be made in quiet choice if we were afraid and silent shame reigned instead?  daylight spent waiting, nights frittered in dreams new longing in waking new twinges, new achings a meeting of souls, to mingle and fuse to stretch, to blossom to grow in hope, to grow in truth.  confusion that hovers in peripherial whirlings, whirling and wishing, silent and waiting tingle to see, in this inbred uncertainty.  freed from me; to live, to be empty, yet filled; incomplete, yet whole in you.  12.8.2004

       Sometime a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man... It is a feeling in the stomach, a delight in the nerves, of the forearms. The skin tastes the air, and every deep-drawn breath is sweet. Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn; it flashes in the brain and the whole world glows outside your eyes A man may live his whole life in the gray, and the land and tree of him dark and somber... and then—the glory—so that a cricket song sweetens his ears, the smell of the earth rises changing to his nose, and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes. Then a man pours outward, a torrent of him, and yet he is not diminished.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;–John Steinback, East of Eden.  I gave this poem to Ling on the night we talked about  it  for the first time. It was really my second serious attempt at poetry, ever. So ah, be gentle yah :)  ----  These rumblings in my heart, these pangs in my spleen, these moments my being quivers— an arrow lost and markless.  My deep calls and yearns hungers for something someone, somewhere— an ocean, churning, restless.  I am homesick a ship captainless inspirationless grey a wandering heart across midday sun.  Is this love this sorrowful joy this painful touch this throbbing ache a splinter in my existence  Is this love? Every time our minds touch A Spark flies A Fairy lives A Star is born And I am  Complete

      Tertullian famously remarked, “What has Jerusalem to do with Athens?” Faith and reason, passion and intellect, the ideal and the real. Whence shall the twain meet?  Our hearts tug in one direction; our heads in another. Realism and pragmatism weigh heavy upon us. Yet in fear and trembling, our hearts laid in our hands before our Lord, together, we have chosen the straight and narrow path. Till the Shepherd of our Souls leads us on other paths, or brings us in holy union before Him, we shall walk this road hand-in-hand—with no regrets.  This blog is a living memoir of our journey.   Christianity got over the difficulty of combining furious opposites, by keeping them both, and keeping them both furious.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-G.K. Chesterton
