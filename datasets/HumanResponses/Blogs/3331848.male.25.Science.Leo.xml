        Hello to everyone who might happen upon my Blog. Well, I really don't know how to start this. I have never really kept a journal, so I'm not quite sure what to say. I guess I can start out with my CP. For those of you who don't know, CP is short for Cerebal Palsey. Technically, what I have is called Spastic Paraparesis, a mild form of CP. Basically, I walk with a limp. The bones in my legs are not set like a normal person's. My hips, knees, and ankles aren't lined up with each other......therefore the limp. Despite what cerebal implies, I have no problem with my brain capacity. I graduated with a BS in Chemistry with a minor in Math. However, my problem lies all below the waist. From what I have seen I could be a lot worse off than I actually am......for this I am very grateful, but I question everyday why I would be graced with such a defect. I mean why me???? I am by no means a religious person, but I do wonder what could be out there and I like to think that there is a God.......but who really knows right???  Well, I was born with CP, and not until the past several years has it become a problem in my life. I have had two major surgeries to help me deal with it I had the first and biggest one when I was in 5th grade. I was just a baby now that I look back on the whole situation. My parents set everything up and they left the decision up to me. I agreed and spent 3 long and agonizing months in the hospital. My first was called a Dorsal Root Rhizotomy (for those of you interested). I was in surgery for over 10 hours and was one of the first people to ever have it done. They cut open my back and basically severed some nerves in my spinal cord. This was to release tension in my legs. My hamstrings and achilles tendons were extremely tight. I can remember going through a pair of tennis shoes every 3 months when I was younger, pretty crazy huh?? I would wear holes in the toes of my shoes due to me constantly dragging my feet. Well, after the surgery I was bed ridden and had to learn how to walk all over again. Like I said previously, I was in the hospital for 3 months. I had all kinds of therapy everyday, multple times a day. I even had to take classes so I would'nt fall behind in my schooling. After I was discharged I had physical therapy everyday for a year. It was horrible. My mom would drive me to and from Richmond for my daily sessions. At the time we lived about 30 minutes away from the hospital.......believe me that was fun.....not.  While the first surgery helped with the tension in my legs and gave me much more freedom in my movement, I still walked "funny". Hell, I walk funny even as I am writing this post. But like I said I had a second sugery. This one wasn't as big as the first one. It was a simple Grice (sp?) procedure. I had problems with the arch in my feet. I was kinda flat footed after the first surgery and the doctors thought that this might help, and guess what.......it did. They went in and shaved some bone off of my right tibia or was it my fibula (not exactly sure which one, but it was definitely one of the lower leg bones). They took these shavings and inserted them into both of my feet. They packed the shavings on one side and put a screw on the other side. Im not exactly sure how it all works, but I do know it built up my arch which therefore helped me to walk a little bit better. Oh by the way this surgery took place when I was just a freshman in highschool, man that seems like forever and a day ago. Shoo wee where does the time go. Speaking of time, I've been at this for quite some time. I think this is a good point to take a break.  For those of you wondering why I named my Blog what I did, believe me I will get to that eventually.......just give me some time, I am new at this. Well, thanks for listening. I'll be back soon.
