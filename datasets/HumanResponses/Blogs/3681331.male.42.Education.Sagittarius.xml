      When I was growing up one thing I truely loved was the time between 3 and 5 pm.  That was when me and my Mom would talk about life.  Much of who I am now can probably be traced back to those afternoon talks.  The last couple of days I have been having similar chats with a few of my coworkers. We do not talk about the job but more about personal purpose in life and the ongoing development that happens from ages 30-40. Do you have people you can talk to like this?  If you don't try and find some, ask people questions about what they think and listen to what they say, as opposed to being focused on what you are going to say.  I know there is no humor here today and that is not because I don't feel funny, it is only because that is what is on my mind today.  How well do you know the people you know, how often do you talk about things that require deep thinking? In no way am I saying that you should be this way all the time, I am just saying that sometimes I fella has got to do some thinking and talking.

      I have always admired Babe Ruth. He hit 714 homeruns. He ate hot dogs and drank beer and had a belly sticking over his belt. He also seeemed to love being Babe Ruth. I like when someone loves who they are, or at least love the character they have created.  I always get annoyed at tv stars who complain the role typecast them and they could never find any other work. I mean I am sure it happens all the time but look at Cary Grant, people really only wanted to see him be Cary Grant and when he felt he could not do it anymore he just left show business.  Not the Bob Denver or Gary Coleman are in the same league with Cary Grant.  Still Gilligan and Arnold should be satisfied with the work they have done, the lasting impression that they left in this one role.   But this is about 714 and reasons I like the number. It used to be the number stamped on Qualudes, which to my knowledge I have never taken. Downers never were something I associated with fun.  It was funny to watch people who took them as a recreational drug at a party though because they would always be falling down and stuff.  I like when people fall down in a funny way. One time this woman I worked with in a hospital kitchen fell down on a grease spot while holding a big scoop of flour that flew into the air creating this huge cloud. No one could tell if she was allright at first because of the cloud then she emerged just covered in this flour so she looked a little like the pillsbury doughboy. We could not help but laugh and when she got to the mirror she did too.  I also saw this guy, who had been taking down the grease traps, step on the shelf of the deep fat fryer (it was not on, so no hot grease)and flip it over and then fall repeately as he tried to escape from the pool of grease.  That was pretty funny as well.    My first address was 704 but I always told people it was 714. I was not lying I just always forgot and knew it started with 7 and ended in 4.  I also like counting by sevens aspect of it and would probably also like 71,421 if a needed to pick a 5 digit number or if I could ever get 714-2128 as a phone number I would feel pretty darn special.

      I was almost finished. Ten more minutes and I would have been long gone. They didn't look like the kind of people that would be capable of the kind of stupidity they exhibited. A normal looking dude, his sister and a friend of hers.  The friend went over and put some songs and came back and the guy said he didn't know why she bothered they would probably be gone by the time her songs came on. Then "Hello, I love You" came on and the dude says, Man I hate the Doors, they are such a copycat band, have you ever noticed how all their songs sound like somebody else.  The girl said no she hadn't and that she kind of liked them. He proceeded to say how they sounded like this band or that band and I could not help thinking what a dweeb he was since most of the bands he named did not begin recording until after the Doors.  He then went on to say how he really hated how bassy they sounded.  I was getting up to leave anyway so as I passed the dude I punched him straight down on top of his head, which made him bite off a small piece of his tounge.  He and his companions just sat stunned and so I payed and left with my pal Cheese.  When we got to the car Cheese said, I don't know why you punched that guy, you freaking hate the Doors.  I said, I know but I hate them for the right reason.

      Today I painted. At first I had this mix of paints that looked ,ike metalic baby poop. It was a bad color to smear on a house. Then Silo and Kim showed up with lots of white paint and I covered it up.

      That is what I told her but she just kept right on talking. She ask me how it was possible that I could have found it in it's place and then claim not to recall where that place was when it came time to put it up. I suggested that it could be like a specific mental disability, kind of the opposite of Obsessive Compulsive disorder, forgettin of course her freakish brother who counts that as one of his 9 mental conditions.  I could apologize but what is the point, the fact is I said it because it was funny to me and it did in fact make me laugh (inside my head). That was the last actually conversation we had and now I sit in an empty house wondering if maybe "because I thought it sounded funny" isn't a good enough reason to say something out loud.

      One of the jobs I have had in my life was a bartender/bouncer/cook at a little dive in Maryville.&nbsp; My favorite trick, as a bouncer, was to redirect the drunks anger towards me and then invite them outside to settle things.&nbsp; I would walk them to the back door and say let's go out here and settle it and then swing the door open. They would step out and fall the 3 feet to the ground and as they scrambled to get up I would point to the Police station and say you might want to take off because as you can see they don't have far to go to come get you.  The game at  urlLink www.wagenschenke.ch &nbsp; is kind of like that.  Thanks to Kim S. for sending it to me.

      Everyone showed up on time and we headed over to the dog pound.  My plan had been simple.  We would get there before anyone came to work set all the dogs free and get out.  Then each of us would go home and stay in the house the rest of the morning so we would have an alibi.  When we approached the fenced area of the pound I knew things would not go that smooth.  The information PK gave me about the pound failed to mention a couple of key things. There were two fences about a foot apart.  I guess that was so the dogs would have to dig 2 holes to get out.  I thought we would be able to just pull the fence up and out the dogs would go.  I also hadn’t realized that the main reason that PK wanted to free these dogs was that there was a liter of seven beagle puppies.  Puppies that I knew Spider, Ronny, PK and even me would not be able to just walk away from once they were free.  I told Ronny and Spider to pull up on the fence and PK and I would try and lift the second fence.  I had my arms under the first fence and was pulling up on the second one but couldn’t get a good grip.  I moved left so I could get pulling room and knocked Spider’s legs out from under him.  The first fence came down hard on the top of my arms, cutting the left one and scrapping the right one.  I rolled away from the fence and told PK to throw his coat over the top of the fence and then we will throw Spider over the fence.  Once inside the dog pen Spider started throwing the puppies over the fence one at a time.  When all the dogs were out I realized that Spider couldn’t climb out.  He was starting to get a little freaked because PK had told Ronny to head back to the fort.  He then told me to think of something quick because people would be waking up soon.  I looked around and noticed for the first time that the dog pen had a gate that was also a door to the pound building.  I told Spider to try the gate and it opened right up and he ran through the building and out the front door to safety.  We ran all the way back to the fort and Ronny was rolling around on the ground playing with the puppies.  The alibi part of the plan was blown.  We had taken to much time and none of else really wanted to leave the puppies.  We named them all and found food for them and generally spent all day taking care of our rescued friends.  If any of us tried to leave a puppy would follow them.  There was no way to hide them without tying them up and since we had just freed them we couldn’t do that.  So instead Ronny went to his house and stole a ham out of the refrigerator. His family always had stuff like a whole ham in the fridge.  We left while the puppies were devouring the ham and all headed home.   	The next day we all showed up at the fort early.  The puppies had pretty much just gone to sleep after their ham feast.  We decide that the heat was off and it wouldn’t look suspicious if we were seen with a dog or two following us around so we headed out.  We decided not to hang out together to make it look a little better.  We were all reunited at the Sheriff’s office later that day.  I guess it did look odd to be followed around by puppies.  We were each put in a jail cell for and for an hour no one spoke to us.  It was sort of scary but mostly I thought about the puppies.  The Sheriff would probably kill them so nobody else would try and set them free.  I knew that PK and Ronny would do there “Yes sir, I am so sorry, you are so right,” routine.  They had that perfected since fourth grade but Spider would just start crying and you never could be sure what he might let slip out in between sobs.  We couldn’t see or hear each other and then the Sheriff would pull one of us out and lecture each of us about the dangers of rabies and how we could have been seriously hurt.  I got sent back to the cell for asking the Sheriff which of the puppies had rabies.  When he came back and asked if I had anything else smart to say I said no and ask him how long he was going to hold me before he charged me with a crime. Then after another hour he ask me if I had any other smart things to say and I told him no and so he let me go as well.  I thought about what I would say to my parents when I got home and kept wondering what would happen to the puppies.  When I did arrive I realized quickly that the Sheriff had not called my Mom or Dad meaning I could risk forgetting about it. It had always been my philosophy to never volunteer information to grown ups.   	I never knew what became of the pups or why the Sheriff hadn’t called but always imagined him taking all of the dogs home with him.  It was easier to imagine then thinking he had them all put down. I mean after all he did let me off the hook.

      Things were quiet as I approached the Fort.  I could smell that oily fire smell that let me know that Spider had built the fire.  I ask him once why he always used a plastic oil bottle to start a fire and he just shrugged his shoulders.  You got that a lot from the Spider, a shrug that told you he not only had never questioned why he did things the way he did but also sort of ask if there was another way he should try to do it.  I showed him how to build a fire with paper, dried grass, and sticks last week so I didn’t feel like another lesson was necessary.  I just decided I’d warn everybody not to cook anything for a couple of hours.  Ronny almost always brought something to cook; he seemed to need to eat every couple of hours.  Spider and I were the only ones at the Fort.  I ask him if he knew where anyone was and he said PK and Ronny were seeing a man about a dog.  In our world that had always meant you were taking a pee ever since we had heard Ollie over at the Phillips 66 say that whenever he headed to the john. Since I couldn’t see them anywhere I said what dog.  Spider told me that they were really seeing about some dog.  I decided to wait until they showed up rather than decipher Spider’s thoughts.  I climb up above the Fort and laid on the long branch that ran out towards the creek.  I love this tree I thought, I can easily see anyone approaching. And if they aren’t friendly I can climb up and out of sight before anyone can spot me.   	I was dozing when the unmistakable sound of Ronny’s excited “OmanOmanOman” snapped me awake.  PK and Ronny were on their way up to the Fort.  I saw Spider was still poking at his fire so I jumped down to greet them.  PK was happy to see me and immediately said we got a big one to plan out.  I was thinking not another water balloon raid when PK said “We have to plan a jail break.”  Now this was the kind of big job that watching all those crime stories had prepared me for.  So I immediately started asking questions.  Who, where, when my mind was swimming.  PK said to sit down and he’d lay out all the details.  This was a big one all right.  I was to bust a total of 15 prisoners out of their temporary confinement.  This sounded to big until I realized he wasn’t talking people and jail but instead dogs and the pound.  I set about planning and declared that tomorrow morning 7:00 sharp we would meet here.

      I came down to the Fort on Friday following the last day of school water balloon fight that always took place at the park.  Every kid knew that you could make your reputation at the park if you were brave in battle.  All of the high school kids had been hanging around drinking and smoking weed and stuff and I was with a group of seventh graders who had planned on attacking the high schoolers before they could get their troops organized.  It was an epic battle.  Little did we know that they were well prepared and the surprise attack only gave us an advantage for about two minutes.  We rushed in and started bombing away screaming “High School losers never made with the ladies” it was part of a line from an Aerosmith song.  We had no real plan after the initial attack.  I knew almost instantly that the plan wouldn’t go anywhere because we didn’t even have any water balloon reserves.  It was a suicide mission but I had to pretend it was an honor to be included with the older kids.  PK always wanted me to plan most of our capers and thought I should learn what other kids did to get ready for these kinds of big things.  The water balloon fight was a classic example, he had found out the sneak attack was on from T-Smith, a seventh grade friend of his from the convent days, and told me to be near the south entrance to the park just hanging around after school.  Like I said their wasn’t any thought put to what to do after we hit them with the initial onslaught but no matter my own plan was to escape through the West gate and then climb the old oak tree and just watch the seventh graders get caught one by one by the enraged high school losers. I would be thought to be brave just because a sixth grader had never even showed up before. As I had predicted to myself the battle was over quick, the high school kids had trunks full of balloons and water guns and every other imaginable kind of water weapon.  I watched from the tree until things quieted down and then I climbed down and headed for Fort Lima.

      I have very rarely enjoyed shopping. Sometimes I liked it as a kid and sometimes I like going to thrift stores but generally I have never really loved it.  I have though always had this mental image that occasionally pops up in dreams and sometimes even in daydreams.  It is one of me shopping joyfully. I walk down the aisles tossing this and  that into a big cart, a tune by Pancho Sanchez is playing and every move I make is in time with the music, all the other shoppers are also choreographed so turns at the end of the aisles are very breathtaking. It really is sort of like a big dance number where everybody is happy and carefree. I have I realize seen this in films at least once but never like I vision it inside my head. Sometimes I wish life seemed more like that where everyone seemed happy and danced around to a tropical beat that perpetually played in their head.   Maybe that is what Brazil is like because the pop music from there always seems so happy. Even the more downtempo stuff from that culture has this underlying feeling of relaxed joy.

      Our fort was built from scrap wood we swiped from the construction sight just across the creek.  We had hauled the pieces down by the railroad tracks every day.  PK had picked this location because it was on the land owned by the convent and he knew the nuns never did come around there.  On one side there was a hill running up about twenty feet to the tracks, the creek was on the other side, surrounding the rest of the fort were pine trees and other scrub brush.  We called the place Fort Lima because that was part of the convent name. The Sisters of Saint Rose of Lima, PK had lived at the convent since first grade until his Dad got out of jail.  That had only been a year or so ago.  PK never would tell us why his Dad had been in jail or for that matter where his Mom was.  PK was the official leader because in the first week he got to town he had beat up each of us.  We built the fort so that we all could have a place to go with no big brothers, no little sisters, and mostly no adults telling us what to do.  Ronny, Spider, PK, and me The Kingfish had been friends since the first grade. PK had bright red hair it seemed almost orange in the bright sun, he was the only redheaded kid I knew that didn’t have any freckles.  Ronny was kind of slow witted but he was strong.  People always thought he was sweet when they first met him but he was mean.  He had a little brother that he used to lock in a closet and put Pink Floyd’s  “Dark Side of the Moon” on the record player, which really seemed to freak his little brother out.  Spider’s Mom was really old, he had 4 older brothers but none of them had lived at home since 1972, so Spider pretty much had been on his own for 3 years.  He was kind of a runt, we always made him act lost if we needed a distraction in a public place because people thought he was six and could throw a good little tantrum if he wasn’t tended to.

      When you are the youngest of five children you often relish the opportunities that being alone can provide. One of the craziest years of my life was the year that my parents decided to lease a hotel and act as managers. One of the great things was that each of the kids got to have a room of their own and we also got to move around as vacancy allowed. My favorite TV show back then was Manix, it was a typical detective show that for some reason or another the star got wet in every episode. Sometimes he fell off a dock or boat and other times it was just like a drink spilled on himself. Anyway on one rare occasion I was laying on the floor in the TV room all alone watching Manix and this fairly large cockroach comes staggering out across the floor towards me. I watched it struggle along the floor and then remembered the exterminators had been there that day and the roach was probably dying. Just as this thought came to me the roach circled around then rolled over and then after a few seconds of leg twitching headed off to wherever roaches go when they die. I examined the roach a little while and decided I could get a lot better view if I were to pick it up with my toes and hold it over my face. I did and was studying the roach quite intently when I thought I felt it squirm and so I dropped it. Remember it was right over my face so I ended up dropping it into my right eye. My eye instantly started feeling like I had poured some acid in it and I ran to the bathroom to wash it out. My eye began to swell and eventually I could see nothing out of it. My right eye is still weaker than my left and I will always blame that roach.

      Just do it, Ted it isn’t really that far to the water.  I said feeling much like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. If you jump I will too. We could not jump together because the river below was only deep enough in a spot about 4 foot wide.  Ted just kept saying no and looking down at the water, so I climbed up on the rail and jumped right past him.  Falling down towards the water I thought to myself that next time I should sit and push myself off because the iron rail thing could cut my foot up.  I then splashed into the water feeling like the coolest guy at the river that day. Oh sure we had all seen Bruce doing the backflips off the same bridge but he was 17 which made him cooler than us in about 500 ways anyway. Today I would be king, first one to jump always had that honor.  So as I climbed back up to the top Ted and his brother Tom both jumped but we all knew who had been first.  When I got back up on the bridge I sat down to think about how to avoid the foot thing that I had worried about.  Tom was slow to make his way out of the river and for a second I thought he might have been hurt.  I yelled down at him and he said he just wanted to swim around a minute and I told him that he better watch out or I might jump on him.  That got him out of the way and headed back up to the bridge.  When they both got back up to the bridge they were talking about how they were debating whether or not they should try and do a dive next time.  They knew I would not dive and therefore could steal my royal title.  I haven’t been able to dive since I saw that Shoemaker kid split his head open coming of the high dive at the pool.  I had been just ahead of him in line and had done a 1 and a half with ease.  Then he came behind me trying to splash the lifeguards chair with a watermelon dive (think cannonball headfirst) and had caught the pools edge about 6 inches below the water line but with plenty of speed to put about a gallon of blood in the water. So anyway I could never dive again after I saw that. I could sometimes do a flip but I had to land feet first.  Ted and Tom were now both on the bridge and were almost up to me and I decided I would just push myself off from a sitting position to stay ahead of them and avoid the diving discussion all together.  I waited until they were about 5 feet away and pushed off as hard as I could.  I was expecting to feel that rush of air that comes at the start of a jump but instead all I felt was my underwear tearing up the crack of my ass at a speed greater then any wedgie ever conceived. I then started to swing around towards the bridge and could see I was literally hanging from a nail sticking out of the wood plank I had been sitting on. Just as I reached out to grab onto the bridge my underwear tore free and I started to fall.  I knew that I was no longer over the sweet spot and was instead heading for the area that had the rocks a foot or two below the surface.  My mind raced through options until quite suddenly I felt my foot begin to turn a complete circle and my knee hit me right in the mouth.  Then nothing. A floating feeling and a very bright light, am I dead I wondered.  Then things started coming back into focus and I realized I was floating in the river staring up at the sun.  The only sound that could be heard was laughter interrupted occasionally with comments like “Did you see his face” and “he was just hanging there” then more laughter.  I tried to swim forward and realized that my leg was very seriously messed up so I yelled up at Tom and Ted but everything I said just brought more laughter.  I drug myself from the river with my forearms and all the way up the bank.  I felt like I somehow was the original ancestor who crawled from the water and forever changed us into a land  based species.  I was delirious from the pain in my leg as I crawled into the back of the Buick and waited until Tom or Ted would come over and check on me and realize I needed medical attention.  I must have passed out for awhile because the next thing I recall is being helped out of the car at my house.  I knew my Mom would freak because I was covered in mud and not supposed to be swimming at the river so I had them carry me inside and put me in the tub.  Mom was not due home for another hour at least so I washed off the mud and took a good look at my ankle.  I had never seen skin that many colors before or swelling quite like that.  I tried to get out of the tub but found it impossible and so just sat back down and waited.  The x-rays later showed that my leg was broken in a spiral that started at the foot and wrapped around twice before it got to the knee.  I told the Doctor the same thing I told my Mom, I had fallen out of a treehouse.
