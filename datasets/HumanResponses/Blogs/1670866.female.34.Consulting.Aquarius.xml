      Oh my god!!!! I did it!  I passed my SANS GSNA exam!  I have never felt so empowered... so secure!  Life is wonderful!  On the Bailey front... 5 months old and got her last puppy shots yesterday.  Two more puppy teeth to go and she will be over the teething stage.  She rolled in dead fishguts yesterday to celebrate and I spent the evening bathing her and cleaning anything that had touched her.  She is very pleased with herself.    Just like me.

      This is our new diary.  I am a divorced woman in a roller coaster job who has found inspiration in my new puppy.  Bailey (the puppy) is a beagle/dauchsund mix who is 5 months old and 11 pounds big.  I want to personally thank her for taking a scared, anxious, bored woman and showing her that life is about having treats, long walks in the park in the evenings and snuggling.    I thought I would use this blog to explore the thoughts in my head as Bailey and I take life one day at a time.  A little background...  Two years ago in California, I left my husband of 6 years because I realized that I was no longer in love, and more then likely had never been in love.  I was in a job that I hated and in a desperate act of self distruction, I left my marriage and my job with no place to go and no prospects.  A friend of a friend offerred me a job if I would move to DC.  It was a new city, doing a job I had never done before, alone for the first time.  I became very sick and had to be put on medication just to be able to leave the house.  I never thought I would make it.  But here I am almost two years later and I am much stronger then I ever thought I could be.  I am very good at my new job and am making more money then I ever thought I would make and possibly more then I am worth.  I will have my last credit card paid off at the end of this month and overall my finances are stable.  However, I found that I was still very scared and lonely.  I had tried making friends and dating without much success.  Then, three months ago, I got my little dog.  She has given me so much.  She gets me up in the morning and takes me out to Starbucks for coffee.  She sleeps with me at night, which makes my king size bed feel much smaller and cozy.  She takes me to the park every day for long walks, or swims in the river and has introduced me to many new, kind people.  She makes me feel loved and safe and happy.  This is my thank you to her for being here and coming into my life and giving me the gift of her love.

      It has been a very busy week.  I am in a boot camp training class for my CISSP.  The material isn't all that hard, but there is so much to know.  I am scheduled to take the test on the 22nd and I hope that I pass.  I am very pleased to be getting to know my instructor.  His name is Eric Cole and has been in security for his entire professional life.  He is very impressive and I am hoping that I can possibly use him as a mentor.   I forgot to mention that I got my breast reduction surgery two months ago last tuesday.  I am very happy and healing well.  I feel so much better about the way I look and I feel like I have gained a new sense of confidence.  Work is the same as always.  Part of me is stressed that I am going to lose my job and the other part thinks that they can't do it without me.  I get so much positive feedback from my bosses, but I guess there is just a part of me that thinks there must be something else going on.  I am going to have a conference call with the owner of the company next week to discuss some of the issues going on out here and to make sure he knows that I am not still having panic attacks.   I have been trying to go out on a few dates, but still haven't found Mr. Right.  I will keep my fingers crossed.

      Ok.&nbsp; Time for an update.   Bailey is awesome and she and I have become very good friends with a wonderful girl named Kelly who also has a wonderful dog named Mila.&nbsp; Mila and Bailey love each other and are so funny to watch together, though I think at times Mila gets more then a little tired of Bailey always hanging from her neck.   No real news on the dating front.&nbsp; I have gone out with a few men, but they all pretty much sucked.&nbsp; So I am back to being single again, which is just as well.   I am back on my panic meds.&nbsp; I had some trouble attending a couple of meetings and I decided it was time to try to get help again.&nbsp; Turns out that I am more likely suffering from a social phobia, rather then a panic disorder.&nbsp; Hopefully that is more easily corrected.   The job is as it has always been.&nbsp; Sometimes stressful, other times boring.&nbsp; My finances are shaping up and I have purchased my first home.&nbsp; All in all, life is going very well and I feel happy.&nbsp; Now I just need to find someone to share it all with.

People with this disorder often feel inadequate, avoid social situations, and seek out jobs with little contact with others. They are fearful of being rejected and worry about embarassing themselves in front of others. They exaggerate the potential difficulties of new situations to rationalize avoiding them. Often, they will create fantasy worlds to substitute for the real one. Unlike schizoid personality disorder, avoidant people yearn for social relations yet feel they are unable to obtain them. They are frequently depressed and have low self-confidence.   Hell.. what can I say.  That is pretty much me.

      Well, it is friday and I made it.  I did two meetings this week that both went very well.  Everything is going according to schedule and my clients love me.  Les is awsome and I am so glad I have him on my team.  Now I just need to get him some help.  I did need to sedate myself for one of the meetings due to panic, but I actually talked to my client about the fact that I was having the attacks and he was so incredibly supportive.  I love working with him and hope that I can always work with him, even if I leave Breakwater in the future.  Not that I see any reason to do that for quite a while.  I am very happy with my job even though it does stress me out sometimes.  Life is looking pretty good going into the weekend.

      How do you live when life, just normal life, becomes more then you can handle?  Today I had one of my clients complain about my companies service.  It is my job to make sure the clients are happy and now I have to attend a meeting first thing in the morning to try to fix things and I am completely freaked out.  I wish I could just turn off the fear.  It is the fear itself that is going to ruin my life if I can't get it under control!  I just want to be normal and live a happy life like everyone else.

      Back at work and I have so many things that I have to do that I am losing my mind a little. I keep getting started and then feeling overwhelmed and I stall. I need a pep talk and I need to hire one or two more folks to work with me out here so I can focusing on managing things.  I'm going to have a conference call with the owner of the company tomorrow to discuss the federal division and some of the problems that I see. I hope it goes well. I have to get the idea out of my head that my job is in danger when there is nothing to worry about. Deep breaths.  Online dating is a strange thing. I am currently corresponding with a man who is very intelligent, successful and funny. He also has beautiful blue eyes. So far I like everything that I know about him. But we have never met and I am trying not to get my hopes up that I will really like him because it has been way too long since I have really liked anyone. Kelly says I am due to meet a nice guy. I hope she is right.
