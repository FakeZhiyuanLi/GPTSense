      I'm not sure if this blog thing is working.   I haven't seen the same kind of chatter that I'm accustomed to.  Is email a better venue to converse?  I don't know but the response that the blogs have gotten so far has been limited.  Comments?

      You've probably heard about the troop redeployment plans, but if not you can learn more here:  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3568548.stm   Seems to me like a sneaky ploy (but doesn't everything Bush does now-a-days?). Claim you are bringing home the troops - but only pull them out from cooler spots in the world, and stagger it over 10 years. Claim you are doing it because you care about military families, drawing attention away from benefit cuts to the troops. Meanwhile, use stop-gap orders to keep people from leaving the service, and override the 1 year tour of duty in Iraq to keep people there for as long as necessary. If troop increases become necessary in the future to stabilize Iraq (a real possibility), then pull fresh troops from the States to fill the gap - and postpone such a development until after the election. By all means, keep anybody who is currently in Iraq now from coming home before the election, so they can't tell anybody about how very fucked up things really are over there.  Sound like a close approximation of the plan?

      I listened to NPR on Wednesday and a commentator said there was speculation that Ali Sistani the leader of the majority of the Shia in Iraq was not in London because of heart problems.  It would appear that his heart condition was a ruse to get him out of Iraq in attempt to prevent him from having to act as middle-man between the Sadr and the Iraqi(US) gov.  The fear was that Sadr would take up residence in his house and force Sistani to negotiate on Sadr's behalf.   This morning, in interview with Larry King, W. was asked about the political divide in this country that seams to have grown significantly since he was elected.  W said "I don't have a sense there is a lot of anger."  What kind of sheltered world is our President living in.  Every step he takes and everything he witnesses are carefully scripted.  Unlike Clinton, who I beleive was very much in step with the country, W. could be campaigning in Siberia and he wouldn't know a difference.

      More bad economic news today - US trade deficit grows by 19% in June due to a large drop in exports. ( urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3562552.stm )  Add to that poor job figures, and the price of oil hitting new record highs every day, it collectively spells big trouble. Having a relatively secure job, and not being a big consumer, before I was thinking of the economy mostly in terms of what political damage / advantage it would bring to Bush. Now I'm starting to really worry about it's fundamental health, and that we might be headed for worse.

      Have any of you seen the new MoveOn ad contest? It's called  Real People , and they're going to try to get the winning ad aired during the RNC. Interesting tactic, as I don't see a 30-second spot changing anyone's mind. Then again, maybe it would depend on the mind. I watched the 17 finalists, and they all seemed pretty similar, message-wise. I could see the 1st-place ad having more impact, maybe, because it's a recently-returned Marine talking about the lack of WMDs. I guess since my mind has been made up forever, though, they don't really have an impact on me. Any thoughts?

      Moore embarrasses new CIA chief  urlLink http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3560484.stm   Hahahaha! In his own words, on film no less. Could you ask for a more embarassing set of quotes?  The White House calls the quotes "ridiculous hearsay".  However, they seem to have a different idea of the word "hearsay" than the dictionary:  1: Unverified information heard or received from another; rumor. 2: (in law) Evidence based on the reports of others rather than the personal knowledge of a witness and therefore generally not admissible as testimony.

      This article lays out what I find to be a pretty convincing argument that terror warnings and "terror preparedness" rallys are occurring completely based on the Republican campaign needs. Opinions?  September Surprise  urlLink http://alternet.org/election04/19535/
