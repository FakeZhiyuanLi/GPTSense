       urlLink A History of the Canon XL1 and XL1S Camcorders  Published in  urlLink Camcorderinfo.com  During their six and a half years of existence, the XL1 and the XL1S have had a greater effect on the low-budget independent filmmaking community than any technology since the invention of digital video. From its unique design to its image acquistion system, Canon engineered the original XL1 to be a versatile and special camcorder from the ground up. The versatility of the XL1 and XL1S have allowed them to be developed, adapted, and used like no other consumer or prosumer digital video camcorder in the entire history of digital video. The Canon XL1 was introduced on October 23, 1997, and made its way to consumers first in January 1998.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink Mi2N - Music Industry News Network  Published in  urlLink Mi2n.com  The 2004 Temecula Valley International Film & Music Festival (TVIFMF) is proud to announce honorees R&amp;B icon, Lou Rawls for the Lifetime Achievement Award and Film Composer (former YES guitarist), Trevor Rabin to be presented an Outstanding Career Achievement Award at the annual Awards Gala , 6 p.m. on Sunday, September 12, 2004 at Wilson Creek Winery (35960 Rancho California Rd., Temecula).

      On August 6th, Altar Magazine will bring award-winning filmmaker Maggie Hadleigh-West to the Pioneer Theater in NYC to discuss her controversial documentary War Zone, a film about the street harassment of women.   This provocative film is about sex, power and what happens when men—either knowingly or unknowingly—threaten a woman’s right to walk undisturbed on the streets. Hadleigh-West takes to the streets, turning her camera on men in the same way that they turn their aggression on her. She places herself in very real danger by daring to ask the men on the streets why they are treating a complete stranger in a sexual way. Hadleigh-West combines her explosive feature length film, War Zone with a titillating discussion that leaves the audience questioning their own behavior, as well as a society that condones this kind of aggression towards women. Through conversations on the street and with the audience, Hadleigh-West reveals the anger, fear and frustration as well as the affection, admiration and humor that characterizes relationships between men and women.   Each attendee will receive a gift bag full of prizes and promotional materials from our sponsors.   The film will begin at 6pm. Tickets are $7 pre-paid and $9 at the door. To buy tickets, go to www.AltarMagazine.com. Space is limited.   For more information visit:   WAR ZONE   urlLink www.filmfatale.com    ALTAR MAGAZINE   urlLink www.altarmagazine.com    PIONEER THEATER  155 East 3rd Street (at Ave. A)  New York, NY 10009   urlLink www.twoboots.com/pioneer    Thanks and we hope you will join us for this exciting event!
