      This is what i want to write about.  i like this realm...i can be creative i can create my own world.  i can create humans or aliens...you notice how in most books about a galaxy far far away, there are always human or human like being that look like us and speak english haha.  i know they have too or the book would really suck.  i know i'm not getting very far with this idea of a book, but i'm moving this week and well i'm focusing on that.  i did have an idea for a memory eraser. like in MIB or paycheck but you know what has been done. obviously! it's too hard to come up with new ideas that will revolutionize the genre right.  i mean there is so much that has already been done...from alternate universes to the night of the living dead haha.  okay moving on.  so my main character needs work, my plot and story needs work...guess what i've got nothing so far. sigh!

      what do i name my main character, i know you might be like just pick a name but it has to have meaning, it has to serve a purpose, i mean come on if harry potters name was chris o'hare, i don't think it would have the same catch.  i was thinking jason sword, but i can't use that, too much like jason bourne.  can't use alex...sigh...name name name...krystal sword, krys sword...hmmm...i didn't say it had to be a guy, and if you find a girls name that mirrors a guys name she can use that to her advantage.  sword for a last name might not be the best...cummings bj cummings...haha okay mind went straight to the gutter.  i'll work on the name things.  now plot...in a galaxy far far away...haha yeah that's not copyrighted.  sigh, alternate universes. or a future that now one has predicted yet.  okay i need to work on it all haha.  okay i need my sleep more to come...yeah i know i'm not getting far.

      i was thinking, what i do might influence my book...that may or may not be a good thing. i am a scientist.  i love science, i am also a christian...many would think that those things don't go together but they do.  science is just the search for God, or to show how great he really is.  you may not agree with my views, but that's okay i know who i am and hopefully you know who you are. so who will my main character be.  probably something i'm not, see this is my fantasy world, here i can be everything and nothing all at the same time.  i have a fascination with scifi, more than that space.  i know, i know not many popular scifi books out there, though i must say micheal chriton does a good job.  plot, setting, all things i need to think of....the rain is starting...yeah i love rain, great to sleep too, there were tornado warnings all evening, and i don't even live in the mid west or whatever. i mean it's NY baby...no not the city...you know there is this giant state...but everyone only thinks of the city.  okay i got off the subject of the main character...but that's all i have for now just the thought of who he or she will be.

      so if you were wondering about the title it's a reference to the pen is mightier than the sword...just in today technology the pen is a computer keyboard.  So what i plan on doing on this blog is a log of brain storming.  i'm looking to write a novel and i'm need some creative space to try out my ideas and characters.  i'm thinking of doing something that is more a chronicle.  one main character.  this character will be in all the books(if i choose to write more than one) that i have.  the character will become a part of me be in me in my life in my soul.  this is my blog for my book.  i have other blogs but this one is for my creative spirit the dwells inside, and want to be released.  so in the coming days, months, years.  you'll see me write updates and brainstorms here about what i'm planning to do.  so if you one day find yourself reading my book, you can come back and see how the process got started.  i am in no way a literary genius and at best i can probably only come up with some thing mediocre but we will see.  if you don't try then how do you know you couldn't do it right.  so be ready, so of the things you may read might be really off in a way, i can have a vivid imagination and one of the things i can vividly imagine is killing someone.  i think that is a curse not a gift.  but i'm sure you'll see this reflected in the stories that i will tell.  i'm not looking to make a homicide mystery so don't think that.  i'm looking for more of something scifi...maybe, i haven't decided yet this is what the blog is for.  you know strange thing.  i'm using my coworkers laptop and i really want one of these things.  wow are they nice.  but i have a new car to budget for so we will see.  okay i think i'm done for now expect more...so much more, because i really want to write a book, i have a drive...now i just have to stick with it.
