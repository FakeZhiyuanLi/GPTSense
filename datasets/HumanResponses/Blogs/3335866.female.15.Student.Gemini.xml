       Lurvely  day today. Skipped school (though not in the traditional way), got a great new book, actually got some homework done and spent time with my mom. Oh, and I'm still blogging! Things are definitely looking up. Also, my room is still clean. How weird is that?   Still trying to stick to the significant stuff and for today that'd be the missed school. I've only ever skipped school in the normal way once, and even then I just ended up hiding in my bedroom. (My mom caught me when I came down to pee though, so that doesn't exactly count.) However, my  variation  on school-skipping occurs much more often. It's rather like what Henna used to do all the time. Emphasis on the past tense; she insists that she's all clean now. Uh, sure. Whatever. Anyway, for her missing school is necessary whenever her mom needs her for something essential, like shopping or as company to a doctor's appointment. For me, it's when I'm tired or stressed or just want an extra day to catch up on homework. It's quite simple actually. All I have to do is persuade my mother to let me stay home from school. Since both Henna and me are on best-friend status with our mummies, it's easier than it sounds. It's not exactly manipulation though; if my mom insists on my going I will. However, I'd say that when I try to get out of school there's a 2:1 chance, in my favor, that I'll get my way. All of this is the easy part.   My dad is my mom's opposite on discipline issues. Since she knows my sister and I so well, she's inclined to be a bit lax, while my dad doesn't like to let anything slip by. This means that my mom'll often go behind his back to let us do what we want, like watching TV 'til 11 or missing school. I know this sounds like crap parenting, but your friends wouldn't want to be mean to you, right? Just think of it that way. So anyway, whenever I stay home from school I have to hide from my dad. It's a huge adrenaline rush, way scary, and I would love it if I was that sort of person. But, as I'm not, I hate it. And he catches me 3/4 of the time. That was what happened today.   My mom went upstairs to get Ian (my brother) ready for school, with the promise that she'd be back out soon. I chose to ignore her advice to come in, and instead scrunched up in the bottom of the truck, positive that my mom would be out soon and my dad wouldn't see me even if he did leave before my mom. (He usually goes to work around 11 am; he owns his own business. He works 'til like 1 in the morning though; that's how we can do things behind his back. I feel kind of bad about it, but who would act any differently given the opportunity to do as they pleased?) So anyway, there I was in the bottom of the truck. God, I can be so stupid. Sometimes the truth is so unpleasant that I can make myself believe something completely ridiculous just so I won't have to face the facts. I mean, he walks right past that truck on the way to the car! How could he  not  see me?   So I'm scrunched down and I look up through the window and there he is, angry as hell. This is the part where I start panicking. All I remember is sticking my fingers in my ears, closing my eyes, and thinking  Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit . It was the scariest thing ever. I'm not sure how much time passed, but the next thing I knew my dad was back, yelling (though with my fingers in my ears I couldn't really hear) and shaking the truck a bit. Later my mom told me that in the time that'd passed he'd come upstairs and yelled at her. I ended up opening the truck door and making a run for the house, bookbag in tow. I left my shoes behind though. Once upstairs I started crying hysterically and asking my mom what happened and how did he find out? I am such a wimp. I got exactly what I deserved for being so deceitful. Whatever. It turned out okay anyway. He forgave me, I think; at least he hasn't mentioned it since I've been home.   I ended up going to work with my mom (two  hours  later). She maintains gardens downtown. I didn't end up getting much homework done though. My mom spent the day showing around this visitor from the UK, so I was talking with them, and then later I got lunch with my mom and talked with her. I did okay though. I should really be in bed now, seeing as I have to get up in like 7 hours and I only got 5 hours of sleep last night, but I guess I'm gonna have to sacrifice for this thing. And considering that not one person besides myself has yet seen my blog that's pretty pathetic, but whatever.   Currently Reading:  Peops  by Fly. My mom and I disagreed on how to pronounce this book's title. I said 'pee-yops' while she insisted that it was simply 'peeps'. She's probably right, but I don't really think the author would care one way or another. It's basically a series of rough sketches of random people/friends of the author that are surrounded by bits of conversations the author had with them. They're lovely little slices of life. The ones of children are the best; while the adults are tough, punk-ish people, the children are adorable and talk about things like their loose teeth and tests. It's like a breath of fresh air. I'd recommend this book if you like my blog at least a tiny bit, if you like comics at least a little bit, and if you're open-minded and not offended by swearing.   Less than 24 hours until I reach Java Junkie heaven!

      Okay. It's blog #5 now, and the realization is officially setting in. Even for someone like me, who has no life to speak of, it's impossible to report on every single slightly significant thing that happens. I'm just going to have to stick to the most significant and/or interesting stuff and leave it at that. If I don't I'll probably end up developing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. I think. What is that, anyway? Must ask medically-knowledgeable-BF-numero-dos. (I'm just now introducing her. Her name's Henna by the way.)   Okay, so, I'm going to stick to the most important stuff. For today that'd probably be the two disgusting websites I saw. They weren't dirty in a pornographic way, but they were possibly more offensive than if they had been. You can check them out at  urlLink gothamist  and  urlLink ProBush . Seriously. Isn't there enough repressive propaganda hateful crap in other countries without insisting on it in the world's center of 'tolerance' and 'democracy' as well? I suppose that this is the downside of free speech. I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but sometimes the stupidity of Americans shocks me. 'Tree hugger hate mail'? Do they claim that it's unreasonable to care about the environment? As a child with fiercely liberal parents, who grew up picking up trash, planting trees, being a white minority and fixing up houses, it just seems that the selfishness is shocking. As for the other thing; well, that's just part of the fart-jokes category. It's stupid and disgusting and part of that big group of idiotic testosterone humor.   My mom and dad have just come back from a jaunt to Massachusetts. I've been cleaning my room (again) and doing the dishes and now it's 11:14 where I am and I'm tired but I really want to succeed with this. God, am I gonna need a lot of coffee in the morning. Also I had to handle the responsibility of tracking down a tape of  Gilmore Girls  and holding the phone up to the TV set so Henna could hear the  Charmed  finale. Poor girl only gets NBC and CBS. Mmph, anything else? Oh yeah- I had a little misadventure on the roof of my house today. This guy we were renting a room to recently moved out, and his room had access to this roof/mini-porch thing where you could hang out. I wanted to go out there to do homework today, and it turned out that getting out there involved lifting this unwieldy 6-foot-tall ultra-heavy wooden cover off the hole you use to get out there. Considering that it was three stories up in the air and there's no barrier to falling off the roof, I was understandably freaked out. So, yeah. I ended up enlisting my sister's (her name is Summer) help in getting it off. No injuries ensued (and the wooden thing didn't even fall of the roof and smush a cat, as I had feared), but there ended up being earwigs and bird poop, so we abandoned the whole thing. Oh, crap. I've just remembered that the cover's still off. Oh well- I'll fix it tomorrow.   Currently Reading:  Stupid White Men  by Michael Moore. This another case of re-reading for the bazillionth time (not literally; duh). I really need to add some new blood (so to speak) to my book collection. Going to go on a jaunt to Borders tomorrow I think. I have some new books in mind. And don't bother lecturing me on the badness of the corporate bookstore- but I suppose that's a subject for another entry.

      I opened the door and screamed. A chicken was on my sister's bed. That's all you need to know. Okay, to clarify, it was our chicken and it wandered up the stairs from the yard (the door was open) but still, man! Imagine, you're just cleaning your room and you open a door to toss in some stuff, and a big chicken gets in your face and clucks at you. Dude- heart attack city.   I forgot to mention some stuff about Friday. The biggest thing happened in homeroom. There's a student-run in-school TV program that airs every morning. They were having this dating show where a girl asked three guys questions and picked one to go out with; to prom, I think. Do you capitalize prom (Prom)? Is it important enough to warrant that? Anyway, she was done asking questions, but the host had to put in his two cents. He said, and I quote, "If [the girl] was an ice cream sundae,  how would you eat her? " You can imagine the answers that ensued. Everyone in my homeroom started cracking up. One of the contestants was this skeevy preppy kid from my grade, and he started talking about working slowly and sensually, and starting at the bottom, and penetrating it with his tongue. He's been reading way too much porn. At this point the girl was so embarrassed that she was covering her face. The other boys responded in kind, but I was trying not to listen at that point. Incidentally, the boy I mentioned was rumored to have had sex on the field trip I rambled about. Wonder if it's true.   After my entry yesterday I watched TV:  Joan of Arcadia  and this PBS special about the crown jewels of England. (Hey, it was cool, and I did say I was a dork.) Sigh. I love the perfect boyfriends of TV and Adam Rove (of  JoA ) is among the best. I mean, they're so sensitive and artistic and sincere, with clear skin and good senses of humor. And if they're really good they never ditch the girl. It was a great episode, though- continuity and everything! That's a major thing missing from, oh, say,  Smallville . (Sorry, pet peeve.)   Today was pretty insignificant, though productive. I have a pattern for Saturdays like this. I wake up late, have late meals, don't change out of PJ's all day, and surf the web until noon. Then my dad wakes up and tells me to clean my room, wash dishes and go outside. I usually take all day to do those things, and then he yells, and I get grounded. I just have a problem concentrating on stuff like that. It takes me literally like 7 hours to do what my dad considers a half-hour clean-up. It went like that today, but I did end up getting most of it done, so that's good. Since I didn't finish I'm officially grounded from the 'net, but I didn't want to stop blogging after I'd been doing so well for two days. Also I wanted to check for  Gilmore Girls  spoilers on  urlLink TWoP . So, anyway, after I cleaned my room and had dinner my dad came upstairs, yelled at me, and made me go outside. I was more upset than usual because I'd spent the whole day outside the day before and it didn't seem necessary to go out. So then I went to the playground near my house and cried because I didn't want to be around him. I was depressed all afternoon because little things were stressing me out- overdue library books, homework, this survey thing I said I would do, peeling paint in my room. Stupid stuff. I'm good now though-  GG  has a way of curing my woes. Hope I dream of Java Junkie goodness tonight!

      Mmmmm. Happy, comfortable, sated, et cetera. Very TGIF. I've spent the last hour or so catching up on old entries on  urlLink pamie.com . Check it out- I'm now officially a fan. Good entry- 'Wonder Killer'; that was the first one I really liked. As the title says, blah blah blah. This is all miscellanous nonsense. It's going to be that sort of entry, I think. I've just read an interview with  urlLink this young author  and am now feeling completely inadequate. I mean, who am I to think I could ever be a writer? How pretentious and forward and assuming is that? I'm not upset- the 'TGIF' description of my mood is much more accurate- I'm just succumbing to the doubtful side of my personality. Young writers are people like Zoe Trope. Cool people. People who like to write all the time. Well-spoken people who are bored with high school. I love high school. I'm loving all my classes. I have a zit-scab on the tip of my nose. I ramble on and on about nothing. I'm pathetic. I start every single sentence I write with 'I'. Okay... will update when mood changes and weather clears.   Today was an unusual day. Field trip. Last night I wanted to watch  Monty Python and the Holy Grail . I'd never seen it before. It was 10 PM. I was only going to watch for a few minutes, but it was fuh-nee as hell. You know those parts in movies/TV where two characters are having a conversation and it's kind of pointless and you zone out? Like when Lana tells Clark to stop with the 'sekrith and lies'. (TM  urlLink TWoP)  Yeah, so when something like that came up in THG I started zoning out. It wasn't until ten minutes into it that I started realizing that there were actually jokes being cracked during those straight-faced exchanges. Okay. All of this will actually relate to my field trip at some point in this narrative.   So, it was 10, and then it was 11, and I was still watching, and by this time I've made some canned raviolis and settled in. I mean, it's just a Friday field trip where we're going to do stupid pointless Biology-class things like seeing how much salt is in the water and looking at starfish and listening to long-winded tour guides. My mom always lets me stay home from things like that, and I was having too much Saturday-type fun (this is what my Saturdays are always like; yep, it's mad fun to be me) to go have Tuesday sleep. Okay, this is turning into 'My Monolauge On My Boring Thursday Night In Which I Didn't Even Watch The  Frasier  Finale'. Long winded much Poire? Did I even have a point with this? I guess this whole thing basically started out because I... I dunno, 'cause I wanted to explain how I almost didn't go on the field trip. This is starting to bore even me, and by now it should be obvious that I just lurve to talk about myself.   Long story short, I was having fun, I didn't want to go to today's (I thought at the time) stupid field trip, I asked my mom if I could just not go, she said yes, my sis got pissed, my mom took it back but then winked at me behind my sister's back (I love my mom), I then got into bed so as not to alert my sister to the deception, I started feeling guilty that my Dad's $14 field trip deposit would go to waste, I started feeling guilty that I was going to ditch my BF (best friend) and Bio teach (after she gave me an extra day to get in my permish slip) and I wasn't even getting to watch the movie though I was getting to catch up on much-needed sleep because I've gotten 6 hrs for three nights in a row, the guilt overwhelmed me, I resolved to go to school, I went to sleep, I got up at 5:30 to go to the gym and I felt like Utter Shit so I had to drink much toffee-flavored coffee, I came home singing 'YMCA' at the top of my lungs and woke sis/dad/my mom's friend who's staying with us and is the one who got THG in the first place, I went on the field trip and had a kick-ass time.   And the award for the longest run-on sentence in the history of ever goes to... Do you even have to ask? Apparently I am incapable of making a long story short. Or maybe I'm just still hyper from the coffee. Or maybe I'm just insane. You tell me.   Okay. TODAY WAS AN UNUSUAL DAY BECAUSE I WENT ON A FIELD TRIP!!! I now resolve to stay on topic. God, I've drained myself. I have like nothing more to say. Crap. This blog thing isn't exactly going great; I mean, I'm writing tons, but it's also draining tons of time. Maybe I'm not doing it right. I don't want to not record this field trip though. The few diary entries I do have are kind of precious to me. They reveal lots of stuff that I'd completely forgotten about. Okay... focusing. Right. Usually I'm really quiet. Once when my best friend revealed that she was friends with me to this kid she was asked if we had been introduced through sign language. Jerkwad.   Today was completely not your garden-variety no-words boring-Bio field trip. I mean, there were long-winded tour guides, but the stuff they were saying was completely fascinating. Like, about marine biology and the tectonic plates and how sedimentary rock was formed by dirt being smushed. I'm an ignorant geek and I love it. Also we saw jellyfish and starfish and crabs. I held one of the latter and just thinking about it now makes me giggle. I'm extremely ticklish, so when I was holding it the little legs were scrabbling all over my hand and I was completely cracking up. I tried to pass it off to this other boy, and I think he thought I was holding a vibrate-y sex toy or something, I was laughing so much. So that was good. Have you ever seen a jellyfish swim? It's extremely cool. It's like this clear sack full of water ripples and contracts and it's very pretty in a creepy way. Also we played volleyball and I  didn't suck!  If you knew me you'd know how unusual an occurance this is. I am the original klutz. (Seriously, look up 'uncoordinated' in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me.) It was fun and I laughed and snarked and ran after the ball and hit it pretty well. If I don't over-analyze the experience I think I'll come away from it with a good memory. My lunch sucked (a made-in-5-mins PB&J plus a Coke plus half a donut), but the company was good. This whole thing took place at this rocky beach in Jamestown. I totally established myself as the class's rock-climbing champion. I went further and faster than anyone else.   At one point most of the prep-type boys in the class stripped down to swim shorts and got in the water. I averted my eyes for most of it, though; I knew if I looked I'd have to stare, and that'd be way uncool. One more thing- I came away from this with a new crush. I now have two/three unserious ones and this new official one. It kinda helps that there's a tiny tiny chance that he might have a crush on me, though I mostly doubt it. You know what I love? When you make eye contact with a boy, and he was looking at you first. That sends shivers down my spine. When I'm looking at a boy and then he looks at me I just feel uncomfortable. Last great thing about this trip: this was like the first time I actually felt that I could actually go up to a boy and start a conversation. I didn't, but I felt like if I'd wanted to I was comfortable enough to actually do it.   There was only one other notable event today. On my way home from school (I walked again) I was mistaken for a prostitute. Consequence of being a white girl in a black neighborhood. It was  three o'clock  for Chrissake though. Whatever. I need to go read recaps now. I'm tired. I don't want to write anymore. Hopefully over time on the blog I'll be cured of long-windedness.   Currently Reading:  Second Helpings  by Megan McCafferty. I'm reading it for like the sixteenth time. Literally. I love that book. I've given up on Jack Kerouac for now.  Cat's Cradle  will just have to suffice as this year's Beat book.   Goodbye anonymous web-surfers.&nbsp;

      The last post sucked all the energy I usually spend on IMing out of me. I think that's good; when I get all rant-y on AIM I tend to get in fights. I felt like posting again, though, and this seemed a good thing to comment on.   Does anyone else out there watch  Jeopardy ? I love it. It's especially thrilling because I'm 14, so I'm kind of handicapped, but I still occasionally know things that the contestants don't. Nothing like a little intellectual superiority. This week they're having this 'Power Players' thing. All the brightest minds of the political scene- at least, all those that have nothing better to do than compete on a game show- compete for $$$ for the charity of their choice. It's like the  Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?  celebrity edition, except with Ari Fleischer instead of [Insert name of dorkus pseudo-celebrity here]. So, yeah. Today it was the political thing and Alex Tribek cracked on this guy's relationship with his wife. Yes, Alex Tribek  cracked  on someone. Bizarre, I know. So the guy was just standing there looking kinda pissed, and then Alex tells him to laugh it off. Somehow the situation digresses until the contestant is pretending that he has to be held back (you know, like he's trying to go after Tribek) and Alex is all, "You want some of this?" Seriously, he said that. I was rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. Well, rolling on the couch, actually. Speaking of which...   I made a discovery the other day. It was a pathetic, very me discovery, but a lightbulb moment nonetheless. You know that annoying ROTFLMAO thing people use when they post online? I knew what the first 5 letters stood for, but the last three were a total mystery. Chairman Mao? Mayonnaise? I had no clue. But then the other day I had a total epiphany. It came out of nowhere:  my ass off ! Rolling on the floor laughing  my ass off ! When I figured it out I started yelling very loudly and laughing- I'm fairly certain my family thought I was insane. It takes very little to make me happy.

      Okay, here it is. The much-anticipated first blog of one Miss&nbsp;Poire, a.k.a.  moi . Oh, the roses! The applause! The glamour! The BS! No one, At All, ANYWHERE, cares about this blog- except for me. The only reason to put any effort into it is because maybe, someday, when I'm a famous Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Ha ha! As if) my fans will search the depths of the 'net for my old work and pull out this. Hmmm... At this rate, I'm not even going to get a C on my term paper. Okay, seriously now. The reason I'm starting this thing is that I want to be a writer. I'm kinda keeping this ambition under wraps, though, 'cause I seriously have no idea if I'm any good at all. My dad thinks I am, but, hey- he has to say that. He's my parent. But if I want to have any chance of achieving this at all I have to actually, oh, I don't know,  write something . So I'm opting for this, because even though I can't think up good fictional characters or soap opera plots, I am fairly adept at commenting on my own life. Now all I have to do is actually post to this thing...   Mmmm... today's events. The most notable and fresh in my mind is my walk home from school. After waiting for my dad for more than an hour (in which I had nothing to do except braid and un-braid this one strand of hair) I finally gave up and started trudging home. Not the best idea, considering my flip-flops and 20-lb. backpack. I hate walking places. It's not that I don't like being outside, it's just... the people. I mean, when you pass a person on the street what are you supposed to do? Should you make eye contact, smile, and offer friendly salutations? If so, how long should you hold eye contact for? And will they think you're intrusive and/or psycho if you stare too long? But on the other hand, if you just avert your eyes and walk quickly past, they'll think you're unfriendly. So what I usually end up doing is trying to avert my eyes, but still darting glances at the person who's walking past me. I have a feeling this is very trapped-squirrel of me, and way weirder than anything else. So, yeah. I'm walking down the street, backpack full-up on my shoulders, and this car slows down next to me. The Hoochied-up passenger said, and I quote, "Why you walkin' like that?" before speeding away.   My initial reaction was, 'Do I know them?' My school wasn't that far away, and I thought maybe someone was just puzzled that I would sit outside for an hour, and then just get up and leave. But then I realized, no, that's not it, I'm walking so bizarrely that a total stranger felt compelled to comment on it. It's not the first time someone has mentioned this. My mom's always telling me not to stoop over (I've got tall-girl-hunchback syndrome) and my friend's (meddlesome) mother once noted it also. But the rudest comment I ever received about it was when once in seventh grade this eighth-grade boy that I didn't know said, "Hey, aren't you that girl who walks weird?" when I asked him to stop blocking the door to my homeroom. I mean, COME ON! This is America! Doesn't anyone have the right to walk like they want without getting all kindsa grief about it? I'm not one of those people who wants to be informed about their annoying quirks. I'd rather stroll along in blissfull ignorance, as I don't change easily. Anyway, I digress.   After the car pulled away I kept walking, mentally debating with myself. An incident like this is all it takes to put me into overly-self-conscious mode. (If the kids I went to school with were bullying types I would be so dead.) I kept shifting my backpack back and forth between hanging it off one shoulder and putting it all the way on. I was trying to figure out which would be the least likely to cause a weird walk. It was worse than it might've been otherwise because I was walking down what was basically a highway past a bunch of people in cars waiting to move on. I was the only one on the sidewalk. Why is this bad? Because, in my world, that means that all eyes are focused on me, something I hate. When my mom used to go to this weird peace-love church everyone would get up and hold hands in a circle at the end of the service. I was always paranoid that the person looking at me from the other side of the circle was mentally criticizing me. Keep in mind that I was  eight  at the time. Jesus. No wonder I'm so messed up.   It wasn't until about five minutes after The Incident that I realized that a confident girl, the type of person I want to be, wouldn't have been bothered by this. Cool-me wouldn't even have noted it, except for maybe flipping the car-person the bird. And even if she had she would have come to the conclusion that she can walk however she wants, and let other people say what they please. God, I wish I was my cool self, my alterna-universe Poire. It'd be mondo, uber, wicked, totally and very very kewl. Well, I guess this incident has gotten about as much- oh who am I kidding, WAY MORE attention than it deserves. This ability to rant on and on about nothing bodes well for my blogging future, as I don't have many significant events in my non-life to talk about.   Currently Reading:  On the Road  by Jack Kerouac. Stole it (not literally) from my English teacher, 'cause she's been practically begging us to read it. It's not quite my thing, but then I haven't: a) been to college, b) been a boy or c) ever had sex. Anyway, it's kinda too depressing for me- I don't think I'm a Beat girl. (By the way, the 'Currently reading:' thing is stolen from  urlLink pamie's  weblog. Just wanted to give credit where credit was due.)   Peas out, y'all.

      Ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. My feet are  killing  me. And my butt. And my thighs. Ow. And did I saw ow? I am never again going to bike home from the mall after walking around all day in bad shoes. I can feel the blisters. Ow.   I'm beginning a road trip tomorrow. I'm traveling to Tennessee with my sister and maternal grandparents to visit relatives I haven't even met yet. Key terms: air conditioning, CDs, pools, great-aunts and uncles, motels, the alphabet game*, Southern drawls, grapes and cheese crackers (car food), too-much-nearness suffocation. And  naps . There are going to be enough of these that this word deserves special attention. I'm pretty psyched right now (I love riding in cars), but I know the novelty will be gone after the first week (I'm going for 16 days). Oh well. At least packing will be fun.   The last two days have kind of sucked. I've been doing dishes, and cleaning, and making lunch for everyone, and then washing the dishes from that, and then reminded not to mess up my room, since I  always  do. Gee, Dad. Thanks so much. Now I have tons of incentive to keep it neat. I got a break today when I went to the mall with Natalia. I had a really excellent time, though I didn't buy anything. Short list of activities: tried on ridiculous shoes, tried on perfume, ate mustard samples in a gourmet food store, ate chicken samples in the food court, tried on clothes in the Gap, looked through posters in Newbury Comics, and browsed in Borders. I stayed after she did, but I could tell it was time to go home when I was shifting from foot to blistered foot and thinking the same thought over and over again. I was tired enough already that riding home practically killed me.   Mmph. God. I'm supposed to go wash dishes now. I was only allowed to leave after I promised to wash dishes later. I feel like utter crap- this sucks. If this entry is all over the place, it's because of the fatigue.   *Alphabet Game, The: A car game that may be played by two or more people. The object is to find all the letters of the alphabet on road signs before your opponents. Two people cannot use the same letter on the same sign. The letter does not need to be at the beginning of the word. Anything with letters on it counts- street signs, graffiti, license plates, notices in windows, etc. Example- 'X' can be found in 'Exit'; 'Q' can be found in 'Grand Marquis'. I don't care if this is confusing. My feet hurt.

      Teacher let the monkeys out! One went east, one went west, one went up the teacher's dress! I revel in my immaturity. If you want other abusive school songs or nasty songs about Barney the Dinosaur, I'm your gal. (And half of the tunes are from my mom, too.)   Tell me this- do normal people ever get stalker vibes when investigating the character of a boy they like? Natalia knows my 'crush' (Crushee? Crush recipient? Sorry, no names), kind of, and she was filling me on little details about his life, personality, etc. I know I shouldn't feel weird about this, as it's not exactly an uncommon practice, but the whole time I kept on getting creeped out by what I was doing. I feel even more icky about it now, after the fact. Apparently my transition into teenager-hood isn't complete yet. I'll just have to try harder to be okay with it.   Unless- is this something I should avoid? Is this kind of thing creepy and immature and to be avoided at all costs? Am I becoming a brainless idiot? God. I'm going to stop thinking about this now. All this second-guessing is just the Devil's advocate in me coming out.   Today was the last day of school. I am now officially a fresh-more, a teen stranded between ninth and tenth grades. Usually on the last day of school I get sentimental and think about how I'm never going to sit in these specific classrooms again, or how I'll miss the teachers (well, teacher-missage is rare), or whatever. In high school it's a lot different. I've been having finals for the past week, and I've stayed home twice. When you factor in the weekends and the reviews we were having for finals, I haven't had a normal day of school in two weeks. Most of the big projects were turned in even before that. I've had all this time to acclimate to summer, so there's not a lot of end-of-school appreciation. It's too bad, really. One of the best feelings in the world was that last-day shock, the realization that your imprisonment was over for two whole months. That feeling is mostly gone now.   Today was really a do-nothing day. I feel all lethargic and heavy-limbed. I came in an hour late and no one even cared. Almost all of the teachers and students hadn't bothered to come in, and at first I just wandered around the building looking for familiar faces. The few people that were there stuck with each other, regardless of which class they were supposed to be in. There were really only two important things that happened today, and even they're hardly worth mentioning. In Biology we watched a video on Einstein. Only five kids stayed for it. Stupid teenagers- no NOVA appreciation whatsoever. The part about old Al's personal life was pretty boring, but the theories! Oh, the theories. I want to go out and read a book on physics now. I actually made it into Honors Physics (I was one of only ten freshmen who got in), but I bypassed it in favor of Chemistry, the suggested choice. Now I kind of want to change my mind, but I guess it's too late. Oh, well- junior year.   The only other thing that happened today was that I went to Henna's English class and got my ass kicked at Scrabble. Yep- it was one hell of an exciting day.   Currently reading: About eight books at once. I have a bunch of  Cat Who...  mysteries that I've never read, so I'm working my way through those. I'm also finishing up  Watership Down  and trying to get through  Anna Karenina . I've got twenty books stacked up in my room waiting to be read on my upcoming road trip to Tennessee, and I've read a little bit of each of them. I got a lot of them off  urlLink Amazon  for my birthday. Gah. Just thinking about them makes my head spin. Note to self: never attempt to take on more than three books at once.

      I think I'm going crazy. I don't feel crazy, or especially displeased with my thoughts, but if I view them objectively I'm forced to conclude that there is something wrong with me. I've just been going on and on on instant messenger about how cool cheese is and how I want to buy some good quality cheese. I'm getting a job and I'm looking forward to buying cheese. I'm also making an effort to become obsessed with buying comic books. This is like trying to get addicted to cigarettes. I'm really happy with all my weirdness, but it just seemed worth noting. This way, when I'm carted off to the loony bin, there'll be some documentation of what drove me over the edge. I've also been spelling out words in sign language while walking down the hall at school. It's the less crazy equivalent of talking to myself in public. What would a shrink say about this? Cry for attention? Irreparable psychosis? I hope it's both.   My birthday passed on the eighth without much fuss. On the day itself I wanted to type up an in-depth analysis of every event, but I was pretty depressed at the time so I mostly just wanted to figure out exactly what happened to make me feel bad so I could have some justification for righteous anger. I did see  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  though, and dude? Best. Movie. Ever. Seriously. It rocked my world. Occasionally I get these pure moments of euphoria, like unadulterated happiness, and I got one at the end of the movie. While that might have been as much hormones as movie quality, you should still see it.   I started this thing at a funny time in my life. A lot of the things I mention, however briefly (going to the gym, flirting with boys, whatever), may sound casual, but would have been considered a significant 'wow' kind of thing a few months ago. Things are changing. I can feel them changing. I spent basically my entire pre-high school life being afraid. I can't express how afraid I was. One of my earliest memories is of worrying that my kindergarten class would hate me because I got some privilege they missed out on. Throughout middle school I walked head down, close to the wall, the tall girl who was full of shame. I'm not saying that that's entirely disappeared, or that I was the only one who ever felt like that. It's just that now that's been significantly reduced, and I'm glad. I can talk to people and enjoy it. I can flirt, and have done so on two separate occasions to date (baby steps- don't scoff). I can actually clean my room- yes, this was a huge struggle for me just a little while ago. I'm doing my homework. I'm actually having a life. Kind of.   Note- The first two paragraphs of this entry are from a draft I made on the eleventh.

      I don't feel like going into too much tea-party-detail. I kind of need to talk about The Boyfriend Of The Other Girl, though. Seeing as this is the first significant interaction with a boy I've had (don't say it- at almost-15, I know I'm pathetic), Henna keeps on pressuring me to "snatch him". I don't think she's serious. At least, I hope she's not. God, I hope she's not. She's probably just attempting to live vicariously, as her own romance isn't going anywhere at the moment.   Does it count as flirting if a boy takes note of things you've said, continually comes over to talk to you, high-fives you on discovering you've read the same book, and sits 5 inches away from you when there's about 5 square feet of available space? I wish I knew. I think it does. Does it? Hello? Anyone? It seems significant that a female friend of his seemed uncomfortable with our being so chummy. I think a lot of it was because I was giving off I'm-into-you vibes, something a more experienced person would have been able to prevent. He kept on coming over to me, and I kept on moving away quickly. I wasn't sure if he was flirting, but no way was I even going to take the chance of being weird with my almost-friend's guy. Although, I can't say much for her taste. If I had been free to flirt, I'm not sure what I would've done. The most significant thing about this whole thing is that he was into me. He doesn't go to my school, so he doesn't know me as a dork. For a little while, I was able to step back and see myself as a stranger would, and it was enlightening. I wasn't a dork, I was a tall, fairly pretty girl who said amusing things and was into him. Sorry for rambling on about this. I'm just trying to get my head around this new type of interaction.   Although, my breasts were showing a tiny bit, so that might have been the basis of the whole thing. Actually, hmmm... When we were discussing who would be what food, he said I would be a pancake, because I'm "flat". I have a C cup. Okay, this is a good excuse to be mad at him. Breast-obsessed teenage-boy bastard. And with that, I am over this whole thing. It's probably better this way. Once in an interview-thing in  Seventeen , a boy discussed how a girl had recorded their encounters in detail on her blog. He said it was completely creepy. I want to avoid that, because of course magazines are the true word of God and I should always do everything they say. Including buy a $150 pair of pants with chains just because Hilary Duff has them. Chuh.   Song That Is Currently Annoying The Hell Out Of Me:  The Reason  by Hoobastank. If I may be so bold- Hooba stank  is right. This is just another song I hate for no reason. Also,  My Immortal  was driving me insane when it was being played constantly.   Note: This is my most schizophrenic entry to date. I think. Good night.

      Okay, I was going to make a really long post, but I'm completely tired. I can tell because when I stand up I feel like I'm going to die, and my right leg really hurts. Apparently I'm like those old arthritic people. I get laid as much as they do, too. Har dee har har. Okay- the lowdown. I had an excellent time at the party. Can you say badminton, lemon tarts, and low-cut pastel dresses? Also, the top story of the evening: I have a crush on another girl's boyfriend. I am so going to bad-girl hell when I die. To be continued.

      No plans for the evening have panned out. I didn't watch any TV, didn't do any homework, didn't pick out my dress-up tea party outfit, didn't did-not neglected-to-do. Et cetera. Going back on the blog has made me kind of hyper, and I've re-read all my posts twice already. It seems that it'd be more productive to just write something so I can start crossing stuff off my to-blog-about list.   I've changed my profile around a bit, and the new picture is the  Buffy  poster I was talking about. Y'all like? I wish there was an English word that signified the plural of you. I guess I'll have to resort to French:  Vous  like? That's better. I'm just rambling. I'm tired. Something I didn't clarify in my last post- Natalia is my other best friend. I met her in 3rd grade and Henna in 6th. I'm not going to get into the merits of one versus the other- that's just a minefield of Don't Go There. I do put some value on my life after all.   I'm supposed to go to this "tea party" tomorrow. I put tea party in quotation marks because I don't know if any teenagers besides me actually like tea, so I doubt any tea'll actually be drunk. Sugar-addicted losers. Ha- I sound so jaded and cynical. Or not. The party's going to be crowded with people I don't know or don't like (or both) and the person who's holding it (Emma) is a friend of Natalia's that I can't figure out. I mean, I know I dislike her, but I can't figure out exactly why, or decide whether it's merited or not. It might be jealousy, or spite, or inadequacy, or the position of the stars. It also bugs me that it bugs me so much. I just don't like unreasonable dislike- it makes me feel petty. Back on topic- this same kind of party was held last year, and I didn't enjoy myself then either. It's really hard for me to talk to people I don't trust, so I basically latched on to Natalia when I wasn't standing apart from everyone else staring at trees or grass or sky. Why am I even going to this thing? When it was first mentioned to me I was moderately psyched, but I suspect that I was riding a hormonal high. Now I'm kind of dreading tomorrow. I know the food's going to suck.   Currently reading:  The Fellowship of the Ring  by J.R.R. Tolkien. I've never read this book before, if you can believe it. I've been trying to since elementary school, practically, and I think I've built up a mental block about it. Every time I've tried to read it I've managed to get to the part where Frodo sells his house and leaves, and then I drop it for something easier. By now I've read that part at least 7 times without getting any further, and every time I try to read it again I feel like I have to read that part, but when I do I get bored... It's just a vicious cycle. I think I'm beating it this time though; I'm getting through it pretty fast. This whole thing just kills me because I'm a book-a-holic. I love fantasy and description and poetry and nuance. This is exactly the sort of book I should adore; plus, it's quite embarrassing to have to admit that you've never read  The Lord of the Rings . Almost as embarrassing as not having seen  Star Wars , which is my other great shame. I have hope for this yet, though. It took my forever to get through  The Golden Compass , but I did it eventually, and the trilogy is now one of my favorites. I just have to suck it up and power through. On a side note, I've seen the movies, so I know how it ends. Way to steal my motivation, Peter Jackson!   Have you ( vous ) ever noticed how when a good book is discovered by someone else you like it less? I kind of think that's just me. I would adore  The Perks of Being A Wallflower  so much more if it had been my find, and I know if someone else had shown me  Where The Heart Is  I would've enjoyed it less. I suppose this is just me being stupid again. I can be incredibly possessive about the things I like. Just hearing that someone I dislike is listening to a CD makes me dislike it, and I never want to let my sister read my books. Let me slip into Freud mode... I suppose that I feel that my few strengths, the few things I'm secure in, are being threatened. I'm not sure about whether I'm 'good enough', but I know the things I like are worthy, and I feel like other people are stealing my merits. In my inexpert opinion, anyway.   I'm also reading some books in the Dollanganger series (by V.C. Andrews) and I'm skimming my  Song of the Lioness  books. I really feel starved for books right now. It'll be so good to get some new ones- at the moment my reading list includes  Please Don't Kill the Freshman ,  Lucky ,  The Basic Eight  and  Why Girls Are Weird . Lately I've been depending on blogs for reading material though. Some of them are as good as novels.  urlLink The Grub Report , for instance. I love nothing better than a good food description. ( Kitchen Confidential  by Anthony Bourdain is excellent for that.) Other good blogs include  urlLink About A Boy ,  urlLink Dancing Brave ,  urlLink pamie.com ,  urlLink Uncle Bob  and  urlLink Zoe Trope .   I'm going to quit now. I'm tired, and I'm neglecting baby-sitting duties. I haven't actually sat on Ian for over an hour. Plus I yelled at him. I suck. Goodbye.

      Gah! Heart attack city! I've been neglecting this thing for the past few weeks, and when I checked it just now, I saw that a comment had been posted. Wait, let me restate that. A comment had been posted  in the entry in which I discussed breaking my dad's rules.  And my dad has been known to snoop around the web history when we're not around. I do believe 2 + 2 = 4? So I started to freak out. I'm completely paranoid about my dad (not without cause) and I was positive that he'd posted something about how I was a deceitful little witch who was grounded for the summer. This was especially alarming because recently he's been acting kind of weird. He always wants me to keep my room spotless, but lately he's been coming into it (and it looks horrible, like a tornado's run though it) and saying nothing. I wish I knew what he was up to. He's probably going to bawl me out this weekend, saying how he gave me the chance to prove that I could be responsible without being ordered, and this just proves that his scolding is necessary. Or else he's assigned the task of disciplining me to my mom. If that's the case, he'll be back on my case soon. I can't see him being able to bear the mess in my room without saying anything. Anyway, all the panic was for naught- it turns out the comment was from someone else, which surprised me. I didn't think that anyone would actually read this. Thanks  stargirl  (love that book), and by the way, the girl in my profile-picture isn't me. Sorry. I look exactly like that when I'm reading though, and Google-ing was much more convenient than borrowing a digital camera and making a mess. I think I'll try to post a different picture- we'll see how that works out.   Tuesday's my birthday. I am completely underwhelmed by how excited everyone is. I'm having no party, again. (Well, last year there was the Chuck E. Cheese thing, but to quote Xander, "No power on this earth...") The only presents I'm getting are the result of me telling my mom exactly what she was going to get for me and exactly where she was going to get it from. I do have to credit Henna though; she actually remembered my birthday, and asked what she should get me. It would be kind of nice to have a party with someone other than my grandparents, but I've had too many bad experiences in the past, which I don't feel like going into right now. I'll just say that wiping Ian's poopy butt and a singing Chuck E. Cheese comes into it.   Just a few more Birthday 2004 facts. Presents requested include:  Nevermind  by Nirvana,  The Wall  by Pink Floyd,  A Rush of Blood to the Head  by Coldplay (CDs) and  The Basic Eight  by Daniel Handler and  Why Girls Are Weird  by Pamela Ribon (books). There's also  une belle affiche de Buffy  (a beautiful  Buffy  poster). I'd link to it if it was possible; the poster, I mean. It's from season one, and it's all gothic, with red and black clothes and thick eyeliner. All the characters are in a warehouse or something. You can find it at  urlLink AllPosters  if you try. My grandparents asked what I wanted and I said nothing, which is kind of true. All the things I listed are trifles; my mom's only getting like four of them. The thing I really want is Netflix, but again, more later. That is, if I actually keep posting to this. (Knock on wood) Last piece of trivia- on the eighth I'm having an English quiz that's worth  20% of my grade ! It's just sick to do that to someone on their birthday. Natalia's sick of hearing about it, but c'mon!   On Sunday my grandparents are coming for a birthday celebration. I'm looking forward to seeing the GPs more than usual, as I think the no-presents request has made my grandmother feel kindly toward me. Memere never wants anything at Christmas. She's really religious, and I think the commercialization of Jesus's birth makes her ill. I don't know what we're going to end up doing on Sunday; right now options include bowling, Six Flags, and Uno's. Okay, maybe the fact that they're taking me somewhere nice is a sort of present, but at least I'm not requesting actual items.   Okay, right now I'm ignoring Henna on AIM, so I should really go. Blog with you later.

      Oh,&nbsp;bliss. Happy happy happy. I'm joyful. Not in a temporary, hormonal-overload way, but in a real, grounded, everything-is-finally-working-out sort of way. I have never in my life had everything be fine. There's always been school, or friends, or body image, or&nbsp;not-smart-or-special-enough get in the way. I don't really know what it'll be like, having everything under control. Totally weird, probably. I'm&nbsp;sure jinxing my happiness by talking like this, but whatever. At least everything's good for now.   Today I was working with my dad and I saw this old newspaper article on the wall about my mom. It was from 1995, when I was, according to the article, '4'. Whatever, P. Journal. It came with color pictures of our old home. The whole thing was based on my mom's mission to fix up the dilapidated house we used to live in. It was so weird to see what the place I lived in used to look like. It was a triple-decker (a three-story apartment building for the architecturally-unaware) from the turn of the century, with peeling white paint and Victorian detail.You could see where porches used to extend off the front of the house, though the only evidence of them then was three strips of excess material on the house's front. The yard was overgrown with weeds.   Here&nbsp;was my mom, not even 30, with two children under six, no husband, no job, and a huge house that was on the brink of demolition. Rooms were filled from floor to ceiling with debris that the last owner had collected. One room contained nothing but motorcycles. The only good thing in the entire place was the frame of the house. DCYF (The Department of Children Youth and Families) almost took&nbsp;my sister and I away.&nbsp;My mom recruited construction workers ('Dead Heads'; followers of the Grateful Dead), applied for grants, took every precaution with my sister and I, went over whoever's head she needed to, to do what had to be done.   Do you know how that house looks today? There are 4 fixed-up, beautiful, spacious apartments. The side lot was bought and turned into a parking lot and garden. The side of the house that used to be filled with poison ivy is now a mulch-ed path and semi-patio. It is clean and beautiful, with the original detail preserved. I will never be prouder of my mom than for what she did with that house. Now she's doing much the same with our new place, although not on as drastic a level. People like my grandparents scoff, but I trust her. I know she can do this.   My little brother Ian is sitting on the radiator behind me, eating a container of blueberries. He just kicked down the door to my sister's room. He's showing me a list he made that says "SLEEPOVER NETFLIX" in yellow highlighter. He's missing his two bottom front teeth. If I try, I can still carry him with a hip and one arm. He's hyper and shy and stubborn. Let me ask him for a quote.   POIRE: "Hey Ian, gimme a quote."  IAN: "Huh?"  POIRE: "Say something cool."  IAN: "Blah."   And then he laughed.   IAN: I mean not blah, not blah, change blah to..."   And then he went pffffft spittily (you know, where you stick out your tongue and blow). I love you, Ian.   And just for Henna...   "I saw fireworks from the freeway and behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  Cause you were born on the fourth of july, freedom ring  now something on the surface it stings  that something on the surface it kind of makes me nervous who says that you deserve this  and what kind of god would serve this? We will cure this dirty old disease  if you've got the poison I've got the remedy   "the remedy is the experience. It is a dangerous liaison  I say the comedy is that its serious. Which is a strange enough new play on words  I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend the rest of your nights with the light on  So shine the light on all of your friends because it all amounts to nothing in the end.   "I won't worry my life away.  I won't worry my life away.   "I heard two men talking on the radio in a cross fire kind of new reality show  Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  they were counting down the days to stab the brother in the be right back after this  the unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast his catastrophe  dance with me, because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy"   Ian knows the words to that song. That is so messed up. He's now singing the messed-up words to the Teletubbies theme that my mom taught him. "Stinky Pinky, Dipshit, Pee Pee, Poop..." Goodbye for now. I'm going to go throw an exercise ball at him.    Lyrics courtesy of  urlLink JasonMraz.com .

      I am a teenage girl.   I know that there are those among you who will doubt this and say to themselves that I'm actually a lame-ass pathetic middle-aged woman in Tulsa (no offense, Tulsa), typing away in the middle of the night. This is not the case. I am a teenage girl, and while I'm not affluent, I'm friends with those who are. I'm also white. Possibly you can see where this is going.   I&nbsp;have a little bit of a thing about my weight. I'm not fat,&nbsp;anorexic, obese,&nbsp;bulemic, or what have you, but there is a self-consciousness, as there is with probably 90% (I totally made that figure up) of people in my demographic. I'm 5'9", with a C cup and a size 12 and a large frame. I'm not fat, but  damn  does it suck to be larger than most of the girls in your school. You can have healthier habits than most (which I do), you can trim down to an 8, but there's still going to be those extra 2 (or 3 or 4) inches of height. It can be shitty.   This thing is a bit of a clusterfuck for me; I hardly know where to begin about my feelings and neuroses and cultural stigma and all that. I can't even imagine what it must be like for people who have a genuine lifelong-struggle  problem . It must be completely awful. There is such an obsession in our country with food. You know how when an annoying song is stuck in your head you try not to think of it... and it only makes you think of it more? That's how it is with food. "Yes, there is food that I love all around me, and I'm hungry, but the food is bad, mmmm, bad, so hungry, bad, bad, bad, bad, ohmygodIwantthatdonut!" POUNCE. CHOMP. And then the shame.   That isn't something I've had to deal with much. I've never had enough of a thing to actually attempt a full-on Diet, but I can imagine how it is. It's so stupid, though, that you have these two equally important and entirely different (and opposing) forces both pressuring you at once. It's Fashion vs. Food. Society against Snickers. There's not much conflict. You're genetically programmed to go with the food- unless your brain takes a wrong turn and goes with the eating-disorder route.   All I'm saying is that the food thing is this really big mess. I've dealt with my share of it. My mom has been saying since forever that she's really fat, and she's not&nbsp;(although I should add that she's never once pressured me to lose weight or told me that I was anything other than pretty). I've felt like I wasn't right weight-wise ever since I thought to have an opinion on the matter. I was a well-read kid, and I knew all about people who thought they were fat when they weren't and held supermodels up as ideals. I pitied them, and never thought for a second that I might be one of them. I thought that I was fat when I was a size 8 (which is really the smallest I can be and be healthy). That's sick. I thought that the model's in the Delia*s catalogs were the acceptable way to look.&nbsp;Since I didn't resemble them in the least, I felt I had to change myself.&nbsp;  I'm going to change horses midstream a little bit here. Everything I just talked about is absolutely true. However, I've been dealing with this for a few years now, and I think it's okay to want to change my body a bit and still believe in everything I talked about. There are good reasons for wanting to lose weight. My body-image isn't terrible now, either.  It's kind of difficult to&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;what I really want&nbsp;in all of this. My instinct is to try and lose weight. I really don't want to approach this unnecessarily though, or with dubious motives. I've thought about it, and I really think that this is okay. You might say that it's hypocritical to talk about dieting after ranting against the system of thinness/gluttony forever. You could also add that I'm stupid to even hesitate. I mean, I'm a TWELVE. Horrors! Get the cross and holy water quickly, Watson, 'cause she's eaten the hound of the Baskervilles!   I can only reply that I was ranting against the obsession and the stigma; basically, things I feel like I have enough control over to be out of danger from. I'm happy almost all of the time, with most of the aspects of my life doing well. If I had to stay the weight I am now for the rest of my life I could definitely deal with it. But my lifestyle and eating habits mean that my weight would creep up, something I don't want. And I confess: I would like to be more svelte. I've avoided clothes-shopping for most of my life. And I'm always happiest when I'm working on something. I know that the reward of looking better, coupled with feeling better and that great feeling of accomplishment, are definitely enough motivation to do this thaaang.   I'm going to go for it. I'm going to try to adhere to balanced, healthy eating standards for the first time in my life. I'm already going to the gym, but I'm going to stop skipping days. There is the possibility that this won't work, or that I'm approaching this for the wrong reasons. I'm fifteen. I can learn from any mistakes I might make. I'm not sure how to end this, except by hoping that this wasn't too self-contradictory. Wish me luck. I wish all of you bodily happiness.   Currently Reading:  Catch-22 ,  The Wee Free Men , and  Fat Land . For the weight-consciousness among you-  urlLink Losing the Cow  is most excellent.

      Minor news flash in the book world. I'm probably the last one to report this, but anyway: the sixth Harry Potter book will be called  urlLink Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . When I found out I started hyperventilating&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;felt like I was going to faint. I tried typing the news to Henna, but my fingers wouldn't work. An overreaction maybe, but still: OH MY GOD! So happy. Really. And interestingly, the prince referred to in the title is neither You Know Who nor Harry. Can't wait to learn more, 'cause I'm a Spoiler Whore. Hee.   In other news... My cousin&nbsp;Tasia is becoming a teen, which equaled a lot of ranting to Henna on my part; my brother just decided to spill about 200 Disney Charades cards on my bedroom floor; Henna has her own  urlLink blog  now; Natalia's left us for piano camp (which will mean lots of "One time, at piano camp..." stories); I spent the night with Henna's extended family in Boston on Friday (don't ask);&nbsp; until today one of the windows in my room was missing, causing me to find six new mosquito bites on my arms nightly. Pray that I don't get malaria.   Unless you hate me, in which case I'm fully okay with you praying that I get it.   Currently Watching:  Monty Python and the Holy Grail ,  Gilmore Girls: Season 1: Disc 1, Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock: The Animated Version .

      Date: Sun, 25 Jul 2004  From:  urlLink mllepoire@yahoo.com   Subject: ENLARGE YOUR PENIS FOR ONLY $19.99!  To:  urlLink mllepoire@yahoo.com    Poire-   This isn't a  urlLink Viagra  sale. Sorry. I just wanted to get your attention. I know you've never gotten to see an ad like that, and you're curious about what they're like.&nbsp;I'm you,&nbsp;so I know stuff like that.   Now, you've been feeling a little down. You're sad that people have been ignoring your site and stuff like that. You thought that your natural talent&nbsp;with the written word would make you known throughout the Blogger community and, like cream, your site would rise to the top.   Well, you're not that delusional. You only thought that on the days when you'd gotten an 'A' in English and you were hormonal with a swelled head. But still.   Now, there's some stuff that you should remember (and this goes for all unlucky-in-popularity writers as well). Whenever you're feeling down, just think of the fact that  urlLink Pamela Ribon  used to give away her writing to boys, and she thought her high school diaries were excruciating.  urlLink The Bell Jar  almost didn't get published.  urlLink Anthony Bourdain  had two nobody-ever-heard-of-'em novels before hitting it big. And  urlLink J. K. Rowling  was a single mother with, I believe, nothing published.   And even if it doesn't work out&nbsp;in the end, the world isn't over. There are still a hundred million options left to you. You can be a chef, a teacher, a lawyer, an interior decorator, a doctor, a janitor, a stand-up comic, or whatever. And you can tell the&nbsp;universe about it through the internet. Best of both worlds, just for you.   Now, this might not be very reassuring. The depressed among you might find this pathetically perky and a poor representation of melancholy. But this isn't for you, is it? Now Poire, in the end it doesn't matter whether or not this gets read. In a hundred years, who will care? At least you'll have a record of your high school days, and you'll get some writing practice that doesn't involve what you did on your summer vacation.   And personally, I bet Viagra ads are totally overrated. Bob Dole,  who ?   Best wishes,  Your Self

       bib-li-o-phile ,  n. &nbsp;- 1. A lover of books. 2. A collector of books.   I've been reading about philosophy today. You've got your Nietzsche, Aristotle, William of Ockham, et cetera. And now they come&nbsp;in a revolutionary new format.  urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy: Fear and Trembling in Sunnydale  is philosophy for the masses and, like, the embodiment of everything I like in the world. It explains the  whys  of everything while using big words, and it has fun at the same time. I love how you can read about Nietzsche's philosophy of the nonexistence of good and evil in reference to Faith (Eliza Dushku's rogue Slayer), and comparing the ethics of Malcolm X with the Vampire Slayer's views on violence... well, kicks ass. This book reminds me of me- it combines intelligence with superficiality at the molecular level. By now I've got it totally dog-eared.   I love books. Sometimes I ask myself what I would choose if I had to decide between books and a TV/internet combo, kissing one goodbye forever. As much as I love the second duo, there's never been that much of a choice. Books have such an extensive history, with me as much as with the world. They're tangible, and diverse, and nonjudgemental. There's always one tailor-made for your personality, culture, situation, whatever. You can use them to distract you from your problems, or you can seek them out when your life is going perfectly. When I was stressed out in middle school I would take a second between classes to go to the library, breathe in the paper-smell, relax, and then leave. They're therapeutic. At one point I had almost 40 books checked out at once.   Right now I'm moving on from the fiction (mostly fantasy/teen oriented) I've confined myself to for most of my life. I'm checking out memoirs, polemics, balanced treatises, philosophy, classics, science fiction. I've got this scary-ass (according to my classmates, probably) reading list I've made for myself. I might not read half the books on it, as I don't know much about a lot of them, but for now they all seem interesting. Watch out, P. Public Library.     urlLink Gluttony: The Seven Deadly Sins &nbsp;-  Francine Prose    urlLink No Touch Monkey: And Other Travel Lessons Learned Too&nbsp;Late &nbsp;-  Ayun Halliday    urlLink Against Love: A Polemic &nbsp;-  Laura Kipnis    urlLink Chez Panisse Vegetables &nbsp;-  Alice L. Waters    urlLink The Blue Castle &nbsp;-  L. M. Montgomery    urlLink The Restaurant at the End of the Universe &nbsp;-  Douglas Adams    urlLink The Fellowship of the Ring &nbsp;-  J. R. R. Tolkien    urlLink Lincoln  -  David Herbert Donald    urlLink Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1 &nbsp;-  Isaac Asimov    urlLink Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast  -  Robin McKinley    urlLink Rose Daughter &nbsp;-  Robin McKinley    urlLink Cheese Primer &nbsp;-  Steven Jenkins    urlLink Lucky: A Memoir &nbsp;-  Alice Sebold    urlLink Catch-22 &nbsp;-  Joseph Heller    urlLink Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the World  -  Greg Critser    urlLink Relativity: The Special and the General Theory  -  Albert Einstein    urlLink Ghost World  -  Daniel Clowes    urlLink The Wish  -  Gail Carson Levine

      I want to be schizophrenic again. It's fun. You can be random, and say unrelated short pointless things. I don't really hate broccoli. My shirt that says I do is a compulsive lier. I'm starting to like coffee a lot. I think maybe my brother is a genius. Possibly I am underestimating everyone in the world and they're all much smarter than I think. Everyone in the world- Sorry. I suck.   I'm kind of regretting moving my blog. It was fun thinking that someone was reading it, besides the tiny bit of internet strangers and Henna. Oh, God. Maybe I'm becoming a extrovert. It's a small step from web-journal-show-off-ism (stick with me here, people) to jumping off a cliff wearing nothing but a flag. And then I set the flag on fire on the way down.   I'm psycho.   So, on a completely minor and unimportant note, I got Netflix today.  urlLink Netflix . Netflix! I told Henna, who really doesn't have that much to gain from it. Her response?   HENNA: "OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  ME: "I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"   For those who don't understand the importance of Netflix, let me tell you this: The main reason I got a job was for Netflix funding. Uh huh. That's right. It's that important. And I'm that crazy. Still not convinced? I have a whole rant especially built for people like you. Do you know how much DVD sets of television shows cost? $60 per season. This is for something I would watch maybe twice. But with Netflix, I pay only $22 a month and I can get unlimited movies. No late fees. Very convenient, too. And there is so much I want to watch. Over vacation I compiled a list of over 200 movies to see. They run the gamut from  Lost in Translation  to  Monty Python's Flying Circus  to  Weekend at Bernie's . And then there's  Groundhog Day . And  X-Men . And  Sex and the City . My friend, Netflix is no small blessing.   And you were right. They are paying me to advertise.   I let my brother pick out one movie from the first three we were allowed to order. He said he wanted to see  Bonnie and Chester , which I'd never heard of in my life. Searching for it brought up nothing. If Netflix, which has thousands and thousands of DVDs, doesn't have it, then it does. Not. Exist. Period. But tell this to a 6-year-old. Ian was insisting stubbornly that I click on the links he saw on the page.   IAN: No, check on everything!  POIRE: I am, I am. Jeez! There's nothing here. Ian, pick a different movie.  MOM: Ian, if you want a story get your butt in here  now !  IAN: Wait!  POIRE: Pick a different movie and hurry up.  IAN: Nooooooooo.  MOM: Ian!  POIRE: Mom's going ballistic. Hurry up... Oh my God! Fine, whatever.&nbsp;What's this movie called?  IAN:  Bonnie and Chester .  POIRE: Who's in it?  IAN: Bonnie and Chester  MOM: Get in here!   At this point Ian laid down on the floor and started bawling. Later it was discovered that he was thinking of  Rocky and Bullwinkle . Yeah. With the moose. He ended up picking  Spider-man vs. Doc Ock: The Animated Version  as a replacement, though. The weekend with that around is gonna be mad fun, let me tell you. Sigh with me, people.   The rhubarb pie my mom made could really use more sugar. I want to go buy good bread and cheese and eat a lot of fresh vegetables. It's the healthy period blues. Good night.

      Oh. My. God.   You know, you would think that it would occur to me that a blog in a&nbsp;public forum is, you know,  public . As in, anyone can read it. Parents. Schoolmates. Siblings. Strangers. You would think that. And you would be wrong.   Okay, maybe I did compulsively delete any mention of Blogger in my web history. Maybe it's true that I told no one but Henna the web address. Maybe it's true that I changed everyone's names. But, moronically, I still neglected to mention to Henna that I  wanted this to be private . Web strangers are different. They have no perspective on my life other than the one that I give them. They can't judge, really, or correct me about events I discuss. They know only what I tell them. It's a lot of power, actually.   I should say  you , I suppose. I changed the address, and now no one but 'web strangers' can read this.   Today I was in a buddy chat with Henna, Natalia, and a heretofore unmentioned fourth girl, Renee. We were joking and being stupid, talking about 'dancing air' and typing the lyrics to 'YMCA'. Blogs&nbsp;were mentioned, and it occurred to me to send a private message to Henna telling her to not, under any circumstances, tell anyone the whereabouts of my blog.   Too late. You probably guessed that. It was Renee who was told, by the way. She's nice, but completely not someone I'm close enough to for her to be privy to my innermost thoughts.   My reaction wasn't anything other than typical dramedy fodder. A quick 'g2g bye', a bunch of quiet " Fuck "s in succession, a frantic change of my blog settings, and then a mildly outraged phone call to Henna.   At the moment I'm a hormonal cocktail, and you know how paranoid about this thing getting seen I was, so at first it was just a long, hysterical rant. I knew nothing really bad was said, so I knew when I calmed down I'd be okay. But Henna, poor Henna, didn't know this. I think she thought that she'd totally ruined my life, or at least completely screwed everything up for a few weeks.&nbsp;I feel bad now, actually. Really bad. It's total shit to feel like that. I still haven't forgiven myself for dumping tomato&nbsp;soup on my mom's four years&nbsp;of  Cooking Light  magazine. (All the screaming on&nbsp;Mom's part didn't help, though.)   So, yeah. I mean, it's crappy, but there's no harm done really. Renee did want to know who 'Emma', the girl I'd badmouthed briefly, was, though. As for that, I really should have corrected it before this. It's not&nbsp;so much that I dislike her as it is that I have conflicted feelings about her, and it bugs me that I should&nbsp;be even slightly less than ambivalent&nbsp;about someone for no reason. It also bugs me that it bugs me. Whatever.   One thing that does help fix this is the fact that Renee told Henna that she really liked&nbsp;my blog&nbsp;and I could 'totally' be a writer. I am a compliment glutton. With me, flattery will get you everywhere.   And on a completely unrelated note, Henna wants everyone (and that's  all  the numerous people that are reading this) to know that she's Indian (Asian), not a hippie. She feels that calling her Henna gives the wrong impression. The name was at her request, though. On here, all names are at the&nbsp;request of the person, or they're middle names.   The moral of the story: Be prepared. Like&nbsp;the Boy Scouts. It doesn't mean censorship, just an awareness that this can be read by anyone at any time. Don't lose your shit and don't be surprised when it's seen, 'cause if you are, it's your own friggin' fault. Kapiche?   Tee hee.

      A little while ago I had&nbsp;9 windows open on my computer.&nbsp;Nine different things. At once. There was the 'You Are Signed In To MSN' window, the folder with my 200 MP3s, the Windows Media Player window, two windows with  urlLink  Gilmore Girls  episode transcripts , the window with  urlLink  Amazing Race  recaps ,  urlLink Uncle Bob ,  urlLink The Vine , and&nbsp; urlLink pamie 's archives. And then of course I had to open another window (this one) just to torture myself with tons and tons of HTML. I&nbsp;wanted to brag about the tons of websites I was looking at. Ha ha, jackass, I can look at more websites than you. So there.   I can get really anal-retentive about this. (Well, not just this...) Every single little thing that I want to look at must have its own personal window so I don't forget about it. We wouldn't a website to feel unloved, now would we? And with some websites one reading isn't enough. It's like books. I don't read them once. If they're good, I read them over and over and over and over... Saying I've read a book 16 times isn't an exaggeration. When you apply this to websites, you find that I could read every advice column over 4 years on  urlLink Tomato Nation  and still not be satisfied. In fact, you might say that I want to do nothing but read websites for the rest of my life!   Hmmm...   Do you think PMS has anything to do with this?

      I hate Henna. I really, really do. It is entirely her fault that I spent the last several hours going through my blog, reformatting and nitpicking and editing and crap. If it wasn't for her, I might never have realized that there was a perverted way to interpret my blogging-name as well. So I've spent all this time changing everything around. And I'm tired, and she sucks. Big time.  I have nothing to say here. I just wanted to republish this thing one more time, and I'm too tired and frustrated to figure out the probably quite simple alternative way to do that. I just got 3 new Yahoo! email addresses in a row. I'm on the warpath. Heads are going to roll... after I get some sleep.&nbsp;'Night (Notice the pointed lack of the word 'good'.)

      $18.75! $18.75! As in, nearly a month's worth of allowance (I have cheap parents). As in, two cheap CDs. As in, one hardcover book. As in, a pocketful of drugstore makeup. $18.75! I love that. I really do. It is so kick-ass that for an afternoon of easy labor (computer filing!) I can get away with this much dough. Moola. Dinero. Loot. Muahahaha!  &nbsp;  The sub-minimum $5-an-hour wage might strike some as unimpressive. Even I felt a little gypped. I've worked with my dad before, and I know how draining his tasks can&nbsp;be.&nbsp;I swear I fell asleep once while standing up and trying to operate a paper cutter. Oh, the boredom. But today far exceeded my expectations. I spent most of my 4 hours filling in the little squares in an Excel grid with my dad's customer information. (He runs his own printing business.) This wasn't boring in the least, 'cause I had to figure out the formulas for gross and net and taxes, and reformat it whenever it started messing up. Okay, I'm a dork, but this should come as no surprise. I mention it right in the title.  &nbsp;  Now, lest you assume that everything in this job is perfect (besides the $5&nbsp;pay I'm sure some people are scoffing at), let me assure you that there are flaws. For one thing, I suffered several minor heart attacks when a mispressed computer button led to a black screen with strings of nonsense letters across it. I also had the same rake hit me in the head and give me a splinter while I was raking up disgusting leaf goop in the driveway. I had to deal with disgusting leaf goop in the driveway. I had to deal with my dad's atrocious handwriting (many of the little boxes in Excel read '???'). My hands got coated with sticky rust-dust that has yet to wash off while I was throwing spare printing press parts into boxes. I probably got sunburned while standing around outside. I had several more minor heart attacks when huge hornets&nbsp;insisted on flying around near me. I had a pretty good time though, so it was definitely worth it.  &nbsp;  Oh, and the best part? The splinter is on my middle finger, so when I go show it to my sister, I can flip her the bird accidentally-on-purpose. Now that I have a job, I really am mature.

      My family is not what you would call Rockwellian. In fact, we're about the farthest you can get from it and still be Caucasian and educated with a mom, pop and 2.5 kids. If you know what I mean. Nevertheless, my mother decided to try to be a domestic goddess for the night and cook dinner. My mom is a kick-ass cook, but her&nbsp;chefdom can be&nbsp;schizophrenic. She specializes in everything from Shepherd's pie to crepes with green onions and beef. She took a cake-decorating course and can make the best frosting roses of anyone I know. Also, she can make dinner five nights in a row and then not touch the kitchen again for more than a month. My sister and I are quite adept at making burritos by now.  &nbsp;  However,&nbsp;tonight she ignored all this and made steak and potatoes. Steak, corn and potatoes- and oh, the potatoes. These were not your&nbsp;typical wimpy potatoes. Normally, the potatoes my family eats are no bigger than your fist. Seriously, close your hand, imagine that&nbsp;you fist is&nbsp;a little smaller, and there are our spuds. Now, make a fist, make another fist, imagine another half a fist, and put them together. These were the potatoes of tonight. When I was called down for dinner I looked in the toaster oven and there they were, like foil-wrapped omens of the coming apocalypse. They scared the shit out of me. Nothing, I say  nothing , should be that big. It makes me want to cry. When one was cut in half and smushed on my plate it took up the whole thing- and this was a typical big dinner plate. These were potatoes that needed almost a quarter of a stick of butter. Mmm... they tasted great with A1 sauce.  &nbsp;  All this led me to run upstairs for my made-by-American Girl (shut up) digital camera to document the madness. When I got downstairs and started snapping my entire family started mocking me and talking about how I was misrepresenting them by making it seem like we typically eat steak and potatoes. Ha ha. This from the same people who spent the entire dinner talking about the actors of  Bewitched  and who forced me to sit on a trash can when the supply of chairs let out. I have some pictures to show y'all, but I couldn't find the USB cord and crap like that. I had a jolly time tearing apart my closet looking for it, though. Thus concludeth the essay on dinner at my house.

      What's your most embarrassing moment? I have a few traumatizing ones, but a nice non-cringeworthy (relatively speaking) one is the time I was changing at a relative's house and accidentally left my underwear in the bathroom. With blood on them.&nbsp; And then my grandmother found them and left them in the very public sink to soak. I spent many a happy hour that day ranting to my sister about the terribleness of that, but today's events were, I believe, embarrassing enough to top even that.  &nbsp;  When left to myself, I am a romantic. I climb trees, tear up at sappy books, steadfastly believe that the movie will have a happy ending and the soap opera characters will get together. Not that I watch soap operas.  *Hem*  Anyway, I'm a positive person. Or, I am until I'm faced with the harsh reality of romance in my own life. Now, I might cherish a nice little crush in my mind, but once I dare tell my friends about it, everything is shot to hell. I go into super-self-conscious mode, with my mind darting to each and every flaw that my friends might see in my crush. Within the first hour I've convinced myself that they think he's a loser, and that they're just too nice to tell me about it. By the end of the next day the crush is effectively over, and I cringe when I look back on what a pathetic mess it made me. That's what usually happens.  &nbsp;  This time things went a little bit better. Natalia is actually kind of friends with The Boy In Question, and even after I told her and Henna about it I was able to retain my sanity. I even managed to have some conversations about him, gleaning personal information and whatnot, without losing interest (although I did kind of feel like a stalker).  &nbsp;  Enter today. I was instant messaging&nbsp;the two aforementioned girls, and the conversation turned to boys, as teen-girl-conversations are wont to do.&nbsp;Now, at first I supported this. They were trying to figure out a way to get us together, and they came up with this plan that involved my logging onto Natalia's account and instant messaging him from there, pretending like I had logged onto her account accidentally and didn't know who he was. At first I supported this plan, albeit reluctantly. But as the day went on I started to freak out more and more, thinking of all the little things that could go wrong. I felt so pathetic, wasting all this time and energy on a boy who was really nothing special. And who was I to obsess about anyone, even him? Why did I think that I was interesting enough, pretty enough, funny enough, to be deserving of anyone's affections? There is a boy in my school who is offensive and&nbsp;sort of ugly, with the worst sense of humor in the world. He tries to flirt all the time, and always gets brushed off. What made me any different from him?  &nbsp;  And so, by the afternoon I had freaked out to the point where any little thing could push me over the edge.&nbsp;I was online when my sister in her phone-impatience logged me off the computer by lifting the phone off the hook. I yelled at her, slammed her door, ran down the stairs fuming, and sat down to watch  Jeopardy!  in a huff. Right then I resolved to give up on the whole thing. When I logged back on to the internet a half-hour later, I acted like a bitch to my friends. If I had to be pathetic, at least I could act like I didn't care, and so escape with a shred of dignity.  &nbsp;  I thought today ranked with my most embarrassing moments. But really, the only thing that made it so terrible was my acting like an idiot. This guy is a nice guy, and it doesn't matter what my friends think of him. I wish I could have been brave for once. I don't know. I just need to relax and not get so worked up over shit.  &nbsp;  I don't know why I'm writing about boys so much. I'm such an un-boy-oriented person that it's laughable. I would try to psycho-analyze myself, but I'm tired and it's getting late and I have to eat dinner soon. I'm just going to edit this and then post it. Later I'm going to make sure that my blog is un-offensive and then tell my friends where to find this entry. As an apology and explanation. Guys- Sorry I'm such a freak. (And sorry for calling you 'guys'.)  &nbsp;  Hopefully I'll have something non-psycho to post later.&nbsp;

      This comes to you from a computer deep in the heart of America. I’m currently in an Indiana suburb, right smack in the middle of the Bible belt. If y'all feel like dropping by, I'm staying with the two nicest, most generous people to ever 'bless yer heart'- my (great)-aunt and uncle. Just to recap, my grandparents, sister, and I have been travelling since we left New England on Saturday, and we got here yesterday. We've also stopped at my maternal great-aunt's house and Niagara Falls, which I won't really discuss here. Also worth mentioning is the night we spent in the most hideous motel known to mankind- or at least, the most disgusting one my grandparents ever stayed in. But anyway- Indiana.   It is not quite an odd place, but it's so different than my city full of liberal, worldly, agnostic, cynical people that I feel compelled to brand it as such. When we pulled into the driveway yesterday there was not a cloud in the sky or a non-suburban house to be seen. All the trees had obviously been planted when the houses were built, scant decades ago, and it felt strange after living with hundred-year-old maples my whole life. The hundreds of cornfields I was used to, at least- my family took a 'road trip' through the Midwest a few years back. The people were different, too. I know people have phonetically spelled out Southern sentences ("Why, ay DEEclare! You've grown more'n a cornstalk in a rainstorm in JEWly!") much too often, so I'll refrain. I think that I can feel myself speaking differently already, though. I hope I am. Words sound much prettier here- easier to say, and not so harsh. When I contrast my sister's voice to soft Southern tones I find that the latter are much nicer.   I started this out wanting to talk about specific events. I was going to talk about today's artery-freezing lunch at a fish fast food joint, or about my aunt and uncle, or how Niagara Falls smelled like rotten fish. But I didn't. These entries never do turn out how I'd like them to- they're too unclear, for one thing. If you can put together half of what I've been going on about I'll congratulate you. Oh, well. I know I'm getting better, anyway. I can tell that my entries are more interesting than in previous blogs, and half the time I even get across the point I was trying to make. I'll just have to keep on striving to improve.   Currently Reading:  The Bell Jar  and  Why Girls Are Weird . The first is slightly overrated and the second slightly underrated. Both are pretty good. Can't go into much detail at the moment, as I think I'm going to be called to join the others for a game of cards at any moment. Talk to y'all later.

      Bizee! Biz-ee! Soh verree verree biz-ee! Aggh! The drama! The exclamation points! I have several hundred things clamoring for my attention at the moment, and I can't seem to go along with any of them. So, basically, I'm half-assing all my dozens of responsibilities. They range from unimportant (returning Netflix DVDs) to everyday urgent (the gym, working with my dad, et cetera). And then there's also preserving relationships (going to the beach with my mom after having not seen her in a while; making up with Henna after several stupid fight-things), and creating a bank account for the over $300 in checks currently stashed in my room, and signing up for the free college course I'll soon be ineligible for, and going to the doc to figure out whether the huge bug-bite-induced rash on my arm is dangerous, and arranging when to go to my grandparents house, and flossing my teeth before bed, and washing the dishes, and going to the movies with someone I like, and learning to drive.  God! Normally I get to micromanage any event in my life, but this (though it might not seem it to the untrained eye) is so much that everything is slipping past me. I haven't had a chance to go to the gym once this week. Both my parents and grandparents want me to go on vacation with them, and I haven't even started summer reading. I  wish  I was unoccupied enough to rot my brain out with Ellen, and the good Dr. P. I miss boredom.  I saw  The Village  the other day. The movie was slightly creepy, kind of stupid, and generally forgettable. The company, however, was not. I went along with Natalia and two of her friends, which included the BIL (boy I like). Gentle reader, I can tell you that during the car ride to the theater I thought that I was going to barf. My vivid imagination conjured images of my babbling on, my saying nothing, my walking weird, my ducking my head when he turned after I'd been staring at him weirdly. I mean, come on! I'm (real name undisclosed)! The girl that I am does not actually spend time with the people she crushes on. My real person isn't busy, or social, or whatever. It's so weird. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. There have been fundamental changes within myself, and suddenly I'm a different person, but I expect myself to be the same. Does this make any sense? I just feel so weird. There's no time to obsess over little bizarre nothings I used to make up to agonize over.  Anyway, when I was going to the movie I was all messed up. Natalia had very little tolerance for this, and pointed out that this wasn't a date, I was just going along with her while she saw her friends. And she was right. I came into the event with a certain view of things. Everything was about the BIL. The BIL! Ohmygod, I was going to see the BIL. If I hadn't been thinking like that, though, I would just have felt that I had a kick-ass time. If I think of things without the crush complicating it, then it seems that I had a wonderful time with one of my best friends and two of her incredibly funny acquaintances. I had a much better time than I would have with almost anyone else, and I told N. as much. Does this make any sense?  So, to sum up my weird-ass ramblings, I saw a movie with someone I like. He was quiet, a little, and so was I. We wore the same thing, weirdly, although his shoes were sneakers (I think), not girly sandals. Duh. All of us took turns snarking, or saying random things, or listening to the others speak. After the movie was over the four of us stayed after everyone else left. It is in fact possible to make handpuppet shows on the movie screen. It's also quite fun to laugh at the movie or laugh at the ads on the screen. Dude?- that movie pretty much sucked. Don't see it. Although, I might be biased. Through the entire second half I knew exactly how it was going to end, thanks to an unwelcome hint from Henna. That whole thing sparked one of the fights between us, but whatever.  Currently reading:  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe  by Douglas Adams. Have you ever heard of the  Hitchhiker's Guide  books? It's one of those. In places it's boring enough to make me want to drop it, but then a laugh-out-loud moment comes along and I remember why I like these books. In one part, the entire ship goes out of order during a Vogon attack because it (the ship) is trying to make a cup of tea. That, my friend, is fan-frickin'-tastic.  Currently watching:  Days of our Lives . Yes, I am once again hooked. Damn you, Sami and Lucas! I have an on-again, off-again relationship with this show, much like the one I have with Cheerios. I like it intensely for short periods of time, and then its natural idiocy asserts itself and I drop it once more. Then, an intriguing scene on one of my mom's tapes will catch my eye... and so on. And for the observant, I didn't contradict myself. I'm able to watch DOOL through the magic of the VCR, not through my sloth and empty lifestyle.  Currently surfing:  urlLink glarkware . My new job-induced 'wealth' is burning a hole in my pocket, and  urlLink these  and  urlLink this  are my new obsession. There are visions of button-earrings dancing in my head. And  urlLink these  shoes. They were in  Seventeen  and really looked way nicer there; this picture doesn't do them justice. I need them. I want them. I have no dress shoes. This isn't a figure of speech; I really have none except one pair of practical clunky ones my grandmother bought me. No offense, but these are on a whole other level. And God! In the tub! What incomprehensible genius! I need to go to bed now.  I'm probably going to be in Massachusetts tomorrow, so I won't post for at least a few days. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the monsters bite. Unless you're into that, in which case, go for it. See y'all later.
