      Which also sucked.  I have no idea what I'm waiting for in this grand new city of Spokompton, but whatever it is hasn't showed up yet.  If only I had initiative and motivation to go do something....

        Here's something really cool to me.&nbsp; When living in polson, I've never benched more than 160lbs.&nbsp; Two months into spokane, and now I can do 210.&nbsp; Hmm, strange coincedence?&nbsp; Oh, yeah, I'm also in a relationship with the woman of my dreams.&nbsp; THAT's pretty cool.&nbsp; I'm healthier, happier, and I have half of a clean respectable house to myself with a parent that I actually like.&nbsp; My friend Jenny moved here too and same thing.&nbsp; She goes to school for 9 freakin hours a week, has her own place and a great relationship going for her, not with that bastard dan.&nbsp; Polson SUCKS MY ASS!&nbsp; I wish Clarissa wasn't there.&nbsp; She should be here.&nbsp; Then everything would be perfect.

       with Clarissa because it's so hard to get her to express herself....I don't know if what anything I say or do is really sinking in, or if I'm doing anything wrong, or if I'm doing something right for that matter.&nbsp; She seems to think that my opinion of her is so fragile that to tell me what's up would really set it off....but....she hasn't understood that it won't...that that's what I really want....I want to feel like a working functioning couple that feels open enough to share these sort of things with eachother...and....I can't screw up with her....not her...she is balance to me, she is all that's beauty, she's earth air fire and water to me, and I want her to live without all those horrid barriers around her soul....I know I'm so far from perfect...but damn......you're just too good to be true....

      I just posted this and then it didn't go up...oh well...Went to Montana last week...it went by way too quickly though...Georgia just happened to  move the day after I got there so I never even saw her.....and other than that it was the same old bullshit...everyone always trying to get drunk or get high...pretty irritating..... On the plus side I stayed with Clarissa's family for most of the visit and got to ride back with them...and..it was really awesome...I just felt happy + calm about everything when I was around her....and trying to visualize the future...and how I can be a good man for her.....spending that time with her though really did make me happy I'm alive...for the first time....

      My birthday always ends up being one of the shittiest days of the whole year somehow(cept last year) and this one was no exception...just a usual day...only I got to hang out with my little brother for the majority of it (yay.) and got to go to a shitty as minor league baseball game with dad, david, and grandpa.  More joy, my grandpa is just a who-knows-how fuckin old version of my asshole dad.  I remembered why I never liked him.  It's ok though right?  I'm a year closer to death now, so that's one more behind me....*sigh*  the crazies won't leave me alone recently....well that's enough bitching for one week

      I just want to cut everyone's head off.  Well, everyone here, at least.  No one is on my side, and talking to them is like watching another version of them drop a noose around your neck.  I don't trust any of the bastards here, cept my guitar teacher.  Well shit, he's 23 and lives like 45 blocks straight uphill.  I just feel like hating myself, and everything in my surroundings recently, and it's getting a little tiring....the 'ol, ultra-negative bi polar seems to be kicking in......can't be THAT close to winter
