      Thanks to drugs (or more specifically Moss Pharmacy) I now have a chance in life. A chance to earn to some money, a chance to have a place of my own, a chance to find a girl, to marry, to settle down, to have kids, to eventually be resented by both wife and kids, to have my wife leave me (taking the kids), to only get to see my children once a month, to be crippled by alimony payments, to be evicted, to die alone in a gutter somewhere in Wolverhampton, with only a half bottle of Kosova and a ten pack of Lambert & Scrutler to keep me company...  Thank you drugs (Moss Pharmacy.)

      So I've got an interview for a job at a pharmacist tomorrow. In an odd way I feel quite excited, or maybe that's just desperation. If I'm honest, I'm not very good without imposed structure in my day. I know that sounds terribly boring and I should be a free thinking individual who can find things to do off my my own bat, but sadly I find it so much easier letting other people do it for me. Of course I have no urge to become a brain dead 'wage slave' - I did that solidly for year, the resultant effects not being dissimilar to a frontal lobotomy - but I get so frustrated when I'm not constantly occupied by something, ANYTHING. So yes, I need a job, but it doesn't look like I can afford to be too picky about what type of job I get - they don't want me as a librarian in Birmingham, they don't want me as a clerical administrator (office turd) at the council, they don't want me as a receptionist at Coventry Students' Union... the list goes on. So I'm quite excited about this interview for a job that's only 18 hours a week and pays the minimum wage...  You see, this is something I've probably got to stop now (my superiority complex that is.) I don't know where I get it from - perhaps it's born of 13 years of public school education... in fact it probably is... Anyway, it's what's kept me from signing on the dole, and until now, applying for jobs that pay an hourly rate. It has come as a bit of a shock though. Of course I always realised whilst at uni that I wouldn't walk straight off the course and into a 'graduate' job, but I did expect something more than this. Ho-hum. I suppose it's good to get the occasional dose of humility...

      Many people have told me that my degree is useless and, at least in a superficial sense, they’re right (it doesn’t help me get a job, it commands absolutely no respect and makes me look like a clown for spending in the region of £10k in fees and loans on it.) However, I have refused to be pessimistic and have attempted to ‘think outside the box’. The result of this cogitation is my Top Five Uses for an Apparently Useless Degree. I hope you enjoy and indeed, take inspiration from it as you too struggle to find uses for your BA (Bugger All) degree...     1. Silly hat    2. Incontinence pants    3. Litter scoop    4. Beer mat    5. Chip wrapper

      Admittedly I haven't been playing too much since I left university, but for the handful of people back in London who may still be vaguely interested, here's a taster of my recent half-arsed exploits on the West Midlands music scene...
