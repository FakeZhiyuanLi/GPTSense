      Companies know one thing, teens are easy targets. From Coca-Cola offering free mp3 downloads when purchasing their products ( which is pure crap ) to getting free mp3 players when signing up to cell phone plans, it's all an endless loop of nothing.  Teens are more vulnerable because they are easily convinced that having all these little gadgets (which companies make them believe they can't live without) will make them more "IN”. Take McDonald's for example which shows teens doing sports eating a super sized meal, why would anyone eat that crap, i mean that's all it is, and then society complains that teens are overweight and that there's an obesity problem, hello??   We need to feed our teen's minds and bodies with goodness and not crapiness. All we ever do is talk and talk and talk about issues and problems, how about actually doing something about it? The only reason nothing is being done is because of big corporations bringing in the big money and stopping at nothing to protect that money at a pretty hefty cost i may ad.  So you teens out there, stop and think about what companies really want from you, your well being? Most likely no, your buck? Most definatly yes, and they are willing to make you believe anything for it, even if it means ruining your mental and physical health to get it.

      From floating ads on the web to SMS messages on you personal cell phone, companies are desperate to get your buck.It's almost pathetic to see them go at it.To me these attemps to get consumers attention in any means necessary is a turnoff, who are they to tell me what i need, i know exactly what i need, and whenever i buy something, it's definatly not because of a web popup, i get loads of solicitation emails, you know what i do with them, i trash them, without sneeking a peek, to me the more a company tries to use these methods the more i ignore them.  Everywhere you look, boom, an ad.Being the freethinker that i am i've had to take extreme mesures, from not watching TV anymore to arriving late at the theaters just so i won't have to sit there and watch TV like commercials on a big screen.Where is all of this going? Mediatic chaos.  SykoPAT

      Ever watched the news? Of course you have, we all do. Now what seems to dominate news reports is murders and claims that certain foods or beverage can now cause cancer or some damn thing like that. Phrases like "What you don't know may kill you", the word Kill is probably to most used word in the media next to death and murder. All this repetitiveness has but one goal, to create fear within the public, why? Simple fear makes people vulnerable, to whom? Higher powers of course. Being Canadian i don't have to actually witness this to often, but in the states people are so deep in fear from the terrorist attacks to anthrax to gang violence that's it's hard for them to know what's real and what's not. And who comes to the rescue, Mr. Bush telling all Americans that his plans against "terrorism" will make the American public safe again. Safe he says? more like i’ll be able to manipulate you like i want now and pass laws that would of never passed before the inflicted fears. So open your eyes people to all these fake fears, life isn’t that complicate unless someone makes it complicate. Enjoy life, treasure it, embrace it, live it.  In conclusion i would like to raise my glass to a Mr. Michael Moore, an inspiration to all peace lovers and freethinkers.
