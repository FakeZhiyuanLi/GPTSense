       Just another Sunday  It's PC fair again. Well, i just went there today with my fren --- CK. What can i say about this year's event. Well... it's same old shit loh! There is this damn 'cun' chick... errr.. no! There are plenty of them... oooohhh.... Actually I don't feel going to PC fair one.. cos u can hardly get the attention from the people over there. I rather go to Low Yatt ... but.. but... PC fair got lot of chicks to feed my starving eyes.. hoo lah lah....! This time, I found that plenty of chicks dressed up like so 'I.T'.. so futuristic!! ( actually looks a bit Japs loh.. ) Well.. there is this chick... she was doing the promotion for R.O ( the online game that drives many many many people crazy lately )! What was fucking wrong with her huh?? What kinda costume she was wearing?? Damn it! She was wearing bra .. on top of her shirt.. well u know what? the bra ( i think it is a bra... it looks like a bra ) ..! it is only half bra which means bra only a single cup ( yup.. that's rite.. only the left side )!  This is a really queer way of wearing rite??? U may called it stylish also lah. But at least she got this Jap looks... hahaha I like her legs though...  :p At the top floor, we passed by a booth. Juz can't remember what is the booth's name! Nyeh! What ever it is! Ok...  inside there got a group of hot chicks dressed in red! If we see this booth from far, all we can see is a hooker centre. But actually, these chicks doin' the Palm PC business! But no kidding, this is the only booth that have this great amount of chicks with high quality. Hehehehehe.... What?? hey i know wat u guys are thinkin' mmmkay... I went there not only for those chicks  mmmkay... I bought an optical mouse! Well... u see... my buddy Kenny he said my mouse  sucks... so i bought this new mouse loh. hehehe Oh yah... forgot that my left thumb got hit by CK car's door. OOOUuuuchh it hurts. but i strongly believe it will be okay very soon. hahahah

       Sad...  Talkin' about friendship maitenance, it can be really tough! Sometimes we need certain skills to maintain a connection with someone [ but unfortunately not everyone was born with such skills! :(  ] ! I don't know what else to write cos i just feel bad that a friend of mine just ended his friendship with someone. Of course both of them are my friends and one of them is even my buddy! I still remember that my buddy told me this :"When you are my friend then forever u are. That's mean I already accept who you are!" but now ....sigh No matter what happens I have to accept this lo... hope that both of them will be happy for current state!   Well, another thing is try to share problems with friends.... It is unhealthy to burden yourself with problems that u might not be able to cope with  ( ya.. may be u think u manage to solve it on ur own! ) !!! Speak it out and it will set you free! We tell others our 'inner thoughts' doesn't mean that we think our 'secrets' are very 'big' and important enough to let the world knows it! Let me put it this way : I will act very weird when I encouter some problems.. my face is like 'shit'... don't feel like talk to others... friends talk to me and i give them no response etc..   After a while my friends sure will think that I am an ass hole.. cos I was too RUDE to them.. but did they know my problems..?? So hor... let others know ur problems first la and then ur buddies will  know y u act in such a way! Not only that, encouragement from friends are very very important! But I understand that some guys tend to act like so macho!!! They thought sharing secrets or problems are only done by girls. So they won't say a word about what their problems are... but acted very very RUDE one... Well i talked too much liao... hehehe hope u all know what i m trying to say la

Sigh... lately i used to listen to Blue's latest song Guilty and found that the lyrics is so.... errr how to say arr... suit my mood.. as i listen to it... i got some kinda queer feeling la!!!! hahahah   I never want to play the games that ppl play, i never want to hear the things they gotta say! I've found everything i need. I never wanted anymore that i can see.  I only want u to believe. If it's wrong to tell the truth. Then WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? When all i want to do is to speak my mind. If it's wrong to  do what is right. I'm ready to testify. IF LOVING U WITH ALL MY HEART IS A CRIME... Then I'M GUILTY!!!! I wanna give u things that u never had. DON'T TRY TO TELL ME HOW HE TREAT U ISN'T BAD. I need u back in my life. I never want to be the another guy. I never wanted to live a lie. If it's wrong to tell the truth. Then WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? When all i want to do is to speak my mind. If it's wrong to  do what is right. I'm ready to testify. IF LOVING U WITH ALL MY HEART IS A CRIME... Then I'M GUILTY!!!!  hoo la la.... it's a nice song really and yet a really sad song to me........ hmmmm I knew dat she has got someone. I will not give the fella sand funeral or coffin like harpreet cos i m not a samurai and i understand that when it's urs then it's urs, if it's not urs..... just let go lo wat da heck...  *_* urrrghhh.. i hate to say dis... urrrghhh

But leh i think the efficiency is goin to be low loh... wonder how much my brain absorbed... I was sweating like hell, so i went online... chat with Janice-chan for a while and then we both went off. Suddenly something hit me... in my brain. A lot of things to think again.. wah lau.. Can't take it anymore. Suddenly I got an idea... so i quickly change my clothes and then rush to KLCC and bought a ticket for Paycheck. It was a 7pm show. hehehe... yup.. yet again .. i watch the show alone. hahaha  It was a typical John Woo's film. So u can see pigeons flying from nowhere... (cos i still cannot figure out how the pigeon got into the building...sigh ) and then 2 guys pointing pistols at each other... kick-ass figthing scenes... wonderful vehicles chasing scenes... hahaha Do u like Minority Reports? Paycheck is something like that oso loh... what the heck.. both shows are based on the short stories by Philip K Dick ( I m not really a sci-fi geek la... ok.. ) lah... but still... i can see the resemblance between them.... even from the start of the show.. :p u guys go n explore lah..  Well.. after watchin the show.. feel better now.. hehehee....  one more thing is... if i were michael jennings (ben affleck) then hor i will try to erase my memory ... i want to rub all my past memories from start of adv first yr till now...... but i know that is impossible because i know that certain things I might need aeon of light yrs to forget one...... sigh again....

       Naruto Fever  Suddenly.. i m readin Naruto... Actually i m not a keen admirer of Naruto until Ryoko mentioned it to me before this i dunno a shit about this manga! What a surprise that Ryoko really interested in Naruto cos i tot gals should only like those romance comics mah.. Naruto is about Ninja and ninjutsu.. so wondering how she developed interests in this so called world most popular manga... even in the friendster she posted the Naruto pics instead of her pics... what the heck! One more thing is .. duno whether she likes naruto or sasuke... naruto is like sakuragi hanamichi and sasuke is like rukawa kaede in slam dunk... normally gals will like rukawa cos he is cool... so hor in naruto.. sasuke is as cool as rukawa.. alot of chicks should like him lah... i must ask ryoko one day.. she prefers naruto or sasuke... heheheh

       Triumph in The Skies  hehehee... guess what? I've watched  the first episode of TVB series of the Yr "Triumph in The Skies" or 冲上云霄! Well, the casting is so good! Really! Alot of famous celebrities in this 40 episodes series. It is abt pilot! Oh.... can say it is just a parody of Jap popular drama "Good Luck" featuring Kimura Takuya! But the difference is... HK version is much more longer and fast paced! Compared to "Good Luck" which only has 12 episodes.... hahaha secondly is the casting loh... HK version is much more bigger!!!!  I got a message from the very first episode! DESTINY!!!!!! 缘分! When a thing is urs then it is urs.... predestined!!!!! sigh...

       Games Machine  Leo Ku's latest cantonese album ---- Games Machine. When I first looked at the songs,   found that their names are very interesting (just match with the title n concept of the   album), eg : fatality attacks, god of love, go ku, fighting eleven, crying nintendo etc.   (names of games, games characters etc) Then I tot these songs will be techno or dance songs... but i was wrong. Surprisingly, they   are all love ballads... sentimental...!! I like it...!!! Today is my fren's birthday, so we celebrate at neway karaoke. This is the third time we   go there! But we prefer redbox even the service in neway is better. hehee... shit loh..   since when 'visit karaoke' become my weekly activity liao...hehe

       hi hi minasan (hi hi everyone)  I juz came back from Kuala Terengganu. Well, seems like everybody is talkin about the election thingy nowadays. I m feeling so good to see the falls of PAS in my hometown. PAS only won 3 small little parts in Terengganu n those parts were all 'hulu' or kampung nia.. no wonder they were so furious and causing so many problems after the election. I juz can't fathom that y they still wanna kacau kacau! U know what, those ppl gathered at the Bangunan Darul Iman (a building where our MB and etc work and keep the classified documents). This building is located less than 1KM from my house nia... around 2000 Pas Fans gathered outside the building and wanna get into the building... i also dunno for wat... hitting ppl lah... burn dunno what kinda shit la.... (cos i dare not to go there n have a look.. i just try to watch from my house nia... from my front room i can see them...) I think that they tot they will never lost in the election so hor they haven't 'remove' all the 'confidential' documents belongs to them from the building yet... hehe.. but of course the BN people already sealed the building liao... not far from now i think many PAS ppl will be caught for bribery lah... selling land to other countries lah.. hahha who knows rite? may be all those important documents are still kept in the building... hehehe  alot of policemen and 'ang tao peng' or red-headed soldiers came out to stop them. they are so stupid cos the police station just located outside the building nia.. haha so they tried so hard to runaway loh.. what a chaos... i was so scared when i see all these from my house (i stay in a flat, 3rd floor... so is considered safe.. haha).. alot of ppl kena langgar by cars n motorcycles hahaha... ooopsss i shouldn't laugh at them... but see ... what happen to them? they know they cannot regain the authorities liao... but still wanna fight against BN... so stupid n now they are suffering. and the reason they gave lagi stupid... i m sure u all read the newspaper rite.... the next day hor lagi teruk... they call 'yao'.. a group of PAS Supporters from Kelantan came here to help... but this time they a bit clever liao... no more gathering outside the building which near to a police station.. haha.. they moved their camp to Merchang one of the malay kampung in the state. It is too far away from my house liao.. so dunno what they did over there. But i heard they also hitting ppl and doing some burning over there... sigh.. sorry can't help! Well.... now i m back to KL safely.... hope that they will not continue they devils act until my family gets hurts....

       Love Collage  I think I bought this vcd for quite some time already, but I didn't get a chance to watch it. Well, finally I watched it juz now. Love Collage is Ryoko Hirosue's latest movie also featuring Ryuhei Matsuda and Yukihiko Tsutsumi. It is all about  Makoto (Ryuhei) n his 'Mysterious' lover Shizuru (Ryoko). They break up bcos of a silly reason. One day, Makoto received a letter from Shizuru, attached with some collages. At the same time, he get to know that Shizuru was murdered in New  York. So, he left for NY to find out ....  the funny part is when Makoto speaks English.... haha... if there is no subtitle provided, I really dunno what was he talking about... i didn't get it... the pronunciation is damn NICE!!! Yet again, Ryoko is so so so so cute..... hehehe... well this movie is directed by the director who directed  the Jap pop series --- Good Luck.

       Finish  Triumph in The Skies! The series is a bit too long (40 episodes). Actually, it is only about love stories. It is quite simple series. So it will be better if it is around 20 episodes. Series like Chong Sai Gei or Lau Gam Sui Yuet etc need 40 or more episodes cos their stories are a bit complicated. Too simple liao....

       書中的說話  Chap 2 朋友! 你好嗎? 你還在嗎? 依舊聽到你的聲音,每日看著你的影畫, 仿佛一切仍像昨天一點沒差, 你說過的話, 你喝過的這一杯茶, 安在桌上,記在心間. 朋友! 你好嗎? 在想我嗎? 聽說你能透過夢境來傳你的話, 若是真的, 請來舍下, 聚聚舊, 可以嗎? 聽說那邊風景很美, 有鳥有花, 若是真的, 我這心也終可放下. 朋友!你好嗎? 我在想你, 你知道嗎? 安息吧!

       書里的說話  Chap 1 我夢見我飛,我卻還是站在地上; 我夢見怪獸追上將我吃掉, 卻只見兒是自己, 兩行眼淚, 呆坐床上; 我見我飛黃騰達,卻發現原來自己兩手空空; 我見我高朋滿座, 卻是身邊友人一一離我而去; 我看見前路風平浪靜, 轉眼又風高浪急; 明明是陰暗絕路, 又是柳暗花明; 幸福像垂手可得,卻又遙不可及; 美還是醜,善抑或惡; 孰是真,孰是假? 像是得,卻是失! 所有以為掌握的,最終不由我說. 一切眼前真實,最後化作輕煙溜走. 人生是夢,夢亦人生!

       Album review  Finally, most awaited Jacky's flagship album has landed in malaysia this  afternoon! The first batch will be the limited edition (imported from HK)! It  comes with a book. There will be collages with some articles written by Jacky  while making the album. The articles are meaningful as he alr 40+ yr old, he  was dealing with a lot of problem within this 40yrs. There is an article  really touchin... he wrote for his daughter! May be I never listen to his  canto songs for 3 yrs (the previous canto album is called THE BEST IN THE  WORLD released in 2001). So, i really missed his voice! Really I found the  album is really good cos he composed and produced all the songs. He really  really good in singing that is y he is hailed as the best male vocalist.  There is some feeling that i must explain in chinese...   久違了,歌神! 三年了, 我足足等了三年!終於,它于今午正式登陸大馬了!香港于二十日 便有得買了!甚至我們的鄰居新加坡二十一日便全城熱賣!大馬卻遲遲未見其蹤影!終於今 天二十八日于大馬面世了!為何專輯會命名(Life is like a dream)?也許是因為他已經 踏入中年階段了!歷經了風風雨雨,對他而言,人生?一場夢而已!從隨輯附送的 "書"作者 當然是學友啦!理頭所有的文章都極有意思!對於歌曲方面,學友亦交足了功課!對於是一 個善于唱歌,鮮少寫歌,又不是唱作人出道的學友來說,他的創作已是"可以見得人"了!也 許音樂度和豐富度不比周杰倫來得高,甚至還比其上一張大牒 "天下第一流" 的音樂度來 得更低!但勝在風格夠鮮明!真的有別于其以往的專輯 (以商業主打或K歌歌曲為主)!單看 曲目的安排便可見一斑!真正的主打"講你知" 竟然排到最後第二track!並不是說第一到 第八track的歌曲不堪入耳, 只是較易消化的,學友式的情歌大牒內就只有"講你知"最為 接近了!也說明了學友的野心和心機!他要我們別只廳那些較商業化的主打歌!也要留意那 些非主打!當然主打歌是不可缺少的!學友的歌藝如何?可能是我太想念他的歌聲了,所以 聽此大牒時,覺得學友的歌聲異常動聽!似乎恢復了水準!尤其是他演繹一些關于人生的歌 曲時格外有味道!棒極了!也許全都是他的創作所以首首都有學友的味道!此專輯純屬慢熱 大牒!不會只聽一遍便會愛上的專輯!是需要時間來消化的一張專輯!要知道製作屬於自己 的專輯並非一件易事!總結是,遺憾+高興! 遺憾的是專輯里沒有了 "只想一生跟你走" 式 和非常學友式的情歌! 高興的是學友晉升唱作人一族了!讚!!!!! 曲目有: 1.勇敢的故事 (警訊主題曲) 2.想劈酒 3.燥狂 4.Life is like a dream 5.慢條斯理 6.她 7.給朋友 (給所有已故的朋友知己) 8.寧願做錯 9.講你知 (給愛妻的歌) 10.搖瑤 (給女兒的歌)

Sing by Asian kungfu generation!! the lyrics : (full version)  fumikomuze akuseru kake hikiwa naisa sou dayou youru wo nukeru nejikomu sa saigo ni sashihiki zero sa sou dayou hibi wo kezuru kokoro wo sotto hiraite gyutto hiki yosetara todokuyo kitto tsutau yo motto sa aaa iki isoide shiboritotte mostureru ashi dakedo mae yori zutto sou tokue ubaitotte tsukan datte kimi jya nai nara imi wa naniosa dakara motto motto motto haruka kanata fumikomuze akuseru kake hiki wa naisa sou dayo youru wo nukeru nejikomu sa saigo ni sashihiki zero sa sou dayou hibiwo kezuru kokoro wo sotto hiraite gyutto hiki yosetara todokuyo kitto tsutau yo motto sa aaa iki isoide shiboritotte motsureru ashi dakedo mae yori zutto sou tokue ubaitotte tsukandatte kimi jya nai nara imi wa naniosa dakara haruka kanata itsuwaru ko  do ni nareta  kimi no sekai wo murizubusu  no sa shiroku  shirou   the translation line by  line is :  Hit the gas!  There's no need to finagle, oh yeah! We'll go all through the night. I'll complain at the end, the balance is zero, oh yeah! We'll whittle the days away... When you open your heart a little, and pull someone close to you, Your feelings will surely reach them deeper, yeah... Hurry it up!  Wring it out! Though my legs are all tangled, they will surely take me far... Even if I steal it and manage to grasp it, If it isn't you, then what's the point? So I'll go further and further away! Hit the gas!  There's no need to finagle, oh yeah! We'll go all through the night. I'll complain at the end, the balance is zero, oh yeah! We'll whittle the days away... When you open your heart a little, and pull someone close to you, Your feelings will surely reach them deeper, yeah... Hurry it up!  Wring it out! Though my legs are all tangled, they will surely take me far... Even if I steal it and manage to grasp it, If it isn't you, then what's the point? So I'll go far into the distance... Your world will become a thing of deceit painted all in white...    Hellboy  Zan nen desune.... Not as good as ive expected. May be I m not an american n seldom read the guai lou 'manga'! Hellboy ... he tried to be cool in the movie but for me i dun think he is cool loh... dunno leh... spider man is cool.... batman also cool... but not hellboy! Yeah, he tried to make himself funny with all those 'jokes' but rob schneider can do better than him wor!... he is big i must admit this, but he can't move fast even he is macho.... this is y the box office in the US also not really impressive! Yeah every super heroes storylines are cliche... so the hellboy's story also sucks (ive expected this liao....) abit boring.... since it can't move fast.. so the fighting scenes.... sigh... not to mention anymore. Even villains can fight better.. he won because of his 'made-of-steel' body n his unlimited strength only lo... just like the hulk lo!!!!

       First paper!  Com com..... internal paper.... juz now 530pm... small keong sat beside me (i only realized this when the they started collecting our answer sheets)... siew meng sat behind me.... scored A is impossible... cos i not study that thoroughly... for ppl who can really memorize every sentence from the text book.. sure can get A ..... this is the first time i never depends on tips.... i tried very hard to stuff everything into my head... but somehow my head not that big to accomodate all that... and most of the brain cell is made of RAM not ROM.... can't keep longer!!! another factor is may be caused by 'aging' problem.. i m old enough to be daddy rite now.... not suitable to study anymore... or my flair in study is the lowest.... blame myself lo..........

       Again...  Juz came back from yam cha. It was my friend who asked me out juz now. So, I met Ryoko again. Not to say 'met' cos we didn't really meeting n not even greeting. I was talking with my friends, n suddenly one of my fren said : "faster, look behind! Damn chun man the gal.... bla bla bla"  So I tried to look back n see how Chun the gal was. At the very minute I turn my head to the back, gosh.... i saw a pair of familiar eyes.... i speak to myself :"not that lucky gua..." yup.. is her! I dunno for how long I've being staring at her juz now. I couldn't describe how i feel.. is kinda weird.... but she is still attractive like she used to be. I bet my fren doesn't know her... sigh i also dun wanna tell them about it too. it was january  when i last see Ryoko... n now i know how much i missed her... ... ... ...  is like that one... if i never get to see her then nvm one... but once saw her liao hor.... everything coming back again... damn it!!!!

       Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell - 2 Pandora Tomorrow  Yup! Once again u will be playing Sam Fisher in his stealthing business. This game just released last week. Errr.... I mean the pirated one which is affordable to me. Well, I bought the DVD version since it is a 4-CDs game so it's gonna cost me alot if buying the CD version. Well, what's new about this highly-rated game?? Of course the graphics are gorgeous and the textures are really 'cun'! So what does it means? It means u need a good graphic card to run this game, at least u need a GeForce 4 Titanium card. My advice is run it with GeForce FX series card! If u only got GeForce 4 Titanium card, then simply forget about it unless u can bear the 'lagging' stuffs. The processor gonna be at least 1GHz ok... gosh... the game start where u're in the East Timor... u gonna fight against the Indonesian guerillas! The graphics were so impressive... there is a part where  i would need to stealth through the bushes... whoooaaahhh... the grass.. the trees... damn happening man!!! there is many more improvements  in gameplay such as we can straight away carry the corpse with one hand n another hand open the door (which we are unable to do that in splinter cell 1), no longer need to find softdrink cans for enemy attractions cos we can whistle to catch their attentions now, the increase of dialogue n its content sometimes quite interesting....etc The conclusion is faster go n buy the game and explore for urself! Worth playing dudes!!!

       Naruto  Before this i used to read Naruto comics but since few months ago i started to watch its animations.... then i know liao... the animations are much more better than the comics... the comics are extremely hard to read and sometimes irritate my eyes... cos the pictures are damn small and the way the artist draw are fucking dirty!!!!! sometimes i juz cannot figure out wat the hell is he drawing... so watch animation version of naruto.. dun read its comicS!!

       Juz can't wait  After years of waiting... finally my favourite singer of all time Jacky Cheung will release his latest cantonese album... already 2 years lo Jacky not making his cantonese album. I m kinda missing him! About this coming album... he made the greatest breakthrough! He composed every song in the album n wrote 3 songs' lyrics. hehe suddenly he becomes a composer and song writer liao! juz can't wait man... well... i have read one of his new song's lyrics "gong nei ji" (telling u) which he wrote this song for his wife! u all can read it at www.coolmanmusic.com too... hahaha!!!! Juz hard to believe that he really go and 'make' his OWN album! but i know he can play guitar well as i already witnessed his kick-ass performance in the concert in bukit jalil 5 years ago.... he also wrote one song for 'brother' Leslie Cheung (to commemorate leslie) and one for his daugther as well ...etc the album name is 'life is like a dream' so hor i think the album is gonna be a 'concept' album liao.. like what is happening in hong kong music industry now... everyone is doing concept album.. such as edmund leung hon mun, leo ku, tang kin wang... etc hahah he needs great powers of conception to make this album... so i will support him n buy original cd... errr heheheh actually since last time liao all his album i bought original one... hahaha... wat the heck@!!!!

      so happy! Manchester United finally added another silverware into their cabinet! The devils apparently too strong for the lions! Juz look that match stats... from the number of corner kicks we have! It was surely a one way match! we have at least 12 corners where the lions only had less than 5! We shld have scored at least 5 goals man.... Look at our rising stars Darren Fletcher and Cristiano Ronaldo! Especially the latter! He just getting better n better n better.... how skillful for a lad only at the age of 19! Final score is 3-0 whr Ronaldo scored the opener and nistelrooy scored twice and later being named as player of the match!

       This few days  This few days really tiring! I went to SS14/2 for an interview n it turns out a bit dissapointing! Not because the job is not good. I quite like it since it is about web designing stuffs...! BUT! Somehow, the environment.. the surroundings not really attract me! Well, i can hardly go there as i dun hv any own transport (dun mention my old motorbike.. it can't travel that far!)! Hv to take lrt to kl sentral and then change to ktm... take it to subang jaya (just behind carrefour) and then... dunno which bus to take (ask ppl .. ppl also dunno!)... only way is take a cab loh! Strange thing is even the taxi driver also dunno whr the place (or he is a great deceiver!!!!)... eating me only! nvm nvm... at last spent  rm15 for the cab n found it.. not found that company! I found chee keong's car! How pathetic! The words "gloco solutions sdn bhd" is really BIG enough!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  nvm nvm... i went up loh.. n meet Alex.... the boss! Talk to him so long...i was given some sort of attitude tests... sorry kenny! sorry for u my buddy! That Alex saw our flash assignment and said something bad about it! sigh....   nvm.. when he describes my job... sigh... is sales n marketing staff..... more on that then web designer! N only pay me 1300!  I was given an assignment.. to build a website for the company! I was given nearly a week time!   well... this morning.. he called and ask me to send him before sunday pulak (suppose to be on tuesday)! what the!!! chee keong was right.. alex .. everything kena rush one! sigh... just now my fren called me... he said his company (citibank) is recruiting new ppl.. for the post of... mortgage or customer service or credit cards etc....basic is 1500-1800 ! the thing caught my attention is ... is at ampang park only! i can reach there easily one!!!! not even 15 minutes by the train! I like it! so i think i will drop the ss14/2 job liao.... hahah see... both also do sales and marketing... y not i choose the one convenient to me .. correct or not! but i will still design the thing for him and send him on sunday! juz to show him that i keep my promise! hope that he will forgives me lah. if the company is near my place.. i will work for him one...... i really dun wanna move to subang jaya lah.... so mah fun if next time quiting the job then how? move again? chi xin! and public bank calling me also.. what the.. located at Bangi! lagi teruk man... cindy (the gal called me for interview) say if i dun hv a car.. better dun come cos too inconvenient! dun even have bus go there one.... all i can do is take lrt to the mines n take taxi which will cost me at least rm10! lagi chi xin leh.... so i din turn up for the interview... wat a waste... is a analyst programmer job!

       Kimura's pride    Kimura Takuya! You will definitely know him if u like to watch Jap dramas! He stopped making dramas for quite some time alr (hehehe... coz he needs to spend more time with his wife and his little baby daughter.... he is a rookie being a daddy.. more to learn!). After being a pilot.. now he is the rising star in JHL (Japan Hockey League)... ice hockey! I like the soundtrack of this drama... it's so UHMMMM! Full of energy! While the actress for this drama is Takeuchi Yuko hehehe quite pretty this gal! Juz can't accept the Japs thinking! Especially Kimura who sees LOVE as a game only! What the hell! In this movie, yuko plays the role as an very very ordinary OL (her bf went overseas n lost contact for many years liao.. but she keeps on waiting... ) so kimura will be her temporary lover while she is waiting for his bf! They both agreed to "smile n say good bye" when yuko's bf is back! Can be like this one meh? sigh....

       Jiang Hu  Not bad!!! It was violent enough but unfortunately Malaysian Censorship board .. sigh... so  if u really wanna watch a 'complete' show... wait for dvd... Even though Jacky Cheung acted as a gangster b4 this... but still.. this time quite impressive! In this movie.. he is so mad... so cruel.. so arrogant.... nice acting... i think he is sure to be nominated for next hong kong academy awards!!! Andy Lau... his acting is okay... may be I ve seen so many his movie alr so no surprises from him! Another surprise  ive got is Edison.... acting skills improved liao... another promising actor is Yu Mun Lok loh.... but he was carrying the shadows of his previous character in Infernal Affairs.... Chan Chee Wai n fellows.... only the extras.... the dialogues btw Andy n Jacky is the main point in the show.... very interesting! worth watching... i m waiting for the dvd.. cos alot of parts being cut off liao... SIGH malaysia boleh!

       All in  I seldom watch Korean and taiwanese dramas cos they always come in plenty of episodes and  too slow! This time i back here in terengganu n saw my mom actually watching Korean drama-- All In. I dunno it has how many episodes altogether... i juz watch a few lo i think nearly  ending liao... hahah even i only watch a few episodes i roughly can get what the whole story  is all about! Sigh.... nvm nothing what.. juz to see leng cai and leng lui only mah....  this few days i helped my frens and auntie buy and setup pc... and found that doing computer business in here can earn u big bucks one! the competition is too low... hahaha u can put the price high high and yet still got ppl buying! the hardware like mainboards, soundcards.... even  processors... not up to date one and the technician really 'professional' one! I went there to buy AMD processor.. they said in terengganu nobody playing AMD! what the heck... but then they said if i want. they can get me AMD Barton 2600+ ... other than that..they dun have liao. so i get this amd barton 2600+ loh... when choosing mainboard they recommend me the gigabyte board. since i m using gigabyte rite now n no problem thus far, so i said ok loh.. but i ask them to make sure it can support my processor... they said no problem! so i paid and bring it home loh! when i try to run the bios , cmos... the whole thing jammed! i seek for their help loh, they said is the keyboard problem wor.. what the hell r they talking about...! when running cmos and bios the machine hang... they said is something wrong with the keyboard! i argue with them but they won't listen! i left the thing with them ... they took 2 days to test it.. Fxxx 2 days and say is the processor problem... then 'down grade' the processor to 2500+ and now running smoothly! I can see alot of customers still coming in to buy pc from them... u know the price is damn 'reasonable'somemore... haha

       Becks's blunders...  Missed 2 stupid penalties in the tournament! What can i say about this? Sigh... really sad about this! But it is not a correct way to put all blames on him about the england's exit! He is playing alrite that day.. passing.. shooting... he passed alot of balls... he shoots and the figure juz behind Owen. This is the fate! Anyway, he should think of another way to take the penalty kick on a 'pretty' pitch! Sad.. Sad... world cup will be held in the next 2 yrs.. hope that he can bring england further...!  Y i can online? since i dun have any pc at home... eheheh.. actually i help my aunt to set up a pc... then i can use it to surf the net looh.... hahaha  anyway i ll be back to KL on wednesday morning... thursday got interview.. and then after that i might be goin to singapore to look for my brother and cousins....  see u all then... ya must watch spidey 2 when back in KL later..

       on leave  This morning when I woke up, shit! sore throat! So can't work today! I called the HR department and apply for leave loh... wat else?! A telemarketer can do nothing in company if he can't talk! hahaha so i better stay at home loh!   F.I.R  Last nite I went to BRJ again... hehehe.... visit the 'black market' again loh! Lately, my brother, he kept telling me how nice is F.I.R ! ... etc! But i dun have the opportunity to listen to their songs... then hor i met another fren of mine via the ICQ she also kept mention about F.I.R! So, i can't tahan liao... juz wanna find out what is so good about this F.I.R! Well, so.... last nite i bought their album from the black market loh. After i ve listened the whole album, found that out of my expectations.... they are not really a rock band, in fact they make alot of sentimental music! Why FIR? cos F stands for Faye (vocal), I stands for Ian and R stands for Real. Is a 2 guys and 1 gal band! They reminds me of Japanese group----Do As Infinity! but Faye sounds like Shino! anyway... their songs are good.... worth listening! hope they will write more Rock music!   Marion Caunter  Marion... my favourite malaysia female tv host! she is so cute and sometimes sexy too.... here is some of her photos... thanks to my buddy---- kenny who found these photos for me!

      聽過那個傳說嗎？耳朵癢的時候，是有人在想你 但是，有時候，我很想念一個人，我不會打電話給她。因為，打電話給她，不知道說甚麼好，還是不打比較好。 不是嗎？你打電話給一個許久不見面的她。 過去，和她也沒通過電話. 現在若是打給她，話題會一直在原地打轉，還是那些無謂的噓寒問暖，那些無關緊要的事，那種感覺並不好受。 所以，我就算想念她，也不會打電話給她。 這樣吧！打電話給她，就是那句「你好嗎」﹔可是，她身邊有另一個人了，又說些甚麼好呢？既然這麼久沒聯絡了，就別再聯絡了吧！ 單戀，或許失意且悲傷,但我仍毅然決然，演得很灑脫，就算只是堅強偽裝，但那至少很漂亮吧！如此難得，何必因為那偶爾憶起的思念，破壞那一刻的回憶？  想念一個人，不一定要看見她的模樣，不一定要聽到她的聲音。因為真實接觸後，也許就是另一回事。 耳朵好癢，你在想我嗎？我很想你，卻如何也鼓不起勇氣，寫信給你。 想念你，不找你……。

Michael also like that... what the hell.... may be they are born to be in the sales and marketing field..! they will have great future in the company! good luck to them! Today i just manage to close only 1 sales.. pathetic leh... but wat to do ... all customers seems like fooling me around today... ask alot of questions... gave all the buying signals but ended with not buying anything from me....! Tomorrow lagi teruk! cos the manager Dharma.... he announced juz now where tomorrow will be pajamas day.... he doesn't wants to see anyone of us dress in formal attire tomorrow..all must wear pajamas... so just now i gave rm20 to Johan n asked him to get me a pajamas for tomorrow event! cant imagine that tomorrow every staffs are wearing pajamas and walk here n there in the company! must me very funny one.. hehehe

       Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code   This few days in kt, i hv more time to read the book. I think will finish it another 3 days.  About the book. Well, as i was reading it, i hope that it will one day shows on the big screen n  i was discussing about it with kenny few days ago. haha but i think the story is a bit controversial, or too controversial i might say! if it is made into movie, surely many ppl will  dispute about the issues mentioned in the book. when i first reading the book, i thought it is merely about how Robert Langdon n Sophie Neveu (main characters) reveal the truth about Da Vinci's works, the meaning behind all his arts. But, now i m reaching the final parts n discovered that the book is talking about the TRUTH of the Christ! hahaha for me is okay la.. i enjoyed every twist in this book, but i think for christians... they might find this book is scary bcos christianity is full of politics (every religions also the same)... hahaha  see... what if the bibles ppl r reading rite now r altered from the true story?  what if the Christ is only a very strong MAN n not GOD-like?  what if the Holy Grail is not a cup but a HUMAN?  what if the Christ was a FATHER?  What if Mary Magdalene the WHORE was the Christ's WIFE?  what if Mary Magdalene was among the 12 disciples during the last supper?.... etc   blah blah blah.... anyway... i m not knowledgeable enough so that i m not sure about all this!  I know... it is only a fiction from Dan Brown... but he makes them sound REAL (as i said  i m NEW to all these).. hahaha  Well, i guess the next book i m going for will be Angels And Demons, also from Dan Brown!

The whole movie...80% of the dialogues were in Hokkien.... singaporean hokkien.. for those who can't speak hokkien.. sure mati.. sure boring.. sure can't get the joke! but i laughed untill nearly puke in the cinema with my frens.... hahahhah worth watching man... really funny !

       Singapore  If not mistaken, my last visit to Singapore was 3 yrs ago whr i attended my cousin's wedding and saw many japanese leng cai leng lui cos my cousin get married with a jap gal. Sigh, missed 'em alot cos i never seen them since then. Well, this time i also got no chance to meet my cousin's wife Natsumi-chan and their son Kohei cos they r now in Seoul. Anyway i still met other cousins etc... i stayed in their place wat.. hehehe Singapore is still as clean as 3 yrs ago.... Malaysian .... learn from all the kiasu kings and queens here lah... keep ur country pls.... we went to watch Lindsay Lohan's movie --- Mean Girls at Somerset's Cathay cinema. What the... the cinema was so so so gorgeous... again .... no vandalism here! Malaysian... learn from 'em lah pls...! Well, the movie was nice, funny.. and more importantly can see lotsa pretty gals...! I also went to Bugis street (Singapore's petaling street) and go to Sim Lim Square (Singapore's Low Yatt)... help my cousin to set up a pc loh... frankly speaking the price wasn't that low if compared to malaysia... for certain parts were even more expensive aaahh! And their taste is slightly different from us loh... in Low Yatt for a particular shop and for a particular hardware, we are provided with many choices .. many brands but not in singapore...  what i wanna say is less choice for us....  For other electrical appliances leh? really cheap! stuffs like mp3 player... discman.. digi cam.. whoaaahhhh cheap man..  but i afraid of being caught at the customs so i not buying any of 'em. But when i was leaving for KL, the customs not checking my luggage, nothing! Sigh..... i shld have buy at least a digi cam ..... bugger! but "if can know early, then no beggar"... this chinese phrase is playing in my mind now! regret ooo... next time loh... Another interesting story is... when i first reached at singapore custom... heheh after they scanned my luggage... they stop me. One of 'em even shout :"Hooiii! check this guy! VCD!" everyone around me were looking at me man... so pai seh! then i unzipped my bag and let 'em check loh... actually i burn alot of softwares for my cousins.. since singapore no pirated cd liao.. heheh but i din label the cds... so they asked me loh :"What is this? Mp3? movie?"  then i told them :"data loh..."    they asked again :"what sort of data?"    well... i replied :"homework lah..." hahaha.. then another guy whispered to his partner and then guess what.. they finally let me passed HAHAHAHA!!!! actually... the un-labelled cds, i purposely let them see one cos important thing (dvds and vcds) still inside another secret pocket in my luggage... hahaha.. so i succesfully brought in pirated dvds and vcds into singapore... what the hell.. i tell myself no more next time! i sweating like hell lah...  my cousin also told me... singapore gov fight pirated vcd and dvd especially movies like fighting the drug dealers lah... if i kena tangkap... "hand tail" very long one!!! hahaha Der Fah also came and look for me on Saturday nite... we have a great chat and dunno when i can meet him again loh...sigh I bought a HK series in singapore.. is abt Mystery Investigation story... quite scary and nice! cos can see lotsa ghosts.. spirits.... hehehe
