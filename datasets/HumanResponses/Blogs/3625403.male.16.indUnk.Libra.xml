      So I just saw the new Harry Potter. I'm not the biggest fan of the series, just a casual movie-watcher with very, very little interest in the books. I have to say I enjoyed this one more than the other two, but I still wouldn't say it was AMAZING. I still can't think of it as little more than fantasy for children, although it involves more death than I expected.  Onto more mature fantasy. I've also just finished the first book in Terry Goodkind's  Sword of Truth  series,  Wizard's First Rule . I originally heard about this series through a family friend a couple years ago, and only recently picked up a couple when I was at Chapters. Another customer saw me looking at WFR, and told me she thought the series to be as good as Tolkien, and that was the last bit of encouragement I needed. It's definitely an unique and interesting series, and not for the light of heart at some points - there's some moments of highly detailed gore, and "adult" situations. If you can stomach all the gory details of a sword slicing through a man, and some talk of rape and molestation, you should give this series a try. I'm about to begin the next book,  Stone of Tears .   "There's holes up in the sky/The devil punched down to the monkeys..."

      So as I've said, the new Matt Good album came out today, so of course I rushed to the mall as soon as school was done to get it. I'd already heard 8/12 from his official site or bootlegs, but I was still blown away by the quality of this CD. The songs are awesome, as expected. My only gripes with it are it's not as complicated of an album as I'm used to from Matt - most of the songs are just straight up rock. I also don't like the country-esque aspects of some songs, like  Empty Road  or  Hopeless , the hidden track that sounds musically like nothing he's ever released. That was disappointing, since he's released two B-sides that completely destroy that track. Nonetheless, White Light Rock & Roll Review is a damn fine album, well worth picking up.   "So another day/pissed away down the bar/Ainâ€™t it a shame/Turned your head off when it could have been/should have been on..."

      With my new incoming supply of currency, I've been on a bit of a gaming binge. Over the past two weeks I've bought three new GBA games to boost my collection. Here's a mini-review for each:   Bomberman  I didn't really intend on buying this game when I went to EB; instead, I was planning on getting Zelda. Unfortunately, that store didn't happen to have any copies of it in stock. Looking back on fond memories of that Wario Blast game I had for my old-school GB, I decided to pick it up. It immediately made me appreciate the style of Wario Blast much more.  Bomberman is far more challenging than I was expecting, especially from an NES game.  Pickups are pretty rare, really, and things move kinda slow. Plus the enemies can throw you for a loop sometimes - they act all stupid and predictable, but then turn around and surprise you now and then when you're stalking them. Then there's the enemies that spawn underneath you if you don't escape a stage before the time runs out. They either pop up beneath you or come up behind you, just so you can see them mowing down on you before you can do anything. It's a good title, though.   Super Mario Brothers  You cannot call yourself any kind of a gamer if you have not played this game. Like many people my age, I spent a good chunk of my early gaming career asorbed in this game, constantly replaying it. When I heard about the Classic NES Series, I knew I had to get this game for nostalgia's sake, and to have it at my fingertips whenever I want. You should know what to expect from this game, really. The only difference you'll note is some slight "smooshing" of the graphics, since it and the other games in the Classic series had to be re-coded to fit on a GBA screen.   Sonic Advance 3  One thing's certain for Sonic fans - no matter what crazy shit Sonic Team adds to the series on the consoles, you can always turn to the Advance series for some new Sonic action, the way it should be. This time around, they implement the "buddy" system from Sonic Heroes, and do it pretty well. There's no switching between characters in the middle of a stage just to get through it. Your partner does what s/he should do - stay the hell out of the way and give a hand when you tell him/her to. The new idea of hubs for the Zones works pretty well too; each Zone has a basic hub area where you can access the 3 acts for that Zone, as well as some mini-games, the boss, and the "Workshop" where you can change your characters, warp to other Zones, or check on the Chaos you've found. Aside from those changes, Sonic veterans know exactly what to expect: Eggman's up to no good, so travel through seven areas and then whoop his super weapon's ass to stop him, but you'll need to beat the Special Stages and collect all 7 Chaos Emeralds to open the "true" final area, where you turn into Super Sonic and destroy the new weapon. With the partner system and some great levels with multiple paths, this formula doesn't feel too stale for once. Plus there's 10 Hidden Chao per stage to find, adding a little bit more replay.  I suppose I should get back to finishing some overdue projects now, since tomorrow's the last day of classes and thus the last day to hand them in...but now I wanna play Wario Blast.

      I've updated my site slightly, just added some news to the main page and some pictures. Several of them are old ones I simply forgot to add, and the others are brand spankin' new, with my short hair...  So, I got an Xbox last month. Here's a quick run-down of each of the games I got for it:   Crimson Skies  - Haven't played it.  Project Gotham Racing 2  - Again, haven't played it.  Dead or Alive 3  - WAY too short with surprisingly few extras, but a fun game. Too bad it's HORRIBLY SHORT!  Halo  - A very smooth FPS. From what I've played so far, it's a damn good game.  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic  - This is the reason why I haven't played CS or PGR2, which came with the bundle I bought. This game is amazing, simply put. The story is perfect for the SW universe, the action is fun, the characters are pretty cool...and the plot twist near the end! I  never  saw it coming. That's a very good thing these days, when plots are straightforward and predictable or nonsensical rubbish. I only wish they'd done more with Upgrading weapons. It's far too simple. And why stop at level 20? Granted, by the time you reach that level you'll probably be in the final "dungeon". Hopefully the sequel will be longer - much longer. My first game took 34 hours (including the several hours I spent at the menu, thinking it might stop the game clock), and in my second game I'm almost finished, and I'm not quite at 20 hours yet.  I've also rented  Ninja Gaiden . It's got a good story with a solid gameplay engine, but the designers must be freakin' amazing at games like this. Since the designer (whose name escapes me) designed the game to be what he would like to play, I'm guessing he can beat the toughest action games with one hand and his eyes taped shut. It'd be nice if they'd included an Easy mode, because this game can become near impossible sometimes. Yesterday I rented  Morrowind , and I just couldn't adapt to the first-person action. It seems like an interesting game (although the characters have been bludgeoned with Ye Olde Fugly Graphics Stick a few times too many, thus identing their faces), but I despise the first-person aspect of it. It takes something away from exploration, especially since the controls for looking up and down are inverted. You can't even change that in the Options menu. Very disappointing. I really  want  to like this game and get into it, but with it's horrible navigation, I just can't.  In two more days, Matthew Good's new CD,  White Light Rock & Roll Review , comes out. I'm incredibly excited. I've heard about 8/12 tracks from the album from live shows, and this seems like the  Underdogs  of his solo career. Pick it up if you like good music.

      Alright, welcome to my blog. I am Chris de Hoog, a 16 year old Canadian, and I shall be using this blog to post my opinions on video games, music, life, and pretty much anything I wish to ramble on about. I'm not going to use it like some online journal, because after all, aren't journals or diaries or whatever supposed to remain secret?  So yeah, enjoy my ramblings, and check out my site: http://hoog.klicart.com.

      As I somewhat promised in my last post, I've rented Sudeki (Xbox) and have a few first impressions. Ahem... - The walking animation for most characters I've seen so far is fucked right up. - The voice acting is...mixed. It's either crappy, or passable. It leans more towards the former. - Decent battle engine (even if it doesn't let you roll forward, but yet you can roll back or to the sides...). - Varying difficulties...At times it's a peice of cake that takes a while to eat, and at other times you have to watch every step you take. I've only really invested an hour or so into it though. I'll have more thoughts sometime.  Finished Legaia 2 yesterday. It was quite a bit shorter than the original, to my disappointment. I beat it in 34 hours, which includes the hours I left it sitting there while I did other things. Those were 34 enjoyable hours, though.  Simply put,  Family Guy  is frickin' amazing. I've been watching the DVDs a lot, and even though I've seen them all, they're all practically as funny as they were when I first saw them.  Well, that's it for now. Just a quickie, today. I'm sure all of you non-existant readers are devastated that it's so short.  " Who will keep me from lashing out?/Anxiety chokes me like a razor wire"

       Yeah yeah,&nbsp; I never did post about Spider-Man 2 after all. It was damn good, much better than the original. It was really well done (as if I ever doubted that it would be). It touches on a lot of concepts they've done in the comics (losing powers, the trouble with him and MJ being together), and leaves a lot of room for the next movie (one of the last scenes is such&nbsp;a HUGE setup that it's almost painful).   While I'm on the subject of Spidey still, Ultimate Spider-Man #62 came out last week, so I picked it up the other day. Again, I'm disappointed with this new Carnage. It's like it doesn't even need a host to be as homicidal as it is in the main timeline of the series. And the way it offs its victims is kinda messed...So it impales them, shows them some face, sucks the life out of them, and leaves some creepy withered corpse? That's alright, I guess, but it's a crappy way to do in in the character that dies in this issue. I won't say anymore than that...but the next few issues better be DAMN good.   One more Spidey point, and I'm done, I promise. Electonics Boutique has a pretty sweet promotion where you can trade in (almost) any 3 games for&nbsp;PS2, GameCube, or Xbox, and get the new game. I parted with Kingdom Hearts (PS2), Resident Evil (GCN), and Crimson Skies (XBOX). Just be sure to bring a couple extra games if the ones you have are greatest hits, because they can't take games they have too many copies of already. I learned that the hard way.    &nbsp;  Okay, enough of that.   I recently bought Volume 1 of Family Guy, Volume 1 of Futurama, and Season 1 of Chappelle's Show, and all three are great purchases. I think everyone knows just how great Family Guy is - if you don't, you're deprived, and if you don't like it, you're uptight and lying to yourself - so I don't need to point out that it's worth the money. Futurama's a decent show, but the Family Guy one was 2-for-1, and they didnt have the second volume of it, so I picked this, since it was the best of the titles that were part of the deal. I haven't watched it yet, but I've seen the episodes on it on Teletoon recently. Chappelle's Show is a steal - I paid $22 CDN for it, and it's 2 DVDs of hilarious jokes on stereotypes, sex, and pop culture. If you don't mind racial slurs and "strong language", you should definitely check it out. If you do mind those things, lighten up...    &nbsp;  Speaking of steals, I've also purchased Legaia 2: Dual Saga for $16 brand new. I'm a huge fan of the original (it's my favourite game after certain Final Fantasies), and this game hasn't let me down too much. I'm pretty far into it, and I've found no connections to the first game other than certain monsters, songs, and the basic battle system. That's fine, it's how the FF games work, but I was expecting something more related to the first. The Origin system sucks though, compared to the Ra-Seru of the first game. I loved how they would grow up the characters arms throughout the game, and asorb certain enemies as magic. Now there's basically just a summon monster for every character but one (making him pretty much useless) that has attacks that are all very similar, and can be used to interact with certain objects in dungeons. It makes up for that with the Camping aspect - you can now actually camp, which allows you to chat with the characters, combine items, or cook food, all things that enhance the experience.   I'd still say the original was better, though. The story and characters were better, as was the battle system. It's just little things that I miss, like how the characters' appearance would change when they equipped new armor. Their weapons change, and even appear differently in story sequences (unlike most RPGs...). But damn, this is an overrated masterpeice just like it's predecessor.    &nbsp;  Lastly, onto Tales of Symphonia. It's a pretty good RPG, from what I've played. It kinda reminds me of Star Ocean: The Second Story. I wish I had more time to put into it. It's definitely worth at least a rental, GameCube owners.    &nbsp;  Well, that's it for all...Hopefully I'll have some views on Sudeki soon if I can get my hands on it this week.

      I assume everyone who isn't blind and deaf knows that the new Spiderman movie is out now. I'm going to see it later on tonight, so I'll post my opinions and stuff tomorrow. Like any good fan, I'm hyped. I rented the game yesterday for Xbox, and have spent most of my time outside of summer school and sleep playing it. It's definitely a huge improvement from the last one, and the PSone games. The control system is even better now, making web-slinging across town an interesting task. Although, like all games, it's not perfect. After a while, it gets pretty fucking repetitive. Around Chapter 10, the goals for continuing get pretty repetitive: "Go to ________, and get x Hero Points." To get Hero Points, you've got to do superhero duties and stop random crimes - such as purse snatchings, car jackings, shootouts, or even stoping a road rage-ing driver or retrieving a kid's balloon. While it's enjoyable, it gets repetitive as hell to do all these kinds of tasks over and over and over (most only weild about 150-350 Hero Points, and you need 2000, 3000, or 4000 to complete the Chapter. Plus, the Xbox version has some bad glitches. There's some drawing problems, which are forgivable. But, I've found the game hangs often enough to become an inconvienience. For example, the first time I had to go to the Daily Bugle, the game hung at the "Loading..." screen, forcing me to restart my console and start over from the point half an hour ago where I was told to save. I consider myself a pretty freakin' good gamer, so I don't save much unless I can feel a boss fight coming, if I have to stop playing, or if I know my TV is going to fuck up again like it has been lately. I've found such glitches to be so rare recently that I don't even worry anymore. On another trip to the Bugle, I kinda appeared inside the Bugle, only Peter wasn't visible, and I couldn't get to where I needed to go. I promptly ran back to the entrance, and the game continued as if it hadn't screwed up - the cinema that should have played when I came in played then instead. I had a similar problem when I was chasing a certain character - I caught up to that person, and that person just kinda stood there, instead of running off as that person was supposed to. Despite the glitches and the oh-so-tiring tasks, and the circle-beating enemies, it's a damn fine game. The GTA-esque system really suits the franchise.  Now, onto the medium of Spidey's origins: comics. I used to read comics a lot as a kid - mostly Sonic the Hedgehog and Spidey. Then I just kinda stopped - I got tired of the stories and such. But over the past couple years, I've dished out the cash for some when I've had it. Somewhere along the line, comics have become less substantial. They're shorter and more expensive, and still have plenty of ads. I thought comics were becoming "cool" again, thanks to the popularity of movies like Spiderman and X-Men; correct me if I'm wrong, but shouldn't that mean comic publishers should be doing more to please their broadening audiences? Having heard that Carnage, my favourite Spidey villain, was going to be in the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I got my ass over to my local comic store as soon as possible (today) and picked up both of the issues that were on the shelves so far. Ultimate Spidey is an awesome series. The staff responsible have done a great job of updating the story to fit this time period better, and the art is AWESOME. But damnit, I wish they would stop advertising falsely. What happened to the scenes on the covers of comics actually being a part of the comics? I picked up issues 60 and 61, one featuring Carnage's new form and the other showing Spidey trapped in a stranglehold by his tendrils. But yet, inside, there wasn't even talk of him - just a very long setup. You don't actually see Carnage until the end of 61 - and its just an early version of the symbiote. This is a 5-issue story arc for one of Spidey's most violent and dangerous foes, and he hasn't even been created in the first 2 issues. Meaning the "origin" part probably won't be over with until the conclusion of the 3rd issue, leaving only 2 issues for the fight itself. While it's not gonna make me stop reading the series, it does leave me pissed off. Comics used to at least seem so much longer...A lot more happened in each issue, and I don't think they're any shorter these days. Maybe it's just this series... Anyways, I also picked up issues 71, 72, and 73 of Witchblade (yeah, I'm a little behind...I'm catching up), and they kinda restored my faith in the medium. This Death Pool storyline is pretty interesting - they've managed to combine a lot of story with a good dose of action, and of course, plenty of seductive drawings of Sara. I can't wait to see how this storyline turns/turned out.  Anyways, onto site business...I'm working on a section for the Damien Eikharn story, chock full of background info. Expect it up in a few days.

      Summer school's done and dead, so I now have an abundance of extra hours in the day to slack off. I'm going insane, but it sure as fuck beats going to school or work.  I finally caved into the advice of many of my friends and downloaded  Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town . I never saw the attraction to it that so many people had, but I figured what the hell. I've got nothing better to do. And now I'm hooked on it. Damn game developers, sneaking crack into their game's code... Picked up  Legend of Legaia  for $20 pre-owned, and proceeded to giggle like a happy schoolgirl.  I did something the other day that I usually don't do - I bought CDs. I don't often go out and buy a CD unless it's reasonably priced, but with some CDs reaching 17.99 or even 18.99, I just lose interest in buying them. It's really getting rediculous, especially when older CDs are  26.99 !!! I fucking refuse to spend that much unless it's a really rare album, which old-school AFI really isn't. So yeah, I got the Beastie Boys'  To the 5 Boroughs , and Jet's  Get Born .  Boroughs  is a damn solid album - it's got a good mix of their usual goofiness, and the more serious political songs. I don't like much rap, if any, but the Beasties are a group I make an exception for. Jet kinda surprised, I expected more straight rock like the songs you hear on the radio, such as "Cold Hard Bitch" and "Rollover DJ", but I was somewhat wrong - there's some pretty good quiet, slow songs on there, and even more mindless rock. Usually I wouldn't really enjoy plain, basic, simple rock like this, but I dunno, they do it well.   CoDE  is reaching 130 pages, but of course, that's double-spaced on Five-Star notebook paper, so I get the feeling it won't equal much once I finish this draft and get it typed up in Word. I'm getting to the good part now where everything starts falling together, so I'm plugging in a page or two every day. At this rate, it should be done...late next year, if these trends continue. Heh heh... I've also got some ideas for a modern fantasy short story, set in a version of our own world where guns never became commonly used weapons. If I can get the motivation to sit down and start typing it up, I might have it up on the site soon.  Well, that's all for now. I'm off to curse my sunburn some more, and get back to Harvest Moon. I got a kid coming soon, ya know.  " Oh mai oui/You can catch me/At Jean Vie with a pastry/C'est ci c'est la, oh n'est pas/Qu'est-ce-que c'est le brouhahaha? "
