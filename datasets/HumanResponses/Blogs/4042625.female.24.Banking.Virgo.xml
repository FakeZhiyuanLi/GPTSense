      Every Friday afternoon the second and third floors of my office play lucky buck. You throw a buck with your name on it in a box and hopefully you will win... I have played for 3 years and have never won that is 156 dollars wasted. But today I put my buck in the box with the hope of a 5 year old at christmas... Maybe this friday will be THE Friday.

      Where a work a woman just lost her 12 year old... Her brain exploded and she was in a coma for a week... They had to pull the plug... she was 12 and she suffered alone in her bedroom.  The woman who sits in front of me sister in law has liver cancer and is in the hospital right now post-op after having the cancer removed. She will wait a year or more for a transplant. The Dr dosen't think she will make it that long.  Delita just this minute found out that her mother died the whole floor went silent as she cried.   I just can't understand all this shit...

      I wish I had a special power. I don't want to turn people into a pillar of salt or control the weather. Death and mayhem are not the purpose of having a special power. I have given this more thought then it deserves and I have decided that i would like to have the power to give people rashes. Thats right rashes... A nice butt rash in the middle of a 2 hour meeting or a boob rash on a date.

      To vote or not to vote… I have no interest in politics. My self imposed political mantra is “ignorance is bliss”  I hate an election year. It is a long drawn out high school popularity contest and at the end ½ of the country is going to spend the next 4 years trying to ruin the winner.  But something has drawn my attention to this election. Maybe is 9/11, or the fact that the country has been lied to on such a grand scale or maybe I am just bored and need something to rant about.  I wish I would have paid more attention to how our political system works, maybe then I wouldn’t feel so stupid about the subject. But this is how I feel about it  For the last three months I have trying to decide if I am going to vote in this Presidential Election.  I have seen P. Ditty with his vote or die t-shirt, watched Ben on the O’Riley Factor, I suffered thru the Democratic convention and I will suffer thru the republican one.  MTV has tried to rock my vote, they have forced the idea that my vote matters down my throat and they have failed. I am a New Yorker, in general NY an easy target for Democratic Electoral College votes. MY VOTE DOES NOT MATTER.  And if my vote did matter I don’t like the choices any way.    One side you have the over privileged snot nosed ass, with a desire to own the world not rule it. A man who’s stupidity is exemplified by his belief in his religion. A deer in the head lights in time of need and a bull in a china shop in times of unnecessary action.  One the other side you have a man who has never really made a decision about anything, he has made a career of playing both sides against the middle. He has used his service to this country to blind us with his metals and if we give him enough time we will all hate him as much as we hate Bush.  God I miss the days when our president was just getting head in office.

      Today in NY is it overcast, dull, cool and rainy. I love this kind of weather. I think the sun is way to depressing because its so god damned cheerful. It's not like I get to enjoy the sunny weather since I am stuck in a grey 6 foot by 6 foot cell...I mean cubicle all day.
