       Wow, only uno more day at school, which is double geography (don't do anything anyway), double english (don't do anything anway), french (I personally don't do anything anyway), RE (don't do anything anyway) and games (meh...softball).   So not really a day at all! Yay!    &nbsp;  Intresting incident walking to the stop de bus avec le Sharon - I swung my PE kit at her head. Now if she was normal, it would've flown over her head, and she would've just been scared of being hit in the head. Whereas Sharon, not being normal, held her phone in the way. So it pinged into the road! Ah-hah. Well, it was really funny at the time. Then&nbsp;I bought a lighter, and I made the flame big(ish), only it wouldn't go out, and scared my thumb.    &nbsp;  Then saw Will. Exploded the lighter. Saw the retards that work in Budgens. Hehe. It's the law - only retards are allowed to work in Budgens.    &nbsp;  Downloaded  Loverman  again, I lost my original copy of  Garage Inc 2 . Very amusing lyrics - well...odd anyhoo.  urlLink http://www.lyricsondemand.com/m/metallicalyrics/lovermanlyrics.html# &nbsp;there...amuse yourself.

       Well, apparently, I'm back.    &nbsp;  Went to see Grandad in hostpital, he's in the same bit of the same hospital as mum was (cancer wards at Mount Vernon). He seems alright. Yay!    &nbsp;  Went to M&amp;S to get some shopping for Nan. Jenny got 2 hair product things (mousse + spray&nbsp;I believe), so I was allocated £2 by Paul. Now in possession of 2.25 litres of  Blackthorn . Definately got the better deal there, methinks. :D   After, visiting grandad, went to  Wagamama's . Good shit. Noodles and suchlike. Nummyness.

       Well, I thought if Lloyd can do it, so can I.    &nbsp;  Haha. Good gutiarist though.    &nbsp;  I wouldn't get too excited about this...chances are I'll have given up on this by the end of the week. Well, a week is enough to discover the excitmentness of my life.    &nbsp;  So...it's 11:16, I'm listening to  Ace of Spades  by  Motörhead . I also just learnt the bass to  Are you gonna be my girl?  by  Jet . I've made an executive desicion, and I like them. A bit.
