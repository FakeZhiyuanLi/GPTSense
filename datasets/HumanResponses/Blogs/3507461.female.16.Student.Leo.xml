      Today was a good day! Well pretty good.. it was so boring- we did nothing but talk in all of our classes, they should really start our finals on Monday.  OH WELL!! So I studied a lot for physical science, and Mike suprised me and came over for like 45 minutes and we got ice cream.  And he dropped me off and went to work.  Since then, I've been sitting @ home BORED OUT OF MY MIND because it's so nice out and I don't have a fucking car to go anywhere because I don't have my fucking license, which REALLY makes me mad!  The Cubs lost yesterday's game, it was a good game, but we just couldn't pull through! I really want to go shopping, but I don't think that I'm going.  :-/ oh well, maybe some other time.  3 more days that I have to wake up for school.. which means 3 more days until SUMMERRR! WOO FINALLY! lol and my birthday is like a month n 1/2 awayyy :) well i'm gunna go try to find something to do to keep myself occupied with.. Byeeeeeee

      Yesterday - Wooo and the Cubs finally win! Thank the lord!! There's another game today.. hopefully they will win!  Oh well.. other than that.. yesterday Me, Nicole and Rob went to Nick's baseball game, and they won too.  Then I came home and got ready and then went to Rob's game with Nicole and Lauren.  They won also!  It was kinda hard to find the place, but with the directions of my good mommy.. we were able to get there.  After Rob's game we got something to eat from Subway with Missi Amanda Ashley and Josh.  Then, we came back to my house so we could figure out something to do so we weren't driving around.  Jaclyn said that we could come over so we went there and then a bunch of people came.  Nick, Alex, Ryan, PJ, Alex, James... and a bunch more people! Then we stayed there and Nicole took me and Lauren home.  That was the end of that night?  Today - I'm going to the mall w/ Nicole and Ashley.  Then coming home to CLEAN- wonderful... hopefully I can lay outttt ughh!  Maybe I'll see Mike today- probably not b/c his brother is graduating @ like 6 so nevermind that.  LOL This is donee  Byeeee

      Nicole got her license yesterday! I'm very proud of her and new that she could do it!! So she picked me up yesterday after she got it and we drove around.. and then went to Missi's house and she called Missi and she was like "Missi, I got into a fight w/ my parents so I walked over here.." and she came RUNNING out b/c she knew that Nicole got her license! Omgg lol It's so cool! And when she came to pick me up.. my mom took a pic of us in the car! :)  Then we went to Ben's game for a little and Frank pitched- he did very good! And then 2 other kids pitched, then we left and Missi dropped me and Nicole off @ her house b/c we wanted to run to CVS to get nail polish so we did and then got gas and it was so much fun! Then i came home...  Today I had school (ahh 2 more fucking days of this bullshit... review review review).. anyways- so i went to school then to work (soo slow today) and then Mike came over... wow today was like a perfect day between us! It was really nice- we got along really good and there was a lot of joking around :) which i love! And then we went to missi's and then when we came back 2 my house we like blasted Aerosmith- Angel, which is like our song that we always lay too and we had a REALLY nice kissss blahhh hahah byee! i'm getting too detailed!  :) 2 more full school days left..  1 month and 3 weeks and 1 day till my birthday :-/  Byeeeee

      That's how I feel right now.  INSANEE!!! Well I went to work and it was crazy- it was soo busy, I don't think that anyone really got a break.  :-/ if I wasn't at school I would have came to help them out.  BUT I WAS AT SCHOOL.  Speaking of school there are only 7 more days that i have to wait up.    7   woo haha thank the LORD.  Dr. Bachi worked today- whatta fun guy lol he's soo cute.  Hm.. I think that's all, I'm gunna post some quotes just cuz i'm bored.  "Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime, warm my heart with talk of summertime. Say you'll need me both for now and always, anywhere you go let me go too, love me, that's all I ask of you."  "So this is what I'm going to do: I'm going to hug you. And I'm not going to let go for a really long time. And I'm going to tell you that I love you. Which is actually a pretty good deal. Because it means I'll do anything on the off chance it'll make you a little less sad" --Dawson's Creek  Life is like a pillow...it starts out fluffy and then gradually gets all beat up its not comfortable anymore...it can be refluffed to a point...but there are times when u just need a new pillow....and someone special to share it with :)  I still believe one day you I will find ourselves in love again   *A true friend is a person who is there for you through thick  and thin. They don't judge you by the clothes you wear, or the  size of your house. They love you no matter what. They are a  shoulder to cry on, or a partner to laugh with. They stand by  you in your times of need, and listen when you are excited.  They know every little thing about you. They stand up for you  when others don't.*  *Well it was a million tiny, little things that when you added them all up, they meant we were supposed to be together . . . and I knew it. I knew it the very first time I touched her. It was like coming home . . . the only real home I'd ever known. I was just taking her hand to help her out of a car. It was like . . . magic.* ~ Sleepless In Seattle   That's all 4 now.. i'll probably post more later! :) Bye

      I just got home from Mike's house and it was a lot of fun.  He picked me up around 3:30 and brought me back to his house and when I first got there he was being obnoxious, haha JK but then ordered a pizza, and ate, then went outside and played soccer.  He tried to get the ball past me but i'm just too good of a goalie!  Haha then we came back inside and played 3 games of pool and i won 2 and then we were too tired to play the 3rd so we just went upstairs and he fell asleep and then I cleaned his room!  Awww aren't I so nice! :) haha well yeah that was pretty much the best part of my dayyy.  I'll write more later.  Cubs better win.  Byeee!
