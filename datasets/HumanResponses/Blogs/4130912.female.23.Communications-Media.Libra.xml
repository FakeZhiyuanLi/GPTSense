      Every woman can see herself as a princess. I used to visualize myself as a princess from waking age till I was 18. Now as an adult, I realize how much of that princess I want to be. I don't want to be waited on all the time or be snotty. I do not have expensive taste (believe me, I LOVE Sonic and Long John Silver's way too much), I dont have to wear a ball gown everyday, I would love to wear my jeans and tops everyday, and I do not have to have over a million dollars in jewelery, make-up, clothes, shoes(and I am a shoe person), and whatever other accesories in life all the royal and extremely rich woman have. I want to feel like a princess, I want to know that I am beautiful and others to make me fel good by once in a while saying, "You know, you look good today Heather!" That would make my day because I would feel like I was beautiful and I would know that people are not saying this compliment just to cheer me up. I have a lot of blogs and wedding dieting and the challenges brides, bridesmaids, grooms, groomsmen, parents of the bride, and parents of the groom face, but that day that these two people get married will be remembered forever. So, you always want to be remembered as one of the people with the natural glow of happiness. I know Dezi is going to be beaming, glowing, smiling from ear to ear, and yes she will be a tad nervous, but that is totally because she and I are not the most graceful people on this earth, so you can figure that one out. She will be a princess for the day and absolutely beautiful, I will be her right hand woman so I gotta keep up. She is going to take a breath away or two and her bridesmaids are going to be right there just smiling big. So, I know I will be as pretty as I can force myself to be. So see you guys there.

      One of my favorite movies was "What Women Want" with Mel Gibson. I really believe a lot of men need to see this movie. It shows a lot of women go thru to be beautiful. Women do mostly the painful miserable stuff for themselves, but we usaully try to look our best for the men, whether it is a date, husband, fiancee, best guy friend, brother, father, or male boss. Women want a man that does not add extra stress to their lives. Women do not want a man that is very needy. As you can tell I have dealt with pain before. Women want men that will help them do anytihng. I would love a guy that understood all the things women go thru to be considered smart, beautiful, sexy, sweet, and beautiful. I know men don't have it the easiest, but women have some serious trying moments. I know at work I struggle big time because I am new in the computer industry, and it will be a struggle, however I will overcome. Men have to be pretty tough to deal with women, at least that is what I believe. Men also have to do women during time of months, not getting a promotion, having family trouble. and any other problems that end up in tears. I think that a man that loves a woman when she is her ugliest. We are talking mud mask wearing, bad hair day, and all other ugly moments. I want a man that will love that side of me. For all the million types of men out there all of them have a potential mate out there. So, to all of those that have a significant other, you keep doing your thing. Those of you that do not, keep looking, you will find it.

      There are so many little things in life, that are the best. I especially love people that smile, the ones with a great smile are the best. They have that smile you will never forget. That is so awesome. The people that will do anything that make you laugh. The people that will not be sad for long. There are the people that support you in whatever you say and do, as long you are not being harmed. There are people on this earth that you love with the biggest part of your heart, and you thought you didn't like that person when you 1st met them. Then you find out that you care about what happens to this person and all you wish for is their happiness. I used to believe that you were not supposed to end up with your best friend, I have completely changed my tune. I have best guy friend, who I would do anything for. We don't have a future together, but we have the best everything together. We have the best time, memories, and most importantly laughs together. I want nothing, but the best for him. I want him to suceed in whatever he wants out of his life. I want him to be eternally happy.  He has set an example in my life for I should want and I deserve out of life. He makes me feel like I can do anything and still be me. I believe this is the coolest thing in the world. I believe in waiting for that person that God wants me to be with. I know when the time is right, God will show me the way. Until then, I am finally learning how to be happy and I have the greatest people to make me happy. I have a friend that will let me cry on his shoulder, fall on my butt, laugh with, be mad at, be mad with, and the greatest part is I spend everyday with him. Yes, he laughs when I fall on my butt, but he helps me up and makes me laugh about it.  So, when I am blue all I have to think about is how someone is probably laughing. The guys I will date in the future must understand that my best guy friend is very important to me. They will also have to have some of his qualities and much more. This inspiration came to me from Dezi. We were talking one day, and I was talking about my speech, that I will give at the reception about her. I was talking about the speech the bride gives and we mentioned every bride thanks her husband for being her best friend. This is the whole and complete truth. All couples need to be friends 1st. In so many cases, like my own the best part is the friendship, I wouldn't trade my friends for the world. Their are essential to life. I want to thank Dezi for evrything she does, says, and gives to me, you are a complete angel. I want James to know, thank you so much, you make me want to stay sane.  Amanda, Michelle, &amp; Stephanie, God Bless you! Well, David, I wan to thank you for being Dezi's best friend on every level, you make her smile the biggest. I promise you guys I am not trying to be so sappy, but there are those moments when you gotta. Everybody have a great Friday and a wonderful weekend.

      Well, where do I start? To be a maid of honor you must be all of the following things: Calm, cool, collected, graceful, a great friend, a shoulder to cry on, opinionated (to a point), beautiful, organized, smile all the time, look great in a lot of different colors (all depending on the brides mood), and not be anyway nervous at all. Ok, I am calm most of the time, I am cool because I know Rizzi, actually I am cool because of who my friends are and the fact they want to hang with me, collected, well not really, graceful never, I am going to roll down to the aisle to my spot,  I consider myself a great friend, I am a shoulder to cry on, I am very opinionated (yes, to a point), I am working on the beautiful thing (what a challenge that is), organized (not so much, no), I can smile through anything, I am color challenged, I will be a tad nervous for myself not falling, but I will be very nervous for David and extremely nervous for Dezi. However, the day will be awesome and totally the best day of their lives and inspirational to other people. Well, for those of you trying to look good for the wedding, YOU GO! I am right there with you.  For those of you trying to get some poise and grace in your life, me too. You can ask my co-worker, he laughs at me everyday from all the tripping, falling, hurting myself, and the other very clutzy moments I have. My organizational skills are being worked on. Believe me, I work in an office now, I have no choice.  Well, everybody have a great day at work, school, or wherever else you go in your day. I will be on the positive side tomorrow too.

      I am telling you, dieting stinks so badly. I started the Wedding Dress Diet today. That is what is called. No, I am not getting in a wedding dress, but I really like the exercises that are involved in this diet. I also can actually make the food that they recommend that you make. The results are guaranteed to start showing in three weeks. I don't know about that part, but I am trying a healthier lifestyle. I want to be absolutely the sexiest person, no I am so joking. Although, that would not be a bad feeling. I have been big for so long that I wouldn't know what to do if I lost all my weight. I really am envisioning myself in a smaller size. It is starting to take effect in my head. I truly believe that I need to really start thinking about what I eat and how I live my life. I really am more health conscious since my mom passed away. I really want to be healthy. I have been slowly replacing my unhealthy snacks with Special K bars and low-fat snacks. I am really working on not thinking about food. I am thinking how incredibly good looking I am going to look in my dream size. I am really looking forward to what I will look like in my maid of honor outfit. Of course, I won't be as beautiful as the bride. However, remember  she's the bride.  That is the saying I taught her. Well, everybody have a great evening and a great day tomorrow.

      You know women have their wedding roughly planned by the age of 18. How long have they been planning their wedding? Most women start planning their wedding at age 5. That sounds a little weird, but it is the truth, I was one of those women. I was 4 years old watching the movie Cinderella thinking, that is going to be me. I am going to marry prince charming and live right next door to my best friend and my parents are going to live across the street, my sister and her husband will live next to them. Oh, we all live in castles mind you. I was so set on that idea for years, even in middle school I would tell my friends that I was going to marry a prince and live in a castle, by then I didn't want my parents across the street, nor my sister, and I also had a brother added to the picture. I really didn't want him living near me. Well, as high school came around I knew that the castle was not affordable unless I married a rich prince. Then I realized all boys do not make good men. I also realized Cinderella was most likely a size 2 and that she was also a myth. I was a size 26, never had a boyfriend, and was being picked on by the future men in this world. So, I then established that marriage was an awful thing that only cost a lot of money. There was a high divorce rate my senior year and a lot of had to get married situations came up. So, I was scared on the whole idea of marriage. Then I entered college, I would see happy people all the time. I want to mention that Dezi was my best friend thru my high school years. I started to see a lot of people hooking up. I never dated, but all my friends were. The thing is they were in these relationships that weren't going anywhere. When you turn 20 and 21 it is all about having fun. When you turn 22 you think maybe I should try to be serious. Then when you turn 23-24 you say to yourself, "I need to be serious, what do I want out of life. Do I honestly want to be at bars, clubs, and other weird hangouts to find that one person?" You start looking for people at church, school, work, or around your family events. When Dez said she met David, I thought that this could go somewhere. When they were dating, I prayed that find happiness with him. Just the way she talked about him I knew he was something special. When they were talking about rings I cried, my prayers were answered my best friend is happy. After they got engaged and when she and I started looking at dresses. I knew she was getting married, but it hadn't hit me yet. I realize now, after the bridal shows, the trying on dresses, and the church location, she'd really getting married. WOW! She won't be Dezi Muse anymore! I couldn't be happier for her. I am so completely excited, the doubts I have had about my future are slowly going away. Everybody deserves happiness and most people get it. I am glad that David and Dezi have it. I know it will come to those who wait. Congratulations David and Dezi, you deserve it!

      Well, the way I talk to people when I talk about being the maid of honor for Dezi, they think this woman has no a.) No Life b.) Too Much Time on Her Hands or c.) No Job. The answer is actually none of the above. My life is to take care of my family, go to school, work, attend all my brothers games, and somehow hang with my friends. So no there is not enough time for me to do anything. Well, I was unemployed when Dezi asked me to be her maid of honor, but now I have a job and when I finish my training session of the day, I look up wedding stuff and ideas that I can e-mail or talk to the bride about.  Weddings are the coolest, I believe every woman should try to plan with, be part of, or even get involved in a wedding. I think that everyone knows the saying, "A wedding is for the bride and her mother!" Yes this so true, but it is great when people ask your opinion about something very important in their life. I am so incredibly excited about being a part of something so cool with Desiree. We have been best friends since I was a freshman in high school and she was a senior.  That was 9 years ago. Oh my we are getting old.  Well, after all that we been through, being others maid or matron of honor, is pretty cool. Just remember a great saying from the show "Will &amp; Grace" Grace says, "I'm the Bride!!" She is telling her best friend Will this and he is mad at her, because she got married without him there. As she is trying to break his arm her new husband runs up to her and grabs her and says, "Don't hurt him, I still need him for the 20% of you I can't handle!" That will be me, I will be just like Grace. My friends are the only ones that can handle me entirely. The put up with a lot from me. So yes even whoever I end up with will not be able to deal with me completely. Well, I gotta go to work. Have fun today people.

      I have never been a maid of honor before,  OH MY GOD ! It is the coolest. It is especially fun trying to stick your best friend in a dress that wears her. However, I know for a fact that whatever she chooses she will look amazing in her dress. Because you know why? SHE'S THE BRIDE! I have been told by another friend that I will be her maid of honor whenever she gets married how cool is that?  I am loved. I am very happy for David & Dezi! They are the cutest, sweetest, and goofiest couple in the world and I hope they stay that way forever!
