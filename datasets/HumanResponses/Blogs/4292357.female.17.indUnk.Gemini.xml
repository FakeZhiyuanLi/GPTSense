        Woke up at 7 today and went to the prosecution building in Al-Qurum. A lady showed me all the different departments over there, damn what they’re doin is so kewl!! She showed me some files with all the information about a case. At 8.45am we went to the court AHHH I was there at last, but it wasn’t what I have been picturing. I thought it was as big as the ones on the movies instead it was small with all those wood works. I attended 25 cases is 3 hours and a half although I was fasting I didn’t get tired I had fun… really!! I was there sitting on the front raw with all the lawyers listening to the cases carefully. One of the cases is about a guy who got drunk and broke his house windows and once he got in the house he started hitting his father with a long bar of metal!! The father told the judge to have no mercy on his son… that was unbelievable and funny at the same time hehe. I really had fun I have decided to study law… ok hope I don’t change my mind coz I really liked it, working with crimes n all!
