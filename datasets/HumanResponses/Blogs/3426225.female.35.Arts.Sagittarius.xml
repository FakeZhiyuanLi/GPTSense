      Here's another warning: this one is to the restaurant owners in the South Jersey area who think it's cool to charge $20 for an entree of shrimp (which included  THREE  f'in' shrimp), AND to run out of baked potatoes, AND to serve a salad made entirely from old lettuce, AND to do so while NBC's unappetizing maggot-fest Fear Factor is on in the bar, and viewable to every single customer. J&nbsp;E&nbsp;S&nbsp;U&nbsp;S &nbsp;&nbsp;  C&nbsp;H&nbsp;R&nbsp;I&nbsp;S&nbsp;T&nbsp;.  First of all:  screw you . I'm in a bad mood today, and I'm NEVER in a bad mood. I'm partially blaming you for my state of mind today.  Second of all, it is absolutely NOT cool to do what you did last night.   It is especially not cool because I asked the waitress in a friendly, non-confrontational manner to see if she could get the barmaid to change the channel, so we could eat our mediocre meals without hearing people wretch up maggots. The barmaid not only did NOT turn off Fear Factor, she had the nerve to say "the maggot-eating part is over."  Oh, and thirdly: your rolls weren't exactly stale, but they sure weren't fresh, either. The roll experience was not helped at all by your very, VERY cold butter.  My warning: stay tuned for reviews of area restaurants on my web page. I'll be naming names. I should have a few reviews of different establishments (including the one mentioned above) by the end of the week. You'll be able to read them at  urlLink www.ottseetotsee.com/etc.html

      Was reading Patricia's blog about how the humidity was causing her to perspire, and I started to think about underarm protection in general.  It is very thoughtful of those HBA companies to put dual agents into one convenient item (deodorant AND antiperspirant). However, I find that none of them are effective for me, unless I shower with a deodorant soap first. Those girlie soaps are much better for my skin and my mood, but apparently, they ain't doing the job on my pits.  Sigh.  Am thinking about just being okay with my smell and sweat (it's not like I'm not clean, you know?) and just wanted to warn you all.

      I'm not sure I'll ever really have anything to say here.

      My father gave me his old Mac 8100 recently, a computer, he claims, that gave him nothing but hardship in the short time he owned it. Because we're trying to clean the place up, we decided we should pass it on to someone else. But before doing so, we opened it up, to see what was in it. Glen discovered that it had a 10 gigabyte hard drive, which is:  a) reasonably small by today's standards, but still nothing to laugh at b) obviously an upgrade for the 8100  So we took it out and put it in the empty bay in Glen's G3.  Unfortunately, the hard drive is physically too large for the G3 case, but Glen decided to keep it anyway. He just ditched the top case and took an old cutting board and placed it on top of the open-faced CPU.  We booted the G3, and found out what my dad had named the hard drive, that he claimed gave him nothing but grief:  Dick Head  Two words, upper and lower case. Maybe like a first and a last name, I'm not sure.  Glen decided to let the name stay. And he's had no trouble with it at all.

      I was planning to start writing restaurant reviews on my website, inspired in part, by a particularly distressing (and expensive) meal a few weeks ago.  But before I kicked things off with a negative review, I decided to give the offending restaurant a chance to redeem itself. I mailed them a complaint letter. Two weeks ago. Honestly, I don't know if I'm being fair, but doesn't two weeks seem like plenty of time to send a response? Especially for a relatively small, local restaurant?  Well, I haven't gotten a response. In the meantime, Weird NJ magazine approached me to write an article on the bars and other establishments in this area, and well, I decided to mention the foul experience at that particular restaurant. I'm not sure if that will have any impact on the restaurant at all, but it makes me smile to think about all of those other people from New Jersey reading it...  It's the Caribbean Crab, on the White Horse Pike in Oaklyn, by the way.

      I have three furry mammals as pets; and they are shedding like mad because of the heat.  It's difficult to keep up with all the hair.  And it makes me wonder how many hairs I wind up eating in my meals each day.

      We live in Merchantville. Not out of desire, and we stay only until we can find a good deal on a house. The landlord is probably the worst human being I have ever met in my life, and the neighbors surrounding us are loud and inconsiderate. Makes me wonder if this is how all of Merchantville is, or if we just happen to live on a very special corner.  Neither of us is from this part of the state, and we've just begun our research. The Salem area popped up with some interesting houses, and not knowing better, we decide to investigate.  I should note that we live a mere five minutes from Camden, one of the scariest armpits on the entire east coast, and Camden is paradise compared to Salem. Yes, there were some beautiful homes in Salem, and for great prices. And here's why: the streets look the way I envision the streets look in the Palestian territories that the Israelis have bulldozed: gone; dirt; rubble.  It seems like it's a quiet suburban town got a bit of ghetto, and it took hold and hasn't let go. What are the city officials doing about that? How did they let the infrastructure go so far downhill? Why are the streets gone? I think we drove down Thompson Street - or the path that used to be Thompson Street, anyway, and there was such blight: bombed out homes, wrecked cars, kids screaming in the streets, cats with no fur and distended bellies wandering purposelessly; and these image have burned themselves into my brain and I can't shake them.  People in New Jersey talk about Camden, Newark, Jersey City, Asbury, Trenton as being hell-holes, and they're right. I grew up near Asbury Park, lived in Trenton for a number of years, am currently living outside of Camden, and everyone in New Jersey has been to Jersey City and Newark. I have never seen anything like Salem. How did that happen? How did it get that way? And why doesn't anyone talk about it?
