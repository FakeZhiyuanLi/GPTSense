        Okay....so I've realized that I just miss Andrew like crazy!     I miss seeing him, talking to him, being around him...     I just get to thinking about him working so much and it sucks, no doubt about that!  And he does need to concentrate on his work, but concentrating on me once in a while isn't too hard...so I think at least!  A simple email would have done! I just realized, that when I was talking to a co-worker last night, I realize how much I miss him...how much I just want to see him...how well he treats me...how much he does love  me...     I guess a week of nothing can make a girl question. And i know I shouldn't question, but just the fact that this is how my last relationship ended, it scares me, really scares me!     I just wrote him an email of how i feel about him and what he means to me!  Maybe I'm an idiot for doing that...but I can't help how I feel about him!  He is everything to me!     Some of you who know what is going on and maybe have read my past posts are gonna shoot me in the head, but I can't help how I feel....     Anyway, I'm off for the night...I will write more tomorrow!     night y'all!

        So its Saturday and I am finally calling this my first day off this week because I ended up working a midnight last night!  The things I do for friends!!  Or, I'm just insane!!  either or it doesn't matter...I had to work last night!  So today I got up at like 2pm and I promised my mom and the rest of my family that I would scrape the paint off in the bathroom and clean it well because the tiling guy is coming within the week!  So while I did that, my mom ripped off the wallpaper in our front foyer, and my brother finished insulating the basement!!  Our house looks like a tornado hit it 5 times over...its a hell hole!  But I just keep thinking how good its going to look when everything is done!!  I can't wait to see it!!  But now I'm sitting here covered in paint chips waiting to hit the shower cuz I stink!!  LOL!          I was invited out tonight to go to the Junction, but I don't know if I'm up to it...I'm exhausted and I'm thinking I may just chill out here tonight and read some of my book!  Maybe I will go catch a movie with my mom....i dunno...but I'm definately staying home tonight!  I'm gonna go to bed on time tonight too and get myself back into a night sleeper routine instead of the day sleeper that I am now!  Midnights screw with you man...i don't recommend them at all!          Haven't had a response from Andrew concerning my email yet...but the wedding in Illinois is today, so I really don't expect him to write me back or call me till he gets back...so we'll see!  I will be sure to keep you all updated as news happens!!          Anyhow, I am off to clean myself up and actually smell pretty again!     Have a good one y'all!!

        Hey, its Friday, and its going much better than yesterday!!      I woke up this afternoon to some better news than when I woke up yesterday!  A member of the school of where my mom teaches came by yesterday afternoon with gallons of paint and paint samples and told us to pick out the ones we wanted and he would paint free of charge!!  How great is that?!      Our house is coming along nicely as well!  The renovations are more fun than I thought!  Today we picked out paint colours and started picking out possible colors for drapes or valances!!!   I can't wait to see what it looks like when it's all done!!          So, I heard from Andrew today, after I sent him an email first.  Apparently, the reason he hasn't communicated with me is because he is working.  I didn't realize it was that hard not to send your girlfriend a simple email or phone call to let her know what is going on and how you're doing!  I guess I was just feeling ignored and replaced by work!  Still, a simple email or phone call would have been nice!  I still don't know what to think...because in his email he apologizes profusely and tells me he loves me and misses me...  If he missed me and loved me as much as he says he does...then why didn't he make any attempt to communicate with me in a whole week and doesn't even call to say bye before he goes to Illinois!  The more I think about it...the more confused I get!          I haven't heard anything about my aunt lately, only that I know she has a nurse in 4 hours a day to administer the morphine and that she doesn't have any more pain... Now, its just the proverbial waiting game...oh joy, oh bliss...      I also have to work tonight...  I wasn't supposed to, but Steph called me and asked me to take her shift tonight.  She had to work at her other job today and Chris wouldn't leave her house till super late last night and she called me in tears asking me to take her shift.  She wasn't feeling well either, so I agreed that I would take it...  she owes me big!  Anywho, I'm off for the night....I have shower, eat dinner and get ready for work.  I will talk to you all later! Have a good one! Later y'all!

        Okay...talk about the shittiest day ever! My mom wakes me up this afternoon to tell me that my aunt's liver cancer is incurable and its only a matter of time before it takes a hold of her...I just don't understand...but i guess I'm not supposed to...it just sucks! All I can think of now are my little cousins, Zach and Connor and thinking that within a matter time they won't have a mother....and it rips my heart out... I am just afraid that they will be uprooted to a place where they won't be able to flourish and be happy...but ultimately, that's not anyone's decision but my Aunt Amanda's.&nbsp; And I pray she makes the right one!&nbsp; I hope she can see that her boys would be happiest with my mom, if it came down to it...  Not only did all this shit occur today (in a matter of two hours), I am beginning to give up on Andrew.&nbsp; He left for Illinois today and didn't even call to say bye or anything.&nbsp; So i emailed him to inquire as to why he hasn't communicated with me in the past week.&nbsp; I am beginning to think he is giving up on me too...why the fuck me?     I am starting to think that I will never find true happiness...maybe I will just get another dog! A failsafe solution!!&nbsp; A dog will be there no matter what...right?       &nbsp;   I hung out with Whit, Steph, Bill, and Chris tonight...I needed to get out of my house and away from all of this for a little while.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went to whit's at 930, after an average night of pool...and we went to Steph's to hang out and watch a movie.&nbsp; We ended up going to get ice cream at Baskin Robbins and it was the first time all day that i hadn't thought of anything else than just having fun with my friends!!&nbsp; I really needed that!&nbsp; Then Steph, Chris and i went back to her house and watched the Butterfly Effect...awesome movie...and I just got back home a half hour ago...and im slowly getting tired...but i have waaaaay too much on my brain.       &nbsp;   Anyhow, I should head out and maybe try and catch some sleep...     Operative word here is 'try'.     'night y'all!

        Hey all....back again!      Confusion, confusion, confusion, is all that is going through my head right now...not only in my own life, but also concerning the rest of my family...       &nbsp;   As some of you already know, my aunt Amanda was diagnosed with cancer back in October, and she went for checkup two days ago and it was found that her cervical cancer was gone but to the dismay of everyone, the doctors found a spot on her liver.&nbsp; So, now she is back off to Kingston for three treatments of chemotherapy.&nbsp; I guess we are all planning for the worst now, but we all have to maintain a postive attitude for Zach and Connor.&nbsp; Things are just messed right now...this sucks...       &nbsp;   My own personal life is confused right now too....I really don't know what is going on..     I haven't spoken to my boyfriend in 6 days, except for 10 minutes on Monday night...makes me start to think that something is up... or maybe I'm just paranoid.. who knows...     ...i dunno...     Can you see why I'm confused...       &nbsp;   I need more nights like this past Saturday!!&nbsp; I have never had so much fun on a night out than that night!!&nbsp; We started at my friend Steph's house,(who i also work with), then we went to the Junction, where I had the best time ever there, hands down!&nbsp; We danced, drank, and sat out on the patio and made some new friends!&nbsp; It was by far the best time I had ever had there!!       &nbsp;   So after tonight, I have four days off work!!&nbsp; And I have no idea what I am going to do with all my time...I know i am going out with a couple friends on thursday night to go play pool...and again possibly on saturday...but everything is up in the air really...plans are probably going to be made tonight hopefully!       &nbsp;   Anyway, I am gonna head out now...I am sure I will write more later!!     Love y'all! Nat       &nbsp;

        Hey All.... So this is sooo new for me!&nbsp; Thanks to a friend of mine I got this started (thanks doug!). I have always wanted an online journal for some reason...i guess I don't mind sharing my life with everyone...go figure!  So its tuesday and i have only been home about 5 days...thanks to Flood Day, July 15th,2004!&nbsp; I guess you could say we lucky and unlucky in that respect.&nbsp; Unlucky in the fact that we got like 5ft in our basement and lost absolutely everything down there.&nbsp; And lucky in the fact that we actually didn't have a river flowing thru our house like people down the street did...insanity is the only word I have for that!       &nbsp;   So it's tuesday and this is the 6th day in a row that I have had to work too...gotta love filling in on midnights for the guy who just quit!&nbsp; Thank god i get to work with a girl who i actually get along with...instead of Gunt-actular's friend, who I really don't think I got along with...meh...whatever!       &nbsp;   So it's tuesday, and I really haven't spent much time with my boyfriend in about 6 days.&nbsp; Dear Andrew lives in North York and is just getting over being sick...is there a bug going around...because I haven't got it yet, and normally I'm one of the first to get it!&nbsp; He is also busy with work lately too...landing big accounts and bringing in the dough!&nbsp; Atta boy, baby!&nbsp; Keep up the hard work!  So, its tuesday, and I got a call from creditors today, indicating to me that i owe money on my student loan...no shit, sherlock!&nbsp; Who doesn't owe money on their student loans!?&nbsp; It would also help if the person on the other end of the phone could actually speak english.&nbsp; How much do you all want to bet the half the people working at that call center don't realize how hard it is to make those kind of payments when you only bring in $500 bux a month????&nbsp; Gimme a break here folks....like really!  So it's tuesday, and i only have one more shift left this week, then it's 4 days off!!&nbsp; Sweetness!!&nbsp; I'm really not sure how I am going to spend my time off...but I am sure I can think of something...I will be more than happy to take any ideas!!  So it's tuesday, and I was supposed to have a job interview yesterday with Robert Half Legal in Ottawa, but she failed to call me, after I had replied to her email...I guess I could have called there and inquired..but I didn't...meh...oh well!  Anywho, I am off to finish my dinner...yah, I know it's kinda late...but that is what i get when i work at 11pm!  Later y'all...love ya!

      Today was probably the most easy day of my life!!  I got home this morning at 730am, checked my email. Wrote a couple then went to bed for 4 hours. It was a great 4 hours of sleep though!!  I got up at 12:15 to find dear Thomas waiting for me on msn while on his lunch break....waiting for me...I think I got the upper hand now Thomas!  :P  Again, I did nothing today...I have been pretty tired most of the day...but I just did my thing today and emailed back and forth with Tom and chatted to him again on msn at 4.  And he called me at like 430...but I was making dinner.  Chicken Fajitas!  Again, I have the upper hand there too...in oh so many ways!  And don't you try and argue that Tom!  I had you wrapped around my finger when I said I was making dinner!  LOL!  Tonight I'm staying at my aunts house in Keene...I really don't know why..but our house is still a mess and our flooring is being installed tomorrow!  We are going to be pretty much done here by Sunday hopefully!  Most of the painting is done and it looks incredible!  Most of you who remember what my house looked liked before...its gonna be totally different!  I might actually want to come home now...  Anyway, I am off for now...I will talk to you all later for sure! Love y'all! Nat (N-Lo, as now referenced by a male friend of mine!)

      Wow, today sucked for doing stuff.... I stayed home all day today, and did nothing!  Okay, well I can't say nothing.  I had a inquiry for a job today...so I am registered at Robert Half Legal ( a staffing agency) in Ottawa and Toronto...so now I wait for them to call me and find me a job and an interview!  I could be fully employed within two and half weeks...how crazy is that!? The range that I would cover would be as far as Ottawa to Barrie.  Ideally Toronto would be best, because it is closer to home...but i will take anything really! I guess I should get my references in order eh?!  So yah, I did nothing all day today except talk to Thomas...  How's work treatin ya man?  Did you get lots done today?  He is probably going to get in shit one of these days for sending so many emails back, when they have nothing to do with his job!  LOL!  i would laugh!  sorry man, I think that would be hilarious!! HAHAHAHA!!!!  Then you would just be stuck to resorting to calling me!  So I go back to work tonight...I just had two days off!  I am working midnights this week and probably next week.  But I will be working with the Jenn I like, so it won't be too bad!!  I just hate midnights...but when they are with a person i get along with, it makes the night go by so much easier!!  I should be sleeping right now...but I promised a friend of mine to stay on till 4 so we can talk!  That's how much of a stellar friend I can be!  I heard from Valery today!  it was nice to get an email from her.  She is having a "thing" on the sunday of labour day weekend, so I am gonna try and see what I can do to get down there for the night!  Anywho, I am off for a bit...I will talk to you all later! have a good one! Love ya! Natty P

       Hey All! I had a pretty good day today actually!  I did virtually nothing, but it was good!    I went to work this morning from 820 to 1150am at the courthouse.  It was a laid back day there today...the courts were busy with pleas and sentencing today, but I ended up getting everything done!!  I was home by 12:15!!      When I got home, I talked to Tom on msn for a bit on his lunch; then we swapped emails back and forth most of the afternoon!  I ended up giving him my number today and thinking he wouldn't call me at least until the weekend...he called me tonight!  I totally wasn't expecting him to!  We chatted for about a half hour, I think!  I really didn't time the call..but whatever!  It was a great convo!      I have my interview tomorrow for a job in ottawa!  Its a far way away but we will see how it goes!  I'm still not sure if I want to go to Ottawa or not....I would like find something that is a bit closer to home or in the Toronto area...better pay!  I don't know, we'll see what happens...only time will tell!    Anyway, I am for the night!!  I will more than likely talk to you all later at some point!   'night!   love you all!   Nat

I'm going out tomorrow night with Steph, Loretta and possibly Jeff...not sure who else is going...Troy can't make it b/c he is at an Argo's game...oh well, another night!  I'm thinking we should just all reschedule so everyone can make it out!  but it will be nice to get out for a night!  My little Seppy (cousin Connor) is here till Wednesday this week.  Then he is going back tothe cottage with a little friend of his.  It will be nice to see him for a couple days!

      So I did it!  I broke up with Andrew.  The only unfortunate thing....I had to send it in an email. I didn't want to do it that way, because I know what they are like...but there was no other way to get a hold of him.  So I'm single again.  And I'm not even single 48 hours and I'm being set up already!! LOL! More details about that to come later!  I have to keep you in suspense somehow so you keep coming back to my blog!!  LOL!  I feel like a weight has been lifted...  I can be me again!!!  Nat!

      Hey all!  Today has been a pretty good actually.  I had a great day at work with everyone there...and we absolutely killed ourselves laughing most of the day!  It was awesome!  But when I got into work this morning, Steph and Loretta were working nights and they came up to this morning before they left and they asked me what I was doing on Tuesday night...I said nothing...then they said that they were going to set me up with someone.  Obviously its someone they both know and that is a very limited amount of people....and I figured out it was Troy.  He is a guy a I met through Bill and Loretta.  He is super funny and a really sweet guy!  So I guess we will see what happens on Tuesday...  When I got home from work this afternoon I was pretty tired and really didn't want to do a whole lot tonight...but Whit and I went for a tan, grocery shopping for her mom, and for ice cream.  It was nice to hang out with just her tonight.  I haven't done that in so long because she always has Bill around.   It was nice!  We are having a girls night on Monday night and maybe gonna watch a couple movies then go for coffee and what not.  I'm actually looking forward to it! We want to make plans to go to Sandy Beach for the day...so if you want to join us and make a day of it...let either one of us know...and we can go before its cooler out....oh wait, that has been all summer!  In any case, if you are interested, post here or call me or whit!  Anywho, I am off to make myself mon diner!  Talk to you all soon! Love ya! Nat

      So yah...my day was alright.  Long, but alright.  I work all friggin day with Dee and she drives me insane...good lord, she drives me insane!  I heard from Andrew today...well does an email constitute as hearing from him?  All it tells me is that he is now going to try to come down on Monday....yah right, cuz that's gonna happen.  He gives me an excuse the day after he was supposed to come down and decides that he isn't going to call and let me know what is going on.  His parents should have a phone right?  There should be a phone at work too right?  But somehow, he just couldn't dial my number to tell me.  And now that his cell isn't working I can't get a hold of him b/c I don't know his home phone where he lives with his parents....I tried searching the net for it...but do you know how many people live in North York with the same last name?!  Yah, thanks for comin out Nat!  He wants to come down on Monday, but frankly I really don't want him here, so I told him I was working 3-11pm.  How bitchy is that?  Whatever, I'm giving up trying on my end...I've had it.  If he calls here tonight after the short email I wrote back...I will tell him what's up then. Wish me luck.  I'm probably going to the movies tonight with Whit and Steph...and more than likely Bill will come too.  OH well...not sure what movie we are gonna see...but I guess we will figure that out later.  Anyhow all, I am off for a bit...I will write later! Night! Love ya! Nat

      So I didn't end up going out...waaay too tired for my own liking!!  And I never got a call from Andrew.  I really can't and don't want to deal with this anymore...  like fuck...what the fuck do I do to deserve this...boyfriends who never call or make an effort to communicate...  Anyway, I need to go and simmer down... Talk later, nat

      Okay...so what is with my instinct being totally right here?? Did I get a call you ask?....no Did I get an email telling me as to what was going on?.....no Did I deserve this?....no I just don't know what to do anymore. ...everytime I get pissy or angry with Andrew, my feelings for him come right back up to the surface...wtf is going on here....I don't get any communication on this end...and I'm sending emails everyday and the only response I get at any time is a short piddly little thing that shouldn't even constitute as an email..Yah, thanks for comin' out!  What the fuck do I do, I'm really getting frustrated here???  So, therefore, I made other plans for tonight!!  I'm off to Dubs' with Whit, Bill and Mar.   I worked today too...7-3.  It wasn't too bad today actually...it was a pretty good shift.  I worked drive-thru.  Anywho, I'm gonna give'r for the night...I will chat to y'all later! Nat

        Hey all!          It wasn't a bad day today actually...I thought it might go by a bit slower but it didn't, surprisingly enough!!  I was at the courthouse today filling in a day of prep time for the Provincial Prosecutor.  So what I did today was I went through about 150 files to make sure they were ready to be given out to proper counsel and agents or the accused.  I did a lot photocopying and such...but I actually love doing that kind of thing...I read over the files and I get to see what kind offences people commit! Don't worry, I'm sworn to secrecy, so if I have seen your name anywhere in there...my lips are sealed!          I really love what I do at the courthouse...I wish this would turn into a full time thing and I would end up being Andrew's (Prov. Pros.) law clerk/secretary.  I really wouldn't mind that at all!  Even getting paid at least 13 bux an hour would be nice for me!          So I have a couple options for tonight...either go to the Ex with Bhitney and her team from MCCI or Tom, Matt and a couple others at the Junction....and I'm really thinking that I'm not gonna do either.  I am tired and exhausted and I'm in somewhat of a bitchy mood...I just feel like I will snap on someone if I see or talk to anyone tonight...I    'm gonna chill out here tonight and read a book I think...I want some time to myself and I haven't had much of that lately.  Plus sometimes people just piss me off... Sorry guys...no dice tonight!          So I have to keep tomorrow free...I get an email from Andrew today telling me that he is trying to get down here tomorrow night...what are the chances that he isn't going to come or give some excuse that he won't be able to make it...because I have a feeling that might happen.  I don't know...but its just a feeling...          Once again, I'm missing Zach and Connor like crazy...I wanted to see them off on Wednesday morning...but I knew that it was gonna be waaaay to hard to say bye to them again when I know they are going to a place that really really really don't want to be...so I stayed in bed... I know they are going to be back here anyway, when school starts up and again in a week and half when Zach has hockey camp...so it will be somewhat normal again!          Anywho, I am off for a bit...I am gonna make myself some dinner...I'm starving!     Later y'all     Love ya,     Nat

      So, today is my day off...how great is that?!  And it has essentially consisted of nothing so far!  All I have done since I got up this afternoon at 1pm was trade emails back and forth with my friend Tom in Barrie!  We decided that we are going to rule the world...now its just a matter of determining our time frame of when we want to rule the world!  Yah i know...im a loser...but so is he!!  LOL!! Actually I think the word he used was a dope! hahahah!  Oh, and i also have a new thing...photoblog!!   urlLink http://natalie.buzznet.com .  Check it out...I don't have many photos right now...but if any of you have great photos that you want to post...or if you ahve any good ones of me...send them to me and I will be more than happy to post them!!  I'm thinkin I am gonna go and get myself some brekky/lunch soon...im a little hungry!! I will write more later! Love ya all! nat

        So today has been okay, for what its worth!     I did pretty much nothing today!  I wrote a few emails to friends and my boyfriend, whom I miss terribly!            Andrew is coming down on Friday night!  I can't wait to see him!!  I have to clean up my house a bit though...as much as I can at least; given that I am living in the middle of a construction zone! (Britney Spears "In the Zone" just popped into my head! OH GOD...SAVE ME!!)  In any case, it will soooo great to finally see him in almost two weeks!  wow, I can't believe it's been that long since I have seen him last!  holy mackinaw!  But this just means our time together on Friday night will be awesome!  So, if I'm a little tired on Satuday morning....its b/c I didn't get any sleep the night before!  Okay, get your minds outta the gutter for once...it's because he doesn't leave till late and I won't sleep after he leaves!          I went to work today...and we had a pretty good night actually..it wasn't over busy and I was baking..i kinda lucked out major!  I was done my kitchen by 10 or so...so I was happy...I worked with Lauren, Melissa, Nicole and Dee.  And we had a pretty fun actually!  I love with working with Melissa, Lauren and Nicole, we have a great time when we work together!  I wore a headset tonight jsut so I could communicate with them all night!  Dee is alright...but she is just a little different...but okay...          My boys go back to the cottage with thier mom tomorrow...its gonna be a rough day, that's for sure!  I might sleep in so I really don't have to say bye to them tomorrow..b/c I know I will cry.  It's so hard to send them back to a place they really don't want to be...and you know full well that they want to be here.  It just sucks! Sucks ass!          I got to thinking the other day, I don't spend as much time with my best friend Valery anymore.  We both really don't know what is going on in each other's lives since she moved back to Oshawa and out on her own with Mike to Whitby.  And I honestly don't know why that happened....well, yah i do...we have been busy here with our own stuff, and they have been busy there with their stuff...unfortunately it happens.. I don't like it...but its happened to us!  We don't really talk anymore of the stuff we used to...Its hard when its a long distance thing, and long distance charges get in the way.  I dunno...maybe I'm on crack when it comes down to this too....          Anywho, I should head off to bed and get some half decent sleep...i actually got quite a bit last night for once!  it was great!!  Anyway, I will be sure to write more tomorrow...talk later! Night y'all!     Love you!     natalie

       My night is going pretty well!        The boys are here and we ordered pizza for dinner and hung out here....then my cousins decided that they wanted to go for a bike ride and I was the one to go with them!  I thought it was going to be a leisurly bike ride around rotary trail...little to my knowledge that I was going bike all the way across town to Whitefield Drive!   It was a great trek and I feel great after I did it!  It took us about 45 minutes to do...and a great way to burn off my dinner!  I should do that every night!!   Thanks Zach and Connor, I had a great time...but next time, if we are gonna go that far...tell me to put on proper shoes before we leave the house!!  LOL!!!      Anywho, I'm off....I might head to bed early tonight and get some half decent sleep...yah, right! lol!   Love you all!   Nat

       Hey, its Monday again!  Back to work for some, day off for others...  Today was a pretty good day, so far at least!  The only downfall was that I didn't get woken up for breakfast at Smitty's this morning...I was kinda pissed off.  I was the only one who didn't go, because someone failed to remember about me and wake me up.  I love being forgotton about...its so great!  So I ended up getting up at 130, just in time for me go to my aunts house for a bit, or else I would have been forgotton about  again!        We got to my aunts house around 2 and waited for Char to be done her appointment at Trent.  She got in!! Congrats Char! Her getting in there really makes me want to go back to school....political studies might be an idea!!  who knows...i have so many options as what to do....and I always keep changing my mind...      Anywho, once Char got back we all went go-karting to wild, water and wheels!  I haven't done that in forever!  It was a lot of fun!  My cousin Phil, made me end up crashing into the tires about halfway thru...and Zach got booted off the course for one too many crashes!!  Atta go Zach!!  LOL!      It has been so nice having the boys here, and if the tidbit of information I heard the other day is true...then well....needless to say, we will be happy here for a long time!!!  But you didn't hear it from me!  wink wink!!  They will only be gone for a week, and then they will be back here for hockey camp and then school starts up again!!   They have another day and a half here...they leave on wednesday afternoon after Amanda has her appointment with Dr. Beamish.      Its gonna be so weird not starting school in September.  I have started school in September for as long as I can remember and this year I'm not...its kinda weird.  Kinda makes me feel like I have to grow  up a bit....yuck!  And frankly, I'm not entirely ready to do that yet!!      I am working at the Courthouse this week, two days next week and two days the week after that!!  I'll be making just over 18 dollars an hour and I get paid for mileage for my two days in Lindsay!!  I figured that before taxes, I will make about $1800!!!  So I am gonna save that money for my trip to Banff in October and take Andrew out for dinner probably and go up and visit him in TO!!      Anyways all, I think i am gonna head out and start making some dinner for the crew!  I will be online most of the night probably...so feel free to message me!   I will talk to y'all later!   Love ya,   Nat

       Sunday, once again!!  Weeks just seem to fly by lately...and i don't know why...its crazy!!         Today I slept in as much as I could and I came out my aunt Alma's and chilled out there with my cousins and the rest of my family!  It is so nice to have them here for 5 days.  I really don't want them to go back.  I know they have to because they have to be with their mom during this time...but when school starts I can't wait to have them back!     We just chilled out here today...had dinner, went 4 wheelin', had a pretty good time.  The only unfortunate thing is that I have to work tonight at 11.  I hate midnights with a passion.  And not only that...but i have to work at 3pm tomorrow!  So, it works out that I am working 16 of the next 24 hours...how retarded is that?!      We ended up going to the Trash last night for Stef's 20th birthday.  I had to work till 11, so we showed up a bit late..but had fun nonetheless!!  Happy B-day Stef!!      Okay, so I have started thinking that I may end up going back to school here at Fleming and get my law clerking diploma and find a clerking job here.  I really wouldn't mind that I don't think!  It isn't all bad here in good ol' p-dot..but that just means I will have to move out soon, or find a clerking job in Toronto.  I want to be close to Andrew too if things work out with him for long term.  I really want them to work out long term.  That boy is perfect!!  I guess that is why I love him so much!!    I have made plans to go with Steph (from Timmy's) to go to Banff in October!  I think I will save the money I make at the courthouse this month to go there!  We are planning on going for 10 days before Thanksgiving.  Partying up in Banff should be a blast!!    Anyhow I am off for the night...gonna go have a coffee with the fam!!  I will talk to y'all later on!   Love you!   Nat

       Hey All!!      So my boys, Zach and Connor are home for a few days till Wednesday!!!  I was so happy to see them this morning!  I told my mom last night before I went to work for her to wake me up when they got here this morning...not only wasn't it  her that woke me up, but Connor.  I heard a little knock on my bedroom at 1115 this morning and the next thing i hear is his voice on the side of the door!  I thought my heart skipped a beat I was so happy to hear it!  He came in a gave a huge hug!! It was soooo awesome to see his smiling face after three weeks!!  What a day!!!      I wish I didn't have to work tonight, so I could spend some time with them..but I can do that for most of the day tomorrow!!  I am working lots...so hopefully I can spend a day with just them on my own...that would be priceless to me!      I am fianlly back to work this week...and I started back on midnights.  And needless to say, last night was the most eventful midnight to date.  Thanks to Bhitney, and the Gunt; me, Stef, Jenn and Loretta are once again dragged into the middle of it all.  Whit actually pissed me off last night with the way she came back to Timmy's and started accusting Loretta of being the Gunt's insider.  I thought shit was gonna hit the fan last night.  And the only person I feel sorry for in the whole situation is Steph.  She has been dragged into the middle of this without being asked...and there are accusations that are being said about her by the Gunt, that are untrue.  And frankly I know Whitney wants us to feel sorry for her, but she brought this on herself when she started sleeping with Bill and took him into her home...   The whole situation is fucked....not other word for it but fucked.      I talked to Andrew yesterday...well it was an email and he wants to come down on Monday, but unforturnately, the only full day I have off this week is wednesday.  Every other night, after that, I am done at 530, and then 3...so hopefully he will be able to make it down this week sometime!!  I can't wait to see him!!  I miss him just as much as I miss Zach and Connor!      I have plans to go out tonight..but I'm thinking I may be to damn exhausted to go out...I would feel terrible that I missed Stef's birthday thing...but I don't want to comprimise that with the lack of sleep, because I haven't been getting much lately!  I am feel like my body is suffering b/c of it!  I'm starting to feel like crap and I almost passed out at work this morning at 530am.  So I know I'm over tired!  I'm actually gonna go and sleep for a couple more hours before I have to go into work at 7.      Anywho, I'm outtie...I will write later on!   Love you all!   Nat

       Hey!      Today ended up being a pretty laid back day.  I got up late and just kinda hung around the house today.  My family came over today and my uncle did some of the trimming and put in our new basement door.  My brother and cousin did mudding today and filled in the holes in the wall and any cracks that were visible.  Our house is slowly coming together!!  We get our furniture on Tuesday!      I talked to Andrew last night and it was sooooo great to hear his voice!  I hadn't talked to him in over a week and I told him everything of what is going on here!  Saying "i love you too" came so easy last night...it felt so great!!  Things are once again amazing between us...I was stupid to ever question that is wasn't!      It was  pretty laid back day today...I tried to sleep for and hour and a bit tonight..but with the whole family here, it was kinda hard to do!  oh well!  Tonight will be a rough one then!!      I have to send a $155 dollar cheque to OSAP tomorrow too...damn payments can lick my ass!  But the quicker I get the cheque sent out...the quicker they are off my ass!      Anywho, I am off for the night!  I will write more tomorrow probably!   Lates y'all   Love ya!

       Hey all!  Today was pretty good, considering all the bullshit that has been going on for the past two days.  There is more anger flying through my family than I ever thought possible and it is all at the expense of Zach and Connor.  No one seems to take into account what they want...what their best interests will be.  But now I have to be patient and only time will tell what will really happen.      Today was a pretty easy going day.  I got up at 11:30, was up for about an hour and half, then I went back to bed till 2:30, until my mom woke me up and told me that Char was on her way over to go swimming.        So she got here, we were going to go swimming until we pulled the solar blanket back and found a dead groundhog floating in the pool.   We kinda changed our minds about the whole swimming thing and recovered it up and left!  My uncle Ed went back later to get it out!  So we decided to go back out to Keene and hang out there for a while.  I got home around ten to 6 and I called Andrew.      When I called him he was a car dealership looking at new cars because he totalled it this past weekend.  He ended up rolling it one and a half times into a meridian on an on-ramp on his way home from Illinois.  His left arm is scratched up pretty bad and he is really sore from the whole ordeal.  I was just happy to hear his voice today when he called me back.  I told him about Amanda and what is going on here...and how messed up things are lately here.  He was so reassuring and comforting; it was great!  I really needed to hear his voice, to tell me that he loves me.   And this time when I said it back to him it was so easy to say; I realize how much I do love him and how worried about him I was for the past week.  It was just soooo good hear his voice!  I don't know when he will be down next to see me...but maybe I will end up going up there for a day and spending a Saturday or Sunday with  him and finally meeting his parents!   I will see what happens.  This might be an opportunity for me to show him that this relationship is important to me by going up there for a day.      Char and I went to see Catwoman last night!  Talk about the ulitmate girl power movie!  It was actually pretty good.  I wish I had a body like Halle Berry...good lord she's hot!  And amazing teeth!!  We were gonna see Anchorman, but Char had already seen it and I didn't want her to watch a movie a second time....so we saw Catwoman instead.  We had a good time!  It was the first time that Char and I actually hung out on our own...regardless of the 5 year age difference, we are cousins, and get along pretty well.  I think I can relate more to what is going on in her life than anyone else in our family because I don't judge what is gong on, and jump to irrational conclusions.  She's grown up a lot and is doing normal things for her age...but there are others who don't see that!      Anywho, I am off for a bit...I will talk to y'all later! Love you!   Nat

        So today ended up being okay...okay for what it's worth...      My aunt and her boys is all we have been talking about for a day and a half now...and whenever I think of it, it makes me sad.  I get tears in my eyes.     And the living situation that they are in right now isn't helping either...and noone sees that but my mom, my aunt alma, and now thankfully my oma!          I'm just tired from crying...we need to hear some positive news for once.  Or something good needs to happen....fast!  We are all slowly starting to think the worse.           Amanda starts her second round of treatments at the end of the month.  They are giving her some sort of modified version of chemotherapy.  But everyone at home knows what happened the first time she had chemo....          My mom, who is ever-springing fountain of hope and faith, is slowly giving up on her as well...and it hurts me to no end to see my mom suffer through all of this too.  I just wish there was something I could do.  More so, something for those boys.  I need to have them here with us...my mom needs them here.  Zach and Connor want to be here...but Amanda and Ann don't see that.  They don't see that they are miserable.  I jsut want them here!          On a better note, our basement is halfway done and we get our new stuff in a week!!  We will still be living in a construction zone, but it will all be worth it in the end.          Stef's birthday is on Saturday....so I will definately have to go and see her for her birthday...I can't cut myself off from them entirely...I need my friends too!  However, I did cancel the pool party that was originally going to run tomorrow....I just want to spend time with the family right now.  I think that is my most important priority!!          Anyhow, I called Andrew tonight at 8:00 before I went out for the night.  I was kinda frustrated that he didn't call before that.  So he is calling me tomorrow when he is off work so we can talk.  It should be an interesting conversation to say the least.  It was  nice to hear his voice today though.  I haven't heard it in over a week and half.  So i will be sure to fill you all in as tothe happenings with my dear boyfriend.          Anyway, I am gonna try and get some decent sleep tonight.  Tomorrow is a carefree day that is going to spent lounging by the pool with my family.  Tomorrow would be perfect if Zach and Connor were there!          Goodnight all!  I love you!     Nat

        hey all So today is hard too.  Everyone who sees me today asks me how I am, and I just end up crying.  Yesterday was awesome in the fact that I got to see my cousins, Zach and Connor, who are like my brothers!  I just wanted to hug them both soooo hard and take them home with us yesterday.  They both came up to me within an hour of being there and both asked me if I would take them home with me last night from the cottage.  They aren't happy there and its only half of the family who sees that.  My aunt Amanda and Ann and Uncle Martin don't see how unhappy they are there.  They don't see that Zach and Connor are happiest when they are in Peterborough, when they are with my mom...the whole situation is fucked. But when it comes down to it....and the boys don't end up with us, we will end up contesting the will and seeking what is ultimately better for the boys in the long run.  They just can't be uprooted from everything they have here and move to a place where they have nothing...I can't live with that, and niether can the majority of my family... But we can only wait and see what unfolds...          I am finally gonna talk to Andrew tonight too...i know I am going to be a mess tonight...I'm going to call him in an hour or so and talk to him...I will let you all know what is up with that too...          This week has sucked royally...and I have feeling its just gonna get worse...and there is nothing, absolutely nothing that I can do...just wait...  Waiting sucks...

        So all I have been doing for the past 5 hours is cry.... Today was one of the hardest days of my life, knowing that it might be last time I see my aunt amanda...and I look at her boys and they have no idea what is going on...and it tears me up inside...I can barely type this now....I'm in tears...bawling actually... And then when I get home I find out that my boyfriend totalled his car in New York.  THankfully he is okay...he finally called me today!       I really need to hear is voice... anyway, I should go and get some sleep...if i can... love you all! nat

        Hey!     I just thought I would write a small post before I head out for the day to my aunt's cottage for our oh so famous family days at the lake.  Even my aunt Ellie and Uncle Marty are going to be there too.  The only ones who will be missing will be my cousins Ashley and Andrea.  Ashley is in Whistler, so she has a reason. And Andrea is working at Camp B'nai Brith all summer, so she has a reason too.  I guess it would have been nice if all us could have spent today together, but we can't!  Hopefully we will have more family days at the lake in the future.     Anywho, I'm outtie for now.  I will be back later to let y'all know how the day went today! Love y'all!     Lates

        Hey All!     Today was a pretty good day I guess.  I got up at 2 this afternoon after falling asleep sometime shortly after 4.  I had so much on my mind last night!  Plus midnights really mess with your body!          I ended up going to see Steph at work at 230am and got myself a tea...she was working with supervisor Jen, who we both don't like...so I thought I would go save her for at least a half hour!  We had a good chat too!  I really needed to!  I had to get some stuff of my chest about Andrew, and how much I really miss him and still wondering why the only contact I've had from him in a week now is an email I got from him on thursday.  I keep shifting back and forth as to my feelings towards him and I really don't know what to do....arg!  I'm getting more confused everyday!          We are all going to my aunt Ann's cottage tomorrow to see my aunt Amanda, Zach and Connor!  I miss the boys like crazy!  I actually hate not having them around...life is a little empty with them not around everyday!  We are actually going up there tomorrow because my aunt Amanda wanted us all up there to visit.  She is on morphine now, so she is mentally alert for bit through the day to actually visit.            She did her will yesterday with my uncle Marty.  And now my mom is paranoid that if anything happens to my aunt Amanda, she won't get custody of her boys.  I told my mom not to think of that right now and just concentrate on helping Amanda feel more comfortable and do what she can for the boys and Amanda right now.  I just can't wait to see them all tomorrow!!          So today we finished peeling the wall paper out of our hallway and now we only have to clean two more walls of our bathroom and strip one more small wall of the hallway (if any of you who have been in myhouse, the small wall on the way up to  mine and Brads' rooms).  So it looks good.  As good as can be expected when we are in the middle of renovations!!  I'm so excited to see the final product!!           We also decided today that we are going to get the bigger television that we wanted at the Brick!  My brother and I figured, bigger room, bigger t.v.!  26" is sooo much better than 20"!!          In any case, I'm gonna head out for now...I will write more tomorrow!     Love y'all!
