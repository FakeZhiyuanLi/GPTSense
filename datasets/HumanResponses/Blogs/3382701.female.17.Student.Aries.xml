      Well hello there... I know I'm being stupid to switch blogging sites, but I stumbled across this in my journey through the good ol' information superhighway today, and it looked pretty cool. (Don't bother pointing out that it doesn't have any more features that livejournal.com :-P I like the way this one *looks*, so nerrr). Still at TAFE... procrastinating... With you-know-who sitting next to me again. I'm already that close to strangling him. How am I meant to survive another one and a half years of this with *him* here??? It seems the more I try to avoid/ignore him, the more annoying he gets! Some people just don't get it. *big sigh* Still didn't have the rest of my team here to work on our group assignment today. Jeannie dubbed me team leader cuz I'm the only one who has a clue about what we're doing... and cuz I'm here. Was really looking forward to this project, but I'm already getting over it, cuz I don't think anyone else shares my enthusiasm for it, and so far I'm the only one who's seen the movie we're reviewing. (RUN LOLA RUN, for anyone who's interested. It's good stuff). So yeah, I'm just dawdling cuz I don't know what I'm meant to be doing with that and can't be bothered doing maths right now. I'm gonna get home this arvo and have to leave within half an hour cuz Michelle has got me teaching the tap class tonight before I go to my own jazz class. It's freaking me out a bit, but I don't think it'll be too hard... maybe even fun if I'm lucky! She says if I do well, she'll give me some more classes to teach, and I might end up replacing the current teacher she has (who isn't all that great). Ooh, note to self: remember to visit www.take40.com when I get home. *thumbs up* Can finally listen to stuff on the net now that we have ADSL. *scrolls up* Wow... I certainly had a bit of a ramble today! Maybe it's the new site. You gotta admit it's pretty funky! Anywho, I'm over it. Running outta stuff to talk about. I shall return. Bye for now!
