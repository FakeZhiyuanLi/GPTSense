      I was watching a show the other night on PBS about electric and hydrogen cars. One point that they failed to emphasize is that although hydrogen cars produce no emissions themselves, that the hydrogen itself is processed and stored using energy sources from oil, coal, petroleum, etc. While fuel efficiency and emissions reduction/elimination should be the focus of the auto industry, it should also be the focus of local, state, and federal governments to improve and increase public transportation. I'm originally from Cincinnati, which is probably like other medium-sized metropolitan areas in terms of bus service: limited and slow. Philadelphia is much more convenient to navigate without a car,which was one of the determining factors in my decision to move here. One of the best ways to decrease auto-related pollution is to increase public transportation options.

      The purpose of this blog is to be anonymous; to write stuff without feeling like I need to censor myself. It's so interesting to me to read other blogs about people's day-to-day lives. You would think that this would be boring, and many people would probably describe their lives as routine or monotonous. Yet reading these reflections and musings makes one realize that life is really in the details, and that this "day-to-day" IS your life. As John Lennon said, life is what happens while you're making other plans.

      Bush is so stupid that it's infuriating!!!!! It seems to me that there should be an IQ test to be President. I'm not the type of person who gets upset easily, but he truly makes me ashamed that he is the leader of this country. I can't understand why Republicans support him either. If Kerry was that much of a bumbling idiot I'd be super pissed at the Democrats for letting him get on a ballot.

       Everyone wants the quick fix. Businesses, politicians, HMO's, and drug companies want to sell the idea of the quick fix as well. A recent New York Times article discusses the split among psychologists who rely on more talking, intuitive therapy, and those who feel that therapy based on empirical research and proven results should be the focus of treatment. Some HMO's will limit and deny treatment if "results" or improvements aren't achieved within a set amount of time. Can you expect to treat serious mental health issues within 10 treatments? Can the human psyche be explored and tweaked so promptly? The bottom line is that extensive treatment hurts the bottom line, and HMO's don't want to pay to fix those who are depressed and down-trodden. It seems to me that people who are depressed are more easily prone to the commercial pitches of instant weight lose, cellulite treatments, teeth whiteners, hair dye, and so on. Depression feeds consumerism, along with the hope that the quick fix actually does exist, and comes in a bottle or pill.

      Christy, my brother, and I went to first friday in Olde City this weekend. We were originally going to a gallery that was BYOB, but instead decided to walk around 2nd street drinking our 6-pack of Labatt's. At first I was a bit reserved about the idea, but for the most part people didn't notice. It's fun to challenge the status quo and to freak out the people who did seem uptight about us walking around enjoying are cold brews. After the six pack ran out, we made a pit stop at some random dive-ish bar, loading the juke box with crappy songs that we thought would play after we left. However, we got to witness first hand other patrons saying to one another "Who the hell played this shit!" As we left the bar, we saw a row of Harley's and Jason and I decided to hop on one while Christy took our picture. We promptly ran away just in case the owners saw us. Out of beer, we stopped to pick up some more and make our way to the 1026 gallery. Along the way we stopped at the grave of Benjamin Franklin. Christy took a picture as we tipped our forties to him, and Jason said, "This is for my nigga B.F. I think of that dude everytime I turn on a light". And to end the night after the gallery visit, we toured an abandoned building that was being turned into condos. I stole a large, greasy bolt as a souvenir.

      I don't get paid as much as I should to do my job, and since I can't increase my pay, I've decided to decrease my productivity. I get bored surfing the internet so starting a blog seemed like something that would distract me from my other responsibilites. Will anyone read this? My god I'd be suprised if they did, and frankly I don't give a shit. I welcome any and all suggestions/comments/dirty limmericks/hate mail, etc.
