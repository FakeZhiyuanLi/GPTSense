        youve got a methodist coloring book and you color really well - but dont color outside the lines or god will send you to hell. cuz god hates war, and god hates crime, but he really hates people who color outside of the line    poltically inncorrect i'm sure... but i honestly don't care ;)   have a nice day!

      David bowie once said in the song Lets Dance:   "if you say run i'll run with you"   I wanna dance... but not the dancing he had in mind... i want to dance with the moon howl at it   to cringe and make people cry if need be... when the mood took me when it took them..  blah and so it goes and so it goes....
