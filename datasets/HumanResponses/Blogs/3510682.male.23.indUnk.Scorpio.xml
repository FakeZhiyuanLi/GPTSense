      So the job started. Nothing big has happened yet, Monday is when the real project starts, was on training until now. Hopefully, it's not 8 to 8 from then on. The training was pretty fun (?) , was alrite. learnt whole lot of SAS. I think it will take a little bit of getting used to but should be alrite.  Just to remind me .. and all who read, money isn't everything! and the feeling of having to get up and go to work is a different one. One that I am sure I will get used to. Seems like life's been pretty much the same thru undergrad, grad and now the job. Don't think i'd have it any other way. Work Hard and Enjoy the moments . That's the philosophy there.

      Almost at the end of training. glad to have had family visit, helps keep me sane. I never really thought of myself as a consulting type of person. But I guess we never know. Things happen, lives change and one fine day the engineer becomes the consultant. Not a bad life, just a different one. Someone you held becomes someone you love perhaps a natural progression. Someone I love will someday become someone who hates me ( rather bleak view of the world, I know.) but I guess that probably won't change how I feel.  &nbsp; I have discovered a few things in the past week though. As strange as it sounds, there are tons of people out there like me.. the inner discomfort in social situations is more universal than I thought. I also realized at some point, that I write these rather unstructured eclectic jumbles of words and dots probably because I don't want everyone who reads ( the very very few of you) to get it. My way of preserving some unknown about me. I wouldn't know what to do if I started communicating exceptionally well, that would almost seem like betraying myself by letting out the secret. And of course, there are some things that sound better in vague foggy thought than in concrete prose. I was out at the B&amp;N reading random books. Came across a "how to write better" type of book. I get the idea, but don't know if I want to do it. The lack of structure lets me get away with a lot and avoids the proverbial Box. The more I write, the more I feel like I would be thrown into one of the boxes, perhaps deciles to use some of the consulting talk.  &nbsp; I guess the consulting issue is going to stay, maybe the writing might become more infrequent. To quote a friend, " We know that you ( that's me) are qualified for the job. The question is are you qualified to take all that comes as a fringe "benefit" of the job?."&nbsp; If only some of the questions in this life had black and white answers, perhaps life would look less like a game of chess ( :-D ). ( personally, that sounds pretty&nbsp;funny, but left to the reader with a suggestive smiley.)&nbsp;

      I can now truely appreciate the TGIF concept. In its entirety. A really tired man must have come up with it and we thank the man for having done so. I wouldn't the weeks been exhausting but It's been long.  Don't have to show up tomorrow morning. Glad that works. Maybe I will drive into philadelphia tomorrow. Maybe not. Going to get Internet at home on sunday. Hence the weekend will be end in a good day!.  The working week cycle takes some getting used to. It takes away the basic assumption of grad school ... " Going to be here on the weekend anyway. "  For all the right or wrong reasons there is an implicit understanding that the work will end on friday ( most of the time anyway) which begs the question , " what's on this weekend?".  Strange cycle of life.

      I guess at half past midnite, the world looks a little different than it does during the day. It's all about the details like time. Time is a worthless detail with no real value but to make things seem well .. timed. Life seems to revolve around these tiny details though. It's like the way a lot of things justify themselves. By default of time. If you got there first, you get something. If you met her first, you get her. All else being equal, you'd still be the loser if you werent chronologically the first.  I guess it also gives you a way out. " I don't have the time" , or " I working on a deadline". I guess thats the way life is. I guess we miss out on a lot of stuff because we were too busy or time-constrained. The unfortunate thing is life only happens once. This is pretty much it.  Not that I am trying to sound morose. But this truly is  it .  Life's this endless stream of experiences, the more you try the more colors you have to paint into life's little coloring book.  and it's not a paint by numbers deal.

      The world is suddenly looking better again... it's Friday! . Not that I have other plans for the weekend, but for a change at least I don't have to come in tomorrow morning.  I probably feel better also because of the recent acquistion ( well technically gift.. ) of 2 really cool Pink Floyd Posters that now grace my walls. Never actually owned such huge posters but it was on the list. glad to have them. I think my apartment feels more like me now. although, the empty walls were also acceptable. Don't think I know all the floyd albums on the second poster. I might have heard the songs just not seen the album covers. Something to research.  Life is good, as always. ;-)

      Seems to a long week.... wednesday passed ever so slowly. could have sworn it wasnt about to get over. A learnt a lot today.. I guess how one sometimes has to reinvent the wheel even if it seems pointless to do so.  It was good, to learn some things about the way this business goes. Ironic, that the business of crunching numbers isn't based on accuracy but rather a faint string of events barely observable in that flood of data.

      Finally after a week of hanging around. I finally have cable. not that I have a TV yet . The Internet rocks. I've never had cable at home before. Life is good I guess.  No matter what happens I guess If you wake up above ground and can complain about work then life must be pretty good.

      So its monday again. Which probably means I am at work.. and should be at work for next 5 days.  The good news is that there is a party thing on Friday. Not that it helps the week go by any faster though.  Some golf thing on saturday as well.Might just skip that, not really sure. Plans of going to the shore sometime in the near future.
