       Welcome  yeah i know...i am terrible about email so i will probably most likely be terrible about a blog...but who knows maybe it will make me better (probably not but we can always hope)...right now i have a personal vendetta against my sister's cat....he seriously is the spawn of satan...and i think he now has developed a perverse joy at being punished....and he knows that he is being bad because he sure runs fast when he notices that i saw him do it...i am just glad that my dog is a very good dog and will be made a saint when she passes from this mortal realm (oi cheesy)....i am going to try and convince my brother to send me one of those huge spiders that are in iraq...they are huge!...like we are talking feet in size....maybe it would eat my sister's cat....well i have to go...if you can think of some creative things that can help my cat behave better please help me!!!! the squirt gun isn't working anymore

      i feel very fortunate to be an alaska...here in homer we have many things that show how special alaska is....we have the beer belly dancers.....the undulation and wave action of their massive pudgy region makes the viewer reel with nausea.....then there is the stick man....he is like the poor version of david the gnome....he makes these beautiful walking sticks that he sells on the spit....the spit is a 5 mile piece of land that juts off of the kenai peninsula....kind of like the appendix of the state.....it is home to charter offices....commercial fishing boats....various stores that want all your money and the infamous pink toilet on a telephone pole....i don't know how it got there....but it definately draws a lot of tourist attention....and many thoughts....what does it mean? what is its purpose? couldn't they find one that wasn't pink?....lots of animals are around here too...last week my friend's husband who is a commercial fisherman had a humpback whale go right through his nets....and for a week my dog kept barking at 3 in the morning...couldn't figure out why until one morning my sister stepped into bear scat.....then there is PoPo the alien moose....popo has a problem....his antlers aren't growing right....currently they are alien attenae looking things...like sticks with a ball on the end....he might be hiding in our yard to avoid the other moose that would make fun of him....but i think he is cute...plus he scares the cat so that is an added plus.....  yes alaska is a beautiful place....with the mountains and glaciers...it is like paradise....and with the right&nbsp;mix of oddness it keeps everything interesting....

      I've been watching an anime called Fruits Basket or for you more savvy anime fans...Furuba....it is soooo cute....the basis of the story is that a family is cursed by the japanese zodiac and whenever they are embraced by the opposite sex they turn into an animal represented in the zodiac.....yet i know how unrealistic this is...i wish i could have a guy that turned into something when i hugged it....i'd just do it to spite him probably....there are a lot of anime out there that is totally brain numbing but there are some really good ones....i just saw shamanic princess....beautiful animation but man the plot really sucked....it was too erratic and lacked substance when it really need it....then there are the anime that make no sense what so ever but i love them because a lot of what they say is true....i think i am among the 1% who actually understands FLCL....also the music is really good in that one....it all brings me back to the anime that started it all for me when i was kid....robotech....you can't beat giant robots...and also the fact that the bad guys had a cool name....zentradi....gotta say it again...zentradi....yeah they had skin problems but the name gives them street cred...yes anime gives you unrealistic goals of being able to fight crime in a sailor suit....but it does give you what disney can't.....priss asagiri
