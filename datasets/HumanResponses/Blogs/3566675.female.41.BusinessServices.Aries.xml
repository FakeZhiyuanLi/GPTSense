      Now that basketball season is officially over for most of us since our teams have been eliminated, it's time to begin focusing on football season. Since trash talking has been the rule for our league, I won't mention names, I've created this blog to track news and talk for the league. Pictures can also be posted, so everyone can post a picture of themselves if they have the technical know-how.  So, what you'll want to do, is join the blog, you should have gotten an invitation via email. For more information on using the blog, go to  urlLink www.blogger.com .

       Yeah, it's apparent that "Kathleen" hasn't figured this thing out yet.  What is it about women and technology?  I'm sure she'll figure it out though...by about March.  Enjoy the silence boys.      BM

      It seems that everyone has overcome the initial learning curve and joined the blog. There are three of you that haven't.  Dan Whitaker Garry Ledbetter Kathleen Powers  I think in the case of Garry and Dan, they haven't checked their email and Kathleen just has a computer problem. KATHLEEN: I'll send you another invite and have you try it again.  Now that you are a member, how do you post?  1. Go to  urlLink www.blogger.com  2. Log in using your username and password 3. See the blog listed on your dashboard page 4. Click the link to the grouplifeguy football blog 5. On the next page, you should see a page that allows you to post to the blog. 6. To actually see the blog, it's at  urlLink www.grouplifeguy.com/football.html   Everyone that hasn't posted to the blog, give it a try. Remember, you don't actually see the blog when you post to it.
