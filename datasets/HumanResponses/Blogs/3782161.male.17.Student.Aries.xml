        you were in the lunchroom after hours and my eyes crawled around and landed upon the beauty you call yourself.       my heart filled to the     brim with      longing,      i knew you were     bad for my  health       because there was another     you called your other     and that meant   i couldn’t place my hand in yours       you, who lingered in my head,      and danced in my heart     you, who i knew  i wanted from the start       you’re the prettiest flower in the most beautiful garden, and i’m the gardener  who possesses no water       my thumb is anything but     green     and i try and try     to pick out the  weeds       i finally rid my garden of them all,     but it is still incomplete     because you’re not yet there     and it is     you  i still need       so i waited for      the seasons to change     and i waited for     a person to blame     an excuse     so that i   could talk to you       then the water came     between four walls     wrapped in a blanket  of pictures in frames       you stepped through the door     my mouth mentioned a question     you answered it with your name   that’s when the water fell and the flower that is you grew in the shape of a dame, a most beautiful dame.  you faded into the distance and i still      felt     the same     although now     i knew   your name       so today,      my fingers found     your numbers     on my phone     and yours found yours  inside of your home       i talked for hours     to a most beautiful flower     i hope someday  to claim as my own

      Broken wings, dirty soul cries tears of sorrow I'm stuck in this bleeding moment I'd like to fall asleep on your dark brown hair which is as tender as a linen sheet  I've seen the flames of life dancing into your eyes Fire ceased to be alive as sorrow was poured drop by drop in your soul  You smiled at me - I kissed your eyes "Have no fear, my Lady" I spoke - fear kills  Love lies in my heart, peacefully, my dear and as the knife slept through my hands Found its case in her heart's grace

      I find it amazing that conservatives can celebrate and hope to maintain their opponents ignorance. Pathetic! That is why information is so important! Informed people make informed decisions, and like it or not, you two nameless no-hopers, people are informing themselves. Learning about iraq. Learning about the bush family. About cheney and halliburton. About our foreign policy in general, and you will be surprised, my friends, come november, that there are many MANY people who have made a decision to vote in this crucial year. People who are ashamed to have seen america's name dragged into the mud by these war criminals. These evil war profiteers, who want americans once more to stand proud on the international stage, who want to DEFEND america from these hate stirrers. These terrorist justifiers, these evil dweebs. ROLL ON NOVEMBER! WE WANT OUR COUNTRY BACK!   Lets not elect Bush again...   P.S. - I heard a bloody awesome joke, okay here it goes...                "My girlfriend said I'm a pedifile"        And I said "That's an awfully big word for an eight year old!"         Ain't that just the most misrable thing you've ever heard! I love it!

      I need to get away I need to leave this place Leave this place of where my pain thrives I want to end all my suffering  I take that rusted blade Press it against my wrist Feel it dig deeper and deeper Till i feel the blood run down my arm  When i black out It feels as though i did the right thing But then i am found by a loved one Found to be slowly dying  Then i wake I wake to the familiar feeling The feeling of white bandage Being wrapped tighter and tighter around my wrist  I am back where i started now Except everyone hates me Everyone hates me For trying to ecape

      Now you will receive us. We do not ask for your poor, or your hungry. We do not want your tired and sick. It is your corrupt we claim. It is your evil that will be sought by us. With every breath, we shall hunt them down. Each day we will spill their blood, 'til it rains down from the skies. Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace. These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior, and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth, not to push the bounds and cross over, in to true corruption, into our domain. For if you do, one day you will look behind you and you will see we three, and on that day you will reap it. And we will send you to whatever god you wish.  And Shepherds we shall be For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands So we shall flow a river forth to Thee And teeming with souls shall it ever be.  In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.

      Impressions, First always important. seemingly, yet time tells all. Impressions "Opposites always attract" (So the cliche states) at first. Your greatest foe & friend may be just like you. Impressions others try to change, to impress. but how can you be friends with another, identity. not your own? Impressions, they wither your conscience, intelligence gets wasted, on matching, accessories. Impressions Someone may be a clown, yet crying inside. You only know someone  when they let you inside thier sacred soul. Impressions.

      "Good versus evil" is relative; it presents an ambiguous paradigm for moral judgement, and yet it is the only framework offered by the monotheistic religions of the West.   Anyone can have an opinion about virtually anything. Institutions encourage us to consider the opinions they sell as "facts" and that we "believe" rather than question the morality they pitch. Friction between alternative belief structures is healthy in a polite society, and sometimes interactions that shoot off sparks conclude in consensus or a change of attitudes. But often these debates end up in stalemate with the opponents baiting each other and skipping reason altogether.  Benjamin Huff relates in The Te of Piglet:  A peasant and his son had their only horse run away from them. Neighbors said, "oh how sad!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?  The next day, the horse comes back to the farm, with four wild horses following in! The Peasant is lucky, and now owns five horses! Neighbors said, "oh how great!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?"  The next day, while trying to break one of the horses, the son is thrown by the horse. He breaks his leg; it won't heal for months. Neighbors said, "oh how sad!" Peasant sez, "how do you know?"  The next day, a great general came to town. He recruited, forcibly, any young man he could find, for a far-off war where most soldiers were going to die. But the son couldn't go; he had a broken leg! Neighbors said, "oh how great!" Peasant sez, "can it!"  Anyone who tells you what is good and what is evil, and judges on that behalf, is lying to you, implying that HIS perspective is the SAME as that of TRUTH, and not simply a subset thereof. Make up your own mind as to what you believe, rather than copypasting the beliefs of others into your brain.   This site is an exploration of alternative social ideas. I hope it makes you think about the ideas that frame your experience.

      In order to become a man of knowledge, one must be a warrior, not a whimpering child. One must strive without giving up, without complaint, without flinching.  One learns to act like a warrior by acting, not talking.  To be a warrior, a man has to be, first of all (and rightfully so) keenly aware of his own death. But to be concerned with death would force any of us to focus on the self, and that would be debilitating. So the next thing one needs, to be a warrior, is detachment. The idea of imminent death, instead of becoming an obsession, becomes an indifference.  Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he is incapable of abandoning himself to anything. Only the idea of death makes a man sufficiently detached so he can't deny himself anything. He knows his death is stalking him and won't give him time to cling to anything, so he tries, without craving, all of everything.  A detached man has only one thing to back himself with - the power of his decision. He has to be the master of his choices. He must fully understand that his choice is his responsibility, and, once he makes it there is no longer time for regrets of recriminations. His decisions ares final, simply because his death does not permit him time to cling to anything.  A warrior does not abandon himself to anything, not even to his death. A warrior is not a willing partner; a warrior is not available, and if he involves himself with something, you can be sure that he is aware of what he is doing. For a warrior, there is nothing out of control. Life, for a warrior, is an exercise in strategy.  The spirit of a warrior is not geared to indulging or complaining, nor is it geared toward winning or losing. The spirit of a warrior is geared only to struggle, and every struggle is a warriors last battle on earth. Thus the outcome matters very little to him. In his last battle on earth, a warrior lets his spirit flow free and clear. And as he wages his battle knowing that he will be impeccable, a warrior laughs and laughs.

      So I'm sorry,  as two hands open doors.  So I'm sorry,  Something serene to steal my life away.   Climbing on the way up,  Sizing up the competition,  waiting for the right time,  To strike a chord and change your life.   Don't you ever think for one-second that  i will forget the reasons that i cried.  You are no more potent than words that choke me  I sit and ask you two words.   But this is not a product,  and we're not in competition,  waiting for the right time,  to strike a chord and your life.   Regret's how i spell your name.  In light of what you have done.  How can you not feel the same?  My love will fade with the sun.  As days go by, shed a tear.  I hate your face more than life.  I'll fake a smile for (you) my dear.  So turn away.   Climbing on the way up,  Sizing up the competition,  Waiting for the right time,  To strike a chord and change your life.

      The tears suspend. Smiles are not more than (empty love) Locked doors can keep you alone Forever paint words (from your lips) in a house that's no longer your home Take the dreams I know (as my own) and it worsens weekends Thanks again for my misery. And you run with fake friends I'm sick of your sad songs and sing alongs. I kind of like it when things are wrong. Straight from left end, They'll shout corrections, And I'll decline, I'll decline A source of comfort or some protection And I'll decline Smiles are not more than (empty love) Locked doors can keep you alone Forever paint words (from your lips) in a house that's no longer your home Take the dreams I know (as my own) and it worsens weekends Thanks again for my misery. And you run with fake friends I'm sick of your sad songs and sing alongs. I kind of like it when things are wrong. Straight from left end, They'll shout corrections, And I'll decline, I'll decline A source of comfort or some protection And I'll decline In your throat You will see Surface relocated Therapy. All I taste of today Is the shame (of) my whore prety All I know are apologies Do you feel the shame?  -From Autumn To Ashes

      And loves light would Led me to you Through all the emptiness that had become my home And love's ice cold Introduced me with you And at that moment I knew I was out of hope   Heal me I begged and love said no Leave me for dead and let me go Kill me I cried and love said no Kill me I cried and love said no  Love's icy tomb Dug open for you Lies in a cemetery that bears my name Love's violent tune From me to you Rips your heart out and leaves you bleeding with a smile on your face  Heal me I begged and love said no Leave me for dead and let me go Kill me I cried and love said no Kill me I cried and love said no  And love said no  And loves light would Took me from you And at that moment I knew I was out of hope   Again  Heal me I begged and love said no Leave me for dead and let me go Kill me I cried and love said no Kill me I cried and love said no  And love said no...  -H.I.M.
