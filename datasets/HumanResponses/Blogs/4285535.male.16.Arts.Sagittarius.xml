       Well...today, i closed down the website. i was pretty much sick and tired of all the people that have lied and haven't supported me.       me and cortney also broke up today. i said some things i shouldn't have, but we got back together. which is very good, because i really really need her by my side.      again, i find myself wondering why certain things happen 2 me. wether it's recording, the website, etc.      ahh..another day in the life of keith fiorino. i have also advertized my journal, and what happens?!? of course...only a couple people respond.       then these fucks I.M. thinkin shits all good. if u dont support me, dont fucking talk 2 me, i dont care who it is. damn. (LoL..."damn" - honey)      well..i am taking a webpage class this school year so hopefully i can get all that together and set up a homepage...and all that..so i know about everything. hopefully i will be able to do that before my 6 months are up on my hosting.       LoL...right now i am terrorizing cortneys friend Whitney. it's quite fun, she is easy to anger. if that even makes sense. she is learning though. she might be able to survive out of her bubble gum world. mission accomplished! wow..my day is getting better now. thank u whit!      shit just aint workin out right now man.   1love

       my honey came home tonight! we picked her up and hung out for about three hours. it was great seeing her beautiful face again, so that made my day.      again, people are really disapointing me with my website that claim to have my back and whatever. now it's down to dave that really has my back, and he prolly always will.      i worked out again today, and have been staying on schedule pretty well(i have my own schedule per day...LoL).      cortney will prolly be gone again for another week, which is terrible, specially since school is starting. i hope to see her and talk to her again as soon as possible.      goodnight

       today was a pretty long day. i haven't heard from my honey for a while. i guess she has no service, or her battery went dead. i got a lot of stuff done though.      the site is still going slow, but dave and justin keep it alive.       erich,will, and a kid i just met named derek(anderson) came over for a while. we went driving. it was pretty freaky and scary(i am sorta a baby). so it was me, derek, erich, will, chris, rich, and zach. donuts, skids, whatever is the new thing to do with cars was going on. we were speeding down some road and outa knowhere a cop zoomed by with his lights going off. we all split up into different sections, and none of us got caught. it was very scary, but at the same time, fun.       we also stopped by derek's girlfriend's(lilly) house. derek wanted to see her, and fight some kid,LoL. we were there for about 5 minutes and then left. my honey comes home tomarrow prolly. i want her to come to me as soon as possible, problem is that my mommy and ted(step dad) might be gone all day:(      my mom also got me a new shirt which was really kewl, it was this weird like wizard surrounded in trees, which is great cuz i usually don't wear stuff like that.       today was not bad, but there is a lot of things i feel i can improve on, or not do.    1-love

       hey yall. today started out pretty good. the day in its self was grand. me, my gurl, and my mommy went shopping. cort(my gurl) did a great job at finding good sales for me, and we got a long great. we didn't actually fight at all the whole day(that is a miracle for me and her). the problem is that she went camping. i prolly wont see her or talk to her for about 3 days. then i guess she's goin' to her uncles for another 5 days..so i might not see or talk to her for 8 days! that's sadening.      i worked out again today for a while, which was good. the site is going extremely slow, and the battles(rap online battles) are not working out at the moment, and im afraid im going to lose a key member(Deathstroke). the only one that seems to post everyday is dave. he's always supported me even if it's in a different way,LoL.       chris..i tried getting on your online journal but it ate me. i would love for you to please stay on the blogger one.      again..no one is doing a homepage for us, about 8 have said they would, and don't do it. im pretty upset with a few people who havn't given me the support i feel like i need/deserve. all in all, i have my honey to support me at the end of the day, I MISS YOU SO MUCH HONEY!       i'm still really bumbed about my whole rapping thing. the recording on a computer did not work out good. and no one else's will work out. so it looks like i gotta save 4,450 dollars some how and get my own studio in my own house. things are not looking good at all lately, except for my parents and baby.       goodnight my people, goodnight.
