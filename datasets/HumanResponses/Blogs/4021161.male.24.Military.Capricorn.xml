      When I play Hold'em, I like to be on the attack at all times.&nbsp; I'm constantly trying to push players out of the pot. However, this sometimes can back fire, as many weak opponents have no concept of pot odds.   They'll cold call 2 big bets with a weak straight draw. Occasionally, they'll hit their weak draw and it will end up winning a large pot. For them, the long run doesn't matter, they are concerned with today only. That's fine with me. I don't mind a player that comes in to a room, and gambles it up! These players are usually just donating money, and they'll lose it all eventually.   It took me a while that for many players, Poker is just a hobby. For most people, their hobbies cost them money. For example, take a guy who likes to go out and play 18 holes of golf one or two times in a week. He buys Clubs, balls, gloves, shoes etc.&nbsp; Then, he pays $30 for greens fees and another $20 for a cart rental. Each time he goes out, he's dropping $50. Doing this 8 times a month costs about $400. Add in at least $100 every month for the balls and random crap every&nbsp;golfer buys. He's looking at $500 a month for a very expensive hobby.   Some of these poker players are just like that golfer. They don't care about bankroll management. They really don't expect to win in the long run. Its just a hobby to them, and if it costs a few hundred bucks for entertainment, then oh well!&nbsp; If they finish up a few hundred bucks in a month they are astonished, and will tell all their buddies how great they are at poker. If they lose a few hundred a month, they aren't surprised. However, they'll publicly blame their failures on other players weak play ( which is pretty much equal to their own ). The rest of the blame falls on good ol' Lady Luck.   How do you deal with a weak passive player when you play an aggressive style of Hold'em? You don't. You keep playing your game. You make sure you're constantly attacking pots. In the long run, you'll dominate.&nbsp; For a serious player, the long run is over the horizon, so don't worry about the results of one session. Appreciate when you have a poor player gambling on weak draws at your table. He's dead money. Eventually, his bankroll will be gone. Unfortunately, you can't guarantee that you'll be on the receiving end of his generosity, but you can make help him in his efforts.

      Jacks...I hate them. There's no amount of way to describe in words how much I hate Jacks.  Why this animosity to the fishhooks?&nbsp;   Imagine this. You are playing some limit poker, and you get AA&nbsp;6 times in a 2-3 hour session. You're excited right?  Well, I was. Except somehow, I managed to lose 5 out of the 6 times I had AA. 4 of those times I lost to a guy with JJ.  Then, I get KK three times, each time it ran into AA.  So, yeah, I'm bitter.  More to follow when I manage to find where 20% of my bank roll went off&nbsp;to.  John

      Today was a great day, then it all came crumbling.&nbsp; The afternoon went really well.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was&nbsp; playing rather solid. After a few hours of 2 tables of $2/$4 open on Poker Stars I was up $225. I am playing much more aggressively of late, as I have read  Small Stakes Hold'em  by Ed Miller et. all. He teaches a dominant aggressive style that is constantly attacking the pot. This can help you really build up a stack of chips, as the afternoon proved.   However, after dinner, I came back to play. I played the same style. I was attacking pots, but I missed almost all of my draws. I also ran into many situations where I was betting the top pair, and players were calling me. They showed no strength (they had none) and they'd spike a 2nd pair on the river. Now, I could go on and on about how they are fish. However, I'm going to be happy about it. As my buddy Steve told me tonight, "Don't tap on the fish tank." They say in Vegas, "Let the Player play." So that's what I'll do. These suckouts (many consecutive) cost me a bit tonight. However, in the long run, I want those players calling with their middle pair and weak kicker. It will build my bank roll. I know that I can raise with overcards and the nut flush draw in late position and I'll take down more than my share of monster pots. So, it didn't happen tonight. Oh well.   So, Right now my bank roll is still pretty healthy, despite the setbacks.&nbsp; I'm sitting at $1664 (I was up to around $1875 give or take.)&nbsp; I did make a blunder tonight. I decided to take a stab at $3/$6. Unfortunately, I had the bad run at a higher limit. I didn't quite have the bank roll for $3/$6, but I'm aggressive with my bank roll. I'll take a stab at a higher limit, but, only for a session or two. I don't play with scared money etc either. I still have more than plenty enough big bets to be comfortable at $2/$4.   I still am planning an extensive review on Small Stakes Hold'em. I'm very impressed thus far. Thanks for reading, although I doubt anyone actually is paying attention to this.

      Thanks for stopping by. Let me welcome you to my poker blog. I guess I should start off by telling you a little background information about myself. My name is John Kopecky. I’m currently an officer in the Air Force and live in Enid, OK. I was well on my way to becoming a pilot in the Air Force. However, I got sick, couldn’t fly for 6 months due to illness. During that time, I reflected a lot and realized that my passion didn’t lie in flying. So, I have decided to be retrained. The Air Force hasn’t decided yet where to send me. I should find out soon, and of course, I’ll keep this page updated when I find out what they want me to do and were they want me to do it.   I started playing poker last summer. I’ll admit it, I’m a member of the Chris Moneymaker clan. I didn’t know what was better, a flush or a straight until July of 2003. But, I’ve made a lot of strides in the last year. I started playing with my buddies last summer, and then decided to try my hand playing online poker last fall. What an idiot I was. I didn’t know a thing about poker (At least I can see that now, back then I thought I was a pro. Don’t we all when we are fish?) Luckily, I didn’t get beat up too bad right away. I actually managed to profit somehow. I did however know that I was a fish, and decided to take a break and buy some poker books. Well, after I read a few books, and realized how dumb I was, I was shocked. How I didn’t lose my shirt right away I don’t know. Since then, I’ve had some ups and downs, but mostly ups.   I’ve played at limits up to $5/$10. I once had my bankroll up to $3800. However, I had one terrible day in April when I couldn’t win a hand to save my life. I had anything that proved Murphy’s Law correct. If it could go wrong, it did. I lost $1300 in one day. I got so angry. I decided to liquidate my remaining bankroll. I paid off my truck, bought a suit, and said I’d never play poker again (You can all stop laughing). About 6 weeks later, Party Poker sent me an email saying they dropped a $100 bonus in my account. I had to play 1000 raked hands before I could cash out the bonus. So, I started playing again on Party Poker. After those 1000 raked hand, my $100 had turned into $250. I kept playing $0.50/$1.00 limit and have built up that $100 to about $1500 currently. Right now, I’m playing $2/$4 limits on Poker Stars. I also have a weekly home game that essentially is a $0.25/$0.50 blind No Limit game.   In this blog, I’m going to keep you readers updated on my poker odyssey. My goal is to get back to the $5/$10 limits, and eventually the coveted $15/$30 limits on Party Poker. I don’t know how long this will take, but I’m hoping that I can get there by the new year. Is this crazy? Who knows. Who thought you could turn $100 into $1500 in 6 weeks of playing less than 10 hours a week? Before I get going too far, I want to give you a couple of links.    urlLink Internet Texas Hold’em  -- This is the site of Matthew Hilger, author of the book, Internet Texas Hold’em. Matthew is an excellent author and player (he placed 33rd at the WSOP this year.) If you are a beginning player, or need a boost in your poker journey, get this book. Its got a ton of information that will help you become a much better player. It also has a great message board with a ton of friendly and exceptionally skilled poker players. Best part of this site, is you can manage to get a copy of his book for free.    urlLink Empire Poker  - A great site to play. It shares all the same ring game tables as Party Poker. However, it has smaller tourneys. I don’t know about you, but I like smaller tourneys. I don’t like to play against 1000 players all the time. If you sign up through this link, you’ll get a 20% deposit bonus, up to $100.   That's it for this update. I'll try to update this at least 2 or 3 times a week. I just got a new book, Small Stakes Hold'em, by Ed Miller, David Sklansky and Mason Malmuth (poker author powerhouses to say the least) available from Two Plus Two publishing. I hope to have a full review up after I'm done reading. Even a few of the tips I've picked up in the first half of the book have helped me win a few big pots that have more than paid for the book already. A great book so far!

      Today I read an article by ESPN Page 2's Jay Lovinger ( urlLink Find article here ). He listed his favorite poker books. I liked a lot of his suggestions. I haven't read them all.  I figured I'd list my favorite Poker Books I've read this far. In no particular order.      Small Stakes Hold'em , by Ed Miller. This book is designed to teach you how to crush weak and loose poker games. Its definitely not a book for a beginning player. I'd suggest you read a few other poker books geared towards beginners. Make sure you are a winning player while playing their conservative style. Once you've got experience and are ready to try to transform your game, you should try this book. I've only got about a month under my belt after reading this book. I'll be honest, a lot of the suggestions go against conventional wisdom and might make you uncomfortable. You'll be raising very frequently. However, the opportunity to crush a small stakes game is readily apparent in the pages of this text.    Internet Texas Hold'em  ,  by Matthew Hilger. This book is a must have for the beginning player, whether you're playing in a Brick and Mortar Casino, or an online poker room. Hilgers text is deceptively advanced. He has the ability to teach the basics. Yet, a follow on read of the text reveals more advanced layers of poker strategy that will help out even an advanced player. The title is misleading, as the book can help out any poker player. However, it has a few chapters that help deal with some of the differences in the world of online poker. You can visit Matthew's website and get a free copy of his book by going  urlLink here . If you try to get a free copy of the book, make sure to let Matthew know I referred you.   The Theory of Poker , by David Sklansky. I make fun of David Sklansky's books a lot. However, they are great books. The only thing that is bad about his books is the writing style. They are boring, and a lot of times get into details of statistics that would put a speed addict to sleep. However, having an understanding of the advanced topics put forth by Sklansky in this text is a must for any serious poker player. If you can get through the dry writing, you'll be well on your way to beating any game you play.   Play Poker Like the Pros , by Phil Hellmuth. Now, before you say it, I can't stand Phil's whining at every bad beat either. Now, we have that out of the way. This book is a great resource for a novice player. What I like about it is that it has good information for the Hold'em player that is looking to branch out into Omaha and Stud. Phil teaches the basics for these games and others. He does brag about himself a bit too.   Caro's Book of Poker Tells , by "Mad" Mike Caro. Lets face it, Mike Caro is one of the most eccentric characters in professional poker. But, he's a master at the game(s). In this book, Mike deals with poker 'tells.' Now, if you've been handcuffed to a chair and forced to watch Celebrity Poker Showdown, you hear Phil Gordon ramble on about tells the entire show. Well, Phil learned everything he knows about tells from this book. You'll learn what it means when a player exhibits a certain mannerism. You'll also learn how to use tells to trap your opponents. If you're serious about poker, and want to take advantage of your opponents, this is the book for you. (Note, this won't work in Online games, if that wasn't obvious to you before reading this, you're an idiot.)   Zen and the Art of Poker , by Larry Phillips. I already wrote about this book in detail last week. This book is a great read. Especially if you are like me, and easily annoyed at your opponents poor play. Read this book, you'll learn how to deal with the emotional roller coaster that poker can become. It'll help you remain focused and calm.   Well, that's it for my list for now. I've read more books, but many I find aren't a great help in the long run. If you have any questions, let me know in the comments.  John

      I'm in the market for an MP3 player. I've been looking online and knew I wanted an MP3 player with at least 20 GB of storage space.  Well, I live in a small town. Only 58,000 people. We've got a Wal-Mart, and a small shopping mall. I looked at Wal-Mart's website and found plenty of decent models to choose from. Now, they didn't have any models with large hard drives in the store. So, I decided to check out Sears. The store had several models to choose from. They were held in a permanent display case and were not able to be removed. I asked the salesman if I could somehow take a look at one.  He obviously was new, so he said he'll get me some more help. Soon, some fat guy comes over and asks if I need help. I tell him that I was hoping to look at their most expensive models of MP3 players. He asks me, "What would you like to know about them?" I replied, "Well, I want to know the weight, storage capability, whether they come with software, car kits...yadda yadda yadda." He looks at me like I asked him to recite the preamble to the Constitution. He knew nothing about them. I then said, "lets make this easy, can I look at the $300 and the $280 models?" To me, that seemed like a simple question.  "I can't show you them."  W?  T?  F?  "What do you mean? I just want to see the box. Since you can't answer a question, I was hoping to look at the box to find out the information I need."  "I can't get you a non-display unit until you purchase the item."  "OK...Good bye"  He makes no effort to try to appease me or get the sale. I go straight to the customer service desk and I am pissed. I ask to speak to a manager. This annoying woman comes out and makes a zillion excuses for him. "The electronics department is going under remodeling...We can't open the box if you aren't purchasing the item [not what I requested, but oh well]...No other store would treat you any differently."  I tell her that I couldn't believe how poor the customer service I received is. How hard is it to go to the back of the store and get two boxes so I can look and see what the items include????  Anyway, she asks me if I'd like to accompany her to the electronics department and we could discuss this with the salespeople there.  I told her this, "There's no way I'm purchasing it from your store. I don't care if you gave it to me for free, I wouldn't take it. I'd like to say I'll never be back to Sears again, but that's a lie since I'm addicted to Craftsman tools."  Anyway, please excuse my rambling.  9 days till I go back to Vegas. Am I counting??? No. Not me.  John

      So, I've been playing for the last few weeks, and I've been trying to increase my bankroll. I keep a lot of my bankroll off of any individual poker site. Mostly it is in my bank account, cash, or Neteller. However, every time I would break the $1000 barrier online, I'd quickly go on a losing streak and be down around $750-$800. This happened 4 times in 3 weeks. So, this past week, I told myself I wouldn't let it happen again. I decided to play some $20 Sit-'n-Go tourneys. I did pretty well, only managed to win one, but had plenty of second and third place finishes. Before I knew it, I was more than above my bankroll's glass ceiling. So, lets hope this sticks.  I recently read a post online that kind of bothered me. A guy was asking for advice on how to play in a casino for the first time. A gentleman replied that he shouldn't raise too much before the flop since everyone sees the flop with any two cards and will likely make 2 pair to beat your top pair top kicker, or big pair. I couldn't disagree with this more. In a loose game, you need to be raising these hands out, or at least make these chumps put in more 'dead money.' You can't play poker with the defeatist attitude that you're not going to play aggressively because you know a bad beat is going to happen. If you play this way, there is no way you can make a serious long term profit. You're constantly playing with the attitude that something is going to go wrong. You have to be accepting of bad beats, don't get angry. However, you also have to play your cards the best way possible, and that is to make weaker hands pay more to play. Would you not bet your top set if the board was two-suited because a flush might hit? No, that would be insane. The same goes with not raising pre-flop with AK or QQ because people play any Ace or Any King.  So, if you go to play in a casino, don't be a wuss. Raise when you should raise, and if you're in doubt, re-raise. :)  Also, I have no idea if anyone ever reads anything I write. I know one person has, but other than that, have no clue. So, I'd appreciate a comment now and then. Just a 'hey idiot, you suck' would even work.  John

      So, I read a great book this week. I ordered  Zen and The Art of Poker  by Larry W. Phillips.  It seems a bit of an oxymoron. How can Zen thinking apply to Poker? Especially since I'm a Christian, not a Buddhist. Don't worry, you don't have to head to the Casino in an orange robe and hand out flyers between hands. The book is more about the state of mind you need to be a successful poker player.  A lot of topics covered in the book were things I intuitively knew. Now, this doesn't mean that the book is useless. In fact, it helped me focus on things I need to be doing better to improve my game.  I frequently get angered when I lose hands on the river when I had a substantial advantage. Why??? Why do I, as a online player that has likely played 40,000+ hands of poker in the last year act surprised when a player sucks out on me? Why don't I act surprised when I make a solid draw against another players strong hand? I've seen it happen countless times. I should almost expect it.  This is a big part of the book. The author helps your realize that you can't play solid poker if you let your emotions get in the way of your success. So what if you lose a pot here and there. You'll win many pots, and you'll lose many pots as well. Accept the failure, and many times, you have to realize that it wasn't even a failure. One of the best analogies in the book related poker to tennis. Imagine if you played Tennis, but that the ball had a mind of its own. It could dart left or right or do whatever it wanted at any moment. Essentially, this is poker. The best players can try their best to manage the ball, but in the end, the ball (cards or luck) has a mind of its own. You just have to go with the flow.  So, the last few days I've been playing with a different attitude. Amazingly, I've been less emotional when a player makes a miracle flush after calling 3 bets with 7-5 suited. I've seen worse, I'll see worse. I just have to play the next hand.   Now, lets get back to that number I put up before. I've played over 40,000 hands online in the last 10 months. Think of how much experience you can get playing online recreational.  Lets relate this to casino play. A good dealer can get in maybe 30-35 hands an hour. We'll use 32 an hour as a base for this calculation. So, in the last 10 months I've received the equivalent of 1250 hours of casino poker time. That's 52 days (24 hours a day) Or, 156 days of playing 8 hours a day. Now, I don't nearly play that much time per day. But, online you can play 2-3 tables a time, and the computer dealer can crank out 60-70 hands an hour or more.  Its no surprise to me that internet players are taking over the poker world. They can get more experience in a shorter time, they play faster, and rely more on odds and probabilities then tells and feeling.

      So, this past week has been rather boring. I've logged plenty of hours playing $2/$4 on both Poker Stars and Party Poker. What do I have to show for it? Not much. I haven't made any money in the last week, but I haven't lost any money either. I've won some huge pots , and a lost a few huge pots. However, after 20-25 hours of play, I'm literally within $10 of where I was last week.  I guess this is good. I've been playing solidly. I do have to say that I'm glad to be back playing on Party Poker. The players at Party and Empire are so loose. On Poker Stars, you'll average 4-5 players seeing the flop on a loose table. You can easily find tables on Party Poker where 6-7 players will see the flop on a regular basis.  I love when you have that many players seeing the flop. I know that if I have a solid hand, I'm at a huge advantage. Lets say 6 players see the flop. In a theoretical perfect situation, each player would have a 5 to 1 chance of winning the hand, or about 16.8%. Now, that means if I have an above average hand, and have a 25% chance of winning the hand, I'm in a profitable situation. You have to remember, Poker is a zero sum game. That is, for every dollar player x wins, another player has to lose. So, if I have a 25% chance of winning a pot, some player has to have a 10% chance. If that player with the 10% chance puts in chips, he's losing money in the long run. Now, if the flop comes, and I have a solid flush draw, and there are 6 players on the flop, I have a 30% or so chance of taking the pot. This means that there a few players drawing dead. If any of them call, they're just donating money to the pot.  So, that's why I prefer to play on Party Poker. Why play against solid players on Poker Stars all day, when you can play against idiots over on Party Poker?  Sorry about my rambling, I'll try to gather my thoughts.  A hand that bothered me yesterday. I had AA on the button. The pot was raised before it got to me, a couple players cold call, I make it 3 bets, the big blind calls, the original raiser caps the betting and I'm the last player to call. Its such a sick feeling when you have AA and 5 other players are seeing the flop for full price. You realize you're likely going to a showdown no matter what, but your chances of winning are minimized.  Well, I lost Aces full of twos to a guy with Quad twos. He made the last two on the river. (The pot was 25 Big Bets) I love this game.
