      Gloria is the headmistress of the School of Double-Talking for the Gullible and Wretched Hobbits of the Lower Earth (apologies to Tolkien fans for the allusion).   Come to think of it, whether she steps down or not in 2007, it would still be a win-win situation for her. That is, to go down in history as the ONE who  bound us all to the Mt. of Doom for the longest time ever, if not forever. Consider this:   Scenario 1: Gloria steps down as President in 2007 as a result of the shift to a parliamentary system.    That was her campaign promise last May, and this time, she is keeping her word. Rumors would have it that through The Cardinal's divine intervention, the Holy Yellow Ghoul appeared before her, cleansed her heart and changed her mind. Hallelujah!    But no, don't bring out the champagne yet. As Yoda-venecia has started to peddle around, we may still have her as the transitional Prime Minister from 2007-2010! Why not? That is rational and practical, if not in fact necessary, lest we face a leadership vacuum (from which we have been suffering since the 1960s anyway). Besides, the GMA camp would again try to go around selling the idea that it's better to have a Gloria than a Yoda-venecia for a Prime Minister. What we need, after all, is a US-educated economist who can reach out to the poor either by brute force or by dancing/singing/acting on TV ala-Nora Aunor. That's what a strong republic is all about, isn't it? So there again, it would be a battle between the lesser evil and the Yoda. Who won't buy that crap? Not me, but certainly the Makati Business Club would.    Scenario 2: Gloria clings on to her presidency till 2010.    What's wrong with that? She was given a clear 6-year mandate by the people, especially the Cebuanos (if indeed they really delivered that historically improbable 1 million++ votes). That's something we can't just sweep under the rag. For chrissakes, that's the rule of law, it's in the Constitution! We are a strong law-abiding republic, aren't we? Besides, who gives a hoot about campaign promises anyway? In the Grand Ethics of  Politics, promises are a fart. Pffft. So whether we like it or not, Glory-ous days are here to stay till, well, 2010. At least.    Scenario 3: Gloria forever: 2010 and beyond   But Gloria's thirst for power will not end with her term in 2010 either as a Prime Minister or President of the land. I bet my bottom dollar that by 2010, she would again seek a clear mandate from the people, this time as a prime minister. Well, why not? She was never a prime minister before. In scenario 1, she was just a transitional prime minister from 2007-2010. In scenario 2, dammit, do you spell President as p-r-i-m-e-m-i-n-i-s-t-e-r? In short, the great Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo would be perfectly, constitutionally eligible to be the country's prime minister in 2010!  She's got experience to boot; she has already mastered the art of systematically pillaging this country into pieces.  Can anyone contest that?  Bagging the ministership is actually an easy task. She simply needs to run for a representative post possibly in Pampanga or better yet, in Cebu (if we are to believe the Comelec). Then from there, it would be a piece of cake -- she could literally buy her way to get the votes of her fellow-reprentatives to give her the highest seat, that being the Prime Minister.    With the current state of things (3-year term for Congressmen), a Rep. Gloria could easily get herself elected by her peers to be the Prime Minister in 2010. And assuming that Congress would keep the 3-term limit per congressman (it is very unlikely that they would limit themselves to 1 term just to get rid of Gloria), we are talking here of 9 long years of Gloria leading us to the dogs! Now, that is exciting.  Then what? By 2019, our trapos garbed as political pundits would realize that the Parliament isn't any good for us so we pack our democratic bags again and revert to the good old American presidential system. Hopefully by then, Gloria would already be too old and demented to gun for any public office there is in our god-forsaken shire.  But then again, there would be Mikey.

      This may be a bit unfitting, if not totally scatological, for a first blog. So before anything, my apologies to those who are in the business of eating at this very moment.  Gomen ne.    But indulge me as I have to do this, lest I let go of my writing fancies forever. You see, I have not really written anything for more than three years now. Not a single poem nor essay of personal significance. One of my poems which saw the light of day in a Japan-based Pinoy daily recently was actually an old one, dating back to 1999. For chrissakes, that was still part of the 20th century! Call it the writer's block, but I am hardly a writer myself. I just used to write whenever I felt like it, no big I-have-these-squirting-ideas-inside-my-freaking-head deal. Or if this is indeed THE block, certainly it does not take this long, does it? My affliction, I suspect, is actually worse -- I think I've completely lost IT. My affair with the Muse has gone fishing forever to the river of no return. Kaput.  Or so I thought. Until now.   My salvation? A twenty-minute exhilirating defecation experience.   It all started when Pilar, the wifey, left the AC on all night because she felt like the scorching Tokyo summer heat has taken over her. I retired half-naked (don't ask why) so naturally, in a matter of few hours, I was beginning to feel this funny uneasiness in my insides. Sleepy-me tried not to mind it at first by twitching here and there, playing dead like a log, which worked for about two hours or so until alas! I couldn't hold it off any longer.  I rushed to the bathroom half-awake and half-flying at exactly 4:50 a.m., and came out, my mind fully-awake and wandering, at 5:10 a.m. While inside, they -- my you-know-what -- first came out really hard and slow as if my whole three-square-meter toilet world was in an excruciating slow-mo. For a moment, I thought Aristotle and Ptolemy might have been right in saying that the earth is immovable and the rest of the solar system, including the sun, simply revolve around us. The world in an stationary state, time in suspension. But then, just as I was about to lose my mind, they -- my you-know-what -- started flowing out like the great Ganges currents flooding the toilet bowl with little yellow armies of relief.   I discharged so much that it took me quite a while to recover. "Ano'ng nangyari sa'yo?" I remembered the wifey asking later. It was an extraordinary, exhausting ordeal that nonetheless felt great in the end. I tried to force myself back to sleep, again twitching here and there, but to no avail. Then suddenly in the middle of everything, while Japan's sun-god was slowly beginning to rise, it happened: I felt like writing again! Hallelujah! It was like an Apparition or something, and no sooner did I find myself typing my way to my first blog entry. Hence, this.  I once told the wifey that peeing is life's greatest pleasure that you can do by your lonesome. Now I stand corrected: It's defecating, from which I owe this li'l piece of, well, shit.

      Mahal,  Kayganda pala ng iyong kagubatan, ibang-iba du'n sa dati kong napasyalan na halos makalbo na dahil sa walang patumanggang  quarrying.  Itong sa iyo, aba, naglalalim-lunti ang paligid; wari'y sinasapo ng mga hamog sa dahon pati patak ng araw. Naisip ko tuloy, ang lilim na nakahandusay sa makipot na daan ay pangako bang di ako dadapuan ng anumang nakakamatay na kanser sa laman?  Mabuti na lang at di mo tinanggihan itong paanyayang dalawin natin yaring pinagkaingat-ingatan mong lihim.  Hamo't susuklian ko ang iyong  kagandahang loob :  Sa aking pagbabalik, mag-iiwan ako ng punlang lubos mong ikagagalak at itatanim ko ito sa pinakapusod ng iyong gubat.
