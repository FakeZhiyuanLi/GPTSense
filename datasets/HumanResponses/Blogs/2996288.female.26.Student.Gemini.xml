						   Anyone who lives inside my head knows that I hate car commercials.  I think they are completely boring and pointless and irritating and all those other bad things.  Some commercials are great.  Usually, they are not for cars.  Occasionally, there is a commercial that you really sit and watch.  Lately, these have been showing up online.  The latest big new one is  urlLink Seinfeld and Superman  for American Express.  Pretty clever.  I'm not encouraging anyone to go get an American Express card, but I AM encouraging everyone to memorize the Sing-a-long song.  That way you can all sing with me!!!  Oh, yes Wyoming!

						   I find it hard to be concerned with taking this test, when there is stuff like  urlLink this  going on in the world.  I just don't understand.

						   Let's get this freaking thing over with!  Y'all are invited to a party at my house on Friday night.  Come on over, it will be great much fun.  I can't wait!!!!!!!  What happened today?  Well, I watched a lot of television.  Apparently, somewhere on the medical liscencing (I can NEVER spell that word right...) exam, there will be a section on  urlLink Trading Spaces  because I've been watching an awful lot of that.  I betcha I get a 100% in the "Paint" section.  Yeah, right.  Well.  I'm hungry.  Again and always.  I want cake, and I'm gonna eat it!!!!!

						   I think I can remember every word I've spoken out loud today.  As long as you don't count the random mumbling I do to myself as I do practice test questions - who knows what I say at those times!  It really is amazing how isolated one can be - even while out doing things.  I had breakfast at Panera, coffee at Starbucks, went to the Y for yoga, and then to Qdoba for dinner.  Beyond placing my orders and saying 'namaste' at the end of yoga - I don't think I've said ANYthing else.  If you've never met me, you wouldn't realize what a large statement this is.  I talk.  I talk a lot.  In my sleep, during movies, during church, at the dentist...  I'm just amazed that I could and did make it through a day without saying many words.    I've actually thought it would be a fun challenge for myself - to see if I could go a whole day without talking.  I never thought I could, but I've got a renewed faith in myself now.  Down with talking!!!  I always used to challenge myself to do things when I was a kid.  I'd decide to be blind and go everywhere in the house with my eyes closed.  Another of my favorites was to pretend I didn't have knees.  (I'm really quite adept at getting up and down stairs without bending my knees as a result!)  Or I would sing everything, and it would have to rhyme.  Odd behavior?  Perhaps.  Fun?  Definitely.  I recommend that you all try it: close your eyes and straighten those legs and go have fun!

						   ...really annoy me.  My brain is moving much to fast to sit and wait for the computer to catch up.  Though... it is just the Kaplan web site that is being slow.  Maybe that just means I should be done studying for the day.  That's actually not a bad idea, now that I think of it.  I need to get up early and hit it all again.  Today was a good study day (I even raised my overall average to 61%!!!!).  I hope the next three days will be as well - then that is it!  I'm done!  I can't wait.  Of course, now that this is coming to an end, all that other junk is resurfacing in my mind.  Maybe it is just hormones.  I miss my friends.  That's all.  Though I must say, I've had the opportunity to spend more time with several people that I've neglected in the past.  It has been very nice.  People are so cool.  I wish that could be my job: hanging out with people.  That would be ideal.  I only get hungry at night.  I barely eat during the day any more, but hit 10 or 11 pm, and I'm liable to eat... anything, really.  Mmm.  Don't brownies sound good?

						   I am always trying to predict the future.  The Magic 8 ball is just one of my methods.  I like playing with Tarot cards, and other random 'future-telling' gadgets.  I don't ever actually believe any of it, but that doesn't make me stop.  Why the fascination?  Why try to hurry everything along?  I'm just impatient, I guess - I want to know what's next right now!  It's all very exciting.  But I think I'm glad that the 8 ball isn't always right, after all.  In other news: my parents purchased a new house.  I knew this was coming - that didn't even take the Tarot cards.  They've been looking at houses, and talking about this for a long time now.  My baby sister is about to graduate from high school, and my mom is dreading the empty nest.  My dad is just a gypsy at heart, I think (like me) and gets bored of the same place.  I'm intrigued to see what my parents have gotten themselves into.  It is a 'fixer-upper.'  And not of the "Money Pit really-nice-but-falling-apart-watch-out-for-the-hole-in-the-floor" variety.  It's more of the "Sling Blade bury-your-dead-baby-brother-in-the-backyard-shed" variety.  According to my sisters anyway.  Actually, it doesn't sound bad as all that...quite.  I'll be home in April and I'll get to see the new house.  It comes with a farmer.    I've never owned a farmer before.  I don't even think that my Fisher Price barn had one, although I may have been too hypnotically attracted to the mooing sound the barn door made when you opened it to ever notice presence or lack of Farmer.   I suppose technically, we don't actually OWN this farmer - just the land that he farms.  Maybe it is a she?  I wonder if the feminist movement reached the farming industry.  There are so many important things to do right now, but they just don't interest me.  I need a Magic 8 ball and a Fisher Price barn... that'd be fun...

						   When you apply the medical school, the big question is: Why?  Why do you want to be a doctor?  Why this school?  Why should we accept you?  I often had the hardest time with that first one - why did I want to be a doctor?  Why do I?  During that application time, everyone comes up with their own unique way of saying "I want to help people" without coming right out and saying that.  We don't want to be trite, after all.    Getting into my school was one of the most exciting things that has ever happened to me.  It took me three years of applications, essays and interviews to find the right way to say "I want to help people."  And after all that time of professing that belief, I really believed it myself.  The first few weeks of school, I was fired up.  I was not learning anatomy for my own good - it was for 'my patients.'  I spent hours learning blood supply to the GI tract, because some day, I'd use that information to help 'my patients.'  It was exciting, and inspirational, and really hard to keep up.  It was not long before I realized there was no way to learn the vast amount of information being thrown haphazardly at us.  I went from studying for 'my patients' to studying to survive.  I was swimming in this vast ocean of facts, and it was really hard to keep my head above water.  And it just kept getting worse: no land in sight.  Eventually, I got used to the sensation of almost drowning almost constantly, and started to look around me, at my classmates - my fellow oceanic swimmers.  What an amazing group.  I cannot imagine a more intimidating collection of people, than a medical school class.  Everyone in it has worked hard.  Very hard.  For a long, long time.  No one in it is used to losing, or even to showing any weakness.  We may all be slowly drowning, but very few will ask for a life jacket.  So everyone tries to play it off like they are okay.  Like they are equipped with webbed feet and gills (not intended to be a reference to Waterworld, but whatcha gonna do?), and can swim forever.  Groups of us come together, and come to depend on one another to survive.  There really is no other way  We've finished our academic portion of med school now, and are studying to take a really big test.  I feel like I finally made it to an island in this ocean, and am finally able to get my bearings.  Finally.  There is a different perspective from here.  I can see where I came from, and I can see what I've lost on my journey.  I had lost the passion for 'my patients' -- my why.  I had also lost my own sense of identity - sans webs, sans gills, sans survival group.  I am glad to be here. I feel calm, and I'm learning new things.  And, all of a sudden, I've found my why.  There was a sunset the other night and the sky actually looked like mother of pearl.  It was amazing.  Last week, I went home for lunch, and heard nearby churches' bells, and just stood in my parking lot listening.  A few days ago, I saw a brother and sister playing...  This is my why.  I want to help people, yes, but this is _what_ I want to help them do: to enjoy sunsets, to be able to stop and stand and to be at peace, to be able to play - freely, without pain, without worry.  There have been many times when I doubted myself, and doubted my desire to be a doctor.  I felt I made everything up just to get into medical school, and that it was all a sham.  It is nice to have my why again.  Because there is a lot more ocean left out there, and I doubt I'll remember to ask for that life jacket.

						   I just realized that everything I'm wearing today is blue.  I dind't plan on that.  They say that your favorite color is whatever you have the most of in your wardrobe.  For me, I guess that is blue.  But, really, I want to be a person who had red as a favorite color.  Time to go shopping!  Or not.  The girl who is about to ask her parents for several thousand dollars to survive until her next loan disbursement comes in (late August) cannot afford to go buy clothes.  Or to eat, really...!  At least studying is free.  And in great abundance!

						   ...life does go on, though not always the way one imagines it will.  For perhaps the first time in my life, I'm taking a stand.  I am not going to apologize.  I do feel the incredible urge to try to smoothe everything over with my... friends.  I still want to call them friends, so I will.  That may change.  I've decided that I don't need to apologize, though.  If there is an apology due, I say it is to me.  Not for the things that were said, but for the manner in which it was handled.  There was no reason to yell.  There was no reason for it to be two against one, with no even semi-impartial person there.  That was not fair to me, so I am not going to be the one to apologize.  If this makes no sense, read my last entry.  :)  Other than obsessing, and trying hard to remain firm in my decisions, I'm trying desperately to study.  I am in medical school, and I do have one of the most important tests of my life coming up in less than two weeks.  This should be the most important thing to me right now.  Unfortunately, I am ruled a lot more by emotion, and personal interactions than by my desire to succeed professionally.  This may be my downfall some day.  Or, who knows?  It could be a good quality for a physician to have.  I just wish I could turn it off for now!  I Want a Famous Face.  MTV.  Are these people for real???

						   I have never really been in a 'relationship.'  There are many reasons for this, which I won't be going into today.  Suffice it to say, I have not suffered a break-up since I was 16.  I've 'dated' people, but I've always been the one to end things.  And, as bad as this may sound: it did not hurt.  I felt guilt, but not the emptiness that comes along with being dumped.  Last night, I was dumped.  By my friends.  I didn't even know that it was possible to do such a thing.  But after sitting in a grocery store parking lot at 3 in the morning getting yelled at... I see that it is possible.  These words were spoken: "why did you come, if it was obvious that you weren't welcome."  There were other words, too, but I'll keep those.    I'm 25 years old.  Do people actually do these things?  I feel as if I'm in a dream - a nightmare - and I'm desperately trying to wake myself up.  Funny thing is, I had a bad dream a few weeks ago: I was at a grocery store, and ran into these (and other) friends.  They were all mad at me, and were mean.  I don't remember exactly what happened, but I woke up feeling awful.  Was someone trying to warn me?  To stay away from grocery stores, anyway?  I'm not sure what to do next.  If I do try to patch things up, they may yell at me again, and they will not believe me.  That was made clear.  If I don't try to patch things up, I am making life harder for everyone else.  People who do not deserve to be dragged into this.  I am not blameless here.  I've often behaved poorly, but I've never set out to hurt anyone.  I feel awful that it has turned out that way.  Intentionally or not, I've obviously hurt people enough to cause this scene.  I had been been trying to make things better, too, which is the funny thing.  I've been trying to take a step back, because I realize that I've been angering people.  But taking a step back seems to have caused even more anger.  I've been trying to watch out for everyone, and am accused of only looking out for myself.  I guess it is time to switch gears, and really do what I'm accused of.    I guess this is good for me.  No one should live life without being dumped on occasion.  It must make you stronger in some way.  Some day I'll figure it out.  Until then, I'm allowed to shed copious tears for the loss of not one, but two relationships.

						   I just cut all my hair off!  It went from here to here.  :)  It was about half-way down my back, now it is at my chin.  I always enjoy the big hair cuts.  I think that's the only reason I bother growing my hair out - just to experience the novelty of such weightlessness on my head.  It just barely gets into a ponytail.  Kind of.  More like an exploding ponytail.  It's Friday, and I slept in, and got a haircut, and went to the gym... Now I need to study.  There are movies to be seen, and parties to attend, but not by me tonight.  Maybe I'll have my very own Blockbuster night, though...

						   After I dragged (drug?) myself out of the pit of watching Survivor (I watched the first two seasons religiously), I thought I had eradicated the RTVV.  That's the "Reality Television Virus."  It is quite catching.  I had hoped that, like chicken pox, you could only get it once.  It turns out that, like chicken pox, it really just moves into a latent phase, waiting to strike again when you least expect it.  Unlike chicken pox, it doesn't lead to a painful skin lesion following the path of a dermatome (shingles).  It just leads you to watch ALL reality TV shows imaginable.  Here's my list:  urlLink American Idol ,  urlLink The Apprentice ,  urlLink Top Model ,  urlLink Forever Eden ,  urlLink Playing it Straight .  And now there is one coming out called  urlLink The Swan. .  Personally, I think it is an absolutely AWFUL premise, yet I feel drawn to it.  I blame RTVV.  American Idol was amazing last night.  I really like John Peter Lewis.  There is no reason, other than the fact that he is just having fun.  I get the feeling that he decided to audition as some joke, and the fact that he's made it this far totally amazes him.  Granted, the fact that he flew to Hawaii to audition, which probably means that he invested more than a passing thought in the competition.  But, doesn't he seemed amazed to have made it this far?  Humble, anyway.  That said, the guy has no chance of winning.  Not that I can see.   urlLink My favorite idol website .  Go Fantasia!  I missed Top Model, but I see April was kicked off.  Huh.  I thought she'd win.  Looks like Shandi's got it.  I must get started.  It is after 1, and I have yet to open a book today.   urlLink Le sigh...

						   I made it to the 60% mark...  Supposedly you only need to score in the 65-70% range to pass the boards.  I have three more weeks to get there.  Let me give you fair warning: I've only scored a 46% in pharmacology.  Do NOT let me prescribe any medications to you.  But if you want a diagnosis, I'll be your girl.  Well, at least 60% of the time.  The Practice is on tonight.  I always hated the show, but got hooked on it last year because my friends always watched it.  Now, they don't watch it as much, but I do.  Something seems wrong with that.  HA!  I've just fallen out of the weekly Sunday anti-social mode.  Time to find people to annoy.  Another of my specialties....

						   So, this blogging thing.  I still don't really know what I'm doing...  (Or why.)  But I feel that I must learn how to do this soon...  I have a great fear of being one of those 85 year old ladies attending "Create Your Own Blog" course in the nursing home, and just NOT getting it, thus instilling an abiding fear in the poor little high school kid about ever growing old, so much so that they get terrified of doing ANYthing, and they end up living at home with their parents until they are 45, and then they go rob a liquor store just do do SOMEthing different, and then they get shot by the over-zealous store owner with his brand new semi-automatic, and then no one will come to the funeral because they lost all their friends while they were holed up in their parent's basement trying to avoid growing old.  I can't be responsible for that!  So, I am learning now.  I've got a good 60 years to get it down, before I'm that 85-year old woman, so hopefully that will be enough time.  I stayed up until five watching a made-for-TV movie about a high school lesbian.  I really don't know why.  I'm: a) not in high school; b) not a lesbian; and c) tired as a result of the late night.  Someone should take away my TV.  Does anyone else specialize in epiphanies like I do?  I have lots of epiphanies.  Trouble is, I never seem to follow through on them...  Oh, well.  Today's epiphany: if I am uncomfortable in a situation - I can leave!  Now, this may not seem earth-shattering, and I probably would have spouted some such inspirational jibber-jabber to friends at any given time in the past.  But today it feels true. I believe it!  Thus the epiphany.  We'll see if tomorrow brings any more.  Back to studying...  I'm averaging a 59% on Kaplan Q-Bank for my boards studies.  My goal is to bump that up to a 60% today, however transiently.  Wish me luck!

						   It snowed last week.  But now that it is approaching 'spring' here in lovely North Carolina, the AC is on and I'm freezing.  I used to have warm hands all the time, but I've apparently gotten nicer as I've aged, because now my hands are always cold.  You know: cold hands, warm heart.  Yeah, right.  Cold hands, cranky me.  It is Saturday night, and I'm off to go... study.  Yes, that's right folks.  Study.  Welcome to the exciting topsy-turvy world of the medical student.  I feel the need to take out a PSA aimed at all the poor saps vying desperately to gain admittance to medical school.   :::Picture: Me.  Studying, with the calendar clearly showing that it is Saturday.::: TITLE: How much do you really want to 'help people?'  Something along those lines, anyway.  I'd come up with something better, but my hands are too cold.  Caffeine makes me think better, and it dilates blood vessels (because it is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor - just like Viagra!), so I'm gonna go get some and hope that my hands warm up.  Warm hands, happy me.

						   Wow.  I just finished my first day of third year of med school - my first day as a "pretend doctor," if you will.  My feet hurt a bit too much to really write about it, but these are the basic impressions:  I have NO idea what I'm doing; interns and residents are fabulously nice and helpful; I have NO idea what I'm doing and finally - I think this is going to be fun!  If only I knew what I was doing...  :)  I'm in CCU.  That's Coronary Care Unit.  I think.  Maybe it is Cardiology Care Unit.  See: I don't know anything!  But, I made it through the day (it went by really fast!) and I'm still smiling.  Yee-haw!  We'll see how I'm feeling Wednesday night, after my first night on call...  I left my poor partner in crime (who  is  now talking to me, after an emotional - on my side anyway - hour-long talk last night; 1 of 3 so far...I don't know if I'll be able to convert the others) behind for his first night of call.  I felt almost like I was abandoning him.  He didn't have a patient yet, so was quite bored.  I had had one patient, and was clueless.  I'm hoping that by the end of the week, we'll be done with boredom and cluelessness...  It is raining outside, which is wonderful.  There'd been just a bit too much sun lately.  I miss me some gloomy days.  Have I mentioned that I'm from Oregon?  Maybe I need to invest in some sort of foot-soaking thing-a-ma-bob...  Hmmm...that sounds nice.

						   Oh. My. Gosh.  Tomorrow is the big day.  I'm a bit (a LOT) nervous.  Sometimes I'm excited, too, but mostly, I'm just nervous.  Now.  The dean's meeting.  I had asked one of the girls what the meeting was going to be about, because I had  no  clue, and I didn't want to be completely taken off guard.  She just told me that it wasn't about personal issues, that they just wanted to make sure we'd be able to work together...  I accepted that and didn't question it further.  So, when the meeting started, I was surprised to find out that there was something more specific.  Apparently, there was an e-mail sent to the two girls about a week after the initial incident.  I don't know what was in the e-mail - no one will show it to me - but it was taken as a threat against their grades.  A threat that I somehow initiated, or had some hand in.  This same friend has offered several times to intervene, and I've told her no.  This is my issue, and I'd never ask anyone else to get involved.  It's painful enough for me, I don't want to muddle it up with other people.  Because then stuff like this happens...  Sigh.  So all the anger this last week has had a source: this e-mail.  I feel like there is this war raging around me, and I am five steps behind on the battlefield, searching for clues among the rubble.    I'm still not angry.  I'm confused.  I'm so terribly confused.  I so desperately want to understand why this is all happening, but no one will tell me anything.  And then they don't believe that I don't know anything!  Why would I lie?  What on earth would that accomplish?  I do not lie.  I've always been a bad liar; people can see right through me.  When you're as bad as I am, you learn that telling the truth is much safer.  But apparently, I look like I'm lying when I tell the truth, too.  At this point, I don't care what the e-mail said.  I care that I am being labeled a liar for not knowing about it, and I care that people would think that I'd try to sabotage their grades.  I don't know how these people have gotten this image of me in their head.  I've done some not-nice things - I'd be the first to admit that, but I am  not  this... evil person that they seem to think I am.  And, really, the only thing I've done is to talk - all of this mess is due to me saying things to people that I thought were my friends.  We used to be friends.  Did they not, at some point, recognize some goodness in me?  An old friend of mine claims that I walk into the Twilight Zone every time I come back to North Carolina.  I think that may be the least confusing explanation I've heard...

						   There is a gym here at the med school (which I never use, because I have a complex about people I know seeing me in work-out clothes).  I often use the bathroom in it, because it is close to the study room.  In this bathroom is a much-admired (by me, anyway)  Skinny Mirror.   For those of you onto Harry Potter lingo, I'd have to compare it to the  Mirror of Erised.   For those of you who aren't - it's just freaking awesome, and somewhat hypnotic.  Something about skinny mirrors can manage to cheer up most girls, I think.  It's like seeing dreams fulfilled.    Anyway...  I just didn't pass (i.e. failed) the written ACLS test - by two questions - but a trip to the Skinny Mirror cheered me right on up!  That and the fact that I did well on the HARD part of the test - where I had to pretend to run an actual code (my patient lived!)  Plus, I can re-take the written in 10 days, and I'll be sure to do well then.  NOW comes the scary part of my day: I have my meeting with the Dean and "those three."  I'm really quite nervous.  Breathe... they are only people - people who I used to get along with smashingly.  I can do this.  I am invincible!!!  Well, maybe not, but at least I have a place to go where I can pretend to be skinny!

						   I've never been a big gambler - never felt like the odds would favor me.  Today, however, I have managed to beat ALL the odds imaginable.  It's like a "when-it-rains-it-pours" kinda day.  (I should write a song called that...)  Today our class was split into 16 groups to start training for ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support... or Awfully Complicated Life Saving...?) .  I don't know how the groups were assigned - it seemed random, yet I was in the same group as the me-haters.    Then, this evening we finally found out who exactly we'll be working with for the next eight weeks.  I am to be paired up with two people, out of a possible 15.  I did not want to be with 3 of these 15, leaving 12 possible people that I could have been paired with.  So.  I'm not great at figuring out odds, but I do know that the chances were pretty good that I not be paired with them.  But.  Today is all about beating the odds, so...  Two weeks with one person who is not speaking to me, and four weeks with another (the other two weeks I'm on my own).  And...none of them got to be with each other!  I feel bad for them as well...  Chalk it up to a good chance to learn how to play nice with others, though.  I think things will be more manageable one-on-one than they are three-on-one...  Speaking of which, we are all going to speak to one of the deans tomorrow.  Why a dean, I'm not sure...  I kind of get it, but at the same time, all the issues have been personal, and this seems so...official.    Ack.  Being serious is no fun.  Susan says I should go into peds because no one else will appreciate my humor.  :)  Heck, yeah!  Oh, yeah... my computer totally bit it today, too (I'm at Susan's house currently)...  I don't know how salvagable it is at this point.  If it was working, I'd be on it buying my ticket to Vegas.  Yeah, baby!  Deep breath.

						   Ack!  I have to put in an IV in about an hour.  And I have to let someone put one in me as well!  I'm not sure which is scarier...  We were peering thru the two-way mirror at the last group that was doing it.  One guy was definitely on the verge of passing out.  Not a happy expression on his face.  More like: "I hate you, now die."  Ack.

						   Life is hard sometimes, and is made even more so when people don't behave in ways that become them.  I am often the one behaving inappropriately, but not always.  Today, I think I've been doing a good job...  It's the first time I've been around the people who decided to no longer be my friend since the night that it all happened.  We have to work together for the next year, so I assumed we'd have some sort of contact today - a hello, a smile, a glare, a slap across the face...something.  But, nope.  Nothing.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  Does any one have any advice?  How do I make people that are not talking to me change?  Is there some secret?  I'm totally clueless, and feel helpless.  Time heals all wounds.  I just wish time would fast forward a bit...  On another note - This was in my horoscope today:  The next ten days promise to be major milestones in your personal history. Just imagine what you can do next.   Weird?  Maybe...

						   Real life resumes, and I've already got a stack of things that I need to get done.  Bills, etc.  How boringly annoying.  Some day I'll hire someone to do this stuff for me.  Actually, I probably won't, because that seems like a royal waste of money.  But doesn't it sound appealing???  The most annoying thing that I'm doing is financial aid stuff, though, and I'll be done with that after the next couple of years.  It's warm in North Carolina!  Not in the room in which I am currently sitting, but outside it is!  How wonderful.  Not that it matters.  I've sworn off sun for two very important reasons: 1) I feel it is time to take sun care precautions seriously and 2) I'm going to be working all day every day, anyway.  My sister went to visit my old  urlLink alma mater  to see if she wants to go there.  I loved St. Olaf, and I think she would too, but apparently she got housed with some... not-very-nice person.  That makes me mad.  Grrrr.  (that's me being mad)  She's narrowed it down to two schools - that is a hard choice.  I was upset when I only got into one med school, but at least I didn't have to make any decisions!  And, the more I think about it, I think my deep hatred of North Carolina stems from the fact that I'm stressed out all the time here.  I'd probably really like it otherwise.  SO!  Had I gotten into my state school, I may have grown to hate Portland, which would have been a travesty.  Everything turns out for the best in the end.  I don't envy Lindsay her decision, though.  She'll do the right thing.    Question:  The phrase "Well, if you think that, you've got another thin_ coming"  Is it a "G" or a "K?"  I always thought it was "thinG," but was just recently introduced to the idea that it may be "thinK."  Which is right???  I kind of think 'you've got another think coming' makes more sense, but that would mean that I've been wrong for some 20+ years, which is a hard thing for me to accept.  :)  AHH!  I need sun!

						   My test results from  urlLink okcupid .   The Priss    Deliberate   Brutal   Love   Dreamer    Mature. Responsible. Aristocratic. Excuse me. The Priss.   Prisses are the smartest of all female types. You're highly perceptive, and confident in your judgements. You'd take brutal honesty over superficiality any time--your friends always know where they stand with you. You're completely unfake. Don't tell me that's not a word. You're also excellent at redirecting internal negative energy.   These facts indicate people are often intimidated by you. They also fall for you, hard. You have a distant, composed allure that many find irresistible. If only more of them lived up to your standards.    You were probably the last among your friends to have sex. And the first to pretend that you're pregnant. LOL. Though you're inclined to use sex as weapon, at least it's not as one of mass destruction. You're choosier than most about your partners. A supportive relationship is what you're really after. Whether you know it or not, you need something steady & long-term. And soothing.   ALWAYS AVOID: The Playboy, The Loverboy   CONSIDER: The Manchild

						   Back in Portland.  Time flies...  I'm so tired, yet I still feel the need to blog.  It's somewhat addictive, this.  You wouldn't think so, but it is - try it and find out!  I don't  wanna  go back!  This trip has been too much fun, and too stress-free to think about going back.  I don't deal well with change, and our entire lives are about to change radically.  I'm freakin' scared!  I have NO clue what we are supposed to be doing.  I feel bad that I'm not excited about the new things we're about to encounter.  Isn't this what we've been working towards?  We're almost there!  I should be chomping at the bit, but I'm all ready to head back out to that prairie, where I was chomping on some mighty tasty greens.  Ack!  I can't decide if I feel more anxious about the fact that everything is changing, or about the fact that I'm not excited about it.  Got that?  Am I making any sense here?  Hmm.  Anyway.  Our trip was fantastic.  Susan and I even managed to be in bad moods (mostly) at the same time, thus saving the other person from playing "cheer-up" or "politely ignore."  We both got to do "quiet grump" together.  What a way to bond!  Where'd I leave off?  Oh, yes.  San Francisco.  Love it.  Want to live there someday.  (as well as Greece, Charleston, NYC, DC, Seattle, Montana, London...)  Tuesday, we did some  urlLink shopping , which I swore I wouldn't do.  We also took a ferry out to  urlLink Sausalito , which was beautiful.  So many wonderful art galleries there.  Susan and I decided to come back in ten years, when we may actually be able to pretend to afford a corner of one of the paintings we saw.  I can't imagine spending lots of money on art, but then I see a picture, and it just belongs to me.  Then I feel the need to spend money on it.  Lots and lots of money...  But not yet!  We left SF on Wednesday, to go visit  urlLink Yanna  in San Diego.  That was the shortest leg of our journey - only two nights there, and one full day.  We found the sun again in San Diego - it had deserted us at times in SF.  So.  I don't think most of you realize how candid I am about some things...  But I need to get this off my chest, so forgive me, please.  When travelling, and eating lots of food, and staying at other people's houses, there are certain...  urlLink functions , of the bodily variety, which can prove a bit... difficult to coordinate.  So, we got to Yanna's family's house, and I was overcome.  I just had to go.  And I clogged the freaking toilet.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I am the Amazing Toilet Clogger.  I'm in the bathroom, and there is no plunger (I'm flashing back to the scene from "Along Comes Polly," but there was no ferret).  I tried to do what I could - which mostly consisted of me standing there looking confused/annoyed - what a great plumber I'd make!  Then I remembered that Yanna has a large, Russian-Jewish family.  I started thinking: "Oh my gosh.  I probably just broke at least two or three major social etiquette laws (one: pooping in someone's house your first time there; two: clogging the freaking toilet; three: freaking out about it; four: I don't know, I haven't studied the culture!)"  Then I wondered if Yanna's father was part of some ultra-secret, Jewish Russian mafia, and they'd come after me for being so rude and offensive in their home.  [Side bar: of course Yanna's father is not in the Mafia.  At least, I don't think so...]  Anyway, long story shorter, I went and confessed my sin to Yanna, and she said to put the lid down, and later it was just miraculously fixed.  Those mafia must have good plumber connections - wonder if they have a spot for a confused/annoyed looking dame...  San Diego is gorgeous.  And I learned how to SALSA!!!  Well.   Kind of.  I learned how one  should  salsa, and then proceeded to make up my own version of it, which involved lots of tripping and hitting people.  There were lessons at the beginning, in which Susan and I eagerly participated.  When it came time to actually partner up - we were in two long gender-specific lines - all the guys across from us made a beeline straight to the girls on either side of us.  Susan and I were left there towering over all the freshly formed salsa couples.  Quite embarassing.  Kind of like in jr. high, at dances when you're left sitting in a chair by the wall while everyone dances.  Actually.  It was exactly like that...  Thankfully, there were more guys, so they got stuck with us.  I even danced after the lessons - though no guy was brave enough to ask me to dance twice...  :)  Yanna was a star.  I tried to learn from her, but it didn't stick.  I've determined what my main problem is with dancing: I can't do it!  Actually, the problem is that I can't follow a guy's lead.  I am off doing my own thing, which generally involves lots of spinning.  I like spinning...  The bed is calling my name, and there are way too many words here already.  Why are you still reading this??  Don't you have better things to do with your life???  Back to NC tomorrow.  Wish me - and all of us - luck!

						   ...in San Francisco.  But that's okay, because I'm here to re-claim it!  Actually, I've never  really  left my heart anywhere, but that's how the song goes, and I'm a slave to song lyrics.  Or something.  San Francisco is fun.  And windy.  Thankfully, with my new shorter hair, I can pull off the 'windblown' look with more ease.  Though, something must be said for the ponytail look, which I can no longer pull off.  Unless I'm working out.  Then I do the 'I'm working out' ponytail, which looks kind of like those fake hair things that you can buy at drug stores - you know - like a scrunchie, but made of hair.  That's my 'workout' ponytail.  We made it from Portland to Oakland with no problems.  Again, it was probably because I didn't check luggage.  I oughtta do that more often.  We're staying with my friend, Heidi, in her cute little place.  She has nice plates.  I'm sleeping on an air mattress, and Susan is on a blow-up beach toy.  :)  Gotta love being in your 20s.  Today, we went to the SFMOMA (Museum of Modert Art, for those of you who aren't pretentious enough to refer to it as MOMA).  They have a Pop art exhibit right now, which is fabulous.  Unless you haven't eaten in a long time, in which case, you want to rip Andy Warhol's Campbell's soup can OFF the wall and shove it in your mouth.  Somehow, I don't think the myriad of MOMA guards would have appreciated that...    We've also done a lot of wandering around, which is always one of my favorite things to do.  We rode on BART, and a cable car.  No boats, but maybe tomorrow.  I bought a painting from a woman on the street, which was also exciting.  Local art and all.  Not pop art, either.  Now we're at Pier 39, and there are boats (which I'm not on) and seagulls and wind.  Lots of wind.  And hunger.  I'm hungry again, which is kind of suprising, considering that in our wanderings today, I've purchased lots of chocolate.  Mmmmm.  Chocolate.  Love.  I'm actually paying money for this, so you'd better be enjoying it!!!  More fun to come.  If you're me anyway, I don't know what all y'all are doing.  On the off chance that Michael does read this: GOOD LUCK TOMORROW!!!  And GOOD LUCK TO MEG (in a few days).

						   Okay.  I seriously just spent the last 40 minutes on a blog, and... it just disappeared.  I'm slightly annoyed.  Here's a recap: I love Portland Southern Hospitality is a Myth      and, as a Northerner, I am rude to my friends and nice to strangers  urlLink Powell's Books  is possibly the best place on Earth. Old friends are fabulous I'm going to the Columbia River Gorge and  urlLink Multnomah Falls  today, possibly the most beautiful place on Earth.  I'm sad that the post disappeared.

						   ...that's what they say, right?  Well, ha!  I proved them wrong!  I'm home!  Granted, this hasn't really been my  home  home since I left for college in 1996.  And every time I have come back since then, things just a bit less like my old childhood home.  So, now that this is potentially the last time I'll be in this house, I'm okay with it.  It's been a gradual change.  My youngest sister will have to do the fast ripping-off-of-the-band-aid shift in homes, but I got the...dissolvable stitches?  Does that analogy work?  Hmm...  Yay!  I'm in Portland.  I love Portland.  My friend  urlLink Susan  came along for the West Coast Tour, and I can't wait to show Portland off.  It is even sunny today!!!  Yesterday was a tiring day - up at 4:30 am, an hour and a half drive to the airport, layover in Minneapolis (I had not been in Minnesota since college graduation in 2000, so that was a bit poignant...for an airport...) and finally to Portland.  I got here at 1 pm Portland time, 4pm my body time.   But, for once, my luggage made it safely.  Of course, I took it all carry-on, so there wasn't much chance of them losing it, but I feel the need to celebrate that anyway.  I tend to have luggage problems.  Okay... things to do and fun to have!

						   I spent last night purging.  It felt great!  Don't worry, I'm not venturing into the dangerous world of the ultra-thin and extremely messed up.  I prefer to let my binging stay put, thank you very much.  I purged paper.  Two years worth of paper.  I decided that enough was enough, and there was no reason for me to hold onto the notes I made while studying nitrogen metabolism or major histocomaptability complexes.    As I am an admittedly hopeless pack-rat, this was a very big deal for me.  I see the potential for EVERYthing to possibly be useful in a pivotal way some day.  Imagine being caught without it!  Horrors!  How would I survive if I didn't have the clear plastic CD-shaped things that come on the top of a new pack of CD-ROMs?  I mean?  What if I needed... an extra coaster... or... a new face plate for a clock or a mini-frisbee?  You never know.  Ooo, it would make a good circular stencil, too...  What potential lay within those 15-20 notebooks full of paper?  Knowledge!  In my own handwriting!  What riches!  In some part of my brain, I was going to use those notes often during our clinical rotations, and even beyond in my medical practice.  The other 99.7% of my brain - the logical part - was able to beat that little voice into submission last night.  I tossed it all!  I whittled it all down into one, slim, efficient Notebook of Knowledge.  And, believe it or not, I'm tempted to toss that, too!  Bring in the new!  Out with the old!  It feels good to get rid of some old baggage.  Now, I'm lighter and more portable.  I can pick up and leave at a moment's notice.  Well.  Actually, not really.  I only purged class notes.  I still have the rest of my life nicely packed away into little rat holes all over the country.  Maybe some day I'll get to those, too...  But now, I need to go home and pack!  Tomorrow begins my West Coast Tour.  Or, should I say The Important Parts of the West Coast Tour.  Those being: Portland, San Francisco and San Diego.  As a true Oregonian, I cannot acknowledge the existence of the middle part of California.  ALSO: A true Oregonian recylces.  So, while I may have 'purged' my notes...they're actually still in my apartment, waiting to be hauled to a recycling center...  So sue me!

						   I am addressing the gentlemen out there tonight.  Not that I expect there are all that many that actually  read  my blog, but whatever.  These things need to be said, and I feel it is my mission to say them.    The lesson today is:   Bar/Club Behavior.     Lesson 1:  Eye Contact. Just because a girl makes eye contact with you does NOT mean that she is interested.  Even if she makes repeated eye contact with you, do not start thinking that you are hot stuff.  More than likely, you are just in the line of sight of a) the bathroom; b) the slutty looking girl her friend just pointed out or c) the guy she really is trying to make eye contact with.  Eye contact is NOT about quantity, it is about quality.  Remember this rule - it is applicable to many areas of life.   Lesson 2:  Dancing. Go for it.  Personally, I think it is kind of cute when a guy is willing to make a fool of himself out on the dance floor - and I'm not the only girl who feels this way.  Just try to not hit anyone with your flailing limbs, and it's all good.  As an addendum to this rule, however: if you DO notice that people are pointing, glaring or otherwise creating a ten foot buffer zone around you, you may want to tone it down a bit.   Lesson 3:  Getting a Clue. When you are dancing closer to a girl, in an attempt to "make your move," if you will, and you notice that she is edging away, getting closer and closer to the wall (or to the guy with the ten foot buffer zone): SHE IS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.  It is as simple as that.  She is not playing hard to get: she is just not interested.  This is doubly, or triply true, if it is an entire  group  of girls edging away.   Lesson 4:  What Girls Wear. Some girls in bars and clubs are looking to get picked up.  Some are not.  There is no way to tell the difference by just looking.  There is not a simple equation like: more cleavage = more likely to come home with me.  Granted, some girls put it all out there, but contrary to popular belief, that does not mean she is 'easy.'  It just means she likes the way she looks, even if she may be in an ill-advised white vinyl mini skirt and fluorescent green tube top.  How to know if a girl is on the prowl?  I refer back to Lesson 1, or to general common sense.  If a girl is all over you, chances are, she's more likely to be on the prowl.  Notice that I did not say that she IS on the prowl.  Remember that you are in a bar, there is a copious amount of liquor present, so NOTHING is certain.   Lesson 5:  Bartender Etiquette. Not being a bartender, I cannot speak for them.  Being a person who uses bartenders to receive drinks in exchange for money, I have one final lesson/plea for all you men.  When you see a girl approaching the bar, with that determined "man, I need a drink," look in her eyes, let her through.  Have some heart for the poor girl who is forced to purchase her own drink, and don't make her elbow her way up to the front.  Heck, if you're feeling magnanimous, offer to buy her a drink.  Don't expect anything in return, but you'll make the girls night, believe me.  And you might just build up some good karma for yourself - that vinyl-skirted, tube-topped girl may just start giving you some very quality eye contact while you're out boogie-ing on the dance floor...  These are my lessons for you.  Learn them.  Use them.  And stop bugging me when I'm out trying to have fun.  Especially if you have a pony tail or the same glasses you wore in junior high.

						   I'm usually a pretty generous tipper, but do you tip people when your order take-out and they bring it to your car?  I just don't know the etiquette on that one.  I decided to splurge for dinner, and ordered Italian from  urlLink Carrabas .   Mmmmm....I love me some Italian food.  After I placed the order, I decided to find a grocery store to get foodstuffs for tomorrow.  I went to the test center today - there is nothing even close to it, except for a Ham's.  I don't think I should go to a place calle Ham's during my test.  I just don't think that would be good.  So, I drove and drove in one direction, looking for a grocery store to no avail.  When I pulled in to turn around, I JUST about got hit by a speeding little gray-black stupid car.  Thus strengthening my stance that people who drive cars that MATCH the road should always have their lights on.  Especially at dusk.  Grrrr.  So, no grocery store.  I decided that Walgreen's would do.  I almost got hit again in the Walgreen's parking lot - this time I was a pedestrian, though, and the car DID have it's lights on, but the woman was looking in her purse, not at ant people she was about to hit (i.e. ME).  Wanna know what my lunch is going to be tomorrow?  Hmm?  Do ya?  Okay, here it is: beef jerky, rice cakes, a granola bar and Gatorade.  Yup.  Reminder: I had to shop at  urlLink Walgreen's .   I have a banana, too, that I brought from home.  So, then I went to get my lovely Italian food.  They bring it out right to the car!  I didn't see the "additional bonus: be hit on!" in the menu, but I didn't look at all the fine print.  Needless to say, I didn't tip.  I decided that if my mere presence was enough to make this young man with the ankle-length apron practically do back-flips for me, that was enough for him.  Back to the Drury Inn for dinner.  There is a secure area where you can park, but I couldn't make it work, so I had to back up and do all this maneuvering to get out of the way.  Some random old guy in a Charlie Brown shirt stood watching me with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.  Up in my room (302), I discovered that I had no silverware.  A call to the desk reveals that this Inn does not provide silverware, though they do offer complimentary microwave popcorn and plastic cups.  I informed them that I had enough cups, thank you very much.  Dilemma:  good, greasy Italian food, and nothing to eat it with.  I debated becoming creative.  I have the little straws to stir coffee, mechanical pencils, and as many plastic cups as I could want.  Feeling more hunger than initiative, I decided to eat my Italian food Indian style - with my hands.  Mmmmmm.  Indian-style Italian food.  Nothing beats that.  You know what makes the best napkin?  I bet you think I'm going to say Kleenex, or even toilet paper, but that isn't right.  The right answer: bread.  Who knew bread was so multi-functional.  See what all those no-carb people are missing????  Let's recap now: I was almost killed, twice; I'm eating beef jerky for lunch tomorrow; I ridiculed myself in front of geriatric Charlie Brown and I got my nice pink shirt all greasy because food doesn't stay in my fingers as well as it does on a fork.  All the makings of a great test day tomorrow.  What you don't realize, if you don't know me, is that it is TRUE!  The more my life resembles a comedy of errors, the more likely the end result is to be positive.  So, great!  I'm encouraged!  My new dilemma: how to watch 3 TV shows at the same time.  Tragic, I know.

						   Isn't there a nursery rhyme with Drury in it?  The Muffin Man?  Is that right?  Do you know the muffin man?  Yes, well.  I am at the Drury Inn, awaiting my judgment day.  The area around here is a bit...sketchy, but the room is okay, and there is High Speed Internet, which is amazingly nice.  Otherwise, I'd only have the television to distract me.  Now I have the interenet, too!  I'm not feeling very clever tonight.  I feel more like if I move my head too quickly, all the information that is precariously balanced in there will start spewing out my ears.  I will be so glad when this is over.  Oh my, oh my.  Soon.

						   I'm officially done studying.  What happens, happens.  Man, this is scary.  I've done SO many questions (1673 at least), though... this should all be a breeze now.  Wish me luck!  Man.  It's April Fool's Day, too.  Too stressed out to even try anything... how sad!  No.  I'm not stressed.  I'm maintaining Zen-like calm.  I am Zen epitomized.  Go Zen!

						   This morning, I received a page (about my fourth ever 'real' one) from the Academic Computing office.  My computer is back!  It completely died several weeks ago, and is now to be returned to me with a brand-new hard drive, and a new monitor, but sans any files that I had saved on it.  To me, this combination equals 'new computer.'  Kind of exciting!  Also kind of sad, as I mourn the passing of my faithful companion of my first two years of medical school.    So.  Not terribly long after my Fourth Real Page, I had to use the facilities.  In the process, I managed to drop my pager...in the toilet.  (Thankfully after I'd flushed)  As I stood there pondering the age old pager-in-the-toilet dilemma, I realized that this was an automatic motion-sensing toilet.  Now, these things never work for me at the  urlLink apropos  time.  However, when I have a pager sitting in the bottom of the toilet, it decides to conveniently start working, forcing me to plunge my hand into the bowl to rescue said pager.  Good grief.  I don't even like the thing, but I just couldn't let it come to such an end.  Not yet, anyway.  Maybe at the end of fourth year...  Just in case you were curious: pagers don't swim.  So, now I'm pager-less until Wednesday, when the 'pager person' is in from 11-2.  In case you were curious, I know say "Wednesday" like I'm from the south, which means it has about 27 syllables.  It's kind of fun - you should definitely try it.  Repeat after me: Weh-uns-d-ah-ay.   In other news: 1. A  urlLink new dinosaur species  was discovered in Montana.  The interesting thing about  Suuwassea emilieae  is that it has a 'mysterious'extra hole in its skull.  I'm thinking that may be why the poor thing went extinct.  Hole in head does not lend itself to survival, in my humble opinion.  2. I don't know how I missed this: Andy Kaufman is alive and well, and is  urlLink blogging  right here on blogspot.  Hmmm.  Or  urlLink  is he?   The  urlLink debate  continues.   Personally, I would have to ask: why on  earth  would Andy Kaufman start a blog?  I prefer to think he'd be off with Elvis having a grand old party.  3. A certain female in our class (whose name has a paucity of syllables and vowels) is sporting a rather large diamond on a rather prominent finger.  And talks with her hands a lot.  This may be a 'daddy-loves-me-oh-so-much' ring, but I don't know...  4. I get my root canal tomorrow!  Saints be praised!  I never thought I'd be looking forward to it, but I'm ready to get this stinking sedative filling out.

						   All day at Carowinds!  I'm exhausted.  I just had to write my observation that, though it is best to find a swim suit that shows off your best features, it is difficult to find one that shows off your brain.  That's all.  Bed is calling my name.  Can you hear it?

						    urlLink ...So what happens now?  Where am I going to?   Gen Med D, that's where!  I can't believe my two weeks in heme/onc are at an end.  They went by in a flash.  But they also took forever, so...  Time again plays tricks on my brain.  I feel bad reporting that my patients are oriented X4 (person, place, time and situation), when I really only make it to 2 - and that's on a good day.  My latest dilemma: I seem to bond well with the elderly.  Really well.  I even got flowers from one (and her daughter is going to send a letter of praise to the clerkship director - I didn't even have to beg for that!)  I even have a good time just sitting and chatting with my 65+ yo patients.  My problem with this: does this mean I should be a  urlLink geriatrician?   Does it?  I've always said pediatrics was the road for me, but I honestly have very little experience with pediatric medicine.  I've played with sick kids, but I've never had to care for them.  And I like old people!  And it really bothers me to see the way some people treat them.  I just don't know that I could handle it day after day after day...  We'll see what happens.  I do my peds rotation in January.  It's the weekend!  I actually  get  a weekend this weekend!  I don't know what to do with myself.  I still have no $$, so I pretty much have to stay home-bound.  Or the YMCA.  Actually, I am going to  urlLink Carowinds  on Sunday...that is costing me some money...but...it's so much fun!  And... my birthday is coming up...so...I'll call this an early birthday present to myself.  Yee-haw!  Okay.  The weekend has started, yet here I sit in the library at school.  I must get out!  Maybe I'll dye my hair.  That would be fun.  Asheville.  I want to go there.  And Charleston.  Why are these random people in here talking about all these fun places to go?  And sailing classes!  And canoes!  Good grief.  My head is going to explode.  Now they're bragging about all the 'fun' people they know.  I'm a fun person!  I know fun people!  Think they'd mind if I joined the convo?  GAH!  I'm getting out of here!  I have pretty flowers at home!  :)

						   Lex Luthor.  Is he one sexy villain, or what?  The guy on  urlLink Smallville  anyway.  There is another student here that looks remarkably like  urlLink Michael Rosenbaum.   Though, after a look at some of M. Rosenbaum's publicity pictures, the guy looks much better sans hair.  Just a thought.  Other sexy villains?  I'm completely drawing a blank, but I know there are many.    It's on-call night again!  They come so frequently...  Ah, well, this is the last time I'm on call in Heme/Onc.  I go to general medicine next.  Should be interesting.    Anyway, I'm watching Smallville right now.  It's hard to follow a show that you only see once or twice a season.  I think I'd choose Lex over Clark if I lived in whatever town it is that they live in.  Ha.  Smallville.  I seriously could not figure that out for a minute...  I'm apparently more sleep-deprived than I thought.  Le sigh.  The Kents' house just exploded...?  And apparently Lex is...dropping dead?  Confusing show.  I'm waiting for American Idol to come on.  Yee-haw!  I can't wait to find out what happens.  Will Fantasia make it thru the night?  I do hope so.  I'm a reluctant fan, but I actually like Fantasia.  I'd probably buy a CD, even.  Yes.  I  will  buy a CD!  I'm being decisive.  Tom Welling.  Too attractive, yes or no?  Paperwork is calling my name.  I'm going to get ahead!

						   In an attempt to entertain myself, I ventured into the med school library.  At last!  A place to ensconce myself for a couple of hours!  Alas, I arrived a mere half hour before their closing.  In that half hour, I discovered the "History of Medicine" room, and a nice comfy hunter-green armchair.  I was sitting amongst all these old books about plague and war - how cool is that?  Anyway, I pulled a book off the shelf to check it out.  It was  Courage and Devotion Beyond the Call of Duty   Being a Partial Record of Official Citations to Medical Officers in the United States Armed Forces During World War II.   I skimmed through some of it - lots of doctors getting Silver and Bronze medals for putting themselves in harms way to save their fellow soldiers.  While that is all incredibly cool in itself, this particular entry caught my eye:  "The Soldier's Medal was awarded to Captain Luke K. Remley of York, Pa.  The citation states: 'On August 26, 1943 at . . ., Tunisia, Captain Remley was assisting two (2)  (my interjection here: the parenthetical numbers were apparently in the official citation.  I love that - like I don't understand what 'two' means unless I see the actual numeral)  officers of his squadron in arranging their flying equipment on their aircraft, when suddenly without warning  (isn't that the definition of suddenly?)  a B-17 type aircraft loaded with bombs, dispersed nearby  violently exploded  (what does that mean? it was just sitting there, then exploded?) , hurling thousands of fragments of burning metal over a wide-spread area and showering the immediate vicinity of the aircraft with burning gasoline and oil.  (how dramatic!)   The concussion that followed was so instantaneous and forceful that three (3) officers were hurled  (hurled!!!)  to the ground and momentarily stunned.  Upon recovering from the fall  (the hurling fall)  Captain Remley rushed from the scene of the disaster in an attempt to save himself.  (why else would he be rushing away? to catch the falling burning metal fragments on his tongue?)   Noting that one (1) of the officers was not running alongside  (hey, maybe he was just slower) , Captain Remley wheeled about  (he  wheeled  people!)  and dashed headlong into the rain of flying missiles and falling debris that was showering the path between him and his fellow officer who was lying on the ground uninjured.  (at which point I would have averred: get up, you lazy cur! you made me wheel and headlong-ed-ly dash into raining fiery missiles, and here you lie, without enough sense to rush from the scene of the disaster in an attempt to save yourself!)   Utterly disragarding the imminent danger of the bombs detonating in the aircraft by the impending mass of flame and inferno that was encircling it, and the fifty (50) calibre shells that were erratically exploding and striking the plane in numerous places, Captain Remley carried the officer over his back to a place of safety.  The presence of mind and heroism displayed by this officer reflect great credit upon himself and the armed forces of the United States of America.  (and the writing of this citation reflects great credit upon the author, who obviously read a lot of comic books) '  Captain Remley is also the recipient of the Bronze Star.  He graduated from Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia in 1938."  I love this post.  I've always been amazed by doctor-soldiers, and WWII in general.  This is just a fun little story to read - and it is true!  My only question, in the end, is why was the doctor arranging his flying equipment in the first place?  I thought doctors stayed on the ground.  Well, anyway.  Thanks, Captain Luke K. Remley - you rock.  I hope your days were filled with more rushing and wheeling and running headlong into lots of joyous occasions.

						   So, I'm here at the hospital...  I'm on call tonight, which means I had to come to morning rounds, then stay all day until 11pm, then come back tomorrow morning for rounds again.  The only problem with this is that I have  nothing  to do.  My two patients need absolutely nothing today.  We have room to take on one more patient, but that never seems to happen during the day (people always wait until late-night to present to the ED).  So, here I am.  Waiting...    I've had time to mess around on-line, and have discovered that Gwyneth Paltrow gave birth to a large, healthy baby girl, who she then proceeded to name  urlLink Apple .  Apple .  Honey, that's a fruit, not a child.  Apple  urlLink cider .  Apple  urlLink sauce.   Apple  urlLink pie .  Apple  urlLink Jolly Ranchers .  Does Gwyneth  not  see these things coming???  On a separate note, I wonder what people call  urlLink Gwyneth  for short... Gwyn?  Neth?  Gwynnie?  My stomach is a bottomless pit today.  I'm hungry.  The cafeteria here is really not that great.  But I want food!  Nice, soft, easily chewed food.  I only have a temporary filling in my tooth as I await my ::drumroll::  urlLink Root Canal!!!   How exciting.  The  urlLink dentist  the other day was very nice, but unfortunately the combination of his niceness and my finger-crossedness did not serve to save me from the dreaded canal of root.  Tired.  And hungry.    And bored.  There must be something to do...

						   One of my patients is dying.  Really, really dying.  Like, he'll be dead within a few hours.  If he's lucky.  If not, he'll hang on for a few more days being just miserable.  He's DNR (do not resuscitate), otherwise he'd have a tube down his throat and a machine making him breathe.  His entire family is here.  He's got metastatic lung cancer - he was a smoker.  Another of my patients, also with lung cancer, also from smoking, just had a CT scan that shows metastases to the liver.  Hepatic mets is one of the worst prognostic signs of lung cancer.  She'll be dead within a few months.  Today is not a good day to be my patient.  Now, I'm going to the dentist.

						   Just had to share the back-of-the-book blurb on a book I found in the conference room here:    Title: Between the Sheets  The only action April Stevens has been seeing between the sheets lately is sleep.  Not her preference, but since her inability to relax has proven almost fatal to too many past lovers, she's given up sex.  Fine. Except that her latest assignment has her going  undercover  with marketing hottie,  er , genius Rex Holt...field-testing risque sheet sets!  As if  that's  going to keep her mind off sex...especially when Rex is tempting enought to make her reconsider that little vow of celibacy.  Between the sexy bed linens and his even sexier assistant April, Rex's job has gotten  interesting .  He has sex on he brain.  Conducting  personal  trial runs on the sheets with April should clear his...mind.  Instead, Rex finds himself craving even more of her--he just has to convince her that what they have is more than a bit of fun and relaxation.  Good thing he can sell anything...including himself.   Thoughts: 1. When it says that her 'inability to relax has proven almost fatal,' do you think it actually means that this April Stevens has almost killed poor men during sex? 2. April Stevens is not a very exciting name for a 'romance' heroine.  (not like  Misty Fortune , the heroine of another book I found here called  Against the Odds ) 3. Rex Holt is a  perfect  name for a 'romance' hero. 4. Do you suppose they advertise for "risque sheet set tester" in the classifieds? 5. Does this actually qualify as a plot?  What could the climax be? 6. Could these words all be code for something actually resembling a story, or is this truly just a book where people just have sex? 7. Does the author of this book have her work on display at home? 8. What inspired the story? 9. How many publishers did the author have to send the book to until it got picked up? 10. Are trashy 'romance' novels of this caliber merely porn for women?  What about Danielle Steele?  Nora Roberts?  D.H. Lawrence?  Charlotte Bronte?  Where is the line between 'romance' and 'trash?'  Okay... enough thinking.  Time to leave here and see what it is like in the real world!

						   Totally inappropriate work activities #37: Looking at Match.com  Okay, so a while ago I joined match.com cause I thought it would be funny.  And believe me, it is.  I have a folder on my hotmail account called "Match Duds."  There is no "Match Superstars" folder.  Though, not everyone is totally bad, most of the e-mails I've received just don't fit with me.  Anyway.  A few months ago, I took my profile off, but then I realized I missed getting the electronic attention - however infrequent it is.  But I didn't want to run the risk of having to meet any of these guys, so this time I posted my profile in Portland.  I just got an e-mail today.  They guy seemed very nice and normal, but then, in his profile under the "Favorites" category, he had actually written: "I enjoy sateen shirts, khaki pants and the gentle smell of a woman's perfume."  Okay.  Now, khaki pants, that's fine; cheesy remarks about gentle-smelling women, I can live with.  Sateen shirts, not acceptable.  Sateen = shiny shirt = something wrong in the head.  Unless you are a)female, b)flamingly homosexual, or c)a well-built Latino Salsa dancer, you should NOT wear shiny shirts.  Much less list that as number ONE of your favorite things.  Good grief.  I feel very strongly about this.  Back to my patients.  They wear nice, sturdy cotton gowns.  Not a shiny shirt among them.  Wait!  I take that back.  One gentleman wears shiny, sateen pajamas.  I wonder if that would send match-boy into fits of rapture?

						   Day One in Heme/Onc, and I manage to make a lasting impression.  Okay, so it wasn't  that  bad, and could have been much worse, but...  There we are, doing rounds, and I start to notice that I'm very warm.  And dizzy.  And, when I stopped to think about it, it wasn't so much that I was warm, as that I was breaking out in a cold sweat.  And I wasn't dizzy so much as I was starting to black out.  So, in the middle of a patient presentation, I turned to the resident, and declared: "I have to sit down!" and then went running down the hall (okay, not running - but I was walking fast) to the nearest stool.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is about hem/onc that made me almost pass out.  I recovered after a few moments of sitting, but I was pretty embarassed.  It looks like this service will be quite different than CCU.  For one thing, the patients are much sicker.  That surprised me.  I figured people in after heart attacks and all would be sicker than people just coming in for chemo.  But, the oncology patients that end up in the hospital are S-I-C-K, sick.  Not a good place to be.  I have to go finish a write-up now.  I can't believe it is already 6pm and I'm still here!  This was supposed to be easier (or at least shorter) than CCU.  Humph.  No yoga tonight...  :(

						   I'm done!  I made it through my first two weeks of third year relatively unscathed.  Two weeks in the Coronary Care Unit.  It went by quickly.  I'm kind of sad to be going.  I really want to know what is going to happen with some of the patients - especially mine!  In total, I took on 7 patients during the two weeks.  There were also several that I was interested in that I followed unofficially - many of whom are still in the CCU.  Supposedly, it is against HIPPA (how's that spelled?) regulations to look at patient information when you're not involved in that patient's care.  But I want to know what is going to happen!  It would be like putting down a really good book right in the middle of a sentence.  I don't know if I can do that...  I wonder if I'll get more blase about this in the future?  I don't always want to be sad when I leave a particular service, but I also don't want to be a heartless doctor.  They throw all these platitudes and ethics at us during our first two years of medical school.  At first, you're totally inspired: "I would never make fun of a patient;" "how could anyone, much less a doctor, forget to make sure that patient got their medicine?"  After a bit, you start to get annoyed, when the fiftieth person tells you how important 'humanism' is in medicine, you feel: "Alright, I get the picture already.  I'll be good.  Get off my case already."  By the time orientation for third year comes around, you just ignore the pleas entirely.  After only two weeks dealing with 'modern medicine,' I'm already starting to see why we were platitude-d and humanized to death.  I don't feel like I can adequately explain it yet, but I'll try to as I continue along this year.  If I'm conscious of it, maybe I can avoid it in myself.    "Rock garden" was what an intern called the CCU one night.  A 'rock' is a patient who will just hang around for a while, not getting better or worse. (similar to  urlLink gomer )  "Rock garden."  It's funny.  I laughed.  But that is exactly the type of thing we were warned against.  We were encouraged to pull the intern or resident or fellow or  attending  aside to tell them that we are not comfortable with that kind of terminology.  But it is funny!  I'm not sure where the happy medium is there, or if there is one.  You're a humanist or you're not.  Is that true?  Who knows?  My eyes are swimming.  I'm sleepy, and tonight is "Whine and Cheese."    AND!  I  just  remembered that Gretchen took her first  urlLink test  yesterday!!!!  GO GRETCHEN!!!!  I hope it went smashingly.  I'll try to remember to call (or you call me!)  I'm off all weekend, and ready for some (mildly) crazy  urlLink fun!

						   There is no reason for me to be this tired.  I was in bed last night by 11, and didn't get up until after 6.  That's over seven hours of sleep - plenty of zzz's for the adult I purport to be.  Maybe I'm getting ill.  It's possible.  Either that, or my brain is just rebelling against the alarm clock's tyranny.  New interns today.  I'm sad to see the old ones go.  You never forget your firsts, you know.  I should track those guys down and tell them that I'll remember them forever.  How creepy stalker-girl would that make me?  :)  It is funny to see how intimidated the new batch looks.  I expected them to be just like the ones that left, but I guess that takes time.  I can't even imagine what I looked like last Monday.  Not that I'm really any more confident now, but at least I now know how rounds work!    I have a patient that moans.  I literally could not do a physical exam this morning, because they were moaning too much.  And my addled 6:45am-alarm-clock-hating brain could not figure out how to make it cease and desist.  The nurse threatened to lock me in the room until I made it stop (she suggested a wash cloth in the mouth).  I think she was only half kidding.  I feel bad for the poor patient.  And there don't appear to be any drugs whose main effect is: 'halts moaning, use 1 Tab, bid (adjust for renal dosage).'   This morning, we had a patient die during rounds.  It was not my patient, but I've seen the patient every day.  It was one of the three patients in here that was on a ventilator.  I never want to be on a ventilator.  It looks just awful.  (I also never want anyone sticking any sort of camera/tube down my throat to look at my insides, iccch - it looks like it is horrendous).  The patients on the ventilators are really sad to me.  That said, if I should ever  really  need a ventilator, go ahead - I'm a bit too young to be DNR...  The patient this morning  was  a DNR patient.  I wasn't any where near the room when it happened, so I don't know what the doctors or nurses did...do they just stand there and watch?  I'm not certain.  I'm sure I'll find out someday, though.  My moaning patient is also DNR.  I think this one might pull through, though.  So sleepy am I.  All my patients (except the moaner) are finally leaving the hospital today!  Thank goodness.  It makes less work for me to do in the morning, and I'll get 15 minutes of extra sleep.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have an anti-moaning idea...

						   ...what could be better definition of that than getting your "monthly" (to put it delicately) in the middle of rounds with an attending who resembles an evil leprechaun?  Slightly loony and slightly biting, all with an Irish lilt.  That's our new attending.  Our previous one  looked  slightly mean, but was actually very nice.  This one looks like Santa's skinnier, nicer (Irish) brother, but is apparently a force to be reckoned with.  Not that it was really all that bad, but I feel the potential.  The interns and residents were all edgy, and there was very little up-front joking today.  Versus Thursday, which was apparently 'squirt who ever is presenting a patient in the face with saline' day.  Apparently yesterday was b-a-d bad.  Today was fine, but I think I'll be nervous the rest of the week!  Still, some part of me has to love a man that uses the words "mirth," "elucidate," "languish," and "mellifluous" during rounds.  I mean, c'mon: how many people actually use those words??  Except for me, but that's only when I'm too tired to remember little words.  I rewarded myself for successfully passing the boards by buying Little House on the Prairie, season 1.  My goodness.  It is by far the most family-values oriented show I've ever seen!  I thought Seventh Heaven was cheesy (and therefore refuse to watch it).  But I still love Laura!  And Pa.  And Nellie Oleson.  Gotta love Nellie Oleson.  Her first line in the series is "country girls..." said all snide-like.  I need to perfect my snide-likeness abilities.  I can't wait to see what happens next in Walnut Grove...    More pretend doctoring to do...

						   I was just going to write something really amazing, but my stupid pager is being stupid again.  I just picked it up, because I brought it in Monday for being stupid.  I thought it was smart now, but nope! Still stupid.    AHH!

						   I'm tired and I'm hungry, and I don't like my upper level, and my patient keeps crying (why, oh, why do people feel the need to tell me all their troubles?!) and my other patient smells like poo, and I have to go to a stupid 3 hour training, and my head hurts and I have NO ONE TO COMPLAIN TO.  Ppbbblllltttt.

						   This weekend, I made an all-encompassing "To Do" list, with the dream of accomplishing everything on it before Monday.  Pipe dreams, of course, but I had to give it a shot.  Knowing that one particular friend would read the list, I included the task: "Get a Date" just to be funny.  Then there was a party Saturday night, and I decided to at least  try  to check that one off.  (Me trying is generally not that effective)  Anyway, I turned my full flirty force on two different lucky guys from our class.  Totally harmless, and a lot of fun, really...    So, today we started new rotations - I'm in neuro, on the stroke service for two weeks, then on general neuro.  (by the way, for anyone keeping track, 2 of the 3 people who hate me have completely DISAPPEARED.  I SWEAR I had nothing to do with it!!!)  The two aforementioned boys (men?  am I that old yet?) are on a different team - together.  They were on rounds this afternoon, and came to the floor I'm on.  I was then faced with a dilemma which I have never experienced before: how to flirt with two guys at once.  Or really, since we were technically at work, and full-force flirting is not really highly encouraged, how to not let either of them think that I was paying more attention to the other.  It was quite a sticky situation.  I felt like Marcia Brady.  With curly hair and glasses.  You know what I discovered, though?  It's kinda fun!  I think I should just keep up the flirting, and never actually check that task off the list...  I'm going on a cruise!  Today begins the "Cruise Body Quest"  That should include going to the Y to work out, but...I don't  wanna!!   I'm tired, I slept horribly last night, I need to be in by 6:30 tomorrow, and it is already past my 6pm rule.  (Home by 6? Y by 7)  So...I'll stick with the less food leg of CBQ, and hopefully I'll have time for the gym leg tomorrow.  Is there another leg?  I haven't seen FNI in many, many days.  Otherwise, I could potentially have 3 males to balance.  Oh what a topsy-turvy world!

						   I love movies.  Just saw  urlLink The Terminal  starring  urlLink Tom Hanks  this weekend.  It was a fantastic movie.  I really enjoyed it, even if it was a full 128 minutes long (plus the 20 or so previews our theater insists on showing - 5 previews: good; 8-10 + commercials: just too many).  I just discovered that this story was loosely based on a real person!  Some guy has been living in the Charles de Gualle airport in Paris since 1988.  I was 10 in 1988.  Don't believe me?  I'm not quite sure if I do... but check it out  urlLink here.   Ah...I fear my internet may be about to crash on me...  And I have dinner coming up, so alas, I must depart.  I'm going on a cruise in August!  Yippeeeee!

						   All technology is revolting against me!  First my pager, then my computer.  I'm a little frightened of going home to see what disastrous events will greet me there.  Argh.  Thankfully, all I needed for the test was a #2 pencil.  I wonder what would really happen if I took a test with a #3 pencil...

						   I have never understood how people in 'business' (generic term for any industry that I know nothing about) could spend 80 hours a week at work - it is just paper and numbers and junk.  At least that's my perception of it - I don't want to offend anyone...Gretchen... :)  I had felt the same way about doctors, too.  Why not just  leave  at the end of the day - it will all be there tomorrow, after all.  After a mere 8 weeks of medicine, I feel differently...  It is really bothering me that I don't know what is going on with my patients.  I actually considered going on rounds again this morning, even though yesterday was our last day.  We're working with people's  lives  here.  We have so much responsibility.  (Well, not me personally, but the team does)  Already, my own needs seem less important than figuring out why a patient is in renal failure, or making sure that another patient's hemoglobin rises appropriately after blood transfusion.  As with everything in medicine, there has to be a balance... Someday, I'm sure I'll find it.  New medical term I learned this week: "squirrel."  Refers to a patient who is faking pain or other symptoms.  We had a squirrel on service this week.  She seemed like she was really having symptoms (nausea/vomiting and severe abdominal pain) even though tests showed nothing.  After they kept her NPO for two days, she miraculously felt better.  I have a test this afternoon.  Blech.  Yesterday, I was sitting outside Jason's Deli waiting for Susan.  One of the high school-aged employees came out for a smoke and a phone call.  She told her friend on the phone that she'd been waiting  over an hour  for a cigarette, and was so riled up that she'd actually slapped a fellow employee.  Slapped!  Because she hadn't had a cigarette!  Does she NOT see something wrong with that?  Good grief, people.  If not having something makes you a raving lunatic, maybe you should try to give it up.  Grr.  I wanted to slap her myself!  But, then, it had been a while since I'd had caffeine... ;)  Rambling, rambling, rambling...

						   That song just popped into my head.  Ominous for my test Friday?  I hope not.  Time to check out.  Not that I'm leaving.  Of course not.  It's CALL NIGHT!!!  And we have room for 9 patients.  That's after being fully-capped for like 3 weeks.  Ugh.  Well, at least my last call night on gen med won't be boring.  Oh, I would tell you why  The ocean's near the shore  I could think of things I never thunk before  And then I'd sit   and think some more...  I would not be just a nuffin'  My head all full of stuffin'  My heart all full of pain  I would dance and be merry  Life would be a ding-a-derry  If I only had a brain    IF ONLY!!!

						    urlLink Former President Bush  is to jump from an airplane tomorrow.  Twice.  (Obviously, he's parachuting, not taking Kevorkian's ethics to the skies.)  His mission is to send out the message that "just because you're 80, that doesn't mean you can't do fun stuff or interesting things."  Fun stuff or interesting things.  I wonder how many 80 year olds are interested in parachuting?  I mean... I am, but I'm 26.    Anyway.  It's 11:30, and I have to be back here at 5:30, so I'm going to go find out if I can go home yet.  I tried (and missed) my first lumbar puncture today!

						   Okay, so yesterday was my birthday.  Yay for me, blah, blah, I'm old and all that jazz.  Now to the real matter at hand: the question of my sanity.  So.  My very first week as a third year medical student, I worked with a team that was entirely male (11 males and me on rounds...odd experience)  They were only there for a week, but during that one week, I let myself become slightly obsessed with one of the males on the team.  The  only  reason for this was that he was single.  To this day, he is the  only  single resident/intern/attending that I have worked with - male or female.  Well, there was one other guy, but I'm 95% sure that he's gay, so he doesn't count.    Anyway.  The intern.  He has kind of a fun name (which I'm not going to post online - I'm not that dumb), so it is kind of fun to repeat it in my head.  Much as one might repeat the phrase "Hearken to the bananas soliloquize rhapsodically."  I was sad when said fun-named intern left the team.  He was a nice guy, after all.  And single, which appears to be my only qualification at times...    I knew that I  could  potentially see him around again, though.  He was doing outpatient stuff for a month, then would be back at the hospital.  I didn't know where, though.  Then.  My first day on general medicine, fun-named intern's brother is on one of the other medicine teams (he's a fourth year med student).  I overhear that FNI is working in the MICU.  Since then I've seen FNI's fun name on several charts of patients that get sent to us from MICU.  But I had no occasion to actually go to the MICU to take care of some spy-team spying.    THEN.  Yesterday, one of the nicest patient's I have had went in for a colonoscopy to look for GI bleeding.  During this, the doctor managed to tear a hole in her colon.  Yeah.  Now it's bleeding.  Darn...  I feel very bad for this patient - BUT - guess where she is right now?  Go on!  Guess!  That's right.  She is in the MICU!  I just went to see her.  AND!!!  FNI was there!  I couldn't come up with an excuse to go talk to him, and I'm not 100% sure that he saw me...but.  It was still fun anyway.  :)  I went to the cafeteria to get a Diet Pepsi to celebrate.  Though...after more than a month... I'm starting to think that maybe I should shift my attentions to FNIB.  That's fun-named intern's brother, who also, incidentally, has a fun name.  Sane or no?  You be the judge.  I'm off hearkening to those lovely bananas.

						   I'm waiting for check out rounds.  So far everyone has shown up.  Just not at the same time.  They peek their head in, then leave when they see that no one else is here.  This has been going on for an HOUR.  I'm starting to get annoyed.  Maybe I'll leave.

						   A personal statement I would  never  respond to:  I am someone with an inquisitive mind who views life as a course of daring adventure.   blech!   Being open to new things and striving to live life to the fullest is very important to me, as I still firmly believe that life is essentially what you make out of your finite time in this world    and I believe that was a horrible run-on sentence that MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER  . I constantly try to learn something (both from good and bad   good and bad whats?  oysters?  ) and like to immerse myself into deep philosophical debates   in other words: I think I'm smarter than almost everyone   and generally connect well with those who crave for deep meanings of life and understand that there is more to life than making the ends meet from one peroid to another   in other words: I'm poor  . I am open minded and don't want to preclude anybody   I'd give this guy ten dollars if he could actually give me the definition of "preclude"  . I believe we all offer something to learn from each other in a certain way   for instance: I could teach this boy some grammar  . If you are looking for     an   adventurer with an eclectic range of interests and zest for life   as long as he's ZEST-fully clean  , I would love to hear from you. Thank you!    You're welcome!

						   Tomorrow is the first day of my last week as a 25-year-old.  I liked being 25.  It went by awfully quickly, though, and I feel like I missed most of it.  26 is freaking old.  I'm going to be in my late 20s soon.  Aren't I supposed to have more...stuff?  Houses and cars and beach-front property?  And...kids and all that jazz?  I don't feel old enough to be that old.  Not that 26 is old.  It is just older than I feel.  I feel 17.  That was a good age!  But then I'd be like  urlLink Doogie Howser  or something.  (Which, by the way, was just added to TVland's line-up)  What is the appropriate way to spend one's last week of 25-dom?  Any suggestions?  And what is the best way to usher in the onset of 26?  My plans right now consist of me singing Happy Birthday to myself.  With a cupcake.  And a candle.  And maybe a margarita.  Or a Diet Pepsi.

						   Ahh...the end of a three day weekend. How sad.  I went to Ohio!  I'd never really been before (besides the  urlLink Cincinnati airport ).  I was in Dayton visiting a friend who goes to  urlLink school  there.  Here is a short list of the things I did:  1. Saw three goats get their heads stuck in a fence (don't worry - we saved them!) and had some great  urlLink ice cream.   2. Saw  urlLink Supersize Me,  a very entertaining documentary about a guy who goes on a McDiet (all McDonald's, all the time).  I definitely recommend it.  The movie, not the diet.  3. Went on a bathroom shopping spree.  Think pink.  4. Threw my back out by sneezing.  5. Ate at  urlLink Skyline Chili,  an Ohio original.  6. Learned that the Wright brothers did all their work in Dayton, Ohio and merely used Kitty Hawk, NC as a good spot for wind.  Also saw bunches of neat old planes at the  urlLink United States Air Force Museum.   7. Saw  urlLink The Day After Tomorrow.   I love movies like this, even if they are formulaic (i.e. divorced couple realizes that they still really love each other when faced with a huge meteor/earthquake/ice age; rogue scientist gets to show that they were, indeed, correct in predicting the demolition of mankind; etc.)  8. Discovered that West Virginia is quite a beautiful state.  9. Ate a funnel cake.  I love funnel cakes...  10. Drove for a totoal of about 15 hours in three days.  Cool.  I love my truck.  It still doesn't have a good name, though.  I kind of call it "Silver," like the Lone Ranger's horse.  It is kind of boring, but does work...  My back hurts, and I'm tired and hungry, and this list was only going to be three things long, but then I get started, and can't stop!!!  I do have a pager again, in case there is anyone out there just dying to page me.    I'm leaving now.

						   I'm in psych right now, and since the #1 anxiety disorder is a Phobia, this seemed an appropiate list:  Alektorophobia: Fear of chickens Bogyphobia: Fear of bogeys or the bogeyman Coulrophobia: Fear of clowns Dendrophobia: Fear of trees Euphobia: Fear of hearing good news Frigophobia: Fear of cold or cold things Geniophobia: Fear of chins Homichlophobia: Fear of fog Isopterophobia: Fear of termites, insects that eat wood Japanophobia: Fear of Japanese Kosmikophobia: Fear of cosmic phenomenon Lutraphobia: Fear of otters Mnemophobia: Fear of memories Novercaphobia: Fear of your stepmother Ophthalmophobia: Fear of being stared at Paraskavedekatriaphobia: Fear of Friday the 13th Ranidaphobia: Fear of frogs Sciophobia: Fear of shadows Textophobia: Fear of certain fabrics Urophobia: Fear of urine or urinating Verbophobia: Fear of words Wiccaphobia: Fear of witches and witchcraft Xanthophobia: Fear of the color yellow or the word yellow Zemmiphobia: Fear of the great mole rat  I'm sorely disappointed that there is no "y" phobia. So I'll make one up: Yardophobia: fear of curly blonde hair. See more phobias  urlLink here.   My fear tonight is that I won't get to eat dinner. I'm on call with the grumpy resident, and we didn't really finish rounds until after 7, and I lost my Pocket PC with my credit card (I'm getting it back - another student found it and e-mailed me), so I have no money on me, and I don't think that she'd buy me dinner or give me the opportunity to run home to eat. Grrr. And I'm missing the only all-school party of the year that is worth going to.  Is it okay if I keep whining? I'm on the psych inpatient floor right now, so I may just fit in...

						   Yippee!!!&nbsp; This time, I'm in psych.&nbsp; It has been a relatively quiet night for psych.&nbsp; (As an interesting aside, I keep typing "psycho" instead of "psych."&nbsp; Freudian connotations anyone?)&nbsp;   My thoughts on psych so far: very, very different than medicine.&nbsp; My fellow partner-in-crime (i.e. the other student on consults with me) pointed out this morning that the residents on psych have a  personality. &nbsp; Not that the medicine residents don't, per se.&nbsp; It's just that they're so... stressed out most of the time, that they turn a bit robo-tronic.&nbsp; And I did not meet a single medicine intern in June (their last month of internship) who did not claim to be at the most cynical point of their entire life.&nbsp; Medicine just does that to you.&nbsp;   Not psychiatry, apparently.&nbsp; I have actually laughed - guffawed even - every day on psych so far.&nbsp; Everyone is basically pretty chill (well, okay, except one resident who is wound up really, really tight and talksreallyreallyfastsothatyoucanbarelyunderstandwhatsheissaying.&nbsp; She smokes.)  And the patients are different, too.&nbsp; We do see patients admitted to the medicine floors, since we are the Consult Team (remember the capes!)&nbsp; But the intereactions are different.&nbsp; No stethescopes, no 'where does it hurt.'&nbsp; We get to hear a lot of stories.&nbsp; I thought I'd heard some good stories on medicine, but these stories I've heard lately are much more... interesting, I guess.&nbsp; More hardships and craziness that people have gone through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all you have to do is say, "Hi, I'm so-and-so from psych" and they either 1. spill their guts or 2. claim they don't need psych and then proceed to spill their guts.&nbsp; Except for the one guy this morning who seemed convinced that Satan had sent us, and promptly tried to save us through Jesus Christ.&nbsp; But he was the exception.&nbsp;   I love the stories that I get to hear.  That all said and done, though... I am not a fan of psychiatry as a career choice.&nbsp; Yes, they're laid back and yes, the stories are great.&nbsp; But after you get that story, it is all med management.&nbsp; That's ALL it is.&nbsp; "How is that Xanax working for you, Mr. Anxious?"; "Are you able to sleep better with the Trazodone, Ms. Manic?"&nbsp; Gack.&nbsp; Me and medications do not mix in the first place, but then to have a specialty where that is really all that you do.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Not for me.&nbsp;  But I'll have fun for the remaining three weeks that I'm here!  Perhaps this is the consult team:   Power Rangers Movie!   urlLink   What movie Do you Belong in?(many different outcomes!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

Nothing much interesting going on nowadays.  Cruise in four weeks!&nbsp; Disney World before that!&nbsp; New York City before that!&nbsp; LOTS of working out at the Y before that!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yippee!&nbsp; I've become an official Y junkie.&nbsp; Now, when I am able to make it (being a super-hero psych consult person takes a long time) to the Y, I'm there for like 2 hours.&nbsp; Fun.

						   The Mysteriously Missing People Who Hate Me (MMPWHM) are supposed to be back on Monday when we start our psych rotation.  This terrifies me.  For psyche, we can call ahead of time to request what team we want to be on.  I thought about doing this, to try to ensure that I would not be on a team with MMPWHM.  But, I also was thinking that I should at least pretend to be an adult, and just let what happens happen...  Today, I joined forces with two non-MMPWHM and we decided to call to request things after all.  And guess what.  We had already been assigned.  And guess - just guess - who I was paired with??  Yup.  The biggest MMPWHM there is.  Awful.  Thankfully, we were able to pull a switch, and I will now be with a non-MMPWHM.  How horrendously awful a month with that person would have been is beyond me.  I'd have had a nervous breakdown, I just know it.  Because I still seem to be the only one of all of us involved that is affected by it.  I guess it is easier to dump a friend than to be the dumpee.  I feel like I narrowly missed death.  Question: how stable do you think a relationship is between a CCU nurse and a new second year resident that has existed for... less than 7 months, when she was (within the last year) previously dating a fellow?  Not that I'd try to break it up or anything...  I'm not the devil - I don't care what anyone says otherwise!!

						   I just found out that my ex-boyfriend is engaged!  I'm surprised, but not.  It has been almost two years after all.  (I'm amazed that time passes so quickly!)  I guess the most disturbing thing about all of this is that I've not really dated anybody since I broke up with him.  And he's engaged.  Granted, he needs to get married to maintain citizenship in this country...  I'm not dissing on him at all.  Part of the reason I ended it was because I knew he needed to get married, and I knew that it would not be to me.  He moved to the US as a young child, and because of stupid immigrant laws, had to be wed by 2005 (or something), or he'd have been sent back to his country of birth - whose language he isn't even fluent in any more.  I think that's just silly, but that is beside the point.  The point being that I have an ex that is getting married.  In a couple of weeks!  (He proposed officially this weekend, I guess...)  Just odd.  I feel like re-enacting the When Harry Met Sally scene, where she calls Harry and freaks out that her ex is getting married to "Kimberly."  (at least, I think it's Kimberly)  Except, I don't have a Harry, and I'm more like the Joe character in WHMS (i.e. I was the dumper, not the dumpee; and I was the one not looking to get married)  On a different note: I have seen three residents just get chewed out today.  Ahhh... the immunity of being a hapless, clueless third year med student!

						   Ever had one of those days?  A day where you walk around in a haze of confusion with an overwhelming feeling of stupidity?  If you're a med student, the answer to that question is more than likely yes.  (unless I'm totally wrong, and I'm the only one...)  I don't know what it is like for the general population at large.  Today started out okay.  I pre-rounded on my patients, got an H&P (history and physical) on the new patient admitted last night, went to morning report, and had all my notes ready when rounds started.  The bases were loaded and I was ready to bat.  I got to present the new patient right away, which usually is not a problem - in fact, there are times when I enjoy it.  It is where you get to tell the best story of the patient's entire hospitalization: why they are there! what sort of strange background led up to the problem at hand! what lab tests showed!  what phsyical exam maneuvers were just bizarre!  It can be a great time.  Unless your attending stands there staring at you, looking as if he will shoot lasers out of his laser-eyes into your nostrils, thru your ethmoid bone, into your frontal lobe for a modern day  urlLink lobotomy  to  urlLink ensure  that you never again form a full sentence, should you should happen to present anything incorrectly.  Anything.  Guess how well my presentation went this morning?  It hearkened back to my days in the CCU, where I was wont to refer to a female patient as "he" because I was just really, really confused.  Strike One.  I never even had the chance to redeem myself!  My second patient was whisked away to Neuro rehab, so I didn't really need to present that one.  Then we had to leave rounds early to go to lecture.  The timing usually doesn't work that way, except that our laser-eyed attending doesn't start rounds until 10 am, which is actually much more annoying than you'd think.  The lecture today was pretty interesting.  Very interesting, in fact.  Made more so by the fact that every time I opened my mouth to answer a question, I was 180 degrees away from the right answer.  But, hey.  At least I tried.  Ball One.  Lunch was uncomplicated.  Back on the floor.  My upper level kept wanting me to do things, and, even though I was willing, I felt...frantic.  I'm not sure why.  I don't think I can blame this one on myself... I have a feeling that the upper level himself was frantic, and that I was just getting the frantic aura.  I don't think I helped him much, though, as I kept doing things wrong.  And nurses kept asking me questions whose answers I did not know.  Strike Two.  As we approaced the time to leave, one of my patients came to me in a huff demanding to know something about their medical care.  This morning, the patient had been docile and sweet.  (remember yesterday?  my docile sweet patient who went crazy? Do I have this  urlLink effect  on people???)  I did not know what to tell the patient.  I'd seen them for a bit this morning, and that was it... and a lot of that was in the aftermath of my lobotomization.  ::Cut to scene of Brenna  making stuff up. ::    A few minutes later, I am asked to go speak to the family of yesterday's crazy patient.  Okay, remember when I said I had to leave rounds early?  This has happened EVERY DAY this week, and as a result, I've NEVER seen this patient with any docs.  It has all been me.  Alone.  Clueless.  This is the person they send to go reassure the family and allay their fears.  I KNOW NOTHING.    ::Cut to scene of Brenna  making stuff up. ::    But I sounded smart...  Balls Two and Three.  The bases are loaded, and I'm at full count.  I think I'll go home now.   urlLink Good stuff.

						   I feel as if I should write something, but I have nothing to say.  That is rare, actually.  The fact that I have nothing to say.  I usually have lots to say.  But today?  Nothing.  Huh.  I think I may go to the mall.  I haven't been there since April 2nd.  The day I took my boards.  Did you know that it is July?    I had a patient start yelling at me this afternoon for hiding her "bill" today.  (I think she was saying bill...I'm still not positive about that)  I was informed that if her bill showed up on television, that it would become  my  bill.  Also that I should stop pretending that I didn't know what damn bill she was talking about.    She knew that it was July.  Which I didn't.  Even though I fully understand that the reason I saw fireworks lighting up the night sky recently was in celebration of the union's 228th birthday and not because I was kissing my new-found soulmate.  Because I was not kissing anyone, soulmate or otherwise.  Question of the day: Isn't the concept of "soul-mate" somewhat boring?

						   I'm heinously tired.  Ha.  I don't know that I've ever used the word heinous before.  Definitely not in that context.  I missed dinner tonight, so please forgive me any... random bizarreness-osity.  Tonight, dear children, we have a study on different doctor's (or perhaps just males in general's) personalities.  It won't be a long lesson, or I'm likely to eat this plastic model of a brain sitting in front of me.  Mmmmm...I love me some cerebellum...  I was down in the ED (I'm on call tonight, and that is the cool place to be)  Guess who else was there?  No, wrong.  It was FNIB.  But, see...I didn't realize FNIB was there until at least 20 minutes had passed.  This was because FNIB was stuck in the shadow of a BJ.  Yes, folks, a BJ.  "What," you ponder queryingly, "is a BJ?"  Well.  Let me edu-mi-cate y'all.  A BJ is a "Beautiful Jerk."  This is a male that is quite objectively...  beautiful.   There is really no other description.  I despise the usage of "hot."  I like my sauce hot, and my coffee hot, but not people.  That just cheapens it.  But I digress.  Like Dr. Ober, which is why, I think, he's one of the coolest people I've ever had as a teacher.  However, he is not a BJ, and that is the subject of tonight's ramble.  BJ.  It does not matter his true identity, for all he will ever be is a BJ.  Objectively beautiful.  The jerk part is just something that you feel emanating off of some people.  He may be the nicest person in the world, but he will always be a BJ.  He just is.  So deal with it.  BJ swaggers around the ED.  He has no goal in mind.  I know, because I'm sitting there, doing nothing, and my eyes just naturally follow him.  That's part of the BJ-ness.  I watch him, even though he's basically just making laps around the ED.  FNIB wanders aimlessly around the ED.  He, also has no goal in mind, but this is obvious to absolutely everyone who even glances at him.  I try to watch what he's doing (because I'm still sitting there, doing nothing), but I keep losing him, even though he's basically just making laps around the ED.  As an aside - there is also a consumptive poet (male) wandering around the ED masquerading as a doctor.  I don't know where he came from, but if this guy does not stand in the moonlight serenading a beautiful woman standing on a balcony sometime in his life, there is something wrong with the world.  I may have more BJ vs. FNIB comparisons to make, but right now my mouth is full of neoprene basal ganglia.  Darn it all to hockey sticks.  FEED ME.

						   I am no longer allowed to purchase books, as of right now.  Finis.  And, I really hate it that my gut instinct is now to check Amazon to see if I can find a book cheaper than I can at  urlLink Powell's   I'm exercising my patience to an extreme degree today.

						   Today, I donned my white coat (ugly, boxy garment that it is) for the last time for two whole weeks!!  To add to that excitement, when I have  to weat it again, I get to wear scrubs underneath - legitamately, (ohmigosh - I have NO idea how to spell legitamately... legitamatly...legitimately...I dont' know! something must be wrong!) as I'll be on my surgery rotation.  We (my partner on the consult psych team and I) went to the VA outpatient clinic today to see one last psych eval.  Let me just take a minute to express my appreciation for all of the people willing to devote years of their life to serving the country in this way.  I'm admittedly not a huge fan of what the US is doing right now, but I am not nearly well enough informed to rant about it.  And I really think it is noble to join the armed forces.  I wish I had the guts to do the same!  I digress.   Actually, to digress would have necessitated a point in the first place.  I don't know that I had a point.  I did want to mention my current favorite psychological model/theory.   urlLink Learned Helplessness.   Seeing that my test is in a bit over an hour, I don't have time to expound on it...I just think it is really interesting.  If you put a rat (or, by extension, a child) in a position where it has no control, and keep shocking it (or punishing/beating/ridiculing), eventually that rat (or child) will learn 'helplessness.'  It gives up.  Stops eating, stops interacting with its fellow rat-friends.  It is a model of depression, that I think is fascinating.  But now, I need to study SSRIs.  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.  Do you realize how much Prozac changed the world???

						   My last night on call in psych.  Whoopee!  Though, since surgery is coming up next, I don't know exactly how thrilled I should be...  Eh, at least I don't have to take call for the next 2+ weeks.  Ain't no one gonna page me while I'm on a cruise ship, baby.  So.  I must vent for 20 seconds.  Maybe more.  The last time I was on call, I didn't get dinner.  The grumpy resident did buy me a bag of chips, which was really quite nice, but I still blamed her for my hunger.  Guess what?  Tonight, again, I am missing dinner.  And,  again , it is GR's fault!!  How could such a thing come about?  I'm glad you asked.  Well, actually, it isn't really all that interesting.  We saw that there were several psych consults down in the ED, she said, "aren't you on call?"  I (being between the rock and hard place of yore) said, "Um. Yeah."  Then she told me to go down to help him.  At which point, the nine year old that lives in my head started in  "you're not the boss of me!"   Unfortunately, I'm 26, and GR does get to grade me, and the attending was in support of the idea.  So I went.  Hungry.  Actually, I did stop by the cafeteria to grab a snack, so that I wouldn't be stuck at 8pm (when the caf closes) up the creek of yore without a paddle.  Of yore.  I'm totally on a modified version of the no carb diet for a week (no more than a week - I'd implode) before cruise-time.  Guess what?  There is no 'snack' sold in the cafeteria that is not made of extreme amounts of carbohydrates (with carb sprinkles)  So, I kinda had to break my diet.  Darn that GR.  I got some trail-mixy stuff from a bulk bin.  Lots of peanuts.  And rosemary or something.  AND goldwhales.  That's right - not  urlLink goldfish .  Goldwhales.  I thought that was interesting.  But then, I'm easily amused.  Much like the people of yore.  Anyway, I'm working with accented resident tonight.  He's actually eating dinner, but I had my goldwhales, and didn't feel like struggling to make accented small talk over a wilted salad, so I ran away to blog, blog, blog.  Now I have to go help admit a patient.  Grrr.  I don't think they did things like this in DOY (days of yore).  I wanna go...  Anybody gonna come along?

						   I really have nothing to say, but since it has been so long since I said anything, I thought that I'd sign on to say that I have nothing to say.  I'm going to New York this weekend!  I got my oil changed this past weekend.  Ummm.  I did my laundry.  And went shopping.  A week from tomrrow, I'll be in Charleston (followed by Orlando, Miami, then CRUISE!)  Then I come back and start surgery.  At that point, I'm sure I'll have a lot to say, but I'll be much too busy to say it.  I had an idea yesterday, but I forgot what it was...  I'm giving up carbs for a week.  I think this diet works simply because there is NOTHING TO EAT.  I went to the  urlLink state psychiatric hospital yesterday .  It looked like a college campus.  Suppose that's some sort of indication of college life?  That's all.

						   Every day deserves a good  urlLink insult .  But, no one insults like Shakespeare...:  Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine drunk, and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him.

						   I must admit that I did something...horrible today.  Almost unspeakable.  But, maybe I can absolve myself by admitting this to the internet at large.  ::Deep breath::  I went to the library (I know...it's awful...) and I looked up an article (wait, it gets worse) and I MADE a COPY for my ATTENDING.  ::Multiple thuds as bodies hit the floor after fainting in horror::  Yes, folks, I've wandered into the Land of the  urlLink Gunner.   I swore this day would never happen.  But I couldn't  help  it!  I was just really interested in this case we'd seen.  I know...feeble excuse for actually making a photocopy specifically for my attending...  I'll just have to make sure it doesn't happen again!  What could be so fascinating, I'm sure you are wondering, that would cause me to stray from the straight (and really quite wide) path of the semi-slacker?  Beer Drinker's Potomania.  Yup.  You read that right.  Beer. Drinker's.  urlLink Potomania.   Who knew?!?  We saw a patient yesterday who was admitted with a sodium level of 99.  Ninety-nine (bottles of beer on the wall...)  Normal is 140.  People with levels of less than 120 are usually in a coma or at least seizing.  This patient's was 99.  Lab error?  Nope.  Repeat level was 105.  Granted, the patient was somewhat delerious at first - apparently thinking they were on a game show at some point.  Anyway.  I'll spare you all the details.  :)    I'm on call!  This time with the very soft-spoken resident who I just  know  has a personality/sense of humor stashed somewhere behind his 1970's too big eyeglasses.  I've seen glimpses...  He (kind man that he is) let me eat.  Mmmm.  Food.  I got my dinner at the new  urlLink Einsten Bros.  bagel place that they opened a couple of weeks ago at the hospital.  Unfortunately, they seem to have had the screening question "Are you an idiot?" on the application and mistakenly only took people who checked the "yes" box.  Or maybe it wasn't a mistake.  Anyway...getting food there is always an adventure.  Now I'm watching  urlLink I Love the 80's  on VH1 and just chillin'.  Yeah.  Chillin'
