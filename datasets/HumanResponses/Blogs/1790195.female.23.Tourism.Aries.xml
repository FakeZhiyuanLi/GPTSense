      so let's talk about how ridiculous the last few days have been.  first of all, let me start with NB just because that's the boring part.  Did he call thursday night or friday morning?  Negative.  I got a few text messages from him this morning saying he was in Delaware with his brother and father and he claims he told me about it.  ok buddy, let's recap: you haven't talked to me in weeks, yeah sure.  i knew you were going to DE, i just "forgot."  when i referred to myself as his ex-gf, he proceeded to ask if he could call me.  LET'S SEE THAT IN SLOW MOTION: I'M YOUR   EX  GIRLFRIEND.  ok now onto the fun parts.  so yesterday was the big labor day picnic.  my entire morning was spent setting up outside, having it rain, setting up inside, hey it's sunny, setting up outside again.  basically i was food ticket nazi for three hours, and then i sold some 50/50 raffle tickets and skimmed some money off the top for myself.  hey momma needs a new pair of sneakers.  so 6 oclock comes around, someone offers me a margarita, and i'm like, ok i'm clocking out!  BADA BING!  8 hours later i've completed two power hours and smoked so much weed i can't even see.  all i know is that the night ended with me and gina wrestling Brian B. for his hat, and somehow we won because he's very ticklish.  i couldn't even move this morning.  and for some reason we decided we were all gonna meet the next morning for breakfast.  HI 9AM!  my bed called, it wants my fat ass back in it.  so we go to breakfast the basically the rest of my day was spent pooping and eating.  not in that particular order.  bam! it's 230.  ice cream social time!  my dad gets into a slight altercation with an intoxicated man.  oh and by slight, i mean my dad got spit at and then slapped, and oh yeah, state police arrested the other guy.  you know, just your ordinary day here at big bass lake.  have i mentioned that i'm leaving tomorrow?  HALLELUJAH!  so after the near beating, and me flying across the snackbar counter to kick someone's ass, i'm attempting to pack but it ain't working.  thoughts of power hours and naked hot tub are running through my head, and i must say, it's tempting.  did i mention i'll be back in NJ tomorrow?  yeah i didn't think so.  so basically i'm having a pretty good end to a shitty ass summer.  i'm single, i'm fat, and i'm shiny.  WHO WANTS ME!!!

      i'm tired.  very very tired.  if all goes according to plan, assuming i don't go home early in the next 3 days, or stay later, i will be putting 112.5 hours on my paycheck.  that's almost 60 hours a week for the past two weeks.  why you ask?  because i'm a glutton for punishment.  it's true.  speaking of bastards, the negro graced me with his presence today.  when i gave him attitude on the phone, he asked why.  i was like are you fucking serious.  WHY!  ok 1. i haven't talked to him since saturday and 2.  DID HE REALLY JUST ASK ME THAT QUESTION!??!  jesus christ i have the best fucking taste in men.    do i have a job yet?  UM NEGATIVE.  i'll be katmandu's newest day server in exactly one week, which means i'll be back to patty, anthony, and bitch allison all over again.  why you ask?  because i'm broke and i haven't been unemployed since i was 16 and i ain't starting now.  hopefully my tips pay for atleast one of my cell phones.  speaking of which, where should the loyals next vacation be?  beth said disney.  that's a negative.  the only ass you're getting around there is little boy ass and my name ain't r. kelly.  it's defintely gotta be somplace warm, where the beer flows like water, and the men flock like the salmon of capastrano.  a place called LAS VEGAS.  aaah vegas.  i looked at my pictures again and got nostalgic.  will i ever shut up about that trip?  probably not.  maybe after our next trip.  time to go, joe.  smell ya later.

      here's a flashback from the past.  the infamous message sarah left on my cell phone after our first night out in vegas.  not to be confused with our first night.  hehe.  Hey it’s Sarah, it’s 5am and when you come in the room I’m gonna beat the shit out of you both because it’s 5am and you’re missing in action.  Granted I just got in the room 15 minutes ago because I decided to eat Sicilian, no actually, I hooked up with a Sicilian man.  Who was pretty pretty hot and the man drought is over wooooooo and I’m gonna probably be thrown out of the hotel room because I’m speaking so loud.  Basically you’re hooking up with the hottest man in the entire milkyway right now and I’m sitting at home worrying about you because you’re probably gonna be pregnant with quintuplets upon arrival.  So maybe you could come home soon or atleast give me a call as to what is going on because if you don’t come home before um 8am, I’m gonna file a missing persons report.  And I’m pretty pissed off even though I’m pretty pretty drunk.  So basically me and Stacey are gonna have some lesbian sex to ease my pain.  So call me back cause I’m gonna kill you both.  Even though you’re having monkey monkey love (Stacey in background screaming GET OFF THE PHONE) with the hottest man I’ve ever seen.  But I’m still bitter and still upset, so call me back.  Be prepared to die when you get back to the room cause I’m gonna beat you both with ugly sticks.  Bye.

      as you all know, i have a close knit group of slutty friends called, "loyals," which stacey so skillfully named.  i've thought about you guys about oh....300000 times this summer and how i wished i was home hanging out with you guys, and i've decided that each and every one of you is good for a specific category of things.  so here goes:  beth.  if you want to go out and get retarded and then drive home, you call beth.  not only is she always in a good mood, but she's always ready to go out, meet people, and then have wild sex in their hotel rooms, much to sarah and stacey's dismay.  if you've got a test in the morning, she'll have you home by 1 at the earliest, otherwise always keep a change of clothes and a toothbrush in your car cause you never know where you're gonna end up.  so i've named her the "get drunk, hook up, and repeat" loyal.  then there's nia.  nia is my "freaknasty" loyal.  got sex stories?  go to nia cause she's probably already done it.  burning sensation?  nia's got it.  funky karma-sutra like position you wanna try?  she'll tell you how to do it.  she's a pro if ya know what i mean.  nia's position is a toss up though, she can also be known as the "slow" loyal.  got a joke?  don't tell nia cause she won't get it.  a couple days later you'll hear her giggling, ask her what she's laughing at, and she'll be like "i just got that joke you told a couple days ago."  by that point, i've already forgotten what the joke was even about.  then there's sarah.  sarah's my "bitch" loyal.  you got something or someone you wanna bitch about?  sarah will sit there and listen for hours and give the best advice.  OCD on the brain?  talk to sarah.  not only will she point out that whatever or whoever is bothering you is a complete moron, but she'll make you have AL in the process.  speaking of AL, stacey is my "fucking hilarious, don't leave home without depends," loyal.  you can't help but laugh till you soil yourself when stacey's around.  example:  sarah, we're in las vegas not HERSHEY PENNSYLVANIA.  yeah that one gets me everytime.  if you need some cheering up, or just feel like laughing till you gotta take a coma, defintely hang out with stacey, and don't leave home without depends.  second to last is jaime.  jaime is the "neutral, non bearing, hit on you when she's drunk" loyal.  watch out cause she gets frisky.  not only can you count on jaime to feel you up and attempt to make out with you when she's drunk, but she's also very non confrontational which is good at times.  if you're about to bash someone's face in, she'll make you calm down until the rage is just a small urge.  she's also very good at mediating problems between people, especially loyals vs. sigma.  DING DING DING! WE WIN!  last is marissa.  marissa is my "combination" loyal.  she's a mixture of everything listed above and more.  marissa is the best friend you'll ever make, the horniest friend you'll ever make, and basically she has enough sexual experience to write a book. (see i'm allowed to say this marissa, cause only people you know read it.)  she's not 21 yet folks, but come december 14th, she's bound to be hitting up every bar between new brunswick and trenton with the determination of me finishing a piece of cheesecake at an all you can eat buffet.   so there you have it.  though what i've said doesn't even begin to sum up even the worst qualities my friends possess, they mean the world to me, so i thought you'd enjoy reading about them.  but you can only read, cause they're mine!!

      hey look at that, it's been two days since i even signed on, and did i get any worthy e-mail? um negative.  so yesterday stace-diggity-dawg decided to visit mayberry and oh was it a grand time.  i knew she had big plans when she texted me at 10am and told me she was at the liquor store.  fo' shizzle dizzle.  so anyway, she finally gets her happy ass up here, we take a dashboard tour of "town" fill up some sprite cans with raspberry smirnoff, and head to the tennis courts.  basically we got drunk, sweaty, and then went swimming.  stacey didn't wanna get her hair wet, so i proceeded to dunk her.  bwahaha.  then we ate (of course) played some more tennis, packed it up and went home.  mom made taco salad for dinner and i ate until a button popped off my pants.  then we sat around like the pork tards we are, designing the apartment we're getting but can't afford.  i picked out plated with apples around the edges and decided my bedroom is gonna be a sex haven.  then we drank alot, and i passed out circa 10pm.  yes that's right folks, i'm a tremendous loser.  i regained consciousness long enough to see my brother put the others in the dvd player, but then passed out again.  then we both went to sleep...oh wait, not before stacey pulled a retarded and fell out of her fucking bed.  it was classic.  hahahaha.  i'm still giggling about it.  yeah so we both sleep till 10:45.  that's the latest i've slept in oh....six months maybe?  too bad i didn't sleep all day because i got a lovely phone call from tim around 11 saying gina and sarah decided they weren't gonna come into work.  so yeah, my 8 hour day turned into a 12 hour day.  before i went over to the pool i paid the GM a visit and bitched about how shitty the summer has been, so hopefully i'll get paid what i deserve for the rest of the summer, even though there's only 11 days left.  so what's up with NB you ask?  i would hardly know.  I know his dumbass fell off his roof today and he went to the emergency room.  Bruised ribs and a sprained wrist.  I guess that kills his jerking off plans for a few weeks.  Sucks to be him.  He asked me what he has to do to get me back into his life.  I don't have an answer for him.  I don't know if there's something specific, but I know I still need more time.  I'm trying to put my life back together and I'm not sure if he fits into the puzzle.  Milton's service was today finally, unfortunately I couldn't go.  I'm still bothered by this whole thing, maybe because I've never know someone who's committed suicide.    Anyways, that's all I got for today.  Gotta be back at work in ohhh...7 hours.  Shoot me.

      another day has passed and has my life gotten any better?  not really.  i finally got the phone call i had been waiting for from NB at 3:15am.  Yeah Dave, cause that's gonna smooth things over.  Wake my ass up 5 hours before I have to be into work.  Fan fucking tastic.  Basically I told him I didn't want to see him anymore, and he whimpered, pleading, and whined like a 4 year old child.  At first I had thought he passed the phone over to DJ, but I was sadly mistaken.  I told him that if he wants me in his life, he's gonna have to earn my presence.  So what did NB do today?  Called me 5 times and sent me about ohhh....10 text messages.  Hi, attention is not something I'm used to from him and it's kinda spooky.  Parents are still trying to get me and Tom Payne (Penis McLarge for short) together.  He was jonesing today for another session, especially after I told him I'd only given him a taste of what I can do.  When he said, "next time..." I yelled "when's that!??!" before I could catch myself.  After a brief moment of embarrassment i just put on my winning smile and went about my day.  He's definitely a magnum kind of guy...might have to go to CVS before Sunday...  Oh yeah, on the NB front, he also got that super secret FBI/CIA/FUCK job that they kidnapped him for.  I told him i truly believe he was being anally probed by ET, then he reminded me that he's an Exit Only kinda guy.  I told him I was too and he got even more cranky.  Sorry bub, at this point you're gonna be lucky if I don't deflect and stick it in an electrical socket.  Yeah homey ain't gettin shit when he comes up here.  Besides, I wanna stay fresh for Penis McLarge.  Speaking of McLarge, Stacey and her gigantic breasts are coming up here tomorrow and basically we're gonna tear shit up.  I can't say what we're doing, but tune into the 11pm news for an update because basically we're gonna be arressted.  She said she's bringing her camera to "document the night," which can only mean trouble.  hehehe....hehehehhe.  So I updated my hook up list post-Penis McLarge and found that in 10 years I've kissed 28 guys.  Six since April.  Is that a lot or a little?  I feel like Bridget Jones' Diary.  I've definitely got the fat for it.  Granted she only jonesed after her boss.  Oh wait....shit I caught myself.  I think the most memorable "relationship" I had in the past year was with Mr. Jamey "Shit head" Johnson.  I broke world records by hooking up with a co-worker after I'd only been employed at KatManDu for two days, but I definitely chose quantity over quality with that boy.  And there definitely wasn't all that much of him if you know what I mean....  Anyway, put the children to bed and warn the neighbors, Stacey's coming to town and shit ain't gonna be pretty.  She can meet Penis McLarge and hook shit up...for me not for her.  Ohhhh that would be a cat fight.  A shaven cat fight.  Hehehhee.  Just for you stace!! GET READY TO BUTT HUMP!!!

      my life is completely in shambles right now, luckily i have a sense of humor and can therefore joke about my pathetic existence.  so what happened yesterday?  oh that's right, NB said he would call me in the morning and let me know if he was coming up here.  1130 rolled around, i called, i yelled, he yelled back, and said he'd call me in about an hour.  well it's been 30 hours folks, and here's my new scenario:  he was abducted again, this time by kidnappers who are holding him randsom.  unfortunately, his phone battery wasn't charged and he couldn't call anyone he knew to tell them what had happened (especially his loving cough  > cough girlfriend.  that'd be me.  so anyway, the robbers soon realize, this poor fucker doesn't have any money, what the fuck.  so they wait, and wait, and BAM!! it's today.  they feel bad for the poor fucker and let him charge his phone.  how do i know?  well i don't, but yesterday it went straight to voicemail and today, it rings.  VOILA!  but anyway, so they start calling me, but from their super secret private phone number that only they know about.  they've called 5 times, but me being the smart girl that i am, left my phone at home today.  why you ask?  because if i didn't i would've OCDed and called dave about 47 times.  But alas, i've only called twice.  (I came home for lunch, too tempting).  I'm proud of myself.  So anyway, that's my new story, and I'm sticking to it.  Bitter you ask?  Not so much, concentrating on more important things.  So does anyone have a job for me?  Besides personal vag fingerer, I haven't gotten any offers.  Have i tried?  Not really.  Guess that's my problem, I lack motivation.  I'm being set up by some of the parents at work.  They're arranging a date for me and Tom on saturday because "it's my last chance."  Little do they know...hehehhee.  Gabrielle, the girl who went through my staff door, she had to go back and get more stitches.  I saw her today and cried.  Guilt is a funny thing.  I heard that Milton's family doesn't even have enough money to give him a proper funeral.  It still tears me up that he called me a few days before he hung himself...was I supposed to realize that something was wrong?  I've been asking myself that for two days, and I still can't find the right answer...  That's it for now.  But here's something funny from Nia to cheer up your day: "Yeah my boyfriend won't have sex with me.  Stephanie said it's something about him having morals.  I didn't understand."  That's right folks, we're all a buncha whores.  Speaking of whores, how's your mom?

Especially my loyals, Beth Nia Sarah Stacey Jaime Marissa.  I love you guys!!

       Let's recount my day from hell...   So the day started off good.  I didn't have to be in till 10:30, i got to sleep till 8:45.  Everything's just peachy.  Then is started to rain.  Day gets better.  I get to sit on my ass and get paid to do nothing.  Well one of my favorite kids Gabrielle, is hanging out while her parents are upstairs in a meeting.  She decides she's going to come into the staff room, I say no and begin the close the door, she pushes on glass, she goes through glass.  Glass shatters everywhere, including all over me.  Well 20 minutes later, she's off to the emergency room to see a plastic surgeon, and i'm picking shards of glass out of my foot.  It's pretty disgusting when you can't tell if the blood on your leg is your own, or someone else's.  Then NB calls.  Well la-dee-freakin-da.  Three days later, he decides he's going to grace me with his prescence.  Here's how the conversation went:  NB: Hello? Me: What do you want? NB:  Uhh...hi.  How are you? Me:  Well let's see, a little girl just went through my staff door, and I have glass sticking out of my foot, but how are you doing dave? NB: Ok you're busy.  Call me back later? Me:  Jesus fucking christ.  And from there it went.  And it went, and went, and went.  So you would think I would know what he was doing for two days right?  WRONG.     I know everyone thinks I'm an asshole for putting up with him, and for not giving him the boot today, but I can't.  I think some of you understand.  But as miserable as I am right now, he honestly sounded sincere on the phone.  And I made it clear that this is his last chance.  So I hope he doesn't take my threats lightly.  But now for the more important question: Do I tell him about my infidelities with the tennis pro?  I think not.

      hey guys, so i decided to be a loser like sarah and make myself a journal.  but i thought hey, my adventures with my craptastic boyfriend are humorous and everyone should be allowed to share in my misery.  so here's today's adventure:  well let's start with yesterday, first of all, NB (that's his code name, few will understand) says that he's gonna come up to mayberry.  so i'm like cool just call me in the AM, which should've been around 9.  11:45 rolls around and i get a 6 part text messaging series that says he's not coming, he's talking ot his "uncle" and basically breaks things off...or so i thought.  so this morning after calling the bastard 24 dozen times, he answers and says he can't tell me what he's doing or where he is, but he needs to talk to me about this "job" they've kidnapped him for and he's gonna come up today.  this was 11:09am.  well it's 5:41 people and NB has yet to get in contact with me.  he was supposedly done with this interviewing shit at 1.  so basically i've come up with two dramatic tales that could fit this situation.  here's the first: he's been kidnapped and shipped to australia by aliens.  they've anally probed him and he's now enjoying a hot cup of tea with ET and the coneheads as they plot to take over the world.  they've gotten such information from a published book "how to take over the world for dummies" written by dr. evil.  little do they know that austin powers is headed their way in a big boy and i, his sexy sidekick Ima Cumin' (courtesy of Sarey) plan on tying him down and allowing NB to probe me.    here's the second tale:  NB is a well known bullshit artist and this is just his latest installment in his popular book, "Bullshit Fairytales."   This people, is my craptastic life.  Thankfully NB doesn't know how to use the internet, so I can bitch all i want, and only a select few can read.  I'll keep you posted on this neverending story of cheating, lying, deceit, and fantastic sex.

      so last night i went out with leverne (joe) lenny (stacey) and shirley (kevin).  at first, kevin and stacey were forcing me, but by the time i drank my first beer at the pub, i was relaxed.  we drank some more, had a shot of jager, bickered over the names, "nancy," and "gertrude." and then went to the movies.  kevin had his hands on my woman, so i slapped him a couple times, and then he started rubbing on me.  when i rubbed back i think he got nervous and went back to stacey.  hehe.  so anyways, we all know our affection towards parking lots, so it was fitting that joe finally made his move when we were standing by the side of stacey's car.  mmmm dadddy liiiiiiiiiiiiiiike.  good times were had by all, and next time leverne says we have to go to the "truck stop, or grease traps, or truck tracks, or whatever the hell it is."  but here's his quote of the night:  joe:  it's cold as hell out here! stacey: PUSSY!! (bwahaha, stacey thinks she has him here) joe: yeah well, i am what i eat! ::fits of convulsion follow from all::  that's my future baby daddy folks!

      when the parents are away, the mice will play!!    well not really, if you imagine the worst possible things me and brian could stir up to do while mom and dad are in the poconos, we haven't even come close.  let's see i stayed online for more that 45 minutes...and i was in the shower for more than 5.  and nia and stacey slept over.  that's about all the rule breaking i've done!! brian threatened to take the new beemer out and i almost had a coronary.  thankfully he didn't....atleast not yet.  thursday i actually made it to the gym!! go me! go me! i stayed on the crosstrainer for 60 minutes, it was great.  friends sucked, but atleast it kept me at the gym for more than an hour.  i went again yesterday, but my explosive ass required that i return home immediately.  and i went again today.  but i embarrassed myself.  i was in the weights section working on my arms and there were these two hotties next to me talking about baseball.  so i gracefully try to exit my machine, trip over the leg assist and fall into the mirrors in front of me.  i have a nice mark on my shin to prove it.  i hung my head in shame and walked away.  they asked if i was alright, but i couldn't even muster up the courage to say yes.  other than that nothing much is going on.  me and dave are in a constant fight, and one of these days i might just stop talking to him, but i don't think that day will come any time soon.  who knows though, cause stacey and kevin are working on hooking me up with jw.  supposedly he thinks i'm hot...he must be wearing his beer goggles.  anyways, that's all.  i'm gonna go ice my shin and get ready for the beer bee que.  woohoo!

      so i've been telling myself all week that i'm gonna go to the gym on my way home from work.  yeah i've had the same gym clothes on my front seat since monday.  but tonite's the night people!  i'm going during friends. and with my individual tv, people will turn and stare as a snort and laugh so hard i trip and crack my skull open.  it will be fun.  speaking of fun, last night me marissa stacey and nia went to the movies.  but what would the movies be without liquor?  so i stopped at the store and picked up three 4 packs of mudslides and watermelon spike.  yeah so 20 minutes into the movie, all the bottles are empty, and we're all hammered.  good thing because the movie fucking sucked.  don't go see cabin fever!  so it's about 10 minutes before the movie's about to end and stacye has to pee so bad she's like crouched down with her legs crossed.  well she finally couldn't take it (we know the bladder issues stacey has) and crawls across the three of us to get to the aisle.  that's all fine and good, but as she's crawling/stumbling towards the stairs, she manages to knock over every bottle along the way.  it went something like this ::clink clink laugh clink snort clink clink hehehe clink::  she even managed to knock the bottle that was in the cup holder, out and down a few rows.  stupid retarded.  then we went to dinner and i had a mojito.  mmmmmm mojito.  work sucked today and it sucked yesterday.  it's officially pick on jen week.  just don't ask about the indentured servants...

      Hi, My Name's Dave, And I'm a ButtMunch-A-holic.    So as I'm driving into work, NB calls and gives me his pathetic excuses about why he didn't call me Saturday Night or yesterday at all.  So I'm tooling around at work, and I come back from the kitchen and Nia goes, "uhhh...Dave's here." and Lo and behold that focker is sitting in my section with some other dude.  So of course he requests to sit in my section, which is fine, and they get two sodas and their food.  So I ask Joe Surdo if we can do anything with his check, you know discount it or just comp it and Surdo says yeah don't worry about it, I'll comp it.  So I print out a little piece of paper and write "it's on the house," on it, and shove it in a checkbook and leave it at his table.  So he smiles and says thank you and I walk back into the kitchen and he leaves.  So I walk back, bus his table, and grab the checkbook.  I open it, AND THERE'S 5 DOLLARS IN IT!!   THE CHEAP ASS BASTARD!   HE GOT A FREE MEAL, AND I'M HIS GIRLFRIEND, AND HE LEAVES 5 DOLLARS.   I was livid.  Here is Stacey's original joke:  What does a bird say when he flys over Dave?  CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP!  So the rest of the day sucked, I had 4 tables including Dave's and I made 19 dollars.  I was promptly cut at 1:30 and I hauled ass home.  I'm gonna take a nap soon.  I have off tomorrow because I have an interview at St. Peter's, so wish me luck.  On that note, here's Weldon's quote of the day, and then I'm out.  Stacey:  I have scabies, but only on the weekends. Weldon: Well next time you have it, you call me, and I'll come scratch it for you. Me: OH GOD, I'M GOING HOME!

      so it's been a few days but nothing too exciting has been going on.  tuesday and wednesday were by far the busiest lunches ever.  on wednesday there was a baby shower in my section and let me tell you if those balloons blew in my face one more time i was about to pop them and the pregnant woman they rode in on.  wednesday night i ventured back to kat with thompson, manny, chris, nia, rick, ope, nicks, mike w, and others.  and then ::dun dun dun:: NB shows up.  yeah it only took him 20 minutes to come say hi...thanks hon! yesterday when i was on the phone with him i was like, "listen if you come in next week, can you do me a favor and say hi to me when you walk in?"  his excuse was like oh well i uh didn't see you cause uh you were sitting behind joe and uh no offense but he's a big guy.  FUCK YOU.  so then me and NB went over to savoys to say hi to Lamar since he was DJing.  This week those fools and their psychotic sister weren't there though.  Speaking of which Jamey was outside Kat last night during happy hour.  He dropped something off from Bruce and then peeled outta there.  Luckily I was at the hostess stand to witness this.  Like I could forget that minivan...IT HAD RACING STRIPES!!  Yeah yesterday I worked a double and it definitely wasn't worth it.  Let's talk about my last table so sat there making out.  Every chance I got I shoved something in between them.  I made as much money working a double yesterday as I did on Tuesday in 4 hours.  That shit ain't cool.  But Stacey made her comeback last night and when I saw her I immediately wanted to bend her over and spank her with a baguette.  I'm sure Weldon did too.  We were annoying JW while he was eating and he doesn't even recall the altercation last week at Savoys but he goes, "Yeah we definitely have to do that again...ha ha."  No shit sherlock, I'm sure the spontaneous orgy solidified the fact that we will be going to Savoys every Wednesday until we're 60.  Not much else going on folks.  My parents are going away next week.  I'm thinking about having a par-tay.  But I bet it's not a party if I'm calling it a par-tay.  We can bar-be-que!  I also invited NB to stay over.  Wink wink nod nod HUMP HUMP.  Btw, we christened my car.  BADA BING!    Ok time to showa.  I'm hostessing tonite and I have to make a good first impression on our customers.  Hi ::poot:: welcome to ::poot:: KatManDu ::poot:: TRY THE CHILI!

      yeah so the last two days at kat have been the days from hell.  let's see yesterday i had an 11 table section, and come 12-12:30, that entire section was filled with demanding bitchy ass people.  it didn't even matter if i was the hammer or not cause my ass didn't leave until 4 anyways.  i made 101 dollars after tip outs though so my ass ain't complaining.  the highlight of my shift was when i blacked out.  yeah...nothing a little pink lemonade can't cure.    so then today i was like whew, it won't be as busy as yesterday.  i should've known the day was doomed from the start when NB walked in the front door.  I almost dropped the 7 pitchers i was carrying.  it was an awkward hello and an even more awkward goodbye.  i think he's coming out with us tonite too, so we'll see how that goes.  it's not gonna be pretty.  then i found out i had a 16 top.  oh yeah, that on top of all my other tables, which didn't turn out to be too many.  luckily today i didn't black out, no one's food got lost, and i didn't forget to ring in any orders.  I'm a good waitress i swear.  So today I only brought home 86 dollars.  But if you consider the 30 dollars I made everyday last week, it's a vast improvement.  So anyways, we're venturing back to Savoys tonite minus Stacey Kevin JW and possible Rick.  But we're adding on NB.  So basically it's just gonna be me nia thompson and dave.  that should be interesting...NOT.  we'll see if debbie and her scummy ass sisters are there, and if they are, we're gonna beat their asses.    Time to go, joe.  Talk to you later.

      today has been one of the most boring days of my life.  i've decided that i don't like having days off, so i'm gonna try my best not to experience this pain again.  i'm watching best of the best, america's funniest home videos and i don't think i've ever laughed so hard in my life.  i attribute that to sheer boredom, but they've still shown some funny shit.  i was watching infomercials, you know, mouthing along with the RonCO rotisserator ad, and up came an inappropriate ad.  here's how it went.  it asked you to donate money to send jews back to israel.  i thought that's what emmigration was for.  for only 1400 dollars you can send 4 jews back to isreal.  i wonder what i'd have to give to send sarah back.  she's one expensive jap.  i officially told NB that i'm seeing other people.  he wasn't too happy, he almost hung up the phone and we know what affliction he has with that.  so yeah, i'm officially single.  well not really single he made sure to say that i'm going to be dating others while mainly dating him.  suuuuure, whatever oyu say buddy.  too bad i haven't seen you in 2 months.    anyway, time to go back to afv and tom bergeron...soooo hot, want to touch the heiiinie.

      so let's recap now that my brain cells are somewhat functioning although still under the influence of alcohol.  wednesday night: it was interesting to say the very very least.  it definitely goes down as the greatest night of my life thus far.  the debbie quasi-fight was just humorous and only makes me want to "smile" at her more.  it's even funnier that she's like 40, she has 5 kids, yet she's still stalking a group of 22 year olds because of something that happened almost a year ago.  hi anne klein called, they want you back in the ugly ward.  what occured in the parking lot is still baffling to me.  had it not been for stacey and her loud ass, we probably wouldn't have had such a good time.  alls i gots to say is "jingle jingle jingle....jinglejingle."  last night:  quite interesting as well.  it comes in handy to know the security guards when shady men are trying to mack it to you, and you have the power to just signal and have them thrown out.  especially after nia screamed "WE'RE LESBIAN LOVERS!!" and he still didn't take a hint....or a breath mint.  haha, that rhymed.  anywho, we ate dinner and then harrassed stacey at cactus bar.  it was a dicey ride home to say the least.  things i've learned this past week: 1.  sometimes it takes the kitchen 1/2 an hour to sell me a ticket that consists of chips and salsa, and a fucking french onion soup. 2.  savoys on wednesday nights is now a tradition.  parking lot shenanigans are a must. 3.  pedicures are a gift sent by god. 4.  never leave your dinner plate unattended.  especially when you're not done and have 1/4 of a strip steak left. 5.  even when i'm just drinking a martini, i still can't help but spill it. 6.  announcing that you're a lesbian to get rid of a butt ass ugly man, only turns him on more. 7.  i can successfully snuggle with xander without having an allergic reaction. 8.  i'm a loser.  goodnight.

      for recent transpirings in my life, please refer to:  www.stacedawg.blogspot.com  I'm still hungover from last night and do not have the brain cells to write my own entry.  Ignore the ID questioning because I didn't get hassled.  And oh yeah, I had double shots for Stacey's single shots.  And replace those Jager and RedBulls with lots and lots of Miller Lites.  Oh and the Coors Light I chugged compliments of Rick after we got into the fight.

      so KatManDu sucks.  end of sentence, that's alls i gots to say about that.  the negro sucks as well. he's in DC right now doing his top secret stuff.  do i care? well not really.  he invited me to his "swearing in" ceremony he assumes they're having.  i guess i'll go.  it's the decent thing to do. i was looking at ope's pictures and came across one of NB and karen the server.  daddy did not like at all.  so after i got home, i went to NYSC and joined.  i walked around for a little bit just to look around, and you know what i found.  INDIVIDUAL TVS.  each machine has it's own tv!!  do you know what this means!??!  i'm never leaving!!  which is guess is a good thing because i need to lose about 30lbs.  DIET STARTS TOMORROW!  so anyways, that's it for now, mr. chow.  smell ya.  p.s. anyone want a hamster?  fancy dwarf, only weighs a few ounces, bits on occassion.  mouse like.  really, he's a sweetheart.  TAKE HIM GODDAMMIT!

      i'm motherfucking tired.  anyway, here's a short recap of the past few days.  since i'm perma-dayserver, friday morning was spent at katmandu.  lunch was fucking ridiculous and i was once again reminded that i'm out of shape.  my arm still hurts :(  so i go tanning, and go home, and wait for NB to come over.  he says he'll be there around 9.  7:30: "hey jen i'm still at the airport, i'll let you know when i'm done."  8:30: "jen i should be leaving in about 10 minutes or as soon as my instructor shuts up."  yeah that was the last i heard from him until yesterday around 2pm.  "hey jen, sorry i missed you.   I'M IN BALTIMORE.  I'd love to see or talk to you tonite."  DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH BUDDY!!  I promised myself I wouldn't talk/text him until atleast monday when i'm done serving, going to the gym, and tanning.  So far so good.  He only sent me three text messages yesterday, all of them nasty, none of them with a concerned tone at all.  He's such a wonderful human being.  >  So yesterday I covered Piglet's shift, and that'll never happen again!  I was there until 5:30.  FIVE THIRTY!!  I made 93 dollars off lunch, but of course i had to tip out 27.  this fucking sucks.  i hate the new tipping method.  anywho, so since i couldn't go home and get ready, i just changed in the bathroom.  Then me and Thompson went into Philly and ate at Uno's and went to Jillians.  Actually first we went to Boscovs and THompson tried to buy a golfbag but they said it was a prop and not for sale.  WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A PROP THAT YOU DON'T SELL!??!  YOU'RE A FUCKING DEPT. STORE!!  So after unsuccessfully trying to smuggle it down my shirt, we went to Jillians.  Thompson killed some guys on the video games, and then it was time for bowling!!  I WHOOPED HIM!!  Then we went into the club in there...yeah that was scary.  It was like driving down Cass St. listening to Coldplay.  Oh wait..I did that on Friday.  yeah homey almost got shot!  Then we went back to the parking lot.  Aahhh the parking lot how I missed thee.  :)  So my hamster just bit me and I'm bleeding.  Time for first aid, Kincaid.

      so today was my first day back at katmandu after almost four months away.  the highlight of my day was when jeff w. asked me for something, stopped in the middle of his sentence because he realized i was back, and then said "what the fuck's up sweetie!??!"  it was humorous when he asked me how dudley was, and said tell him to fucking call me.  good luck with that buddy, he doesn't even call me.  i forgot how much work it is to serve.  first of all, i have no idea where anything is anymore.  second, i'm out of shape.  carrying trays, running around, walking all over the place...it's hard work.  luckily i took a coma in the tanning bed and all was forgotten :)  anyway, time for a nap, jap.  talk to you later.

      guess who's back? back again! jenny's back! TELL THE BARTEND(ER)!!!  yeah so i'm back in north brunswick.  it only took me 2.5 hours, the hamster cage toppling, and a few phone calls to get here.  i spent my first day lying on my ass, eating everything i could get my hands on, and "unpacking."  yeah that's my code name for doing absolutely nothing.  NB decided to be decent yesterday and sent me quite a few text msgs.  he even called later.  be still my heart.  we talked for a couple mins, but that was it.  i asked him if he wanted to do something (meaning me) friday night, but he's not sure yet.  i thought he was being decent until today when he told me that he told his boss that we've broken up and we have no plans of living together in the next 18 months.  he paints a pretty picture doesn't he?  so instead of getting anything accomplished today i did nothing.  so now tomorrows schedules consists of joining the gym, getting a pedicure with sarah, picking up my shirts from kat, getting the oil changed in my car, finding black shorts and pants, and numerous other tedious tasks.  oh yeah and marissa's dropping me off an application for the hospital.  they'll hire me won't they?  i bet it doesn't help that i still haven't started to pay my bill for the incident that occured on my 21st birthday.  i find myself giggling a lot these days.  today i was driving back from the bank, and thought about stacey falling outta the bed next to me, and i damn near drove off the road.  and then sarah said:   SJBenKim (5:49:56 PM): THEEEEEEEE CHEEEEEEESE STAAAAAAAAANDS ALLOOOOONNNNEEEE  and i thought about the last kmd employee party, the insane amount of shots i did that night, and nia's impersonation of stacey giving head.  that alone caused AL.  so basically i'm looking forward to my day shifts at kat because me nia and stace are perma-server and we're gonna walk around slapping each others asses, grabbing each others boobs, and basically doing everything but rubbing each other's vags, all for weldon's enjoyment.  that's all, sol.  smell ya.

      it's funny how your life can fall apart in a matter of minutes.  it's funny how even though people know the dangers of things, they do it anyway for a quick high.  and i think it's particularly funny that doing said dangerous thing will lead even the most honest and loyal people betray those they love most.

      all day i've been walking around thinking it's monday. it's kinda wierd and i keep confusing myself.  i dunno how that's different from any other day, but i felt like sharing.  this is a pretty boring beginning to my blog entry, but suck it up.  i'm a hilarious person.  speaking of me being funny, i was recounting our experience at macaroni grill last thursday, and i thought i should add this for everyone to enjoy:  marissa: jen, you're so fucking funny. me: i know, i really am. sarah: alright well stop picking on me, i feel like i'm in 2nd grade. me: well if this was 2nd grade you'd be eating by yourself!! (everyone convulses) me: wow, i really am funny!! sarah: SHUT UP JEN!!  bwahaha.  oh man i crack myself up.  speaking of crack, it's another underwear free day. i dunno why i felt the need to share.  ok let's recap the last few days.  saturday was oktoberfest at kat.  i froze my butt off at the hostess stand, and then clocked out and got silly!!  me, thompson, and tony spent some quality time together at main bar, and then we ditched tony and me and thompson spent some quality time all over the place.  if you wish to hear details, inquire via email at j_noronha@hotmail.com.  i'm bored and will respond promptly.  sunday i worked brunch which was lucrative because beth's parents spent all day drinking bloody marys in my section and mike davis came in with his sister.  soooo hot, want to touch the heinie.  he left a 25 dollar tip, but i would've rathered his penis tip.  bwaahah.  sunday night was katmanboo which sucked for the most part.  it rained and there weren't as many people there as last year.  but i had fun with nia and thompson and picking on kevin.  hehe, i pick because i love people.  if i didn't make fun of you, that means i don't like you.  yesterday i spent all day in training and hanging out at beth's with the cats.  we spent some quality time together eating and cuddling.  hee hee.    that is all paul.  man i wish i knew a paul.  and i wish he was hot.  and he had a large penis.  and well...the rest is only suitable for adult films.     urlLink ')"> getCount(' ')

      it's my 3rd day in my new office and i'm already slacking and buttfucking around the net while on the clock.  tcnj grads = slackers.  what can i say.  so i really like it here.  all the women seem nice and it's a pretty cool job.  i sit on my ass all day reading travel brochures planning my impending vacation and then i realize i'm fucking broke and i fake sob.    thanks sarah for posting my private ass information on the web for all to view.  it's not my fault if i have tempermental intestines.  though it's nice that i have a regularly scheduled ass explosion every morning as soon as i step foot in my office.  i think my ass can smell the fear and nervousnes.  though everytime i walk in i'm greeted with applause and appraise because supposedly the last girl that was hired for my job went to lunch and never came back.  so on my first day they made sure that when i went to eat, i left my car keys at the desk :) :) :)   i love these ladies.  what else is going on? hrmm well i find it humorous that everybody has somebody but me.  oh wait, not humorous so much as MILDLY DEPRESSING!!!  i'm really really unhappy as of now on that front.  i ended thing's with NB permanently though i haven't heard anything from him for a few days, even a few before the actually ending date.  so i really have no idea what's going on with that, but i honestly don't care because it's over.  right?? right?????  RIGHT!!  next week i'm working 60 hours...woah is me!!  hopefully i'll make some decent money cause the bills are due and homegirl is broke!!  homegirl is also fat.  i don't think it was wise for me to take a job where my main responsibility is sitting on my tuckus.  is that how you spell that??  dinner last night with sarah, marissa, and nia was interesting.  sarah got loopy after a glass of wine.  oh wait, sarah's always loopy.  she also had food all over her face.  oh wait she's always like that.  that's why i love that horny jew.    that's all for now.

      so what's been going on with little ole me...  WELL I OFFICIALLY HAVE A JOB!!  Today I peed in the cup, and tomorrow is my first day of training in my office.  MY office....Hi, welcome to MY office.  That's the most wonderful sound in the world...well besides, "Hi welcome to Burger King, may I take your order?"  The pay kinda sucks but the benefits are awesome.  I already started looking at Rutgers Grad School since AAA will be footing the bill.  Oh yes they'll also be paying for any AAA trips I take, they'll refund commission on any other trips I go on, and oh yeah, at the end of the year, I get kicked an extra pay check.  Did I mention the 22 PAID days off??  And the free AAA plus membership of course.  I'm super excited, I might just soil myself tomorrow.  That's why I'm packing an extra change of clothes.  :)  Other than that nothing much is going on.  I'm not allowed to discuss the details of me and Stacey's road trip today, but let me tell you that we didn't get lost, it was Mapquest's fault.  Oh yeah and tomorrow I have to call out for the first time ever...I'm disappointed in myself, but what can I do...  Smell ya.

       LONG ASS WEEKEND   Last night I picked up a hostessing shift because the girl Jessica stopped showing up.  There was a private party so we were closed to the public, so I figured hey this'll be easy money.  Answer the phones and make fun of the sluts, no big deal.  First of all,  I had to give direction to Kat from Route 1 about 3950282 times.  Then I got the, "I'm lost on McSuckaTit Road."  WHY THE HELL DID YOU TURN OFF ROUTE 1 JACKASS?  "Well I got off 29 onto..."  WE'RE RIGHT ON 29 FUCKFACE!!  As you can see, my rage was turned up last night.  So being the hard worker I am, since I got kicked out of the hostess stand by chaperone bitches, I asked if they wanted me to do coat room.  FUN FUN NOT!  Let's see, 700 high school kids, 50 degress outside, I was fucked.  There were coats everywhere.  Then they came back asking for shit.  I was like, "I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHERE YOUR COAT IS!!"  I honestly didn't.  We were just making up numbers and throwing shit around, we hadn't organized everything yet.  Then the drunk kid got in my face and I called a code grey.  Yeah he was then transported to the hospital for alcohol poisoning.  THIS IS A HIGH SCHOOL DANCE MIND YOU!  Then the black bitch tried to get attitude.  Homey don't play that.  Nick ran and hid under the coats cause he thought I was going to hit her.  She's lucky I didn't hear what she muttered as she walked away otherwise I would have.  The topper of the night was when everything was well and done, and I head back to Beth's house to finally pass out.  Oh wait, I HAVE NO KEYS!!  Yeah I had to turn around and go back, I walked into a dolly and busted my knee open, but then was pleasantly surprised by Nick's good attitude on my way out.  Be still my heart.  Of all things, that was the one thing it couldn't take.    Oh yeah, and I ate my sandwich behind cactus in the coat room.  When my hands got a little messy, I used the coats as napkins.  :)   "Umm can you find my purse?  It's Gucci."    GUCCI THIS YA TWO BIT WHORE!!

      i forgot to put this in, but let me just say that i love brendan mc-chef (i dunno his last name).  "I'm whipped, and I admit it.  Look at how happy I am.  Men should just admit to themselves that women have all the control in the relationship.  They wear the pants.  If they just admitted it and moved on, they'd all be as happy as I am.  Now I gotta go home, get down on one knee, and propose to my girlfriend.  Anyone got a cigarette?"

      i haven't updated the blog since tuesday, this may have been the longest stretch ever.  maybe because my life is just sucking right now.  we will recap in reverse chronological because my brain is fried like the calamari i was serving all day.    today was hella-ridiculous.  it started with me driving up to bridgewater to fill out some forms and pee in a cup, but CJ wasn't there so i had to haul ass to kat and try and make it on time, which i did.  lunch was....well busy to say the least.  i ran almost 500 dollars which is a change from the 150 i've been doing.  tom bender threw us all an extra 10 dollars cause we kicked ass even though nia served her table a beer wtih a side of glass-chards.  hehe.  what am i gonna do tonite?  take a long ass nap, wake up and go to the gym, and then probably pass out again.  i'm a loser.  yesterday lunch was ok and then i switched to hostess at 4 which was boring.  i guess it's a blessing in diguise that they're closing the dining room because no one came in for dinner except for a bachelorette party.  now i just have to get my ass in shape so i'm not the blubbery beer tub girl.  kevin pinched my ass and i told stacey.  oooooooo he's in troooooooooouble.  wednesday was wednesday.  tuesday was horrible.  i was given notice to move out of my house.  i had a job interview in the morning which i'm still working on.  i gotta pee in a cup!  dave decided he would grace me with his presence.  we got in a fight, surprise surprise, but i won't repeat what he said because i will stroke out again.  we're still fighting.  wednesday will be our six month anniversary.  i haven't seen him in...maybe a month and he hasn't said anything about it....so basically i will never speak to him after that.  if i do you have my permission to beat the shit out of me.  that is all.  goodnight.

      last night me and nia went up to jaime's house to sing kareoke with her.  it was a dicey drive with jaime's directions.  "word....for....word," was all night could say about the small sign we were supposed to be looking for and the "over the overpass" comment.  so we ride down to the bar, and three beers and a few shots later me and nia are singing the dixie chicks, "goodbye earl," and we got the bar on their feet!!  things i learned: i was not meant to sing sweet caroline, jaime is really good at kareoke, and i need to start praticing my janis joplin for next week.  yesterday i did nothing.  my parents started making me pay for more stuff.  i think their plan is to have me become poverty stricken in the hopes that that will motivate me to get a job.  hi, do you not see me sending out resumes?  of course where i send them to illicit comments from the peanut gallery.  why are you applying to somewhere in eatontown? BECAUSE THEY'RE HIRING MOTHER FUCKER!! NOW GET OUT OF MY FACE!  sorry, i'm a little frustrated.  sexually frustrated.  i need to have sex like woah.  on that note: if you're a boy and you're hot you should get at me, because i'm horny like a goat.  i'm so romantic.

      this is probably the funniest thing i've read in a long time:  "there is nothing wrong with masturbation. it does get tiresome, but i consider it my days workout. funny how i workout three times a day and lose no weight. i think back to the days when i actually was running three miles a day and wonder if that was a dream. i want to go back to vegas. this email is random."  that my friends, is taken from an e-mail that sarey wrote me.  hehehe.

      upon a reader's request, here is a blog update:  thursday night me, nia, and mariss went to see school of rock.  i was kinda hungry because i hadn't eaten dinner, so me and nia went to pathmark.  she wouldn't let me buy a chicken to bring in.  she said i was ghetto.  i'm from north brunswick. there's no way i can be ghetto.  instead i settled for potato chips.  then of course we bought some liquor and headed to the movies.  it was a little tough to fit everythign this time because of nia's porkrhinds, but we managed.  for some reason, i couldn't finish all my drinks!!  probably because i ate the entire bag of potato chips.  let's not talk about it...  yesterday i worked at double at kat.  lunch was slow as hell, and then i switched to hostessing.  good thing i brought normal clothes cause i looked like a retard in my 50s gear.  it was all about the drama yesterday.  stacey quit :( and nia came close to blacking out.  when her eye started twitching i stopped talking.  anthony made jamie cry which was humorous to me, but then he got in trouble and had to go home early.  mmm what else.  i forget, but i'm going to miss seeing my buttlover in skank clothes every friday and saturday night.    you'll all be shocked to learn that NB hasn't called me since thursday morning at 9:11am.  maybe shocked isn't the word, the phrase "told you so," comes to mind.  however since said negro hasn't called, i haven't called him either.  or sent any text messages.  i'm slowly beginning to get over his tired ass and it feels good.  so does thompson's ass...i think i'll have to grab it more.    why am i awake at 9:13 on a saturday morning?  BEATS THE FUCK OUTTA ME!!  My feet still kinda hurt from last night, and I think I have to poop.  On that note, SMELL YA LATER!

      i think i'm a compulsive blog updater.  i think in fantasy land i want some talent scout or publishing guy to read my blog and think it's the funniest shit he/she's ever read, and sign me up to write a book or something.  i wonder what the title would be....send suggestions to butthumper@cunnilingus.com.  kat was actually pretty busy today, well not really i think i had 9 tables during the "lunch rush."  nia's people actually over tipped which almost sent me to the grave early, but i reluctantly decided to stick around.  upon talking to marissa i realize that i need to find my ass a full-time job asap so that i can move outta my house.  i've got two months to do it.  i still haven't heard anything from the six places i sent my resumes out to which isn't good, but i guess i gotta keep on trying.  i think it might be naptime....  yes, yes it is.

      here are some dinner musings for your entertainment:  so my mom is on this new diet...therefore we've all been suffering.  so she makes a friggin' salad for dinner.  homey don't eat salad.  so i'm like listen mom, no offense to your salad but i'm gonna need to eat something else with it, otherwise i'll be back here in an hour looking for something else to eat.  so i find this stuffed chicken breast in the freezer and it's stuffed with this garlic sauce.  so i cook it, and cut it, and the sauce explodes onto my plate.  so my dad goes:  dad: you should throw that away. mom: yeah, it's all butter (hence it's the best part, why would i eat plain chicken)  so i don't throw anything out, and begin to eat.  i must've been engrossed in my delicious fatty meal because i don't notice the eyes staring me down.  dad: SO NOT ONLY DID YOU NOT THROW OUT THE SAUCE, BUT NOW YOU'RE SOPPING IT UP WITH THE CHICKEN??? me: (picks up plate, licks it) MMMMMMMMMMMM BUTTTEEEEERRR!!    then the hateful stares increase.  so i retort "listen dad, i looked at the package, there's 590 calories in this.  i burned 800 atleast at the gym on the crosstrainer.  suck it."  hateful stares turned into wonderment.  i've turned into the person i hate: my calorie-counting father.    god have mercy on my soul.

      today was my first day back at KatManDon't in like 5 days.  It was uneventful.  I made 20 dollars.  WOOHOO!!  Hope I don't spend it all in one place.  not much else is going on.  the crosstrainer kicked my ass at the gym today and i got off early.   speaking of getting off, sarah is trying to convince me to join her and big den in a threesome.  though right now my answer is a firm no, a few drinks and a free meal could change all that.  we'll see how this story ends...  NB has called me about 6 times since monday.  i don't know whether to count my blessings, or brace myself for the next time he hurts me.  i'm going for the second of the two.  katmanboo and his next paintball game are on the same day and i told him i'd go play paintball before i knew when katmanboo is.  so i'm thinking i'll be going to katmanboo.  it can't go any worse than last year.  yesterday i cracked myself up thinking about the first time me stace and beth went to savoys and i met mullet man aka keith.  me: soooo, 35 and single.  why's that? keith: well my mom says that... me: that's ok, my mom thinks i'm a lesbian!!! uhhh....let's make out... (i know, nice deflect)  time to go, joe.  my legs are achin' and my stomach's rumblin'.  word to big bird it's time for dinner!

      so today was a boring day.  another day in a string of days i had off from work.  oh that's right cause i have no job.  well i work three days a week, i don't think that really classifies as a job persay.  so what'd i do today?  hrmm well i woke up at 11am and overheard my mom calling me a slug to my brother.  so i left the house immediately and ventured into stacey's part of town.  i picked up new hamster food and resume paper and wandered around target for a good hour without buyign anything.  i looked at the belly button rings, but mine's still pussing and acting a fool so it won't be changed any time soon.  on the negro front, he called today.  i heard excuse after excuse after excuse and then hung up on him.  according to him he's seen the wifey three times this weekend and she hasn't said anything to him.  riiiiiiiiight.  i put all of his stuff in a bag and shoved it in my closet, if he doesn't come get it or arrange to have it picked up, i'm burning it.  nia: we could hang an effigy of him and burn it.  we just need a cabbage patch doll and... me: all we need is a stick! nia: yeah and we'll put sunglasses on it!  nia also had an interesting idea for halloween.   nia: i could be a bird again... me: A WHAT!??! nia: oh, NOTHING! I MEAN NOTHING!  that's all peeps.  time to take my fat ass to bed.

      Oh yeah guys, I got my belly button pierced yesterday!!  After the initial nervousness, I did really good.  I didn't even crush Nia's fingers as they were inserting a very large needle into my body.  We got lost on the way there because of the detour and we saw some pretty big ass houses.  I kept on saying "we could live there...we could live there." But Nia was much more realistic.  Me: We could live in a church. Nia:  How can we have a sex room in a church? Me: They already have one, it's called the rectory.  And here's stacey's quote of the day on the bizzarre happenings with Dave:  GioSav31 (6:30:17 PM): daves logic: hmmm maybe if i act like i dont know whats going on and i might not get my as kicked GioSav31 (6:30:28 PM): reality: you a dead motherfucker

      I don't even know what to title this entry because I'm so livid (aka hungover) I can barely type.  Let's start with Nia's accident.  Nia got a brand spankin' new car on Monday.  We got into an accident yesterday.  We were happily driving to the mall, and as we're leaving the Kat parking lot, a crazy Indian man with really bad hair decides he's going to run the stop sign in the parking deck and slam into her car.  Nia blacked out and made him cry, I called Kat and soon every employee in there was running to the scene, and Stace called the police.  Then I called my mom, and she yelled at me for letting Nia yell at him.  Her exact quote was, "Two big broads and a black girl? The guy must've been shitting his pants."  So after filling out reports and the guy getting a ticket for having an unregistered vehicle, we angrily drove to the mall.  Hi, now we're at Beth's.  Sitting there merrily, watching friends, carressing each other.  My phone rings.   Me:  Hello? Jenna: Hi is this jen? Me: yeah J: Jen Noronha? Me: Yeah J: Hi this is Jenna Barnes, Dave's wife.  I'd like to know what's going on between you two. Me: Uhhh...what? Dave's wife? I think you need to talk to him.  AND SO IT WENT!  Note to self: Never be too excited about getting your boyfriends address, and be less excited about surprising him with a card...that she opened and read.  BARGH!  So I decide to take my rage into the shower.  Thinking to myself, ok I'll just cleanse myself peacfully and get ready to get drunk.  Suddenly there's commotion.  I peak my head out and Nia's in the bathroom, followed by Sarah wearing just underwear on her lower half.  There is a camera.  Followed by a flash.  THERE ARE PICTURES BEING TAKEN OF ME IN THE SHOWER!!  If i didn't have some damn soap in my eyes I couldn't fought back, but I couldn't see!  I was blinded!  In Sarah's fit of craziness she decides to take vag shots of herself, and nakey pictures of me.  I think she said she's gonna frame them and sleep next to them every night until we can be together....Aaaah.  After that incident, I had three shots and it was on to Kat.  THEY DON'T CALL EM MIND ERASERS FOR NOTHING HONEY!  Three raspberry and sprites later, I'm dancing with Polish and we're hooking up.  BADA BING!  A good end to a very craptastic day.  Lesson #1: When everyone thinks your boyfriend is a dickwad except for you, chances are he's really a dickwad. Lesson #2: Saying goodbye to college also means saying goodbye to your tolerance for hard liquor. Lesson #3: If you don't want to be groped, don't hang out with me when I'm drinking.  Male or female. Lesson #4: Never ever believe a guy when he tells you his marriage is on the rocks.  If he says he's divorce, ask to see the papers.  If you've been going out for six months and you don't know the phone number to his house, chances are that's cause HE HAS A WIFE AT HOME! Lesson #5: When brushing your teeth, always remember to wipe your mouth afterwards.  Nia learned this lesson the hard way this morning. Lesson #6: Stacey is one hot bitch.  That's all folks!

      since none of my lazy friends will update their blogs, i guess it's up to me to be the responsible one.  not much is going on though.  i'm the only poor soul stuck working the day after thanksgiving.  so much for a long weekend.  then again, what's a weekend? because i haven't had one of those in a long time.  i think god is trying to get me to feel rundown, but i'm smarter than him!!  me? rundown?? NEVER!!  wednesday night was interesting.  i've never seen so many people packed into that club, but they were all cheap and i despise cheap people, especially when i'm working for tips!!  that's besides the fact that there were three of us back there instead of two, and i got a lecture at the end of the night since i was the only one who would speak up, i ended up taking the fall for everyone.  granted the situation could've been avoided, but i guess some things aren't as important to people as a paycheck.  then i ate my dinner, at 3am mind you, and headed home.  thanksgiving was good.  what i was awake for anyways.  i passed out before dinner, and after dessert curled up with my knees to my chin on the corner of one of my aunt's couches in the middle of 30 people all laughing their heads off.  granted it was funny while i was awake, but when i was sleeping it was more of a nuisance.  when i woke up mostly everyone was gone.  must've been a good nap.    no good thanksgiving stories.  stacey shoulda been biting on my legs instead of turkey legs.  but that's another story...

      woooooooohoooooooooooooo it's stacey's birthday!!! or as i've been saying all week, "HUMPY BIRFDAY PORKBREATH!!!"  OOOHHHHHHH YYYYEAAAAAAHHHHH.  she's an old fart.  granted she's only 5 months ahead of me, but that's 5 months well worth it.  i've taken it upon myself to reflect about the wonder that is stacey.  is she a kind person?  well, yes, once you get past the iron exterior.  is she a forgiving person? definitely not.  is she hot?  UMM LIKE HELL!!!  and she's a great lay too.  i would know...wink wink.  over the past almost four years (cripes!!) we've had some good times, and some not so good times.  there was the time we rode around in a shopping cart, and then there was my 21st birthday.  there was the time stacey tripped in decker and i said, "porkbeast trip over carpet, stupid retarded," and there was the turkish man (though funny now, not so funny when he was ramming his manhood into our asses.)  there was nia igniting her mr. bubbles towel and there was the incessant firedrills in decker.  don't forget yelling, "you're fucking disgusting!!" every time i burped (in harmony mind you).  let's not forget senior year.  oh wait, i forget senior year.  DAMN YOU KORSAKOFFS!!!    anyway stace, humpy fucking birthday.  may the next year be filled with more men than you can count, and more jollyranchers than you can handle.  maybe a little less gas too.  i love you.  you complete me.    p.s. i had to dedicate a little something nia just cause i was hysterically laughing as i was perusing through stacey's blog entries.   moment #1: happened in september when we went to savoys.  me and stace go into the bathroom and proceed to get into ANOTHER altercation with debbie.  nia busts in and goes "hey guys nice to tell me we were going to hte bathroom...OH HELL NO!!!"  nia is then carried about by a bouncer. moment #2: it just happened during our adventure to AC, but it still knocks me off my rocker everytime i think about it.  homegirls are wasted and we need transportation home.  nia storms up to the first taxi we see and goes, "YO!! YOU OPEN?!??" and climbs in before he has the chance to answer.   awww man i love you girls.

      though i'm still piecing things together from friday night, i'm ready to blog about it.  my brain functions have fully returned, and this can be confirmed by the fact that i can spell functions.  saturday i could not.  the night started off great.  of course we headed down the parkway blasting queen.  nothing says roadtrip 2003 like a little bohemian rhapsody.  oh yeah, and chips.  chips were everywhere.  so we check in, after the ghetto black men make me back out, back in, parellel park, and back out again.  1714 was hot, even though we had to do our own dishes.  the walk-in closet doubled as the poot room.  at first i thought the night was going to be a disaster because we were all tired, and then we couldn't even drink the bootleg margaritas, but i made everyone get their shit together and a few minutes later we were headed towards showboat.  so we're walking, and walking quickly because we were walking through ghetto AC, when some fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine black men start holla-ing at us.  they screamed something about a white girl and nia goes, "they're probably talking about me!!"  so we picked up the pace a little bit.  i commented that shoving a gas pump in my pants would feel good, and everyone tried to disown me. then this van comes careening towards us like a fucking bat out of hell, and it's the flagship van.  he starts yelling at us because it's dangerous and stacey keeps muttering "keep walking, keeeeep walking." but after he informed us that we were about to be shot, we hopped in.  showboat didn't have a keno lounge.  fuck showboat.  so we headed to taj where we sat down and the fine black man next to me started hitting on me, with his woman sitting right next to him!! if they were looking for some kind of threesome, well they would've found it, but they never asked :)  so i won 10 dollars off my first game, but i was sitting next to a bitter nia because she kept on losing, and because we were all sober.  i no longer like cocktail waitresses.  me and nia headed over to the nickel slots while jaime taught stace how to play poker and i won like 20 bucks.  oh man all those nickels felt good running through my hands.  erotic? yes.  we finally flagged down a waitress BUT SHE NEVER CAME BACK.  so we're bitter, we're broke, and we're sober.  not a good combination.  we decided to head somewhere else.  we head towards casbah.  i mention the fact that they're liquor in there and nia beelines it, asks if there's a cover, and then we all experience the most erotic moments of our lifetimes when the security wands are slowly waved over even our most private parts.  daddy liiiike.    at first i was like what the fuuuuck this place sucks, but then mr. bartender, my husband to be, made us drinks.  hi, a little coke with my rum?? NO THANKS!! his drinks surpassed mine, needless to say within two, we were all like "heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey boyyyyyys!!"  the algerian man found nia quickly.  we beat him off with a stick the first few times, but he kept coming back for more.  algerian man: i'm algerian, do you know anyone who's algerian? nia: NO, BUT I KNOW A TURKISH MAN!!! algerian: you're scared of me because i'm a big white guy! nia: ummm ok?  good thing that crazy algerian was persistent because his friend joe was fond of me, and my tongue was fond of him!!  mmm joey likey.  i kept on buying drinks even though stacey and jaime didn't want any, but hey, what's a birthday without a little stomach pumping???    so we danced and i kept feeding everyone drinks and we danced.  the best was when me and stace returned from the bathroom and found nia sammiched in between some RBG and jaime looking very very distressed.  we contemplated rescuing her, pointed and laughed at her, and then conscience kicked in and we pulled her out.  now here comes the tough part: how were we gonna get home?  we couldn't walk through the ghetto again, we'd be shot.  the shuttle stopped a midnight.  stacey wasn't winning that 5 mil.  so i suggested a taxi.  nia banged on the window like the goddamn police and we all hopped in before he had the chance to ask where we were headed.  nia did a nice rendition of a song i can't recall, my memory fades to fuzzy at this point.  i do know i puked like a champ once or twice, we ordered lots of food, and i fell asleep in my mozzerella sticks.  nia woke up with a hunk of her sausage sammich in her mouth.  classic.  here's a little mystery: i took 6 pictures that night.  anyone know what they were of???  ME EITHER!!  i know i took a picture of stace and jaime, and my sugar daddy started waving...mmmm respirators make me horny.    one thing we all learned from that night, we're fucking old.  it takes like a full three days to recover from such shenanigans nowadays which is quite sad.  i've started to rest up now for marissa's birthday week, lord knows we'll all need it.  me: i dunno how i'm gonna make it through marissa's birthday.  i'm old. stace: me and nia will help you out. me: THAT'S LIKE THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND!!  anyways, that's all i can recount of our awesome adventure.  for more details check out stace's blog cause she can definitely remember more than me :)  marissa, you were sorely missed.  20 more days!!!

      is it possible for me to work more? because i'm pretty sure i just picked up another 15 hours every two weeks in my office.  hrmm....  well, it's not like they didn't offer me alternate days off then the ones i have now, but overtime sounded all the more sweeter to my ears.  i'm a overtime hog, what can i say.  if you're gonna do something, do it for time and a half.  ahhh, and now i reap the benefits of being an hourly employee.    does anyone need a part-time job? wednesdays-sundays??  about 30 hours a week?? because until they find someone to fill that position, i'll be giving up my every other friday and saturday off until that person is hired and trained.  oy.  but you know what, it's worth it.  you know why?  because when i think of the extra money, i think of my own apartment/townhouse/condo/rented home.  with a dark pink bedroom and all white linens.  then i think of the sex room aka stacey's room.  with a swing and leather cuffs hanging from the walls.  i can almost hear the whip snapping...wow, i just blinked and returned to reality.  but wait, what's that i hear??  it's the beeping of the microwave...our hot pockets are done!!!  is that the flushing of the toilet i hear?? followed by the required spray of air freshener.  i can feel the burp rising in my throat, and i can hear stacey scream, "YOU'RE FUCKING DISGUSTING."  Then nia comes home.  She flings off her shoes, and the pillow fight comenses.  Oh wait, I must've tapped into Kevin's fantasy for a second there.    Oh well, back to work.

      time to update the blog, unfortunately my life is boring and there's nothing to say.  last night i slept for 12 hours.  i woke up a couple times trying to watch meteors, but it was really cloudy so i was hard.  plus i fell asleep on top of my dad's bmw, but we'll just keep that to ourselves.  stacey, jaime, thompson and others are trying their best to get me to tell them where we're taking stace and jaime this weekend, but i cannot be cracked!! i am the rock you can't squeeze blood from!! but to overcome the internal steampot that was getting ready to explode, i showed my dad what i got him for christmas.  hehe.    i mapped out our route up or down to wherever we're going this weekend, so there's no chance of getting lost.  you know my issue with that.  so i'm quite excited.  now i'm farting around my office, literally and figuratively waiting for my salad to get here.  mmmm tunaaaa.

      So we did go see Elf on Saturday night and it was hilarious as shit.  The troll farted, Will danced, and well, it was a damn good time.  Especially when Nia laughed at the preview for the new Eddie Murphy movie and no one else did AT ALL.    Sunday was the beginning of my carb-free quest until Thanksgiving.  I worked brunch which really wasn't that busy.  I lost one of my checks somewhere so I had to have that amount comped off one of my other checks.  I dunno where it went.  After that I went to the mall, and well, I shouldn't be allowed to have a Debit card.  It wasn't my fault really, but Lerner changed around their whole store and I couldn't help myself!!  I got 50% off Acessories and 20% off all my clothes AND they gave me a 30% off coupon for next time.  DAMMIT!!  Then I bought two sweaters at Old Navy and two new pairs of shoes, one of which i couldn't get on my foot this morning, so I'm gonna have to break those badboys in.  Mmmmm.  Then we ate Seafood until the button on my pants popped off and I went home and passed out :)    That's it for now, Kung Pow.

YOU CALLED ME REMEMBER!??! dad: oh right.  well i guess i'll see you later. me: LOSE MY NUMBER!

      here's a very sleep, very cranky blog update for you.  i have no other choice, i need stimulation to keep me awake.  and i'm at work, so being conscious is kinda important.  my boss already told me she was going to throw ice water on me, i don't think that's a good thing.  yesterday was hella long.  i worked in bridgewater from 9-6 and then hauled ass to kat, ate dinner with nia, and worked cactus/coatroom from 8-close.  we had bought matching shirts and we were gonna cut them up because they were long sleeved, but we each thought our own shirts looked retarded but that each others were cool.  so i changed and nia borrowed my lucky shirt.  they don't call it lucky for nuffin'.  we made bank off coat room, it was excellent.  our base tip per each coat was atleast 2 dollars, and it went as high as 10.  we didn't even sell that much beer, but it didn't matter cause we were ridin high off our coat high.  nia didn't even have to pole dance!!  we were excited and our tastees tasted specially better after at that.  then i hauled ass home, caught 4 hours of sleep, and that brings us back to bridgewater.  i'm goin home and passin the fuck out.  and then hopefully me, lumploaf, and bighead are goin to see elf cause i fucking love will ferrell.  he complete me.

      i'm finally back in my office so what's the first thing i do?  update my blog.  there's not much to say since i did post yesterday, but i've started a new section which will hopefully lead me to update more frequently.  it's called, "nickname of the day."  over the course of my day, i get called my funny, wierd, and innapropriate things.  yesterday's was "hambreath" lovingly given to me by stacey lynn kohler.  make it good, otherwise it might not make the cut.  i also should let you know that last night nia informed the entire line at auntie annes of my raging bowels.  here's how it went:  nia: i don't like raisins, they remind me too much of prunes. me: i should eat raisins more often, they regulate things. nia: LIKE YOU NEED ANYMORE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR BUTT!!  that was followed by hateful glares by me.  but i definitely got her back on the way home.  it brought tears to her eyes :)

      so the last two days were spent in training.  the first day and a half was customer service, and the last two hours were spent reading maps.  now ordinarily, i would enjoy myself.  i like reading maps, it's fun.  but on the first day, we were split into four teams, and i happened to be put with the two dumbest motherfuckers i've ever encountered in my life.  they two idiots made me wonder why they weren't wearing helmets.  people like that really shouldn't procreate.  so here are a few examples of their stupidity:  paul works for member services in the call center.  upon first meeting paul a few weeks ago, i thought he was a pretty cool guy.  WRONG.  paul is one of those sorry mother fuckers that still got wedgies in high school.  not only did he come in carrying a briefcase, but when i accidently knocked into his briefcase, he got all defensive and moved it.  now paul has trouble following directions.  when sam told us to write our answers down, paul shouted them outloud.  when sam asked a question, paul rambled on for hours about something not even related to said question.  when sam asked us this trivia question, "a game was invented in scotland and was first called gentlemen only, ladies forbidden." paul's answer was, "men's room."  paul also came into today wearing a bill cosby sweater.  paul is my age.  i will not forgive paul for that sweater.  chandra was the third link to our ever so successful group.  chandra was a little bit older than us, and well, my people.  nuff said.  when asked to label the states, chandra pointed to maine and said "isn't philadelphia somewhere around here?" and i said "no, philadelphia isn't a state."  that was followed by, "i can't find new jersey."  now, after every direction was given, chandra would ask the same question back.  when sam told us he needed a number, chandra asked if we were supposed to give a percentage.  when asked to find the turnpike, chandra was out in san francisco looking at route 80.  that poor old bird couldn't even find  the continental divide.  now, you all know me.  you know i don't have patience.  well here's a lesson:  i especially don't have patience for dumbasses.  i really wonder how those two don't fall down more.  it's obvious that AAA will hire any dumb ass that walks through the door.  i'm glad i work in a branch office.

      my blog entries are starting to become few and far between.  is it because i'm busier or because i'm lazier?  you decide.  last time i left off, me and stacey were discussing my loose lip-ped problem.  i'm slowly rehabilitating and will no longer discuss my friend's lives with others unless given previous approval.  good enough for you guys??  saturday night's adventure can be found in stacey or marrisa's blog.  either way it was a good time and i was proud of nia's temper control because if i had been my drink, i would've thrown it in her face.  sunday i worked a double at kat.  brunch was somewhat busy, and the seafood buffet was off the heezy fo' sheezy.  my table of 35 didn't come through so there were only 16.  i still made 72 dollars off the table, so i guess i can't complain.  manny gave me a massage when it was all over and i asked him to marry me.  he said yes.  i'll inform you when we set the date.  other than that not much else is going on.  well, i guess there is, but i don't feel like blogging about it right now.  bed time.

       Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.   Marissa, it seems fitting that you mentioned, "Ya don't play with food," because once again my mom took it upon herself to mention my brother as I was heating up leftover chicken fingers from last night.  Granted she really doesn't get any other chances to talk about it, considering I'm either working or sleeping.  And if I am awake and in my house, I'm usually thinking of somewhere I can go to get out, or watching DVDs in my room.  I must admit though, it didn't go as badly as the last time, probably because yesterday I decided that I'm past this, and I can't be suicidal forever.  That's right folks, suicidal.  I remembered the last time I shut down and how horrible I felt, and I decided that I'm not gonna do this again.  So the next time I see my brother, the encounter will include tears, snots, hugging, more snots, and a lot more tears.  According to my mother, he needs me, and I'm not one to be wrapped up, "in my own little world."    I'm glad my blog entries have been consistently blog-worthy.  Others have slouched, but I can say that each and every entry in my blog, is quality.  It includes everyone and leaves no one out.  Other than my family problems, nothing much has been going on.  Dave decided to deliver an early Christmas present, a stroke, and call me yesterday morning.  I hung up the first time, listened to him insult me the second time, told him to go fuck himself, and hung up again.  Yes that's right folks, I'm actually over him.  Though I best bite my tongue, because all good things come to an end.  Yesterday I worked Nia's first two Kat shifts for her, and then together we closed out cactus together.  It included pole dancing, smacking each others asses, offering to show breasts for 5 dollars, and me telling off a couple of hotties for standing in front of our bar for an hour.  It also included me diving into the Miller Lite/Coors Lite tub every 45 minutes, cutting off a piece of our Tastees sub, and asking people if they were thirsty with lettuce hanging out of my teeth and mayo on my face.  Next Friday night we're in there together again, so bring everyone you know and buy beer from us.  We'll be wearing matching shirts :) :) :)  P.S.  For reasons I can't state because said subject knows how to use a computer, I love Stacey.  "You complete me."  BWAHAHAHA.  I wonder how I make this thing private so said person can't read said blog.  Said said said.    On that note, I have to poop.  Sniff ya!

      here is an update, upon request, for all you loyal fans out there.  i guess a lot has been going on, but i guess i'm still not ready to blog it out, because if i publish, that means that i might have to deal with the fact that these things actually happened, and i still haven't come to grips with that yet.  for those of you who know what i'm talking about, my mom tried to get me to talk with her about everything last night.  i guess my brother said something at dinner (i was still at work) about me not speaking to him, and my mom said that he'll have to approach me because i'm angry with him.  well she attempted to tell me this over my cold tacos, and i slammed my plate down and told her i didn't want to talk about it.  she followed me to my room, and we both proceeded to have emotional breakdowns with "kyle's mom's a bitch" playing in the background.  i won't say that i completely broke down, because i quickly regained my composure while she continued to cry and apologize and explain that she's falling apart.  honey you ain't the only one.    now that i've thoroughly depressed everyone, let's talk about homecoming.  saturday i had to work in bridgewater from 9-3 and then kat at 4.  i got there and the place was dead, so beth cut me at 630 and i joined everyone at marley's for dinner.  well i had already had dinner, so i just had some drinks.  then we got changed in the stud and proceeded to kat.  we got there around 830 and i made everyone take a shot of jager in the parking lot.  then we moved out to main bar and everyone's ass wasn't even firmly planted on their bar stool before i ordered a round of shots.  mmmm amaretto.  a few hours pass, stacey's hammered, nia's throwing quarters into my breasts, and thompson is hitting on me like ike on tina.       sunday is not a good day to be hungover.  i will repeat that to myself till the day i die.  i was in good shape until nia found urine in a coffee carafe and told me to sniff it (this was before i knew what it was).  then i hip-checked a few small children and puked my brains out in my favorite potty stall.  brunch was really busy but somehow me and kara only made 40 bucks.  dinner  was busier and for the day i took home 102.  not bad.  "His breath is more kicking than the US Women's National Team."  BWAHAHHA!!  Oh man, stacey makes me snort.  Here's another funny conversation I had today  Rick:  You were there on Saturday?  Why didn't you say hi to me BITCH!" Me: Excuse me RICHARD, but I was out at Main.  I saw you once and you were being cranky in Kat Alley so I didn't wanna say hi and run the risk of getting smacked. Rick: I'm never cranky. Me:  HA! I think your nose is growing. Rick:  That's not my nose...    Other than that, I dunno what else to blog.  I'm sorry I missed your party Marissa, and i'm sorry if I've been especially moody and cranky, but I can't help it.  I'm misplacing the anger I have towards my family onto others, so be forewarned.  Unless of course you deserve it, and then in  that case fuck you.

      i just burst into tears at my desk.  why?  i really have no idea.  i think it was because i thought of what keith said to me this morning before he left.  i think it's mostly because i want my family to go back to being normal pre-brian's problems.  my parents don't even talk anymore.  it's silent and it drives me nuts.  i make up reasons just so i don't have to be home.  i will hurl myself into a drink binge never seen to the human eye on new years eve.  actually no i won't.  self control.  my resolution for '04.  and just remember yours sarah:  penis no more in '04.

      a man just called and said, "thank you much!!," when he was hanging up and i had a steve mcneill flashback.  oh man, what a great guy.  remember when he told the story about the  bell boy with the weed in his trenchcoat??  good times, pasty legs.  anyway, christmas is officially over so i can go back to being the jolly person that i am.  oh man, i'm surprised i got that out with a straight face.  christmas was alright.  too bad i worked through it.  hi sleep deprivation much?  i've gotten 11 hours in the past two days, but i'll make up for it tonite.  nia's lucky she has such a sweet ass otherwise i wouldn't have covered for her last night.  and it was slow.  very very slow.  not even any eye candy to look at.  and i'm pretty sure that allison and ashley were talking about me across the way.  and of course i'm stuck on gate with keith.  i think he said about three complete sentences the entire night.  though he did help in making fun of some guys plaid pants.  good times.  hrmm so what did i get for christmas.  clothes and a digital camera.  i haven't opened it yet, but it looks pretty cool.  my mom also got me this kickass piece of furniture that holds dvds/cds.  and when she gave it to me, well actually, just pointed where it was cause that shit is heavy, she said "it's gonna look great in your apartment."  i thought maybe they rented me one and we were gonna go look at it, but no such luck.  delusional thinking?  i think so.  other than that, christmas sucked overall.  it emotionally sucked.  i need to move soon before those people drive me to the nut house.  then again, maybe i can be one of stacey's clients and she can give me my meds and drive me around and sponge bathe me.  she doesn't do that, but there goes that delusional thinking again.   279 minutes until i can go home....

      here's an ultra hilarious conversation i just had with sarah:  me: let's have sex.  i'm at my breaking point.  i must give into my female urges. sarah: me and you? me: yes sarah: you've lost it. it's official. me: horniness has taken over.  you can stick your little pencil legs anywhere you want.  i'm going to the mall after work and picking out the nastiest outfit i can find.  and then i'm going to spencers and getting whips and lotion and any other shit i can find.  and then you are going to ride me like a cowgirl. sarah: i need a dildo for my pleasure.  wait a second, this is considered cheating.  dennis would be interested in a threesome. me: hell he can come too.  i'll buy him those mistletoe boxers with it right above his penis. sarah: WE CAN ROLE PLAY!  what will i wear? me: DIBS ON COWGIRL!!  i can buck with the best of them! sarah: what about me? me: ummm hrmm.  well dennis can be the cow! sarah: WHAT ABOUT ME! i seem to be left out of this threesome.  jen?? me: you can be a stable hand!!! sarah: no comment.  so basically you will be riding dennis and i will be cleaning up the mess!!!  (sarah signed off after this comment)

      i think it's time to update the old blog...i've successfully avoiding doing it by publishing random quotes and emails without really stating what's been going on....but now that i've let all my secrets out, i can't do it anymore...stacey is right, i do have loose lips!!!  well marissa's birthday was off the hook.  it definitely tops mine being that no one had to have their stomach pumped, and it outlasted nia's being that people actually went out and drank!! (sorry nia, that's my bad)  the night started at marissa's where me and stace lugged that fucking tub up marissa's steep ass stairs.  then stacey put a pot on to boil, and i jumped around wanting marissa to open the damn tub cause i was excited.  i was so excited i gave out my christmas presents early, but you know me, i can't keep that shit in.  so we drank some cocktails, tried to choke down stacey's crunchy ass rigatoni, played kings, watched bad boys 2 (that motha fucka flipped!!!) and then headed out.  we arrived at kat at exactly 12 and sal carded marissa and we headed straight for the shots sir thompson had waiting for us.  a few shots and drinks later, we're all dancing.  i was accused of insulting the turkish man's country because he professed his love for me, and i wouldn't be his girlfriend.  sorry, i didn't know that by turning you down, i also turned down the entire country of turkey...my bad.  the night ended on a sour note for me, but i've decided not to dwell on it.  working the next morning was fucking rough.  beth was liek "i can smell you" so i took a nice irish bath and bathed myself in my perfume.  i had showered that morning mind you.  guess i didn't scrub hard enough.    the week was slow and boring at work.  i broke my own personal record on thursday by hanging up on four people.    lady: hi i'm looking for a present for my in laws, do you have any ideas? me: no ::click::  chinese man: can you hold on for just a minute? me: sure ::click::  spanish lady: are you open on saturday? me: yes 9-3 lady: so you're open? me: yes lady: and what time? me: NINE TO THREE ::CLICK::  all of those calls were followed by an intense amount of muttering.  whenever they hire the 2nd person, they're gonna be in charge of the phones.  so then wednesday was movie night.  stacey was barfing so it was just me nia and marissa once again.  we headed out to the supermarket to get ingredients cause we were gonna cook!!!  so after nia ran into me with the cart, marissa commented that maybe nia should just sit in the cart, and let her drive.  mwahahahha.  we made a nia spinach and artichoke dip for nia's christmas party, and we also whipped up some tastees subs.  man i wish i had that recipe!!!  marissa talking to mike: well you should get better and see me so we can do something...and you know what i mean by something me and nia: ::choking on our food:: nia: well damn marissa!!! me: really!!! nia: i gotta write that down...  and then last night those two idiots dragged me outta my house to go down to kat for marissa's first college night.  of course, when we're 5 minutes away from the place, we all realize that none of us are drinking.  so i'm like ok we'll go have one drink and leave.  of course who's standing at the door when we get there, thompson.  very very very awkward seeing him.  so i blew past him and of course polish immediately finds us.  i buy us a round of beers and we quietly stand in the back of courtyard and watch all the male scenery.  of course the rbgs find nia, even though it was dark and she wasn't smiling!!  so we leave and head down to the greasetrucks.  of course a conversation errupts about sex, which leads me to possibly the funniest thing i've ever said  me: i should call (i'll leave names out) and be like "heeeeeeeeeeeey, how you doooooin."  and besides, i haven't watched tv in awhile!!  so then we successfully got sandwiches without getting hit on...which relieves me and also angers me at the same time.  i mean, we looked hot!!!  but then again, we were too busy discussing nia's overusage of her blinker.  and let's not forget her driving wheel.  ahhhhh good times.  i miss my sexkitten stacey though.  smooches.

      me: did you read marissa's blog? nia: yes!! me: you know it's a good night when you wake up naked and have no idea why!!  i always used to do that!! nia: it really is!! me too!!  i would always hope that maybe someone had taken advantage of me, but then i thought i probably had just tried to take advantage of myself but passed out because i wasn't that good.

      nia's words of wisdom on the fact that it now takes us three days to recover from a night of shenanigans rather than just a long nap and some gatorade:  i definately think we lived in a state of constant hangover and didn't even realize it for like all of senior year.  we must have been like walking zombies or something.  and we all definately handled out liquor better!  now we go out and grandma 1 is on medication and can't drink at all, grandma 2 is pawning her drinks off on grandma 3, grandma 3 tries to give her drink back to grandma 2 (like she forgot she didn't want it),  and grandma 4 forgets how to get home and has to wake grandma 2 up for directions!  this is just bad...we're supposed to be in the prime of our lives and all of us are in bed by 10 at the latest.  something needs to be done!

      hrmmm, not much to talk about.  last night i was craving mcdonalds chicken nuggets really fucking bad.  but my dad refused to go to sleep because he had just found the hole my brother had punched in the wall, and he screamed at my mom on the phone and hung up on her.  so i was telling nia of my tale when i decided i was gonna go out and get my nuggets, and bring them to her house.  and then i had a better idea....let's watch bad boys 2!!!  stacey's gas was raging so she couldn't come, and marissa had to study for finals, which means SHE WAS COMING.  i mean damn, finals week wouldn't be what it is without last minute cramming, suicidal thoughts, and all nighters.  oh yeah, and lots and lots of stackers.  so i got my nuggets, and i ventured over.  me (perusing through a build-a-bear catalog): hey look it's britney spears!! (refering to the disco bunny) nia:  bunny spears!!! me: OH MY GOD!! marissa: what happened?? (i retold the story) nia: I TRIED TO STOP MYSELF!! BUT I COULDN'T!! marissa: oh nia....  me: when i get home, i'm gonna pause it right on this part, and stamp one out!!  nia: hehehehe, johnny tapioca! me and marissa: it's johnny tapia... nia: oh i thought it was tapioca!! that's why it was so funny!! me: THAT'S A DESSERT!!  all in all, it was a damn good movie night.  and for maybe, the 5th time in the 10 years that i've know nia, i saw her dad.  OH MY!  p.s. marissa your blog was quite entertaining but you ONCE AGAIN forgot to write about the stampede!!!

      i'm taking this from one of the emails i got today, cause well, i'm having ANOTHER rough go at it:  "There is something to be said about finding your own path. It helps to fall on your face a couple of times and pick yourself up instead of waiting for someone else to do it for you. Luv we all have issues that is what makes us human and not machines. Moving in with your brother may give Brian a role model, someone who had to make the decisions on his own, struggle a bit, earn his way. That is what I was talking about a couple of weeks ago, you know what the value of hard work is, you understand that working hard is the only way to make something out of yourself and to fullfill your ambitions, and you have ambition. That is why you are not home scratching yourself and watching TV..."

      hrmmm maybe i should update.  i have nothing to talk about.  friday i was scheduled off from both jobs and nia, stacey, and i were going to venture into princeton for happy hour, but unfortunately it fucking snowed like a mo fo and we had to cancel.  my mom offered to have everyone over for happy hour, but we would've had carrot sticks and diet soda, instead of crab legs and margaritas.  definitely not the same.  saturday it snowed more.  it snowed until my car was covered.  my office closed thankfully but of course crazy katmandu didn't and me and nia ventured down route 1, the ride of our lives.  "Do they have plows in the ghetto?"  we worked an awfully boring office party together.  "It's not an office party till someone's dancing on the table with a lampshade on their head!"  but i did manage to snag a christmas sweetie, thanks manny!!  after that i hopped behind cactus bar.  actually i should've hopped, it probably would've kept me awake.  i checked 9 coats.  yep that's right, nick was impressed by my 9 dollar drop.  after that me and nia slid across 195 down to beths and slept for a good 4 hours before returning back for brunch.  i had two tables, made 8 dollars, and then we went to the mall and spent like 100.  the pedicure and eyebrows were worth it.  the way to my heart is definitely through my feet.  monday i worked.  didn't get to work until 9:30am.  i was supposed to be there at 9.  we won't discuss what happened because my blood pressure is still trying to return to normal.  which is unreasonably high anyway!    ah well, that's all for now.  get ready for saturday and the week following cause it's gonna be great!!!

      coming straight from nia's mouth about this glorious ::cough bullshit cough:: day we're having:  let's not talk about nap time!  it looks like a blizzard out there.  these are the days when we would all sit around in our pj's in your room and watch dvd's and pass out in your bed.  and we'd all order chinese food.(some of us, who will remain nameless would spill it and clean it up before other's saw) .  and then we'd play with little gorbie and feed the little guy.  may he rest in peace.  and then if we had enough energy, we'd midget toss.  i'd get all bruised up and hurt, u guys would laugh.  sigh...those were the good old days.

      hi hambreaths.  i say that plural because you all eat ham, and therefore have hambreath.  maybe you should have one of my mints.  not only are they tasty but they come with a sweet message, "your breath smells like butt."  thanks thompson!  so i'm busy doing nothing at work.  nothing yesterday, nothing today, nothing tomorrow.  and they're actually hiring another receptionist.  part-time thankfully.  so there's gonna be two of us back here farting around.  i mean that literally.  yesterday i had very very bad gas, and i would poot, and then swivel around in my chair to disperse any smell.  you think i jest...actually no you don't.  you're my friends, you know how disgusting i am.  next please!!  so this week and weekend haven't been all that exciting, hence my lack of blog update.  i worked my butt off last week, and this week ain't any different.  cept i took on one less kat shift, which might help me with my exhausted-ness.  tonite me and nia are going food shopping.  you know it's gotten bad when nia's eating lean cuisines...she never eats lean anything!!  unless it's lean wrapped in bacon and then deep fried.  mmmm that sounds good.  so i'm shopping on the internet for my mom and brothers and a certain NB for christmas.  now i know you're all saying why they hell are you gonna get him something for christmas, but i've had this idea in my noggin' for awhile, and i just wanna get it for him just because.  it's actually pretty sweet :)  besides, maybe when he sees it he'll come and bang the hell outta me.  lord knows it's time!!!  bwahahha.  oh man, now i'm even hornier...good thing the bathroom has a lock on it!!  anyways, this friday will be my first time going out for happy hour where i actually have a job.  it's quite exciting!!  i'm not sure where we're going yet, but i know joe's crab shack will be involved and also a certain big dumb oaf, "on friday nights i sit at home and watch tv." and his elderly friend, "i'm wearing my cute jeans."  bwahahahha.  oh man, it's gonna be good!

       "Cause hell hath no fury like a women who has not been cranky in a week"   That's right Joseph, and today, clients that walk through those doors are gonna either 1. Get my sketcher shoved up their butthole or 2. Turn right around because they see the look on my face.  My boss just walked in and goes, "WHAT KIND OF ASSHOLE COMES OUT ON A DAY LIKE THIS!!!?!??!"  Exactly my thoughts.  Given the previous statement though, why the hell is my office open???  I mean really!!!  I called the AAA hotline like 4 times this morning making sure the message didn't change and tell me the office was closed.  Then I called Nia and Joseph to make sure they were working too, cause otherwise I'd be bored off my rocker.  Good thing they are.  Oh well, time to twiddle my thumbs.

      once again i've successfully put off updating my blog and instead supplied you with random funny, and often not so funny conversations between me and you.  there's only like 4 people who read my blog anyways, so i might as well say me and you.    there's been nothing much going on.  my fellow lovely stacey came down with pneumonia....that has really put a damper in my sex life.  i miss you pookie.  what else.  well i've been working a lot.  no big surprise there.  i also haven't minded spending time at kat, cause well, i discovered despite my best efforts, i fell pretty hard for joseph.  so it's been nice spending time with him.  and since i'm not in egypt's river anymore i've let him take me out/me take him out.  it's been really fun.  eating indian food with sarah and dennis, ice skating, just hanging out.  he's good people.  as sarah said "joe is the bomb diggity."  or now as she affectionately calls him, joeeeeeeeeeey.  other then that not much else is going on.  me nia and marissa had another successful movie night at my house this week.  we made baked macaroni and cheese and crab cakes, little hot doggies, and chicken flautas.  mmmmm.  i'm still trying to lose that weight.    me and sarah went to a 6am spinning class this morning.  when i put my arms up on the bike i was like WHAT THE FUCK WHY ARE MY ARMS SORE, and then i remembered some late night activities i had with joseph and i kinda smiled coyly and went back to pedaling.  sarah cut her leg open.  fun fun.  oh well, back to the grind.

      mother fuckit in a bucket i'm bored.  as much as i pray for days off, i'm beginning to realize why i don't have them that often.  because i get bored.  anyway, what is there to say about new years '03.  not much.  i was stuck in my tiny ass gate booth from 8-1:30am-ish watching my friends throw back drinks like it was their jobs.  granted i'm pissed off i volunteered to work because it looked like i missed a kick ass time, but i'm glad i didn't get myself into trouble like i did last year.  oh yes, i'm the queen of code greys.  this year ended better than last year seeing as how i remember getting home, considering this year i drove, i did NOT throw up in the employee bathroom, nia did NOT have to remove my underwear, and stacey did NOT have to ask rick about his religion.  oh yeah, and beth didn't throw up on him.  it was kinda fun/frustrating being designated driver.  fun in that i got to make fun of nia the next morning, frustrating in that i had to damn near put her in a leash to keep her from crawling outta the window!!  after that i went back to my hotel room and slept.  i woke up when thompson got there, but then i slept some more.  then i woke up for lunch, found out chutney manor was closed EVEN THOUGH I CALLED AND ASKED.  so we went to fridays.  after that i made thompson drive back, and pretty much i slept from 2pm thursday until 830am friday morning.  i woke up once to eat my leftover mozzerella sticks.  and i recited the first 10 minutes of bad boys 2 to thompson but i passed out before my favorite scene, the car chase.  i also slept through some busted ass movie he brought, but that's cause it was corny.  now that i've rambled on, and i know you really don't care, i'm gonna go.  marissa has helped relieve some of my boredom.  woohoo!

      the masses have requested a real update.  not really, but i like to think so.  i think the most amusing thing to recount has been occuring all week.  and that has been the event of my brother turning 21.  i mean, we all know how much i love to celebrate birthdays.  and it gets stacey so excited she pees her pants and sobs uncontrollably.  oh wait no, that's just alcohol poisoning.  but anyway.  the party kicked off monday where he turned 21 at midnight on monday night/tuesday morning.  me and joseph met up with beth david and sarah at thomas sweets in new brunswick to start pregaming for our easton avenue bar crawl.  after they ate some ice cream, we walked down to corner tavern.  we drank a little bit, watched las vegas and average joe, played some shuffleboard, and then headed over to knightclub which is where brian was headed at the stroke of midnight.    brian calls and informs me that his car has been towed.  happy birthday, love the new brunswick police department and the funeral home lot he parked in.  so we're playing darts at knightclub when i see his drunk ass stumble through the door.  he buys a beer, i buy him a beer, he takes a few (like 7) shots including a double shot of 151, and he proceeds to get himself cut off by the bartender.  good times, bad 151.  so then we all stumble down to olde queens.  (i just pooted)  where my brother downs a couple more beers and more shots and then proceeds to pass out talking on his phone to god knows who while propped up on the ledge.  so me and joseph drag him outta there, where he drunkenly babbles about how he doesn't want to go home tonite and asks for money (more money) and then my cell phone because his battery is dead.  so we leave him at jimmy's where he's scarfing down fat samiches.  skip to tuesday morning.  7:10am, brian calls my mom for a ride.  my mom has tennis at 8am so tells him she can pick him up and he can come to tennis with her, and they'll get his car afterwards.  my mom goes out on the courts.  my mom comes back and finds my brother passed out and drooling with his shoes off, his sweater over his face, and his pants down below his ass so that his underwear is hanging out.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY DORKER!!!  hey, being caught with your pants around your ankles is better then being naked and shivering in the emergency room of mercer medical.

       Sarah's Top 10 Pleasure List:   10.  When you have to fart in a meeting and the meeting finally lets out and you get to fart freely!!! 9.  Finally yanking out that hard to tweeze eyebrows. 8.  When you're using a q-tip in your ear and you get a big hunk of wax on it.  (this is when me and nia agreed with her, cause we know the pleasure of using a q-tip.  and then sarah continued) AND THEN YOU EAT IT!! (this is when everyone put on their disgusted face.  "we don't eat it after!!!")  It's cool, it takes bitter. 7.  When you lose a sock from your favorite pair of socks and you finally find the missing mate! 6.  When a guy licks your ear. (I agree!!!) 5.  When he penetrates you with his hard penis for the first time when you're having sex. 4.  When that hard poop finally comes out. 3.  Finally retrieving that hard booger from your nose (We all agreed with this one) 2.  Itching your buttcrack.  "That is pure pleasure!!!" and (drumroll please................) 1.  EATING!!! (me and nia said this would be more pleasureable if you ate in your underwear.  sarah said it's even better naked however we all disagreed.  you would get crumbs in places!!!  "yeah but when you discover a  crumb in your rolls...you're like 'mmmmmmm just one more tasty morsel!!!'")

      joseph admits an embarrassing story he "forgot" to tell me sunday morning:  "When I went to get breakfast, at McDonalds, I guess I was not fully awake and I got all the way down stairs and everyone I walked past was like staring at me, well this one women looked at me and then looked away...so I looked down and bam my Zipper was wide open, all the way down and I mean wide open. I just laughed and zipped up and got the hell out of there without making eye contact with anyone. even on the way in."  p.s. he doesn't wear underwear....

      hey ya'll.  that's right i said ya'll.  i haven't updated my blog for real in a couple weeks.  and in those couple of weeks i went country.  just kidding ;)  well i won't bore you with details from the last couple of weeks.   lemme start with stacey.  homegirl is sick.  i dunno how those doctors fucked up her meds again, but she got herself in the emergency room last sunday.  now on friday she got moved to isolation because the fluid and bacteria from her lungs moved to her stomach.  bah!!!  i miss my lumploaf and even though she said butthumping is prohibitted in the hospital, i think i'm gonna find a way around that. ;)  so now let's start with tuesday.  tuesday started out a good day.  until i got a msg from sarah telling me to check my e-mail.  that's where it all went downhill.  all the servers received a "motivational" email from mike langsner aka the evil jew or ej for short.  so after reading it, i exploded.  then i forwarded it to nia, and she too blacked out.  i think we both put new meaning into that phrase on tuesday.  said blackout was followed by hours of writing our i quit emails.  nia sent hers out a day before me.  she got a nice response.  i sent mine out the next day, i got an evil response from EJ.  long story short, i no longer work there.  he responded to me quitting by firing me.  but, i had already quit.  don't think you got the last word EJ, cause i did!!!  friday my mood greatly improved because me and joseph headed up to new york a day earlier then everyone else.  we wanted to do some sightseeing.  right.  we didn't leave the room until it was time to eat.  saturday we movtivated ourselves to go to toyrus though.  plus we were hungry again.  we had fun in there and the ferris wheel was good even though we got stuck on the stupid pokemon car.  i actually took pictures where joseph looked normal much to my surprise.  then later that day beth and david arrived.  we went down to the lobby to meet them, and joseph's sweater was on inside out, i have no idea why!! :)   hehe.  ok so new york was good.  we had the best  dinner ever.  a place called tello's.  i can still taste that  sauce.  so good.  then we met up with everyone at no idea.  no really, that was the name of the bar.  there was enough vodka in my drink to stun a horse.  that's when i knew the night was gonna be good.  then we all headed out to culture club.  now i thought that going to an 80s club would be funny, and man was i right.  right off the bat sarah fell up the stairs holding her 12 dollar redbull and vodka.  it was the funniest thing i've ever seen.  it  was like a slow motion fall.  the greatest part was when her  chest hit and her drink splashed up into her face.  like joseph said, if he had caught it on tape, he would be a millionaire.  we left around 1ish cause i was tired and so was he.  we went right to sleep when he got back.  no joke.  and then sunday morning i watched my girl while joseph scrounged for food and then we peaced out with michael and nia.  another funny moment was michael standing at the train door waiting for it to automatically open.  which it doesn't.  then joseph, the last in line, got caught in the door as the train was pulling away cause michael waited so long!!!  hahaha, good times.  for me atleast ;)

      the masses have requested an update, and by the masses, i mean sarah and nia.  my life is still in shambles.  let's see where we left off.  oh yeah.  the 22nd was joseph's birthday, so me and him, sarah and dennis, beth and dave headed into princeton for indian food.  we decided to meet at 7:30.  7:32 phone rings, it's my dad asking where i am, who i'm with, what i'm doing.  8:30ish phone rings again, it's my parents, they're at kc prime where they think i am, telling me to come outside.  haha, i'm in princeton assholes.  that was followed by a long, actually productive talk.  things haven't gotten better, things haven't gotten worse.  i spent all last weekend with them.  we opened my new back account, i played tennis twice, we went to the movies, me and my dad went out to dinner.  it was very nice.    thursday i had my post-op appt in princeton.  she said everything feels normal and i can go back to my everyday activities.  she asked what kind of birth control i plan on using, and when i yelped ABSTINENCE she chuckled and agreed that yes, that was the best form.  work has been ok and i booked my first hotels last week.  6 of them in one day.  it was exciting.  then i had my disney training so now i can sell it.  woohoooooo.  ummmm other then that, i dunno what else to talk about.  i have a busy busy summer coming up.  july we've got niagra falls, dave matthews, and my mom's big 5-0 surprise party.  chances are if you're reading this, you're invited.  august is ocean city.  no words can express my excitment for chugging alcohol while floating on an innertube.  mmmmm.    ok this entry sucked, but what can i say.  you forced me to write!!!  hehe.  that's all paul.

      on the weekend alone i've contemplated many things, and in my daydreams i came up with the perfect marriage proposal.  i decided that i want my boyfriend to ask me to marry him with a stuffed animal.  but not any stuffed animal, i want it to be a build-a-bear.  like, he makes the bear, and records his voice saying, "will you marry me?" and he gives it to me.  and i get all pissed off because it's a stupid bear, but then i press his hand, and he asks me to marry him!!!  i'd fucking die.  plus, you get to keep the bear, and him asking you, FOREVER!!!  oh man, when it comes to that point in my life, and mr. man is searching around for the perfect way to do it, you keep that in mind!!!

      so basically my life is in shambles right now.  i lost my family and my boyfriend within the span of like, 36 hours.  yeah yeah, it's gonna get better with my family...maybe eventually.  my mom walks around  crying and my dad keeps himself busy.  i think brian was the most disappointed because he won't talk to me either.  my only saving grace right now are my friends.  so thank you.  i guess i should un-depress my blog and atleast comment on everything else that has been going on.  for st patricks day me joe nia mike sarah and dennis met up at bennigans.  before everyone else had gotten there, i had already chugged a margarita and two miller lites, so i was lit.  then when we sat down, i proceeded to have two more miller lites.  so of course, i had to break the seal.  when i come back, i realize that a key ingredient of my cheeseburger is missing, the bread.  hrmmm, who could have eaten it?? SARAH!!!  the jew jewed herself my cheesey bread!!!  unacceptable.  so then we headed over to houlihans and met up with my brother.  by that point i had overcome the initial embarrassment of wearing my 4 leaf clover headband and displayed it proudly.  i had two more beers and a shot, and the decided i was tired and me and joseph headed back to nia's.  well things got hairy with my parents after that, so instead i went home, got reemed out for another 2 hours, and then went to sleep for 4 before having to get up at 6:15 because we had a work meeting at 8am LEARNING HOW TO USE THE PHONES.  ask me why we had to do that.  cause i still don't know.  then last night we went to the cheesecake factory.  it was really really good.  but there was a lot of fucking food.  food everywhere.  just food.  after the appetizers we were all looking beat, and after our dinners, we all unbuttoned our pants and sighed in gluttony.  none of us had the heart to even attempt a piece of cheesecake.  next time i know, pace myself.  marissa:  i saw ralph at the hospital, he drives an ambulance. nia: so he's like an ambulance driver? me and marissa:  ::silence::  that's all.  this weekend i'm going to make myself pity cds, and then cry my eyes out while listening to said cds and then hopefully by monday, i'll be all cried out and ready to move on with my life.  that's all.

      me: we should start our own business, hire employees, and then do nothing all day. nia: it could be katmandu!  hehe.  but on a more serious note, thanks to everyone for supporting me this weekend!!!  specially nia for bringing me tastees and peanut butter eggs to make me feel better, marissa for imparting her knowledge, beth for her bed, and sarah for hers too.  i even left the dinosaur sheets on there for fun.  and cause i was too lazy and cramped to take them off.  can't lift anything above 10 lbs for a little while, it's gotten me outta lifting boxes and i'm not complaining!!!  but anyway, yeah, definitely the roughest couple of days i've ever had, and it's good to have friends you can count on.  that's all.  tear, sigh.

      you know a year ago yesterday, sarah shit her pants in las vegas.  then i gots to thinking, has sarah changed over the past year??  have i changed over the past year??  not so much.  we still sit around pooting.  sarah still smears something on her face everytime we go out to eat.  she still attempts to throw a leg and hump me at any given chance.  i still pick on her and she gets mad, but then she gets over.  i think over the past year we've all changed, for the better not for the worse.  we stuck by each others sides in college, but now we've all branched off and started new lives with new jobs and new people, but we still have that core to come back to when times are tough or when you just feel like going out on a friday night.  that's all.  on another note, i was at americana diner yesterday with joseph when a large man wedged his way into the booth next to us.  and as he wedged, i looked and saw a large stain on the back of his bright blue sweatpants....a large POOP stain.  now i ask you, if you were with that man, going out to eat in a public place, wouldn't you be like, "hey buddy, you got a little something on your pants."  granted this was no small stain.  it was about the size of a personal pan pizza from pizza hut.  mmm pizza.  that's all.  :)

      last night me, nia, and sarah met up at subway for dinner, and then we were planning on heading to the movies.  me and nia were patiently (or not so patiently) waiting for the jew to arrive.  when she did, she walked in and said hi.  me and nia looked at each other simultaneiously, and i gave her the "ok it's my turn" look and exclaimed "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WEARING!??!"  sarah had on some granny sweater with rainbow dot trim, and then a TAPER in the middle of the back of the sweater!!!  it was ridiculous!!!  it looked like some kind of cape.  except jew's aren't superhereos.  nia said she could've done the batty dance in it, which led both of us to do the dance at our respective desks.  then of course, like all discussions do, it led into a conversation about sex.  all i have to says is, "how is sitting up acrobatic!???!"  then we saw against the ropes with meg ryan.  classic quotes were uttered by miss nia meadows.  such as:  nia: it looks like the puerto rican day parade!!!  and  nia: i bet they all came in the same car!!!   hehe.  good times, bad sweater.

      last night, my boyfriend and anthony cessaretti, got beat up by a midget.  a girl midget.  here's joseph's testimony:  joseph: her fist was so small it was in my eye and when i blinked my lashes hit her wrist...her whole fist was in there....ouch.  twice.  no lie jen she was 4ft 5.  no more then 4ft 7 tops.  92 lbs.   me: I KNOW WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE SAD! joseph: atleast i didn't get kicked in the head like tony.  and i'd like you to know she kicked me as well!!!  and i did not hurt her at all!! me: THOMPSON PLEASE STOP!! I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SNORT AT MY DESK!! joseph:  MY EYE HURTS!  it was liek a little tiny baby fist. oh yeah, she knocked the lens outta my glasses when she punched me the first time and her fist when right through the frame the second time and bam right in the same eye....OUCH.  i think the second one punched me in the head but i didn't feel that.   me: and how'd tony get kicked again? joseph: when i let the girl go....you know, the one that jabbed me like tyson, anyway, her male friend was dragging her away and tony was holding the other girl down, who also attacked me, when she went by him she kicked him in the head.  tony split the other girls chin open and she ended up in the hospital.   me:  i think it's funny that you're trying to sound like a victim.  what's next?  gonna let a girl in a wheelchair beat you up? joseph:  i was the victim!!! joseph: oh yeah and she was wearing camoflauge and a headband like rambo...i'm serious!!! (this was followed by more snorting and a change of subject....it was too much!!!)

      mom: why are you driving like a bat out of hell? you almost hit my butt!! me: well maybe if it wasn't so big, we wouldn't be having this discussion. (then she proceeded to chase me into the house)  then i put my two cold cheeseburgers into the microwave and head upstairs to put on my sweatpants.  i come back down, cheeseburgers are gone.  i start crying and go upstairs.  then i slept for 12 hours.  i know marissa called, but i'm not sure what she said.  i know she asked me if i was watching friends, but it was wednesday.  maybe she was sleeping too.

      so, like frank, clarence, and john, this morning wilbur escaped his cage like it was alcatraz.  well, it was my fault really.  i went down to his cage and opened the main door, but then i realized he wasn't in his bed, that he was up top.  so i opened the top and scooped him out, and together we made my lunch.  well until he started throwing turds like his name was holden.  then i brought him back to the cage, and closed the top.  (hint hint)  so i finish making my lunch, go upstairs and do some stuff, and come back down.  "hey, the cage looks off," i say to myself.  "OH SHIT, THE MAIN DOOR IS OPEN!!!"  i run to the cage, i fling myself down on the ground, and lo and behold, wilbur is nowhere to be found.  so i start panicking, my blood pressure is skyrocketing, and out of the corner of my eye i see his furry little bottom waddling between the couch and the corner table headed for the little crawl space behind the couch.  so like a professional football player, or like me diving for a crumb of food i may have dropped, i dove towards the rat and grabbed him so hard he squealed.  then i brought him upstairs to my mom and we both scolded him.  then he flung 8 more turds at us and i returned him safely to his cage.  :)

      me: oh! and surdo fired kimm!! FINALLY! nia: ding dong, the crackhead's gone!!!  and so it goes.  it's monday.  i hate monday's.  i feel hungover from the weekend.  it was a good weekend though, so the hungover feeling is welcome.  i learned that if you sleep sitting up (aka your head above your heart) you'll wake up hangover free.  except i was too high/drunk on saturday to remember to sleep like that.  let's see.  friday i went to get my oil changed.  now, on the flyer i got, it promised 29 minutes or less.  and there were about 5 signs pulling into dayton that they would change my oil in 29 minutes or less.  yeah, an hour and a half later homeboy was finally done changing my oil and shit.  then they ramble off statistics about your tires and the battery, and i'm like ok you might as well be speaking chinese, just tell me where to pay!!  then i spent the rest of my day cleaning out joe's blue car, harassing tony about his pea-head, eating a horrible meal at chevy's, and then we went to see 50 first dates.  two words: fucking hilarious.  i love adam sandler.  saturday i started my day bright and early, and went to the mall to spend my 75 dollars in city cash and new york and company.  only one problem, i didn't like any of their clothes!  i had free money and i couldn't spend it....whyyyyyyyyyyyy.  then i met beth and sarah and i got a pedicure while they got their nails done and then we went to friendly's with joe and kevin.  mmmm brownie cyclone.  then saturday night, the loyals minus beth headed out to marley's for big/little weekend as alumnae sisters.  marley's changed their menu and it sucked.  then we headed to shamrock's and had a few drinks, and this awesome tequila shot.  awesome? tequila? yeah it was good.  strawberry flavored.  then we all got the itch to smoke the funny shit so we headed back to beth's to pick it up, went to wawa for munchies, and then got high in angela's parking lot.  needless to say, never smoke brown weed.  all of us were sick.  i passed out on the couch, sarah went out to nia's car, and when she finally woke up, came back in and said "yeah i get really bad headache's" which might have blown over had the rest of us not cracked up and yelled YEAH RIGHT!!!  during the ceremony me and sarah both got sick, thankfully it was over quickly and we peaced.  stephanie aka slow sigma had to get her corny ass sigma cd back, nia was not happy about that.  i also almost beat the crap outta sarah cause i was so cranky.  soory crumpet.  a special paragraph has to be dedicated to sarah and what happened at beth's.  me stephanie and beth were calmly sitting on the couch when sarah came flying outta nowhere and flung herself on top of us.  me, being the evil person that i am, pulled her underwear out, and gave her an atomic wedgie.  aka i bent her knee back, and put her underwear over her shoe leaving her a quadrapeligic.  so i finally cave in, and untuck sarah's shoe so she can adjust herself.  well you know sarah, she drops trow and proceeds to flash everyone which is amusing at first.  marissa don't play.  when sarah went to sit on marissa (still nekked) marissa flug her like a sack of potatos from the barka lounger to the wall, which is about 4 feet away.  like the cow jumping over the moon, sarah's naked ass flew to the wall, bounced off, and then collapsed in a big heap on the floor.  that blew the fall in culture club outta the water.  by far one of the funniest moments of all time.  sunday we woke up and watched beaches.  then i went to mcdonalds with joseph, passed out in the car, and continued to be passed out while he washed, vacuumed, and amoralled my car.  not really, we went to a self serve carwash so i definitely hosed him down with the high pressure water.  good times.  then we toured trenton, no really, we did.  looking at all the huge historic houses.  we even passed a park.  joe: there's the park i was talking about.  see the deer? me: the little ones look like goats!!! joe: those are goats, the deer are OVER THERE!! me: oh, shut up!!!  then i went home, ate dinner, and passed out.  that brings us to today, and well, nothing's happened today!!  there's a blog update nia, NOW MARISSA IT'S YOUR TURN!

      well you can add certified safety technician to my ever growing resume cause i passed my test today!!! yes!!  never in my wildest dreams, when sitting down on sunday pondering my training class, did i realize that there is so much fucking stuff to learn about seat belts and car seats and god knows what else.  i blacked out on the first day cause we had like 4 hours of breaks, but after that it was smooth sailing.  it was a good class though and everyone in there was cool.  when given the scenario of a two parent family with 4 kids, and when our instructor asked for the best options for this family, ed yelled out, "well a condom would've been a good place to start!!!"   hehe.  sigh.  it was also fun eating lunch with sarah all week.  well let's use the word interesting.  the first day we ate together, she bounced towards me wearing black high water pants, brown socks, and black shoes.  HORRIBLE.  the second day, grey high waters, the same brown socks, and black shoes, complimented by her brown velour coat.  INSERT PUKE HERE.  sigh, but i'm happy to say i passed all my practicals and my final even though thoughts of sarah's horrid color combinations/fabrics/the damn tapered sweater ran through my head.  i'm also happy to say that john stevens finally got booted off american idol!!! (marissa and nia, insert clapping here)  HORRIBLE!!!  next week is big band week though and i want him to come back :(  last night me and nia went over to marissa's to watch friends.  we also took a tour of route 27 in search of chips and dip. mmm we finally found it.  now it's time to battle the heathens back to marissa's house.  once there we stare at rob in his suit, and then in his wife beater, and then as he leaves.  this is when i body checked nia cause i thought he could see us.  whoops, my bad.  friends was awesome.  and like we said last night, if ross and rachel don't get together in the end, then there's no hope for any of us.  they also warned me that i'm not ready for a new jersey summer.  and i definitely agree.  i haven't bought summer clothes since....1994.  i own two pairs of shorts.  i don't own short sleeves.  note to self: go shopping on sunday.  oh well that's all for now.  time to get ready to see kanye aka securely fasten my bib on tight!!!

      oh man, where do i start with friday.  well, i'll start at the beginning.  circa 8:15am i called nia and left her a mind blowing rendition of happy birthday on her voicemail.    fast forward to 7:00pm and i'm running out the door in a race to get down to commerce and back to lorenzo's by 7:30.  i picked up joseph at wawa and we patiently waited outside lorenzos for sarah and big den.  and when i say patiently, i mean i was tweeking his nipples because i was so hungry.  so the devries finally arrive and we eat and head back to big den's so we can drop all the cars off and so joseph can change his "outfit."   the drive down was....well death defying to say the least.  sarah was tailing the car in front of us so close it actually felt like we were in his backseat.  dennis offered to tap him on the shoulder and ask him to speed up.  we also listened to some...well interesting music.  it was especially tear jerking when sarah, dennis, and joseph all started singing, "all by myself," in unison.  tears of joy? no.  more like, ohhh my goooood make it stoooppppppppp.    so we get to mcfaddens and it's pouring of course.  and the guy at the front door decided to flex some bouncer muscle and ask me for back up ID, but whatever.  so we get inside and beth and dave arrive shortly after, and then marissa and mike aka warnock aka kegCHUUUGGGGA.  at this point i was itching for a shot but joseph refused to buy me one, and marissa was like nia will be MAAAAAAD, so i waited.  and then....DING DING DING there's the birthday girl!!!  looking hizzot as hell.  FINALLY I CAN HAVE A SHOT.  it was soco and lime for everyone!!!  sarah shoved poor nia out of the way and made her way straight for mike's crotch.  you think i jest, but i don't.  then again, i grabbed his butt as soon as he walked in, so i'm sure he was expecting it.  soon, marissa heads downstairs to go to the bathroom and secretly smoke a cigarette i'm sure when i realize, kegchugga is singing along to every song that comes on inside the bar, especially beastie boys.  when he screams shrilly as the bar is dead silent, i resolve to pretend that i don't know him for the rest of the night.  rest of the night?? no more like rest of the century!!!    so the rest of mike/nia's friends get there and the night is progressing smoothly.  but where is kegchugga everyone is asking???  hrmm, it's a mystery.  ::keep in mind this man is missing, because it's a key to the later plot::  by this point i've broken the seal and am peeing every 15-20 minutes.  so i head downstairs to the potty where sarah shows me that if you sit on the bench at the right angle, you can see into the guy's bathroom and watch everyone pee at the urinal!!  so everyone else heads downstairs into the blue room.  it's alot better down there, better music, and hey, there's kegchugga in the middle of a dancing circle thing WITH A GIRL!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!??!?!  i could literally see the shit hit the fan and it was not pretty.  so we all stood there, staring at him, and joseph was like man i'm dumb, but that guy is a MORON.  now how do you come to a bar with a girl, who you're sharing a hotel room with for the night, and dance with OTHER GIRLS!??!?!  i'm still boggled by this.    at this point i'm a shot, three raspberry vodka and sprites, and about 3 beers in.  things are starting to get good!!  joseph proudly humps a wall which leads me to rapid fire evacuation of the premises.  corrie, terrie, and couple other girls have arrived and you know what that means....MORE SHOTS!!!  hehe, two more shots later i'm like so what i'm druuuuuuuuunk.  well not really, but kinda, though i wouldn't admit it.  the birthday girl aka nia's shirt has slowly unraveled.  and don't think she was happy about it.  oh yes, we'll be taking that shit back!!!   back to the warnock situation, marissa is now ticked off, and he comes over to talk to her.  things seemed to have gone alright, marissa is smiling and warnock is getting her a beer, only to immediately return to DANCING WITH GIRLS!!!  i would have chopped his balls off at this point, but marissa remained calm cool and collected....for like 5 more minutes.  needless to say they made an early exit.  hey, it's last call and the lights have come on.  we wanna go to pat's for cheesesteaks.  upstairs, i try and convey this message to nia, but she just stares at me blankly.  so i tell mike that's where we're headed and wish him luck with his drunk ass girlfriend.  me joseph sarah dennis beth and dave all cram into ferdie and head to south street in search of a good cheesesteak and then drop beth and dave off and head home.  me and joseph spend 1/3 of the ride home making out before i pass out and wake up in north brunswick.  hehe, it was a very good night and a special mention has to go to the text msg i receieved from nia at 2:05am which stated, "Im waqded."   Yes folks, translated loosely it says, I'm wasted.  As long as Nia had fun, the night was a success.    hehe, that is all.  i've drained myself of all my creativity and writing capabilities.  i will now recover with a nap.

      hehe, i had a good weekend.  what did i do you ask??? ok i'll tell you.  friday i worked til 5, headed to boston market, and then went to marissa's for some dinner, movies, and ritas.  mmmmm.  we watched real world on demand which was awesome, and then started watching sleeping with the enemy.  then i headed home cause i was sleepy and marissa had to work at 7am.  she did however show me what she's wearing on friday, and let me say it's gonna be hard to look hotter then her.  but i'll try my best.  saturday i had to work til 3 and my drawer was on point.  thank god!!  i guess it's good that i'm starting to get the hang of it considering i applied for that same job opening and i'm really hoping i get it.  then i met sarah at the nail place on aaron and she treated me to a birthday pedicure, and some skittles!!!  the asian lady sliced me open, but i forgave her.  sunday me nia jaime and stephanie headed out to the ms walk down in belmar.  while jaime went to the bathroom we learned that we wouldn't get wristbands for the bbq after.  we swore we wouldn't tell jaime til we were done, but stephanie let the cat out of the bag and jaime started yelling.  we calmed her down quickly and started to walk while pictures of pizza slices danced through our heads.  we stopped on the way back and had lunch, and then headed home while writing down numbers for prospective beach houses.  then i came home and passed out til 530, woke up, ate some tastees, and passed out again.  i'm off today.  i have my first counseling session at 1:30 and needless to say i'm a little nervous.  hopefully it helps.  hopefully....

      where should i start?? well, my poop is green for one.  i think it's because of all the crabs last night.  or the martinis.  i'm not so sure.  all i know is that i passed out with my bib still on and my right hand firmly gripping the mallot that the lovely staff at joe's crab shack "gave" me.  my birthday was just another day.  i woke up dreading it, and went to sleep dreading the next day.  really that's just how i live now.  i dread waking up.  well, not so much waking up because i really don't sleep, but i dread the sun coming up and another day starting.  i'm 23 years old and my parents have a death grip around my life and i can't get out.  i mean, i could get out, but then i'd lose them.  it's a catch-22.  i didn't read that book, so i'm not even sure if i used that right.  me nia marissa and kegchuggggga headed to the movies on tuesday night to see the girl next door.  first, nia came to my house for a piece of cake.  i found boogers.  not real boogers, but that elastic sticky stuff in magazines when they add a page in.  so i brought the boogers with me.  oh how the boogers made me laugh!!  then nia stole them.  then i stole them back.  then marissa made us give them to her.  then she secretly gave them to nia, but i found out and stole them back!!!  the movie was funny too.  actually it was really funny.  "FUCK HER FOR ME DUDE!!!! FUCK HER FOR MEEEEEEEE!!!"  except for that attack parrot.  that was fucking nasty.  then last night me nia marissa jaime and beth met up at joe's for crabs.  ohhhh the crabs!!!  i tore into those crab legs like it was my last meal.  i lost a finger nail in the process, but it was worth it.  i thought i conquered that crab, but i guess he's having the last laugh because i have green poop this morning!!!  oh well that's all i can think of to right.  there you go sarah!!!

      another weekend, another weekend full of nothing to do.  actually i shouldn't say that.  this weekend tops last weekend in that i'm actually going out tonite.  oh wait i did last week too....hrmm.  well this week wasn't anything too exciting.  thursday night i headed to my first thunder game with joe, all the while we were very plutonic, and paranoid that my parents were watching us.  either way, we were well behaved even when we were alone.  yay me.  we walked back over to kat to discover lots of firetrucks and hoses....with firemen attached.  nummy.  all because there was a diesel fuel spill so they were checking stuff out.  no water in the club though, nasty.  i said hi to all my security boys and tony's new truck, the f150 i've always dreamed about, and left before it got toooo crazy.  they had to shut the doors because my boys were playing.    is it bad that i'm not excited for my birthday at all??? i mean, what's going to happen?  i'm gonna come home from work, my mom and dad are going to pretend that they like me for 1/2 a second, and then i'll probably end up crying myself to sleep like usual.  i'm not getting any presents, i know that for a fact because they told me so.  ::sigh::  maybe my brother will pull through.  doubtful, he's never home anymore, i don't think tuesday will be any different.    oh well, that's it.  i think my sense of humor left along with my self-esteem, confidence, and happiness.  sorry.

      hrmm so what did i do all weekend?? not much of anything.  friday was busy as hell at work but i managed to book two more hotel rooms.  quite nice.  then i went home, watched brother bear like 4 times, and passed out.  saturday i was in the cashier booth and once again fucked things up.  it was a fucking zoo in there.  i'm still recovering.  then saturday night, had another fight with my parents, and headed over to marissa's all the while daring my mom to show up and see i wasn't doing anything wrong.  we went to bennigans cause we're lazy and we were hungry and didn't feel like cooking.  nia was drunk before the hostess had time to lead us to the table and by the end of the meal her left eye had shut completely.  she also said "who's" about 46 times before me or marissa paid any attention to her.  it went something like this, "whos whos whos whos whos."  hehe.  sunday i got into another fight with my parents, this time i instigated and basically told them that if they continue down this path with me and they're trying to go, i'm gonna end up ODing on antidepressants.  i still don't think they took the hint.  today was another zoo in the office but i managed to book three hotel rooms for someone i'd been working with for a week, and got an intinerary from another lady that looks promising.  yeeeeeeeehaw.  my plans for the week?  tomorrow i'm off so i've got a busy day of getting my hair cut/dyed, getting glasses, closing my bank account, going to the gym, and other such errands.  thursday is my first series of baseball games with joe, followed by big orange cone at kat with nia and mariss.  saturday me and the jew are going out to celebrate passover and eat lots of bread and yeast and non-kosher pork products.  hee hee, i love you porkchop.  oh well time to real world/road rules.  byebye!

       happy memorial day biatch!!!   i should probably save my blogging for work tomorrow but i don't even know if i'm going to have a desk, so i'll do this now.    it's safe to say my first memorial day in new jersey in like over a decade was pretty awesome. friday i was amped for a bar crawl along easton ave with marissa and nia, but i think we were delusional in our thinking.  we're WAY TOO OLD to be trying to pull that shit.  so we went to quakerbridge, ate at friday's, and then went to see shrek 2.  lemme tell you, friday's changed their menu and jacked up their prices.  they're fucking cheap.  and yes i'm 21 and it doesn't matter how you flick my ID, it's not fake you dumbass waiter.  shrek 2 was disappointing.  there was a couple funny parts, especially donkey and his popping noise, but that's about it for me.  saturday i did nothing.  and when i say nothing, i mean NOTHING.  i threw out a bunch of my college stuff, cleaned my closet, and went to pathmark.  i went for a nice drive in princeton too.  got myself lost and then found my way out.  it was nice not to have anything to do.    sunday i woke up butt ass early and met joe at americana for some mozzerella sticks and chocolate chip pancakes (which are still in my car, i should take those things out).  then we went to the liquor store, mixed a little something up, and headed down to belmar.  nia and mike quickly joined us and we spent the better part of the afternoon laying around, playing soccer and football, and BEING THROWN IN THE COLD ASS OCEAN.  NOT HAPPY!!!  >:o.  michael threw me in twice.  he threw nia in once too.  not happy.  cold!  then marissa met us down there and we all headed to sleezeside for some boardwalk fun.  let's just say, there was a random mix of people there.  from the kids in trenchcoats, to the totstitutes in tiny ass skirts, to mr. man getting into his dance arcade game.    so there was this ride on the boardwalk, tower of fear.  you know the one that shoots you up to the top and then you bounce for awhile, and then it shoots you from the top to the bottom.  so me and marissa look at each other with a gleam in our eyes and we're like WE'RE ALL GOING ON THAT!!! nia looked the least amused, but we got her to go on it. so me and joe are sitting on one side, and nia mike and marissa are on the other.  and it shoots us up and i swear i tasted the pizza i had for dinner.  so then it brings us up to the top and we're sitting there waiting to be shoot back down and i hear nia screaming, "OH HELL NO!! I KNOW THEY'RE NOT GONNA SHOOT MY BLACK ASS BACK DOWN!! THEY ARE GOING TO DROP OUR BLACK ASSES BACK DOWN THERE!!"  i would've laughed but i was too busy screaming like a little girl on the way back down.  nia had to be carried off the ride needless to say.  it reminded me to viper at great adventure.  she didn't talk to us for a couple hours after that one.  so after making fun of people in fuzzy leopard print vests, and 12 year olds smoking, we sleepily headed home.  yawwwn.  i slept until 11:30 today, i was quite proud of myself.  didn't  do much today, went to the diner with mariss and we watched love actually in a food coma.  it was alright.    one month until the gre's.  pray for my dumbass.

       i guess it's my turn   so i guess it's my turn to blog about the weekend's events.  friday night like any other.  i sat around scratching myself and went to bed pretty early.  saturday i rounded up the troops and we headed to menlo because homegirl STILL doesn't own summer clothes and it was gonna be hot as balls for the bbq.  it's 11am and we're all hungry so i pulled into dunkin donuts.  what happened next could've only been pulled straight from, "to wong foo, that's every everything, julie nemar," or maybe bossom buddies.  two grown ass men wearing poofy dresses that barely covered their hairy asses.  the second guy was bad no the top of his head, and pulled his remaining two hairs into pig tails.  one hair in each ponytail holder.  i think the main problem was that these men seemed unphased by the fact that not only were they wearing dorothy from the wizard of oz dresses, but that they were wearing them in public without shame.  the sight of it still didn't stop me from housing a breakfast samich.    the bbq was well, a bbq. people talked shit about us when we got there, and they talked shit about us when we left.  i'm sorry your dumbasses suck and i'm cool, it's not my fault!!  the 6 pack of smirnoff twisters and my cherry vanilla black and mild did however soften the blow.  so we head home quite early and nia's in the backseat semi passed out, but hiccuping like some drunk clown and me and marissa are laughing.  So we drop drunky off with enough time for her to sober up, take a shower, and get ready for philly.  I told nia if she didn't feel like going I wouldn't mind, but alas she woke up in time.  So we head to wawa because we were both dehydrated from the earlier drinking and pull up next to a girl sitting on her "bf's" lap and hooking her bra back up.  I start pointed and we go inside and come back out as these two are getting out of the car, only to have Nia point out that it was in fact two girls.  Oh my.  Philly, well.  Nia can tell you, we realize we were old.  I was very happy in my skirt, and no I didn't do the dance, but after several drunken co-eds spilled shit on me, and i kept getting something stuck on my shoe, I think me and Nia both thought, WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING HERE.  Now on a normal night, our asses would've been wasted up on the bar dancing with the rest of the whores, but our feet stayed firmly planted on the sticky main floor.  So sad.....so sad.  I called Nia bright and early on sunday too and we both got amped to go down to Belmar for a day of fun in the sun.  Fun was certainly had, I got BURNT, there weren't many birds, the water was FUCKING COLD and our feet was numb, and we also saw a woman in a thong who's small child was slapping her on the butt.  Gross.  All in all a very good weekend, but next time remind me not to leave home without my geritol, some aleve, and maybe some stackers cause homegirl can't be up late.

      hrmm so what i have been doing over the past week.  not too much.  last weekend was another two nights spent at home.  sunday was well...interesting to say the least.  we found out that brian has gone back to his old drug habits which was really disappointing, but i have confidence that he'll behave himself.  work was really busy this week and it doesn't help that i move around the office from desk to desk like i'm some kind of nomad.  i'm still waiting for my next raise they've been promising for a few months now, but i don't see it coming anytime soon.  i've weighed my pros and cons about applying for this other job, and i think i'm gonna go for it.  it can't hurt to apply and then i can decide from there.    yo nucka, you got served!!!  sorry, random b2k thought.  so anyways, tuesday night me nia and marissa headed to brunswick square in my search for summer clothes seeing as how i don't own any, but sad to say the mall was LACKING hardcore in summer apparel.  me and marissa got in trouble with nia in old navy, but that's all i'm gonna say about that :)  wednesday was savoys.  first time i've seen joseph since nia's birthday.  it was awkward for the first couple of minutes, but uh...we got over it :)  savoys was fucking busted except for the presence of ope.  mmmm. and pable and paul from high school.  interesting.  they're like 30.  thursday night me sarah nia and my parents went to hungry hut to eat some fine indian cuisine.  dinner was going great, especially when my mom brought up my brother and his girlfriend.  it was especially interested when she said, "wow i wish we could find someone to take brian's mind off andrea.."  this is the part of the conversation when chicken mikhani comes outta my nose.  needless to say my dad picked up quickly on what was going on.  then we hit up ritas and called up marissa to join us for shrek 2.  but sadly, nia got really sick.  really really sick.  i had to call home and ask for a house call.  cept we were headed to the doctor's aka my house.  my dad said it's probably food poisoning and that bubble on the right side of her stomach was a gas bubble.  hehehehe, he said gas.  i feel bad for martha when that bad boy decides to leak out.  yesterday i did the unthinkable...the impossible...i waxed my eyebrows.  just kidding, i registered to take the GREs.  July 1st is D-Day and after that, I get the ball rolling.  well hopefully.  by then i should know whether or now I'm employed in Hamilton or Bridgewater.  rutgers or....i don't even know where i'd go to grad school down there.    hehe, anyway tonite i do nothing but sleep and tomorrow is the BBQ is piscataway at nellie's and then philly.  wooohooo.

       i'm so depressed...   first of all, i don't think i've ever updated my blog so much in such a short period of time.  i think it's mostly due to bloggers new templates and comment section.  i want people to tell me they like me :)  secondly, i'm very very depressed.  on this cold and windy ass day, one year ago, me sarah jaime nia and stacey all threw on our caps and gowns, and graduated from college.  now at the time, i was ready to get the hell outta there.  i think collectively, all of our away messages during the last few weeks of school consisted of, "fuck you fuck you fuck you're cool fuck you i'm out."  and it was true, we were ready to get the hell outta there.    senior week started off smoothly.  oh who the hell am i kidding i think me and stacey were the only two there on time.  i knew it was on when we were banging down the doors to the liquor store at 9am.  we drank up and headed out to the address where i think 99.9% of attendees were wasted, we got our wristbands, and headed back to our rooms to get ready for new york.  that was the first night wasn't it??  and by headed back to our rooms to get ready, i mean take a nap.  oh that's right, you're never too old to take naps.  nia went to get "ice" and came back 2.5 hours later with a satisfied look on her face.  we won't get into that.  new york sucked to say the least.  jekyll and hyde was awful, and the bowling alley was waaaaay overpriced, same with the nightclub.  so we walked around the city until it was time to head home.    the next day we woke up nice and early and headed to great adventure.  sweet sweet great adventure.  for those of you not familiar with my theme park antics, i like to walk briskly...well who am i kidding, i RUN to the nearest roller coaster.  so i grabbed everyone's hand and made them run towards superman, which had just opened.  everyone was cursing me out, saying how scary it was, and as we got closer, i was a little nervous too, but they strapped us in, and we were ready to go.  until......the seats tilted back so you're facing the ground.  this is when i looked to my left, and people were giving me the evil eye, and i looked to the right and saw people giving me the evil eye.  i swear i think i saw a few people mouth "i'm going to kill you"  but, the ride was AWESOME.  and i think we'll all admit to that.  shortly after beth met up with us, and fun was had by all.  later that night was Atlantic city.  beth and sarah headed down to meet up with chris, i headed down with dave, and stacey jaime and nia headed down on what can only be called, "the tone deaf bus."  eventually i met up with beth and sarah, but nia jaime and stacey were too bitter to talk to us.  we had fun harrassing people on the boardwalk.  beth was so drunk she flung off her shoes and staring doing wierd things right in front of a cop, and chris tobin was obsessively grabbing my ass.  but hey, i didn't mind.    we ALL slept in the next day and ended up missing the senior BBQ.  the night was the senior formal, but we all passed that up and headed into katmandu for a free dinner.  mmmmmm.  the problem was, we all got so drunk, well except for nia, that all we wanted to do was go to sleep!!!  so we headed home, much to nia's dismay, ("i'm NOT mad!!!") and passed the fuck out.    graduation morning.  oh what can be said.  it started with us cracking open the champagne and trying to figure out how the hell to put on our cap and gowns!!! i swear getting outta a chinese finger trap would've been easier. nia was walking down the hall, bottle in hand babbling when ooops!! there's my ENTIRE FAMILY.  she meeks out a "hi" and runs yelling "your mom is here!!! watch out!!"  at this point, i don't give a fuck if they see me drinking!!! luckily, mommy helps us all get dressed.  she even brought donuts.  so we head out to the meeting place and jaime had to go with her education crew :( but the rest of us got to sit together.  when we finally started walking, sarah repeated for about 10 minutes, "stick together guys" "guys stick together"  i think at some point all of us snapped at her.  WE'RE IN A CROWD OF 3,000 PEOPLE SARAH, WHERE DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA GO!!!  we get all nice and situated, and the ceremony begins.  i'm babbling throughout the entire thing, and right after the star spangled banner i decide to tell stacey, VERY LOUDLY, "i'm like so what i'm druuuuuuuuuunk."  yeah, lots of people besides stacey heard me considering the stadium was DEAD SILENT.  stacey got mad.  very mad.  i had to zip the lip for the rest of the ceremony.  it's kinda wierd what's happened over the past year, although only a few major things, i'd like to think i've still changed...for the better.  but i'm still depressed.  i'm a college graduate, of the college of new jersey, the best public school in the country, damn near ivy league, and i'm an auto counselor at AAA.  although i love my job, i pictured myself at a better place then this.  living on my own, making decent money, being able to stay up past 9pm.  ah, life is full of disappointments.

       sharpley sharpley sharpley   last night joseph told me that word on the street was that sharpley is getting married.  so i immediately picked up the phone and called him, but to no avail.  so as me and nia are driving to the bank today, i grab onto her leg and dig in in that, "oh my god i forgot to tell you," sort of way.  so she's like, oh man this has got to be good.  so i proceed to tell her what joseph said, and she just starts hysterically laughing.  i think you have to truely know dave s. (for stupid) sharpley in order to understand the humor in this situation because he truely is the dumbest human being on the face of the planet.  you need a special decoder just to understand his typing.  his idea of an insult is calling me a "whoer" and then saying "owww it hearts," after i rip back into him.  so after the intial laughter subsides, i pick up the phone and dial again and this time, he picks up. so after the initial hellos i tell him i heard something about him and ask if he's really getting married....  me: so i heard you're getting married. sharpley: yeah i am. me: why didn't you say anything? sharpley: well you never asked me: i didn't even know you were seeing someone, why would i ask? i don't just ask people that randomly.  sharpley: well i had to get married me: why, is she pregnant?? sharpley: no way!! but she's nicer to me then any of the other girls i know, so i had to get married. me: oh man, my cell phones breaking up ::click::  this led to me stroking out, and nia as well.  so as we're driving to pick up marissa we're reflecting onto the wonder that is sharpley and we came to one very sad conclusion.  we feel sorry for that girl.  this man called up stacey at 3am, dragged her ass outta wawa, and then peeled outta the fucking parking lot like the cops were after him.  his excuse was that, "i thought you were behind me."  don't even fucking play.  so helena, i'm sorry. but then again, in order for you to agree to marry this douchebag, we kinda have to assume that you're not the brightest skittle in the bag either. i hope that one day, when you're getting ready to have children, you put helmets on your registry because there's no way in hell those dumbass children should be let outside without them.  goodnight :)

       here's a real one for ya....   it's time for a real update folks, and there's not much to be said.  here's something funny for you though. last night i had another counseling session and i've been kind of disappointed with how things have been going so far, so i decided to steer this session myself.  so i asked her a question and throughout the 45 minutes we tried to figure out the answer together. and right at the end, she told me, "well you know, you seem the quiet angry type to me, like you have a lot of road rage."  i was like WELL YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WITH THAT ONE!!! i think it's safe to say i have just a teeny tiny bit of road rage.  hehe.  american idol has many a mockery of this competition...a mockery!!! and simon cowell has also made a mockery of stone-washed jeans.  that man has also as much as paul mccartney in his bank account, but he wears those crust ass fitted t-shirts every week and stone-washed jeans.  i'd still do him though.  the bachelor was good last night too.  i'm pretty sure he had sex on all three of his overnight dates.  i could have been 4 times, but he turned his stalker down.  i think that's best for everyone involved.  he's definitely the most man-whore-ish of all the bachelors.  he's also the hottest.  tonite me, nia, and marissa are headed to olive garden for what can only be deemed the best meal we will ever have (besides the upcoming memorial day bar-beee-que marissa's mom will be having for us).  we'll eat, we'll laugh, we'll eat, and we'll eat some more.    that's all, paul!!!

       oh blogger, how i will miss thee...   so tomorrow after i bomb the GREs i'm heading up to the poconos for 4.5 days.  i'll be back monday, don't miss me too much.  i just hope that i return to a blog full of comments.  people professing their love and desire and their anticipation for my long awaited return.  i hope that you too, have updated your own blogs so that i have reading to do when i get back.  and yes, i will honor said updates with an update of my own, recounting my magical long weekend.  until monday...  i love having fans.  someone searched double jointed woman, and my blog returned result #1.  this referral came from an interesting conversation with the jew in which she wished she was double jointed so she could pleasure herself.  my blog also came up number 1 for "wedgie pulling her underwear."  once again referring to when i gave sarah an atomic wedgie and tucked her leg into it so she couldn't move.  that then led to marissa tossing her into the wall, which she bounced off of, like a sack of potatos.  and of course, my blog came up when someone searched "greasetrucks."  nuff said.  goodbye sweet blog, i'll update you on monday.  POST SARAH, NIA, MARISSA, BETH, AND JOSEPH!!! I COMMAND YOU!!!

"come here willow...willlooowww....willllowwwwwwww....GODDAMIT GET OVER HERE NOW!!!" ok tears.  bye.

       i'll be the first to blog about this...   only because nia can't see anything that isn't 2 inches in front of her face.  being the gorgeous day that it was today, me nia jaime and stephanie headed down to belmar to enjoy the sun and the hot hot men.  we got an awesome parking spot near the best pizza place and we set up shop and starting tanning.  we went down to the water and it was rough so we went to eat.  now me and nia had been looking forward to sausage and meatballs all day, but when we went to 3 brothers, THEY WERE ALL OUT OF SAUSAGE!!!  so we went to sorano's and waited 45 minutes for our samiches which left something to be desired.  so back to tanning we went.  another trip to the water and this time the tide was even rougher.  nia got knocked down and her glasses fell off.  uh oh!!!  so she's panicking and we're all trying to grab them and she goes, "I GOT THEM!!!" and stands up proudly holding a SEASHELL.  so we're all trying to find them and my bathing suit fell off twice.  ass hanging out in the breeze.  needless to say we didn't get them.  so we headed home a little bit early so we could put in for new glasses at lenscrafters.  i helped nia save 80 dollars with my AAA discount.  yay!!!  soon me and marissa are headed out for some dinner and "strong drinks" to bennigans.  i love bennigans.    the summer's just beginning and i'm excited as hell.  this month alone is enough to wet myself.  july 4th in the poconos working (getting paid from both jobs at the same time is awesome) then ben folds on the 7th, niagara falls from the 11th-15th.  jammy jam possibly on the 16th, mike's 23rd on the 17th where he'll be dressed as lil' john.  yeeeaa-yeah.  dave matthews on the 21st in camden.  and in between all that, spending as much time with my safety blanket as possible.  lots of liquor, lots of friends, and lots of fun with my friends.  yay.

       DADDY LIKE!!   it's been awhile since those words have passed through my mouth, but last night i was in hottie overload. i bolted outta work at like 3:02. i could almost taste the sweet beer on my lips.  i went to marissa's and changed, contemplating if i could wear shorts without underwear. i did. so we're heading down 130 at 4pm and i damn near stroked out. we hit every. light. on. the. way. down. there. at one point we rolled our windows down and started cursing. it wasn't nice.  so we headed to wawa, picked up tailgating goods, and sped down to camden. we all knew it was gonna be an excellent time when we pulled in and saw the hottest cowboy i've ever seen in my entire life, belligerent, and harrassing one of the parking attendants. then we saw another shirtless cowboy with a confederate flag tied around his neck.  yeeehaw boys, yeeehaw.   we started the night off with a round of shots.  sarah:  too good times... marissa: and not GETTING LYNCHED!!!  we polished off 12 beers, a bottle of whisky, and some vodka. then it was getting close to showtime. we all staggered into the lawn section after sarah had repeated, "yeeehaw boys," about 50 times. we found beth's peoples and got our 10000 dollar beers and sat down to enjoy big and rich (??)  tim mcgraw was awesome...AWESOME!!!  they had a camera at one point shootnig from the floor of the stage up...can you say CROTCH SHOTS!!!  sooooo hot, want to touch the heinie.  sarah: i'm lit like a neon sign!!!  i'm worried for willow girl.  she's pretty sick and it doesn't look good.  but i'm glad i got to see her last night and xander's gotta be the man around the house now.  (not that willow's a man, but still)  that is all.  i'm tired.

       come out come out wherever you are   manny aka navyguy, i know you're reading my blog.  i encourage you to comment.  i've posed a question to you on sarey's blog that i want answered ;)  and another note:  i mean, i don't want to knock homemade sweatshirts.  i mean, remember that craze when you'd make a picture with single dots of paint??  i made plenty of those sweatshirts.  i never wore them to school though.  really just something to do and then shove in a drawer somewhere.  i think the thing to note here is that this girl wore her homemade shirts through middle and high school.  she lost major cool points.  so my battle with tmobile is over. i hope. zachary had enough of me by the time we hung up the phone.    on another note, tim mcgraw is tomorrow night.  STRAP ON YOUR HATS!!!

       i hate that my blog doesn't have titles...   so i'm kinda like, elated but not.  me and nia are pondering how people can change over the course of a few years.  mainly like who we were friends with in high school, and if we'd be the same people we are now if we were never friends with them.  i think it's like too hard to even comprehend because i've been friends with marissa since she was still wearing diapers in 6th grade.  i would definitely say i'm a different person cause of nia.  i mean, she saved me from a lifetime of eating lunches with jen langoski, who wore sweatshirts with horses painted on she made herself, and who won "mismatch" day in middle school even though she didn't really dress up for the occasion.  she was just wearing her normal everyday wear.  then again, the same thing has happened graduating from college.  but i guess that started senior year of college as well.  because by the time spring semester rolled around i cut almost all of my sisters out.  granted i didn't like most of them, and by the end, couldn't even tell you some of their names, so that wasn't too much of a loss.  and then after graduation we all kind of developed into adults like normal people do.  i guess it's only one person that's drastically changed.  that's just a funny ass situation which i like to laugh about on occasion.  because like, you ditch your "loyals" and then go back to hanging out with the same girls you spent a year badmouthing.  hahahaha.  whew, i needed a good laugh.  so i'm getting super amped up for this trip to antigua.  i can't figure out the exact dates yet with marissa's damn school schedule.  i think it looks like the 8th-13th for me and nia and then 9th-13th for marissa.  400 dollars, all inclusive....who can beat that!!!  i'm so excited, do do do do do do.  alright that's it.  i'm tired now.

       happy dad's day and merry schven-a-palooza   so my weekend was pretty kick ass this time around.  friday night me and nia ventured to regal to see dodgeball.  i told her to meet me there at 8, but of course she was on CP time so i had to wait in line by myself. all my worst fears about going to see a movie on a friday or saturday night came true when 19 teenagers walked in all wearing surgeon's masks declaring everyone's safety.  alas, the movie was hilarious.  my favorite line was, "you're about as useful as a poop flavored lollipop."  and nia's was, "my sweet dick that was magic!"  good times, bad pirate.  yesterday me, marissa, and sarah headed to the flea market because i'm still in need of a cowboy hat.  they didn't have any good ones there, so we gave up and went to eat lunch instead.  sarah was very well behaved, i was proud of her.  i got a disturbing phone call while we were there though....  nia: so mike just told me the party starts at 4. me: PM!??!?!??!  so i had to run home, take a quick nap, and get all hottied up (it doesn't take much) and drive down to mike's house so we could hit up this party which was name schven-a-palooza.  i wasn't really sure who schven was, or what we were really celebrating, and i'm really still not sure.  but either way, schven had a good party.  it was CATERED.  i think it was someone's birthday because family was there too.  mike ruled the beer pong table for a good part of the day while me and nia tried to remain firmly planted in our chairs when it came time to throw people in the pool.  sadly, the sponge bob slip n slide covered in ky jelly was never used.  atleast not while we were there.  yaaaawn.  long drive home, specially when you're sleepy.   happy dad's day!!!!  my dad's missing.  probably playing tennis.  which means while he's gone i should probably wrap his present.  yeah....good idea.

       the jew strikes again, again....again   sarah: you have a life! you have friends with zits on their pubes and you have a job and a nice car and will be moving out soon. and i will give you the cunnilingus anytime. and you have my blog to read for added anal pleasure. and you can take dennis. he asked about you last night. "How is  my curried lover?" It should bother me that he gets this dreamy look in his eye when talks about you, but then again, the same thing happens to me when I think about you so I really cannot blame him.

       yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwn   so every morning, i go to work, i sign on aim express, and i im nia with something along the lines of, "yaaaaaaaaaawwwwwnnnnnnnn,"  or "bastards."  especially on mondays.  but sadly, nia's not going to be in her office for the next two days.  what am i going to do all day???  well luckily joseph emails me all day.  have i ever said thank you for that?? well thank you.  i also have two magazines.  i should probably sit there and start memorizing vocab for the gres.  i took one of the practice tests they sent me and i got a 1060.  yeah, SUCKS.  i wanna pull atleast my SAT score or higher.  so i've got a ways to go.  over the weekend i did nothing.  i once again came to the sad conclusion that i'm pretty sad.  all my friends have boyfriends, and with marissa being in hawaii this week, i haven't left my house.  friday it didn't matter because i was fucking exhausted anyways so i just passed out.  but saturday i was like woohoo i need to go out, and there was no one to be found.  so i'm anxiously awaiting marissa's return so we can get into trouble together cause well, we're the only two single ones and everyone else is always busy with said significant other.  so, i guess i can say i know that feeling that certain people had a few months ago, but hey, atleast i make the effort to hang out.  and besides, i'm probably getting too big for my britches anyways cause lord knows as soon as i step foot in a bar i'm like "yaaaaaaaawn i'm sleepy," and i peace out.  ah well.  hopefully this weekend leads to more exciting things, which it should with the party at 5104 (rob.  soooooo hot, want to touch the heinie), and mike's party in hamilton.  me and nia checked out a couple more apartments yesterday in edison and piscataway.  the first one was alright, huge ass closets.  the second one left something to be desired.  then we went to the mall and stuffed our faces with reubens, i got a shirt for the upcoming tim mcgraw concert, and we discussed the "tot-stitute" phenomenon upon seeing 8 year old girls dressed up like britney spears and performing in front of some kid store, and then seeing a 5 year old in one of those micro mini skirts with her hot pink underwear hanging out.  craziness.  i'm getting tired of the green template already, maybe it's time for a change...

       he saw me nakey!!!   so i've been trying to drink a lot of water during the day which means i've had to pee a lot more.  i think yesterday i peed like 10 times.  so i'm headed to the bathroom for like the third time this morning, and the door's locked.  and being that we're under construction instead of having two bathrooms, we only have one.  so i wait, and nothing.  so i walk back.  so i wait a couple minutes, do some stuff in the booth, and try again.  still locked.  i do the pee pee dance back to the booth.  then kathy goes to lunch and i go up front.  20 minutes later i try again.  still fucking locked.  so now i'm pissed.  emotionally and pretty much literally.  i like i leaked a little.  so i dance back to cj's desk and i'm like listen, i've been trying to go to the bathroom for 1/2 an hour and someone's been in there.  so we all put our detective caps on and walk back.  the construction guys knock...no answer.  so as they're about to break in, we hear the toilet "flush" and the paper towel thing going.  ALAS, SOMEONE WAS IN THERE!!!  so the contractor joe, comes out with a sheepish look on his face.  fan fuckin tastic.  you just know he dropped more than a few cosbies in there.  so i walk in, and i'm like WHAT THE FUCK.  he definitely dropped more then bill cosbies...more like al rokers before his gastric bypass.  the toilet is fucking clogged, he left the seat up with pee on it, and there's little shit reminents floating around in the bowl.  i'm like OH HELL NO, I AM NOT GOING IN THERE.  so cj's like, well, the new bathroom should work, i'll just guard the door (because there's no doorhandle yet or lock).  so i'm like fine.  so i sit, i pee, and as i'm pulling my pants up, MR. JOE AKA TURDMCTURDSALOT opens the door!!!  i was like UMM HI I'M PEEING!!!  so i wash my hands and i'm like CJ WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU!!! and she was like i went to get toilet paper, i told yvonne to watch the door!!!  and where yvonne you ask?? SITTING AT HER DESK PLAYING A GAME!!!    ugh, embarrassment.  good pee, bad POOP.

       funny quotes from work...   linda: hey how are you?? guy with serious emphezema/breathing problem: i'm ::breathe:: pretty ::breathe:: good.  (he sounded like stevie from malcolm in the middle. joann (leans over to me): if he's pretty good, than i'm terrific!!!  (she's like 70)  it reminded me of billy madison and "if peeing your pants is cool, call me miles davis!!"  and then....  linda: there's a huge horsefly buzzing around. i would say he's one of your people, but i guess he's one of mine cause we're amish and we have horses. me: if it's hanging around you that ain't no horsefly, that's a DUNGBEETLE!!! ::linda sprays pepsi out of her nose::

       i love having a weekday off   so i had the day off today and i got a lot done.  no really, i did!!!  i drove marissa and her moms to the airport for their wonderful trip to hawaii.  we won't talk about how bitter i am that i'm in NEW JERSEY.  and then i went to kohls and bought a couple shirts and a skirt and since the towels and bathroom stuff was all BUY ONE GET ONE FREE, i bought 4 towels, 4 handtowels, and bathrugs.  i was quite pleased.  i ended up saving like 71 bucks.  then i headed to the gym for the first time in like two months, went food shopping, and then went to see another one of the apartments we're interested in.  it wasn't as nice as the first, but it was still pretty hot.  then i came home, ate breakfast, and washed/vaccummed my car.  now i'm sitting here looking at more apartments and actually some townhouses that are up for sale.  i'm gonna be so poor!!!  ah well, time to look again...  p.s.  eh...i'm not wasting my breath.

       i would update but...   see, i would update, but i haven't done anything all week.  monday work tuesday work wednesday work thursday work friday work.  actually last night marissa called me up and me and nia headed over to her house to be lazy.  after arguing where we were gonna eat, because we had 9 dollars between the 3 of us, we went to taco bell.  everything was going fine until i found a suspicious hairlike thing in my 2nd taco.  then i went to the bathroom and found blood on the door.  we peeled outta there.  i guess we should've known better when we rolled up on the teenagers playing golf in the parking lot.  we also hid one of nia's tacos and had to hear about it for the 20 minute ride home.  then we smoking the funny shit, watching porky's, and went home early.  today i'm working for deanna and then me and the nb crew (aka nia and marissa) are headed to check out two apartments we want to live in.  pray for the residents of those complexes.  THERE'S BLACK FOLKS AROUND.  if you have hate in your heart, let it out!!!  oh and i hooked myself up in big bass for july 4th weekend.  i'm gonna earn enough money in 4 days to last me the entire summer. sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.

             damn you korsachoffs....        &nbsp;   i'm trying to think of a retro thursday entry, but i can't from all my excessive drinking in college!!!!&nbsp; must. clear. mind.&nbsp; ok i thought of something.&nbsp; let me set the mood by explaining a major issue i had freshman year in college.&nbsp; right after i went to school i found out i had some female issues.&nbsp; and so in order to keep those issues in check i had to take medicine.&nbsp; but the major SIDE EFFECT of the medicine was the fact that it tore up your intestines.&nbsp; like majorly.&nbsp; and at the time they didn't have slow release like they do now, it would just hit you.&nbsp; so i spent a major part of my freshman year in the bathroom.&nbsp; my ass was permanently on fire and burning.&nbsp; nia and jaime also had their own issues.&nbsp; nia with lactose intolerance and jaime with an anal tear, but we won't go into that.&nbsp; how does that little story set the mood??? you'll see in a moment.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   so second semester of freshman year me, nia, and jaime took our rhetoric writing class together.&nbsp; and we had an interesting old bitty.&nbsp; her name was professor perdino.&nbsp; she walked with a limp/cane and she was very crabby.&nbsp; ONE TIME NIA AND JAIME WERE TALKING AND GOT ME IN TROUBLE AND THEN WE HAVE TO BE SEPARATED!!!!&nbsp; but anyway, one fatefuly day, my ass was particularly acting up and i had to run to the bathroom.&nbsp; when i came back everyone was hysterically laughing and i was confused.&nbsp; it turned out that while i was gone, professor perdino was listening to a speech and sat down in the broken desk and FELL OUT OF THE CHAIR.&nbsp; damn you bowels!!!&nbsp; you know the next day jaime put that broken desk in the same spot so she might sit in it again and fall???? yeah she's not all smiles and niceness.     &nbsp;   senior year i experienced two such interesting professors.&nbsp; not in the same semester thankfully.&nbsp; first semester i had dr. uhhh water uhhh man.&nbsp; he would use the words, "uhhh" and "ummm" like it was going out of style.&nbsp;he said he once read an article about using those words and they said it meant he was thoughtful and educated because he would pause to think about what he wanted to say.&nbsp; just because you're pausing doesn't mean you need to say something!!!&nbsp; i think a pause implies silence.&nbsp; jaime wasn't in my class but her and nia had him for adolescent and jaime once counted all his ummm and uhhhs in one single class and i think it came out to over 400.&nbsp; how ridiculous is that??? that's like one every 3 seconds!!!     &nbsp;   and then the best professor of them all.&nbsp; that was dr. what.&nbsp; i couldn't even tell you his last name because all i remember about him is the word, "what."&nbsp; he used that word like dr. waterman used ummm.&nbsp; he would be like, "and let's turn to page whaatt."&nbsp; "the test has how many whaaat."&nbsp; "and this is whaaat."&nbsp; WHAT!!! WHAT PAGE??? HOW MANY WHAT??? WHAT IS IT!??!?!&nbsp; TELL ME!!!&nbsp; i still don't know.&nbsp; i think this is why me and nia would go to the rat and pound a few beers before that class because it was unbearable.&nbsp; there was also another aspect to him that set him far apart from all other professors.&nbsp; he would wear sweater vests.&nbsp; but he didn't have a wide variety.&nbsp; so he would rotate the same 4 each week.&nbsp; so me and nia started a pool and we would guess which one he was going to wear.&nbsp; but since nia dressed him every morning she was usually right.&nbsp; that whore!&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   freshman year definitely brought new meaning to the phrase, "slice and dice," and i swear on my assplosive ass, that you've never seen a person eat a gummi bear and shit it about 30 seconds later.&nbsp; oh yes, it was bad.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   that's all for retro thursday.&nbsp; i'm tired.&nbsp; very tired.&nbsp; but i can't tell you why.&nbsp; hehehhe.

      &nbsp;  yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawnnnn.&nbsp; still tired from sunday.&nbsp; ahhh sunday, what a good day.&nbsp; it was the day of the par-tay.&nbsp; PAR-TAY DAY!!!&nbsp; it started off at 3am when i realized my brothers (brian and brian) and they're slut gf dogface (as my dad likes to call her) weren't home.&nbsp; i sent them a text msg that sounded something like, "if you don't come home right now i'm gonna slap the shit out of you," and lo and behold 5 minutes later they were inside the house.&nbsp; homey don't play.    &nbsp;  i woke up at 8am and played tennis for about 10 minutes but really it was just an opportunity for me and my dad to do some serious scheming.&nbsp; we finally nailed down our game plan and we scattered when my mom came.&nbsp; i then had to drag my brothers and dogface out of bed and get them showered in 45 minutes.&nbsp; that was damn near impossible considering my brother broke one of the showers.    &nbsp;  so then we got to the main beach parking lot and the caravan came rolling innnnn!!!!&nbsp; it was great.&nbsp; we looked like a mentally ill adult day camp all wearing the same white shirts.&nbsp; they were classic.&nbsp; on the front it said "lynne est. 1954 'aged to perfection' or is it just aged?" and then on the back they said "lynne 50 THAT'S OLD!"&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; good job aunt eileen.    so then it came time for the big surprise.&nbsp; we all drove over and tip toed around.&nbsp; yeah a group of like 30 people in the same white t-shirts walking around in a group, we were very conspicuous.&nbsp; but my mom never saw it coming.&nbsp; my dad went and got her, and she walked right past us without looking!!!! i was like "uhhh SURPRISE!!!" and then she looked PISSED because she never wanted a party, but then keith, my uncle brian, her aunt sue and uncle john popped up from the bushes and she just started bawling.&nbsp; we thought she was gonna faint.&nbsp;     the par-tay was awesome after that.&nbsp; you can't go wrong with meatballs and sausage right nia???&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; mmmm and cake with pudding in the center.&nbsp; porkbeast paradise.&nbsp;     other than that, not much going on.&nbsp; i'm working on sarey's birthday present but i'm not telllllingggggggg what it isssssssssssssssss.&nbsp; hehehehehhehhe.    ok time to work.

        IT'S RETRO THURSDAY BIATCH!!!        &nbsp;   april 12, 2003.&nbsp; the day before my 22nd birthday was marked by stephanie and richard's wedding.&nbsp; we got all hottied up and watched the ceremony and then headed to a local bar to eat some frozen pizza and have a few drinks.&nbsp; the local townsfolk were very amazed that such "high class" girls were sitting in their bar having a few drinks.&nbsp; i think what made us high class was the fact that we still retained all of our original teeth.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   so then we headed to the reception which was off the hook.&nbsp; i started double fisting whatever i could get my hands on and shoving my face full of food.&nbsp; note to my readers: this was the first wedding i had ever attended.&nbsp; the butler's knew our names after a few minutes and every they'd reload their tray they'd come straight to our table.&nbsp; i was horrified when stephanie told me that this was only cocktail hour and there was more food to come!!!&nbsp; we finally sat down at our table RIGHT UP FRONT NEXT TO THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY belting out sweet caroline because that's what the dj was playing.&nbsp; he should've known better.&nbsp; the rest of that part of the night was spent double fisting more drinks.&nbsp; whenever nia would get up i'd rattle off about 4 or 5 drinks and she would come back ready to pass them out and i'm like, no no no, they're all FOR ME!!!     &nbsp;   so the reception ending early for us because i was ready to start celebrating my birfday the right way (at the time) by heading to katmandu.&nbsp; on the way back dtm had to pull over on the side of the road because i had to pee so bad.&nbsp; damn you cocktails.     &nbsp;   so we get to kat and are stopped at the front door because nb wants to check us out, make sure we're not too intoxicated already.&nbsp; i was like fuck that, literally, and went inside.&nbsp; mark m was instructed to hook us up with whatever we wanted but at that point all i could handle was a shot of soco and lime (classic) and a miller lite (which i never finished.)&nbsp; homegirl wanted to dance but my shoes were so uncomfortable that i kicked them off and walked around barefoot.&nbsp; GROSS.&nbsp; so in true jen noronha fashion i was in the mood to make out.&nbsp; my first victim was thompson.&nbsp; he wasn't actually my make out victim, just ass grabbing and mild molesting.&nbsp; he was always my victim.&nbsp; probably cause his ass is so cute.&nbsp; this is of course while i'm on stage.&nbsp; at this point dtm had given me a pair of socks which i just threw out last week.&nbsp; they were originally white, but the bottoms were BLACK by the time i was done with them.&nbsp; so me and jaime are dancing.&nbsp; now maybe i should explain my drunken game.&nbsp; it basically goes like this:     &nbsp;   me: hi i'm jen    hot man: hi i'm (and then he can't finish because i've already shoved my tongue down his throat)     &nbsp;   so i did that four times that night.&nbsp; each man getting hotter and hotter.&nbsp; cept for the last one.&nbsp; blech.&nbsp;     &nbsp;   note to loyals:&nbsp; i bet now you don't wish you had spent the entire time out in havana because someone was feeling sick!!!     this was definitely a true moment of what my senior year of college consisted of.&nbsp; too bad katmandu is dead to me now.&nbsp; oh well.&nbsp;&nbsp; good times, cute ass (that's you joe), bad hangover.&nbsp; and of course, "I'M NEVER DRINKING AGAIN!!!"

HUNGOVER. i drove home pretty drunk last night too. i was like,  HEEEEEEEEEEEE LOOK AT ME IM DRIIVNG. i also parked my car in two  spaces and didnt put any pajamas on so i woke up as nude as the day i  was born. dennis was like, "is that what you wore to the concert"?  Next time I pick up a bottle of STEEL RESERVE. TAKE IT  AWAAAAAAAAAYYYYY. im drinking regular coke to soothe my gut. kill. me.  now. how are you?     my response: haha. i feel like dave matthews was playing his guitar right in my ear. i was quite disappointed he decided to try out all new stuff and rarely played the old. damn you dave. no more dave for me. always disappointing. bastards. i'm drinking lots of gatorade and eating a roll. munch munch.     sarah: i had the most explosvie shit ever. it was effortless. it just  exploded out of me and it was huge and smelled like steel reserve.  each time i see dmb it sucks more. it was a good nap though. i do  remember some drunk dude standing over me trying to wake me up.     my response: haha yeah!!!! blog please!     sarah: i will in a few. owww im hungover. did i miss anything good last nite?  how bad was i on the misbehaved scale?     my response: on a misbehaved scaled of 1-10 you were a 47       &nbsp;   i may have been low-balling that....

       joseph: sting is so FREAKIN' HOT!!!!   me: I KNEW IT!!! I KNEW YOU WANTED TO BANG HIM!!!   joseph: i never said i didn't!!!    &nbsp;   onto more important topics...     &nbsp;  i'm hungover.&nbsp; AGAIN.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  1 bottle of smirnoff orange   2 bottles of BOOOOONES   2 40s of steel reserve    &nbsp;  i didn't even drink that much!!!&nbsp; i mean, it wasn't like i was sarah, who passed out at the start of the concert and only woke up after i had put 3 lbs of grass on her face.&nbsp; and it wasn't like i was nia who was wandering around the concert blatantly asking people for weed.&nbsp; marissa was very well behaved of course.&nbsp; SARAH WAS NOT.&nbsp; she called me a bitch twice and called marissa FUGLY.&nbsp; now with all those ghetto black people wandering around camden selling shirts, did she not think we would try to pull off an exchange of her for a concert t-shirt???&nbsp;    &nbsp;  it would have been a pretty dead-on even exchange.    &nbsp;  oh well.&nbsp; i'll post a picture or two later.&nbsp; but for now, i must pass out on my keyboard.    &nbsp;  rearjklwrwapo;jwjipwrq[-owqrpo;isafddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

        you need to put a zipper on your mouth for&nbsp;when you're drinking!!!!     &nbsp;  that's right, loose lips struck again.&nbsp;so where should i start about this weekend.&nbsp; i really don't even want to talk about it, because i'm still so embarrassed.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; so here we go...    &nbsp;  friday night i was laying around my house drinking by myself.&nbsp; so i started bugging marissa.&nbsp; CHICKS BEFORE DICKS.&nbsp; her man was leaving anyways, so i high tailed it over there and we polished off the fruit punch with some watermelon twist smirnoff.&nbsp; rob was home entertaining one of his fast ass girls.&nbsp; he came upstairs and said hi and rolled his eyes.&nbsp; i guess she was a keeper.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  so saturday me and jew headed out for mani's and pedi's and then i rushed to get ready and headed over to marissas.&nbsp; we headed down to trenton for mike's 23rd birfday bash at his aunt's house.&nbsp; we were meeting joe at cluck u.&nbsp; i had told marissa that, but i guess by "meeting" she thought i meant, "speed past cluck u going 60mph while waving at joe," because that's what she did.&nbsp; so we made a uturn and got him and arrived shortly after at his aunt's house.&nbsp; i think my motto for that night was, "if i can't smell the vodka, it's not strong enough."&nbsp; yeah well, 3 drinks, 1 shot of tequila rose, and a few hits of the funny shit later, i'm passed out and drooling on joe's lap.&nbsp; you all know this scene well.&nbsp; the infamous spitting up.&nbsp; that means i'm one step away from another visit to the emergency room.&nbsp; luckily it didn't get that bad because in all actually i only had 3 drinks and a shot.&nbsp; this of course is where it gets fuzzy for me but what i gather from marissa, nia, and joseph is that i offered up a lot of unneeded information.&nbsp; i won't go into details.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "that's right, i tapped that ass!!!"    &nbsp;  before i became completely incoherent, i did have an interesting conversation with mike's uncle junior aka scooter brown.&nbsp; scooter brown was at the party, left the party, and came back decked out in his shaquille o'neal gear.&nbsp; so i decided i should talk ball to him.&nbsp; so i'm sitting on my lounge chair and he's sitting on the next one over and we're talking.&nbsp; and my eyes move down and BAM!!! the family jewels are hanging out for all to see.&nbsp; i was like uhhhh, i'll be right back.&nbsp; so i snuggled up next to mike and i'm like "listen, your uncles balls are hanging out."&nbsp; of course i forgot who i was dealing with, and mike starts obnoxiously screaming for scooter to put his package away!! i was TRYING to be discrete.&nbsp; and then after junior found out i wasn't married, he was all up in my business.&nbsp; but he especially took a liking to marissa.&nbsp; he was curled up under the blanket with her professing his love.&nbsp; hehehhe, i love you marissa.    &nbsp;  see, i wouldn't have blabbed so much if we didn't bust out the crew book and make mention of, "karen."&nbsp; i think that's what started it all.    &nbsp;  so after all the mess i passed out in mike's aunts basement for like 3 hours.&nbsp; nia was yelling in my ear trying to wake me up, but i was OUT COLD.&nbsp; there was no waking me.&nbsp; in fact i don't think i truly woke up and became somewhat coherent until schroeder came down to visit.&nbsp; plus we started watching freddy vs. jason.&nbsp; and then well, stuff happened that i won't talk about.&nbsp; nia is still having nightmares :)    &nbsp;  so basically i will never smoke the funny shit and drink high volumes in the same sitting.&nbsp; i should've known better than to smoke someone's stuff who was so strung out on something, probably K or coke, that his eyes were bloodshot red and bugging out of his head.&nbsp; shit was probably laced with something.    &nbsp;  so let's talk about something besides mike's party.&nbsp; maybe we should about my crazy brother who walked from my house to NEW BRUNSWICK to get his car to go sleep at his EX-GIRLFRIENDS HOUSE even though she had just been shacked up with some other dude.&nbsp; let's talk about that shit!!!    &nbsp;  or not.    &nbsp;  how about it's gorbachev vanbitesalot deathaversary.&nbsp; actually it will be his approx time of death circa 6pm tonite.&nbsp; i'll be snotting and sniffling at home by myself looking at some pictures.&nbsp; poor bastard.&nbsp; but nia is right, he lived a damn good life and not many hamsters can say that they've eaten ice cream.    &nbsp;  dave matthews concert tomorrow.&nbsp; then ocean city.&nbsp; then the prince concert.    &nbsp;  mike: i'm wearing my purple suit.   nia: we're going in separate cars.   joseph: i'm gonna look for a pair of those pants with the ass cut out.   nia: we're sitting in separate seats!!!!    &nbsp;  hahaha.&nbsp; gonna be good times.&nbsp; after that it's TOBY KEITH!!!&nbsp; red, white, and blue BARBEQUE!!!&nbsp; i'm very excited especially since there's like 12 of us going.&nbsp; yeeeeehaw.    &nbsp;  that's enough blog for today.&nbsp; it's my first day back at work, maybe i should do something.

        holy hangover batman...       &nbsp;  ugh. i feel like shit.&nbsp;i haven't drank like that in a loooooooong time, and the sad thing is i didn't drink that much!!! i think it was a combo of drinking and smoking the funny shit at the same time.&nbsp; ugh i'm never doing that again...until tuesday :)    &nbsp;  i will blog about the night's events tomorrow.&nbsp; actually i'll leave blogging about most of the night's events to joe, nia, and marissa, because well, i blacked out for more of it.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  happy birthday mike!!!&nbsp;    &nbsp;   welcome to the china club!!!       &nbsp;  on that note, it's time to take my dehydrated ass to bed.&nbsp; back to reality tomorrow!!

       another retro thursday installment...   too. many. ideas. must. pick. one.  oh that's right, i have so many ideas about what i should blog about, but i guess i'll have to pick just one.  i guess i'll introduce you to my freshman year roommate susie.  susie was a great person, really cool, the only problem was, she was always naked.  actually, there were two problems, one was that she was always naked, and the second problem was that she ate all of my food....naked.  i would come back from class....or shall i say avoiding class in nia and jaime's room, and she's be sprawled out naked, eating a bag of my doritos.  which is fine and all, but she would finish the bag, buy me a new one, and then eat that one too.  all the while, naked.  i would have people in my room (nia marissa and jaime can attest to this) and she'd come back from class or taking a shower, and just get naked.  you wouldn't even see that much bush out in a national park.  i did love her dearly though.  of course there was that time she downloaded a virus on to my computer and wiped everything out.  or how her and jaime would secretly talk behinds me and nia's back, saying we were lesbians.  no really, she was great....  i think the funniest moments we had were when she would fall out of her bunk bed.  keep in mind she was on top.  and also keep in mind, i just said MOMENTS.  that's right, she did it twice.  once when she was reaching for her pants and it was just out of her reach and she fell.  and another time when she was drunk, rolled out of the top bunk onto nia, and severly bruised her elbow.  we had to take her to derek wan's room, our community advisor, and sit her down all the while listening to his church music.  the next day we all took a nice little visit to the ER so she could have it checked out.  that's right folks, my roommate freshman year was more open with her nakedness than sarah and jaime combined.  :)  that's all for this edition of retro thursdays.  i hope you enjoyed!!!

       i really do love canadia!!!   ok so i've returned from my long trek across the border to canadia.  the drive is quite long and boring.  it wasn't until my mom passed out with her tongue hanging out of her mouth that my dad and i had a really good laugh.  i posted all 100000 of my pictures up on webshots.  if i knew the link off the top of my head i would give it to you, but i forget.  i think i left it in a post a few days back, so get it from there.  wow i'm lazy.  so here's a couple highlights: 1. niagara falls is something i'll never stop seeing the beauty in.  and this time i made everyone look at them from the new york side, which i've never done.  and you can get so close as to touch them, but i wouldn't recommend it. 2. on our first night there we watched the fireworks at 10pm and when they were over we could see firetrucks and an ambulance on the new york side of the canadian falls.  we didn't know what was up, only to find out on the news the next morning that some crazy lady tried to jump.  haha, they saved you.  SUCKS FOR YOU!! 3. me+14 other family members = constant state of irrateness.  next time i opt for canadians in LAS VEGAS!!  4. racial profiling is rampant when crossing the border.  even though my uncle, aunt, and cousin had permanent residence status in canada, we were still detained in the office of homeland security for over an hour because their passports were from dubai. 5. when an officer tells you not to come to the border and try and cross, you should listen.  because while we were in detention, the guy walked right up to the two englishmen and goes, "they're clearing a space out in jail for you as we speak."  DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN, that's rough. 6. the tour guide of a winery will reprimand you for tasting your wine before you've properly learned how to swirl and sniff. 7. I LOVE CANADIA!!!!   on another, non canadian, but sour note, i must amuse you ex-katmandu employees with some drama.  so joseph has a blog, that no one really reads except for me.  but since i put that handy sitemeter thing on his blog i've been checking it.  so i found out today that someone has searched joe surdo twice and found his blog.  and then i see the angry comment from "anonymous" on his blog.  oh yes, surdo was searching himself on the web, and found joe's blog, and then had the nerve to comment on it.  i guess he thought he was sneaky by spelling it "cat man du," but really, we've found you out.  so that is all.  i have 4 more days left of vacation.  four more PAID DAYS OFF.  oh god, i love my job.  I LOVE MY JOB!!!  and hey, atleast i didn't bore you with some random IM conversation about nothing.  and a special note for my security blanket, i missed you more than i'll ever be able to express!! :)

       I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG FUSS IS ABOOT   must. blog. before. i. leave. the. country.  ugh.  so i figured i better entertain you one last time before i head to canada for 4 days.  sweet blog, how i will miss thee.  just the other day i found that someone found my blog by searching "buttfucking women."  strange? yes.  even more strange because unless you've strapped something onto yourself, it's physically impossible for one woman to buttfuck another.  i really don't understand the logistics.  then again, i don't want to.  last night i went to sinister in new brunswick with marissa so she could get herself tatted up even more.  she picked out a real cool heart with butterfly wings.  i've determined that i'm a trendsetter.  i got my foot tattoed, and sarah shortly followed.  i got one on my hip, so did nia.  and i got one in the middle of my back, and guess what??? that's where marissa got hers.  or it could be that i have so many tattoos, i've just taken up all the good spots.  me and nia did get ours on our lower backs together.  ah yes, i have four.  and if you're lucky, you've seen all of them.  so goodbye loyal blog readers.  i'll be sure to entertain you with humorous stories upon my return.  tales that include the word, "aboot," numerous times.  ok now i'm really going....bye!

       ROCK OUT. WITH YOUR COCK OUT.   oh yes, i love ben folds.  once again he put on an awesome show.  first was rufus wainwright. snoooore. then ben came out and did an awesome show, and finished up with ARMY.  love that song.  he did a song with rufus, and finished his set with guster so their set started right away.  they were really good too, i'm glad i got to see them :)  it only rained part way through rufus and stopped in time for ben. this was of course after we were soaking wet.  so anyway, it's time to start a new weekly tradition.  i command all of you (aka mariss, sarey, nia, and beth) to participate.     IT'S RETRO THURSDAY!!!   every thursday my blog entry will recap one of the highlights of my college career.  and for today's first entry, i thought i'd tell you the story of how i got my tri sigma nickname, "dickie."  oh perverted friends, it's not what you think.  in fall 2000 me, nia, and jaime, the ZETAS (we will cut yo' ass) pledged tri sigma. we were hazed til no end.  we were lined up, marched through mud, had leaves kick at us, blindfolded, forced to memorize EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY SISTER EVER.    but there was one night in particular, that was oh so memorable.  we had been unruly all week and therefore some of the sisters were unhappy with us.  so we were lined up in our jester shirts, carrying our pledgebooks, and as we're going through everything, most of the sisters got up and left one by one.  we couldn't be like what the fuck is going on, so after everyone was gone helen told us that they were mad at us, and we had two choices.  one we could make a craft for every sister and write them songs and other random shit, or we had 3 minutes to run from kendall TO THE PARKING DECK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CAMPUS.  jaime and nia were busy contemplating, helen was repeated "2 minutes and 29 seconds, 2 minutes and 28 seconds," and i had already grabbed my shit and took off running.    nia and jaime soon followed, only to stop running at the library WHICH WAS THE NEXT BUILDING DOWN.  so i had to start dragging jaime because i was intent on making it there.  by the time we got to the chapel both nia and jaime had stopped, and i screamed "DO YOU WANT TO SLEEP TONITE!?!??! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  which somewhat perked their ears up.  by the time we go to the parking deck, and i finished lugging jaime up 3 flights of stairs, we found kristyn fucking leland and beth in a car, they handed us three envelopes, and peeled out of there.  we opened the envelopes only to find BIG/LITTLE CLUES.   this caused all of us to black out, and nia to projectile vomit into a bush.  i still get a twitch whenever i think about that night.  but that's how i got my nickname, Dickie, short for Dictator :)  this has been your first installmant of retro thursday.  hope you had fun!

       I JUST SPIT SPRITE ALL OVER MY DESK. DAMN YOU TO HELL BITCH.    today's blog title brought to you by sarah kimelblatt.  did you see the new angelic pictures of mr. wilbur???  he's satan in disguise, don't be fool by the warm furry exterior.  we taught him a new trick over the weekend.  but anyway.    last night nia and marissa came over for dinner.  nia titled it a "smorgaschbord," because that's exactly what it was.  we had buffalo chicken fingers, pork egg rolls, jalapeno poppers, meatballs, and corn!!! even my dad enjoyed himself.  the meatballs were BANGIN'!!!  we even topped all that off with ritas.  after we stopped by marissa's and dragged rob outside because we wanted to know what, "twist it out," meant and his definition, "you know, twist it out like a lawn chair," made nia spray ritas out of her mouth and all over her shirt and even her glasses.  haha, he made you moist.    tonite is the ben folds, guster, and rufus wainwright concert at penn's landing in philly and i'm super excited.  yay!!!!  i love you joseph.

       next time, strap me down and don't let me go   no really, next time i need some extra money, and i'm like hey why don't i go work in the poconos with my 4 days off, just be like JEN YOU REALLY DON'T WANNA DO THAT!!!  i promise i'll listen.  and if i don't, you can tie me to a chair and do dirty things to me.  especially jew.  ;)  so thursday i took the dreaded GREs. i impressed myself on quantitative, verbal not so much.  but still, i ended up with a decent score so hopefully i'll be enrolled in grad school come like december after i submit my application and all that nonsense.  here's my issue though, for my three letters of recommendation do i give professional references considering i'm not coming right out of undergrad, or do i have to rustle up and contact a professor who taught a class i did good in, because let me tell you, there ain't many.  i can however get glowing professional references cause hey, i work my ass off and i'm pretty good at what i do too.  so anyway after my test i headed up to the poconos, spent some qt with the hamster, and pretty much passed out.  friday i met kristin over at the office and she basically bent me over and made me her bitch for the next 4 hours.  then she was like see ya and i was like mmhmm.  saturday was picnic day and basically i did nothing.  no really.  i went to go officiate the volleyball tournament, with all of one team.  so i sat around talking to redman and then went back to the picnic, ate some free food, talked to more of my friends, and went home.  oh yes, i love getting paid to fraternize.  saturday i went out with the old school crew.  nothing says poconos like loading a keg or two on the back of a pick up truck and driving around the community drinking.  mmmmmm.  sunday was a pretty craptastic day as well.  kristin was taking advantage of my presensce (how the fuck do you spell that word.  don't answer that one joey) by disappearing for five hours.  when she showed up five hours later, i scowled at her and left.  oh that was after i took myself off the schedule for today.  it was supposed to rain, but i guess it was pretty sunny out.  who knows, i woke up and left :)  my comforter came for the imaginery bed i have for the imaginery apartment/house i haven't rented yet.  yay.  i have margarita glasses on the way too.  and a memory card for my digital.  and some clothes from old navy.  wow i spend too much money.  i guess that's why i'm cooking tomorrow night for me and marissa and my dad and hopefully nia.  it's free!!!  oh and by cooking, i mean taking something from the freezer, throwing it on a cookie sheet, and heating up those bad boys.  i missed new jersey this weekend. how scary is that. i missed my friends and my bed. i missed the lifetime channel and high gas prices. i missed my security blanket the mostest :)    no more long weekends in gouldsboro. even though i gotta drive up there again on saturday and leave my car there for a week. DAMN YOU CANADA!!!

       retro thursday!!!     this fancy new blogger will let me post prematurely. haha, prematurely. when you hear/see/think about the word prematurely do you think of ejaculation??? i do. it's a wonder i was allowed to watch the birth of a child in 8th grade health class. mrs. bright wouldn't let you watch it if you had misbehaved all year. i kinda wish i had because when she paused it just as the head was coming up, i threw up in my mouth a little.  that was kinda retro, but here's to the real retro post. i was reminded of this incident today when sarah put me on the spot and told me to recall sophomore year memories. i mean, i could write about the time sarah was drunk, barged into my room, and threatened to make my brother a man. but i won't. instead i will tell you all a story about nia's favorite towel, mr. bubbles. nia wasn't feeling well, she had a fever and a cloudy head, so her big stephanie (who's that!??!) told her to warm up a towel, and put it on her forehead. so nia, being well, slow like she is, throws her mr. bubbles towel in the microwave for 30 seconds. i think it got to 28 or 29 when i screamed at the top of my lungs and threw open the microwave to find mr bubbles ON FIRE in our microwave. see this wasn't the first time nia set something on fire. there was the aluminum foil from that hell haven, wendy's, and numerous other things that we heard go snap, crackle, and pop in that microwave. so anyway, back to mr. bubbles. he was on fire. so nia was screaming too, and we finally got the towel to go out. it smelled like toasted marshmellows in our room, our hallway, the floor below ours, the floor below that, and the 3 floors below that!!! everyone was stopping by to see whath appened, but nia was too busy in the stairwell crying in her burnt towel. it has like two big burnt spots on it. it's kinda funny, but not. she's had that towel since she was an itty bitty girl.  i told nia to blog about this, but she teared up and said she wasn't ready to talk about it. so if you have anything to add beave or zeta, please go ahead. :)

THAT IS A TAD BIT EXTREME! me: shut up! sarah: i'm just saying! is there a particular reason you packed that much? me: no! i just don't know what i want to wear. sarah: are you planning on opening up a boutique on the beach? me: shut up!!! :(  i'll be meeting boys.  and in order to meet them, i have to look hot.  and right now i can't decide what will make me look the hottest. sarah: so are you going to wear 5 shirts at a time and peel each layer off seductively?? me: I HATE YOU!! sarah: i heart you. me: i want to post this but joe will be mad.   sorry sb, but it was too funny not to.  i miss you and i love you.

       oh yeah...     and have you heard the new creed band??? it's creed minus that pimp scott stapp, and now they call theirselves alter bridge.  basically it's like trying to remake van halen with that dude from extreme.  you saw how that one ended, damn near begged sammy hagar to come back.  we'll see how this one ends...  and how come when i went to old navy on sunday to return a shirt i bought that was STAINED, they told me i had to return it to an old navy outlet...i'm sorry maybe you didn't see that i bought the shirt in NIAGARA FALLS, NEW YORK!!!  i'm not driving 7 hours back there!!! and when's the next time i'll be in philly???  UGH.  an auntie anne's pretzel eased the pain...

       numerous blog entries all at once...     so before i leave for ocean city on wednesday morning, i have to blog for the week to keep you entertained!!!  i guess the first portion of this infamous blog entry should recap my weekend.  well you all know what happened friday because i've already blogged.   saturday i worked and then went shopping with sb.  that's code for safety blanket.  i picked up sheets, a lot of kitchen stuff, a closet organizer thingie, and shot glasses.  i was quite excited even though i saw a comforter/bed in a bag at linens and things for 110 dollars less than i paid for just the comforter from macys.  but the one i got from macys is ralph lauren so that shit is gonna last for awhile.  saturday night i didn't do shit.  rob was giving marissa hell but i couldn't even move.  i passed out watching armageddon, moved to my bed, and slept for another 9 hours.  it was magical.  i've been so frickin' (to steal your word) exhausted that it was well deserved sleep.  sunday i cleaned the house up nice, and bought the matching plates so the kitchen set i had bought the day before, and i also returned that busted hamster cage i got from petco.  sweeeeeeeeeet.  too bad my dad ruined the rest of the day.  sometimes he's just so brazen and hostile that it really just makes me upset.  i couldn't even eat dinner, and it was indian food!!!  in his twisted little mind he thinks that i'm moving in with my sb and lying and saying it's marissa.  ok 1. no way and 2. you're fucking retarded.  (my dad).  so that royally pissed me off, and then i decided that it was really time to start doing things for myself, to prove things to myself, so i severed  most  ties with my sb in order to kind of, get my head straight, rediscover myself, and realize what i want out of my life.  although i could probably do that all the while keeping our relationship the same, i think my view's been somewhat cloudy for the past couple of months, especially since march 11th.  but it's time to get my head right.  i've got too much shit coming up not to.  30 more days right??  september 8th will creep up quickly.

       curly or straight???     oh yes.  last night i had a beer-b-que at my house.  all attending guests were informed to provide one solid item and one liquid.  sweeeeeeet.  we had a feast.  so me and marissa lit up the grill and made shrimp kebabs as an appetizer and also leftover meatballs!!!  but because sarah and jaime were THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES LATE we ate mostly everything before they got there.  mmmmm kebabs.  so while we were waiting we were throwing back smirnoffs and miller lites like it was going out of style and looking at potential places to live.  when the jew and my zeta finally got there, IT WAS TIME TO GRILL!!!!  so me and chef nia threw on our aprons and threw 5 hamburgers and 16 hot dogs on the grill....FOR FIVE PEOPLE.  my grill has three levels: the downstairs, the upstairs, and the attic.  so we threw the hamburgers on the downstairs, and the hot dogs on the other two levels.  ** this is key **   so anyway, flash to a few minutes later and the hamburgers are done but the hot dogs still have a couple minutes, so i tell nia to throw some of the hot dogs downstairs.  we closed the grill and merrily went back to drinking.  well, when we opened the grill 3 minutes later the hot dogs were sticking STRAIGHT UP like horseshoes!!!!  only like 3 of them, but hot damn that was the funniest thing.   so anyways, the hot dogs and cheeseburgers were banging, as were the beans, potato salad, macaroni salad.  mmmmm.  so anyway, the beer-b-que was a definite success despite sarah's lateness and somewhat obnoxiousness.  i think marissa put her in her place outside on the lawn!!!     quotes from the beer-b-que   nia: i'd have like whole snacks under my scruff!!! (nia on if she was a man and grew a beard)  7:47pm nia squirts beer out of her nose for the first time  marissa: i should have brought a change of underwear cause i'm definitely gonna piss my pants tonite  nia: left loosey righty tighty tighty whitey!  me (sitting down next to nia): promise you won't poot nia! nia: i can't make any promises nia nia (5 mins later): i'm about to brake my promise ::poot:: ahhhhhh...

      i'm starting to loathe retro thursdays...  i really am.  every week i dread thursday because my mind becomes a blank slate and i can't even recall one worthwhile college memory.  i remember little things like our drinking hats freshman year, or the closet door falling on my head, or all those drunk nights at katmandu.  but enough details to right an entire blog entry???  ugh.  i guess i'll touch upon katmandu.  i was employed at the fine ::cough bullshit cough:: establishment from september 2002-late january 2004, minus a 4 month hiatus in which i was in pennsylvania.  it was really really fun working there when i first start.  it was busy as hell and after every shift i'd change into my "slut" clothes and hang out with all my friends.  i called it the happiest place on earth.  i was so happy i worked there.  you drank for free, all the security guards looked out for you, and all my friends could come in for free and basically drink for next to nothing.  we used to go out thursday, friday, and saturday night and you could usually catch me hanging out there most other nights of the week as well.  mondays me and nia would drink the rainbow.  and let's not forget DWOW on wednesday nights.  beth and nia on TELEVISION whipped cream wrestling.  or me cocktailing for a bunch of toothless perverts.  i made most of my money from staff members who would come in and fill in the audience.  that's also how i got my first taste of bartending cause i was allowed to pour my own drinks.  katmandu was also how i met my first husband, derek jeter.  for those of you who remember mr. jeter was injured may of last year and did his rehab right in trenton, nj with the thunder.  it was one fateful night, our matrix reloaded party, that he decided that he would come in after the game.  this was also the last thursday night of tcnj/rider's semester and the outside deck was finally open.  so nb pulled me off the heineken tub and whispered that derek was coming in, and he wanted me to be his server.  HOT DAMN THIS HAS FINALLY PAID OFF!!!  i was as giddy.  when he finally got there we were roped off at skyy bar.  it's funny how like, all these people who "know" you come out of the woodwork.  my  freshman year roommate (see my 2nd retro thursday post), sigma pi boys who pissed me off during senior week (see nia's retro thursday post) and all kinds of other hooligans.  i had to be picked up and dropped into that section everytime i had to leave.  some of our own security guards would barely let me in!!! and i was serving the man drinks!! crown royal and ginger ales if you're interested.  i even called marissa and got derek to say hi to her.  YOU STILL OWE ME!!  but anyway, it's times like those i miss.  not times like the ones i had right before i quit.  i miss being crazed and hectic and so friggin busy that you didn't even have time to eat.  i mean damn, the first week i worked there i lost 8 pounds from running around!!!  senior year i spent more time working there than going to class!!  that's how much fun i had working there.  that's how i met my safety blanket :)  that's also how i met other memorable characters (though they don't compare to you) like the turkish man who wants to spear me with an arrow and marry me, the latin man in the yellow shirt, jamey johnson aka white trash, all those mexican midgets that came running towards sarah, polish, sharpley for god sakes, leverne and shirley, and many many more.  i had so many countless drunken nights there, i wouldn't even be able to count them on all of your fingers and toes.    hrmm, i guess that turned out to be a somewhat decent retro thursday.  if you have more katmandu memories to share (when it was disneyworld...the happiest place on earth!!!) you can share.  cause you know me and the korsachoffs....i forget!!!

       it's wilburs birthday!!!!     roll out the barrels, blow up the balloons, and bring the confetti!!!! the turd throwing monster you see below you is celebrating his birthday.  he's one year old!!!  that's about 38 in people years.  i know what you're thinking...38???  WOW THAT'S OLD!!!  i know right??? he's gonna need a hamster walker soon.  i remember when i got the little booger.  i had just gotten over the death of my first hamster, gorbachev vanbitesalot.  wilbur was about 1/2 the size of my pinky finger when i first set eyes upon him.  he was frisky and kept jumping out of my hand.  he didn't want me to even touch him.  well it's safe to say not much has changed.  he'd rather spend the summer in the poconos with my mom than set his beeeeeeedy eyes upon me.  so i sent him away.  ::sigh:: i miss him even though he hates me.  atleast with gorbie i could reach inside his cage and pick him up.  hell with gorbie, i could actually reach inside the cage!!! with wilbur i need the bulletproof glove.  but wilbur does know lots of tricks.  gorbie only knew how to fall off a table and eat ice cream.  oh well.  i'm done badmouthing you on your birthday wilbur.  HAPPY 1ST BIRTHDAY SWEETHEART!!!!  throw some birthday turds at grandma!!   awww look at that fluffy butt  urlLink

           this is why i love my friends:     so last night i went over to nia's because she found her nintendo while unpacking all her boxes. you know me and video games. i invited myself over. i told marissa what nia had found and she said, "OH SNAP!!!" hellloooo 1991. so anyway, while i was there i was snooping around, being nosey like normal at all the stuff she hadn't unpacked yet. so i pick up her sponge bob lunchbox and all her trolls spilled out!!! and then i saw something shiny and i found all her yearbooks!!! so i was looking through linwoods at what i wrote and i found something interesting...well not so much interesting as SAD: SHE WROTE HERSELF NOTES!!! you know how people sign your yearbooks?!??!  she signed her own!  so here are the entries:   7th grade        dear nia,      just because of you the year went by really fast. you had a good first year, at linwood.  see you next year good luck in the 8th grade      (don't get corney over the summer)      love your favorite friend,   nia    oh it gets better....          8th grade         nia,      well it's the end of the year again. another great year. yoe're  (that's how she spelled it)  going to high school. can you believe it? i can't so you can't either.        don't get corney over the summer.   nia               ponder on this!!!!

           ding dong the rat is gone!!!         that's right folks.  after 5 days of that thing waking me up at 5:30am it's finally gone.  sarah finally came to see her birthday present yesterday afternoon and i soon sent them on their way!!!  for those who don't know, i got her a short haired female hamster, all black.  i named her sheronda lee kimelblatt.  she's a jewish, black, country hamster.  i was kinda sad to see her go.  she was just starting to grow on me.  she would sleep on her black with her little pink feet all curled up.  that was kinda cute.  that noise she made when that busted wheel fell on top of her and trapped her WAS NOT!  hehe, but i'm glad things went over smoothly with dennis because sarah had mentioned awhile ago that she wanted a mouse or hamster but that dennis might not like it.  but i threw caution to the wind and got my sarey a kick ass birfday present.  hehehe.      a comment from sarey:  dennis was talking to the rat this morning. he was going "yeahh you like that corn dont you?" he likes her. are you alive? this morning i fell out of my desk chair and the chair flipped over and landed on top of me.      yes i am alive.  alive and kickin!!!!

        a sunday evening post for you monday morning readers...       so this week and weekend has been full of sarah. sarah filled week = exhaustion. but since it was birthday week, i forgive her.       birthday part 1 went something like this. we went to edo sushi for birthday dinner. i've never had sushi before, and after friday night, i can still say i've never had sushi!!! nooooooooo thanks. but i did have some good chinese food. then we went to buddy shamrocks for some drinks. $4 pitchers are definitely the way to go. sarah started with two shots of kamikaze. actually we all did. and from there drank pitchers like it was going out of style. i didn't really notice how many beers sarah had cause i was too busy playing photo hunt, but she was very well behaved. when kareoke started she made new friends with a large black woman, mama she-boo-boo for short. she joined in on, "i will survive," and watching glowingly while dennis sang, "why don't we get drunk and screw." my sentiments exactly ;) hehe. i had a very good night with my safety blanket. after shamrocks we went to prince fried chicken where sarah didn't let me down, and flirted with the men behind the counter. it was almost like we were at the greasetrucks. the ride home was interesting to say the least but i text msged marissa, even over ALL THE NOISE. bah!      birthday night number 2 started with a long ass trip to short hills mall. this ain't no ordinary mall, this is an upscale mall. sarah kept that in mind when she mooned us coming out of coach. then we all met up at the cheesecake factory and hung out at the bar while we waited TWO HOURS for our table. tell me one thing, how did i end up spending 28 dollars on TWO DRINKS and a FOUR DOLLAR APPETIZER!??!?! someone owes me some money. so we finally sat down and had some good ass food. my cheeseburger was off the heezy. sarah started becoming obnoxious but we all ignored her. i wasn't on my best behavior and i offended mike, but he luckily forgave me. things started going downhill when we got to corner tavern. sarah bought us a round of shots, TEQUILA shots, which me and nia gladly passed on. so beth and sarah ended up taking two each, and marissa had hers. i think that's when everyone started getting cranky. i was tired anyways, so me and marissa peaced right after it was about to get violent. when marissa dropped me off it went something like this:      me: maybe we should get in a fight too.   marissa: ok. I HATE YOU!! GET OUT OF MY CAR!!!   me: FINE!!!! ::slams door::   marissa: i feel much better now!      hehe. all in all a good birthday weekend. i forget quotes. but you know sarah. she's crazy!!!!
