      I found this on a fellow hnet members site:  The Harsh Reality Of Being A Hanson Fan Everything changes.  We are all aware of this fact. When time passes it tends to bring maturity and knowledge along the way to everyone it touches.  Everyone but Hanson fans it seems.  Lets take a trip back a few years to a different time and place. Back to July of 1998.  Remember those days in Albertane? Thing were different back then for Hanson fans. We weren't just a couple hundred, we were masses of thousand of screaming girls just wanting one-second of Hanson to ourselves. Most of us were young and to the most part not the maturest of people but it was different back then. We didn't stand outside the venue all morning waiting for a front row spot (grant it most places weren't general admission). We didn't shove and push other fans around. We didn't have a place we all sat around every night, discussing and dissecting every single aspect of Hanson's lives as well as our own. We were happier weren't we? Back in Albertane when Hanson was on TV weekly and the concerts made you feel at home. You were happy for people who met Hanson and saw them. You shared your stories about how you swear Taylor pointed to you during "I Will Come To You" and even thou the other person swore he did the same thing, you both laughed and pinky promised that if one of you married Taylor the other could come.  It's not the same now.  Everything's not this bright orange anymore its turned to a dull gray color. Going to a Hanson concert isn't the same as its used to be and neither is being a Hanson fan. We're not 12 anymore. We can drive cars to concerts and skip days off work and school to see them. We can afford a whole tour and travel. We can stand outside hotels all night and morning just waiting for that one-second that we might have a Hanson. That's all its about right? That one-second where you are standing next to a Hanson, where there full attention is on you at that very moment. That all the attention you've ever given them is suddenly produced right back on you. That's what we all want isn't it?  In 1998 we wanted it and in 2004 we want it even more. We want it more then the next person, more then our friends, more then our enemy's. It doesn't matter how it is but if they've had it more then you, their just compatiention to you. But in 1998 getting it wasn't easy as it is now. Going to a Hanson concert has changed. Now it's a battle of will and cleavage. It's sleeping on sidewalks in the freezing weather. It's paying off guards and flirting with them so that front row spot could be yours. It's spending all your money for that one chance and more. It's meeting them 12 times in one day but still pushing and shoving to do it again the next. It's wanting Hanson so bad and suddenly feeling that THEY owe it to you to have you be front row and met them. You're their number one fan. You've gone to so many shows, you've traveled, spent money, you've slept outside, you've pushed people out of the way, you've completely left your life at home to be there for Hanson. They owe you a second and a minute maybe. Heck, Hanson owe you a day. They owe you for being there.  You might not think it but it's true. That's how we act in line at those concerts. That's how we sound when we're whining about not being front row. That's how we treat the other fans. We don't smile at them anymore and glee over how cute Zac is and how Taylor's scarves are so funny. We send glares and we pout and make up rumors. Because we're all jealous of each other. Jealous of the second we've spent with Hanson that others haven't. Jealous of the concerts.  We wont admit it thou, that'd bruise the pride we worked so hard to have. We've worked hard on not making it seem like we care so much. We're making up rumors to cover our own feeling of jealous and hate towards people we've never even met. Some rumors are true of course. There are mean one among us. The ones that you've know have met Hanson before and yet shove you out of the way to get a picture or an autograph when you've never had the chance. The ones that tell you things like "Oh if you scream Hanson will not talk to you" but the second Hanson come out they scream. The ones that walk around with their head placed firmly up their own bootie's. The ones that claim they are "best friends" with everyone Hanson's ever talked to in their lives. Being a Hanson fan has become a competition. You suddenly have to dress sluttery then the other person so the guard will let you cut in line. You have to lie about meeting Hanson just so you can seem superior to others. You have to get to a concert a week before it starts because it's six days before the other girls will show. You have to throw the biggest fit and find the sneakiest way into their hotel. You have to lie about Meet and Greets and claim on your life you've never really met Hanson. You just saw them once for a second, that's all. You suddenly have to become everything you swore you hate, just so you can get your one-second with Hanson. And you aren't happy for anyone else anymore. You can say you are but it's not true. Someone's met Hanson once, you've met them 3 or 4 times maybe more but the second they get a Meet and Greet or Reporter or something else you speak up. But you're being righteous right?  For those who haven't met Hanson. You're speaking up and you're saying what's right. But you're not. You're speaking up for you own jealous. You're mad that person wasn't you. You're mad and you're going to blame everyone who doesn't deserve it. Because it makes you feel better knowing that at least you made that person who was so happy to met Hanson again feel like crap. Don't lie to yourself. You know it's true. You know that if your little voice wasn't telling you not to, you'd do it too. You'd become what you hate. It's a harsh reality begin a Hanson fan nowadays. We'll tell ourselves we're in it for the music but when you're standing in line for 12 hours and someone cuts in front of you, tell me you aren't screaming at her because you want to hear Hanson's music better. No, you're screaming because you want to be an inch closer to Hanson. You want Hanson to look at you and smile and get your one-second in before it's taken away by the girl next to you. You're screaming because you've waited longer in line and it isn't fair, it's just not fair.  It's not fair, you know. Us having to be like this. Having a place like hanson.net to do this in. We're all jerks on the board once in a while. We all pick fights just for the sake of it. We all post bull poopey just to be seen. We lie and cheat and throw fits and rebel because it's the thing to do. Because it'll get us attention over the next person. It'll get us maybe one step closer to Hanson. Maybe they'll see us post and they'll fall in love with us over a computer. Maybe we'll get that Meet and Greet if we pretend we're better then the other people on the board. We've screwed up somewhere in between 1998 and 2004. Somewhere along the line we forgot about Hanson's music. We forgot getting our second with Hanson is just a second with Hanson. It isn't their music. It's the music we love but its Hanson we want. It's Isaac, Taylor and Zac we turn into raving lunatic bitchs for. We've changed for the worse now. There's not going back to 1998. It's covered in rust and forgotten. We're in a new age now. We've got hanson.net to fight at. We've got a lot more ways to wee each other and Hanson off. That's not only a harsh reality but a sad one.
