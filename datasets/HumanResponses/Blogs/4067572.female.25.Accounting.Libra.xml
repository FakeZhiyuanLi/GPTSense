      so i guess you have to start somewhere...   okay... so i wanted to make this kind of a tell all sort of thing but i don't think that is necessary... i have issues... there isn't much that can't go wrong in my life... especially these days...   still need to get started on that divorce... need to get everything straight in my head as to what is going on in my life... what do i want to do... i wish there were easy solutions to some of the problems that i have... but everything seems to be so fucking complicated all the time... there has to be some way of getting organized... but anyway... enough complaining about the everyday ordinary...  i have all the characteristics of what would make a fairly boring person... accountant... mother of two... but i think that life experience can really do a lot to change a person...  need to start that divorce... did i already mention that?&nbsp;   yeah... so the divorce is enevitable... that is a fact... convincing other people i come into contact with are not so sure... it will happen though... i assure you...  just like i will be over the accident too... someday... there has to be some way of getting over one of the most terrifying things that you could ever imagine happening to you...   driving home at two in the morning you dont epect certain things to happen... everything is normal... you are actually having good things happen in your life...&nbsp;you have a new boyfriend... you are leaving his house one night and it happens... no cars on the road... dark highway... and then someone jumps out in front of your car... you are going 65 mph... that is the speed limit... there is nothing that you can do... you try to miss him... you swerve... but it is no use... you hit him... shattered windsheild... you call 911... frantic... panic... have know idea what just happened... just know that you will never be the same again... little things come out later... the guy was in an accident... that would explain why he was waving his arms... he was trying to flag someone down for help... he was dressed in drag... pink high heels... wig found caught in the airbag of his truck... that would explain why when you saw him he was in his boxers and an unbuttoned shirt... how do you get over something like that... who do you talk to... who will understand... all the shrink can seem to say is "that is an awful, awful thing"... does that really help... the drugs make it tolerable... that is for sure... one to keep you from shaking and stuttering during the day... one to make you go to sleep at night... but how do you live with yourself... you know that you have killed someone... are you the cause of the accident or was is just some freak thing... you have to go with freak thing... that is the only way to handle it... and so life goes on... you are a little more weird... a little more likely to go off the deep end from time to time...  and so you and the boyfriend break up... he doesn't like the fact that you still aren't divorced... but what do you expect... you are still friends though...   and so here i am writing in a blog... what else is there to do... life goes on... you live... you love and you listen to a hell of a lot of Modest Mouse... that seems to be what gets me by...  later...
