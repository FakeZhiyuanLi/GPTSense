      Okok.. PeepZ.. Here's d latest update.. Hmm.. *LOVE* How in da world do I describe *love*? Oh, man.. Okies, love is actually a very great feelin dat u have.. I mean d broken-hearted part SUX big time but well, luv is juz love.. If FATE is by ur side, u dun have to worry, my dear.. ChEck out dis poEm.. --->  For you I would climb  The highest mountain peak,  Swim the deepest ocean  Your love I do seek.  For you I would cross  The rivers most wide,  Walk the hottest desert sand  To have you by my side.   For you are the one  Who makes me whole,  You've captured my heart  And touched my soul.   For you are the one  That stepped out of my dreams,  Gave me new hope,  Showed me what love means.   For you alone  Are my reason to live,  For the compassion you show,  And the care that you give.   You came into my life  And made me complete,  Each time I see you  My heart skips a beat.   For you define beauty  In both body and mind,  Your soft, gentle face  More cuteness! I'll never find.   For you are the one  God sent from above,  The angel I needed  For whom I do love  Isn't it romantic? WOW! How I wish my prince charmin would send dis to me.. :'( Hahaha! ;P  Now, listen to dis part.. A poem I created all by myself.. Cinta di alam ini, Bagaikan sebuah misteri, Cintaku yang kuingini, Datanglah ke diriku ini..  Setiap malam, aku bermimpi, Setiap waktu ingin mu di sisi, Di manakah mu sayang sekarang? Di waktuku perlukanmu, oh sayang..  Putera illusiku, Datanglah ke sisiku, Aku ingin melihat wajahmu, Aku ingin mengenali dirimu..  Ya Allah, tunjukkanlah diriku, Ke arah yang sesuai, Semoga pertalian puteraku dengan ku, Tidak akan bercerai..  * a poem dedicated to my prince charmin who hasn't arrived yet *
