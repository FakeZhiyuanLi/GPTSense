        i met someone whose eyes speak of love....he doesnt need words because what he says with his eyes is so much more.......      they speak of caring ....of wanting me to be protected .....to never hurt again..        &nbsp;    i&nbsp;met someone whose touch is so comforting and strong....he makes me feel like that is what i have been waiting for..        &nbsp;    i met someone whose actions they have written so many books on........yea everything he does has been in one or more romance novels....        &nbsp;    he doesnt pretend to not be scared....no he is not those macho men....he speaks his mind.....      he is intelligent and he listens........not just with his ears but with his heart because you can see him internalise everything....as if to give it new meaning....one which is truly his.        &nbsp;    that is how he likes to think of everything around him..........as his....   &nbsp;    he makes no promises of rosy futures just says he will do his best to ensure i dont get hurt and if i do, not by him....he wants to be there for me through everything i go through.......he is a good friend...actually the best i have had so far...........        &nbsp;      &nbsp;    now wake up gal.........am bubbling too much i need to get some coffee

      today my daily fortune reads "IT'S TIME TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF AGAIN"  Before reading this i had been talking to someone about losing friends and the impact some of the friendships have had on me. And his remark was life is ever changing and because of that the people we meet and interact with are different also.  Its true that you will meet many people as you move in this journey called life........and an even bitter truth is there are people meant to be there for a short while and there are those meant to stay.  I have had a lot of friends who didnt stay long but they made there impact nonetheless........to all my friends i want to say thank you.  I would wish that all who interact with me have a favourable opinion of me and remember me kindly but alas that is not to happen because i cannot control what others think of me. And its a good thing because then you cant control what i think of you too.  I dont know why you do what you do and the best i can do is try and appreciate how you relate to me.........the rest my dear friend is your life, your choice. And in return I ask that you treat me the same appreciate what i have to offer and dont ask for much else because when you do and I cant do it...........i will walk away.......and then I will lose you.  I would wish that all those who have called themselves my friends at one point or the other will continue to be in my life for those who cant well i appreciate the impact you have had inmy life .........this weekend i learnt that we have two kinds of mentors positive and negative and from both we should endevour to pick whatever lessons are offered and use it to&nbsp;achieve our &nbsp;greatest potential.  So i appreciate even those who for any reason had a negative encounter with me because from there I choose my lesson and learn from my mistakes.   "It teaches the strong to know when they are weak and the brave to face themselves when they are afraid. To be proud and unbowed in defeat yet humble and gentle in victory. And to master ourselves before we attempt to master others. And to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep. And to give the predominance of courage over timidity.- General Douglas MacArthur, on the virtues of competitive athletics."    &nbsp;

      If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.  If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,  and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient, love is kind.  It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered,  it keeps no record of wrongs.   Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.  It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.   For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.  When I was a child, I talked like a child,  I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child.   When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part;then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.  And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.  But the greatest of these is love.

      I had a weird weekend...started on friday nite when i found myself at my aunts house taking photo's of the wedding preparations and rehearsal dinner with the inlaws.  At the end of the evening someone had volunteered me to take pics of the bride in the morning...they all ignored the fact that i had mentioned several times that i had a couple of other plans for the day and could only show up at the Reception later. Come saturday, early morning am at the supermarket shopping for gifts, well due to my mothers insistence I went and took pic of the bride. I had a chance to do some of the stuff i wanted........was going to my friend Diane's house to see her baby gal(Nicole) and visit the mum(grandma as we decided she will be called from now on)....Diane is in SA. Nicole is so beautiful. We stayed for lunch because Diane's mum had cooked but it was hurried because  i was going to take pics at the reception  I TOOK THE PICS...THEN had to leave for my usual committee meeting for Minnie's wedding.  That went well until everyone decided they arent hearing any excuses I have to join them for drinks later... There goes my book and an early nite.  we went to Tamasha....where for about two hours it seemed like every man wanted to hit on me..... can it get any worse  YES Some guy ...comedian type...in that he thinks he is funny..comes to sit next to me.....this guy cant keep his hands to himself.....it took so much effort not to hurt him because his pal is friends with the bunch that brought me there.....the guy has a stupid grin on his face and keeps staring at me and saying nothing.........and he had the nerve to ask for my number..  then this guy comes and he is talking to everyone..........Really Loud guy........he was like huge....  THIS STORY IS TOO LONG....TELL IT LATER

      If you have read this book "title above" you will realise how true it is that man really does make his own destiny..because your thoughts mould your life. Henry Ford said "the man who thinks he can do something and the one who thinks he cant are both right"  Our greatest power lies in our thought, because this thought are what we believe....OUR FAITH  My goal to have a nice day every day..how by waking up happy and concentrating my thought on what is positive about all that happens to me.

        So, then, to every man his chance -- to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining golden opportunity -- to every man his right to live, to work, to be himself, to become whatever his manhood and his vision can combine to make him -- this, seeker, is the promise of America.- Thomas Wolfe          The best fortune is found within your heart!

      today has been a interesting day........forget the fact that i came to work late and that is not good when you just started at a new department/region. then the stuff am doing is totally strange and i have no actually guidance so am running around like the proverbial headless chicken......... am asking too many questions and feeling really stupid. i have no office....because there is no space in the finance department....so am sharing the library with this auditor guy from SA who is always smiling most times he creeps me out.  actually used to creep me out after two days with him no way.........i have seen all the facial expressions a guy could possibly have when looking at a spreadsheet.  now am suppose to be meeting with my boss but no he wasnt done with some stuff so he told me to wait...........hallo what does this guy think he is... he has uprooted me from an office where i had a desk and a functional computer and drawers for my stuff and an phone extension that is not shared by ten guys....then now i have to work late..  anyway though, my day was good.......am enjoying the fact that am finally working with numbers and the library is not so bad i can read a different book every three days and i always know which nice books have been returned...........especially the ones the bosses are reading....  then am so far from the tack shop no snacking during the day..........hahahaha am bound to lose weight...right now even two kilos wouldn't be too little..........HELP overall nice day.........now am going to hassle this guy i need to leave at a resonable hour.

      "i love this man he is everything i have wanted....heck i didnt even know i wanted the stuff he does for me" "he is married and no he doesnt have a bad marriage, infact he would be quite happy were he able to figure out why his wife isnt herself since she gave birth....we spent sometime talking about this and he thinks maybe she doesnt feel appreciated enough...i asked him to tell her how much he appreciates her and he says it doesnt seem to be enough so we agreed he should take her out to dinner tonite"  "this guy listens to me like actually listens, he will remind me of something i said to him while drunk .......most of the time is stuff i wish he would forget, like the first time i said i loved him and stuff and all the questions i ask........and he tries to find solutions to my problems as if they were his...you know men like this arent easy to find especially not for those of us with really high standards"  As i sat and listened to my friend tell me about this new man in her life who she totally loves....i asked myself alot of why's... She is beautiful..like really, intelligent and so far as career she is doing really well so she has the money.......(that writes off the sugar daddy theory). My conclusion was this woman wants to be cared for and respected by someone who sees her not as a just a beautiful woman trying to make it in the world...but as an intelligent being who has something to say.........  I was particularly amazed at the guy taking his wife to dinner at his girlfriends advice........yea she told me he called before leaving the office to say he was going to freshen up then go for dinner. This is not a man who is just out to get sex no its someone who was probably in need for a friend....someone he could talk to and one who would hold his confidence and someone who would give back valuable input.....and maybe he didnt know it just as my friend here admits she didnt think she needed anyone.   it also brought me to another thought .......how many of us really know what we want from life, from our work, from our family relationships, from romantic relationships....   how many would sit back at the end of the day and say i achieved what i set out to in the morning?   how many woul dbe able to answer "what is your purpose in life"?   dear friend when you take time to listen thats when you find all those answers............      my friend has found happiness.........atleast so she says and am truly happy for her, because she worked so hard for everything else she as, i think she deserved this one thing.......having someone who truly cares........so what if he wont always be there, the memories stay with us.  and after all not all friends are for life.......some are for a reason; like teaching you how to love, other for a season; to take you through a hard time, and other though few for ever.   LETS APPRECIATE WHAT WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE IT AND LETS LEARN FROM LIFE...LIFE IS SUCH THAT WHATEVER EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE IS BOUND TO TEACH SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VALUABLE LATER. so lets embrace life..and its lessons...for its in this that we find wisdom.
