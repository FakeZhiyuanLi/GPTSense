       urlLink    urlLink     Not a very nice picture. Taken 2003 when my patient died prematurely of Hydrops fetalis. This is the autopsy. Note the chopping board. It was not my fault!! Honest!!     urlLink    The autopsy  urlLink      urlLink    The autopsy2&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Post autopsy&nbsp; urlLink     A while ago, I tried out the mms feature of my phone wherein I experimented in sending this archived pic.  When looking at the picture: 1. Remember that before you barf or faint, this was a person albeit a premature one, who died because of something we can control. Well, the mother can quit her drinking, smoking, sex and other vices that can harm the fetal development. Plain cause &amp; effect. But sometimes, due to a cruel interplay of random selection which we cannot control, tragedies such as this can happen.  2. Just because something is as assaulting as this pic, doesn't mean it has lost all of its moral ground. Autopsies are just a normal procedure in the medicolegal field- it's not advertized, that's all.  3. The picture is to document the pathology involved so with more research on the disease can decrease its incidence. This is neither to mock nor to dehumanize the dead patient, but rather to scientifically record his short existence without malice or prejudice.  4. Respect for human life begins in understanding its secrets.

       Le Chatelier's Principle: "Complex systems tend to oppose their own proper function."     I, Robot  is the new movie starring Will Smith involving him in the "man against the machine" theme melded with the question of Darwin's evolutionary survival. The twists involved are obtuse, while the plot is linearly predictable which makes this film not that "spectacular" or memorable but with it's flashy visual effects and cgi animations, this makes the movie a notch below  Minority Report . Though linear, the mystery and the fast pacing keeps you at the edge of your seat. The dialogue is cliched and very very hollywood with all their pregnant pauses and their saccharin expressions- well what do you expect with a high-budgeted sci-fi schlock from tinsel town? However, the advantages outweighs the downsides.  The action and the thrill of the chase keeps your eyes on the screen.   I give it  7.5/10 .

      I went to Robinson's Place today with Jorin and watched "King Arthur." I just realized the following:  1.  The higher the budget for any historical fantasy Hollywood film is directly proportional in terms of the cheeziness, crappiness, corniness and stupidity of its acting and characters.  2.  That any Euro-historical film done in English will sport that bloody English accent. No exceptions noted.   3.  The more fantastical the story is, the more fantastical is the logic of its actors. Imagine just staring at your enemy when the ice beneath your feet has already cracked off. ... Or indulging in a piteous caterwauling of a speech about freedom, friendship and other stupidly profound subjects just as when the enemy is about to attack your fort.   4.  You see one Roman-themed film, you've seen them all. If Maximus in Gladiator sported an impassive poker face, so will Artorius (Arthur) but more crappier. If you've seen Legolas, the elves, & Helms deep, then you will find it refreshing to find them recreated in King Arthur.  5.  The "wear & tear" of costumes of historical films (especially Roman films) corresponds to the number of days of shooting. Roman armors after "so-called" countless battles remain spotless without dent or wrinkle. It's already bad enough that the acting is so fake.  Don't believe me? Go watch it!  Also,  6.  The person two seats beside you clad in sando will intermittently expectorate into the floor fronting him. And you think these things do not happen. Only in the Philippines. People think that their P75 ticket aslo bought them the right to trash the place. ***sigh

      I definitely have the colds. My eyes can't stop watering and my sinuses are clogged with a mountainful of mucus. I already took Tuseran and Biogesic but it seems it's not that effective. Well, I should know, shouldn't I? ***sigh*** Mostly it's viral so all treatment is&nbsp;therapeutic and symptom-based. Good thing, there were Sylvanas in the fridge. Mmmm!  Got a pirated DVD from ol' trusty Quiapo. It's called "Mishima" which is primarily based on the life of Japan's most prolific and distinguished post-WWII author, Yukio Mishima. I thought at first, "Ah.. Japan.. my homeland... anything from there is good." I guess I was mistaken, 'cuz the film itself was too "poetic" that watching it akins to appreciating paintings by Mir√≤ or Basquiat in one sitting. One, it was boring and bereft of anything "samurai" unlike the films of Kurosawa. But pettiness aside, the film is a wonderfully made and sincere portrayal of the author-schizophrenic. The music which was composed by Richard Glass is very haunting and appropriate for Mishima.

      I dunno what the hell's happening but suddenly (more like the whole afternoon) I feel as if&nbsp;I was&nbsp;going down with&nbsp;a cold. Good thing there's Paracetamol around because at least in this way, the symptoms won't be as bad. Most&nbsp;likely, this is just a viral&nbsp;infection so antibiotics&nbsp;are out of the question (for the time being.)&nbsp;But damn, that feeling of fatigue, heavy eyes, raspy throat, and increased frequency of sneezing, makes the condition worse than it seems.   Nana, Raprap and I went to Robinsons Place today to buy some groceries. Goodness, the prices have skyrocketed so much that our one cart-full of groceries (mainly veggies, meat,&nbsp;toiletries &&nbsp;household items) costed us like 3k. When I was still in college, say 1998, P1,500 worth of goods are already sufficient for the monthly use. But now, our peso value has sunked so much that it is not worth anything at all. Your P100 can now only buy a couple of items, unlike then, when that kind of money can already buy a family-size pizza.   I also bought an internet card from Mega store near National bookstore. I was rudely awaken last night by the sudden disconnection of my presumably unlimited PLDT Vibe postpaid internet line.&nbsp; Reason? Well, that fucked-up company said that I overused over P2k worth of internet hours, consequently, my account was blocked until the 1st of the next month REGARDLESS of PAYMENT&nbsp;of the&nbsp;BILL FOR THE CURRENT MONTH! So, I asked that since I paid my bill for this month, won't the usage also revert back to zero? The guy said, "No sir, regardless of payment made, usage is charged from the 1st of the month." Huh? So, what's the use of paying on time? And furthermore, why don't they&nbsp;inform the users that such can occur and will occur regardless of loyal payment of bills? Just to show you that logic and reason here in the Philippines is and ever will be skewed.&nbsp; It's not very customer-friendly of them to treat its&nbsp;customers this way.&nbsp; So right now, I have to contend myself with a trusty anonymous internet card and an upcoming sniffles. Pass me the Tempra, will you?   Ahh... be sure to check-out this satirical site (Thank God for small miracles!):   urlLink http://www.pldt.com

      I am really not that fond of artfilms at first because of the lack of exposure and the availability of materials in local video rental shops. It's true! Go to any decent video shop and ask if they have, let's say,  Amelie , most of the time, they would only shake their heads faster than a tree shedding it's leaves in autumn. It was the Hollywood schlok that ruled the nest. Even during the vcd era, there were not a lot of artflicks other than the asian horror genre.&nbsp; Back then, it was what?  Ringu, the Phone, Pang Brother's The Eye . But that was it. &nbsp;It was only after I got hooked on dvds that I learned to appreciate artfilms as a whole. The first film i bought was  Cuaron‚Äôs ‚ÄúY Tu Mama Tambien" , followed by ‚Äú Crime of Padre Amaro ", and the rest was, well, history. The amount and type of dvd artfilms available depends on what the quiapo bootlegged dvd market supplies. There, you can buy any artfilm for P65-70, which is also the price of watching a hollywood film in, let‚Äôs say, Robinson‚Äôs mall. If you go there, just ask for the foreign films. They would say, ‚Äúboss, poren? poren?‚Äù Because foreign films are hard to come by, supply for it is small even if the demand is huge, so a full supply of  pasolini‚Äôs ‚ÄúDecameron‚Äù  dvd now will be no more in less than a week. I vascillated, so I wasn‚Äôt able to get a copy. damn. I mean, if you want to go treasure hunting for artfilms & classics, quiapo is the place to be. It‚Äôs what people in internet threads call ‚Äúthe dvd lair", so most probably you‚Äôve gone there too. =)  &nbsp;  A week ago, i went to  Quiapo  (Ahhh... that veritable ghetto for everything illegal) and bought criterion collection‚Äôs ‚Äú Seven Samurai ", ‚Äú L‚ÄôAppartement ‚Äù and even the disgusting ‚Äú Salo .‚Äù Talk about luck. and you won‚Äôt find any originals in Astrovision or Odyssey. So, who says we must not to patronize piracy when in fact there are no original counterparts for artfilms being sold in legitimate stores? And besides, though I don‚Äôt advocate pirating Philippine films, piracy of arthouse films brings movie appreciation to a higher level wherein the masa can now appreciate reading subtitles. And besides, collecting these films is a good way of building my own filmlibrary or archive since the pirated dvd copies are quite good and the quality seldoms depreciate over time unlike vhs or vcd.&nbsp;Suddenly a thought of guilt ran through my brain, but thankfully, looking all those neatly stacked up dvds pushed that thought away. What a relief! Long live DVD piracy in the Philippines!!

      Thank God I found this site.... a new blog a new beginning. There have been blogs for which I am a habitue of like Demented  urlLink http://demented.so-phobic.com &nbsp;where a small circle of close friends update themselves with their daily grind, and a group blog in Yahoo groups composed of retired CAT officers also whooping about their daily grind. Ugh!  &nbsp;  But now! Mwahahahahah! Mwahahahaha! I have my own blog where I can shout to the world! I can now hear Dr. Frankenstein in the black&white background say, "Igor! It's Aliiiive! It's Aliiiive!!" And so, without much further ado, I hereby declare this blog officially open!  &nbsp;  clap! clap! clap! Thank you! Thank you!

      During my  Bacolod  years, my grandma whom I shared the room with (yes, hers was air conditioned so 'twas better that I sleep in her room!) sometimes reprimand me when I tinker with her TV saying, " Nunca pahilabti ang TV basi mapierde ina karon !!" Any Ilonggo can understand that statement perfectly well which reads, " Don't even try to disturb the TV for it may "lose it's efficiency" later on ." For us in the province, we were not acutely aware that our tongue was peppered with  Spanish words  or  Hispanicized Ilonggo.  We just took it for granted and assume it's vernacular Ilonggo.  Coming to  Manila  however made my senses more acute since I have to shift to  Tagalog  when speaking with people. (I hate code switching!!!) It seems that many words here are of  Malayo-Austronesian  in origin while the same counterparts in Ilonggo are usually Spanish loaned. For example, the word for " open/to open " in Tagalog is " bukas/buksan " while in Negros, it's the Spanish " abri/abrihan ." Another is "meanwhile" wherein in Tagalog it's " habang " while in Ilonggo, it's "mientras (while) or mientras tanto (meanwhile)."  Some of them are as follows: [English- Tagalog(vernacular)- Ilonggo(vernacular)- Spanish] 1.  Eyeglasses -Salamin- Antipara,Gapas -Antipara,Gafas 2.  Gun -Baril- Pusil -Fusil 3.  Teacher -Titser,Guro- Maestro,Maestra,Titser -Maestro,Maestra 4.  Lose -Talo- Piyerde -Pierde 5.  Cheap -Mura- Barato -Barato 6.  Change -Sukli- Kambyo -Cambio 7.  Dance -Sayaw- Bayle -Baile 8.  Key -Susi- Liyabi -Llave 9.  Clean -Malinis- Limpyo -Limpio 10.  Until -Hanggang- Asta -Hasta  I don't know whether I should feel proud or happy or ashamed about having a more colonial tongue. It doesn't diminish though my love for the soil of my forefathers. Yeah right!! Soil, my ass!! I guess this matter is inconsequential and moot, not worthy of killing my remaining neurons. But it makes me wonder though. Is development or the dynamism of a language determined by the progress of its users? Has Ilonggo stagnated itself into the nostalgia of the past? I hope not. Tagalog seems to have more English incorporated into its vocabulary than any other Philippine language, probably due to the fact that it's the country's major port- an entrepot of global influx. Whatever. Basta, it's moot and academic. Urgh!  Oh well...that's it.... no more neurons to burn.

      Wow. This reality show sure is fun!! Not only you get to see the  Pyramids, Catherine's Palace in Russia, the Nile, Kilimanjaro , but you also see the pairs struggle their wits as they pass each challenge whether it may be physical (pulling a huge block of Pyramid stone 50 meters using no wheels), gastronomic (eating 1-kg of caviar in a hurry) or mental (block ice hockey pucks 5 times). The tests are ingenious and never boring and the contestants are really funny (with all their sarcasms, double-dealings and insults) but not to the point where you get irritated by them. This is so unlike  Survivor  where you were stucked in a never changing island full of whiny, lazy, spoiled inconsiderate ugly Americans who do not know how to cook decent rice doing nothing all day except scratch their folliculitis-infected bottoms and conspire to smilingly backstab their groupmates.  When you watch  Amazing Race , you heart goes tachycardic (>100 bpm) and your skin become diaphoretic (sweaty) from watching the hurried & harried faces of the contestants who are all under time constraints. The visual &amp; aural stimuli are tremendous, resulting with you wanting to watch more. Better than Survivor.    Update:   They're on the way from  Tanzania  and going to  Dubai, UAE  next week. And the whiny cousins  Mirna and Charla  (people call her Shmirna) are thankfully eliminated. Note how loooong Mirna's hug with Phil! And Charla's speech made  Phil Keoghan  choke! hahahaha...  ;P I pray that somewhere in Dubai,  Colin & Christie  will be ambushed by Taliban Ninja Fighters or something.  And I pray that cool  Chip & Kim  wins this so amazing race!!! They have the class and the decency that no other team has. Isn't it ironic that it's the white pairs who are showing how ugly Americans are?  Cheers!    Next Week:   Colin goes to jail!!! Yahoo!!

           A Midsummer Night Lullaby by: Julsitos  Now rest your eyes, my dearest child, lay upon your mother's breast, and feel the warmth, so sweet and mild, your peaceful face gently pressed.  Hush little one, the day is done, for you are in my keeping. The ills of yesterday now begone its secrets now asleeping.  Can you hear the crickets playing, hidden 'mong the grasses there? Can you feel the wind whisp'ring blowing through the midnight air?  And when you yawn, your face alights without a care or worry. To dream in splendid perfumed nights, is paradise and glory.  In the darkness of midsummer not a stirring, child and I, for in sleep we sleep together, and dream beneath a moonlit sky.

      Don't you just hate it if you have a  writer's block ? I mean, when your head is out of ideas to churn out or the words are lost in the air. There is some grain of truth to what "spiritualists" say about writing. They theorized that creativity (writing, painting, composing, etc.) comes from inspiration, and this inspiration is possible because our "spirit guides" or guardian angels send these signals or ideas for us work on.  I wonder if seasoned authors get such block. If they do, here are some of my take on their works:  Can you imagine  J. K. Rowling  of the  Harry Potter  series if one fateful day she was stricken by the bug? She might chuck it all up ala the painter Paul Gaugin and decide that she is getting tired of Potter that she instantly have him and Hermione elope for good. Well, if she wishes that Ron shall enter the fray, then they could have a menage-a-trois. If I were Rowling, I would suddenly have the wicked urge to end the saga in the middle chapter where Harry will have a heart attack and due to an earthquake, Hogwarts shall crumble down and kill everyone to smithereens. Yes, even incontinence-stricken Dumbledore dies because the dumb Dumbledore was on the act of changing his adult diapers in the lavatory.  The Horror!  How about the  Da Vinci Code  by  Dan Brown ? Doesn't he get the writer's block from time to time? He might have been tempted to end the chase then and there at the villain's house but since he is so well into the novel, we get a hundred pages more to read. Wouldn't it be funny that instead of the couple finding all those clues in the Louvre, the sprinkler system kicked in and washed away those written messages leaving Langdon and his mate clueless as ever. Or what if the zealot monk decided to hijack the private jet and as a protest to Bush's War of Agression, he rammed the plane into Big Ben just like Sept. 11? Such would bring a smile!  So, after writing this rant, is my spotless mind still blank? Positively so!

      There was an article about a week ago wherein the government announced that the  air in Manila  is at par with world health standards. What tha? Have they gone that stupid from testing air quality here? To think they are "college" graduates"! I guess a degree does not gurantee intelligence, that's fer sure! There are only two conclusions to their disinformation: one, it's just the government's run-of-the-mill white propaganda (more like  puro pampaganda ) or two, their air quality gathering equipment is so decrepit and obsolete that any result coming from it is off-tangent. Probably, the air quality they were investigating were those of Mars or Jupiter. Most probably from Uranus! Geez. They think Filipinos are that dumb not to notice their celestial results.  If their quotations cannot be trusted, whose then? Simple. Our boogers!  Yes! Our booger, kulangot, pong-it, or snot is the best indicator of air pollution levels in Metro Manila. Not only it is free and easy to get, it's natural!!  How? Just at the end of day, pick your nose and collect a sample of your daily remnants. Then, rub it in between your fingers until you get a nice homogenous consistency in which you then compare it with a corresponding color chart that shows the present pollutants in the atmosphere. Easy, no? It's better than to trust some ambigious result doctored by the DENR. =)

      Louie, Enna (both batchmates & interns at Manila Doctors) and I watched Collateral at Robinson's Place Manila yesternight. I just settled for White Cheddar popcorn and Ice tea from Tater's to make my viewing pleasure more palatable.  Watch out! Random spoilers ahead!  For a complete synopsis, check out this site:  urlLink  Collateral from themoviebox.net      To make the whole gamut short, the movie was too fast and furious. Tom Cruise's timely end was anti-climatic but there were good chase-and-run scenes in the end. The premise as the assassin is satisfactory but the premise on why he's killing those people is at most, murky. His acting was Hollywood-like as always, with posing-posing, pregnant pauses and cowboy dialogues, but he managed to pull everything off in his favor. But I have to praise Jamie Foxx (Max) who played the cab driver to was coerced into servicing Vincent in his game of "sutukil" (shoot-to-kill). Max's acting was brilliant- the way he was panic-stricken by all the lightning speed events happening around him and his change of character from the optimistic coward to the fatalistic hero. His emotions were neither melodramatic nor exaggerated but were on the other hand, befitting for someone in the edge of being shot, not to mention that his complicity to Vincent's job made him a "black" accessory to the crime. I simply enjoyed the look on the driver's face when he was told by Vincent to retrieve the list of victims from Felix. His face became white from fear. Hahahaha.  Collateral, while a good cat-&amp;-dog film, gave me migraine. I don't know if it was from the popcorn or from the drink, but I'm sure all those exploding car chases, blair-witch carmera shots, and those endless running contributed to that throbbing feeling inside my head.  Soooo... I rate this movie: One thumb up!!! Yipee!! (Cuz the other thumb is on my cell's keypad texting!)

      I just arrived from  Malate Church . It's one of my favorite churches and attending their Sunday masses is sheer joy. More like inner joy.   The priests there are mostly  Columbans  who primarily are  Irish . I find their presence very humbling (imagine leaving their homeland just to spend the rest of their lives here in the Philippines) and inspiring (for they're very active in community works.) Their experience in poverty-ridden Negros during the 1980s' "years of famine and insurgency" strengthened their faith and resolve in propagating the Catholic faith through example. This in turn, makes their words effective in touching the heart. They seem to be surrounded in an aura of holiness which is very effusive and infectious.  Their sermons are conscience-hitting steeped in suffering and hope, love for the poor and the sick, and most of the time they talk about our obligations as Christ's children to our fellowmen and our duties to Christ himself. Their sermons are based on their experiences with the people of Negros, and not on lofty abstractions that only theologians can relate. What they have is  heart  and hearing their words can bring about the conversion of one's soul.  (The question is: Is that change going to last as soon as you leave the Church?)  Because of their zeal and their holiness, the Columbans of Malate are highly respected and loved by their parishioners. A very good example can be seen right after the mass. It's only in their church where children, as young as 3 and as old as 30, approach the priest to make the "mano" sign. You can feel your heart being tugged as you watch the priest being delayed from leaving the aisle by hordes of people jostling each other so they can all make "mano." Such a sight is far from the hatred and animosity felt by Filipinos for the Spanish friars- but that's another story.  However, I am disappointed with some of the parishioners. Why?  They leave at the middle of the mass.  They prefer standing up and taking a bow right after the sermon or after eating the holy host. What on earth people think this is? A movie house? A play? A theater? Do they think this is not worth finishing at all? Do they think they can just leave without saying goodbye? It's as if you simply left the banquet table without letting the host know that you're leaving. I don't want to sound sanctimonious or oh-so pious but finishing the mass is the least you can do as a sign of respect for the faith and the religion you are affiliated with. If you really believe your faith can save you, then at least, give it the proper attention it deserves.   Sure, sure, there's that clause which says, we humans have the "freedom of choice." Well, freedom of choice indeed! Blah! Blah! Blah! Rationality sucks sometimes.  Oh well, just another Sunday blues.

       Angels & Demons (Dan Brown, 2000):  Hmmm... still on the first chapter. But nonetheless, it's as good and fast-paced as the The Da Vinci Code.    The Decameron (Giovanni Boccaccio, 14th Century):  To think that Medieval Literature is boring, this should dispell any notions. Thanks to  King Arthur, Chaucer, Thomas More, St. Augustine , etc., we tend to think of Medieval lore as painstakingly boring and full of old English yarn. We conjure ideas of princesses with pointed hats being rescued from dark castles by prince charming, or the Robin-hood like chivalry and cavalierism during those times. However, we must remember that the Black Death ravaged most of Europe during the Dark Ages. Not everyone is in the church praying and kneeling before the pews feeling pious.  This classic shows the bawdy, humorous, satirical and farcical side of the Medieval Era. It's not about noble knights searching for the holy grail or battles fought for love (ala Romeo & Juliet) or philosophical monarchs going murderously mad (ala Hamlet & Macbeth), but rather it's the daily activities of the common people of Italy. I have to admit, most of the population then were poor. Most of the time they eat, feast, get laid, blackmail, cheat, murder and get drunk... just like today. You agree, GWBush? I can see you nodding your head Erap.  After seeing  Pasolini's The Decameron , I simply have to check if the film was faithful to the original manuscript. Well, mostly yes.  The blurb from  Dover Publications :  "While the Black Death rages through 14th-century Florence, a group of young people retreat to the countryside and amuse themselves by telling tales of romance and adventure.  This is the premise of Boccaccio's Decameron... Vast in scope, teeming with colorful characters, and rich in worldly wisdom.  Folk tales, ancient myths, fables and anecdotes range from earthly and irreverent satires of hypocritical clergy, to gripping tales of murder and revenge, to stories of passionate love, both adulterous and faithful."   Some of the stories from  The Decameron :   Ninth day, Story II : An abbess rises in haste and in the dark, with intent to surprise an accused nun abed with her lover, thinking to put on her veil, she puts on instead the breeches of a priest that she has with her: the nun, espying her headgear, and doing her to with thereof, is acquitted, and thenceforth finds it easier to forgather with her lover.   Third day, Story I : Masetto feigns to be dumb, and obtains a gardener's place at a convent of women, who with one accord make haste to lie with him.   First day, Story I : Ser Ciappelletto cheats a holy friar by false confession, and dies; and having lived a very sinful life, is, on his death, reputed a saint and called San Ciappelletto.

       urlLink    The hidden location of the pirate's lair. Just go into Arlegui Street.; urlLink     Hmmm... And so the plot thickens. This is one of the entry points to the infamous  Quiapo DVD market . From the  Quiapo church , you have to cross the underpass to the other side of the avenue. There, you can ask for directions or better yet just follow where most people are going. Here,  Arlegui street  poses as one of the less crowded access to the fabled stuff. Just go straight. Do not panic if you see a cop because as far as anyone with an IQ higher than 90 knows, they are frequently batting a blind eye to this seemingly illegal trade. I think their philosophy is that as long no one is hurt, killed, maimed or kidnapped, then everything's well.    Caution:  Do not bring lots of cash, or credit cards for that matter. Do not show off your cellphone in public, or use it in the streets.  Do not wear expensive watches or jewelry for they can become targets for street pickpockets. Do not wear formal clothes because Muslim merchants are wary of giving discounts to co√±os. Furthermore, do not make any snide remarks ala GWBush about Muslims because you won't get any discount that way. (I was about to write "you won't be able to escape Quiapo alive if you do insult them.")   urlLink    Inside one of the many alleys in DVD country; urlLink     There are lots of places to start. And you have to be discriminating with your choice of DVDs. Just don't take it as it is because if something is wrong with it, it can be very difficult to return it back for exchange. There are rows and rows of DVDs and with luck, you can stumble on rare titles (like the works of Paolo Pasolini & Kurosawa), or better copies of unreleased films. The DVDs are stack on shelves upon shelves extending from the floor to the ceiling. When they say DVD copy, it means it was copied from the original, but when they say "Clear copy," it means it's not worth buying the disc yet.   My routine:  1. Check for the titles. 2. Check for scratches and defects on the shiny side of the DVD. 3. Have you choice be tested on their DVD player. 4. Haggle. Currently, it's P70 ($1.30) per disc. If bundled into three purchases, you can get them for P65 ($1.20) each. 5. Make sure they stamp/mark the DVD title insert, so if you return them, you can argue that it was from their store that you've bought the disk from because if not, they can play that Shylock argument that you "might have bought it from other stalls."   urlLink    An otaku shopping for anime; urlLink     There are lots of films to choose from. Just remember to have the presence of mind on what to buy and a limited budget for your trip, so that you won't indulge on impulse buying. It's difficult to control oneself once you're there, especially if you have been afflicted with the shopping bug.   Many of the films being peddled in Quiapo are:  1. Unreleased Hollywood films      a. copied from a promotional disc     b. copied inside a theater 2. Released Hollywood films (copied from the original DVD) 3. Classics (Hitchcock, Kurosawa, war movies, etc.) 4. Arthouse films (infrequent, scarce supply, rare titles) ex. Criterion collection 5. Asian foreign films (Korean, Japanese)  Raids are frequent in Quiapo. However, if Edu and his cohorts have a scheduled raid, more or less, the sellers have already been tipped off and are extremely vigilant during that particular day. You can see them talking about the impending raid, having boxes readied, and their supplies are not 100% displayed. Besides, if a raid ensues, the news spreads like wildfire and within a span of five minutes, all of the shops are closed. Should you encounter one such raid, then simply head to the nearest convenience store and take cover.  So, be sure to send a postcard on your next trip to Quiapo.

      Yesterday, I accompanied Dennis to the  National Museum  as a sidetrip in his ongoing vacation here in Manila. We rode the jeepney and went down at the old Congress building. We were surprised to see that the Museum was under renovation. The question is: for how long? We were informed that the exhibits are currently housed in the nearby Finance building. So, as intrepid tourists, we walked over to the new museum and we were surprised at the state of the National Museum, which should be the repository of our culture and heritage.  When you go there, please bring an ounce of sanity because the information desk is as daft as a lobotomized chicken. She smilingly informed us that there are no available brochures or maps as to how the exhibits go. She cannot elucidate if the Spoliarium is on exhibit. Don't the employees know what on earth they're displaying there. Any well-respected museum should have more foresight than that! If you go to the  Hong Kong Museum , you'll be all agog and be swept away in the depth of their exhibits.    urlLink    Look at all those plates!!&nbsp; urlLink     So, we headed first for the San Diego Exhibit. Wow! It was worthy of praise. The exhibit was well made with the ship's planks laid on the floor; the cannons and shots all meticulously arranged. The nice thing is, it was informative and interactive- meaning, research was very thorough and the ojects (cannons) can be touched.  And get this- there was no guard around.  Unfortunately, there were a handful of visitors to the museum. This is to show how we appreciate our cultural heritage: by not going to the museums.   Then there were lesser exhibits like the evolution of the Philippines, the exhibit of the Filipino people showcasing indiginous crafts and antiques from the Ivatans, to the Tausugs, from the Igorots to the Mangyans. There were swords, krisses, baskets, handlooms, dresses, cooking pots, utensils, head gears, etc. For school children, this was a perfect place to start immersing them into Philippine history & culture, but for the avid collector & art afficionado, the place is bereft of anything interesting (except for the San Diego wreck).  We were looking for Lunas, Amorsolos, Hidalgos and old Spanish gold and ivory. But due partly to the renovation, only the peripheral specimens were exhibited. I'm sure, though, that when the old Museum will be opened it will be a prime tourist attraction. But if they shall procastinate and delay the opening of the old one, then as far as I'm concerned, this will be the last time I will go (lest bring anyone) to this "replacement" museum.

       urlLink     MMM. The Pandora's box of goodies!   urlLink      urlLink     MMM... donuts. Seen here are the Peanut Butter frosts and Berry Full Stuffits   urlLink     MMM.... what can I say? These donuts from  Gonuts Donuts  are really really delicious. They are like  Krispy Kreme  of the Philippines. "Insanely delicious" is what the product blurb tells us. The dough is soft and moist- similar to those no-bake brownies. There is no lemony taste or the sickeningly sweet sensation in the dough. It's not that sweet. And this delight is carried by the yummy taste of the glaze or the filling. The filling is really really good. For example, I love their peanut butter donut where the frosting if reheated tastes like real soft delectable peanut butter. So far that's my favorite, though some of the flavors like the Chocohazelnut and the Berryfill really stands out.  The line in  Greenbelt3  is continuous and you can see all those donuts disappear before your eyes. I've heard that at the main branch at the Fort, you need to wait for 2 hours. The turnover is so fast that by the time you reach the counter to tell the cashier your orders, they sometimes will regretfully (but happily) inform you that your chosen flavor is already gone. It's ironic because it was only 10 minutes ago that you saw a whole tray of them.  And people cannot stop buying this stuff. It's as if the whole world turns on this donut alone. You can see families going to the movies, lovers strolling by, children waiting with boxes upon boxes of Gonuts Donuts. It's amazing to see hordes of people gorging and stuffing their faces with these donuts- and still keep a smile.  Is this just a fad? I don't think so. Compared to the price of a single donut from  Dunkin or Mister Donut , the difference is  a mere peso . It's very affordable, even if the product is coated in exclusivity. It's a status of good taste to have them. So rather waste your money on some mass-produced donut that you can't even finish a single one, sample and get addicted on Gonuts Donuts. I just can't help raving about this stuff. You'll never go wrong on this one!  ***oh yeah, I was paid by Gonuts for the article. Psyche!

      Actually, the SONA of President Arroyo was not the original speech she intended to deliver. It was a hastily written draft made by Dinky Soliman replacing my speech. Damn, that Dinky! She must have sensed that what I've written can capsize this administration. Capsize my foot! So, she crumpled and threw away my 11"x8" piece into the paper shredder, and with an evil glint in her eyes, she mocked, "Now, your nefarious plan, whatever it is, will never ever happen." The last thing I remembered was her elephant feet tramping away from the Office of the President.  This was the jist of my original SONA, since I didn't save any drafts:  1. To curb the unbridled  population rate , we shall adopt a 4 children policy in which a parent or parents can have a maximum of only 4 children regardless of custody. For which after the fourth child has been delivered, attending physicians are hereby authorized and deputized to  ligate  the mother's fallopian tubes so as to prevent unnecessary pregnancies in the future. This will be with consent signed by the husband and by the mother-in-law.   Should the couple have  more than four children  on or after the promulgation of this bill, the parents of the unfortunate spawn can have two options:    a.  put the child into  adoption     b.  the family can raise the child with a proviso for payment of an annual  Nuisance Child Tax  which amounts to 10 times the parents combined income taxes.    c.  the family who cannot comply with the Nuisance Child Tax for a maximum of three years, will force the child to commit  seppuku  with Dinky Soliman acting as a "second" and such ritual will be placed under the auspices of the DSWD.  2.  All  public utility vehicles  including but not exclusive to jeepneys, taxis, buses, FXs, calesas, Tricycles, Trisikads, etc., will be confiscated. Sixty percent of which will be nationalized and refranchised for public use while the rest will be disassembled and smelted into recycled steel by the National Steel Corporation.  3.  All  police officers and personnel  shall undergo 2-months physical and skills retraining at specified military installations in compliance with the 32-inch waist line memorandum. Certification from such retraining is obligatory for reentry into the police service. All police officers and personnel shall have a  tamper-proof portable electronic BlackBox  to record all apprehensions of law violators.  This device shall be turned over to an NBI representive who will electronically feed it into the NBI database for future reference.  4.  All  residents of Mindanao  with Muslim descent shall be  transmigrated to designated cities and municipalites all over the Philippines, with the provision of land parcels of equivalent land values of their former residences. Farms, buildings and other Mindanao-based assets shall be confiscated and recompensated by means of high-yielding government bonds of equivalent market value. Each city and town must not have a Muslim population more than 15% of its total population. This act shall be made under the authority of the AFP.   Non-compliance to the act shall be deemed subversive, therefore, subject to forfeiture of any civil liberty and protection of justice.  Liquidation shall be executed through the modus operandi of the newly deputized  Davao Death Squad .   Muslim Lands and assets  remaining in Mindanao shall be put up at a nation-wide public auction under the auspices of Christie's and Southeby's. Proceeds shall go to government agencies, specifically the DPWH, DOH, DSWD and DAR. Mosques shall be transformed into Christian churches pending auction by the Iglesia ni Christo, Mormons and by the Catholic Church.   5. There will be a creation of a body for the shift from presidential form of government to a federal type. A federal state is currently defined as a state comprising of not less than 3 provinces sharing enthnolinguistic similarities and can generate enough revenue for self-sustainment. Rules and regulations on this matter are still pending.  Current nominations for federal states are: a. State of Ilocandia (Region I + Batanes, Cagayan, Isabela, Kalinga-Apayao, Ifugao) b. State of Bicolandia (Region V + Northern Samar) c. Ilonggo Republic (Region 6 + Palawan, Romblon) d. Republic of Cebu (Region 7 & 8)

      In Thailand, there is an open market called  Chatuchak . It is famed all over SEAsia and probably all over the world in which tourists, young and old, rich and poor, go there to purchase cheap knock-offs and overuns and to rub shoulders among the natives. It must be one exhilarating experience to enter and be devoured into the cavernous maw where your senses are frequently assaulted with exotic sweaty smells, colorful sights, raucous noise and the temptation to dive into the fray and haggle with the merchants. There your budget is on the red and if your common sense does not reign in your impulse, then your wallet can go bye bye sooner than you think.  An experience in  Greenhills  is probably as near the one in Chatuchak. The only difference is the air conditioning. I observed there that the place was set-up according to the merchandise.  The  atrium  was filled with clothes of every kind- from sarongs to printed T-shirts, from pants to socks.  The place was so jampacked that you have to squeeze yourself right through the crowd. I even stepped on the foot of one of the saleslady- that's what she got for wearing open-toed sandals. The  mezzanine  meanwhile is filled racks upon racks of cellphones of every brand and color. This is compounded by Muslim urchins prodding you to buy bootlegged DVDs harking "DBD, boss? DBD?" In another corner, there were countless stalls of cheap jewelry- most of which looked like plastic beads anyway. Most of the sellers are Muslims. I don't know why that is so though. In Virra Mall side, the whole place is full of CDs, pirated software of any kind, computer parts, and collectibles which can bring anyone with the shopping bug into virtual orgasm. Everything your imagination desires is here.  The whole place looked like a big termite colony. You can see flow and counterflow, traffic sans altercations and bumper to bumper congestion. A claustrophobe nightmare. The funny thing is that there were a number of foreigners haggling over bags and jackets, trying on rip-off Nikes, rummaging through the clothes and rubbing elbows with the Filipinos. It's as if they turned our shopping playground into another secret tourist destination.  For adventurous "National Geographic" tourists and foreigners out for a bargain, then, this is the best place to be- all in one roof. Some even brought their children. Must be expats. Just imagine them being so sensitive to their travel advisories that they ignored it got enough spunk to go into Greenhills. To think there are Muslims in every stall and that there is a chance that a terrorist can blow up the place or hold them hostage. But like life in the fatalist Philippines, hell may come over  basta  we get to shop.  The government should take notice about this sight, so they can be encouraged to put up more shopping areas emulating Thailand's premier entrepreneurial paradise- Chatuchak. If not, I hope the private sectors like travel agencies hopefully shall put the shopping experience of Greenhills on their brochures. If not, then we shall remain in the belly of the beast.
