      yesterday i bought my sister's birthday prezzie... i can't wait to see the grin on her face as she opens it :D  ZAPP'S HOME!!!! *dances ab00t* he came home this morning, and apart from some very suspect fur-shaving (which makes him look curiously like a poodle) you'd hardly notice he'd had anything wrong with him. he is as cute, and lovely, and meowingly in-your-face as ever :)  i can't really be bothered to type much now. we are about to have a picnic dinner in t'garden. so mebbe i'll be back later...

      well, yesterday was fun. i was sorting through all my old cards and letters as part of a HUGE (and i mean huge - i threw out 4 full binbags of stuff) sort-out of my room which has hardly been changed since... a long time ago. my room was looking absolutely spiffy so i thought i'd make it that extra bit spiffy by sorting some more. and guess what? an unexpected windfall in the shape of a ten pound note - a christmas gift from my nanny which i'd evidently forgotten to take out of the card. so that was nice.  also  yesterday i was rummaging under my wardrobe and came across a dearly beloved t shirt that i thought i'd lost years ago. it was a tad dusty... fluffy, in fact, but a wash sorted that. not a lot else happened yesterday. i took the dog for a walk, and the park was really nice. usually it's full of gangs but because it was during school time there was no one there, so scamp could wander freely, as dogs are wont to do...  the vet says zapp may be able to come home this weekend. he got hit by a car last sunday night, came back to us on monday morning all bloody and muddy. rushed him off to the vet and he's been there since. he was incredibly lucky - nothing was broken, he wasn't injured badly at all, but for the fact that his entire chin had been scraped completely off his jaw and was dangling, so to speak. the vet said he'd never seen a cat so lucky. anyway, apparently he's doing well, and we may be able to have him back soon... can't wait.  my sister's birthday's on monday. she's 13, which is scary. i remember when i was 13, i was like "omg, i'm like, a teenager now". i'm going to get her a gamecube game that she really wants - metroid prime. i love spoiling my sister. nanny gave me £400 for my world challenge (more on that later) fund which enabled me to pay the final cheque and have a few hundred pounds left over, so i can afford to be generous :)  ok, world challenge. it's this thing, where about 20 of us from my school save up £3000 each to go to south africa for a month this summer. we'll be hiking, trekking, camping, canoeing, that kind of stuff, and also do a community project in a village somewhere in the middle of nowhere. the point is to 'empower' us, if you will, so we raised all the money ourselves and while we're there, although there will be adults with us, they're not allowed to make any decisions - we have to. i can't wait, i've been saving every penny for 2 years and now it's finally time. i'm going to be the leader on my 16th birthday *grins* also this summer... when my exams have finished me and six friends are going youth hostelling for a week in the lake district, no adults. to be honest, i'm looking forward to that more than south africa - i've been arguing a lot with my parents recently and any opportunity to be away from them, and with my friends, must be good.  wow, that was a long entry. maybe i'll go upstairs now and 'revise' (ha!) for my business studies exam at 1. or maybe i'll doodle. who knows...

      well well well. here we have... my blog. i didn't actually realise this site existed but for the people in my neopets guild, who all seem to have blogs... so, like a sheep, i'm getting one too :D today has been rather nice, actually, even though i had my german listening gcse exam this morning. it was  so  easy; way easier than anything we'd done in class. which was a relief, naturally. so i'm back at home now, meant to be revising for my case study business studies exam tomorrow, but of course i'm not - i'm on neopets, as ever. hey-ho.  the weather's suddenly turned rather manky. i hope it doesn't rain, as i will probably be sent to walk the dawg later on. tea and bakewells are nice.  how's that for a first post? really... landmarky, and all that crap.

      had the school leavers' service yesterday. our school's meant to be church of england, so we have cathedral services every now and then where all the teachers go on about god (who i personally don't believe in, but then that is another blog) and we sit in stupified silence. yesterday we said goodbye to about 20 members of our year (most o' the dropouts, unsurprisingly) and year 13. it wasn't really sad - none of my friends are leaving.  today, went to choir in the morning. i really like choir, singing's one of the things i'm really good at. i'm an alto, and there's only about 5 of us, so you have to sing really bigly (shuddupiknowit'snotaword) and it's good :)  came to tom's afterwards... drank tea... got him in trouble... watched men in black 2 and mooched. i am, in fact, still here now. a boring sunday awaits... i may consider working on this help site thingy for neopets.  i really like neopets, kinda sad i know, and yet... it's rather addictive. i'm going to make a site not just to join all the other websites out there which offer information on everything and anything neopets, but one to introduce each subject and provide links to all the good help sites i can find, as well as just advice and not "answers". i hope it'll help - i know the fact it will be grammatically correct must be a bonus (and yes, i   will  be using capital letters - normally i have a deep pathological aversion to them...)  toodlepip for now, folks.

      had my physics exam this morning. actually, it went well, which was  obviously  all down to the revision i did with tom yesterday ("so, Q=IT. a bit like... quit! you can't  quit  revision". "yes tom")  actually, it was rather useful. only thing i was worried about was this one equation question, where my result was that radio waves travel at 300,000 km/s. but according to my dad that is possible, so i may breathe easy again. i was really worried about this exam, cos i had to get a good mark on it to make up for my dire chemistry and scrape the A* that i'm meant to get.  yellis stinks. i was predicted: one A, two A/A*s, and seven A*s. nothing like expectations to make you nervous. ... i'll be great.  this now means, however, that i have  only one exam left !!! (oops. forgot, there, that "the value of a statement is inversely proportional to the number of exclamation marks following it.) all i have left is history (sourcework, which i could by now do in my sleep... how tedious) and like, it's all over. it's so weird. for two years i've been telling myself that when it got to the exams, i'd work really hard, and now i find myself wondering where the hell they all went. this always happens at the end of the year. my time at school has shot by since year seven. i love my school *smiles* (although the maroon blazers  are  a slight drawback).  also today... sweep had to go to the vets :( sweep's our "thousand pound cat". he isn't really, but he's getting there. i will tell you of his woes...  a year or so back, sweep came home all bloody-nosed and miserable. he wasn't cleaning himself, was messing himself, and wouldn't eat. we took him to the vet, who said it was a kidney thing and gave him medication for that. he was on this medication for about a week, and stayed at the vet's for a few days. meanwhile, his tail hung limp, and he never moved it, but we just thought it was hurt. then he got an abscess at the base of his spine. he was rushed back in, where the vet noticed he had a broken tail, which had to be amputated.  since then, he's had multiple problems because of the accident (which we're sure was caused by a car - stupid uncaring drivers) such as bladder problems, kidney problems... you name it.  anyway. he's fine now, although he does get odd looks from people who've never seen him because of his lack of tail. he's been limping a lot recently, though, so we took him to the vet's again and he's on painkillers. aah, family history.  he's not allowed out now though, and so he's sat at the back door all day yowling to be let out. he's part siamese and i think you can tell in his pitiful cries: siamese cats are said to cry like babies

      got back not too long ago from a "camping" trip. twas one of my friend's mother's 40th birthday party, and afterwards me and 8 friends slept in a tent in some field somewhere (i think the place was called wadenhoe - like that's useful). it was fun. i was kinda uncomfortable at first, i always am at such things. the music was ear-splittingly loud and i was preparing myself for an evening of sitting and moping while other people made fools of themselves trying to dance while holding bottles of beer. alas, it was not to be, and i found myself enjoying it.  sacre bleu!  anyway. buffet was good... tent was good... rawr.   it's great fun, sleeping in a tent :D i got up to go outside this morning, at about 4 or 5 and just ran around in the field for a moment. everyone should run around at top speed in their pyjamas every now and again; it's good for the soul. i felt very free :) unfortunately, this wonderful feeling was ruined by the realisation that i had stung the soles of my feet on nettles. but it wasn't so bad.  got a lift home this morning. parents had saved me some of last night's dinner, which i had warmed up, and some strawberries and cream. parents are nice sometimes.  i'm now going to have a cup of tea (i haven't had any since  yesterday  *dies*) and probably return to contemplate various pointless and stupifyingly dull issues ensconced in the safety of this wonderful chair... *pauses to swivel a bit*... while my parents are out buying a lawn mower. hum

      *yawns* well, this morning was interesting. i was woken up at half 3 by the dulcet tones of someone banging on our door, repeatedly ringing our doorbell and yelling "hello?" through our letterbox. we weren't going to answer it, thinking it was some idiot playing a prank, but my sister said it looked like a policeman wearing one of those glow-in-the-dark things, so i went down and opened it.  turned out, our car was in the middle of the road. literally. it was about 10 metres from where it had been parked, smack bang in the middle of the street. no damage, nothing. we thought the handbrake must have been off, but it wasn't. the alarm didn't go off because there was no one inside the car, and how on earth they steered it from out of its parking place without using the steering wheel is beyond me.  i hate to admit it, but i thought it was a pretty cool prank :P anyway, i didn't sleep much after that, because two hours later, as i was finally dropping off again, my cats decided to start running around my room. they weren't even fighting, just running. twas bizarre. i shooed them out and stomped back to bed, but i only got maybe two hours more sleep.  watched the football last night. i enjoy watching football, actually, when it's good. good ol' croatia put up a fight to france (who'd been predicted an easy win) and they drew. i like cheering for the underdog, specially when they do good. that italian git, totti or something, got only a 3-match ban for spitting in a denmark player's face, which means he could be back for the semi-final. that's not right; he shoulda been banned from the tournament.  i'd best be off, mum wants the puter. she's writing an essay for her masters degree in sociology of education. sounds rather interesting, actually :)

      you know something else that really annoys me? i'm really warming to this grumpiness thing now... "reality" tv shows. you may have noticed (or you may have not, but for the purposes of this i will ignore that) that big brother is in the news. apparently (don't worry, i don't watch it. wouldn't touch it with a 20-metre indestructible bargepole) the producers "evicted" two people, put them in  another  house for two days, then brought them back, supplied lots of alcohol, and revealed it was a fake eviction. there was a massive fight, security guards were called in and the show's ratings will as of now be higher than ever. it makes me sick. it's all these so-called "social experiments" which are the most ridiculous things on tv at the moment (and for the last couple of years). they're like, car crash tv. you don't want to look, but it's oh-so-tempting to.  i don't have sky, but when i see it at friends' houses i often see adverts for this show where two people are supposed to have applied to get married, randomly. the bride believes they both entered into the show from the public. the catch is the groom is an actor, and he's been briefed to be as unattractive (and judging from the adverts, he is), obnoxious, rude and destructive as he can be. the bride has to introduce him to her parents, arrange the wedding, you name it. understandably, she is distraught. this is what really gets me... the catchline is, in a gleeful-sounding american accent, "the whole show's a joke. and  the joke's on her ". cue shot of bride crying.  i despair of the world.

      now i've taken the quick tour through global politics, sneaked a quick peek at environmental issues, but i didn't even start on today's consumer, capitalist (*hemhem* i have this thing about capitalism) society. the rise of big corporations (i'm thinking microsoft and the like) has led to a possession-based mindset which further boosts those big companies and drowns out small competition. the rise of monopolies means the gap between wealthy western countries and developing countries is widening, and it is becoming harder for those struggling countries to compete. the elimination of world debt would help this... but of course, that is something that is never going to happen.  the amount of money going around in the business markets in developed countries has increased at a rate which is not in proportion to the increase in wealth for the rest of the population. i'm thinking football transfers here. when you think the good players are earning several thousand pounds  every week , it's quite obscene.  i'm dipping quite a lot into my business studies lessons here... market economies like america's serve to benefit the rich and make few allowances for less well-off people. there is no national health service (we may complain a lot about ours, but we're lucky at least to have it) meaning that every single person has to take out expensive and complicated insurance policies. you have to pay (speaking from my mother's experience here; i was born in america) to have a baby in hospital.   ok, i'm done again. be prepared for more complaining about the state of the world later...

      i'm at a friend's house now, waiting for him to come back from his french exam (which i don't have to do, bwa ha ha) and i thought i'd let you all know (as you evidently  need  to know) my views on the world we live in. *clears throat pompously*  i worry a lot about the world, actually. when i was little it seemed that everything was right, that people would always be happy and live safely and life would continue on at a plodding pace for all eternity. now i'm older, and more intelligent, i worry a lot more. i'm part of this scheme called the "academy for gifted and talented students" (sounds like something out of 1984) which is basically a group of sane people. you get letters every now and again advising you about workshops and suchlike. i went to one a while ago, about global politics. it was completely fascinating, but it made me question things a lot more (incidentally, i am now rather interested in politics, but that is a moot point). everywhere you look (no, not literally) things are going wrong.   take the middle east. from what america says, you might be forgiven for thinking it was a hotbed of terrorism. instead you have such situations as israel and palestine, in which the tragedy is that they both have a fair claim to the land. the jews had been persecuted for centuries and deserved a safe place of their own. however, the palestinians had lived there for centuries and deserved to keep their land. instead of diplomacy, however, it has turned into a war of attrition, which each side killing a few more "enemies" each time. on one side, the palestinians, little more than refugees in their own country, forced by desperate times to show their anger and frustration in the only way possible - bombs and violence. on the other side, israel, led by the corrupt (he  so  took those bribes) and obstinate ariel sharon, backed and financed by the most powerful country in the world, the usa (you may have guessed my sympathies lie with the palestinians). what the israelis are doing now, by building their wall, is simply shutting the palestinians into an enclosure, like animals. neither side is prepared to stop the killing. as long as israel has the support of other countries, it will not need to seek a diplomatic solution.  then there is korea. north korea is a country led by a dangerous (and possibly slighty insane) dictator. not much is known about him as foreigners and journalists are notallowed in. the people inside are not allowed out. it is unclear whether he has nuclear armaments or not, therefore the world ignores him (not without justification), not wanting to provoke him.  in zimbabwe, which hasn't appeared in the news for a long time, a man little more than a dictator is starving his people, committing human rights atrocities and yet still being invited to global summits. the millions of pounds and dollars in aid being poured into the country is not going to the people who need it, but filtering into the coffers of the government.  all over the world, when a bomb is dropped, or someone is shot, you  are nearly guaranteed to hear dark whisperings of al-quaida, or terrorism. funny how osama bin laden has dropped off the world stage, to be replaced by the figure of saddam hussein. what characterises all this more than anything, though, is the rise of america. for perhaps the first time, a country has taken upon itself (ostensibly) to rid the world of all its evils. not poverty, injustice, or debt, but armaments and terror. america's own record on such things is not squeaky clean. it is a country which held people at guantanamo bay indefinitely, without charge or legal aid, a position which is illegal, againt the geneva convention, and morally wrong. it is a country whose president's own democratic election was disputed, and whom has become an internationally ridiculed (and hated) figure, especially in many of those arab states who may have america's "liberation" forced upon them i an effort to drive away the undoubted horror that was september 11th.  meanwhile, in britain, the prime minister has become a joke, and bigoted and racist parties are earning more seats than ever. i find the rise of ukip and the bnp deeply, deeply disturbing. i cannot understand how people could be so ignorant and ill-informed as to believe that withdrawing our country from european affair will in any way help our position. i find the views of those people (the ones who have a seemingly automatic loathing of asylum seekers) rather shocking, given the supposedly open and free society we live in today. i think i will vote liberal. i think tony blair made a grave mistake when he decided to go to war, although to be fair i do think saddam hussein needed to be removed from power. by going against the feeling of the british people (and ignoring the largest protest against war britain has ever seen) he made his position as representative of the british people untenable. i do feel sorry for him, as i feel he is in a sense caught between a rock and a hard place. he cannot afford to lose the favour of the usa, as with its transformation into moral guardian of the world it could be a very useful ally.   oh, and i've forgotten about the environmental impact on our physical surroundings of all this activity. the polar ice caps are melting at a faster rate than they ever have, america, possibly the world's greatest producer of carbon dioxide emissions has refused to sign the kyoto treaty, oil production is being increased to lower prices (so we can all fulfil our petrol-fuelled lifestyles) and fossil fuels are running out at a dangerous rate. global warming is becoming a bigger threat than ever.  as i said, the world's an interesting place nowadays. apologies for the rant :)

      ah, i'm back. i haven't posted because i didn't feel like it... and then i couldn't be bothered... i'm like this with diaries too. i've been on deviantART way too much lately. i watch all these people so whenever i come online i've got like 50 messages waiting for me... bah.  exams are going well. i have four left, two history and two business studies. my revision's been pretty much non-existent, but i manage just fine anyway, being a genius and all 0_o we had maths calculator paper, and a history paper today. history rocked, i knew all the answers, but writing solid for two hours destroyed my knuckles... ah well. shoulda earned me my predicted a*. i hope.  life's been good. room's still tidy, zapp is back to his frog-murdering self, i handed in my note which means i'll be able to start drumming lessons next year (can't wait!!) and i've finally found what i want to do at uni. i've been umming and aahing for a while. for a bit i thought i'd like to do german, cos i really enjoy it and i'm good at it, but the same goes for economics (well, to be fair, i don't do it yet, but i can almost guarantee i'm going to find it fascinating). i was looking through the oxford prospectus, having already checked cambridge's, and i saw this course: ppe. philosophy, politics and economics. wouldn't that be fascinating? well, i think so. i really  really  want to do that. gotta get into oxford though. they ask for aaa or aab, which i should be able to manage, i hope (lol, at my last parents' evening, my english teacher said i should go to oxbridge. i smiled and nodded, then afterwards, i go to my dad, "where's oxbridge??")  anyway. i'll be off. perhaps i'll post again in a few more months :)
