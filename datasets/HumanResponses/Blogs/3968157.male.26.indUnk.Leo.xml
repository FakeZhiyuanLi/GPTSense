      Yes, I have got the comments that you had sent to the editor. I think, you have made the same mistake that most people do. Here is what I intended,  Dear Reader, I am glad to have your comments. I truely understand that the topic has quite a few dimensions to deal with. Let me briefly illustrate that for your convenience and understanding.   1) Ethics and Islam:  Ethics are the universally defined principles.These principles have nothing to do with any religion. Islam, of course, "supports" all the ethical beliefs of a civilized society. My intention was not to criticize any religion including Islam. What I said was, that the concept of ethics is most likely mis-understood in Islam. In other words, it has been mis-understood by the Muslims. As I have already mentioned that deciet, murder, slavery e.t.c. are equally considered as un-acceptable acts in all societies and religions for that matter. This is the "base" of every relgion and there should not be any kind of compromise on that. All other issues that have been mentioned in the Holy Quran should be open to debate.For instance,  Allah, encourages Muslims to forgive Jews and Christians if they have committed injustices against us (Al Quran 2:109, 3:159, 5:85).  Supposing, I say I like it. One may have some different opinion by considering, for example, some different Sura (Do not make Jews and Christian your friends-AL-Quran). You know what, my answer to those people would be, to come on, let's discuss about that. Because, these concepts of "forgiveness" and "do not make some one your friend" have theological basis.   2)Intellectuals and Scholars:  I wish, we had some intellectuals, although we have a few, but not many who can openly debate on these issues.Let me tell you some thing about scholars.First of all,there is big difference between Intellectuals and Scholars. In order to understand the difference between the two, one has to understand the difference between the knowledge that has been "understood", and the knowlege that has been just "learned". One may be a scholar, but this does not render him or her an intellectual.Allama Talib johari is a great scholar of Islam, but he is certainly not an intellectual.If he was an intellectual, he would not have just taken out the facts, in order to make his point and snap a judgment on people, who does not hold his beliefs or share for that matter. For your kind information, I do not feel it incumbent to tell you that I belong to the Shiite-Sect. of Islam, and so does Mr. Talib Johari.But I do not consider him an intellectual. The great intellectual of Islam-- an Iranian--Ali Shariati was assasinated because he challenged the different aspects of Islam that muslims(Ayatullas) had, in his view, mis-understood. I consider it necessary to tell you, my brother in Islam, that he had never criticized the religion.His criticism was towards those scholars(Ayatullas) who had mis-interpreted the different aspects of Islam.  Wish you all the best, Mohammd Asim Raza  Once again thanx for the comments.

       -----Original Message-----From: Ejaz Ahmad [mailto:ejazca@hotmail.com]Sent: Friday, July 30, 2004 3:53 PMTo: editor@pakistanweekly.comSubject: Comments on Islam Ultimate Mystery  It was felt really very exciting by reading the title.Mr.Asim had started the topic with a very interesting manner that could make one to read the full article,but what he really wanted to say to people I really could not understand.Whether he had identified some thing different from Islamic true beliefs than what generally followed by most of the muslims. At some stage it was felt we are going to learn some thing really very interesting point which had totally missed in our entire life (So far) & which would really help us in extending our vision beyond the generally surrounding line of belief of Islam.But by going through the whole article I feel that writer is rather having more belief on those scholars who either were totally relating to some other religion &amp; which definitely makes him bias in offering opinion about the other religion so that he could "Justify"his belief & the acts of those people whom with he relate. At one point he is right in saying that we put the blame on others istead of identifying the true problem.So if this is the case then its an act of every human being not solely relate to Islamic world or any sector of muslim community. He says that "greatest mistake made by scholars was not that they were unable to learn about Islam but rather they were unable to understand it well." I am seriouslly surprise to read these above noted lines.What scholars he is talking about I refuse to understand.If he is saying any scholar of the present time who is favoring the acts, eg suisidal attacks, then I agree with him but if he is talking about the real scholar of Islam who did not only proved by act but by writing so many books that they have contributed alot in the civilisation of the world, which was at that time when Islam came into being was totally in totally uncivilised &amp; the rule of might is right was prevailing.So it has started again. Those scholars really contributed alot that made ancestors of present western countries to think logically & by using their research they progressed alot to reach at this point of power. To make my point short I would say that writer had picked an exciting topic but was seem to be confuse for his religious belief.In Islam ,fortunately, every religious belief supports all ethical acts of a civilized society. If we see in detail, I would say that "Sin" in islam, eg drinking wine, could be acceptable in another society but if one sees that if no body does it due to taking it wrong as per his religious belief there will not be any problem due a drunk person which is normally witnessed in other societies where it is acceptable but even there if somebody is away from it is considered having good morale.Mere by extending the same example ,by taking it as sin & not practicing it would keep a person always at the normal state of mind &amp; would not act insanly.  I request to writer to keep on writing articles but whenever he starts a topic then it should be well addressed because there are lot of people in the world, now due to internet communication, who can perceive some thing different about a particular religion by making base the thoughts of some one wrote in a famous magazines.

         Introduction  :  "Spinning more plates doesn't increase your talent, it increases your likelihood of dropping a plate(Kerry Walls)".   Says --"John C. Maxwell" ----New york Times best selling author of the 21' Irrefutable Laws OF Leadership' ," So the question is not whether you can do every thing by yourself; it's how soon you are going to realize that you can't".     &nbsp;  WoW! Fair enough ! isn't it ?   Dear Friends,  Before&nbsp;I actually start 'elaborating' the ' Concept Of Team Dynamics .I would like to ask for&nbsp;your permission to go back in to the history , back to 1963. So that ,&nbsp;I can substantiate my arugument in defining the 'role of a leader ' in building a team or nation for that matter.   In 'April --1963', one of most appealing revolutionary leader ---' The King' ----Yes, "Matin Luther King" , wrote a letter , in order to address his critics,in both races, who felt that he either had not suffered enough for his law-breaking or was moving too fast in his efforts to overthrow 'America's segregated society. ( The Age Of Anxiety And Beyond) .  He writes, " An injustice anywhere ,is a threat to justice every where".   He writes further,  "But as&nbsp;I continued to think about the matter , I gradually gained a bit of satisfaction from being considered an extremist.Was not Jesus an extremist in love ---love your enemies,bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.Was not Amos an extremist for justice---let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.Was not Paul an extremist for the gospel of Jesus Christ---I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.Was not Matin Luther King an extremist ----I can do none other so held me God".And finally he writes, "So the question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind of extremist will we be."   These are his words .That shows his 'vission'.And that also made him the the leader --in the eyes --- of his followers and for that matter his team.History witnesses it that 'the team is nothing with out its leader' .Come what may , we can not separate them.       The Concept Of Team Dynamics&nbsp;   &nbsp;Once well said by Mother Teresa," You can do what I can not do.I can do what you can not do.Together we can do great things".  Well, the concept of 'Team Dynamics' lies in the concept of 'achieving the goal' ,in the concept of 'what we can not do alone' and in the concept of 'leadership', as i've already mentioned earlier , in this presentation.    The Concept Of Achieving The Goal   As to what is the 'Concept Of Achieving The Goal' ---depends on the fact , that what are our desires ? What do we want to attain ?And if we have our goals set , will we be able to achieve that by our own. If not ,then , how can we ?   These are some issues that give birth to the over all concept&nbsp; of Team Dynamics.  Further more, if we want to achieve some thing with the help of others, then we 're gonna have to play by the 'rules of the game'. Now the question is,"What are the rules of the game"?&nbsp;My answer would be , it's an understanding of the fact that , "team is a collection of individuals seeking a common goal . A common objective". In order to&nbsp;determine as to what --- a common goal ----- is ? We need to have a 'vision' first . That how clearly we see where we want to be.    The Concept Of What We Can't Do Alone   If we look at the giant companies of the world.And ask ourseves that how did they attain that caliber? We may be able to find the answer in the ' real forces behind them'.  Let me quote John C Maxwel once again, so that we may be able to understand it better.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Individuals play the game ,but teams win championships".   It takes a whole lot to get the goal accomplished .And one individual can not do it alone .And that's what 'Team Dynamics' is all about.   Look at the great personalities of the world.Look at 'Winston Churchill' , 'Albert Einstein'---- a scientist whose theory of relativity is still considered as a 'land mark' in the field of "applied physics".Why go too far ?Look at the 'empire of Martha Stewart'.Look at "John Kerry"---his campaign in the primary elections. Let me come close to you guys.Look at the " University Of Phoenix".Can that be run by one - person.The answer would be ---'absolutely not' .It's the team effort that can convert the junk - companies in to the giant companies.Look around .Look at 'CNN ' ,'MCI'. It's all about 'team --work' and 'team - orientation'.        The Concept Of Leadership , In Team Dynamics   I have already summed it up in the begining of this presentation .But let me quote 'Winston Churchill", During the World War II , among many of the 'set backs' that Britain had ,the one was of great importance.Its people didn't work in the coal mines .They would think of it as a dirty job. Churchill was well aware of that . He told the people that what would be done and&nbsp;how would the people---who fought ---the war, be honored .   He said,  "First would come the sailors of the navy ,he said , the people who continued the Trafalgar and defeat of the Spanish Armada.Next would come the best and brightest of Britain, the pilots of the Royal Airforce who fended off the German Luftwaffe.Following them would be the soildiers who had fought at Dunkirk.Then last of all would come the coal-dust-covered men in miners' caps.And Churchill indicated that someone from the crowd might say, " And where were you during the crucial days of the struggle?"And the voices of ten thousand men would respond , "We were deep in the earth with our faces to the coal."It's said that tears appeared in the eyes of those hardened men. And they returned to their inglorious work with steely resolve,having been reminded of the role they were playing in their country's noble goal of preserving freedom for the Western world (Laws Of Teamwork)".   That's what it takes to form a team. It's the whole team that makes the impossible ,possible.But it's leader's vision that provide the team with dynamics,dimension and direction.Infact, he is the one who keeps them on track.And who set the tone for a great success.    Conclusion &nbsp;  In the end&nbsp;I would like to remind my dear friends that Team Dynamics is nothing but to know the ways, in which we can achieve even the most difficult tasks as a team in an effective manner.  "You must have a long-range vision to keep you from being frustrated by short -range failures (Charles Noble)".   Mohammad Asim Raza

      U.S. shouldn’t interfere in nations’ internal affairs--Originally published in Peoria Journal Star.&nbsp;  November 10, 2002   Most of America’s problems are the results of its own foreign policies, interfering in other nations’ internal issues in order to get power and influence.   Most Americans don’t know about their country’s irrational policies towards different nations. They are unaware how the media manipulates their lives. They have been raised to believe everything they watch on TV.   In the Soviet Union’s war with Afghanistan, the United States not only supported the Afghanis but also trained and funded them. After the war and the split of the old Soviet Union, the United States forgot about the Afghanis. As a result, they felt enmity toward the United States. The same thing happened in 1980 in the Iran-Iraq War. The United States should review its foreign policies toward different nations if it really wants peace in the world.   Americans never see the aftermath of war. Whenever the United States attacks another country, it does not attack from its own country. It has troops stationed in different regions of the world. Now the situation is getting worse. The war on terrorism is still not finished. In Afghanistan, the United States is ruling under its puppet leader, Hamid Karzai, who does not trust his own people. U.S. forces serve as his bodyguards.   Meanwhile, al-Qaida is reuniting under the new leadership, which may be more dangerous than ever before. There is no doubt in my mind that they will try to attack America again, especially when the United States is trying to resolve the Iraq and North Korea issues.   It’s time for the United States to listen to what different nations are talking about. Linking everything to terrorism does not hold water. The United States should be more realistic and clear about what it is doing. This is the only way the United States can reacquire its lost image.   Mohammad Asim Raza

        My Answer to Lincoln Journal Star, published on Tuesday, July 16, 2002.        &nbsp;   Well , I'm totally disagreed with the decision of the U.S. District Court. Lindh has been pleaded guilty to following&nbsp;charges :     &nbsp;   1)He aided Taleban and Al-Qaida terrorist network ,and    2)Carried explosive devices.     &nbsp;   In the two aforementioned charges, he has been given a 20-years sentence . The part that surprised me the most&nbsp;in the whole decision making process was, "How could the Attoneys just appear to have reached an agreement with the prosecution that he will not be tried for the charge that he had against him for killing the American Citizens?" Well,&nbsp;I think, their should be a free and fair trial system and justise should permeates the judge decision .It should not be influenced by any other authority .Because this is not the mediocre case.The whole world has an eye on that especially when the British born terrorist Sheikh Omar Saeed has been convicted and sentenced to death in an anti -terrorism court in Pakistan .     &nbsp;   Mohammad Asim Raza

       The concept of Ethics is most likely miss-understood in Islam than any other religion in the World, if not completely, to a greater extent. If Muslims had Islamic intellectuals rather than religious scholars, the fate of Islam would not have been at stake. The greatest mistake made by those scholars was not that they were unable to learn about Islam but rather they were unable to understand it well. Instead of studying the religion as an Islamic Ideology, focus of their theological basis has been on learning it, as an Islamic Science.  &nbsp;  In the Gulag Archipelago (1918-1956), Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russian author and historian, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970, wrote that “If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from rest of us and destroy them. But the line, dividing good and evil, cuts through the heart of every human being.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Leaving the discussion and insight into as to what is the difference between understanding the religion as an Ideology and learning it as a Science, for the future, I would like to give some reasoning that can not only substantiate my point of arguing the basis of ethical reasoning, but also, its relationship with the religion at the same time in general.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  In order to live an ethical life, one needs to understand the developmental process in acquiring the basis for the ethical reasoning. Unfortunately, most people confuse ethics with either social conventions or religious beliefs. In doing so, they usually forget that the ethical concepts are universally defined principles. These principles are equally applicable and accepted in all societies. Meaning, these concepts are not only trans-cultural but also trans-religious. More importantly, the basis of ethical reasoning is to develop a sense that can separate a right from a wrong. Whether a particular act a person engage in his or her personal life is harmful to the person he or she is engaged with or beneficial. Deceit, murder, slavery and threat are not only the mere words, but rather the detailed concepts that are identified and recognized in all societies, as un-acceptable acts. One needs not seek the conclusion in the socio-cultural convention or religion for that matter. After all, life is all about respecting other people and recognizing their rights.&nbsp;Furthermore, self-justification and self-deception has also been critical in determining the ethical reasoning. We as a human being have a strong tendency to either justify or disregard the opinions of our opponents. Instead of getting to the bottom of the problem, we usually put the blame on others. Thus, justifying ourselves and disregarding others by ignoring to see the things as they really are.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Theological beliefs, on the other hand, are the beliefs that are handed down from generation to generation and are virtually subject to debate. For instance, sin is a theological concept (theologically defined) not the ethical one. Things that look weird in one society may look totally fine and acceptable in another society. One should be very careful while blending the ethics into&nbsp;&nbsp; religious beliefs. Most of these religious concepts and beliefs are neither ethical nor un-ethical. For instance, the Encyclopedia Americana lists more than 300 religious belief systems including Atheism. These are what have been documented so far. One would not be surprised if the numbers go even higher. The question that can come across one’s mind is legitimate that how would the world react, if the universally defined concepts that are domain on itself, is confused with the theologically defined beliefs in order to solve a problem or justify a logic for that matter?&nbsp;Second, how can we relate the form of so-called modern terrorism to the concepts that have already been defined as un-ethical?&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Shmuel Bar, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Policy and Strategy at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel and a veteran of the Israeli intelligence community,&nbsp;  writes in his recent research paper that has been published by Policy Review, that, “While terrorism, even in the form of suicide attacks — is not an Islamic phenomenon by definition, it cannot be ignored that the lion’s share of terrorist acts and the most devastating of them in recent years have been perpetrated in the name of Islam”. In his footnotes to his main research, he concludes that, “It should be noted that in the historic paradigms of “suicide” terror, which are used as authority for justification of such attacks, the martyr did not kill himself but rather placed himself in a situation in which he would most likely be killed. Technically, therefore, he did not violate the Koranic prohibition on a Muslim taking his own life. The targets of the suicide terrorist of ancient times were also quite different — officials of the ruling class and armed (Muslim) enemies. The modern paradigm of suicide bombing called for renewed consideration of this aspect”.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Professor Akbar Ahmed, the Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies and professor of International Relations at American University in Washington, D.C. writes, in one of his columns “Islam and War---The real story”, that, “At that time and place, when armies fought, battles often began with a duel of champions. Quite commonly, if a champion defeated his opponent, that opponent’s army might just give up — and leave. Ali was a scholar, and also a renowned warrior, extraordinarily brave. One time, Ali was fighting the champion of the opposing army. He pushed his opponent on the ground, jumped on his chest — and lifted his sword to finish the opponent. At that point — with both armies watching in great suspense — the opponent, lying on the ground with Ali on his chest, spat on Ali’s face. The Muslim army got very tense when this occurred. Remember, it was a tribal society dominated by notions of revenge and honor. So when the victor got up, everybody expected him to be even more vicious and brutal to the defeated. But the army saw an amazing sight. Ali stood up and suddenly walked away. The generals gathered around and asked him, “Why did you just walk away? If you knocked down your opponent, why didn’t you finish him?” Ali replied, “That man was not my personal enemy. I was fighting in the name of God. But when he spat on me, he angered me and he became my personal enemy. If I had killed him then, I would have killed him in anger, not for the sake of God.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  How balanced these aforementioned scholars are in their assessments is a matter of fact.&nbsp; But the interesting part of their assessment is that they both came to the almost same conclusion.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Shmuel argues that the Sufi (Mystical) schools also have a tradition of syncretism, reformism and moderation. But these traditions have always suffered from the lack of, what he calls, wide legitimacy due to their non-Arab origin. Mr. Akbar, on the other hand believes that, “civilizations have to be much more sympathetic, much more understanding and much more appreciative of other cultures. Otherwise, the globalization process acts like a steamroller on honor and dignity. It just comes and just crushes you and your local community’s identity — and leaves nothing behind”.&nbsp;     I sometimes wonder, if two beliefs with totally different logic in both form and substance are put forward parallel to each other in one religion to deal a particular issue, then one has to be wrong. And if one is proved wrong, it has to be rejected in its entirety. I wish we had some more Islamic Intellectuals, like Professor Akbar, who could solve that mystery not on the basis of theological beliefs but in adherence to the sound ethical reasoning.

        Moving Pakistan on the path to Democracy                                                                       Once used to be the part of great Indus Valley Civilization almost 5000 years ago, India and Pakistan, finally divided into separate entities in 1947. The establishment of the new states was drawn along its religious lines.  Following Independence, the Congress Party ruled India for nearly 45 years; with the exception of   two brief periods in the 1970’s and 1980’s, thus, set the stage for a Democratic process after having promulgated its constitution on January 26th, 1950.  Pakistan, on the other hand, got stuck in a quandary and found itself in an awkward predicament between its Generals and Political elites. The Generals, once known to be the followers of the “Sandhurst”- tradition (a military culture modeled on the British Royal Academy at Sandhurst, England), found themselves capable enough in defining the fate of the country. They set their own standards of faith, loyalty, realism and philosophy. In other words, these so-called mentors made it difficult for Pakistan, to become a firm democratic country with limitation of powers and system of checks and balances.  Instead of letting the Civil-Democratic Governments run the country and build Pakistan up into a strong nation, these ambitious Generals seemed to have started off playing with the political process, right of the bed by maneuvering and manipulating the newly formed nation. The two coup attempts by Army, often, referred to as the “Rawalpindi Conspiracy” in 1951, lead to the imposition of Martial Law in 1953.  The situation, however, seemed to improve after the restoration of civil government and Pakistan was able to have its new constitution in 1956. But, with in a year the establishment not only over threw the civil government, but also, forced President Iskander Mirza to suspend the constitution and postpone the elections, which were supposed to be held in January, 1959. The first newly promulgated constitution of the un-fortunate country, thus, came to end on the Oct.7th, 1958.   After having sent the President, into exile in Britain, Field Marshal Ayub Khan assumed power and became the first direct military dictator who had set the trend of adventurisms for the Pakistani Military, which, infact has had been repeated by the Generals quite a few times in the history of Pakistan.    For almost eight years, Ayub Khan not only tightly controlled the civil societies of the country, but also, the armed forces of Pakistan. Infact, he was the one who led the country into the war in 1965, when India alleged Pakistan for aiding and instigating the armed groups to infiltrate the Kashmir and attack Indian forces. His mistake of going into the war without taking into consideration the opinions of the people and political elites led Pakistan once again at the verge of collapse not only economically and financially, but also, socially and politically.  In 1969, with the increase in massive agitations and movements against his rule, he was compelled to step down. He was replaced by his successor General Yahya Khan—the new dictator.  Yahya’s inability to understand the mood of his fellow citizens in East Pakistan, who were disquieted and believed that they had been colonized once again and this time by the West, resulted in the debacle of East Pakistan. The fact that the military, political and economic control was rested with the West Pakistan, the people of East Pakistan felt perturbed.  But the final blow to the Two-Nation theory that brought it down to its knees, came not from the proxy war waged by India (as conventional history has it), but infact, by a simple proof that the regime of Yahya Khan lacked the conventional wisdom, which is considered to be the greatest asset of the political parties.   Instead of trying to work on his regime’s damaged credibility, his establishment drove the founders of AIML (All India Muslim League) into demanding separation; first by arresting the founder of Awami League, Sheikh Mujibir Rahman, who was widely known as Mujib, under the pretext of, what they call, his suspicious political activities, and second by launching a crack down that resulted in the flee of millions of Bengalis into neighboring India, thus, created a humanitarian crises.  General did not pay any heed to the then prime minister of India Ms. Indra Gandhi, who made several requests to the General, persuading him to try to resolve the issues politically. But the tension between the rival countries mounted once again with the increase of refugee’s flow into India, which brought them to the war in December, 1971. With in 10-days, Indian Army not only captured Dhaka, but also, made the Pakistani Army to surrender.  Generals’ lack of abilities to resolve the issues politically with greater insight left Pakistan in a quagmire of instability for days to come. But the establishment never accepted its blunder mistakes that have stripped Pakistan of the dream sought by its leader and founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah.  Yahya Khan was forced to step down in a huge mass outcry that replaced him with his Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Butto, who later became the president and the first civilian chief martial law administrator.    Members and supporters of the establishment often seemed to have passed comments against its honest critics that the corrupt civilian governments are responsible for establishment to take control of the country’s debilitating condition. My honest reply to them would be, as the saying goes that the best lessons are the hardest learned, when the establishment is not in the power, it is not very far from it either.  Democracy, sir, is the Universal system of governance, which evolves and prospers itself. The fact of the matter is that, it is not the corrupt civil governments that make it incumbent on establishment to interfere in the civil politics, but rather their own desire to stay in the power and making people to believe that they are the only savior.  India, the World’s largest democracy, offers quite a few lessons for our Generals to learn. Rajiv Gandhi’s government was found involved in many cases of alleged corruptions, which actually led to his defeat in the 1989 election. In 1997, the United Front (14 party coalition led by the Janata Dal emerged to form a government) government was confronted with the series of corruption and criminal charges had been leveled against it by the high-profile officials. But, that infact did not provide any kind of justification to the Indian Army to tamper in the political process. What is so different about Pakistan that its establishment has to meddle into everything, the civil governments do?  India has come a long way since its independence in 1947. Look at its diversified industrial base and world-class Information Technology. Look at its software development and financial sector. The problem with Pakistan is that, its establishment has never let democratic, political, social, judicial and constitutional institutions to evolve in the first place. The vision sought by President General Pervez Musharraf for the (Enlightened Moderate) Pakistan is not new.  From gaining control as a mean to stay in the power to talking about modernizing the country by getting financial aids from different countries of the World has almost become a daily slogan of the Generals in Pakistan.  For instance, General Zia-ul-Haq had promised to hold elections with in three years after he declared marshal law and suspended the portion of the 1973 constitution. Infact, he had released Mr. Butto, whom he had arrested earlier and asserted that he could contest the election, which were supposed to be held on October, 1977. But later on, when it became clear that his government would survive, he not only leveled criminal charges against him but also got him convicted. Despite international appeals, Butto was hanged on April 26, 1979. He then, assumed the presidency and called for elections in November. But because of the fear, that PPP would win the elections, in October, 1979, he not only banned the political parties, but also postponed the elections.        Despite MRD (Movement for the restoration of democracy, which was formed in 1980) protest that demanded his resignation, end to the martial law and restoration of the constitution, he proclaimed a National Referendum for December 19th, for his Islamization program and constitutional changes to increase his presidential power in March 1985.  In short, from hanging Mr. Butto, in 1979 to the surreptitious dealings of General Mirza Aslam Baig to influence the elections by using bank-funds and from brushing off the leaders of the stream political parties to the imposition of  the LFO, has left the country in deep trouble, which is still nursing on its previous wounds.  Fareed Zakaria, the editor of the Newsweek International and author of the several books, writes in his recently published book, Future of Freedom-Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, that, “ if genuine liberalization and even democracy come to Pakistan it will not because of its history of illiberal democracy but because it stumbled on a liberal autocrat”.  The problem with Zakaria’s analysis is that it is simply wrong!   Many supporters of the establishment have also argued about that point of view. While indulging in politics of the other countries in order to compare “ours to theirs” has left establishment with no proper plan to raise its level for the betterment of its country and people for that matter.  Their ambition to look up to Turkey or South Korea, carry the same analysis penned by Zakaria. In Turkey, the legendary, Mustafa Kemal’s (who later was known as Ataturk—the father of Turks) political, social, linguistic and economic reforms and attitude continued to form the ideological base for the modern turkey. Although the military has had intervened in the political process in the past, intellectuals have pointed out the impediments caused by its controlled democracy. South Korea, on the other hand, also, has clear phases of militarism and movement towards democracy, in which the establishment has never interfered after it had handed over the power to the politicians.  Unfortunately, in case of Pakistan, which had suffered from the very beginning, none of the democratic, political, judicial and constitutional institution could be established. If General Musharraf had counted himself out of his predecessors and had not repeated the same huge mistakes, I would have accepted Zakaria’s analysis. Regrettably speaking, that is not what is happing in the echelons of the establishment.  The recent comments by US Deputy Defense Secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, that, “I think one of our problems in Pakistan today is that for too long we deprived ourselves of one of the most important instruments of influence” will give new heights to the establishment’ ego, but certainly, will not solve the severe problems faced by Pakistan.      It will be better for America and the people of Pakistan if US tries to make Pakistan—the country its friend by making it clear on the General that it wants to see a prosperous democratic Pakistan, rather than establishment—the institute, which has engulfed the democratic, social, constitutional and economic institutions in its desire to rule the country.  As far as President General Musharraf is concerned, I would just say, that Sir, the problem is not that your honest critics are criticizing you and your establishment, the good thing is that we can move with you in your efforts to improve the situation, only if you want to.

        If This Be Treason, Then Make The Most Of It Mohammad Asim Raza    Controlling  power by authoritarian regimes from by-passing or amending the constitutions in order to get political advantages to crossing the limits enforced by parliaments and judiciary systems have almost become a predicament in most countries of the Third World, especially, the Middle Eastern and South-East Asian countries, with a limpid exception of India . The sense of Democracy in those countries has been used as a movement for change, rather than building up strong, sustainable and free social, political, and constitutional institutions with independent judiciary and system of checks and balances.  Political elites and intellectuals who had rejected the ideas of Liberal Democracies in the early Twentieth-century, have once again seemed to realize the urgency for the change. Their disenchantment can be seen by their speeches, writings and commentaries pushing for the reforms. But their efforts to push for a democratic change have not yet been transubstantiated into themass-constituencies, which are considered to be the most important factor and back-bone, for building up genuine liberal democracies.  For political elites, one of the problems is their inability to reach out to the general public in a way that can motivate them enough to launch any rational and organized movements, in societies dominated by old ideas from Nationalism to Anti-Colonialism and from religious fundamentalism to the Pan-Arab Nationalism. Still, in many of the countries, most people see Colonialism as a core reason and cause, which has impeded the transition to free, democratic and modern societies in the Muslims world. The rhetoric perpetrated by people like Mr. Touqir Hussain, a retired Pakistani Ambassador, that none of the Islamic countries have hardly escaped from the long period of Colonialism is not new.  Many of the world’s leading influential figures like Walter Rodney and Edward Said seemed to have repeated the same arguments made by the Intellectuals of the Third World like chinviezu and Frantz Fanon, one of the most influential theorists, who later joined the Algerian Nationalist Movement.  In his famous book, The Wretched of the Earth, Frantz Fanon, however, accepted the Universal reality by noticing that, “Decolonization unifies that people by the radical decision to remove from it its heterogeneity and by unifying it on a national, sometimes a racial basis”.  The problem is not that simple in terms of cause and effect, as mentioned by Frantz Fanon, that the opulence of Europeans has been founded on slavery and their well being  and  progress have been built up with the sweat and dead bodies of Arabs, Negroes, Indians and Yellow-races. Today, the problems faced by Arab and Muslim countries are more complex in nature.  Still, those who accuse Western Colonialism of the cause for the backwardness and inability of the Muslim countries to embrace Democracy, should go back into the history and find out the facts for themselves, in order to set the record straight. Because, as Aldous Huxley, once said that, “the facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.”  History attests the validity of many invasions made by different powerful Empires on each other, and, Islamic World is no exception to that. For instance, during the 7th-centuray Mecca was midway between the world’s most powerful civilizations, ideologies, philosophies and civil societies. The world most sophisticated and modern weapons were in possession of either the Byzantines or the Persians. For over Eleven hundred years (550 BC to 622 CE), the Persians and Romans controlled the World and fought one another. Then came along the Islamic Empire that not only defeated the Byzantines in the West, but also, the Persians in the East, thus, under the leadership of “Amr-Ibn-As” they were able to attack the fortress of Babylon, which was the World’s greatest military Castle, controlled by the Byzantines.  At this time and moment, one must not forget the World’s other great Empires and Dynasties, such as, the Macedonian Empire, the Mongol Empire, the Chinese Empire, Achaemenid Dynasty (In which thousand of young Persian troops were sent to Greece to destroy Athens and for which Max Weber, once said that, “the Army is a collection of individuals who fight with each other but do not know each other for the sake of those who know each other but do not fight each other), the Aztec/ Inca Empires in America and the Ottoman Empire. History is filled with examples of these World’s powerful Empires. Remember, Afshar Dynasty (the founder, Nadir Shah, had sent thousand of Persians troops to conquer India and dethrone Muhammad Shah, the Mogul emperor).  India, the world’s largest democracy in the third world, had been invaded and conquered by the Persians, the Turks, the Afghans, Alexander the Great and the Arabs before it was invaded and conquered by the British. If India can emerge as a democracy, then why can’t other countries of the Middle East and South East Asia? The population of Muslims in India is more than the population of Muslims in Pakistan. One may ask, is that Democracy incompatible with Islam? The answer to that would, of course, be certainly not. Islam and Democracy can exist together.  The problem with the lack of popular constituencies in the Muslim World is not an Islamic matter. Therefore, it should not be dealt in that perspective. The fact of the matter is that, today, the Muslim World is stuck between despotic regimes and intolerant societies.  By 1964, most of the territories had been replaced by independent countries. In 1946, the Philippines, the former United States colony became free. In 1947, Great Britain divided its former colony India, between the Hindu majority India and the Muslim majority Pakistan. The Dutch let go of the former East Indies, which in 1950 became Indonesia. France was driven out of its former colony Indochina in 1954, which became North and South Vietnam. Similarly, Middle East became free after France and Britain, who had dominated them since 1919, were driven out. Even in Africa, nearly all colonies became free with Algeria in 1960, in which France waged a bloody war against the Algerians.  Between 1940 and 1950, there was much hope that these countries would regain their past potential. It seems, however, strange now. Some thing went wrong between now and then. It had nothing to do with the Western Colonialism and Imperialism for that matter. It had more to do with the despotic and intolerant regimes, which could not produce liberal democracies in those countries.  After having freed from the Western Colonialists, the vacuum was quickly filled with dictators, extremism and religious violence. Name any country, with a little exception of Turkey (the fifth largest Muslim population in the World, a flawed but functioning democracy), Bangladesh (a functioning democracy) and Malaysia (where religious parties are equally allowed to compete openly with other political parties, thus, kept the radicalism under-control), almost all other Muslims and Asian countries have had been under the influence of dictators and kings, who control the absolute power. Thus, became the root-cause of Islamic fundamentalism, which has engulfed the Middle Eastern as well as the South-East Asian countries.  Egypt, has a crucial role in the history, which gave birth to the, what we know now, Islamic Fundamentalism. The ideas like Nationalism started to shuffle into the Arab land during the period of 1920 to 1952, when Wafd, a Group that enjoyed enormous support of the Arabs right after Egypt’s Independence. But later on, their popularity started to decline with the incline of Gamel Abdel Nasser, especially, after the Officers’ coup in 1952. Nasser, the then considered, “The Lion of Egypt”, had used profound language, which influenced the majority of Arabs. His main rhetoric Nationalism, Socialism and Modernization later on, became the rhetoric of the generals from Syria in the Middle East to the Indonesia and to the dictators in Pakistan in the South-East Asia, who consider themselves as the only savior of the people.  But the actual blow to Nassersim and boost to Islamic Fundamentalism came from the Sayyid Qutub an Egyptian (who translated many of the books written by a Pakistani cleric and scholar Abul Ala Maududi). Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s use of audiocassettes gave new  momentum, to the kind of radicalism, which has gotten worse than ever before? In short, from closed societies to the lack of judicial system and from lack of democratic institutions to the absolute powerful dictators are the actual reasons that impede the concept of constitutional liberalism and Democracy to flourish.  On the other hand, America once used to be the colony of the Great Britain has achieved almost every thing through its true passion and desire by adopting Capitalism, Democracy and Constitutional Liberalism, under the leadership of John Hancock, Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson and for which Napoleon Hill once said that, “remember the date September 5th, 1774, which is more important than July 4th, 1776. If there had been no decision to hold the continental Congress, there could have been no signing of the Declaration of Independence”.  In the end, to those who still blame Colonialism for the backwardness and inability of the Muslim countries, let me speak the same classical line once spoken by Patrick Henry (one of Jefferson’s colleague) that, “If this be treason, then make the most of it”.

      Islam's ultimate Mystery Sir,  I am sure that Professional readers and the research scholars desirous of  understanding the mystery of Islam and people who wish to develop the  ability to apply it in given situations will immensely benefit by this  endeavor of Mr. Muhammad Asim Raza.  Mr. Muhammad Asim Raza has tried to enlarge the canvases of his studies by  incorporating theoretical discussion about the obscurity of Islam, suitably  implemented by the references of the well - known authors & research  scholars. This method, together with the arrangement of practical exposure,  is an unparalleled feature which makes it distinct from other editorials as  presented on the web -site.  The achievements of the 20th Century are too numerous to be counted.  However, in the final analysis, the material advancements of this century  have concealed from our eyes the persistent despoiling of human qualities  and the erosion of the moral bases of human culture.  No doubt, this Article is the ideational spearhead of a mighty movement. I  feel proud to state that I am greatly benefited from the writing of Mr.  Muhammad Asim Raza.  I would once again appreciate the efforts made by the author "Mr. Muhammad  Asim Raza" for his great efforts in this field and I am confident that this  Article will go a long way in making the understanding about the Islam  easier to readers due to its easily comprehensive approach. May Almighty  Allah accept his efforts and reward him .  Regards! Asif Khan

      From the time when Islam turned from an "Ideological school of thought" to a "cultural knowledge" and "religious science", it has almost lost its ability to creat any powerful movement, social awareness and responsibility. And held itself back from making any impact on human societies with a very little exception. Muslims need to return to the concept of great Islamic ideology, which is a harmonious collection of philosophical concepts or thoughts, religious beliefs , ethical values, rational understanding and relationship. And this can be done only by Islamic Intellectuals. Because an intellectual is a person who is self-conciously aware of his humanistic-nature both in the social and historical time and place. And, that lays upon him the reponsibility to lead his people in a scientific, social and revolutionary way(when I say revolutionay, I do not mean persuassion of violence). An intellectual is a person who debates with in the religion, different aspects of the same. Scholar, on the other hand, soley gets the information that has already been gathered by either historians or traditions. At this point and moment, I certainly do not want to discuss the great scolars of Islams, neither Allama Talib Johari nor (Late) Nizam-Uddin- Shamzai. Last but not least, there has been quite a few thoughts out there, emphasizing people to learn the language first. With due respect, let me tell you that if only learning the language can make one learn about the relgion than the only people who have understood the religion should be Arabs.But this infact can not be true. One may know the language, but it does not make him or her understand it well. It is just like a poet can understand the poem, only an intellectual can give a right direction. WasSalam, Mohammad Asim Raza

      Ejaz Ahmad   wrote: This is really very nice to c ur mail.I think this is really very fast to communicate the comments to the actual writer. At some point yes you are right that there are lot of things which needs to be debated but the point is that why we are trying to make our selves be little. There are lot of commentry we normally intend to read which absolutely written by people who claim theirselves knowing the lenguage of Quarn Sharif.But the point is that how many of us who claim to be intellectual or tries to challenge the wordings of Quran Sharif or Hadith-e-Nabwi (Sallallahu Alaih-e-Wassallum).My point is that if some body has decided to write on this topic he should certainely be welcomed but this should also be made sure that he has got an authority on the language in which the real law of Islam has been tansformed .Mere following to some one being charismised by their wording is not the correct way of a person having knowledge or has thirst of knowledge. I think we must better understand it clearly 1st & then should start saying something about the belief or understanding of some body else who claims himself a scholar or intelect. But the point is that how &amp; when one should get this acquintance & feel himself fit to do what I am saying, this all depends upon the time he has spent &amp; work he has done & has been reviewed by other knowledgefull people, &amp; obtaining their comments & finally reaching at a stage which justifies his comments &amp; verdict.I think you are in this phase of obtaining the comments of people on your work & poloshing yourself which would ultimately carry you at stage when you could be considered strong enough to be called for commenting on any issue. You should keep it on but here I would add some words that I always try to be unbiase &amp; be honest.What I mean is that at no point of time you should try, conciouslly or unconciouslly, to  please those who are least bothered about the muslims in this world.Which they have proved not merely by words by their acts that they are not only dislike them but also to either finish them up or bring them as down as a slave.This is not necessary to make some one slave by having command on his body but may be by having command on their thoughts,thier soul & atlast on their acts.By making them convinced that lot of things  which is sin in their religion is a debatable matter & such acts are restricted upto their own personality & could even be forgiven by Allah Taa'la.These type of justifications are inflicted just for the sake of convincing people especilly Muslims to commit sins &amp; start to get away from their religion. You know what we are ordered for five things to be done by us to become a muslim ie (1) Kalma(2)Salat( Namaz), (3)Soam ( Roza) ,(4)Zakat ,(5) Haj.You know we are always in the form of Soam (Roza) being a muslim.Is'nt it Roza that we avoid meet at different restuarant as its not halal.We dont drink wine as its prohibited by Allah Taala & Nabi (PBUH).We dont do adultery .If we are following all these things then we are trying to follow orders of Allah Taa'la &amp; it ultimately helps in forming a good society which respects all no mater he/she is a muslim or not. You are right that we should not start hating some body merely due his being non muslim either of any religion. Any way be in touch so that we could make more positive comments &amp; be able to transfer knowledege to each other. Allah Hafiz Ejaz Pirwani
