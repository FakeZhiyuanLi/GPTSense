      ...so anyways...I spent the night at my firend Sean's last night.  We had a great time. It was me, Taylor, Skyler, Brandon, and Sean.  Skyler said that he was going to go home...but we caught a glance of his AIM conversation.  Turns out, he went to a resturaunt...with a girl from a different school to get breakfast (at midnight..).  And..we wouldnt have made anything of it but...he lied to us.  So we went to the same resturaunt!  We sat at a booth right in front of them.  We all got milkshakes and we bought  one  for them.  It had two straws.  Then this like 18 year old chick came up to us and started asking us a bunch of questions...she thought we were stoned (which we were not).  We were a bunch of 16 year olds...luahging our asses off...with milkshakes...at midnight...and my eyes were bloodshot from allergies...we did appear to be stoned.  But we werent.    Then we went back to Sean's house...and watched CKY.  Brandon and Skyler fell asleep...so me, taylor, and sean got them with shaving cream and a feather!  Then...we went into seans room...and found this can of easy cheese...and squirted it on his floor to piss him of...turns out...that can of easy cheese was from Aug 2002....so his room was extremely rank afterwards...  We just kind of fucked around 'till about 5:00 am.  And they all decided to go to sleep.  So i went home...but first i stopped at safeway and bought Coco Puffs.  Then i went to sleep...and nothing happened for much of the day.  But at around 1:00 am...i watched Cowboy Bebop and learned about a drink called a Prairie Oyster.  Basically...its Tomatoe juice and a raw egg...and of course i had to make one.  It wasnt that bad.    Well mamas and papas...im done for now...  -Al

      So anyways...I woke up at around 1:00 pm this afternooon. My "breakfast" was a bowl of skettios. My dad had to get an operation for this bump on his cheek. He's fine.  After he got back I checked out Lollapolooza's website. I really want to go. I just gotta get some tickets...and someone to go with. One of my foavorite bands, String Cheese Incident, is gonna be headlining day 2. I havent really heard of much of the other bands...soooo....I did some 100% illegal downloading on one-a-them p2p thingies (bearshare). I now have a few new favorite bands. The Pixies, The Flaming Lips...yeah.  I then went with my dad over to my grandma's house to...do something. I brought my guitar and recieved praise.  Then I came back home and looked at the comics on www.redmeat.com Oh my God thats some funny shit. New favorite.  Then I decided to get bored and went to my friend Shorty's house....and did nothing except break my car's CD player...fuck. So now I have to buy a new one...with money.  Now I'm back home...im gonna watch a movie or something...I hope Goodfellas is on.  So anyways...bye...  -Al
