       The abuse of Iraqi prisoners in Iraq is disgusting, abhorant and near vomit inducing. American and British soldiers, albeit a minority of them have behaved terribly and individually they should be punished, but at the very top heads must role for these despicable war crimes.  The Red Cross has reported severe concerns of breeches in POW conditions as stated under the Geneva convention, and yes all ye idiots, America has signed up to the Geneva convention. In the British segment Red Cross advice was acted upon, the fact that the abuse ever took place is appaling by itself, but in the American segments abuse continued.  The Arab world will use this again against the west and in particular America, a major figure must go to show that these acts of abuse are simply not tolerated, for the good of all of us. RUMSFIELD MUST RESIGN.

       Exam stress, a stubborn attitude and a slight arrogance on my part have made the last week difficult to say the least. I have been, in the words of one of my 'friends' (you'll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all:   Dear Richard   You may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself "Maybe i am the pathetic one?"   For example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn't want you there, which we obviously didn't considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same 'pathetic' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern't invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself with abuse, yet again another honorable action.   Then i attended Science today happy in the knowledge that i would see my good friends Richard and Polly. However, as you may know the mood turned rather sour when you found my very funny joke somewhat unfunny and went about hitting me in the face.(Which i must add was a pathetic punch)   I feel that the trouble with you Richard is that you are somewhat insecure about yourself, your exact words were "I'm not really bothered by what you are saying, it means nothing to me" if you not bloody bothered then why hit me in the face you idiot if your not bothered then why get in such a shit about everything, why do you make everything worse for yourself squaring up to my best friend storming off in a rage, we are not trying to upset you, it is called a joke if you wern't so pathetic and took it all with a pinch of salt people wouldn't know that it got to you, so wouldn't drill the same old insult, personally your poncy little spack today just made the joke twice as funny, as did it for everybody else in the square after you walked off, hopeing to leave in some sort of dramatic fashion when actually all you did was make yourself look like a complete twat. You wonder why people call you boring, or moody it seems inconceivable to me that you can't see why, this time last week i still thought that you were a genuine decent bloke but you just went and made yourself look like a complete idiot by trying to make somesort of noble stand, resulting, as per usual in everybody else laughing behind your back.   Richard C was right from the very beginning when he told me that you could be a jumped up backstabbing dick, i gave you the benefit of the doubt, but you had to go and shove a number of friendships right up your own ass. Pathetic.   Written by Nik   agreed by Richard    The joke he is refering to by the way, is writing nazi on a photograph of me and drawing a swastika.  I do have to admit he has exagerated these facts ever so slightly, yet it remains me who is the one who needs to apoligise. Considering my actions of the past few days, weeks even, I can see and I do realise that I have behaved in a manner that isn't appropriate, isn't friendly and a manner I simply should not have behaved in. I have apoligised to these people, but I doubt my apoligies will mean much.   I need to consider to myself, what do I want to get from this life? Happiness of course, and if this is what I want, why I am going about it like this, clearly the wrong way. Why am i ruining friendships that took an age to build, with people I actually do get on with, despite thier frequent need for racist comments. I have decided the best strategy by far is too keep my head down until way after exams now, but I'm not sure they'll have the same idea. It seems to me that I have taken a feeling of self belief too far and stepped in the realm of feeling some kind or arrogant self importance.  Things need to change, and they need to change now, I can only hope that I can change myself before I lose even more friends.

       Perhaps a slight exageration, but tomorrow is my last GCSE exam! This momentus event in my life so far will be a 2 hour history exam on the subject of Germany between the wars, now you don't get any more exciting than that.  So this is the end of my secondery education, the end of an era you might say. After this point I shall be moving on into the world, tomorrow marks a conerstone in my life.  Okay, so now I've written a lot of waffling nonsense about that lets see whats been going on today. Um, not a lot, football tonight has been funny, final games of group C in Euro 2004. Italy played Bulgaria and Sweden played Denmark. Before the game it was widely publicised that both Sweden and Denmark would progress to the next round if thier game ended in a score draw of higher than 2 - 2. This was of course followed by the famous Azzuri excuse machine going into overdrive, "it will be a conspiracy" they shouted, "we worry they might fix it" vieri was quoted as saying. So guess what the final score was? Yep 2 - 2, never have I laughed so hard at a football result. So Sweden top the group, Denmark come second and Italy and Bulgaria are going out. This match certainly wasn't a stitch-up, but it is a very, very funny result. If Jonsson hadn't scored that late equaliser for Sweden, Italy would have been spared.  Alas, tomorrow night is a much more important game for myself, it awaits to be seen whether Germany can actaully become good at football suddenly to beat the Chezch Republic. I shall be out celebrating the end of exams with my phone constantly buzzing with score updates.  Which brings me on to the proposed events of tomorrow night. A piss up in a field. Yes, thats right, we shall be going out and doing the most stereotypical of teenage taboos, we shall be going to a field in the evening with some beers and some cider and getting sloshed. Oh the joys.  For now, I must flee, for there is much last minute, panic revision to be done.

        urlLink Germany 0 latvia 0 , not a great game at all.   As promised I shall explain my reasons for my disent towards Ukip. Ukip are a party controlled by a idiot, spun by an American and whose lead candidate in the European elections is a bigoted racist with a permanent sun tan.      To move on from the childish reasons, the Independent on June 16th put it nicely, describing just what leaving the EU means, it  urlLink truly is a £23Bn question . Not only is it sheer lunancy to leave the EU, the largest free trade area in the world and the greatest single benifit to UK interests, the alternatives proposed by Ukip are terrifying to say the least.  They want Britain to leave the European Union, but they are in favour of economic globalisation, and a stronger role for the US dominated World Trade organisation (WTO). The WTO which is already forcing genetically modified US goods into British supermarkets; the WTO that puts global free trade before environmental regulation; the WTO that undermines national laws to push its own economic rules on nation states. While Ukip say they are concerned about independence from Brussels paradoxically they are perfectly prepared to surrender our sovereignty to the WTO and the US.  Similarly Ukip dangle before the electorate the enticing possibility of joining the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) to replace the EU, cementing Britain’s place as the 51st state of America. Unfortunately however this would allow American companies to be free to sue British companies for loss of profits if they tried to impose health and safety or environmental laws that according to NAFTA’s frankly bizarre definition of free trade discriminates against these companies.  Rather more worryingly, Ukip have almost identical policies to the BNP on migration and asylum; many UKIP parliamentary candidates have been former National Front or Northern League of New Britain Party activists, hence UKIP have been dubbed "the BNP with smiling faces.” I only have to point your attention to Robert Kilroy-Silk, who made horrifically stereotypical comments about Arabs describing them all as “suicide bombers, limb amputators and women repressors.”  Ukip is an unrealistic political party composed almost entirely of white middle-aged men who seem determined to try and return Britain to an imagined 1950s golden age. It's not going to happen, Britain is stong when in Europe, strong when at the heart of Europe, strong when she can speak alongside her European allies to provide a counter-balance to the lunatic US foreign policy of late.  Recently after Ukip's supposed election breakthrough (15% of the votes from an uninformed and uninterested electorate), they have vowed to 'wreck' the European parliament, so they don't just want to 'wreck' the UK by withdrawing it, they want to ruin the institution that is bringing economic, social and political benifits to the rest of the EU. Selfish? Go and play your mindless political games elseware Mr Kilroy-Silk and let the people of the EU enjoy the peace and prosperity that a stable and united Europe has brought to us.

       Exams are all but over now (I have food technology and History left but they really arn't important), so the long summer has all but begun. This can only mean one thing, time for a lot of drunken parties, lounging around doing nothing in particular and eventually and very reluctently accpeting that I shall have to get a job once I begin to run out of money.  As I write this its half time in the Germany vs. Latvia match in Euro 2004, I expect I'm one of very few people in England cheering on Germany, often in a match like this the whole nation become honourary supporters of the opposition. The English have always disliked the Germans and as far as I can see always will, no doubt there are very deep physchological reasons for this none of which I can be bothered to venture into now.  Throughout the country theres a lot of rather messy upheaval regarding Europe and Britains place in the EU, something I feel quite strongly about as a person who considers himself to be 'European' rather than 'British' (this is because one of my grandparents is Irish the other German) and I feel particuarly strong ties to both these countries. I'm personally disgusted by the gains of the far right UK independence party at the European parliament elections last week for reasons I shall venture into after the second half of the football.  Caio for now.
