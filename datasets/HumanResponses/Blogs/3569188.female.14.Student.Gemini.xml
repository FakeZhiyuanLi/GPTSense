      Well, Erika and I have just recently gotten done with the most retarded game ever...not so much retarded as gay..but whatever. Anyhoo, I think that I never want to play it again, as of right now, but- knowing me and my indecisive nature, I will be back and playing it next week :-P.  I am really tired.

      Alirght, so today sucked. Biug deal. I have never really gotten excited about Birthdays. I am really disappointed in Erika. I figure I am just not gonna bring it up, so she will eventually realized it's passed, and feel awful. I don't know, aren't I mean? I don't care. So anyway, tonight I am going to completely organize my closet and room and get rid of everything I don't need. Yikes..I am such a packrat that this is gonna be hard. I'll get it done somebow. Once that is accomplished, I plan on designing a new blog or site layout. I don't know which one I want to do right now, but most likely it'll be the site. I am going to do a black/red/pink theme- you know, eventual color fading and stuff. It should be cool.   I need to start working on the violin. I had so many summer goals, I just need to start breaking up the time of summer and start planning everything out. I am going to bed early tonight so that I can get up early and go running. It's gonna be a good summer if I can keep myself busy. I admit- I am still hung up on Corey. I feel bad about Nate. I mean, I used him in a way to try to distrat myself. But I don't know..it's just that I have this wierd spot for Corey in my heart as a friend and that seems to be affecting the way I still feel about him. One of the most dragged out crushes ever. I'll get over it. Just need to keep distracted. Grr, I am so angry at myself for becoming attatched at all. I mean, it was one year and I've already let 2 people in. THat's two more than I would prefer. I don't like it..I have good reason too. What's the point of letting people get close to you if you are only gonna get hurt. That's why it's casual dating and superficial teenage relationships for me next year, thanks. Whatever. I need to have more of an open heart. I mean, the problem I have is that it's so big and gullible. I hope nobody ever finds out how to work me. If they can get that close :-P. Not gonna happen.  So anyway, I need to drink more water, I am totally dehydrated. Still mad at Erika a little. I don't know why I get so annoyed with this, but I don't know. Wish me luck with running in the morning...it'll be torture. ;-)

      I just found this thing that makes your text glow around the edges. Just testing it out:      I found one for images too, but I closed out of the page before copying the code. I am an idiot ;-).              Still playing with the glow filter today. Wanna play?

      Alright..so it's not 'neglection' parse, but it'll do justice to describe how I am feeling. Erika totally forgot my Birthday! I mean, she went to the beach with Stori, and then she's going off to celebrate Stori's B-Day later. Grr to her. Anyhoo..  Corey remembered. He would though..he knows what it's like to not have anyone remember. So far today, I have pretty much wasted the day. I watched Charlie's Angels; Full Throttle (which is so completely gay), then I cleaned, and then that's pretty much it besides the internet. Total waste. I think I might clean out my closet later...fascinating experiences for a fascinating Birthday. Whatever. Well, write later maybe.

      I am really tired. Uggh. I just transferred all of my entries from ebloggy.com to here. Not many, so it wasn't that bad. Tomorrow is monday..I am supposed to go running and start putting my nose to the grindstone (grindstone?or is it grind your nose to the stone? or to the limestone...???) well, whatever. Anyhoo...(been saying that word a lot lately) Tomorrow I think I might call Mary. Don't know. I still can't believe that it's summer. It's not hot enough yet. Guess I just haven't gotten into my routine..well tomorrow's my chance.   Tomorrow is my birthday. In about 8 mins I will be 14. Well, not technically until like, 4 in the afternoon, but poo on technicallity. Omg, I just said the word poo...I really am losing it. Whatever...(been saying that word a lot too..hmm..). I am gonna wait and see if anybody remembers my birthday tomorrow..I doubt it. Nobody really cares. Erika might remember, but I don't care if she does. To be honest, I kind of want people to forget so I can blame them. That's so mean, but I guess it's just me. I don't know, I am trying to figure out who I  really  am, but what if I don't like that person? I most likely will, seeing how I surround myself with people like me..I don't know.   Corey's still on my mind..deciding whether or not it would be a good thing to see him much this summer. I don't know...I mean, I don't want to get any closer to him. I am already freaking out with the way things are. I mean, it's like I just break down around him and I don't hold anything in! Isn't there something completely messed up with that? I don't know, I just don't like people to know me...I feel limited and they form their own assumptions and I am no longer free to be just me, which is dually hard when I don't know who 'me' is. Anyhoo..I don't know. It's like he has this wierd control over me. I can't put my finger on it right now..maybe later. But I mean, I dont' really get mad at him, and if I do (which has happened like, twice) It's just because I want to be, and because I am really stupid. Grrr to you COrey Shotwell! I guess I will just have to deal with it. (Feel more sorry for him- he's got the end wehre he has to listen to me complain and whine :-P).   Well, it's 11:59 on the computer clock. Waiting...   12! Well, I am unofficially 14 years old. Omg..that's really wierd..anyway. Got to get to bed and stuff. Write later..most likely tomorrow.   -lyss-

      So bored today. Went to my baptism class, came back and took quizzes. Erika and I went to the park. We climbed over the stupid fence that's like, 8 feet tall, and Erika was afraid to jump about 2ft from the trash can to the ground. She's not a very good partner in crime, but as Corey isn't here (and even if he was, he wouldn't do anything cause he's such a wimp about breaking rules) she's good enough. So I get inside and we decide it would be funny to put an orange cone on top of the shed...I don't know  why , but hey, come on- it's summer and we were super-bored. So it's up there and I am like, ok, that's waaay too noticable, so I try to step down, except Erika wasn't paying attention and forgot to sturdy the bin I was standing on. So I like, fall and this brick thingy lands on my leg and Erika starts laughing hysterically. So we are sitting there- cone on the roof, me being physically impared, and Erika making a ton of noise. So I am sitting there and going, "SHHHHH! ERIKA, shut up!" and then I was freaking out about the cone in case somebody saw it, and then Erika tries to hit it down with a mop and I am still stuck in the bricks, and then the crappy stuff is falling off the mop onto my face and we are freaking out. So eventually we fixed the situation, and we went back home.......to get tools. :-P   So we come home, get two phillips screw drivers, a monkey wrench, a hammer, and wire cutters. Instead of going in depth to all of our little 'adventures', heres a list:   -unhinging a shed door to see what's inside (i got bored and only followed half way through)  -carving initials into shed  -erika carving initials of who she likes into tree (not so bad)  -me puncturing the school's hose (hey, it's our tax money! and besides, Erika told me...:-P)  -Carving my initials into a fence  -both erika and I slashing 'z's into the screens (zorro theme!)   Yikes! I feel like a bad-girl. I love it! Total adrenaline rush...didn't know I was that way...Anywhoo...   Here are my results from quizzes today:     You represent... hope.

His sign is the eclipsed sun.     As a member of Form 0, you are a determined individual. You tend to keep your sense of optomism, even through tough times and have a positive outlook on most situations. You have a way of looking at going through life as a journey that you can constantly learn from.

      I'm sitting here, crying over the keyboard. I don't know what I am going to do. I just feel like- nothing. I feel empty and I feel lonely, and I feel completely unloved. I hate life. I sometimes feel like everyone else's life would have just been better if i hadn't been born, or if I died. It's so pathetic though...of course people would be sad. Very few though.   I just want somebody to hold on to, who can tell me everything is going to be alright, and I don't have that. School is out, the only friends I see are Corey and Erika...My mom hates me, my dad is completely horrible, and my sister hates me like she always has. Kevin hates me...I think that a few people in school liked me, but school is out and I don't know who to turn to.  Erika is really pathetic. She has to have everything her own way, and she is the center of the universe. Anyone who declares otherwise, should run for his life. I mean, I just hate her. And it's real. I mean, I just don't like her at all, and I wish she would die. Watch, tomorrow I will be all- I love Erika, but from now on...I don't know.  I hate me! Why the hell is everything so messed up. We were talking and Erika had brought up something about Corey and me being a pushover. She says that I am stubborn and I always have to argue and stand up to people and then I claimed that I didn't- for example Corey. And she said that he's got control over me, and I realized that she's right. I don't know why...I mean, it's like Corey's a special case...and with me, that's definitely something when it comes to me standing up for myself. Why do I let anybody have that control over me? I just can't let him find out because it would give him complete control over me and he's too much like me already. He would work me and get what he wanted way too much...Love is blind, and I love him as a friend...but I love Erika, and yeah, I still do, yet I argue with her so much it's not even funny.  Omg...I am a weak person today. Tomorrow I am going in the pool and that's all I want to do. I would be so happy to fricken drown while swimming. It would be perfect..except I am utterly afraid of drowning. Whatever..I babble. I don't know what I am going to do with myself.  Best Friends as of This Morning:  -Corey -Kellie -Erika  I miss Kellie. She had her date with Lance last night...wonder how it went. :-) She probably wasn't paying attention for most of the movie. Whatever. Everyone loves Kellie...  Well, I am gonna go to sleep and stop dwelling on my retarded problems for a couple of hours. I love having this, I don't need to complain to people as much...

      Yaaay! It's summer, and I am really, really happy. First time in quite a while. I have so much that I need to focus on this summer. I guess it's dedicated to self improvement. More on that later.   I am so pissed at Erika. She is so retarded sometimes. She's annoyed that I always need the last word, and yeah, I guess that can get annoying but listen: I was arguing with my dad and I was disagreeing and attempting to get the last word subconsciously and Erika like, storms off because I was doing it. I don't even understand why she thinks that she has the right to just get all angry because I was arguing with someone else. Frankly, I don't give a crap, so whatever.   Went to PoA with Corey, Shelly, and Erika this morning. It was at the IMax and it was pretty cool. Erika and I got there early and we had to sit through this documentary about caribou. Then Shelly and Corey got there and the movie started after a little while. Once the movie started, i was a little annoyed because of the excess cuddling (corey-shelly). I mean, I can understand the hand holding and stuff, but it's just really annoying to me, and i don't know why. Erika was even more annoyed. Don't know why she even cares..anyway.   I am so bored. I can't wait until the pool is done tomorrow, I am going to go swimming! I am so excited. I got to jump in before Erika :-P. FIrst time ever...and it's my pool to begin with! Whatever. Grrr, she annoys me right now. Anyway, I guess I will stop writing...not much to do besides internet which sound completely boring. Maybe I will go for a run or something. I could play the violin...babbling now, must go.
