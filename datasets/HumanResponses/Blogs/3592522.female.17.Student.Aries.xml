        Slaving over the hot deep fryer,  hands coated in sticky batter  he comes begging into my kitchen,  asking for my fritters with a grin.  Seeing my partners fried veggies,  he gags and leaves in a frenzy  "No offense to you " says he  Turning away, "fuck you" says me.  He comes back asking for one,  Should I lie and say there's none?  But I hand him the best Fritter,  Noticing how his blue eyes glitter.

        Maybe someday you will see me,  not for my ugliness or my clothes,  not for my constant running nose  or my addiction to things that glow.   You will see me for the first time,  for my uniqueness and creativity,  for my allergies and fragility,  and the special things that make -  me Me.

        I havent seen you for over a year,  we've both matured and moved on,  your girlfriend goes to my school,  and my ex follows me in the halls.   I hardly recognized you standing there,  beside my locker, looking so fine,  remembering the times that we shared,  feeling sorry for letting you go.   A glance is all it takes to notice,  one glance is all it took and I felt,  everything that i've ever felt for you,  return in a heartbeat and a blink.   You phoned me when I least expected,  your voice brings back the memories,  equally haunting and pleasing to recall,  wondering what it would be like -  ... if maybe next time we werent caught.

        I let you fuck with my head,  fuck reality, and see you in hell,  I wish you played with someone else,  I wish all of you to be dead.   Death is a great escape,  it's almost like love in a sense,  fucking with people's minds,  clueless people they joyfully rape.   Fucked over too many times,  because of you, it's not the same,  your ego brought me down,  i'm sick of it all, sick of your kind.

        I hate the way you look at me,  seeing you through my tears,  i try so hard to please,  only hurting in return.   I hate the way you play with me,  Throwing myself at your feet,  Trying so hard to change...  Do you even care?   I hate the way you're there for me,  when i'm scared, hurt or alone,  I'm trying not to feel for you,  ..it's only getting easier.   Each day i'm played a little,  a hug here, a push away there,  your confusion only hurts me,  i just want another chance.   What do i have to do,  to only make you see?  "give it a little time"  i say: "have a little faith"   I hate how i feel like a fool,  I want to make you happy,  I have to think of myself,  And i hate letting go.

        I knew when i first fell in love,  You were so different and sure,  Muscles showing through your shirt,  and a smile just for me.  You laughed at my corny jokes,  shared your music in the halls,  Took me out and claimed me yours,  and gave me the world.   I knew when i gave up on love,  when the tears began to flow,  spending more time with your friends,  i was just your whore.  I had changed too much for you,  Needs you couldn't full-fill (sp)  Dreams you wouldn't be part of,  We grew apart by miles.   I know that i can love another,  when my soul is fully healed,  when my heart stitches together -  all the pieces that it lost.  Slowly you fade from my veins,  whispers of forever - gone,  promises of love - forgotten,  I will be happy and survive,  Learning to breathe on my own.

       The goldfish are watching,  through a world barred by glass,  and when you least expect it,  they will turn their fins on you-  and devour every move you make.  Laughing at our primitive ways,  they secretly gather during the night,  to plot the biggest plot of them all,  to rule and conquer the world-  and the end of our "superiour" race.  The goldfish are watching,  taking note on your every thought,  there are no halos over these creatures,  and if you listen you will hear them-  soft whispers of evil and death.

       Metal pumping, frees my soul-  from the pain you inflicted  and the grip that you hold.  Taking me to another world  of obsession of sex  nothing hidden, everything's bare.  Through the bass and rage,  he gently injects me,  filling me with liquid heat.  Taking my hand he leads me  through the gates of hell  the drug takes care of everything  there's nothing there but him.  He looks at me with empty eyes-  holds me close and pulls me under  to the darkness in the shadows,  and safety of his world.

        Roses are black,  The red bled away,  Leaves fallen dead,  Thorns evilly sway.  Smell has gone rotten,  Death grew its beauty,  Thriving on pain,  Blooms its cruelty.

       You are the only one that knows,  the pain that haunts me,  that shackles my feet to the dirt.  You are the only one that knows,  the fantasies I burn for,  that bind my hands to the wall.  You are the only one that knows,  the things I want to hide from,  that prod inside my head.  You are the only one that knows,  What my soul needs,  and you're nowhere to be found.

       I'm sittin here listenin to 80's songs  Songs of heartache striking home  Lookin at every man passing by  Hoping it's him to still my heart.   Everything around me is part of him  Every song played, joke told, places I go  Can be traced back to when we were one  My heart sings tears of pain only for him.   My soul is crying out in sorrow  Like a lone wolf howling in the wind  I want nothing more than to feel his touch  And a simple goodbye, to be released.   I am jealous of the love everyone shares  Feeling cheated, Why am I left out?  His emotionless "love" has cut me  So deep that even my shadow bleeds.

       Your arms wrap tightly around me  like a vice protecting me from the world,  I turn around and gaze at your face  Masculine and strong, yet so beautiful.   The warmness of your ageless eyes  Makes me want to part from the shadows,  and join you in the light of happiness  Where nothing could cause us any pain.   Your lips speak of heartfelt promises  My tongue tells stories of past heartache,  like a helpless bug trapped in your web  I lay my trust in you not to destroy me.   What is left of me I give to you.  Trying to keep a grip on reality  As you bite into me with hungry lust,  bringing me fully into your world of light.

       You spiteful words ring in my ears  your hateful glare makes everything clear  you hate me not because i am of your blood  but because i am nothing like you.   I feel your hate whenever i am near  no more "i love yous" in cards  i never was your little princess  you are the reason i hate myself .. and everything a family stands for.   You physically destroyed me when i was small  You emotionally scarred me when i got bigger  I got bigger and started to fight back with grades,  To change things and make you proud of me.   Grades, boyfriends, friends - I was never good enough for you  You found a reason to put me down for everything i did  Now in my final year of high school you say "fuck your grades"  Do something productive and get a fucking job.   When i was younger you gave me nightmares  I dreamt of hereos saving me from the beast that you are  They never came and i tried to kill myself  You blamed me for your medication and problems that i caused.   I dont want to be involved in your problems  I dont even care anymore that you dont give a shit about me  Leave me alone for a year is all i'm asking  And i'll be out of your goddamned hair.   One more push and i'll explode  One more harassment and you'll see  The dark side of me that's begging.  For a chance to break free.

       We don't even need to touch,  we're living borders apart,  yet i can feel your breath  intoxicating my body.   Your gaze lightens my heart,  with a click of a mouse  we can be together  our souls closing the distance.   A mexican and german,  unite against the odds,  Promises not spoken,  inside we already know.   Our day will come to meet,  we'll greet with a smile  and we'll never part sides  Our fate tightens with each day.   You are my one addiction  i refuse to leave and sleep  until i talk with you--  My Angel in Mexico.

       I can feel Him outside my window,  His gaze upon my patched soul,  Tidings of death whisping through,  blackened visions of my life.   I see how i am alone,  How my family is chained together,  I have broken the sacred link,  And my friends nowhere in sight.   I welcome Death's soothing gaze,  The metal He binds around my neck,  Is the most comforting feeling,  Of which I never want to be unbound.
