      8 DAYS!!!  It's the beginning of a long weekend, and I couldn't be happier!  Two days ago, I hadn't any plans, and suddenly my social calendar is filled to the point of ALREADY being exhausted!!   Went out with JT last night for drinks (well, he was drinking, I was sipping water).  We wanted to go to Havana's, but since my episode the night before with Y (the one where we went up to the manager to explain why we didn't leave a tip.. I suspect I'd slept with our waitress' boyfriend at some point because it was beyond terrible) I was feeling a bit cautious about going back (the very next night, no less).. luckily she wasn't working AND they wouldn't accept JT's Amex so we had to go next door.  We had a great dinner, and it struck me as funny that we have such a great friendship again after everything that's happened this past year.  Weird that at one point he said we'd dated for a year, and actually it was a 7 month stint, then 3 mnths later, a 3 week desperate attempt (and failure) at reconcilliation.  Anyhow, as usual, he picked up the tab.  I am, after all, looking after his kitty while he goes away (one of the reasons it never would have worked - he's gone 3 wks out of every month and i just need to have sex more often than that).  We didn't sleep together.  I can't help but wonder if this was because I wasn't drinking.   Just got back from coffee this morning with an internet man.  S'ph was cute but SHORT, and I mean,  really  short.  A part time comedian, I think he was trying a few new jokes on me (they flopped).  All in all (or, in SHORT) he was cute, but I don't see any potential.   This weekend, I will be meeting Derek (another first time date from my trusty internet matchmaker), Ivan (we haven't seen each other since that weekend awhile ago), and P (not sure where this one is heading).  I will also be hanging with Nicky at the beach and heading to the Pride Parade with some friends....  funny how things get so busy so fast.   Let's see if I can last the weekend alcohol free.

      J&nbsp;says:&nbsp;S is talking about kids and marriage with me J&nbsp;says: um.....? J says: not till after Jamaica.... J says: but maybe that will be like my staggette!! Sassy says: do you feel the same? J says: confused.  Sassy says: why? J says: i was thinking in the car today about him... his personality compliments mine in alot of ways.. but it's long distance, and how much time have i even spent with him?? Sassy says: exactly but sometimes when you know...you just know J says: when he was here, i knew it was great. J says: anyhow, i've already talked to&nbsp;X about transferring back to T.O. so i think that will be done within the year. Sassy&nbsp; says: what did they say J says: they said NP Sassy says: cool J says: when something comes open, they'll tell me J says: things come open all the time, so i'm not worried J says: and they like me. so lots of choices J says: anyway, so my short term is to get back home. i've made friend here, but i'm not settled or grounded. feels like everything i do is just to fill space in my life, i need these things to BE my life. does that make sense? Sassy says: yup Sassy says: but I guess the question is are you going to settled here? J says: i wonder that too.  J says: but if i have to choose, T.O. is better J says: i have friends there, people who really know me. i'm a bit scared i'll fall into the same rut again, but then, maybe i just needed to be here for a year or two and i'll have a diff perspective when i'm home J &nbsp;says: also, i really want to be in a relationship that works for me... not with just anyone, but i think that i'm ready for that. and i have a serious disconnect with the men here.... i know they aren;'t perfect at home, but the lifestyle is more my speed. J says: am i talking outta my ass? Sassy says: I hear yeah Sassy says: well you need to figure out what it is you need and want and go for it and if you think you can do that better here than go for it J says: i also think that alot of this is that i was raised with the belief that family is so important. i think i've been so unsettled the past few years because i'm really missing that in my life.. i can't do anything about my screwed up parents, but i would like to be close to Char/Reid/Eric and my own cousins again. also, maybe i just need to start my own family (whatever that means) to fill some kind of void that I can't fill with the existing one J says: no rush here, but the process is long, and i don't want this meaningless shit anymore Sassy says: I know the feeling J says: don't you miss me????? don't you want me back for selfish reasons?????? J says: dammit woman, gimme some love Sassy says: to begin your own life Sassy&nbsp; says: you know I do shit head  J says: jerk off Sassy says: but you have to do what makes you happy Sassy says: lol J says: don't tell me that this is the proverbial TICKING CLOCK!!>>>>> J says: omigod. J says: no. Sassy&nbsp; says: I think so Sassy&nbsp; says: It has to happen eventually J says: i swore this would never happen Sassy says: why? J says: i pinky swore J says: lol Sassy says: lol J&nbsp; says: i didn't want to be one of those crazed mid 30 women, running around trying to conceive Sassy&nbsp; says: I want it to happen but its so hard to find that one person that you'd want to spend your life wiht J says: EXACTLY Sassy&nbsp; says: no..we're not like that J says: and i wonder if i'm too picky... but then again, if you have to choose only one, you HAVE to be picky Sassy says: but I think we are getting sick of the entire dating bullshit and want to just find that special person and start our own families instead of wasting time in bars with guys that talk out of their ass J says: yup J says: ass talk is so 2003 Sassy says: lol

      It's taken me a very long time to be comfortable in a relationship, and i'm not even sure that i still am.&nbsp;&nbsp;i feel very unlike the "me" that i know/love when i'm in a relationship.....&nbsp;needy, anxious... feel like i'm always "waiting".. be it&nbsp;for the other shoe to drop, for someone to leave, for my personality to find a home again.&nbsp; it's not easy taking two totally different people, thinking, feeling independently...&nbsp; from two totally different lives and experiences.. and then mashing them together like a big fat casserole.&nbsp;   Stayed at Craig's last night. Had a bit of a chat and I think we have an understanding, although only time will tell.&nbsp; I actually felt more like myself than I have the whole time we've been dating.&nbsp; It felt good...&nbsp;simple and clear.&nbsp; I felt strong and I think that's where I've finally&nbsp;found&nbsp;my comfort zone with him.&nbsp; Some men just need to know where the limits are.&nbsp; They push and push till you snap and then&nbsp;they retreat.&nbsp; WHY must it come to that?&nbsp; It's up to him now, so we'll see. If he can pull his shit together maybe we have hope.&nbsp; But goddamn, the sex is just so fucking hot.&nbsp; Why has that become such a tough thing to find?  11 days

      12 days and counting till my vacation...&nbsp; simply can't wait and now i'm in full-on "training" mode.&nbsp; It gets easier to get up at 5 am and head to the gym or for a run, the closer i get to the day of departure.&nbsp; Easier also, to go back to the gym that same night and train even harder.&nbsp; The simple idea of people seeing me in next to nothing (or even nothing at all, after a few drinks and general desensitization) is enough to keep me motivated.&nbsp; Enough to make me feel REALLY guilty about that piece of dry toast this morning....&nbsp; am i being obsessive?&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; But it's all for the greater good.  This weekend was comedy.&nbsp; On Friday night, I went out for Mary's birthday.&nbsp; Had an awesome time, getting home around 7am Sat morning.&nbsp; Was tempted at one point to indulge in a few party favours, but thought better of it.&nbsp; I had already been drinking quite a bit, and although that doesn't usually it deter me, it always guarantees a brutal hangover and i just didn't want to ruin the whole weekend.&nbsp; The group consisted of Mary's friends, and some people from work... and while I had a great time, it was certainly a night filled with drama.&nbsp; At one point, while i was hanging from some ceiling pipes, Mary's friend Curtis was standing between my legs (which were hooked, by my stillettos, around the pipes) and making some suggestions about ways to make me a bit more "comfortable".&nbsp; Minutes later, he's making out with Mary, and a few moments after that, his girlfriend introduced herself (who, incidentally, is not into this whole scene).&nbsp; Strange, since he had told me that she just moved out.&nbsp; Perhaps this is my fault, assuming that he meant they were no longer together.... but she obviously was of a different opinion.  I left with some of the guys from work.&nbsp; We went to another club, as I was bored and it was either another venue or home for me.&nbsp; I met one guy "N" who is a chef at a downtown hotel.&nbsp; I invited myself to dinner, promising to bring the wine.&nbsp; He called me on Sunday, so it looks promising, but who knows...??!!&nbsp; Met another guy, Pete, who had a kick ass body (no, really, i'm usually pretty unimpressed and jaded, but this was unreal) but was wearing a baseball hat pulled down over his face.&nbsp; Being that i'm a "face" person, I let him know that the hat was coming off, on his terms or mine.&nbsp; After a bit of a fight, it was off and OMIGOD > his face was mashed.&nbsp; Too bad really....&nbsp; was nice (and like i mentioned...&nbsp; killer body) but i had to walk away.&nbsp; Shallow?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But a girl has to have  some  standards.  Saturday, I got a call around 11am inviting me to the Indy.&nbsp; Feeling a bit green, but not one to pass up an invite, I pulled myself together and headed out.&nbsp; The people watching was amazing, but holy shit, what is up with the way girls dress in this city???&nbsp; That afternoon, I headed home and then to a bridal shower for my younger cousin.&nbsp; I nearly fell over when I learned that not only had she met him in bible college, but this was he ONLY boyfriend.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; We share the same genes???&nbsp; That night, against my better judgement (and a few drinks/advil later) I got myself dressed and headed out once again.&nbsp;   Things are getting tricky at a club I like to frequent.&nbsp; The bartender there is not my type physically, but so fucking amazing and cool that his invitations to go out sometime are becoming more tempting.&nbsp; I simply HATE the idea of messing around with a good bartender, but it's almost worth risking.&nbsp; Must think more about this.&nbsp; Met a guy that night who was pretty cool, but of course, friends and co workers of Aidan.&nbsp; When he asked if Aidan would know me, I said yes... but might have also said that if he described me as "the cleopatra looking girl that used to fuck his brains out and who would let him choke her during really intense bouts".&nbsp; I ended up giving him my number, so that he could "fly me to LA for sushi" (honestly, this was the invitation).&nbsp; I love my life.&nbsp;   Sunday was calmer, but kind of sad.&nbsp; A going away/bridal shower for a friend where we all started to realize that in less than a month, she will no longer be here.&nbsp; San Fran will be fantastic and fun, but the selfish part of me wants her to stay.&nbsp; All my friends are leaving.&nbsp; Fine, Aidan was a fuck buddy (but a damn fine one) and Y is actually a friend, but the point is that they're leaving as fast as I'm finding them out here.&nbsp;   Toronto is calling me back home.&nbsp;   Called Craig back Sunday, only to get a text msg telling me he's missed me, blah blah.&nbsp; Sick of the games, actually wanting something a bit more stable.&nbsp; Well, after I get back from vacation anyway.&nbsp; Call it my unofficial staggette before settling into coupledom.&nbsp;

      Whoa!&nbsp; What the hell is going on??&nbsp;   I'm in such a shit mood today.&nbsp; Tired, sensitive, cranky, solitary.&nbsp; And, my shoulders are killing me.&nbsp; A girl in my office was trying to get the knots out, I think to keep me from bitching.&nbsp; It kind of worked, but not gone completely.&nbsp; I don't know if it's sexual frustration, lack of sleep or the fact that I am 3 days off carbs, but holy fuck, I need to snap out of it.  Went to my gay boyfriend's house last night.&nbsp; His partner is out of town, and he made me dinner. A lovely curried chicken, with appies and wine.&nbsp; I swear we're dating and I just don't know it.&nbsp; He has been in a gay relationship for 3 years, but he's only 23, and before that dated only women.&nbsp; He and his partner have an "open" gay relationship, but his b/f would not be impressed with any mucking around with women.&nbsp; Funny that.&nbsp; One of his friends joined us for dinner and I was amazed by the natural flow of conversation.&nbsp; You simply don't see that in groups of women that have only just met.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beefore I knew it, I was about to turn into a pumpkin.&nbsp;   It occured to me, as I was sitting on R's couch watching him make dinner, that I finally have friends and a social life here.&nbsp; That just kinda snuck up on me, really.&nbsp; Wasn't it just yesterday that I was complaining that I missed having a life???&nbsp; Now what am I left to complain about?&nbsp; The usual, I suppose....&nbsp; dating, work and general malaise.  Since R and I kissed that one night, weeks ago, I've noticed a bit of a strange tension.&nbsp; Maybe we should just sleep together and get it over with.... I mean, the quickest way to end sexual tension is just to act on it.&nbsp; Especially if it turns out to be way below par.&nbsp; But then, kissing him was strange enough... I told him that I could tell he had been kissing men for 3 years.&nbsp; He was forceful and&nbsp;needy, with a desperate urgency that I haven't often seen in a first kiss with a straight man.&nbsp; It was almost the way I would imagine that two men might kiss...&nbsp; as a necessary social grace, to simply introduce a good hard fucking.&nbsp;   Back to work.&nbsp; Have to get some things done so that I can spend a few mid day hours at the gym, get back to the office, and then spend yet another night schmoozing clients.&nbsp; My life is not my own these days.&nbsp; Oops, there I go being whiny again.&nbsp; I promise, I'll feel better tomorrow.

      More than a few things going on in the dating world these days, which is slightly unfortunate considering my upcoming trip.&nbsp; I just don't want guilt or any of that shit preoccupying me when I should be focusing on myself for those glorious 7 days. &nbsp; Craig called last night.&nbsp; I'm not sure why.&nbsp; I haven't returned the call and I'm not sure when/if I will.&nbsp; After the way things ended, I'm not sure that I have the time to waste on him anymore.&nbsp; On the one hand, I've got this burning curiosity - WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?? I have a pretty strong idea that he just wasn't willing to be involved with someone who was going away for a week to a place where people are permitted, nay,  encouraged  to have sex with as many people as possible in any place they please...&nbsp;  (Pass me a drink please?&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my hands are tied up (literally), would you mind resting it on his ass?) &nbsp; On the other hand,&nbsp;I have my pride - you can't just disappear and then pop your fucking gorgeous head back in whenever you feel like it.&nbsp; Fine, you were absolutely the best lover I've had since coming to this godforsaken city (well, it was sort of a tie, actually, but&nbsp;he was a little more consistent than the competition) but I'm not sure when that factor started to matter less and less.&nbsp; Suddenly, being cheap, inattentive,&nbsp;controlling, judgemental&nbsp;and selfish started to be a bigger influence than the almighty cock.&nbsp;  &nbsp; And then&nbsp;there's Ivan.&nbsp; Good looking, successful, funny...&nbsp; but then again, I've only seen him once, and my judgement can be somewhat untrustworthy.&nbsp; He is already showing signs of "man issues" and I'm not really wanting to be anyone's therapist at this point.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I'm pretty sure than any man who dates me is going to have issues with my vacation.&nbsp; After all, it would take a mighty secure man to wish me "bon voyage" for a trip to Hedonism.&nbsp; Secure, or Insane.&nbsp; I actually think I'm asking more than I could give at this point. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      I occasionally feel as though my life is actually some big farce.&nbsp; As if I am the butt of a joke, or the subject of some complex (and long term) experiment.&nbsp; This has only gotten worse since I moved to this city, and last weekend was certainly no exception.  &nbsp;  On Friday night, I arranged to meet my friend Marcie at a local Irish pub.&nbsp; She has been overseas for a few months and we had a fair bit of catching up to do.&nbsp; Now - since this blog is new I should preface the following story a bit...&nbsp; I have made very few close friends since "the big move" and my standards have, as a result, dropped significantly.&nbsp; The girlfriends that I have made here would be put to shame by&nbsp;my relationships in Toronto.&nbsp; That being said, please don't fault me for having less than perfect friends out here.&nbsp; Sometimes, they downright suck.&nbsp; I am working to improve this, I promise.. and will keep posting my progress in this area.&nbsp; I could also use some serious improvement in the dating department, but that's another story.  &nbsp;  Back to Marcie.&nbsp; We meet at a bar, and she is alone.&nbsp; I mention this, because I was expecting to see her on a "date" of sorts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Someone she had been chatting with online, and was supposed to be meeting a couple of hours before I arrived.&nbsp; I soon learned that she had been stood up..&nbsp; no problem, but maybe I should have known that this would set the tone for the evening.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  An hour, a few glasses of vino, and some seriously entertaining stories later....&nbsp; I am getting the distinct feeling that she's missed me a bit TOO much.&nbsp; A crush?&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; Not a big deal, I am cute...&nbsp; but really not my thing.&nbsp; Anyhow, this quickly escalates and soon Marcie is freaking out because she came back from the washroom and found me talking to a guy at the bar.&nbsp; The nerve of me...&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyhow- another pint, some serious&nbsp;bar-therapy,&nbsp;and we've got ourselves a truce.&nbsp; Thank god.&nbsp; I just don't know how men DATE women like this.&nbsp; Damn.&nbsp; The best part though, is that about 45 mins later, she announces that she's leaving...&nbsp;&nbsp; with a&nbsp; short cocky Australian man (boy?) that she met moments before.&nbsp; Wished her the best of luck, and moved on to some&nbsp;better times on my own.&nbsp; The night was fabulous, although I had to cut myself off at one point and switch to water for the last couple of hours (that just never happens!!).&nbsp; You don't see many women at bars by themselves, but it's surprisingly livertating. ... (liberating?) &nbsp; Now comes the good part.&nbsp; The phone call the next day to see how Marcie's night with mr. shorty ended up.&nbsp; The story she told me was fucking incredible.&nbsp; The night before, before they started having sex, she had asked him to put on a condom.&nbsp; He had obliged, but once things were in full swing, asked her where she wanted him to cum.&nbsp; She was a bit confused (I would have suggested the eye, maybe a bit in the hair, rubbed in for effect) and told him to cum in the condom.&nbsp; At that point, he seemed confused - "oh, i took that off awhile ago" he tells her.&nbsp; She FREAKS out (men, please, for future reference, this is a serious deal breaker) and tells him to get the fuck out. &nbsp; Now, up to this point, I'm on board.&nbsp; Totally agree with her, this is absolutely horrible... 2004 and you don't care about the risks of unprotected sex.&nbsp; May I suggest that the people who don't care (um, mr. short stuff) already have something.&nbsp; A blatant disregard for their own health almost indicates a bigger risk, in my opinion. &nbsp; Anyhow, moving along... then she tells me that when he left IN THE MORNING that he seemed surprised that she wouldn't kiss him on the mouth.&nbsp; Who are you, Pretty Woman??&nbsp; Well, I say to her, does that mean that you let him stay afterall.&nbsp; A simple hum, haw, and inevitable silence gave me my answer.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Moron. &nbsp; Marcie spent Sunday at the clinic being tested.&nbsp; I let her know that she was a bit early for true results, but I guess there was some concern from her trip overseas as well. &nbsp; Seriously people, I am the biggest advocate of casual sex, monogamous sex, and even rough dirty sex with strangers in the bathroom of your favorite nightclub, if that's what does it for you.&nbsp; But for the love of christ, can we start protecting ourselves??&nbsp; It's bloody 2004.

      Who knew I would be here?&nbsp; Being that my first introduction to the world of blogging was a slightly offensive one....&nbsp; my name spashed all over someone's blog in living colour.. I am shocked and bewildered that I have succumed to the need to publicly post the events of my life.  &nbsp; Whether or not they are interesting.... time will tell. &nbsp; For now, a few ground rules: &nbsp; 1.&nbsp; No real names, ever. 2.&nbsp; No real places, ever. 3.&nbsp; I reserve the right to change or add rules at any time.&nbsp;  4.&nbsp; I welcome comments, but be gentle, I'm somewhat fragile.&nbsp; Oh, and I fight back. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Mouths, tongues, hands, skin.  The anticipation is almost better than the act itself.  Thrown on the kitchen counter, arms around his neck, he pulls me into him and I gasp.  It was a nice way to say goodbye.

      it has just hit me that in a matter of a few short months i will have been single for a year. if you don't count the 3 week attempt at desperate reconcilliation with JT last January, of course.   this is just about the time where i start to feel ready for another try with some new mr. wonderful.  yet i don't.  need i wait till it has officially been a year?  i've finally grown weary of one night stands (for the most part) so i suppose that's progress.  however, what does my "thing" with Craig constitute?  i know for certain that it's got the shelf life of a tomato.  i turned down lunch with him today (to be honest, i was simply scared that i would have to pay for it) and might see him tomorrow night, or not at all before i leave on saturday.  i'm scheduled for a wax, and then to see mr. kellogg tomorrow, but might postpone.  afterall, we met a couple of weeks ago, and he has called me only twice.  there doesn't seem to be any urgency on his part, so i think things can wait a couple more weeks.   why do i feel that any time i spend with craig before i go will be the last i see of him?  something tells me that once i return... energized and feeling more like myself, i will be less and less tolerant of his bullshit.  but then, hasn't that been what he's asked for all along?

      I don't know any better way to do this than to list by chronological order... so here goes:  Friday:  went on a series of "blind"dates.  The first, I've already discussed, and really deserves no more attention.  The second was with a guy who was just gross.  Unshaven and smelly...  with a significant whitehead that I feared might burst and ruin my wine.  He had a youthful (read: naive) quality about him, which made me reluctant to just be honest with my first impression.  I sat through one glass of wine, even though I'm "off" the sauce it was needed for this encounter.  We discussed books mostly.  He's a computer programmer who works long hours and doesn't date much.  He said almost nothing for about an hour.  I asked him if he wanted to leave.. told him that if it wasn't clicking for him I wouldn't be offended, then sat back and hoped for my out.  We got the bill (he paid, thank god -  my housemate says that when I asked the universe for someone who wasn't cheap I should have been more specific about the other details) and left.  He walked with his bicycle to my car.  At that point, he started stammering, and some nonsense came out of his mouth about kissing me.  I think it went something like "i really like affection, and haven't kissed anyone for a long time.  I would like to kiss you".  I thanked him for sharing that thought with me and left.   Not wanting the night to be a total waste (it was barely 9 pm), I took a call from a certain cute man, who I have been chatting with for a few months but had never met.  I agreed to meet him and his friend at a small lounge downtown.  This time, I wasn't disappointed with his looks.. but his personality needed some serious renovations.  Bigoted, small minded and scared of his own shadow...  for christ sake, it was GAY PRIDE and he chose a place in the WEST END but yet became very uncomfortable when men were looking at him.  He actually asked me to chug the remainder of a glass of wine (half full or half empty?) and wouldn't even continue our conversation until we left.  Once I was outside, I excused myself for the evening and picked up a small package of two bite brownies.  Admittedly a failed evening all around, I went home.   Saturday was a much needed improvement.  I went to the beach with a new girlfriend and lay around talking about nothing and catching some sun (prep work for the upcoming vacation).  Later that evening, I met up with Ivan for dinner.  It was excellent, and a drastic change from our last meeting.  He is so kind and has such a good heart.  He seems smitten, telling me that he even showed his mother my online profile... you never know how shy you truly are until you experience a moment like this.  How can something like this make me feel so self conscious?  He spent the night at my place, but once again there was no "action" to be had.  I don't know why, but I am never sexually attracted to the nice ones, at least not at first.  They seem to lack a certain passion or enthusiasm that the bad boys exude.  Or maybe it's a protective instinct on my part....  who knows?   Sunday was the Gay Pride Parade, and I set out early to meet a couple of groups of friends.  This was by far the highlite of my weekend.  The parade, although nothing compared to T.O., was so much fun!  At one point, one of my housemates (who was in the parade with her lesbian softball league) saw me and I flashed her for a CD.  She looked shocked.  I may have had the same look.  Afterwards, we went to a few different places, got a little blitzed, and I was home before midnite.  I was told repeatedly that I look like some chick from The Avengers (Emma Peel - is that right?)  which is always a treat for the ego.  At the next club, I got a guy's number...  from a man who pronounced himself straight (the line is so thin these days) and specifically mentioned that he does not want to have sex.  Just drinks.  Or even if I just call to be put on the list...  whatever.  Now that's what I call no pressure.  Despite frequent urges to kiss strangers, I was marvellously well behaved.   Monday was a holiday, and although Craig extended such a tempting invitation to spend a glorious, sunny day running his errands, I decided to decline and head to the beach.  He came over later and the sex was predictably phenomenal.  Wait, that word just never covers it.  I can't explain in words how fucking amazing this man is in bed.  When I decide to end it (I will, it's inevitable)  I promise to pass out his contact info, in case anyone is interested.  I just can't believe that two people who have so much chemistry in bed can have such a mental disconnect.  He told me that it frustrates him when I am tolerant.  Annoys him that my open nature goes against his "value system".  I asked him if he was aware that he wouldn't be in my bed if I weren't so tolerant of him.  He said that he knows.  I explained that it's a package deal and he needs to start showing some respect or I'm gone....  but seriously, who am I kidding??  I'm not into one night stands these days....  and I'm not sleeping with anyone else... and everyone else that I have slept with out here has been a bit of a disappointment.  So, leaving isn't that simple.  Maybe I just have to transition it to a more strictly casual sexual relationship.  Cut all the fluff.  I mean, it's not like he's courting me now anyway...  and just fuck his brains out.  I'm going to stop now.  Getting turned on just thinking about it.  Dammit, how does he do that to me?  It's now Tuesday.  Work, work, work... then another blind date tonight.  Needing a bit of luck for this as I'm already feeling jaded.
