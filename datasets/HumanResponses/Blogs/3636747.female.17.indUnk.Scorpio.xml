      "I need to leave. I need to get out and get away and just abandon all sense of the now. I envision myself just quietly leaving in the middle of the night and moving away...and not in some purile and juvenile attempt to illicit worry and concern from friends and family, but just to be able to move on with no hassle and no ties to bind me. See....this is what happens when I don;t have anything to keep my mind focused...other than the trials."

      In the middle   do u know how hard it is to be the person in the middle? its so hard to please both sides and still remain sane. it kinda tears u up inside too especially if its got 2 do with friends n they're fighting. u dont purposly take sides but it sometimes happens ... sometimes u cant even talk to one of them cause the other person will think ur betrayin them or something like that ... n when ur with them n its just the 3 of u ... its extreamly hard then cause u cant leave them alone together or talk to one person in particular or the other one feels rejected ... and being a libra im said to sit on the fence a lot ... its in my nature ... if u believe in all dat stuff ...   posted by ~annie~ @ 12:31 AM  1 comments   Friday, June 25, 2004  ==:: everytime i read this...i dunno...keep mulling over and over the words...line by line...word by word...i'm talking to her her now ::==  talk later. have so many things on my mind right now. i cant describe evrything. i need to find some sort of words because i think...everything will come out wrong if i try and say it right now...my thoughts are a fusion of incongruous feelings and images that conjure up memories that...are indescript.   k later. luv...me.

      If ever you need me, I’ll come running.. You wont need to ask me twice, by your side I will remain.. But when your ok and things get going, I’ll be off…I’ll be going.  I cannot give to you unconditionally  I cannot let go Not yet can I tell u I’m sorry, Nor that I forgive you. Our Friendship is like dust, Something you  just blow away.  You have awakened me to a new understanding, By no means give everything, You will only get hurt. And with your passing whisper of this wisdom, Have reckoned in me a hurt exceedingly deep.    -- for those people...  life with you is...hurtful.

      For the people i love most!!  "If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day, Well I'm sure you'll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away.  For surely there's always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance to make everything just right.  There will always be another day to say "I love you," And certainly there's another chance to say "Anything I can do?"  But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I'd like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget"  -- for all those people in my life who I will never forget…you all know who you are…you are special to me…you are close to me in ways you won’t ever know…you have influenced me and shaped me into part of what I am today, and for that I thank you…life wit u makes it a beautiful life…I love u guys!

I want to cry and I need to hold on… The way I feel about you must never be discounted… In this existence or the last…however many there are to come…. I will be devoted to you for life… You will never be alone…"  okay. i'l start a new post..for da ppl in me life..brb..  muahz.. ChrIiZz..

      Like any other kind of love, friendship can be lost within our lives due to neglect or anger or, sometimes, simply circumstances. However it is lost, we often lose a part of ourselves that can never quite be recovered.  The following poem is an excerpt from a poem by Dan McDonald. I guess i dont really know how to put the current situation into any words...this poem is the best way do describe certain aspects of just what's happening between us (between my girlz n fellaz). I dont know. Feel angry. lost. very very sad. but most of all just confused - it never ceases to amaze me how things can unfold into the worst situation..so here it is:    Betrayal by Dan McDonald

      Isnt it funni how someone can touch your heart? it's amazing how special a bond you can create with someone..only to have it severed and by yourself...that really hurts...i heard this song today in my mums car on the way home from my exam and i felt like crying because it reminded me of some things and it hurt. especially coz dis is a special song that was 'given' to me by someone. well what can you do? just learn to cope with it huh?.... B2K - the reason why i love you   From day one you and I've been friends.   Hangin out, havin fun, chillin.   Now I know at times I got crazy, silly ways and actin shady.   You peep things in me that no one sees.   Now I have friends I thought were true but no one more true than you.   So what am I gonna do?   It took a while for me to see how special you treated me.....      No other girl is quite like you.And no one has my back like you do.      Maybe thats the reason why I love you.   You're my heart girl.   And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here...      it took a while for me to see how special you treated me....   xo. Chriz.
