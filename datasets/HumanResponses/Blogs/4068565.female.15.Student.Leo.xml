      Well I have decided to stay away from the internet for awhile. Just my blog...and MSN. I'll still be on AIM...n stuff...I just need a break from somethings. I need to take a break n stuff...not from everyone tho...I'll always be glad to talk to Arik...and some other people...I just realize now that I need sometime away from it all. So I don't have to worry about stuff...Mert and Evie helped me a lot today and Im so glad I have such great people like that to talk to. They are such great people. I love them ta death and they do so much for me. I spent about and hour and a half talking with them today and afterwards I felt really good. So yeah...thats about it for now...I'll write again when I decide I want to come back..But I need a break...a good vacation. Later all.  I love you Arik!!!  -Tara

      Well I just got home from band a little bit ago and let me tell you...I hate it already. It was soo cold out and we marched for almost an hour...and I made the mistake of wearing flip flops. And the circles...suck! Yeah...so we marched and went through the music and thats about it. We get to do the same tomorrow night. Its crazy how small our band is now. I didnt realize how many seniors we had last year. And after this year...its gonna mainly be my class cuz theres not to many Juniors. Crazy stuff...So yeah today I didnt do to much...my day went by tho. Went to church for awhile...messed around...hung with Jon for awhile...and yeah thats about it. Tomorrow I get to clean the house and go and talk to Evie about some stuff. And then it'll be Friday! Yay! So I probably wont write till Monday or w/e...Im sooo excited...and sooo happy! :-D I love you Arik! Can't wait to see you!!!  -Tara

      Wow...this summer was the craziest summer ever...yet another family member in the hospital. It all started with my Grandma...last May she had eye surgery because she had a hole in her eye. Then June my Grandpa had his kidney out because it was cancerous. They thought that was the only place he had it in his body but they were sure wrong. Hes had brain cancer for atleast 3 months now. Thats what caused the kidney and the bone. They just didnt know about it till now. *sigh* So he has 9 more radiation treatments...and hopefully that will do it. Now they are getting my Grandma a hearing aid because she really needs to hear him and she wasnt to happy about it but shes going along with it and then yesterday my aunt Phyllis had really bad pain and she was getting some drugs but the pain got so bad they rushed her to the ER where they found out that she needed her gall bladder out. *sigh* So she had that surgery today. Wow. Tho theres been some good news through out this summer....bad and good. Ive gone through this emotional rollercoaster. Its crazy. Up, Down, Up, Down, Up Up Up Up, Down, Up. Heh. My mom is sooo happy I have Arik. Otherwise Id be a wreck. Hes helped me more than he probably knows. I could talk to him and he made me smile even if I was pouring out tears. *sigh* Life is so crazy. But from now on...I really am going to live everyday as my last. I know now that I should do that. Don't live in the past...live today. And that way..I dont think I'll be depressed...being happy is the best. I feel soo wonderful now. I'm having the time of my life. And its all good. No regrets. I also found out from the school that I get my own locker. YES! no more...someone. I saw that someone today...she smiled and tried to be nice...I was like...yeah...whatever. Kim named her something else to...bad name haha. Asslick lol...Yeah....anyways. Life is good..and I can't wait till Friday! It'll be great to see Arik again. I miss him so much. *sigh* Well today is my Grandpas 74th birthday so the whole family except my aunt whos in the hospital will go out to eat. So yeah...I just really hope he gets better soon. Life is looking up at the moment...life is good.  -Tara

      Well not much has been going on here...Yesterday I woke up around 11..mom was already at the hospital so I sat around doing nothing. Around 2 mom came home saying Grandpa was home and it was all good. We washed the car and I got to scrub the inside...Its weird how my parents do extra cleaning when people come...Never cleaned the car tho...Arik you are special. LoL So...we did that...Had the first family supper all week...First time mom was home all week...I swear. Then we went over and saw my Grandpa. He looked really good...Gave him a big hug and it was good cuz he was smiling and everything. Im glad he wasnt as bad as he was last week. Then we came home and I sat around...talked to Arik for the longest time. Then went to bed. Woke up late today. Im soo drained...I think all this stress came on now...and I needed sleep. So I missed church..and didnt clean the library...I was so extreamly tired. So I sat around till 3:15ish when Rich came and picked me up so I could babysit their grandchildren...Tanner (4)  and Garret (2). Cutest things ever! Garret was sooo cute. I wanted to take him home with me. I love kids. So we had a good time...played with trains and trucks...and all that fun stuff. Watched soo many train movies...wow. They were very obsessed with trains. It was a good time tho....sooooo cute. I want my little boy to be like Garret. So adorable...he said my name like Tawah. It was very cute. I had a great time with them...but by the end I was getting very tired....and Im still up...*sigh* I talked to Arik tonight...and he keeps saying hes not the perfect boyfriend....but he is. He has no idea...how perfect he is. *sigh* I love him sooo very much and thats never going to change......Well I really should head off to bed....watch I end up staying up till 2....Probably...anyways im out.  -Tara

      Its me again..just happier this time...good thing. *nod* Well today was pretty crappy...until bout 7...but here it goes. Mom got me up around 9 when she left for work...so I laid around until about 11 and decided I needed to get up and do stuff. So I did nothing for quite awhile...mom left for  the hospital around 12...and I sat here alone all day long. I went crazy...I watched the ending of my favorite movie...so I was bawling when the phone rang. It was Deb calling bout babysitting Sunday. Then I hang up and watch the rest of the movie and cry some more and than I got a call from my favorite person. It was good...but I ended up crying after he left. So I sat here some more...decided to do something half way constructive so I  worked on the dance and then colored. It was something to pass the time. So then dad came home and we ordered a pizza...round 7ish everything started looking up. Arik called and said he could come! I was sooo excited. And I really hoped my parents would say yes...then my mom got home around 8...I couldnt ask right away she was telling us more -good- news! My Grandpa looks the best he has in a long time...hes walking good and thinking better. Wow. Unbelievable how life can change so fast. So I walked up to my mom slowly with a huge smile on my face and asked her. She said....."I already said he could come..." yay! I think I flew...lol Im sooo excited and soo happy. Wow. I keep getting this wonderful feeling in my stomach....*sigh* Im so happy. Life treats you right sometimes doesnt it? Once again....life goes on...I got thru some ruff days...and await the good to come...*sigh* Can't wait! Well im out for the night....  Friday the 13th is good...not bad!  -Tara

      Okay...ive tried to be strong...but now I can't hold it any longer. I need to talk to Arik...so badly...I just realized I can't talk to anyone else about all of this...and I've been holding all the tears back...until now. I let them all fall. Okay I admit....I dont have the greatest life...I dont have that many friends...and most of the friends I have...I cant talk to. I've always been able to talk to Arik...and now...when I need him the most...I can't and...*sigh* I dunno...I just needed to write a little of this out...cuz...yeah...writing always helps me...  My mom said I couldn't even talk to her...shes under so much stress and can't handle mine also. I've always been able to talk to her bout everything....its weird...but we do talk. I think the only thing shes told me lately is that I need him...to talk to...Grandpa just get better...please...so we dont have to be under so much stress...and...I wont feel like this...dont worry Im not depressed...I  am staying far away from that....last winter was enough for me...Im not goin that far down again...I realize now....life goes on...and you dont need to die over something stupid...so im being strong in everyway that I can...but im a softie...and cry alot. I think im gonna go watch my all time favorite movie, Backdraft, now....so I can bawl at the end....and feel good about it...and if anyones willing to talk to me...or just listen...call me anytime day or night...i wont care. I need to talk to someone. Arik probably more than anyone...but still i wouldnt mind a phone call...  Heh. I feel like I sound all needy n crap. And needy can get annoying...ive learned from that....so yeah...its just that i needed to write what I felt...and I did....so yeah...sorry for anything /  everything. Blah. Someone gets angry about like everything I write so I don't even know why I do it....for my own good...yes thats it...for me. My feelings....my thoughts....my heart.  Im Out.  -Tara

      Well today and the many days ahead are going to be ruff...but as long as everything goes as planed...everything shall be alright. They said it...Grandpa has brain cancer. *sigh* Its been really hard around here lately...and theres only one person I can talk to...and I cant. Today I mainly sat around...here all alone...thinking about everything....about how lost I'd be....Kim came over for awhile...she cheered me up...but I still didnt have that same smile. I guess I can just keep counting the long days until Youth Council. I think its down to 37 days. *sigh* Everything is so crazy. My life. heh...what is normal anyway? This summer has not been the greatest...for anyone in my family. Grandma had a hole in her eye...she had surgery...then my Grandpa had his kidney out cuz it was cancerous...and one cell musta got lose...and its now in his brain. *sigh* I might even have to have surgery sometime within the next year...for my eye again. If I do...I want it at the end of the school year....so summer will be here and I wont have to worry bout all my school work and stuff. 2nd semester is going to be really hard...Im not gonna even try cheerleading then....I wouldnt be able to handle it....I don't know whats gonna happen even the first half...with family stuff...school and cheerleading. *sigh* I hope everything turns out okay. We started a prayer chain thru church today....mom didnt even go to work...and shes only going to go in for a little while tomorrow...and then shes gonna go back to the hospital...so I get to make supper again....only the 5th time this week. *sigh* Life is crazy isnt it? One minute everything can be great...like Tuesday night. All my plans...everything was good....Grandpa came home from the doctor and they said there was no cancer...that night was great...all smiles...no tears. Wednesday. Boom. I woke up to bad news...and I feel like Im hated. Then my Grandpa went downhil...and gosh. *sigh* I dunno what to do...Kim leaves tomorrow so Im really going to be alone....no one to talk to....no one I love atleast. Theres one person I need so much right now....cuz I need to talk and get helped through all of this....and I can't talk to that one person. *sigh* I guess I'll just sit here and...make it through. I just hope he gets through this....I just have to think positive....Cuz I know...my Grandma will be lost without him....Get better Grandpa....  -Tara    Song of the Day:  Perfect, Sara Evans  If you don't take me to Paris On a lover's getaway It's all right, it's all right If I'd rather wear your t-shirt Than a sexy negligee It's all right, it's all right Every dinner doesn't have to be candlelit It's kinda nice to know that it doesn't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly love can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for you It's good enough for me  If your mother doesn't like The way I treat her baby boy It's all right, it's all right If in every wedding picture My daddy looks annoyed It's all right, it's all right Don't you know that all the fairy tales tell a lie Real  love  and real life doesn't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly  Love  can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for you It's good enough for me  You don't mind if I show up late for everything And when you lose your cool it's kinda cute to me Ain't it nice to know that we don't have to be  Perfect Baby every little piece Of the puzzle doesn't always fit Perfectly  Love  can be rough around the edges tattered at the seams But honey if it's good enough for youIt's good enough for me

      I don't even know how to start this one. Today hasn't been the best day. First I find out that after all the good news of my Grandpa not having cancer last night...he had a bad fall and hit his head. Then this morning he was doing alright but around 12 or so he got all weak and didnt want to move. We got him to bed and when he woke up from his nap he thought my Grandma was my aunt Merna Rae. They took him over to the hospital in Spencer and my mom was there for a long time. She finally came home...crying. They took a head scan and the doctor thinks its something but my parents wont tell me what. All they said is that if it is...what they think...he has no chance. *sigh* Its horrible around here...nobody stops crying. Its really hard...I haven't lost a family member in a long time and I guess it feels like I have a closer relationship with my Grandpa Frick than any of the others we've lost. And remembering what my mom told me just this morning make me cry even more. I can't stop. I really need to talk to someone. I think im gonna go now...and call Arik. I love you Grandpa I hope you know that. I just wish you would get better. I love you.  -Tara

      Sorry bout my last entry...I needed to let things out...and I have a very strong feeling that Im not going to be down...for a very...Very...VERY long time. Arik makes me soo happy. *sigh* Its unbelievable...what he does to me. Just to hear him breathe....make me flutter inside. Ive never been so happy and so in love in my life. Arik is my world....without him Id be lost. Hes awesome...and Im soo very glad I have him. I thank God for him every night...And I love him soo very much. I don't think anything in life could measure up to what I feel for him. Im having the time of my life...being in love. Thank you Arik....I love you. And Im not going anywhere...I mean it.  -Tara

      Okay. Wow. I can't keep it in any longer. I need to vent. And I didn't feel like letting it out on anyone cuz yeah...they might get tired of it....I really wanted to talk to Arik...but he was busy...so this is all I have. The thought of dropping out of YC is starting to grow on me. I don't know how Im gonna be able to face all these people after what they are doing to me. Why do they even care about my life? Thats my question. If all they can think of to write/talk about is me...they really must not have a life. Some people -need- to grow up. God. I really mean it. Why can't they just leave me alone. Whats done is done. What I don't get...is why Im blamed for every God Damn Thing thats going on. "oh the reason we hate each other is your fault" Bullshit. Okay....you said you tried...I tried also...and I decided....You werent the person I wanted to be friends with. My mom wouldnt let me even if I wanted to. I can see right thru people. I know whos lying...whos true...and who to love. I can make my own decisions. Its just really getting to me now....life. Its really shitty. One thing is I'd never do is kill myself. Life can and will get better...but when you feel so bad you think it never will...but it will. I've learned that already. Life goes on. So why are so many people stuck in MY past? I wish people would just live their own life...and get off of my back. Cuz okay...I get hurt easily. And being trashed hurts. Im sorry Im strong...Im emotional...soft hearted. And I haven't had the best life I coulda. Back in elementary....I remember crying myself to sleep. Do you call that a life? It sucks when you are the main target of humor. Some "populars" think its real great to make fun of you and see you cry....but until the day it happens to them...they have no idea what it feels like. *sigh* Im really gonna lose it one of these days...I don't understand. Life. How would you feel if you had no real close friends...Welcome to my life. I thought I had some....But I just keep getting turned on more and more everyday. Im ready to give up. But I wont. I have Arik. All this talk about him not keeping promises....Im not listening to.  If he just wanted sex outta me theres plenty of people I know who would glady do it....but he really cares...and I love him. No one...not one person can change what I feel...no words....no actions....nothing. So those people who are trying to make my life a living hell...its kinda working. But im not gonna let it get to me as much...as long as I can write here without getting trashed....or blamed for shit I didnt do...I will let it out here only. If only some people would spend a day in my life. I have values....unlike some people. I just wish this would end. If it doesnt....I can gareentee....Lynne, Bob, and Evie are gonna want to have a big group talk....and that'll just be messed up. We're supposed to be a family at Youth Council, all get along, and I want that to happen...but aslong as some people keep acting childish I don't see it happening....I just want this to all be good before YC. If not I may not beable to go. I want to go...to have fun...and im there for a reason...not just cuz my friends and my boyfriend are in it...well supposedly my friends....some atleast I dunno if I can trust anymore. But yeah. God called me to do this. Some people are in it just because they can be with friends at this. IM there for a reason....and I don't want these people to ruin it for me. I think I need to talk to Lynne again. She really helps me....I may just e-mail her bout everything now. I may not. I just hope everything works out. I want it to. More than probably any of you think. I just wish we could all get along like we used to. Get over this mess...and go on with life. I guess Im speaking my mind here....because all my heart says is that I love Arik more than anything and it tells me to never leave him because hes wonderful and we were meant to be. I love you Arik...I really don't know where I'd be without you. Im so glad I can talk to you about all this....you make my world....even if its a little messed up....complete. I trust you...and believe your promises. I don't listen to everyone elses bullshit.  I love you Arik.  -Tara

      Me again...just extreamly sore this time. Wow. I didnt know I could be in so much pain from just a little cheerleading and dance. I guess I'll star t with last night tho. It was...bad. I was getting angry and emotional so I called Arik and everything was better...Can always count on him to make me smile. Hes so wonderful. So yeah that was a big interesting mess that I got myself out of. Anyways then today I got up around 8 and went out to the school for cheerleading. Ugh. I was soo extreamly tired...since I was up late talking to Arik and my mom. So we warmed up and I didn't have any breathing problems so I knew already that this year was better. We worked on some new cheers and did some stunts. We went over positions and jumps and then went to lunch. I walked over to Godfathers...yeah. Then walked back and sat around for awhile cuz no one else was back yet. Then we had cheer talk and then learned a dance. Im really bad at it now..its way to fast. Its to the song Yeah. Wow its fast. ugh. I will hopefully have it almost all down by tomorrow. Then we did more stunts and then got evaluated on a cheer and prep. It was a somewhat fun day I guess...Im just sooo sore. But that just means Im working...getting tight positions and all that. Plus I found out that someone droped Varsity so I might get to cheer some games. I don't know the exsact details to anything yet we'll figure it all out on the first day of school. So yeah...thats about all that went on today...tomorrow I'll be doing the same....just extra sore....my neck is the worst. I was counting on seeing Arik this Friday...but its not gonna work out. The 20th may tho....so then I can see him...and he can stay 3 whole days here...yay!  Anyways...Im gonna head off now....later all...  -Tara

      Well yesterday and today were very uneventful...but I'll ramble about it for the heck of it....  So yesterday I woke up to the phone ringing...it was Jon saying him and his family were gonna sit up by City Hall for the parade so I was like okay...I'll see ya up there. So I got up and ready and walked up there bout 20 till 10. I walked around looking everywhere and couldn't find anyone. I saw Jenna and Paige and walked with them for a few minutes then I spotted my Aunt Laura and went over to talk to her. She was going in and out of my Grandmas so I followed. Finally I saw the Filkins so Jon sat with my cousins and I at the parade. I got a handful or so of candy...it was soo exciting! ...right. Then said by to Jon and went inside my Grandmas to have lunch with the whole Hansen family. Then a family member took Rachel, Katie, and I for a ride in a 1931 chevorle (sp?) touring car. It was pretty neat. Then we decided to go on a walk around town and soon after we left we saw Lance...my stalker. It was scary! He followed us around and wouldnt say anything to us but just followed. Then we went to Grandmas to get rid of him but he walked right in after us. It was scary. Then we came down to my house to watch a movie and finally got rid of him....for 2 hours. At 5 Katie and Rachel went back to Grandmas and Kim came over to my house since I haven't seen her all week and then Lance came along too. So they sat back here and it was scary cuz he was acting all flirty n shit and he asked me out. I was like "HELL NO!" but I was nicer and said "Im sorry I have a boyfriend" *sigh* Thank God for Rachel and Katie. They called and asked if I wanted to go out to eat with them and Grandma at Petes. So we went and Lance left. When we got back he wasnt around Thank God...but he showed up at my house for a little bit. Round 9 Jon came here and we walked uptown to the dance. We decided we didn't know anyone so we left after bout 45 mins of it. We didn't even get in...we stood outside and talked to my cousin for awhile. Then we came back here and I was happy cuz Arik was home...so I talked to him for awhile...and then Lance arrived. I was scared...he came in and wouldnt leave. Finally he did....and I got to talk to Arik for another hour....so about midnight I hoped in the shower...blow dried my hair and went to bed around 1.  Today I had to get up early and be at the highschool at 8:30 for choir and bell practice. It sucked. I was sooo tired. And I couldn't find my parents anywhere. It was nerve racking! But it worked out alright. I played bells...messed up horribly...it was bad...sang in the choir....I was once again the only young person. Im used to it tho...Im the only highschooler in my church choir. So yeah church was alright. Then I looked for my mom afterwards and found out she fell back asleep and didn't get up in time for church....so we came back home and got ready for family pictures. Oh Joy! I really didn't like our outfits...my shirt was huge on me. I looked pregnant! I told everyone that too...eh. So around 1:30 we took pictures and then about 2 we had lunch at the Family Table. My mom, Rachel, Kate,  and I got tired of listening to the guys talk about stupid politics so we went outside and waited...finally we came home. I sat around doing nothing...calling Arik and random times. *sigh* I love hearing his voice...that much in one day. I called him 3 time and he called once. Its great. Im soo glad for phone cards! We both keep chanting...5 more days...*sigh* I can not wait to see him. We get to spend all day together...its gonna be great. Go swimming...shopping...other fun stuff...haha. I can't wait. Anyways so I just got home from cleaning the library a little bit ago...woohoo another 8 dollars...ha. Yeah...so thats the rest of my uneventful weekend....catch ya later.  -Tara

      I am once again trying this. Hopefully no one will leave bad comments or anything...just let me talk about my day....so anyways. Arik left today for something so I can't talk to him till Sunday...or tomorrow night...I dunno...depends on when/if I go to the dance...but today...I got up around 1...got online did basicly did nothing all day...round 5 I went over to Jons and we sat around till 6 and went uptown...decided there was nothing fun so we went out to Godfathers and had some pizza. Had a great time talking bout stuff...random stuff...and then my favorite person in the world came...Jeff. Dun...dun...dun...eh. He came over and was like "Jon...this your new lady?" Hes like "No." Eh...I hate Jeff...err...If I never woulda started it off bad with him way back when...he wouldnt have a problem with me...but whatever. So after that we came to my house so I could grab a sweatshirt...Ariks ofcourse...and he laughed at my big fat duck. It was soo funny. LoL The Wazzzup Duck...haha.  Then we walked back uptown and got rained on. We decided nothing to fun was going on so we walked back to his house and we sat around in his room somemore...talked bout stupid things...like these drawings he did..they were pretty cool tho. I laughed. He also gave me my b-day present which was a hello kitty pen. Its awesome! lol...fun stuff. Then we walked back to my house and then out to the fireworks...watched them...and both stated we wished Kait and Arik were there with us. The finally was pretty good actually. I think its the first time Hartley has actually had fireworks in a long time. It was amusing...then we walked back here and attempted to figure out how we were gonna meet tomorrow for the parade...and then he walked home. So I came in and decided I wanted a new blog...since I deleted the old one...and no one is on to talk to ...and my parents are uptown probably getting drunk...so Im home alone...I knew this was gonna happen....me alone this weekend. *sigh* If only Arik coulda come...I remember months ago I was looking forward to this weekend....HA....I actually thought it was gonna be fun....whatever. Im havin fun with Jon tho...so its all good. Only a week till I see Arik...*hopes* Jon and I talked bout it tonight...he might be able to go...but who knows...I want to go sooo badly! We'll see I guess....But I got this really sexy fun shirt yesterday shopping with Tracy and I wanna wear it...but he also asked me to the homecomming dance at his school this year...and if I can go to that...I'd wear that shirt...cuz its soo fun! Thanks Tracy for talking me into buying it. Its great fun. So yeah...I guess I have nothing else to say....later kids....  -Tara
