      I am at my dad's apartment with nothing to do but watch re-runs of Star Trek: the Next Geration. So I'm going to go to that now.  Does anyone even read this blog?  Mark

      Ok, so the blog didn't start of the way I thought it would. The damn Work Nazis at school kept us slaveing away like manics. And for what? A stupid number on a piece of paper. That just burns my toast, you know what I mean?  So now I'm going to do what I was going to do. This a story that I wrote when I was 12ish. I don't really remeber, truth be told. It will give you a slight idea what my stories started off like.  The Magic Pig 	 	One day, a few years ago, there was a poor farmer with only a little plot of land and a pig. There was a famine in the land, so the farmer's marajuna crop wasn't doing too well. 	The police soon came and arrested the farmer for growing an illegel crop. The farmer asked when he would be let out of jail. 	"When pigs fly I expect," said the cop. The farmer then thought of a way to excape the unearthly sentence. 	"Can I have your word on that," ask the farmer. The cop seeing no harm in the idea replied, "Sure, but make it quick."  	So the farmer ran out to the pig pen and brought his pig into the front yard. 	"Fly pig," commanded the farmer. The pig didn't move. 	"Fly pig," said the farmer though gridded teeth. The pig didn't seem to mind much and started to chew on some weeds. 	"Fly you freakn' pig, fly!" yelled the farmer. Then the pig did somthing most unexpected. The pig got up on his hind legs, walked straight up to the farmer and said straight to his face, " I'm a pig, not a bird. Get it straight." 	The cops were so stunned at the talking pig, that they didn't see the farmer making his escape. The farmer wasn't seen for 5 years, and was found at a pot party smoking weed and was sentence for 10 years in jail.  Yep, that's the magic pig for you folks out in cyberland with nothing to do but read random peoples blogs. I pity you with all my heart.  Speaking of heart, I had to go to the doctor today. Don't worry, I'm fine. But the whole story is kinda funny, well, not really, but I'll tell you all anyway.   My chest hurt whenever I breathed today. And the pain was in the left side of my chest, around my heart. I have had this pain on occation for awhile now, but it was getting pretty annoying by the time I was on to second period. I was talking to my best friend Olay after class and we completely forgot the time and before we knew it we were late to class. This was more a problem for me since my teacher one pet peeve was lateness and would have given me a detention had I walked into her class several minutes late without a pass. Olay suggested that I go to the nurses office and fake a headache, take a few asprin and leave with a pass back to class, thus saving  me from a dentention and the frist few minutes of my next class :) This was a amazingly good plan and I am greatly indebted to her for thinking it up.  Insead of complaining about a headache, I decieded to be somewhat honest and tell the nurse about the pain in my chest. The nurse got very nervous when I pointed to where the pain was and quickly sat me down and started to take my blood pressure and check my pulse. She then insisted on calling my mother and telling her about my chest pains. I went along with everything, even drawing things out longer than nessacary just so that I wouldn't have to go back to class. Eventually I left the nurse's office with a tylenol, a offer to leave school whenever I wanted, and a doctor's appointment at 4.  The rest of the day passed as did the pain and when I got the doctor's I reliezed I had absolutly no idea why I should be there. The doctor told me that what I had was called plural catch. It's when a piece of lung gets stuck inbetween the rib cage. He even provided useful illustrations of how this would happen, which was very nice of him. As it turns out that sort of thing happens to a lot of adolecent girls. Usually during a growth sprut.  That was a more pointless story then the one with the doped up famer and the talking pig. Sorry about that folks. If your still with me, you are all sicker than I thought you were.  Good night everybody! Until next time, this is Mark, the Unfortuantaly Name Female!

      Hello and welcome to my blog. I, Mark the unfortunatly named, welcome you with open arms. I hope dearly that we may all become good friends in due time.  Enough with the happy hippy shit.  This is how this blog is going to go. I am going to post amazing and awe-inspiring writings and such and you are going to read and like 'em. They will be wonderful, good and wholesome, don't you worry about that. Best of all, you will get to read my horribly morbid children tales. I have always been throughly annoyed with the stupid and predicable happy endings that children stories seem to always have. Since the young age for 8 or so I have been writing seemingly run-of-the-mill short stories that end horribly morbid. I doubt that I will have to force you to read them.  The fun will offically start tomorrow. Be ready for it.  Mark

      Okay, for some strange odd reason, myself and my friend Olay cannot get onto this blog. So this post is a despreat attempt for us to activate the blog. Nothing truly important is going on in this post so you can completely ignore it. I personally don't care.  Mark

      My friend Kelly has been kind enough to give a few of her ideas for the list since no one else has said anything.  General Cluster- the general at Big Horn. How dumb are you to piss off a bunch of native americans with rifles better than yours?  Edgar Allen Poe- this guy rocked. I personally love him to death. BUT YOU DO NOT MARRY YOUR COUSIN! THAT IS JUST EW!  Thank you, come again

      Sometime in the near or distant future time machine will be developed and I, for one, want to be prepared. The past is full of despicable and evil people that deserve a good slapping. All of known history is full of these people. And once the time machines become available problems such as this will be able to be rectified. Therefore I am making this list that will record all the people that I, when the opportunity arises, will want to give a good hard slap.  King David- this dude is just fucked up. That whole Bathseba thing was just nasty, not to mention wrong. He ended up losing several kids that way. And what the hell are you going to do with that many wives and concubines? Bloody prick.  Abaslom- this kid was worse than his father, Davie-boy. He got all of King David’s wives and concubines and fucked them all in brood daylight with everybody around and about. He was a nasty kid and eventually died a gnarly death, but what can a little slap hurt?  Hitler- One word- Holocaust. Need I say more? Yes, I realize that even with the beauty of time travel I may not get close enough to him to lay a finger on him without getting thrown in some concentration camp, but bare with me here. This guy needed some serious slapping, you have to admit that.  Stalin- the guy is to admired for his faith in communism, but when it’s killing billions of people, you need to give it up. He had a slap coming at him for a long time.  Queen Mary Tutor- she killed thousands of people just because they didn’t like her religion. What more do you need for a decent slapping?  King Henry VIII- I seriously had second thoughts on this one. What person who had five wives, started his own religion for his own convenience, and was incredibly sexist is not somewhat amusing. But for all those reasons and more, he’s got to be slapped. Not to mention that weight problem. Don’t tell me they didn’t have dietitians back then.  Adam and Eve- the whole reason we are in this rut. Every person one this planet wants a piece of those two.  Pol Pot- dude, this guy was evil. The Khmer Rouge is up there with the Nazis. Why would genocide be a good idea in any scenario? I guess you have to be psycho for that one to make sense. If anyone is getting a slapping, this guy is getting one.  Those were some of the obvious ones. Now I want some of you people to tell me who deserves to be slapped and why.  somethingmorbid88@yahoo.com  don't be shy and don't send anything nasty.  Mark, the slapper of bad people

      Prom was on Friday night. And I was stuck watching the worst TV programs I had ever seen in my life. Since I am but a measely sophmore, they would not allow me to go to the prom without a Junior or senior date. None of my older friends asked me and I didn't get to go. Diana liked it and I haven't heard from anyone else. Oh well. The drearyness of being a semi-unpopular teen.   But I'm not bitter. No, not at all.  but still,... *sigh*  All purpose mark

      Okay, I have a very amusing creative writing class. And there are many a story about that class.   One of which involves a conversation between me and Carrie. I was telling her about when I was in seventh grade my mother got one of my warts removed thru means of liquid Nitrogen. A lot of blood collected under that pact of skin till there was an inch high bubble on my finger. Me, being the werid person I am, liked to chew on this bubble because of its enjoyable resilence.   One day, the last period of the day, I was sitting in study hall, absent-mindedly chewing away on my bubble when suddenly some lukewarm metallic tasted liquid burst in my mouth. I cupped my hands as the blood from my bubble flowed out and pooled into my hands. I had no idea what to do. Here I was, in the middle of study hall with a pool of blood in my hands. It's not exactly something that happens everyday.  Now, what I actually did really isn't that interesting. I sat very quite for the rest of the class except for when I tried to wipe my hands off on a piece of paper. That didn't work very well. Once the bell rang I ran over to the nearest bathroom and throughly washed my hands. However I still was sitting in a public area with my hands full with blood. That notion is amusing in of itself.  So me and Carrie got to talking about my missed oppertunities to be really freaky. We came up with many scenarios, some of which I will now share with you...  Say to who ever sees the blood, "I just couldn't take it any more. They were driving me crazy."  or  "The bodies were like that when i got there."  or "you know that really annoying kid in our history class that you hate so much? Well, I did you a little favor, if you know what I mean..."  or the plain and simple "Opps."  There was also a few running out into the hall and screaming scenarios.  Run out into the hall and scream "I did it, I finally did it. They thought was was to chicken, but I sure showed them!"  or "I love the smell of fresh blood in the morning!"  or just laughing manically. That one is all-purpose.  Then I got to thinking, some of you all might want to contribute to our little disscussion. You got a good idea, let's hear it. somethingmorbid88@yahoo.com. And remember, nothing nasty.

      Here something humorus for you all in cyberland. I was in my creative writing class and my friends Lily Diana and Carrie were talking about this one girl that submitted poetry to the literary magizine they worked on. They refused to publish it and the girl thought it was because it was to morbid. We'll let you all decide.  I am a Vampire I like to drink blood  grrr. I am a creature of the night fear me, you mortal...  It just goes down hill from there.  What I think I'm trying to say is that your beautiful works of art that you worked ever so hard on can still be shit. You have to listen to what all those critics are saying or else you end up like this girl here.  morbid enough for you? Mark

      My school had an art show yesterday and I had promised my one friend who had artwork in it that I would go. The art show itself was set up in the lobby and at 7:30 there was a choir concert. I had also promised a friend that I would sit with him since he couldn't find anyone else. All and all it was a wonderful evening. The art show was amazing. The pure talent of some of these kids is awe-inspiring. And the choir concert was quite nice two. I'm afraid that I might have ruined it for mike but constantly commentarying, but that's what I do at these sorts of things.   One girl that sang an entire song was especially good. I know her personally and she is exactly to sort of person that you could hate to the core of your being with an undieing passion if she wasn't the sweetest thing you've ever met. She amazingly pretty, smart, funny, popular, talented, and now she's one of the best singers I have heard in a good long time. Man I wish I could be like that.  I have just finished reading Madame Bovary. I liked it a lot but not so much that I would continue to explore french literature. The french culture is notoriously depressing and heavy. Nothing that I need at this time of my life. Madame Bovary wasn't bad at all, in fact, compared to Julius Caeser which I read earlier this year it was straight up cheerful. If I was to ever meet Emma, the main character of the book, I would have to slap her. She had such high expectations for life and love that she could not be satisfied. She would suddenly get an idea in her head and she would follow it passionitly until she reliezed that this wasn't all that there was to life. Then she would drop it like yesterday's potatoes. The novel itself was beatifully written. The translation I read was very poetic and lovely. I believe it was done my Milard. Oh well, that doesn't matter.  As a change of pace I have started to read Catch-22. My english teacher highly suggested it. So far I enjoy it and look forward to continuing.  I get a lot of shit for picking my reading material from the engligh teacher's shelves, but the books are worth it.  Mark

My brother is here. Ben. He just got divorced. It only took a year. That's pretty good, right?  Yeah.   So, I'm going to go now....

      My last entry was much to emo. I was very tired and downtrodden when I wrote it. I must me happier in the future.   Well, there is another story you call can hear about. I warn you, this one is from the daily life of Mark herself. It involves a boy. A very nice boy. That I like quite a bit.   and so does my best friend Olay.  H o l y....SHIT!  Yah. So. That sucks.   But we both talked it over and were very mature about the whole thing. We decided that since the boy in question is to shy to ask either of us out, if he even liked one of us, that we would not let this come between our friendship. Olay was pushing me to accept such an offer if it was given, but I feel as though it is my friendly-duty to reject. That is, of course, provided he asked me. Olay has told me that she would do just that if he were to ask her and I should do the same.  But if he were to ask her and she were to decline, I would feel guilty for stopping what might have been.   And if he were to ask me....  uh oh.   mark out

      Wandering aimlessly online I stumbled across this poem. It is very beautiful and I like it but I am having troble figureing out what it means. Read it and send you interpritation to me at somethingmorbid88@yahoo.com  Touchstone, The  by William Allingham   A man there came, whence none could tell,  Bearing a Touchstone in his hand;  And tested all things in the land  By its unerring spell.   Quick birth of transmutation smote  The fair to foul, the foul to fair;  Purple nor ermine did he spare,  Nor scorn the dusty coat.   Of heirloom jewels, prized so much,  Were many changed to chips and clods,  And even statues of the Gods  Crumbled beneath its touch.   Then angrily the people cried,  "The loss outweighs the profit far;  Our goods suffice us as they are  We will not have then tried."   And since they could not so prevail  To check this unrelenting guest,  They seized him, saying - "Let him test  How real it is, our jail!"   But, though they slew him with the sword,  And in a fire his Touchstone burn'd,  Its doings could not be o'erturned,  Its undoings restored.   And when to stop all future harm,  They strew'd its ashes on the breeze;  They little guess'd each grain of these  Convey'd the perfect charm.   North, south, in rings and amulets,  Throughout the crowded world 'tis borne;  Which, as a fashion long outworn,  In ancient mind forgets.

      My aunt and I were planning to visit each other in DC. It was a pain in the ass to get all the plans together and several people started screaming at each other. The day before it all happened my aunt's boss finds out she wants to leave tomorrow and they won't let her because some guy is coming in and they want everthing done by the end of the week. So, that was a waste. But a relief at the same time. Everything was getting a bit much. Vacations can be so stressful.  My mother, a friend Bill, and myself went to French creek for a picnic. The food was good, escpecially my mother's potatoe salad. My mum then gave me a handfull of pretzels as desert. I don't like pretzels very much and found an oppurtunity to get rid of them. A goose family. I crumbled up three pretzels and threw it at them. They seemed to like it so I gave them more. Eventually there where over twenty geese eating these pretzels. Now, I really don't mind geese to much. But when there are twenty geese surrounding you and your family, hissing sharply for more food, you get a little freaked out. It was like that one Alfred Hitchcook movie "The Birds". My friend Bill thought it would be cool to have them eat out of his hand. So he got some bread and tried it. The geese seemed to like his fingers more than the bread. The hissing and the inconsistant "ow"'s became a constant background noise. I got very frightened at the hissing and continuous nipping. So I did what any somewhat rational person would do in the situation. I ran. And I refused to come back for 10 minutes when all the 20-some geese where gone.   There more to the story. It has to do with fishing, Irish men, and hot dog meat, but I don't feel like it right now.  Mark

      I want to write an essay. I have this great idea for one. And I wrote a killer opening paragraph. It was great! But I was writing it in church and my one friend that I was sitting with wanted to chit chat with me and I wasn't able to finish it. It's a great idea, i swear it. Just the thought of it is really intelligent. But I don't know what I'm going to do with it once I write it. It's a mean idea. I don't think it is but I know others will. I write it with no ill-will to anyone. I write for my own benefit but I want to share my ideas and writings with others. So I'm going to write it, when I get the inspiration again, and post it one here.  Wow that was a worthless blog. The entire thing is just me rambling on about some essay I want to write. I didn't even say what the damn thing was about. Sorry about that folks.   Church was o.k. Nothing special. Amy, my youth leader, gave me christian fiction book about Noah's wife's mother and she wants me to read by the end of the week. Yah right. My Mum just gave me two books that she wants me to read so that I can see what the authors do with annoying characters. One is about this super ditsy pre-teen that, if I knew her in really life, i would hunt her down and murder her in her sleep. Or maybe while she was awake and aware of her surrondings. That would be exellent. Luckly for her she doesn't exist. The other is about some old rich widow whose biggest fear is becoming the main topic of gossip in her small town. She's an odd one. Not to metion I just started Jane Eyer which is an wonderful book and I really want to keep read. And now I have Amy's book on top of it all.  Holy Snickerdoodle, this blog just keeps getting worse and worse. Now it has even more worthless ramblings then before. And none of it is nessaecary. Oh dear...  Too bad  Stubborn Mark

      Ok, so your probably all wondering why I haven't written in this blog for so long. I could give you the truth or the exaggerated truth...  Truth- I have been at a christian camp meeting for the Penn. Conv. of SDA church at Blue Moutain Academy in Hamburg. I was there for one week, exculding comeing back for the last two days of school. I made many new friends and met up with some old ones. And I got to see the movie Equilibruim which is as good as, if not better than, the Matrix. Don't believe me? Watch it. It's on sale at Best Buy for $10.  Exaggerated Truth- My mother grew tired of all my complaints (I sleep on the floor, I have to obey whatever my two evil step-sisters tell me to do, I have to clean the fireplace so often I get cinders all over me, etc.) and she threw me out on to the street. I decided to go to my grandmothers house on the other side of the woods. She's old, senile, and completely bedridden but because of all the morphine her doctors have been shooting up in her she's a hell of a lot nicer than my mom. So I head out with only this little basket of food and my red wind-breaker across the woods to my grandmother's house. I get half way there and I see these three pigs in this one brick house be terroized by a wolf. I knew it wasn't any of my buissness but I had to help out the poor piggies. So I sneaked up beside him and karatie chopped him in the neck. He was out like a light. The pigs were very grateful and gave me a lift to my grandmothers house. Once I got to my grandmother's house I went in to find that she was out by the lily pond. I went out back to find her but all I found was this really big talking toad that wanted me to kiss it. I have no problem with toads unlike all those ditsy girls out there so I did. And what do you know, it turned into a hansome prince. He was very grateful to and gave me a free coupon for his dragon-saving-services. As it turns out, my grandmother got turned in to a pumpkin-shaped carriage. And her famous spoon collection got turned in to pretty gray horses. Now, I know it was mean to take advantage of this but I got in to the carriage and it took he to an enchanted castle where this pretty girl was chatting up a big beast thing. I tried talking with them about the Inappropriateness of inter-species relations but they just gave me a magic bottle that said "Drink me" on it and left. Now, if my mother had given me any good advice it was always to relay on the kindness of strangers. So I drank the stuff and found myself in a high school computer lab where I am now relaying this entire story to you. What will I think of next?  I maybe going to Italy this summer. hooray.

      I was looking outside my back window and saw the brand new patio furnature that my mum just bought cheap. I thought that it was a shame to let them go to waste so I went out and sat in one of the chairs. I live in a nicely wooded area and I got to watch the wind in the trees and listen to the chirping of the birds. It was all very pleasent and serene. I was breathing in the warm soft spring air. The sun was almost set. It was beautiful.  I decided to take a walk around my backyard. Then I impulsively did a cartwheel. Being successful at that I tried a forward flip and ended up on my back. Not hurt bad I tried again and again. I couldn't make it work for me. Then I came up with the bright idea to bend my knees and land on my hands and go from there. So I get as far as bending my knees and as I lunge forward I chicken out and land very painfully on my right shoulder. It still hurts.  And the worst part is that I can't complain about it because I hurt it being really stupid. Dammit.  Outside just isn't as appealing anymore   Injuried Mark

      Just finshed Catch-22. At first it seemed like such a silly book but it changes on you. It is actually a mind-reeling satire that shows the stupidicy of war and those who wish to benefit from it. I really enjoyed it and recommend it highly to anyone that has three weeks to spare. It's a very long book but it's worth it.  I also read Oedipus Rex. I thought that it would be very boring and dry but it was surprisingly modern. I could relate with all the characters. The plotline, though a bit unorthodox in a way that I disliked, was logical and made sense. Except for in one scene a random messenger is very much intwined with the controversy of Oedipus's misfortune. I thought that Sophceles resorted to a very convientent coniencidence with that one.  Now onto On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony.  *sigh* I have no life.  Bookworm Mark

      My Dad's girlfriend just sent this to me.   Jake was dying. His wife, Becky, was maintaining a candlelight vigil by his side. She held his fragile hand, tears running down her face Her praying roused him from his slumber He looked up and his pale lips began to  move slightly. "Becky my darling," he whispered "Hush my love," she said. "Rest, don't talk." He was insistent. "Becky," he said in his tired voice,  "I have something that I must confess." "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping Becky, "everything's all right, go to sleep." "No, no. I must die in peace, Becky. I ... I slept with your sister, your best friend, her best friend and your mother!" "I know, my sweet one" whispered Becky,  "let the poison work."  Dumb guy. He should have known better.

      My tribute to the beloved seniors now leaving my school.  To Sara: I was friends with you since I first meet you. I have never heard you get mad or curse anyone out. You are by far one of the sweetest people I have ever meet. I wish for you many babies with Davie Havok from AFI and the lead singers from the bands Cradle of Filth and Orgy. Rock on my clairnet buddy. All the best at Art school. You are a truly talented and worthy artist.  To Cory: Our gym class was the best ever. The memories of our little group were sweet. Since the begining of this year our friendship has wilted, but I still hope the best for you. May the road rise to meet you.  Diana: Though I meet you only this year, you have become a good friend. You introduced me to Counter-Culture and that alone would have made me remember you. But you are a wonderful girl and a better friend. We will always remember the B.O.B. sleepover and the great Round-Robin-Story. Good luck with college and the world out there.  Carrie: I know we haven't got to know each other very well but I still think of you as a friend. Your werid little outbursts never fail to make me laugh. May you always be as cool and clever as you are now. All the best to you in whatever future you chose.  Sarah Lyn-  The Lunch table wouldn't be the same without you. I'm sorry that we couldn't become closer friends. It is truly a shame. I have only myself to blame. Nevertheless I hope you do well in whatever you chose to do. Good Luck  Carol- we never got to do all the things we talked about but that doesn't matter. You were good company in gym class and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have no idea what I would have done without you. Good Luck finding decent work.   Erika- Your an amazing artist and a greater friend. I had wanted to be your friend since the first time I met you and I'm glad that succeeded. You're off to France now and then on to Art school. You have an amazing talent to share and I know you will succeed in whatever you chose to do. Good Luck Bus Buddy.  Ben- Thank god for you, red, and sara in band. I couldn't have survived without you three. The memories of your conversations will be cherished for ever. You have made a lasting impression on everyone you have ever meet. In this way you have made the world a better place already. And now you are going off to make it even better. Being a missionary isn't for everyone, but I know you can do it and do it well. Thanks for introducing Melt Banana to us all. God bless you and keep you well.  So many good friends leaving this year. None of these can ever be replaced by the measley freashmen taking their place.  Sentimental Mark

      Hi, I'm in Rome. How about that? Florence tomorrow. We did the Vatican and the Sistine chapel. Saw that pretty ceiling of Michelaglo's and even his Pieta. It was nice. Rome is kinda nasty it's self and it's making me depressed. Or maybe that's the PMS...  More later when I  have time.  Hey, everyone, where's the love? Send me an email or something! Somethingmorbid88atyahoo.com. I can't do that little a thing with the circle around it since the keyboards are different here in Italy.  Mark

      Concerts I have gone to this summer  Good Brother Earl/Cake- I had never heard of the Earl one before but I watched them since they were opening for Cake. They weren't bad. I enjoyed them plenty. Cake was awesome. I really enjoyed it. But my sister made me leave really early. Mum figured it was because she was a nursing mother and needed to be back to her kid. The played "Sheep go to Heaven, Goats got to Hell" and got the crowd to sing the chorus. It was cool.  Sugarcult/Phantom Planet- This one was a free concert so I didn't really care how good the band were. We got there late and couldn't see the drummer from where we stodd for the Sugarcult one. I still had a lot of fun. They played some old favorites and their new one. Phantom Planet put on a better show than Sugarcult but I didn't enjoy them as much. I was pretty tired of everything. The add-up ended up being 1 flasher, ~10 shoes thrown, countless crowd surfers, and 2 blue balls being thrown around. Me and Olay got our picture taken with the lead singer of Sugarcult. I should be gettig the pic any day now...  Joshua Bell and Philidelphia Symphony Orchestra- Good cultural expierance. The music was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep during the third movement of the second piece. Those those of you who don't know this Bell kid, he is a world famous violinist and voted to be on of the 50 most attractive men in the world. I couldn't see him very well but he had a nice form. All in all, it was nice, except for nature getting a bit overexcited toward the end of the first piece and start raining bullets.   Music Mark

      I'm back from Pittsburg, or a least most of me is. The majority of my hair was left spread out across the lawn. That's right, cyber buddies. For the first time in four years, I have gotten a hair cut more than three inches. More like a foot and a half. I hair lookes a little like Diana's actually. I have many plans for it. I'm not quite sure I like it though. I feel as though I lost a bit of my personality with it. I don't stand out so much in a crowd, not that I did before, but now I look like every other teenage girl. There's nothing bad about it, just different. I suppose I should get used to changes.  I'll see if I can get a pic up on this blog.  Mark (with new and improved hair! comes with pink cowboy hat for extra $0.25!)

      Yah, so I just got home about three days ago. Already I've gone Kayaking, played some tennis with my brother, watched Metropolis, had a physical, went to my friend Liz's birthday party where we went water tubing, knee-boarding, and jet ski-ing. And I just applied and got a job at the library and will join the tennis team next monday. wow.  Anyway, hope you all are doing ok. Maybe I'll write more later.  Mark

      Howdy all,  I'm really not in the mood to write a witty and in-depth blog at the moment but I thought I should try anyway.   The summer breath of the earth carresses my skin   as I step into it's warm embrace   The glittering sparks of jewels shower from the sky    as I wander across soft sweet beds of feathers   The chirping of those unaware of anyone but themselves   delivers a soothing harmony to nature's own melody   And as I close my eyes, I am swepted away on a thousand winged horses   into the darkening sky.     I want sleep.  Wah mark
