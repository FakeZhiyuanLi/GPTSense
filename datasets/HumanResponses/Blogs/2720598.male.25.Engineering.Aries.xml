      Quite on the contrary, whatsmore, in San Diego, my second cousin is getting married.  He is of 29 years of age.  He deserves much congrats on his new persuance of life experiences.  He met a great woman and I hope there lives together will be fulfilling, exciting, and full of wisdom and love.  It seems these days, that my circle of friends have more than their share of drama, worry, wonder, and enigmas.  Seems to be going around these days, thoughts of what the future holds, how will life turn out, living day to day.  I do feel the same sentiments.  Some are even taking a step back and calming down from their fast pace lives to contemplate the decisions and motivations of what drives them to live the life they do.  I have done the same.  And my two closest best friends have done the same.  The three of us have been through so much together, so many experience together in fact that these days we kind of backed off from each others lives to acess our own.  Dont get me wrong, each of us keeps in contact with one another, but moreso, it always seems the topic of dicussion is life, and where we are headed with it.  We are all in our mid 20's and the choices we make now are so critical of the future.  I am truly blessed to have these people in my life.  Without these friends of mine, I couldnt see myself where i am today.  To all the people that have been an influence in my life, I thank you.  Currently, my days are filled with playing chess online, and i am actually becoming quite good.  My record is 19 wins and 6 loses.  I also have been playing some computer games such as FarCry and BroodWar StarCraft, and online Texas Hold'em.  Much fun.  Similarly, i have been keeping up to date with my Los Angeles Lakers, and yes, they are mine, since ive been a fan from the age of 5.  I know they will take it all the way.  The N.B.A. Commisioner Stern, should just give them the rings and go home, it would same everyone lots of time. :0) By the by, im very broke these days due to the new monthly payments for the car and insurance, but im not complaining, i just have to budget my income these days, which means, less partying out and more partying in. :0)  Thank you all for your time, and free to post any comments you have.  Much love you people, and take care always...  Ryan A. Romero 949.735.3372 cell

      Hello World... (or should i say, My small circle of readers),  The Power of Intention, its really powerful, i say!  This Dr. Wayne Dyer knows what he is talking about.  Good man with some great views.  I suggest you look him up on the internet: www.drwaynedyer.com.  I have his book.  My mother gave it to me a few months ago, but then i saw his program on TV on KCET and he is awesome!  Gimme a ring and i'll let you borrow the book, (after im done reading it :0).  Any-who, life is great!  Things are going so well.  I am very fortunate for everything.  And, i am learning so much about myself and life lately.  Pretty much, this year has been a year of change, in my life and for those around me.  And i can say that people are changing for the better.  You see, i believe that everything happens for a reason, and its all part of the "Big Picture" or the "Master Plan".  I am going to focus on intention, that is, what i was put here on this earth to do.  To be more like Him.  God Bless you all and i will see you when i see you!  Ryan

      Hi world,  I havent been writing much, if you have been checking lately.  Many situations are surfacing.  Some are confusing me.  Yet, most are tranquill in nature, and I have found a new nitch.  Compromising situations have fell in my lap as well.  I find myself running.  Literally speaking :0)  Im running about 2.5 miles a day.  I plan to run completely around Mile Square Park without stoping, by the end of July.  Its a good four miles around, doy!  So far, I can run about 2.5 miles, then I walk for 1 mile, then I sprint the last .5 mile.  By the end of the year, I plan on running around the park twice, without stopping.  It feels good when i get back home, sweating.  Even my roomates and his friends are inspired and plan on running with me in the near future.  Anyways, no more time to get into the other details of my life.  I have to get back to work.  Take cares all ya'll!  Much love, respect, and unity to you all!  God Bless, Ryan A. R. 3 2 8

      Hello there, my felow reader.  It is now 2 minutes past midnight, and officially Tuesday.  Its time to back to the real world and work again.  Oh boy.  How short this past weekend felt, and yet it was filled with so much activity.  Lots has happened this weekend.  Lets see...  Friday, I went to Pierce Street Annex, which is a free bar/club in New Port Beach.  I went with Christine and her new roomates.  I love her new roomates, they are all so cool.  I told them, "you guys are living a real 'Real World' series for Huntington Beach.  There are 2 guys and 3 girls, thrown together in one house, to experience day to day life, with nothing but each other. j/k. But they are all great.  Weird thing is, they live right off of Brookhurst and Adams, where my brother Mikey lives.  Its like killing two birds with one stone hanging out in that area.  But i didnt get to chill with Mike this weekend.  I missed his call and he missed mine.  Bad timing i guess.  Anyways, Pierce street was a blast, more fun than i ever had there.  Maybe because of all the dancing we got to do, and the ratio of girls to guys was about 2 to 1.  Lots of eye candy.  A great company to boot.  We danced and drank, and then danced somemore.  Lots of people gave me props on my dancing style, even made a few "dance partners" that night.  Chris is a great dancer, and always has been.  She thinks shes losing "it", meaning her dance skillz, but she isnt.  We stay till closing time.  Afterward, at around 2:00am, we went into there Jacuzzi.  Oh!  It was the best; about 101 degrees and the cool night air.  A night to remember for sure.  Im looking forward to spending a lot of time with Chris and her roomates, they are so chill.  Chris and I stayed up till 4:00am, talking reminiscing of the past, present, and future.  It was surreal, and i had a great time chilling with her...  Saturday was also very action packed.  During the day, I began to rearrange my room, to be a bit more "Fung-shway" sort-to-speak.  It gonna be the bomb.  I really fully didnt like the way my room was decorated from the beginning, a few loose end here and there, even though eveyone thought it was "hella tight!".  But now i get to have time to make it exactly the way i want it to be like.  After that, i went to Escondido, about 45 minutes south of Pechanga, and about 45 minutes East of San Diego.  My dad's co-worker's daughter had a graduation party.  Gemma graduated from USC with a B.A. in Architecture.  Oh man, what a party too.  There was a live filipino band from L.A., but the originated from Olongapo.  Man! They rocked the community center like no other, with great disco songs, and even some of the new pop songs.  Gemma had some cool performances too, like this one filpino dude from Oxnard, who b-boxed on the mike.  Man! this guy sounded just as good as the legends Biz Marke and Rhazel.  You just had to be there to hear it, amazing!  I danced with my family, my little cousin Dylan.  Chilled for a little bit.  I tried to wait for my sister, but they got lost twice, wrong directions i think.  Poor sis.  Well, I bought her a whole box of starburst candy that day, so hopefully she wasnt so pissed.  Anyways, after that it was about 9:30pm, time for L.A.!  James, my bro and ex-roomie, invited me out to club Soho in Downtown L.A..  It was free, since Sharron was waitressing there that night.  It was pretty much a bar with a d.j. and no dancing when we got there.  However, the night turned out to be a blast!  We got lots of beer, got tipsy, played our favorite Taiwanese drinking games, and danced the night away.  Shoko was there, one the loyal visitors to member Justin's Club.  She a cute Japanese girl who is always up for a good time.  We got to dance a whole lot, and she was digging my style.  I love dancing, especially when I know that people are watching.  I love getting a kick out of making them smile, because I usually follow the words and beats of the song.  One of my favorite songs to make people smile to is the song "Baby Got Back" by Sir Mix Alot.  Also Sisqo's "Thong Song" and also Dogg Pound's "Aint No Fun", a few of my friends' favorites.  Well, we end up leaving at around closing time 1:45am, and I safely return home.  No scratches, bumps, or bruises.  Only smiles...  Sunday was a blur.  I get a hair cut, wash my car, and clean the wheels.  I stop my mom's pad to visit the family.  Everyone was napping.  What a way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  :0)  Afterwards, I go backhome , and wait for Alvin to come by, still re-arranging more room, I have so much stuff.  We go everywhere.  First, the block's T.G.I.F's.  An Ultimate Long Island Iced Tea later,  we went to Spectrum's Fox Sports Grill.  An Adios M*tha F@$ker later, we go to Spanky's.  Oh boy!  Then we go home.  Afterwards, I went over to Christine's again.  And again, we a little Jacuzzi time, this time just the two of us.  They all were in the Jacuzzi already for like 2 hours.  She was already cleaned up when i got there, but she decided to go in again, just for me.  What a sweetie.  We sizzle, and chat for like 45 minutes.  Then we watched about an hour and 15 minutes worth of Harry Potter the Sorceror's Stone with the other roomates.  That movie is so cute.  By this point, im getting really tired of all the events of the past few days.  We call it quits in the middle of the movie, around 1:30am, and this is late late Sunday, early Monday.  I highly suggest this to you my dear reader, if you are ever awake past midnight, late Sunday night, listen to 95.5 KLOS radio.  There is a man there, by the name of Frank Sauntag, who host one of the my thought provoking, insightful radio shows ever.  He talks about spirtuality, love, politics, and many other topics.  He's great and i suggest you listen to him sometime...  Now its Monday, (im getting tired from writing all of this :0)  Today was a totally lazy day for me, recuperation if you will.  I didnt do much.  Just watch Spy Kids the movie, went to a "coffee shop" to watch the Laker Game, which they won by the way, and thats it.  A totally beautiful day of laziness and relaxation, although I still have lots of work left to do in my room, this project might take a few weeks, since free time is something I lack during working days; a whole other story entirely :0)  I played games and chatted with Long and Bert and Tuan, spent most of the day with those dudes.  I was supposed to give Christine a call, because were gonna do a marathon movie hopping and watch three movies in a day, but I didn't call her, sorry Chris.  I'll make it up to you...  Anyways, I need to get to bed, there was more that I wanted to write here, but its long enough as it is.   Sorry if there are any gramatical errors, I dont have anytime to check it :0) Much love always, my dear reader.  I pray that the Lord will be with you always...  Always and Forever, Ryan A. Romero  P.S. Hi May, cant wait to see if what we are talking about can become reality :0)
