      Am back in Reading...  Joy of joys...  Scott and Christine's wedding went well and it was fairly baking weather.  I wasn't quite all there there though and spent a while on the phone to Graça.  Today I've been bored stupid.  Tidyed room a bit, watched athletics on TV etc.  Boring, boring, boring...  Tomorrow should be better have an MOT on my car and then Kathryn arrives in the afternoon, ready to come to BXL with me.  Sorry not really with it tonight!  More soon!

      Hello, hello.  Am pissed off with being unemployed...  Really starting to chaff my winkle.  There's just nowt interesting around, I have big debts and no way to pay rent etc.  All in all, it's a right pile of arse.  Cooked for WMiE people last night.  Had a great weekend in London with the newly casados last week.  No romance in my life...  Going to become a hermit.  I'm cheerful aren't I?  Well the weather's nice at least - 27° in September, can't complain.  GET ME A JOB

       urlLink  Guardian Unlimited  Guardian daily comment  A Harry Potter politics        Sorry, is it me or does Denis MacShane come out with some slanted codswallop? I'm glad he's pro-European and all but Jesus he talks some nonsense. People in Europe look at the UK and say 'I wish our country had the low unemployment of the UK' of course, but equally they see a place of little culture, failing infrastructure (the only reason our investment's rising is because of 50 years of underinvestment...), and xenophobia. The UK is becoming more and more intolerent and this is a reason I'm abroad - I cannot stand the Little Englander mentality...

        Let's blog a bit...         So, I'll write a bit on my blog for once...      Last night I met my Portuguese mate Ricardo and some other Iberians for a pitta and beer.  Randy Ricky's been in Porto for 2 weeks so was good to catch-up - turns out his Grandpa died the day he got home while he was on a bus...  Not nice.  But he seemed in fine fettle, randy as ever - prattling on about this Spanish bird's eyes!      Anywhos, today the rain's returned to Brussels - I shouldn't be surprised but arg!      Time to get on with some work!      A+

        Bored in Brussels         So, it's that time of the year where continental Europe shuts down... BXL is a ghost-town I tell you... 2 people in my office... I'm struggling to achieve anything so I'm playing around on this instead... It's one of the few times I think the British consumer-driven, capitalism is all attitude has its value... Jesus, how can these European states not go bankrupt when everyone on hols??? Imagine if peeps worked in August - Europe might catch the UK up and stop being so economically sluggish...        Gah!        Leeds lost last night - arg! Hope we get to the ruddy play-offs...
