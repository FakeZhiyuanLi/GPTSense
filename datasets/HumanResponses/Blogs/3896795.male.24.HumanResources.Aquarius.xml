      We all know that anyone, anywhere, for any reason whatsoever can find that there is No Evidence to support Anything. Data, thusly, is meaningless. Only the latest "There is no Evidence" is the real truth, and how much they were paid to make their claims.  Bottom Line: Money Talks, Truth Walks.  So, dear readers, remember always that there is no evidence until it happens to you, but by then you will have become a statistic, your data is thus meaningless, and you are thereby forgotten.

      In 1981 NASA sent up the first space shuttle, which used Intel 8086 processors for a host of diagnostic equipment. More than 20 years on these chips are still being used to make sure the shuttle's twin booster rockets are safe for blast-off, and NASA is finding it increasingly hard to replace any faulty chips.  In the future the space agency plans to create a new US$20 million dollar automated checking system, but in the meantime it has to rely on the old equipment--if something breaks it has to be replaced. Up until recently replacement chips have been found in old medical equipment that NASA buys in bulk, but even these reserves are running low now, and the Internet seems to be NASA's last resort.  It is not just the 8086 chips that are required; old circuit boards, 8-inch floppy drives, and a plethora of obsolescent parts are putting a strain on scheduled testing. Auction sites such as eBay and Yahoo! sell just about everything and have been used by NASA for some of the more hard-to-find items. This search can only get harder however, especially with the current space shuttles scheduled to be in service until at least 2010 (and maybe even 2020).   urlLink http://www.geek.com/news/geeknews/2002may/chi20020514011664.htm

      You know you're in an Australian Summer when:       The best parking space is determined by shade instead of distance.     Hot water comes out of both taps.     You learn that a seat belt buckle makes a pretty good branding iron.     The temperature drops below 35c and you feel a little chilly.     You discover that in February it only takes two fingers to steer your car.     You discover that you can get sunburnt through your car window.     You develop a fear of metal car door handles.     You break a sweat the instant you step outside at 7:30am.     Your biggest bicycle wreck fear is, "What if I get knocked out and end up lying on the pavement and cook to death?"     You realise that asphalt has a liquid state.     While walking back barefoot to your car from the beach, you do a tightrope act on the white lines in the carpark.     You catch a cold from having the aircon full blast while you sleep during the night.     You pray that your train will have airconditioning, and if it doesn't, waiting an extra 15 minutes for one is worth it.

      Funny rant. Good to see some one more riled up and more pissed off than me for a change.  "I would like to think that in this day and age people would know better than to open executables in an e-mail. I'd also like to be able to flap my arms and fly to the moon. Opening attachments in e-mail is one par with group needle-sharing after having unprotected sex in a Third World orgy. Yet, with an estimated 30 per cent [peak] of world-wide e-mail traffic being Novarg, it is clear that millions are willing to blindly point-and-click their way into infection while a tempest of white noise rages in the part of their brain where conscious thought should be."  Tim Mullen, SecurityFocus   urlLink http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/35300.html   Opinion: Sorry to say Tim, part of the problem is systematic when software is designed to conviently does things for you like execute binaries automatically without forcing the user to think about the consequences of their actions.

      Holden Adventura:  "Of the three soft-roaders, it inspired the least amount of confidence among the testers; whoever drew the short straw got to drive it. We quickly established that you would not want to travel "Adventra Island" (according to Holden ad-speak) without a convoy of other, better-equipped off-roaders."  Ford Territory:  "We went looking for a tow point at the rear after the Territory became stuck. Not only could we not find the point, we opened the owner's manual to discover that a tow hook is optional."    and    "Incredibly, Ford is planning to charge extra for a taller suspension kit, for those who want to go off-road. Are we missing something here?"

      Just came back from The Entrance, a get-away from the city life, for the Queen's Birthday long weekend. Stayed at The Waldorf Apartments. It had a sea view. Lounging around was the order of the day. Fed pelicans, ate and slept.  Got to drive Andyman's '03 Astra for the trip. Good power at low revs. Very nice, very nice.  Was able to do heaps of study for the upcoming exams. Had to study outside to avoid getting distracted by the TV. It was bitter cold during the night, but it worked.   Now, this is what a "study vacation" really is!

      Why on earth can't Australia get good hardware such as more Biostar gear, Yeong-Yang, more Cooler Master gear, Sea Sonic, TTGI, more Thermaltake gear, Kingwin, FIC, Case Edge, Foxconn??  All the Australian enthusiest sites could do is refer links to reviews to cool gear on other sites that'd take eons if not for ever to get to our shores. It's like saying "Guys look here at this cool piece of hardware. You'll never be able to buy it so here's a link. HAHAHA!"

      w00t.  What a bizzare week its been. Things at work turning upside-down. People you haven't seen in ages. Two parties, two nights: HKSS/UCS/CSS on Thursday night then ClubSingapura on Friday night. I keep having to reiterate to my friends my policy regarding nightclubs and chicks: I don't pick up in nightclubs beacuse I don't want no bimbo hoe. William tells me there should be an IQ screening device outside every nightclub along with the usual security and door-bitch ontarage.  Bledisloe Cup duty tonight, hope Australia wins. City to Surf tomorrow, Candy has been delgated the role of personal alarm clock.  Cafe del Mar 11 is sick, fully.
