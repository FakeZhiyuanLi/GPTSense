						   An excerpt from _Making a Living Without a Job: Winning Ways for Creating Work that You Love_ by Barbara J. Winter:  When you are willing to invest in yourself and your ideas, you have put your money and time into the one thing that lasts a lifetime and can never be taken from you. Businessman and author Bob Conklin tells this story: "Twenty years ago, my wife and I evaluated all the ways we had spent and invested money. Stocks, cars, insurance, real estate, furniture, and all other major investments were scrutinized. Do you know what investments outdistanced others by an enormous percentage? Ourselves. Any investments in our growth or self-improvement had paid incredible returns. Books, courses, seminars, conventions - whatever the learning experience - had always returned far greater rewards than any other investment. The best investment in life is in your own self-development. It will pay off the greatest financial and emotional rewards."   (page 65)   Thanks to my dad for giving me this book!

						   I invented cereal salad, the breakfast food, but A. (E.'s girlfriend) is the one who coined the phrase.  I think I wind up putting about a dozen different things in my cereal.  To wit:  1. usually some kind of commercially prepared cereal: granola and/or something organic and low-wheat (actually, from this point on, in this and future posts, assume that most ingredients are organically grown) 2. oat bran (I actually like oat bran.) 3. puffed kamut and/or millet 4. raisins? 5. sunflower seeds 6. walnuts and/or cashews and/or pecans and/or almonds 7. vanilla and/or original Edensoy soymilk 8. cinnamon? often. cardamom? occasionally 9. hazelnut milk? oat milk? if I have some of one or the other, I'll add it. 10. shredded coconut 11. frozen blueberries, although never in combination with raisins. particularly useful when the only liquid is plan soymilk. 12. banana? eh. not so much recently.  So it's a whole production. Funny: a dozen, on the nose. But that's not including sub-parts.  The interesting thing is that since soy milk is sweeter than cow's milk, if you're using soy milk you can eat cereal that's been less sweetened.  Well, maybe that *isn't* the interesting thing.

						   I've been collecting these mini-poems for several years now, and recently have been putting them into an Excel spreadsheet. I have about 600 at this point. ("Spreadsheet poetry" is an enchanted ingredient.)  The idea is that although some of them are just ear candy (yes, "ear candy" is an enchanted ingredient), others constitute a vocabulary of my life. I intend to post essays about selected enchanted ingredients.  But first, to give you a taste of what I'm talking about, here are the A's (by first part). Most of these I came up with myself, but certain ones (with initials in parentheses after the ingredient) are from other people.  a train of thought that	hasn't left the station (S.

						   What if after we leave the synagogue all our prayers huddle together and talk about us?  What if they reach consensus?  What if a representative sneaks out the door and runs over to the other synagogue, to the mosque, to the church?  What if prayers have conventions?  Maybe that's God.

						   Welcome to my space in binary-land. I expect to be posting some of my creative work and musings in the near future. But for now, a reader's journal:  Today I rediscovered Grace Paley's _Long Walks and Intimate Talks_.  Today I read more of Making a Living Without A Job (which I started on Tuesday).  Today I discovered The Unemployment Survival Guide.

						   I've used most of these as signature quotes. Enjoy!  "The need to capture and express what the rest of the world can't or won't see is a major driving force of an artist." ~ Barbara Ware Holmes (in the book  Letters to Julia , which I own and am happy to loan out)  "We decided that it was no good asking what is the meaning of life, because life isn't an answer, life is a question, and you, yourself are the answer." ~ Ursula K. Le Guin  "Such grain is considered to belong to an intermediate category between immovable and movable property." ~ Steinsaltz on the Talmud: Baba Metzia 31A  to make visible that which, without you, might perhaps have never been seen &nbsp;(I read this on a poster at U Penn a few years ago and don't know the source.)  "To live is so startling, it leaves little time for anything else." ~ Emily Dickinson  True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. (Page 47,  Rich Dad Poor Dad  by Robert Kiyosaki with Sharon Lechter)  "Life is short, but the days and nights are long." Cheryl Wheeler  "A bird does not sing because it has an answer. It sings because it has a song."&nbsp; ~ unknown  "Go ahead, push your luck, find out how much love the world can hold." > Dar Williams   +++++++++++++++++++++++ "mmmm impossible dreams make children of us all down the rabbit hole we fall and eat and drink and grow and make our heart a home and often wonder why wonder when when we will fly over the rainbow" - Jennie Avila (half of this very sweet singer/songwriting duo named Amy and Jennie) in the song "How Rich The Life"   ************  "I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important tome must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - audre lorde  "Sometimes I lie awake at night, and I ask, "Wherehave I gone wrong?"&nbsp; Then a voice says to me, "This is going to take more than one night." --Charlie Brown  "PEACE is joy at rest. JOY is peace standing on its feet." - Anne Lamott's pastor's mother&nbsp;( Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century )  Our task: "to leave the campsite of Earth cleaner than it was."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Sam Daley-Harris ( Imagine: What America Could Be in the 21st Century )  "Politics: The energy one expends to create a community to meet one's spiritual needs." ~ Martha Ackelsberg

						   Just in case you were wondering, John Kerry's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention lasted just about long enough for me to clean a long-neglected stove. I didn't touch the oven itself, but got to pretty much every other surface, including all the dials on the front of the stove. Six dials: 4 burners, one oven -- so what was the sixth one for? It said "grid." Yes, that's right. After living in this house since December, I&nbsp;discovered that my stove has a built-in griddle. And yes, I cleaned both the griddle and the griddle cover.   Thanks, John.   I used probably a quarter cup of baking soda. (Thanks to whoever told me that baking soda cuts grease.) Okay, maybe that's an exaggeration.   I used a scrubbee cloth that I got from my Oma, perhaps from Israel. I washed it a bunch of times in the kitchen sink.   I like this John Kerry guy. I have to say, I still don't think I'd recognize his face. No matter.   Thanks to WHYY in Philly. This is the longest in a long time I've listened to anyone  talking  on the radio.   News. I've been gradually building up to actually actively seeking out mass media news consumption.   &nbsp;  I have a personal&nbsp;custom of defrosting and cleaning out my fridge on September 11. Now I'm excited to see how my kitchen will benefit during this election season.  And I hope that the energy and passion I put into cleaning up my kitchen will have some kind of karmic effect on the White House.   Greetings and&nbsp;grease, &nbsp; Ilana
