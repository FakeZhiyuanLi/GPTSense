      wow, well today was great.&nbsp; 3 of the 4 band members came over and although we only praticed for like 38 seconds, we finished a whole song(most of the time we played grandtheft auto or ate milk and cookies).&nbsp; not bad for our first pratice.&nbsp; katie, alex1 and alex2... rock on.&nbsp; but anyways,&nbsp; my girlfriend broke up with me and it was mutual,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course, but now she calls me like 25 times a day.&nbsp; and i mean she actually calls me 25 times every day!&nbsp; so apparently she's not intrested in me, yet i'm intresting enough to disturb 25 damn times a day.&nbsp; and on the rare occation that i don't press the ignore button she never has anything important to say!&nbsp; it's always this long awkard pause that ends with me saying something like, "um, my elbows caught on fire can i call you back" or "i left my tv on and i need to go watch it.&nbsp;so, bye you crazy phscyo man destroyer"&nbsp; well a few good things came out of the relationship. oh wait, no they didn't.&nbsp; i used to enjoy hearing my ring tone all the time (cuz i made up a little dance to it) but now i agree with alex,&nbsp; cell phones are the devil!&nbsp; (check out his phone paragraph at&nbsp; &nbsp;malex.blogspot.com)&nbsp; ok well i better stop writing because my crazy ex is standing outside my window with a shotgun threatening to blow my head off if i stop loving her.&nbsp; i told her to freakin pull the trigger already so i don't have to listen to this crap anymore.&nbsp; lol&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -steve

      hey,&nbsp; well i've decided to blog it up after reading a friend's passionate, yet insightful&nbsp;blogs.&nbsp; (malex.blogspot.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i recommend&nbsp;the&nbsp;damn alexander grahm bell one)&nbsp;anyways,&nbsp; i'm sure my life is too boring to actually read about so... i'll just make up a bunch of lies :&nbsp; yesterday, i was walking down the street and i shot some guy in the face and stole his car.&nbsp; then cops and the swat team chased me but i pulled out a chain saw and sliced them up real good.&nbsp; actually that was all the stuff i did while playing grand theft auto.&nbsp; man what a great game.&nbsp; it's too bad that you can't hold up a police station and then get a change of clothes and expect them not to recognise you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if i ever blow up a cop car i'm definatily going to bring a change of clothes and i don't mean just any clothes... i mean like a ninja outfit.&nbsp; if worst comes to worst i'll just blame my juvenile actions on the creators of the game.&nbsp; okay well, it's been almost four minutes since i stopped playing so i'm gonna go&nbsp;restart the game and reign down a fierce storm of havoc on the poor computer generated souls who live there.&nbsp;

      now i know everybody has had the discussion, "who would win in a fight, this guy or that one". Well i've been thinking, the pope &amp; mother Terisa? but on an extremely serious note, i would like to make a few comparasions.  Alien vs. Predator -i haven't seen the movie, but those are two of the best movie monsters of all time. my vote defiantly goes to Predator, because not only can he shoot and arsonal of whop ass, he can also... um, well what else does he really need?  Superman vs anybody-  ok there's no real comparison here because whoever thought of superman's powers was obviously not playing by the rules. (however, if denis the menance or bart simpson got a kriptonite pebble, those sling shots could be deadly.)  Spiderman vs Batman-  who am i kidding. hands down, game set and match go to spiderman. besides the fact that spiderman is the greatest super hero to come from marvel comics, lets fact it- Batman is just a rich guy with a fast car and a lot of grappling hook type gadgets.  Catwomen vs Posin Ivy-  who cares who wins, as long as they fight in a mud pit, i think everyone will be happy.  the X-Men vs the Fantastic Four-  we all know that wolverine kicks ass. anyways, the fantastic four really got screwed out of their super powers. the streachy guy would be sliced up real nice by wolverine's animantium claws. the invisible chick would get hit by a car while crossing the street. The flame guy would be extinguished by storm's rain clouds, then hit by lightning, then hit by a giant ball of hail, then laughed at. um i don't know how to kill a rock, but that last guy would probably just drowned or something. so there you have it: the X-Men, Spiderman, and Predator all kick ass!!!! man i want super powers -steve

      ok well it's 10:00 and it's the last night of summer! i figured i should probably reflect on all the cool and worth while things that happened. ah. ok i'm done. no really- i'd like to thank alex pru, dustyn, fay, katie, (adam-robert-anyce and brittney too, eventhough they caused a lot of problems lol) and a new girl named danielle (met her in cali while boogie boardin). well it's been another fun year of blowing stuff up, shooting stuff, riding dirtbikes, making music/noise etc. the only things i regret are not quitting my job sooner, and not getting a motorcycle. god i want an sport bike to ride around on! i don't think my parents understand how much i want a bike! if one more person says "it's too dangerous" i swear i'm going to... to... do something really bad &amp; painful!! i know this is the typical teenager response, but what's the point in living if you never do anything exciting. i've been on motocross bikes for a few years now and i defiantly know how to ride. bescides, riding a streetbike doesn't mean i'm just going to spontaneously combust or something. well i don't know about anyone else, but if i live to be like 95 i'm going to have some sweet and exciting stories about all the crazy things i did as a kid. i think i'm going to go start off the school year with a bang and free all the animals at the zoo!!!!!! freedom aaahhhhh!!!!!!!! -steve

      tonight i was talkin to alex online and he brings up an interesting point: all my ex girlfriends are acting pretty wierd lately. you might have already read the 'carzy grilfriend' blog i wrote, but here's another. this girl (lets just call her... um... jade. or. crap that's her real name, ok. jade) anyways, i went out with her in 8th grade and we dated for a hella long time--like 9 months (remember how long that was in 8th grade?). well she called my friend tonight and asked us if we wanted to hang out with some people in a parking lot. i'm pretty sure we said "a parking lot? sure that sounds like a bangin party yo" or something. no sooner than we ended up there, one of the girls there was all over my friend--mostly it was the acohol talking. but jade started throwin some mad body language at me, and i was trying not to flirt too much. it's just wierd because i haven't talked to her since she broke up with me 3 years ago, and she was my first real girlfriend. i don't want to say anything bad about her, eventhough she thinks i talk shit behind her back, but lets just say- that's a road i don't want to take again. unfortunatly, i felt like i pretty much had to kiss her, once. or four times. now i'm screwed because i have to explain to her that i'm not intrested in going out with some party animal chick (which i'm sure she is) especially after she broke up with me. and don't cry for me or anything, but that break up was pretty hard on me. so... it's her fault that i view all girls in a different way now. you know what i mean right? it's like when you repeatedly slap some kid upside the head for no reason and he grows up to be a really twichy wierdo. that's what i'm talkin about. so yeah i guess i'll just tell her that i've changed since 8th grade, believe it or not. or i could avoid her- forever. somebody help me:( -steve

      i was thinking... there should be some kind of point system. you know, like everytime you do something cool you get a point (like crack a sweet your mom joke). but on the other hand, if you do something morer un-cooler-like, you lose a point (um... maybe you would loose a point if you slept with your friends girlfriend!!! or something) anyways i didn't think of this by myself. at work we used to have a point system and you would get a star if you did something good. unfortunatly, they didn't even put my name up on the chart. i asked the manager about that and he just said it's because i never do anything good... and um... i stabbed him. no. but i wanted to, even though he was right. well the star chart was dumb anyway. why don't we just forget about the whole point system. i see too much potential for controversy- like maybe you would argue over the validity of a three pointer because the buzzer rang at the end of the third quarter. wait what? yeah lets just forget about the whole point system--that's just another reason to stay away from golf n stuff, nothing good ever comes from that place. in conclusion i would just like to say... bee boo baa boo                                    -steve

      what the hell! AAAAAAAHHHHHHHh ok well i just typed a nice little paragraph about todays dirtbiking mishap and once again my computer freezes as i click the save button. so now i'm going to write a different article about how i hate everything! although i hate people that whine, i'll cut myself some slack and complain for a minute. i hate mustard, i hate rap, i hate the people who came up with the idea of putting silent letters in words, and the guy who invented the letter "C" because it's either an "S'' or a "K" (believe me, we don't need a C in the alphabet). back to stuff i hate-- i hate everything school related, i hate the fact that i don't have any super powers, i hate ranch dressing (eventhough everyone else seems to like it), i hate the song "i hate everything" by garth brooks--not his best work : ( did i say i hate rap, cuz that one's at the top of the list! i also hate how so many people listen to rap even though there's nothing musical about it. usually when i go to a  music  consert, i expect to see instruments; i don't expect to see a bunch of guys talk really fast about how 'pimp' they are despite what the 'hoes' have to say. common!! they don't even sign. and the freakin 'bling bling'? only mr. T is cool enough to pull that off. and platinum teeth? well that's cool, like the jaws guy in james bond--sweet. "well to finish this off, i hate how there's too many annoying things to name in this blog. why not one more eh? i hate the people who don't turn their cell phones off in movies, and i really really hate the people who answer them aaahhhh die people who answer thier cell phones while not in an appropriate place. um... i feel better now -steve p.s. i also hate pop-ups &amp; junk mail with a passion
