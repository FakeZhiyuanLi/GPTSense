        This story isn’t so much funny as it is scary. At least, that’s how I felt at the time.   The summer before I became a senior in high school, I flew to California to check out the University of Los Angeles. It was my college of choice, (because it was on the other side of the country away from my family) and I just wanted to make sure I was making a wise decision. My cousin Eddy lived out there, so I planned on staying with him for a week and a half, and he was going to show me around.  A lot of hilarious things ensued while I was there, but right now, I’m just going to focus on one incident, The Absinthe Incident.  One night, after touring the college grounds and some of the surrounding city, Eddy and I made a bet. Whichever one of us could get laid the most got to have the bottle of absinthe that he had obtained. How could I turn down a chance to win free, not to mention illegal, alcohol? That’s right, I couldn’t. And guess what? I won. Never doubt what a drunk will do for their alcohol. It was a close race, but in the end, I beat Eddy by one guy. That’s about the time I officially started my journey into Whoredom.  So on the last day I was there, as Eddy was dropping me off outside the airport, he handed me that bottle of heavenly alcohol, with tears in his eyes. I poured the absinthe into a plain, old water bottle just to be safe (yeah, safe), and hid it on the bottom of my suitcase, under a pile of clothes. Then I hugged Eddy goodbye, told him to enjoy his beer, because I would be enjoying his absinthe, which seriously pissed him off, and I headed into the airport.  I was blissfully thinking of that bottle in the bottom of my bag, when I got in line to get my bags scanned. I casually walked through the metal detector, and made it through without any problems. Not so with my bags.  Oh Jesus. Oh holy Jesus. “Excuse me ma’am, but we’re going to have to check your bags.” They were unzipping my suitcase! They were digging through it! I tried to tell the man to, “Stop goddamn it! It’s only my safety scissors I use to cut hemp for making necklaces!” but he didn’t listen. I could feel the sweat running down my sides. What if he found my water bottle? What if he opened it? Then what would I do?  The security officer lifted up the clothes that were shoved into my suitcase, and there was my absinthe. He was already replacing the clothes in my suitcase when I exclaimed, “It’s just my water bottle! You know, full of water!” Why couldn’t I just have shut my mouth? The guy hadn’t even suspected anything until I burst out with that odd remark. He looked at me suspiciously, his mouth set in a hard line. This guy wasn’t fucking around. He retrieved the water bottle again, and started to unscrew the lid. I squeezed my eyes shut, and started to pray to God to have pity on a poor, diseased alcoholic.  I heard him take a long, hard sniff of the contents, and I literally felt my heart thud to the bottom of my feet. I braced myself, waiting to be tackled, handcuffed, and led away. I stood there probably for thirty seconds, not breathing. When nothing happened, I slowly, nervously, opened my eyes.  “Well,” said the security man, “looks like they’re making water a lot stronger these days.” I swear on my fucking life, those were his exact words. I just stood there, looking like an idiot, with my mouth hanging open.  “You were right, it was a pair of scissors, and they are safeties, so you get to keep them. Sorry for the inconvenience.” He replaced the contents of my bags, and handed them over to me. I started walking towards my plane, more than a little dazed. “What in God’s name had just happened?” I remember saying aloud to myself. Lets count the number of laws I broke that the security guy let me get away with:  1.) Absinthe is ILLEGAL in the U.S. 2.) I was underage…by FIVE years. 3.) It’s illegal to bring alcohol onto a plane, from one state to another.  I am now convinced there is a God, and that he favors us alcoholics.  As soon as I got home, I poured myself a glass of absinthe, threw in some ice, and made a toast to my Holy Homeboy.

        One day, I was hanging out with a couple of friends in my apartment, having a few drinks and telling stories, when the topic of amusement parks came up.  It soon came out that Mary, a girl I went to college with, had never been on a roller coaster before.  She’d never even been on one of those crappy little ones that seem to grow on boardwalks.  Being an avid roller coaster fan myself, I immediately offered to take her to Six Flags Magic Mountain.  She agreed, if a little reluctantly at first.  We made plans to go there for the next weekend.  When she left later that night, she seemed quite excited.  A couple days passed, and I didn’t hear anything more from her.  But then, the day before we were supposed to go to Six Flags, she calls me all upset.  She informed me that she had changed her mind, and she didn’t want to go.  She told me she was scared shitless of heights, and that nothing could make her get on a fucking roller coaster.  It took twenty minutes of convincing her that she would be fine, absolutely fine, before I could get her to change her mind again.  I’m sure she didn’t get any sleep that night.   The next day, when I arrived at her house with a few other friends to pick her up, she was looking extremely nervous.  Feeling a rare fit of niceness coming over me, I started telling her about how roller coasters only look scary, promising her that they were loads and loads of fun.  Just as she was starting to calm herself down, Adam, who was sitting in the backseat with her, starts telling Mary about all the people who have died on roller coasters.  He even made up some story about a girl who flew out of her seat, traveled a few miles, and landed on some guy, killing him instantly.  She laughed hysterically for a few minutes.  I think she actually believed him.   By the time we actually got there, she was on the brink of a mental break down.  She looked like she was going to cry.  She was seriously getting overworked; I have never seen anyone so scared in my life, and it was starting to annoy me.   We bought our tickets and headed towards our first ride.  I decided to be kind, and we got in line for one of the smaller roller coasters.  She made me hold her hand in line.  My God.  This pissed me off, and when it came time to get on, I made her sit by herself.  My words of comfort, “It’s time to face your fears, bitch.”  Before the ride even started, she was shrieking her head off.  I mean, this was some serious, high pitched, someone’s murdering me scream.  I was glad I didn’t sit with her, because if I had, I would probably be deaf now.   When we started to move, her shrieking got so incredibly loud that someone behind her told her to, “Shut the fuck up!”  I don’t think she heard him.   When we went over the first drop, her screaming reached an amazing crescendo.  And then there was silence.  I was pretty convinced she had passed out.  I couldn’t help looking over my shoulder to check, and to my udder amazement, she was smiling!   When we got off the ride, she couldn’t help gushing about how much fun it had been.  See, I am useful for something.   We went around to a bunch of the smaller coasters, and gradually advanced to the bigger ones.  When we came to the mother of all roller coaters, which happened to be Superman the Escape, the tallest, fastest roller coaster in the entire WORLD, I wasn’t really expecting her to say no.  She had been having an absolute blast.  But I was wrong.  Mary sternly informed the rest of us that she would have to be completely loaded before she would ever go on that huge scary beast.  Oh, wait, good idea.  We’re not the brightest bunch.    We all went out to the parking lot, got the twelve- pack from the back of the car, and continued to force- feed Mary alcohol.  Oh, yes, this is going to be good.  We ended up getting her a little drunker than we had initially planned.  Oops.   We went back into the park, found that ride, and got in line.  Then we were getting in the car, we were moving, and we were going over the hugest fucking drop ever.  Mary was sitting in front of me (thank God), and she seemed to be doing ok.  A little misjudgment on my part.  We were going over the last drop, when it happened.  I saw Mary lurch forward in slow motion, and holy shit!  Holy shit!  I watched with wide eyes as chunks of vomit flew out of her mouth, spraying all over the bald guys back in front of her.  Oh Jesus.   But the guy didn’t turn around!  Could it possibly be?  The stupid ass didn’t even feel it!  He didn’t feel the vomit that had hit him, and which was now running down his back, over the edge of his seat.  I stared at Adam, who was sitting next to me, with an open mouth.  He looked back at me, just as stunned.   I looked around me; no one seemed to have noticed Mary’s little adventure.  As soon as we came to a stop, we were out of our seats, grabbing Mary, and dragging her down the exit ramp.  Just as we were about out of earshot, I heard someone scream, “Oh my God, Frank!  Your back!”   We got the fuck out of there as fast as our legs could carry us.  We ran into the parking lot, piled into the car, propped Mary up against the window, and peeled out of that place.   Mary hasn’t spoken to me since.  A small price to pay for a good story.  It’s not my fault she can’t hold her alcohol.

        Recently, after returning back to the East Coast, I had decided to go shopping.  I had just finished moving into my cousin’s apartment in Philadelphia, for reasons I don’t care to discuss, and he was already asking me to clear out for the day.  His fiancé was coming back from a business trip she had been on for the last week and a half, and he wanted to have some quality time with her to “discuss their upcoming wedding plans.”  What he really meant was that he didn’t want me to be around when he fucked the shit out of her.  So I took the hint and left.   Having nothing better to do at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, I decided to hit the stores, spending way more money that I ever should have.   Carrying about twenty different bags, and feeling tired out, I had begun to debate what to do next.  But then I found myself standing outside of a Victoria’s Secret, and a girl can never have enough underwear, so I went on in.   I was examining tables full of pretty, lacy g-strings with cute little bows on them, when my eye caught site of a completely delicious looking piece of man candy.  Feeling game for a little innocent flirting, I started to slowly make my way towards him, stopping here and there for a few seconds pretending to examine some see-through, slutty pieces of lingerie.   When I had worked my way up to him, I so casually tapped him on the shoulder and, holding up two different pairs of thongs, and him which one he thought was sexier.  His cheeks turned so pink it was amazing.  Just a tad shy, don’t you think?  I decided I could have a lot more fun with this guy than I had expected.   “Well, what do you think?”  “Uh…”  “Do you want me to try them on and show you?”  “My, uh, girlfriend…”  “Ok, hold on one sec.  I’m going to go put them on.  Don’t move.”  The look on his face was priceless.  I was barley holding myself together.   I walked over to the dressing room, and quickly put one of the thongs on, letting myself laugh quietly for a minute.  Then I opened the door and called him over.  He came stumbling over, not really aware of what he was doing.  He was so flustered.   “Do you like it?”  “Um, yeah.”  “But does they make my butt look big? I turned around, showing him my entire ass.  I thought he was going to have a heart attack.  I love myself.   “Uh…No. Not at, uh, all.”   “Well, let me show you the other pair.”  I winked at him and shut the dressing room door.  When I opened it again to show him he next pair, I saw that his girlfriend had now rejoined him.  Even better.   “Hey, Mr. Gorgeous!”  I called out.  He turned slowly to look at me. “What do you think, do these look even sexier on me?”  His girlfriend’s eyes were bulging out of their sockets.  The vein in her forehead looked like it was going to burst at any moment.  The guy was so nervous he was shaking.  I almost felt bad for him for a second.  But not quite.  His girlfriend turned her eyes away from me and back to her boyfriend.  “Do you know this girl?!”  She said icily.   I broke in before he could respond.  “Oh, well, I just couldn’t for the life of me decide which pair of underwear I should by, and this sweetie,” I said gesturing towards her boyfriend,  “offered to judge which pair looked better on me.”   Silence.  “I think he was right.”  I said, examining myself in front of the mirror.  “The first pair did make me look incredibly hot.  These aren’t as great.  Thanks for your help, honey.”  I went back into the changing room, expecting them to still be there when I came out dressed.  But they were gone.  Too bad.  I would have liked to tell people I had been in a bitch fight in the middle of a lingerie store.  Oh well.  I went and bought myself a drink instead.

        I first met Dustin at a gay dance club in L.A. I had just broken up with my long time boyfriend of three years, and I was heart broken. He was the first and only guy I have ever been in love with. I had been sitting in my apartment for the last week, slowly empting my liquor cabinet of its contents. Everyone knows that alcohol solves all of your problems.  Around five that night, my good friend Jack came over to tell me that enough was enough, and it was time to get my pathetic ass up and have some fun. I asked him why he couldn’t just let me wallow in my self-pity, didn’t I deserve that much? He said no, not when it meant that my hair looked like a dead, greasy animal that had been glued to the top of my head. “Where have those soft, gorgeous locks gone to, Jasmine?” He asked me. Yes, Jack is gay.  He firmly told me that I had one hour to get myself fabulous looking, and then he would be back to take me out with a bunch of his stunningly gay friends. I was informed that there would be     nothing better for me than going out on the town and discussing what an ass my old boyfriend was with a group of sympathetic gay men. Before I could even protest, he had me in the shower. I was going whether I liked it or not.  Exactly an hour later, he was back. When I came to the door, he told me I looked absolutely stunning, and that if he wasn’t such a homo, he would have sex with me right there. I couldn’t help smiling. He introduced me to the four guys he had brought with him, and they all agreed that I had completely fabulous cheekbones. A lot more guys would get laid if they just acted gay.  Jack hailed two taxis and told the driver to take us to Apache Territory. I asked him what that was. He said it was a gay dance club that he often frequented, and not to worry, he would make sure I had fun. He also informed me that some of the guys had wanted to take me to the Faultline Bar, but he had forbidden it. “You can thank me later,” he said. For all of those who don’t know, the Faultline Bar is basically mobs of gay men in latex rubber and leather, covered in tattoos and body piercings.  At first I felt a little out of place on a dance floor full of fishnet clad men, but they were all just so friendly that I soon found myself enjoying the night immensely. I probably danced with 50 different gorgeous guys before Jack and I went to the bar to take a brake. Too bad they all thoroughly enjoy taking it in the ass.  We both ordered a few shots of gin, and started to discuss this horribly sexy guy that Jack had just been dancing with. Why is it that the only good dancers are either black or gay? Straight, white men have nothing going for them. I bet Jack twenty dollars that he would get laid that night. I went home twenty dollars richer, and Jack went home happy. After a little while, Jack went back out to the dance floor to go pick up his guy, but I stayed at the bar.      I was ordering another shot when a guy, who certainly would have been number one on what Jack liked to call his Men to Fuck and Remember Their Names list, sat down on the stool next to me. Feeling a little buzzed, I asked him why he wasn’t wearing something see-through and glittery. He quickly told me that he was a vagina man, and had only decided to come here, along with his friend, out of curiosity. He said he wanted to expand his horizons, meet a few interesting people. I informed him that I was an interesting person, and started a conversation about the time I had gotten really drunk and ended up having sex with my best friends boyfriend while she was passed out on the couch on the other side of the room, to prove my point. I knew I had him hooked.  We decided to leave and go find a non-gay bar, and I went to find Jack to tell him. I found him standing in a dark corner, getting some serious action from his new friend, and decided not to bother him.  Mr. Fuckable (I still didn’t know his name yet) and I walked a few blocks until we found a bar. He ordered himself and I a round of whisky shots and told me a few good stories about road trips he had taken and a wedding where the bride got really wasted the night before her wedding and ended up puking all over the groom in the middle of the ceremony the next day.  Pretty soon we were making out and getting grotesquely physical in front of the entire bar. “The bathroom.” He whispered to me. I got up and followed him into the men’s room, where we proceeded to have quick and satisfying sex in a blue toilet stall. I know it was seriously nasty. I blame my whoreish behavior on my mother. She did tell me not to except candy from strangers, but she never said anything about having sex with them. It was only after we had finished the deed that I asked him his name, which turned out to be Dustin, the name I had picked out for my future son if I ever decided to have kids. That weirded me out a little.  We walked out of the bathroom together, hand-in-hand, receiving a bunch of curious glances. I was happily enjoying this attention when Dustin screamed, “Holy Shit!” and pulled me down to the ground. Needless to say, I toppled over, in a drunken and confused state. “Jasmine, stay down!” He hissed at me.  “What the hell IS this?” I couldn’t help asking. I mean, come on. I had no idea what was going on.  “Just shut up and slowly follow me.”  I decided it would be best if I just listened to him. We crept along the ground, ducking behind tables and making our way to the door. I saw these two immensely obese girls standing by the bar, and couldn’t help pointing out their obscene extra weight to Dustin. “My God, I know.” He cried. “Just don’t let them see you.” So…we were running from two fat chicks?  We duck behind the last table, and it’s still about six feet to the bar entrance. Dustin tells me to get ready to run when he says. The people sitting at the table next to us loudly ask us what the hell we’re doing. The bar tender looks up when he hears this, and demands to know what we are doing crawling around on the floor. Everyone in the entire bar is now looking at us. “Hey!” Screams one of the girls who probably eats a bucket of Crisco for breakfast each morning. “Suzy, it’s that asshole who stuck us with the tab!”  “Run!” Dustin screamed at me, and he dashed out the door, with me on his heels. We took off down the street, and I cold hear those two beasts lumbering after us. “Jesus Christ! What is this!?” I screamed at Dustin.  He didn’t answer me, and ducked down an alleyway. The two cows were still thundering along behind us, but they were breathing heavy and starting to slow down. One of them screamed at us, “You fucking jackass! We want our fucking money back! We’ll find you!”  That was probably one of the most exciting nights of my life. We eventually lost them by doubling back to where we had come from, and Dustin agreed to explain what had just happened back at his apartment. We got in a cab, and 15 minutes later, we were sitting together on his leather couch.  Apparently, Dustin was at a bar one night, and hadn’t eaten anything for dinner yet, but had found he had blown all his money on drinks. So, he decided to bum it off some un-expecting woman, who turned out to be Humpty Dumpty #1 and #2. He figured two women such as themselves would not turn down a dinner invitation. And while he was at it, he might as well take them out to a really expensive restaurant. It’s not like he would be paying.  So they all arrive at this restaurant, the two chicks feeling like hot shit having picked adorable Dustin. Dustin orders the most expensive thing on the menu, telling the girls to do the same. He gets the finest wine the restaurant has to offer too. The girls are very impressed. Dustin is secretly laughing inside. Throughout the entire dinner, Dustin mumbles rude comments at them, and then when they asked what he had said, he made up something weirdly polite and flattering. Some of my favorites were:  - Do you rub shortening your thighs? What? I said you have sherry colored eyes. - How am I supposed to find your vagina in that sea of fat? Huh? I said I don’t even have to use Viagra to get it up like that. - Your face reminds me of Oscar the Grouch. What was that? You’re so radiant. You shouldn’t slouch. - You’re so obese you waddle. Excuse me? Your beauty is obsolete. You should model.  And so on.  When they finished eating, the two girls went off to the bathroom, telling Dustin to watch their purses for them. Bad idea girls. As soon as they were out of site, he grabbed their purses, removed the cash from their wallets, and simply left, leaving them with the outrageous bill.  I laughed so hard I was in pain. Then we had sex again. We ended up dating on and off for the next year and a half. So clearly, if you want a long, healthy relationship, make sure you fuck on the first date. But this is only wisdom from an alcoholic.

        I'll have a new story posted soon. This one's a long one, and I'm too lazy to finish right now. And someone keeps telling me to go have a drink. And I can't disobey.

        After that first douse of altered consciousness, things quickly progressed. There were a few boring days between my first drink and my next, so I won't go into detail here. Although, I will say that I lay in bed most of the time. This is because the right side of my head had swollen up to about twice the size of the left side, and my neck could no longer support it. Personally, I think I looked sexy. And you should always agree with an alcoholic.          About a week later, after my head had shrunken back down to about normal size, my good friend, Jess, shows up in my bedroom at 10 o'clock in the morning. 10-FUCKING-O'CLOCK. That is just not right. That is cruel and wrong. But I was too groggy and my mouth was to full of flem to point this out to her.           She burst through my door, screaming and giggling like an insane woman on crack. Then she proceeds to jump up and down on my bed in attempt to receive my attention. I roll over and flip her the middle finger. She ignores this. She pulls off the covers. SHE TAKES MY PILLOW. I am forced to sit up. Blood rushes to my head. And then it starts throbbing a little. Jess laughs and says I look like a used up whore. I look in the mirror. I do indeed look like a used up whore.          "GUESS WHAT!?" She shrieks. I pretend not to have heard her question and start untangling my prostitute looking hair.           "Humph. Well you're no fun."           I know.          Then she begins to tell me anyway about what she has gotten so excited over. Apparently, Brian, who is a year older than us, has gotten us invited to a SENIOR PARTY. A COOL senior party at that. Let me tell you, I was in hysterics over this. Now that I think about it, they weren't even technically seniors yet. It was still summer vacation. And they were still lowly Juniors. Oh well. The party is the next night. I agree to go. Afterall, there is bound to be alcohol there.          The next night, at 7 o'clock, I wave goodbye to my parents and assure them I am off to have some good clean fun. I walk over to Jess's house where we are going to get ready for the party. We spend an hour getting dressed in ugly 90's clothes that we thought were hot, and putting on eachother's ugly 90's makeup. At least the 90's were good for something...The Spice Girls and "Girl Power!" Brain and Megan come to pick us up in Brian's pimp mobile, AKA, station wagon. We arrive in style.          Once at the party, I quickly head towards the coolers overflowing with ice chips and beer. I crack open my first beer and take a long sip. I quickly discover that I am not a beer person, but I finish it anyway, because who wants to waste alcohol? Think of all the people going through withdrawal in China.           I go on a a mission to find hard liquor. I have lost Megan, Brian, and Jess in the crowed somewhere, but I don't mind. Just as long as I find that liquor. I find my way into the dining room. For some reason, no one is in there. I look around, figuring that since my parents have a liquor cabinet in the dining room, they must too. No such luck.          I weave my way back into the mass of horny, sweaty teenagers. Someone taps me on the shoulder and says, "Whatcha lookin' for sweetie?" I turn around and see that a fairly hot guy with no shirt on is trying to talk to me. I stare at his amazing stomach muscles for about five minutes before he asks me if I want some pot. "Uh, no thanks. I just want liquor." Nothing can deter me from my mission, not even the mystery of drugs.           "Well," said the guy, "I can show you where that is." I follow him down some stairs and into the basement. The lights down here are dim, and this is clearly where all the couples come to hook up. And then I see it. Over in the corner, made of gleaming, mahogany wood, is a bar. A real BAR. The guy with no shirt slides behind the counter and asks me what I would like. I decide to try whisky. I like it. A lot. It burns. Twenty minutes later, and there is decidedly less whisky in the whisky bottle. I end up making out with "Shirtless Dude" on the floor. He tries to take off my pants. I kick him in the groin. He curses me and leaves. I grab the rest of the whisky and start drinking it straight from the bottle.          Jess comes down the stairs and finds me laying on the floor. She tells me not to be selfish and grabs the whisky bottle from me. This pisses me off, but I'm starting to feel gross, and don't feel like moving.           Sometime later, I found myself upstairs again, drinking another beer. I'm too fucked at this point to even taste it. Waves of nausea keep washing ove me, but I keep taking sips from my beer. The room seems very large and echoey. I must have looked pretty messed up, because Megan and Brian spot me across the room and come rushing over to me as fast as they can.           "Jasmine, do you feel sick?"          "Of course she does! Look at her fucking face!"          "How much have you had to drink? Jasmine?"          "We better get her to a toilet before she hurls."          I try to tell them that I'm fine, that I'm certainly not going to puke, but they don't listen. They start dragging me towards the bathroom. About a foot from the bathroom door, I let it lose all over the back of some poor girls head. In fact, I spew my insides out over everyone within a ten foot radiance of me. I can see puke dripping down the walls. Brain looks nervously around, then picks me up, slings me over his back, and runs out the back door before anyone can realize what the hell just happened. Megan comes running out after us. It's about this point that I black out. I don't know what happened between the time someone lay me down in the backseat of the station wagon and when I woke up the next morning only to throw up all over again, this time on my bed.           Later, I called Megan and asked her what happened. She said I kept moaning and asking for more alcohol. I asked her if she gave me any. There was a disgusted silence, and then she hung up.           All I can say is, my parents certainly raised me well. Here's to childhood stories.

        I had my first real drink at the precious age of 15. I don't remember when I said my first word, or when I took my first step, but I remember when I took my first drink. Now I am a full blown alckie. But, please, don't feel bad for me. I am one fucking happy alcoholic. In my opinion, alcoholism is highly underrated. I am sure there are many who agree whole heartedly with me.  It was only a few days after my birthday. It was the day before New Year's Eve, and being that I lived in New Jersey where there is nothing worthwhile to do, I went miniature golfing with a few friends. This is the day I fell in with the bad crowed. This is the day my future became a wasted (heh heh) existence. This is the day my life truly began. I discovered alcohol.  I hate miniature golfing. My friends hate miniature golfing. But we went anyway. We each picked out a golf club and fought over who got what color ball. Because it really mattered. But Brian, an incredibly hot guy who I wanted to rape and who was dating my best friend, brought his own enema golf club. Those things are a lot bigger than your average miniature golf club, take note.  So we get to the first hole, and I am already regretting the fact that I came. I really really hate miniature golf. I would rather toss grandpa's salad than play miniature golf. But then, Praise the Lord for big purses, Megan whips out, what is it? Why yes, two water bottles filled almost completely with Everclear vodka. A good choice for my first adventure into the world of drunken stupidity. But there was something else mixed in with it too, I know this because it was red. I couldn't taste it though.  And suddenly, a few swigs later, miniature golf is fun. In fact, I find myself wishing I could play it ever fucking day of my life. Before we're on to the sixth hole, the first bottle is completely empty. The five of us are feeling pretty damn good. It takes me twenty swings at my happy red ball before I actually get it in the hole. We move on. And this is where things get really good. I'm surprised I ever got to progress into being the alcoholic that I am. I'm surprised I didn't just curse alcohol off for the rest of my life.  It's Brian's turn. Little did I know, Brian had been drinking before we got together, and was already buzzed before the Everclear. Now he's feeling even better. He decides, in his drunken state, to act like today's Tiger Woods, and whips his enema golf club back behind his head. Now I had been drinking. For my first time. And my reaction time has slowed down. I see that huge club swinging back, headed straight for my face, but instead of moving, all I can do is stare at it in wonder.  FUHHHH-WHACK!  Blinding pain explodes in my head. I black out. Slap! I fall into the stupid little pond you have to try so carefully not to hit your golf balls into. I lay there stunned for a second. I can hear my head throbbing. Then, being the pathetic chick that I am, I passed out again. I guess someone dragged me out, because then I found myself lying on the miniature golf course. Everyone seems to think it is pretty funny. They are giggling insanely. There is blood running down the side of my face. I scream at them loudly to get help. Good thing I never slurr my speach, no matter how much alcohol I consume. I remember thinking I was going to die, and that my mom would be mad at me.  One of the kids working there ends up driving me to the hospital. And to make things worse, on the way there, he brutally raped me. Just joking, that part never happened. Too bad. Anyway, it turns out that I only need three stitches, but this is a scary thing to me still because I have never had stitches before. And I am drunk. And not exctly sure of what is going on.  After the they finish stitching me up, I get up, walk out, and manage to find my way home. I managed to keep my parents from ever finding out about the incident, thus, they are unable to stop me on my path towards self-destruction. Thank God.
