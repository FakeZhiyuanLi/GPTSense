        Oh man am I tired! Last night Jeena had a sleep over at the Best Western and we didn't go to sleep until 7. But then we woke up at nine so it wasn't really sleep. Well me and Liz didn't get there until 10 or so because we had to work. Work sucked, Adam was being dumb and Eric was being funny, like he always is. But back to the party. We got there at 10 and we couldn't find anyone for a while so we went up to the room and some people were sittin up there and we went back downstairs and there's like 15 girls sitting in the lobby. We watched the Olympics for quite sometime. But when the guys left we all went back upstairs. Well we were jumping back and forth from mattress to mattress. And we put one mattress up against the wall so we could run and jump into it and just kinda fall onto the bed. It was a good time.  But after that me and Megan were kinda wanting to run around the halls. So we did, but then we were wanting to knock on peoples doors and run....so we did. Lmao, when we were running down the hallway once we saw a scary looking guy and its in my natural instinct to scream, but that was dumb. But we ran back to the room and figured he would be gone soon so we went back out in like 10 minutes. Well we're running down the hall way and we turn the corner and that guy is there AGAIN! Well this time I didnt scream lol. He ended up being a guy that worked there and told us he was hearing complaints about people running in the halls and loud talking. So we got yelled at but oh well thats the point in staying in a hotel.  Then about an hour later all hell breaks lose and of course people get in fights. Wrong things were said. I wanted to say somethin to two people but didnt because it would just make things worse, so I just kinda sat back and watched people go at it. But that's what happens when 18 girls are out in two rooms.  Then at 6 am we go down and eat breakfast. At this point I was so tired bc I hadn't slpet at all. So we go eat breakfast and I had a bowl of froot loops and a bowl of rice krispes with A TON if sugar!! We were walkin back up to the room and me Jess and Ashley saw this weird lookin guy comin down the stairs. Well I get scared, look at him, and run up the steps and I fell and hit my head on the the wall. And I dont know why but I was singing skunk in the barnyard like all morning and ashley said I sounded drunk but I didn't think I was that bad.  And we all got locked out of one of the rooms because somebody locked the door and the metal thing that goes over it too. Man whoever did that is a retard! Well Im watchin the Olympics so I cant really watch and write at the same time So I'll write later  -Bye

       Today I went to the teen ministry rummage sale at St. Pete's. It was alot of fun!! We didn't really do much of anything except eat pizza, rollerblade, and urban sledding....With a mattress lol. Well at first it wasn't much fun because I thought we would actually have to work or something, but we didn't really do anything at all. Me and Kyle bought a mattress for 5 bucks, lmao and we slid down the church stairs with it. And Simon bought a sled and used it for the stairs too. HAHA and Ben put those shoes on that turn into roller blades and was in the parking lot and he was hanging on to my arm and I started running and he fell flat on his face in the parking lot! Lmao, he was okay though. And then we all walked down to true wheel because Simon and Ben wanted to look at skateboarding stuff and after that me and Ben went to quiznos. While we were in there he was being so stupid so I hit him in the arm and he looked at me and screamed "Amy that really hurt!!!" and he fell on the ground lol. Then he asked the lady behind the counter to tell me to stop touching him.  everyone else hates there church because they don't do anything fun. Well I love St. Peters because we have so much fun and the coolest people go there! Ben, Simon, Megan, JB, Ashley, Tony. And yeah we just have so much fun when were all together. Like today was one of the funnest times I've had in a long time. Well so was last night but today was better.  When we came in from urban sledding, me Simon and megan ran the bake sale LOL. We had a total of two people buy something. And we played topple and colored and talked about homecoming and our favorite bands. And now I have a date to homecoming! :) Yes, Its Ben. That will be a lot of fun.  Well I gotta go get ready for work and get my stuff ready for Jeenas huge ass sleepover! So I'll tty people later. Peace

      Well today was fun! I had to wake up at 8:15 though for my physical. But when I got home I slept until 2 so its all good. Tonite was one of the funnest nights I have had in a looooong time! I went to see Without a Paddle with Ben, Jessica, and Ashley. That's one of the funniest movies I seen in a long time. But Ben wouldn't shutup so I missed part of the movie. Lmao, Ben was sitting next to these "hot" girls (they were really ugly but Ben thought they were hot) and he kept askin her what school she went to and if he could have her pop and her popcorn. After a while she just stopped listening to him. And then he told me this really funny joke right during the movie and I guess something funny happened in the movie and everyone else laughed and he goes "Gees people it wasn't that funny!" I guess you had to be there. But you people need to go see that movie its hilarious!  And seeing Ben was soo much fun! He really doesnt take anything seriously, like unless you really want him to then he is. But when youre like sad about something here comes ben with a funny look on his face to make you feel aaallll better! But I gave him a picture of us and he didnt have anywhere to put it so he crumbeled it up and left it in Aarons car :(  I saw Meghan Crowley tonite at the movie which is kinda weird because I was just readin her blog today But anywho Im out because I'm really tired and I have to wake up early tomorrow  -Bye-  "Popcorn is good especially when its not yours"-Ben

      I'm sitting here listening to sugarcult and that song fits so perfectly with what im thinking right now. Tonite was horrible! Not the party, Ashley and Jessica are great party throwers! ;) But the horrible part was Jordan. I knew for sure that when he had to leave I would start balling, and I did. Me and Megan were off by ourselves crying and NOBODY understood what we were thinking. Well maybe Jess did because the love of her life left her. I love you jess:) But anywho I really love JB and him leaving SA makes it so much worse. I mean I know I will get to see him and stuff, but not being with him through school is just really hard to think about. Jordan was one of my bestfriends and always had something to say to make you feel so much better! And him not being around as often is weird. But tonite I gave him a hug and I just let it all out and I couldnt stop crying! I told him I loved him and I didnt want him to go, but theres nothin you can do right? And he told me everything would be okay and he would see me all the time. I think people think I'm a freak and I'm over-reacting but to all of you who think that FUCK YOU! Well JB I love you! And you, me and megan are gonna hang out all the time.  And Me Jess and Ben made a pact to hang out twice a month! Ben gave me a typewriter in the grass, and punched me in the boobular!! That jerk. But I still love you ben :) Ben's gonna be a fat ass in a couple of years. God he comes home from school and tells me that he had a hamburger, fries and chickenstrips for lunch. Then tonite at the party he had like a fucking whole bag of chips and the whole bowl of dip. And Ben I miss you already too :( And we have had so many good times! Lol theres way too many to count! I love you! But okay enough about the two people who I love and dont want to leave! And once again you who think im over re-acting FUCK YOU!  Wednesday night me and Tony stayed up til like 1 am playing games on Ebaums and he kicked my ass at ALL of them! Bowling, golfing, helicopter, drunk walking! You name it he beat me. But it was still kinda fun. And I demand a rematch tony!  Homecoming, Aaron asked me to go....I said I didnt know because right now Im pissed because all he wanted to do tonite was fuckin make out or whatever. WHILE I was crying over Jordan leaving! I said "Aaron if one of your BEST friends just left you, would you want to go get with some girl?" Well that was a fuckin dumb question. His answer? yes. Well hes not a chick and doesnt have all the emotional shit goin on right now. But anywho, Homecoming, I dont want to think about it, its too far away.  Okay now today is Friday, Everything before this paragraph was written on Thursday. Just thought I'd let you know so I didnt confuse you all. Well tomorrow (Saturday) I am going to this Teen Ministry rummage sale at church. It will be fun, basically because I will get to see Jordan and Ben. And then after that I am going school shopping :( In a way I am kinda excited for school to start but I wont be after the first couple of days.  Last night Jordan was telling me and jess these stories about LC and how much fun he is having. And all I could do was stand there and look at him and want to kick his ass! But there was one funny story about a kid asking somehting about a do do bird. lol ask JB about it. And today I got my pictures back! From last night, yeah that was pretty fast but I wanted them back! Some of them are good but Becca doesnt know how to take pictures and some peoples heads were cut off! lol I still love you becca meade! :)  Well thats enough for now. Hope you enjoy this ashley!

       Today I woke up at 1:00 again. But Tiffany left for Chicago this morning at 5 and woke me up to say goodbye. I wanted to get up and give her a hug, but it was to ealry and I couldnt move. So I got up again at 1 and ate 3 bowls of cereal and watched tv. Thats pretty much what I do every morning though. When I was watching TV, road rules was on and it was like a marathon from the first episode. And Danny was on there. You know for a gay guy hes pretty hot.      Anywho, last night I went to Marc's house. It was a pretty fun time. We were watching the olympics and audrey flipped out because michael phelps was on...he is pretty hot though. And Asia gave me one of those LIVE   STRONG  bracelets, thank you asia:) At the beginning of the party all the girls were sitting on the floor saying all the funny stuff that happened last year and what we're going to miss most. And the most we talked about was Ms. Bias's class and how everyone gave her so much shit and she would just stand there with  her hands on her hips and stare at you. And we hid the clock from her and put in Ben's trapper. And Joe would run around the room like an ape and she immitated him once and the whole class started laughing and she looked like she wanted to cry.      Lmao, last night Cody called Jareds cell phone and left a message in a deep voice saying it was Bob and he wanted to know why he never called him back. Lol we pranked a lot of people last night. Matt and Aaron were playing baseball in Marcs basement and surprisingly they didnt break anything. But Jessica and Ashley got hit in the face a few times. Well our class knows how to throw a party.      I'm going to go watch That 70's show so I'll write in here later.      (This thing is addicting!)

       Haha I just saw that commercial. Its pretty addictive when you start singing it. Kinda like alot of other annoying   songs. Today was full of a whole bunch of nothing. I woke up at 1:00 and then I had four bowls of froot loops :) Tiffany had Marty and Katie over today. Katie is hilarious. She works at a nursing home and she told me this story once about how this old guy asked her if he had grain under his chair and she said she wanted to turn around and say 'no, freak!' lol so she told him there might be but she wasnt sure.      Today I found out that Aaron likes Shelby again. And we both agreed that when school started we would try the whole dating thing again and that we wouldnt have any boyfriends or girlfriends. Well I guess that's ruined. He told me every day how he didnt like her and that he would never go out with her. But I guess he wouldnt have talked about her so much if he didnt like her. But I dont know what to do about him anymore. And I'm not writing this so you people will feel sorry for me, I just need some way to get this all out.      Lately my sister has been yelling at me for almost everything I do. I try and talk to her and she just walks away like shes better than me or whatever. I'll ask her to borrow something and shes like fuck no! and then she takes anything of mine knowing it will piss me off but she doesnt care. Even my mom says lately shes been bitchy and shes never acted like this before. She stays out passed her cerfew sometimes and then her and my mom yell at eachother. Its kinda annoying after a while. And when she moves out its not going to be the same because up until now we have always hung out together or talked about everything together.      Well Road Rules is on So I'll write in this later probably tomorrow.      bye

      Man I am tired! I had to work last night from 5-10:30, and then at Liz's house we didnt go to bed until 4:00. Yeah and last night we talked to this kid on the phone that Liz knows from LC named Mike and he was drunk. lmao like every 20 seconds he would say "hey....who is this?" lol it was funny. And he called me dawg alot too.  Today me and Liz went to the mall because there was nothing better to do. And we really only looked at homecoming dresses and tried like 15 of them on. And i got fuckin glitter all over! Oh then I saw meagan huerter at the mall today, man I miss her so much. I mean we havent talked in so long and in 7th grade we were BEST friends! And she only lives 5 minutes away and we still havent talked in like forever. I told her to call me sometime so we could hangout. And it seems like when Ben and Jordan leave I'm never going to see them and that makes me want to cry because nothing is more important to me then my friends. And JB said he didnt want to hear or think of me crying....well next time I see you, you better be prepared buddy.  Melanne called me a couple of days ago and told me that her little sister Nicole might have that one disease you get from ticks...lime disease or whatever. I hope to God she doesnt have it because that would be horrible. I wouldnt know what to do because Melannes house is like my second home and her family is like my second family, so I hope she is going to be okay.  My great uncle passed away a couple of weeks ago. My grandma Judy went up there for the funeral because it was her brother-in-law. My mom wanted to go to the funeral but we didnt have enough time and it was in Missouri. My grandma emailed my mom about the funeral and the relatives that were there and stuff. My cousin Chad, that died last October, his mom was there and my grandma said it looked like she hadnt eaten anything in the longest time and she walks really slow now. Then theres my cousin Abby, Chads sister. She is into the drinking and partying scene ever since Chad died. They think its because she doesnt really have anyone to talk to about everything. Its so hard for me not to think about Chad. I look at his senior picture everyday and it just makes me want to cry, then I do. Then there's this country song called A few questions I have and theres a part that goes "And why did my cousin have to die in that crash? A good kid only 17" and that fits him perfectly...he died in a fourwheeling accident. His parents went to Iowa to visit my grandma and grandpa and he stayed in Missouri with his sister. He went fourwheeling with his friends and told Jen he would be back later, about an houre later she gets a call at home sayin that Chad died and there was nothin they could do and Jen had to call her mom and dad in Iowa and they had to drive all the way home knowing there was absoutely nothing they could do.  Well I cant concentrate enough to write about this anymore. Bye

       I just woke up like 20 minutes ago so If I tend to spell things wrong it's not my fault. So on this lovely little Saturday I wake up late then I get on the computer, Im always on the computer though. Maybe I'm on too much....nah. My sister always yells at me becasue I'm in the computer too much. Well she's on the phone too much and it's always long distance! Where did my mom and dad go wrong with that child? But anywho I have to work tonite at 5:00. I think I might take a nap in the bathroom for about an hour....nobody would notice. But I have to teach Eric how to bus tables. Wow busing tables, what a great job and high paying too! Ehhh scratch that, high paying my ass. But work is always fun with Liz and Adam. Adam is my body guard because theres this really scary guy at work named mark and hes 26 and he asked adam for liz's phone number and he always smiles and tries to talk to me and liz. We call him Shrek because he....looks like shrek. He laughs like the devil. And his eyes are really scary.  This summer was nothing but softball to me. I wake up and I think okay gotta get ready for softball. Softball practice was nothing but fun time to everyone. Lmao, I remember one day Meghan Crowley chased a butterfly around the field. And she got hurt like every other day. Then one day we got the pitching machine out on the field so we could give the out fielders pop flys and Jena moves the pitching machine while its running and the whole tire pops off. So that practice was basically just the whole team trying to fix the pitching machine. And you people wonder why our varsity team was so bad....because we didnt do anything in practice. But our Underwood game was awesome! They're rated third in Iowa and were probably rated last and we held them 0-0 until the sixth inning when some girl hit a homerun. The final score was 3-0, not bad.  Woo, then theres our PAL soccer team. We didnt win one game this season, and we only scored one goal all season. Thank you Janelle. But we did play select teams every game so hey give us some credit. Even though we sucked this year I am playin next year just to see what its like to actually win a couple of soccer games. And I dont know if I will stay with soccer because I'm not even very good and 8th grade was my first year playing.  I cant believe school starts in TEN DAYS! I mean seriously that was the fastest summer of my life. And whats with the whole 'you must do 40 hours of community service before you graduate' rule? St. Albert is turning into one big hell chamber for kids. And now school starts at 8:05. I know its only a five minnute difference but it seems like forever to me. And last nite I went to bed at 3:00. I mean every night I go to bed between one and three. Theres no way in hell I'm going to be able to wake up for school everyday. The only good part about school is being with your friends but it still sucks because your at school! And Mikey Burns is coming back to SA. I hope to god that he takes his medicine every day because if he doesnt I'll deck him. But he calls me like once a week to see if I want to go do something with him and he seems calm on the phone....but you never know with that kid.  Well I have to go get ready for work so thats all for today!

       Woo tonite was fun...minus the part where aaron got mad at me....wait yeah that was fun. The non-fun part was swimming...but that was basically the whole reason for the party, so thats kinda weird. But anyway to the point. Aaron....hmm he gets mad alot...at me! and he says i start it all.Yep it always me isnt it? Its kinda funny how one thing happens then guys tell the story totally different. Anyway he gets mad at me because I wasnt talking to him enough. Hmm we broke up, but me being the retarded one said we would go back out soon and thats not really what i wanted so I basically screwed myself. Okay enough about him....He will just read this and get pissed some more.      Wow I got my shedule today....Im screwed. Theres no way in hell I will pass ninth grade unless God comes down from that huge cloud and gives me a miracle. Then my mom gives me this big speach about how I can do soo much better than I did last year. Then I say "mom...what about spanish?" she tells me I will just have to float my ass through that one. Way to give me encouragement mom!       Lmao. Tonite at the party I kneed Jordan in the balls and when I go to the car my mom saw me do it and tells me that can do permanent damage, and to never do it again. HAHA I just think its hilarious to see guys go down on their knees. Kinda like Cameren on Real World. Then Me Jess and Ashley start talking about the real world and how Cameren gets drunk and makes up cheers "With the red and black socks, Frakie rocks! Go punk!" Lol thats hilarious!      I have the most ANNOYING song stuck in my head and since I am so nice and thoughtful I will get it stuck in your heads too! "Hey hey good lookin what ya got cookin? Hows about cooking somethin up with me?" Yeah I know lame, but its pretty addictive once you start singing it.       Well Im gonna go because I got nothin else to entertain you people with. And I have to work tomorrow...and eric is coming in to work for the first time and I get to teach him! WOO im excited...ehhh (sarcasim) but I love my eric! And after work Im goin to Liz's house to have a smashin time!       Okay one more thing! I was watching Leno and he starts singing this song "Im proud to be a lesbian where at least I know I'm gay" Ha i thought it was funny!      BYE!

       Next year isn't going to be the same without Ben! We had so many good times this year, mostly in Ms. Bias class. Lmao that was the best! She would yell at Ben and he would say "You just hate me because I'm black!" And she sent him to the office because it was a 'racist comment'. 8th grade seemed like one big party and ms bias class was like the after party and Ben just made it better. People say I talk about the kid too much, but you know what I dont give a rats ass because I love him! Oh and he told me to tell Ms. Bias that he left SA because of her.    Then there's Jordan...hes leaving too. Theres alot of good times I've had with him too and it just seems like alot of my good friends are leaving and I wont get to see them as much. But I guess thats what the summer and weekends are for. If Ben or Jordo are reading this I want you to know that I will miss you both! :(      Next year is going to suck...whoever thought of the rule that we have to wear shoes with backs, is a teen hating nazi! Our shoes were really the only thing we could pick out oursleves without having rules for them. Next they will probably make us wear PE unifrorms. And why does it matter if our pants have 'outside seems'? Its not like the devil created outside seems. Our school is runned by nazis, and I can see why so many damn people are leaving! But at least we wont have to sit in the damn bleachers for football games, damn you mrs foxhoven! But I'm kinda scared for high school basically because I'm a screwoff and never did my homework last year and people say that 9th grade is kinda hard. And the fact that in Mr Mehslings class he gave us the answers to assignments and tests, and we all know Kruzich's not going to do that. And I still owe that bastard mehsling 11 bucks. If I have him for study hall next year I will cry! Considering the fact that he asked me and Jessica to dance with him! I almost cried that day too.    Well I leave you with this quote from That 70s Show "I want to thank you all for being here with me and I would just like to say, When my time comes I want to be buried face down so everyone who didnt like me can kiss my ass!"

      This is my first blog so i dont really know what you people want to hear. But anywho, yesterday the teen ministry group went to Mahoney State Park. That was pretty fun, golfing was lame but there was a huge ass snake in the bushes and ashley looks at it, screams, then runs away. Matt gets yelled at for poking at it by some lady he doesnt know. lmao.  So when were done putt puttin matt makes me give him a piggy back ride up to the place where we put our putters. I get half way up the hill and fall right on my knees, and Im laughing so hard I cant get back up and Matts sitting on my back, yelling at me to get up. It was pretty funny.  We went to this tall tower type thing and this crazy fucked up girl from AL asks me if I want to practice cheerleading moves with her....i was like ummm im not a cheerleader sorry. She tells me that she got kicked off the squad because she beat some girl up bc she took her pom poms....yeah that girl was a freak.  Then we go swimming....its like 70 outside and were the only people in their pool. So me meg, matt, and simon go to the wave pool. The lifeguards blow the whistle and say adult swim. Me and megan go yeah were 18! and they believed us and let us stay.....fun stuff. Ben decides to go get pizza, and the lady at the stand said they were all out and they still have to cook it, ben looks at her and then looks at me and says "her fat ass is eating the damn pizza right now!" lmao. We leave the pool and we decide to go to the inside play place since its raining and all but of course...it was closed! So we go home early because theres nothing to do. We sit in the social hall and im thinking'great i get to go home and be a lazy ass now' but my dear friend megan asks me if I want to stay the night. She calls her mom i call my mom....she calls her mom back "Mom due to peer pressure i would like to know if a few other people can come over too?" lmao So we all go to megs house for like 4 hours. It was really fun, Ben found sex toys, Matt played with jordans boobs, me and ashley practically got raped, simon was....just being simon, Tony got made fun of by megans mom (you gotta love megans mom) So all in all it was a fun time. Me and AShley stayed the night with don don and we stayed up talking about people....pretty much everyone.  Well I have written a shit load so Im gonna go watch That 70s show!! peace out
