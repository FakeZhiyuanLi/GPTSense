      Last night was R's bachelorette party. Approx 20 women camping in the Los Gatos hills with a huge hot tub, fire pit, kitchen &amp; patio area. Tons of food, beautiful &amp; comfortable a-frame cabins, games, rituals, gossip, drama, and foot masks. Rebecca, Amy, Rita, Candace, Jewelz, Jooo, Michelle, Joyce, Shari, Biddy, Lisa,&nbsp;Kate, Karie, Jen, Tammi, Jan, Artemis, am I missing anyone? This isn't flowing well because I have something else on my mind. &nbsp; Before I left, Felix &amp; I came up with a list of questions about his law school applications. We planned to meet this evening after Haley goes to bed, around 8:30, to discuss what he learned. I kept my word and left the party early to come home by noon so he could go for a ride with "the guys." He hadn't had a chance to work on the law school stuff because, he said, "Haley was up till nearly 9pm last night," (okay, that's actually typical so, um, whatever), "and she was up at 6am this morning," and I don't think he would've gotten anything done on it &nbsp;if she'd slept till 8, so how does that effect it? When he &amp; his buddy were leaving, S said, "So, I'll have him back around 7 or so." Um, Hello?!?! It was 1:00! With H's bedtime an hour later, that meant he won't get his work done and will, again, have done nothing about his applications. &nbsp; So, forget it. I kept up my end of the bargain and got back here on time. He didn't get his work done and we won't be having our meeting tonight. I have put in several hours towards his law school app, and he hasn't. So I am done. I'm not going to be passive aggressive, I am not going to be mad, I am not going to play games. I'm also not going to be involved. If he wants to do this, he's going to have to do it on his own. I will not assist him, push him, advise him. I'm stepping aside and keeping out of it. If he really wants to do this, maybe he will. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

      I've avoided blogs up to this point.  &nbsp;  I thought they were boring, trite, ridiculous. Like I really want to read about your fucking cat? Your boring job? A friend found out her boyfriend was going to dump her by reading his public blog. Isn't that why little girl's diaries have keys and locks?  &nbsp;  Well, anyway, I've always been one for experimentation, so here goes...  &nbsp;  Hi, I'm Absinthia. I've been called that since April Fool's Day 1997, when I made a couple of bottles of absinthe and wore a beautiful green beaded gown (borrowed from ATC's closet) in a green velvet hallway in Port Costa. It's all Hernan's fault. It usually is.  &nbsp;  Those glamorous days are now somewhat in the past, though we try to relive them from time to time. I've been married to Felix now for over 4 years, and Haley turned two at the end of May. This evening, we've returned early from a Parent's of the Oakland Zoo (POZ) party, celebrating the fact that we raised over $12,000 for the zoo at their annual fundraiser, Walk in the Wild. That was actually a really fun event. I dressed up and worked the silent auction table. Many of the items were contacts that I had made. I found that, like sales, I have a knack for calling people up and getting them to give me things. It was fun! After my shift that evening, this bizarre docent chick &amp; I walked around together, as her boyfriend and my husband weren't there. We drank, flirted with waiters, ate, and she told me all about how much she loves really ugly birds. What a freak! Later, a POZ member gave me a ride back to my car and asked my why my license plate says **Abs. I told her the first part was for Felix, the second for Haley, and the Abs...and fortunately&nbsp;I got cut off and we never got there.  &nbsp;  That's been the weirdest part of motherhood for me. It used to be so cut and dried. At work and with my family I was Jennifer, with everyone else Absinthia. Now I can barely remember when I am who! I find myself explaining the absinthe thing to people who just don't need to go there. And people who don't need to know my real name learn it. Oh well, like someone once told me, I am multi-faceted. I guess that's better than being accused of having multi-personalities!  &nbsp;  When we returned home from the bbq this evening, Felix said he was expecting to have no fun at all and was happy to say that was not true. I don't think Haley would agree. I think she's getting her 2 yr molars, poor thing was so cranky, clingy, and miserable. She's asleep right now. I hope it's the teeth and it goes quickly for her. I'm off to an overnight bachelorette party tomorrow and it would suck if Felix had to deal with her on his own.  &nbsp;  Now that the house is quiet, I'm going to go upstairs and read or perhaps watch a movie. I am reading Dale Carnegie's  How to Make Friends and Influence People  (required reading for work), Bob Woodworth's  Plan of Attack  (my first political book), and I really want to start the  Piano Tuner .  &nbsp;  Abs
