      It's nice to be off work!  Although, I read 2 things that disturbed me today...  One was an email from an acquaintance talking about how the US might start drafing young people to the army and my son falls within the age range.  Another was my boss's sermon talking about how his son is in the reserves and he's been called to active duty in Iraq... it makes me want to cry.

      It's my mom and niece's birthday today, so my son and I will be making a trip to visit them.  Life seems too busy and stressful right now.. so much to do... taking next week off work so whenever i'm preparing to be gone, theres double to do before i leave.  finances are sucking too.  someone from church that was really special to me died yesterday. it makes me really sad. i have a note on my desk to send her a getwell card, and the note had been there a week at least :(( this lady prayed for me and my family every day for a long long time. i really really need to be better about at least sending cards

      i am soooo bored at work. i guess i should think of something to do to keep busy, then the day would go faster and then i wouldn't be so bored... i'll do that tomorrow :) i was very pissed last night, i came home, took a nap... before that i set the dvr thing to record the 2 south park episodes, and started to record sex and the city... then thought, i'll be awake from my nap by then... guess what?  i was awake, but got busy chatting and thought... i'll just watch it later since i'm recording it... so later gets here, and i go to watch it, and its not there cause i didn't record it!@#$ so now i have the next weeks set to record :)

      nothing exciting on monday... except i had a really bad dream last night :( i usually dont remember dreams, maybe i remembered that one cause it was so bad.  today is fairly busy... staff meeting, then after work the staff goes to the vestry meeting.. first time in the almost 18 years i've been here, that i've been invited to that!  not sure i'm looking forward to it, cause the changes we've recently made, i cant say i was or am all for them. then the best part of today, kasha celebrates 1 year clean tonight.  :)

      I did some yard work late yesterday afternoon. I swear it was only about 40 minutes, but I am so sore today.   Didn't get enough sleep last night so tried to nap today, but still don't feel rested. FINALLY GOT A GMAIL INVITE THIS WEEK... and already got 3 invites to give to friends... yay! its nice, its going to be hard changing from eudora to a web based email, but i'll give it a try. i've always given people such a hard time for using those free emails like hotmail, yahoo etc... i feel like a hypocrit.

      One day closer to vacation being over... I have a long list of things to do that I haven't done yet! I did enjoy watching Day after Tomorrow yesterday, even though the review I read after the fact wasn't very good.   Let's hope I get everything done I need to do today.

      Only 4 more days of vacation. :( I still haven't done one thing in the yard or house like I intended. Plan on going to lunch and a movie with a friend today.... much better way to spend vacation than house or yard work!

      Ok, I was pretty lazy yesterday.  I didn't go to the meeting, only ran a few errands and slept and watched tv and irc'd for the rest of the day. Today I do have plans to go visit someone sick and help someone install a printer.  I SHOULD get out and work in my little yard. My neighbor has fixed hers up so cute, and mine is pretty shabby looking.  But I have no motivation at all to do yard work. :(

      Stayed up really late last night watching movies - watched the rest of Grey Zone, which was a really sad movie about WWII and watched another one I can't even think of.... wow my memory is really bad! No plans for the day except pay bills and maybe go to a movie this afternoon.  Should do something useful like do housecleaning - but don't hold your breath! Maybe I'll go to a noon meeting.

      i dont want to go back to work tomorrow! i feel kinda sick too, like i'm coming down with a sinus infection, but maybe it was all the dust and cat hair from when i changed the vacuum cleaner bag yesterday (like anyone really cares!)  3 funerals while i was on vacation, and 1 the week before.  its really sad.  lisa's was the saddest.  mr peytons was pretty impressive. there were probably 500+ people there.  i was surprised they had alcohol at the 'reception' afterwards.  but oh well.  no one asked me!
