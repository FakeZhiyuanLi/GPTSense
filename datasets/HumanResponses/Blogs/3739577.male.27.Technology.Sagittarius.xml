       Its been a long time since my last post, i quit my job. and i am now a professional slacker. Somtimes i feel that i don't seem to be suited to working, but due to life's needs and demands, work is what i need to do. So.....i recently signed up for relief teaching to pass the time and get some income.I met this lady on the MRT today. She was a Malaysian coming to Singapore to study Make Up in a Cosmetic school here. She was pretty(SMIRK),singularly suited to the profession of Make up artiste or lady or person whatever you call them. She got me thinking.....   So many Foreigners, Burmese,Chinese,Thais,Malaysians,Indonesians etc etc all come to our country to study and hopefully find work. What pushes them to come here? Money ? Safety ? A Better Lifestyle ? But alot of them i talk to, At least those who have been here for more then 3 years want to go back to their home country. At the same time i notice alot of Singaporeans intending or already have migrated to Australia Canada UK USA Thailand and even China(Interestingly Indonesia was never mentioned as a destination of choice SMIRK). in a recent article in the Sunday times, Retirees migrating to China were profiled. IN most cases the strength of the Singapore dollar was cited as a reason why they went there so that their pension would last longer. While those who came to Singapore cited the Strong dollar as a reson they came over, so that their earning power would be magnified manifold.   It just seems to me that lots of people are moving here and there for survival and for better prospects. Its good to have immigrants- they liven and invigorate the country's economy,work force, cultural and population composition. Furthermore, as long as the countries' governments are selective about the quality of inmmigrants, they are a gain and not a drain on the country. i notice that this is happening on a global scale- from the former eastern bloc to western europe, from south america to north america from all parts of South East Asia to Australia.     Sets you thinking doesn't it ? ~_~........HMMMMMMM....                        Whats the point of all these talk? Nothing Much like i said i am now a professional slacker. And Slackers just TALK..... lol thanks for paying attention.
