      So here's my first blog.  Why do I want a blog?  To be famous?  To let the world know my inner thoughts and dreams?  Wait, doesn't everyone start their blog like this?  I refuse.  I will give the simple answer.  I simply feel my ideas are too great to be left unnoticed.  Therefore, I will give this site addres only to friends and family and other people who I know will give me positive encouragement and reenforcement, because as they all know, I am a sucker for that type of thing.  If you are stumbling across this because you found a link on a message board, then welcome.  I hope you enjoy my thought process and rantings and please do stay longer next time.  If you think I'm being pretentious and tacky, just remember what Jesus said, "If you can't say something nice, don't say it at all".  That's good advice to live by, if I do say so myself.  Anyway, this should be fun.  I will be witty, and interesting, and thought provoking, and sometimes provocative just to throw something into the mix every once in a while.  Expect to be shocked, amazed, enthralled, (insert your own word here), and a better person once you're done reading this.  So here we go.  Let the journey begin and let us all be enlightened together.  Please note, I am only a moderatly good speller, but you should ignore my mistakes and simply focus on that brilliance of the word I meant, not what I actually said.  In fact, that's good advice for life as well.  It has started.   Peace

      	It’s that time of year.  You know the time.  When it’s so dadgum hot outside that you decide to skip the nice weather and spend a few hours of your day inside an air- conditioned dark room.  That’s right, it’s Summer Movie Time!  This year has been a banner year for Summer Movies.  Mostly that is due to the fact that I have actually had time this summer to go see them, so therefore, it has been a banner year.  See my logic.  So here are some reviews for all of you who couldn’t make it out to many flicks this summer.  Thanks Nick…  Spiderman 2 – I wish I was Spiderman.  Mostly because I wish I could fit into clothes that tight and had the Super Spider Vision (ah ha…. That’s where I left my keys!).  Maybe this is why I liked this movie so much.  I guess it’s just the part of me that really wants to go around using funny one-liners in ordinary everyday situations.  Oh yeah…and the part of me that wants people to tell me “Go get ‘em Tiger” during ordinary conversation.  Like when I’m taking the trash out….  Me: I’m taking the trash out.  Mary: Go get ‘em Tiger.  Or when I’m making coffee.  Me: I’m making coffee.  Mary: Go get ‘em Tiger.   That would be awesome!  The Bourne Supremacy – Matt Damon is awesome.  Here’s a guy who is a certified genius at MIT, a gay schizophrenic in the 1950’s in Europe, Greg Kinear’s Siamese twin, and now a bad a$$ super agent who can’t remember who he is but decides to go around and kill some people that he doesn’t like.   Unfortunately for The Bourne Supremacy, watching it is kind’ve like sitting through two hours of shaky home movies…except it would be like James Bond’s home movies.  I just feel sorry for the ushers who have to clean up the vomit from all of the people who sat in the first ten rows.  Fahrenheit 9/11 – Republicans = bad!  Democrats  = sometimes bad but not as bad as Republicans!  Now watch this drive!  I, Robot – You know Will Smith is talented when he can make the same movie four times.  This should really be called “I, Robot in Black on Independence Day”.  Harry Potter – I liked this movie a lot.  Maybe it just reminded me of my awkward adolescent years when I was trying to deal with my parents being killed by an evil wizard while running away from a escaped prisoner while these creepy ghost things kept trying to steal my soul.  Oh, for the good old days...  King Arthur – I try to stay away from crap.  Dodgeball – Funniest movie I’ve seen this year.  I wish I could get away with using that much inappropriate humor in an hour and a half.  Yeah, and f*** Chuck Norris!  Catwoman – See King Arthur.  And the award for most long awaited movie of the summer goes to…….  The Village – Life simply does not have enough surprise endings.  That’s why we like M. Night.  If we could end everyday of our lives with some awesome twist…say, like we’re actually dead and didn’t know it, or our parents are actually evil super hero villains, or your boss can be killed with ordinary tap water…then we wouldn’t need M. Night.  Unfortunately, our pants all go on one leg at a time, therefore, I can’t wait for the Village.  Well, I hope this helps you to choose the appropriate theatre to enter in order to waste two hours of your life.  Of course, I guess, if you really wanted to just waste a few more hours of your life on stupid, mind numbing consumerist entertainment, you could just keep reading this blog.  Either way is fine with me.

      The Top Ten Reasons to Quit Your Christian Band:  10. Because you'll never be Third Day, and really, why would you want to be.  9. Because you don't like living three years in the past.  8. Because all your Christian band friends think Creed is so cool.  7. Because walking humbly with the Lord is hard in front of a thousand screaming gilrs.  6. Because you've caught yourself twice trying to grow the Youth Pastor goatee.  5. Because you get all those requests for "Big House".  4. Because nothing is as satisfying as having a "Christian" record label steal money from you.  3. Because the Christian movie industry looks so much more lucrative (I mean, did you see the "Left Behind" films!?).  2. Because it's a little easier being a drug addict or alcoholic in secular music.  1. Because you're gay and you're moving to San Francisco.

      I think my favorite wacked out Bible prophecy is the rapture.  I mean, really, it takes some Donald Trump like class to preach to somebody on the rapture.  First of all, nothing gives a big "f**k you" to non-Christians like the rapture.  Just think about it.  What if a Budhist convinced you that all the little Budhist people will be zapped up into buddha's belly one day, leaving all the non-budhhits here on earth with the job of trying to figure out what the sound of one hand clapping is.  I don't know about you, but I might need to change my drawers.  The rapture is the best scare tactic of all times in Christianity (although I slept through the Crusades, so I'm not sure what that was like).  And if you're trying to tell a non-Christian about the rapture and they just aren't getting you, just remind them of all the Christians that will be driving cars and flying airplanes when the rapture happens.  Then, sit back and watch as they nervously leave you and start trying to avoid busy interstates.  And of course, if that doesn't do it, then remind them of how, somewhere in the Bible, there's that whole thing about non-Christians being tortured, for like, a thousand years, or something, you know, where the scorpians sting them, and like the beast marks them, and stuff.  You know, it's like, totally, in like, Revelation, and like the Bible, and stuff.  You know, with the dragon, in the same book with all those Left Behind people, you know, in the Bible.  Yeah, that will really show 'em.    And if they still don't want to believe you and the legitimacy of the rapture, then you should just remind them what the Lake of Fire is going to be like, because you know, that is most definitly what Jesus would do.  So, here's my plea to non-Christians, if there happen to be any that are reading this, or just Christians who also feel like taking the wool off.  I propose we come up with an "Anti-Rapture".  This is the prophecy in the Bible (you know...probably in Daniel, or something) where it says all the Christians will be left on earth when Jesus comes back, and not only that, the earth will be invaded by hundreds of thousands of dead government officials, atheist sex therapists, and late 70's TV characters.  They will all be led by the triune of Richard Nixon, Dr. Ruth, and Archie Bunker.  They will rule for a thousand years before their term ends or the reruns start.  It will be a perilous time for all dispensationalists, and just think of all those 70's famous people that will be driving cars (think "Smokey and the Bandit" and I bet you can really scare some Christian folks).  So start preaching people!  If we are ever to take the lead on bad theology we must start now!  There is no time to waste.  Remember what Jesus said, "When you point a finger at someone, you've got three fingers pointing back at you."  Now, that just makes a lot of sense doesn't it.

      It's been a tough year for people who like to use the internet to steal things.  First the RIAA starts suing people for downloading music.  It's a sad day when an 83 year old woman gets sued for downloading too much Britney Spears.  Of course, they should have really sued her granddaughter for even thinking about downloading Britney Spears, but the world is unjust.  Now, it seems, like even Christians are getting into.  Note this article I found recently:    urlLink Jesus Hates Dowloading!    Now, even Christians are getting into the condemnation act with downloaders.  I've even heard rumors that the Catholic Church is thinking about raising the sin warning level of downloading up to "mildly mortal".  To  me, it all seems a bit hypocritical.  Isn't one of the tenets of Christianity "sharing" our faith?  I mean, would Christians even be having this converstaion if someone had found a way to put the gospel into an easily downloadable form and inserted it into the Kazaa network?  I think not, and if someone could do it, it might just change a few Baptists minds about techonology being the Mark of the Beast and whatnot.  Anyway....  I have devised a new plan for file sharers.  One that will keep the art form of stealing music alive through the next round of RIAA lawsuits.  It is a difficult plan that will take a large amount of energy and coordination on the part of the file sharers, but one that might just work, doggoneit, if everyone pulls together and works as a team.  The new plan is called:  Your Local Library  Yes, I know it sounds kind've of nerdy, but we're dealing with computers here.  Many of you may not realize (especially if you are like me and grew up in a hick town where reading was only a notch above stump buring on the list of acceptable extra curricular activities), but the local library contains a wealth of media resources including CD's,  DVD's, and several versions of Children's Computer Games that will teach you typing in a fun and stimulating virtual environment.   Basically, your local library is just like Kazaa, except its not online you'll actually have to drive to get the stuff you want.  But other than those minor inconveniences, it's a digital wonderland.  So here's what we do.  Step 1:  Go to your local library and get a library card.  It's free and it works much like your Kroger Plus Card or Winn Dixie Advantage Cards, you can even get one of those little tag things that fit on your key ring.  Step 2:  Get online, but instead of heading straight to Kazaa or Limewire, or whatever illegal service you use, go to your library's web site.  For instance, the Nashville Library is www.library.nashville.org.  When you are there, you can sign in using your library card and then find every album or DVD that you would have downloaded off of Kazaa and then request those materials in your name.  When they become available, the library will hold them and contact you when they are ready for you to pick them up.  Step 3: Drive to the library.  Step 4: So far, every step has been perfectly legal and most are actually encouraged in many elementary schools around the nation (all except the driving to the library one, that one is not recommended for those under the age of 16).  This step, however, is where it gets a little hairy.  Once you have the items you requested, you should then take them home and use your CD/DVD/WHATEVER burner to rip the digital media and keep it for yourself.  Hahahahahaha......  Step 5: Return the media a few days later, not too soon, or somebody might catch on.  If a librarian ever asks you a question like "So you listened to that whole book on CD in one afternoon?" you know you have returned something too soon and need to start staggering the return times on your items.  Step 6: Once the media has been returned, it is then available for the next file sharer to pick up from the library and burn for him or herself.  I know what you are thinking.  "This could totally revolutionize the entire digital media industry!"  And you would be right to think that.  The Library will be our mainframe server.  Of course, certain issues must be addressed, such as, 'how will we be able to get our hands on early release material, like albums that are stolen from studios before the bands are finished working on them?'  That is a very good question and one worth addressing.  In such a case, the thief would have the responsibility of burning several hundred copies of the album and then seding a copy to each of the major libraries in the US.  That way, we could ensure that every good tax paying citizen has access to stolen material before it is supposed to be released to the general consumeristic public.  Another question: What about porn?                                You shouldn't be looking at porn, so don't worry about it.  Another question: What about quality continuity and ripping at the 128 mb rate?                               Don't ask questions that I don't understand.  This is supposed to be simple.  Another question: What about those crazy foreign records and movies that I can get online, like "The Wizard of Oz"                                                      soundtrack dubbed in Japanese played backwards.  That is so funny!                              You should only listen to good music, so this is irrelevant, and if you just have to have bad music, there                                are plenty of Time/Life compilations available for your listening pleasure.  I hope this clears up a lot of the confusion about what's going on here.  This could totally spark a new digital revolution in which we actually use our tax funded libraries for anarchy.  It sounds like so much fun.  The next thing I will be working on is a new way to carry digital music with us.  Intead of the iPod, I'm thinking about a system in which you get together with your friends, so that everywhere you go, they will have music playing on a stereo that you want to hear.   It could be awesome....

      I have been alerted that the nuts with dessert post has sparked quite a bit of controversy among office mates and at in at least one Muslim country (something about nuts being forbidden in the Koran?  I'm not sure, really).  But since I have taken an oath to be a uninter, not a divider, let me clear a few things up before protests start to break out in coffee shops and mom's kitchens around the world.  First, it may be true that not all nuts are legumes, but in my opinion, it is guilt by association.  A rose by any other name may still smell as sweet, but a nut in any kind of dessert defiles humanity no matter what phylus, genus, or species the nut has originated from.  But, since the point has been taken, I will rename the website that I will one day work on to: www.thesemisweetlegumless.com.  The "semi" being a play on words since it was noted that not all nuts are legumes and also a word that describes a certain type of chocolate that is sort of sweet.  Get it?  Moving on....  Secondly, it was also noted by a certain friend of mine, that she is neither old, a megaconglomerate, or my grandmother, and she still likes nuts in her dessert.  This has thrown a wrench into my hypothesis.  Upon further review, I also found out that my wife likes nuts in her desserts, and since I get in trouble if I insinuate that she is in some way part of an underground conspiracy, I will add a new exhibit.  Exhibit D:  It seems that females are more likely to enjoy nuts in their desserts than males.  This conclusion has been brought to the table after careful study and interviews of four women* and their likes and dislikes in the dessert categories.  The conclusions are amazing.  75% of all women** prefer nuts in pies over cakes.  25%*** like nuts in their cobblers, and a whopping 100% of women**** enjoy nuts in their cookies.  Compare that with 0%***** of men that enjoy nuts and I think you'll see a startling pattern.  If this evidence is not conclusive, I don't know what is.  Research is still being done as to why women prefer nuts in their desserts over men, but early guesses believe it has something to do with the extra energy reserves that women need in order to do all the things that women do (author's note: this is not some sort of gender biasing scheme, this is careful scientific research).    * - My wife, my mom, my grandmother, and Ciona ** - My wife, my mom, and my grandmother (Sorry Ciona, I forgot to ask) *** - Just Mary **** - I added Mary's mom to the mix for this one ***** - me  So, I hope this helps to clear up some of the confusion that has resulted as to the dichotomy of nut people and non-nut people. My next study will determine whether it is silly arguments like this that have contributed to the obesity problem in the US.   Happy eating!

      Mary had an interesting observation the other day.  She believes that the world is really made up of two spheres.  Two mirror image realities, if you will, rotating around each other of which each of us falls into one or the other spheres of being.  The two states of being are a.) those that like nuts in their dessert, and b.) those that do not like nuts in their dessert.  It perhaps seems a bit petty to divide people into such categories.  Have we not been through enough heartache as a nation without segregating the population according to their dessert preferences?  My personal preference is without, and I have started to take a keen interest in finding out who the majority is, and who the majority is not.  Here is my evidence.  Exhibit A: Note Starbucks coffee.  A megaconglomerate coffee dynasty with stores in all fifty states and about a gazillion other cities around the world.   Next time you're there, stop by your local barista and ask for the banana bread, minus the nuts.  You will only get a blank stare and bland tone as the coffee artist tells you that they do not serve banana bread without nuts.  Then, gently remind your local barista that it is Starbucks' company policy (which I found out from a former Starbucks employee) that Starbucks employees are not supposed to tell a customer no about anything.  Then watch in delight as the barista begrudgingly has to hand pick each and every nut out of your piece of banana bread. Compare Starbucks with my favorite local coffee joint, Fido, and you will find that the locals do not put nuts in their banana bread, and when they do put nuts in things like muffins, they make sure to carry a variety so that nut lovers and non-nut lovers alike may enjoy their wares.  Kudos to the locals and down with the man. The Verdict: Megaconglomerates enjoy nuts with their banana breads = megaconglomerates are bad.  Exhibit B: Older women always love nuts in their desserts, and it soon spreads to other foods as either their age or their nut affection increases.  For instance, as a child, I was constantly subjected to ridicule and criticism from my family for my lack of interest in nuts in desserts.  "Why won't you eat your brownie?"  "What's wrong with that 'Nutty Buddy'?"  "So, what, you don't like ice cream now because it has nuts on it?".  These were common phrases heard around my childhood.  For some reason, all homemade desserts from my younger years were all made with nuts, rendering them inedible to me.  It was like a ghastly form of Chinese water torture, holding a brownie in front of young child, and then poisoning the chocolate with the crunchy texture of a walnut.  Evil women.   The nut phenomenon soon spread to other foods.  Thanksgiving has been forever tainted once my grandmother found delight in placing nuts along with the marshmallows in the sweet potato casserole.  To this day, you will see me take a much smaller portion of sweet potatoes on Thanksgiving Day compared with the other foods on my plate. The Verdict: I am not an older woman, therefore, I do not like nuts in my dessert.  Exhibit C: People who don't like food like nuts in their dessert.  Why is this?  How many times have I seen a person finish off half of their Caesar salad with a nutty piece of chocolate cake?  At least once.  These are people who will subsist off of Melba Toast and energy bars every day if given the chance.  They take way too much pleasure in the complexity of granola.  Why do these people enjoy nuts in their desserts?  Do they enjoy the texture?  Does adding something crunchy to their food serve to remind them that they are eating something?  Do the nuts sufficiently kill the good flavor so that they will not enjoy the cake too much?  These are interesting questions that someone should ask those of the opposite sphere. The Verdict: Dessert Nuts have a higher boost of metabolism than other varieties of nuts, therefore, if you eat nuts in your dessert, you are skinnier than me, which makes you evil.  Therefore, skinny people like nuts in their desserts.  It has been suggested to me that I start a website for non-nut eating dessert people.  If I do, which I am making no promises to do so don't get your hopes up, it shall be called www.thesweetlegumeless.com.  There we will post articles and have a discussion forum on how to rid the world of nutty sweets.  In the meantime, I suggest that you boycott all desserts with nuts in it.  If we make a sufficient enough statement, I know we can change the world and make it a smoother place for all of us.

      So, the word is pretty much out to everybody that we needed to tell, so I’m going to announce it here for any lurkers that might wish to know.  Mary and I have decided to move….far, far away.    California, actually.  Yes, this means the end of Days of Lot as we know it.  Of course, there will be obligatory reunion tours and collaboration albums in the future (I mean, you can never just totally leave, right KISS?), but for all intensive purposes, this signals the end of the band and the start of new things.  Mary and I are planning on going to San Francisco, land of hippie love and progressive culture.  We should fit right in, just a few little bugs in some rugs from Alabama.  At the moment, we’re working on getting rid of our accents and our furniture.  So, why, you may be asking, are you and your wife heading to San Francisco?  Well, besides the obvious reasons (the streets being paved with gold and all that)….actually, I guess there really aren’t many obvious reasons.  We’ve both been talking about leaving Nashville for a few months, but we were just undecided on where we wanted to go.  I might possibly want to attend graduate school at some point in the future, but that would be at some other point in the future besides the current point.  I simply suggested California and that it has been for a while.  Therefore, below, I am writing my essay on why exactly I am giving up on music as a career and moving across the country.  Here we go…….  Nashville is a town where it is very important to know people.  I’ve never been to Hollywood, but I imagine it is the country/Christian music version of Hollywood.  It’s all about who you know, who you hang out with, who you work for, what you do, and who you know while doing what it is you do.  That’s Nashville in a nutshell, or at least what I’ve been a part of for the past year. I won’t say there aren’t some good people here, there are, but for the most part, there aren’t.  I can think of one good person off hand.  Okay, two if you count Jesus, but he’s everywhere.  I didn’t expect people to “notice” my band and me when we moved here.  I don’t really like being noticed all that much in the first place.  I was simply content to try and make a living playing music and somehow get involved in a community of people that appreciated the same things I did.   This was an unfulfilled dream on several levels.  First off, making a living making music isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.  I can certainly see why so many celebrity musicians seem to hate what they do.  It can be a vicious cycle.  You work so hard to get paid for what you do, to get a little bit of recognition, a little pat on the back, and then when a record deal comes along and gives you that pat on the back, you are automatically forced into making music for money, which can simply be a draining process, and soon you hate your life, and you find yourself either a.) a recluse, b.)a drunk, or c.) bashing the president in foreign nations while on tour (because if you can’t blame your record label, at least you can blame the president).   Of course, I never signed a “real” record deal, but I was making music for money.  I started doing it because I had to, and that is just not as much fun as I want to have. Secondly, I found one good community of people to get to know while I was here, and then that community promptly disbanded three months after I joined.  The rest of the time, I was either gone too much to get to know people, too tired, or just simply met some real jerk offs who didn’t give a real whip about me.  It was not pretty, because I like “real” people, and I think Nashville is really full of a lot of people who haven’t figured out that they are real yet.   So, I’m moving to California to start trying to live life again.  Nashville is full of people that want to “find” life, either through recognition, money, a record deal, a modeling contract, or just plain out being famous.  They feel that they will never find out what they are until someone else pays them or applaud them for their work.  I’ve had both; applause (from a bunch of 14 year old girls none the less) and money (although not much), and I can say that I didn’t care for either.  I mean, money is cool, but not at the expense of putting everything in your life on hold.  Playing in the band simply became “not worth it”. So, we’re going to Cali.  To find ourselves, to live, to be free, to be hippies (maybe), and to pay too much for an apartment (yes, we know it is expensive!).  But this is what we want to do, and we are excited.  There are a lot of good reasons for going.  We may never get this chance again, we should do it while we’re young, we’ve always wanted to live somewhere besides the south, we’ve always wanted to test ourselves and our ability to make it in the real world, and we’ve always wanted to see the west.  Those are all excellent reasons, and they all play a part in our reason to go, but truthfully, those aren’t the real reasons. The real reason is this.  We don’t have a reason.  We simply want to go.  We don’t hate the south.  We don’t want to get away from our families.  We don’t want to really be hippies.  We aren’t in debt to the country music mob.  We just want to go, and for us at this stage in our lives, that seems to be the best reason to go. So say some prayers if you get the chance.  We’re not sure how we’re going to pull it all off, but what’s new.  Mary could possibly get transferred to the San Fran Houston’s, but of course, like always, I have no plan for myself.  I just know I need a job (because it’s SO EXPENSIVE!).    Peace.

      An interesting article:  June 14 New York, New York:  One of the world's foremost theologians in the Reformed Tradition, Dr. Urmund Heinlein, is as dedicated to his Macintosh Computer as he is to his Lord and Savior, or at least that's his story.  The seventy year old theologian and pastor is an avid Apple convert, having turned to the computer after a lifetime of pen and paper.  Why the conversion? "I simply had an illuminating experience with a Macintosh" says the professor.  "My heart was turned, the scales were lifted off my eyes, and I saw why life is simply better lived with the Mac.  I can do things faster.  I can communicate with the world more efficiently, and my students enjoy the flexiblity that I have with scheduling classroom activities.  I can truly say, the Mac has saved my career, as well as my life". And it might just be true.  Dr. Heinlein's career was indeed in jeopardy just a few short years ago.  He was in danger of losing his position of Professor of Theology at the prestitious Reformed Institute of New York City when it was discovered that Dr. Heinlein never formally learned how to write in English.  For his entire forty year career in teaching and preaching, Dr. Heinlein had written all of his lessons, sermons, and notes in a little used dialect of German, that was a popular form of communication between many of the early founders of the Reformed movement as they were hiding out from Catholic officials in the sixteenth century.  Dr. Heinlein had learned to speak fluent English upon arriving in America in 1965, but he had never learned to write the language as well as he could speak it.  Instead, he would write notes, letters, papers, and other written forms of communication in the obscure German, which his wife would then translate into English. Dr. Heinlein's lack of written English came under fire, however, when his wife of forty eight years passed away a few years ago.   "We started to notice these strange looking notes on our papers," said student, Jesse Ruckers, who had trouble figuring out what exactly his grade was.  Indeed, the problem came to a head when the President of the Reformed Institute, Dr. Hank Vittles, recieved a hand written letter in the German from the desk of Dr. Heinlein.  It was his resignation letter.  Dr. Heinlein had become so distraught at his inability to write English, he said he "simply felt like giving in to the temptaion of despair.  It was a blackness that was eating at my heart and I knew my time was over."  Luckily for Dr. Heinlein, Chancelor Vittles couldn't read the letter.  "It was then that I knew we needed to have a talk," said the chancellor. But not wanting to lose his most distiguished professor, Dr. Vittles soon made a call to Apple Computers in late 2001.  "The Apple people were just great.  They actually had a member of their staff that was familiar with the German dialect, and that then learned the rest of the language, just in order to write a program that could translate what Dr. Heinlein was saying into English," said Dr. Vittles.  "Good Lord, they have some smart people over there." And indeed, they do have smart people over there.  Now Dr. Vittles types all of his worksheets, syllabi, and readings into his iMac (equiped with custom German keyboard) where it is translated into English and can be sent to his students.  "This has saved my life, and my career.  I thank the people at Apple, along with my Lord and Savior, for the foreknowleadge needed to complete this kind of product and save me.  Thank you Apple." And so, today, in New York, Apple has successfully saved another career with their top ranked customer service and ingenuity of product.  According to Dr. Heinlein, the most important thing now "is to get the the word out to all PC or non computer users.  From Jerusalem, Judea, and the ends of the earth, everyone needs to know about the Mac."

      Just to reiterate the certain silliness I posted below, I found this article in the NY Times.  You have to have a free account to read it, but it is worth signing up and they don't send you junk mail.  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/05/national/05sell.html  It is good to know that I am on the edge of a trend.  I'm thinking about living in a van and traveling the country to sell my shirts...wait a minute...that is what I do!

      So...here's something to think about.  Does drinking local beer make you a better person?  I'm not sure, but I can tell you I've been feeling rather saucy the last few weeks, and I think it has something to do with the Highland Brewing Company's Heather Ale. There is certainly something different about the local brews as opposed to the imported stuff.  By imported, I imply anything that has traveled a greater distance than four hours, or, if you live in the Milwaukee or St. Louis areas, anything that doesn't taste like crap.  Don't get me wrong, there's almost nothing I like better than a cold pint of Newcastle, but I admit, even in the nectary goodness of life that is that pint of Newcastle, there is a flavor, an essence if you will, missing that I have found you can only experience through the intricacies of the local brew. I have been privileged this summer to come to find the true nature of the local brew.  It is an interesting journey.  It starts in places like Asheville, North Carolina, and Greenville, South Carolina, places that conjure up pictures of inbred people brewing their malted beverages in shacks behind their houses (that happened to be located in some remote area of a "Deliverance" type area), using equipment that resemble something you might think would be used in distilling moonshine.  And for all I know, that is exactly what is happening, but dang if what they produce isn't better than anything else on the tap that night. There is a flavor, something almost indescribable, that happens when you partake of the local brew.  It is as if you are one with the local earth.  You feel as if you are helping the environment.  Maybe you should buy a hybrid automobile?  You feel as if you are helping the local people.  Maybe you should take a keg down to the local homeless shelter?  You feel as if you are helping yourself with every pint after thirst quenching pint.  Maybe you should become a democrat?  That is the nature of the local brew.  It is an inner journey, more than just a malt beverage.  An out of body experience, allowing you to find out what is really inside.  Of course, if you have a few too many, than you will have a much better chance of seeing what is inside while leaning over the edge of your local breweries toilet.  But that is another issue best left to the professionals. Luckily, I have been blessed with a local pub nearby where I am staying, where Mary and I enjoy several different versions of the local brew and a waitress that doesn't mind giving us approximately three pints worth of free samples every time we go there.  God Bless the USA.  They have names like The Highland Brewing Company, Thomas Creek Breweries, and Catawba Valley Brewmasters.  They name their brews after local people and places.  You can order the Carolina Blond, or the Low Down Brown, and then you can actually be served the beer by Mr. Brown if you go on Brewery Night (which is Wednesday).  It is an experience like no other. Yet, there must almost be a certain character of the people of a certain area to ensure quality brews.  Of course, you can go to any town and find the local brewery, but they come a dime a dozen and use the same recipes anyway.  You can't go to Montgomery to find good local brews.  For goodness sakes, they just got draft brews a few months ago.  I love you Montgomery, but you need more practice before you can be called a true brew town.  This is why I have come to love Asheville, North Carolina.  Alcoholic beverages are a way of life.  They are as important as free love and the hippie cologne that you constantly smell when walking down the street.  The local brews of Asheville have become part of the cities hegemony.  You can no more experience the true nature of Asheville without a local brew as you could understand the plot of a book without actually reading the words.  It is simply an experience that you must partake in if you are ever to get the real meaning.  You must smell the beer, taste it, live it.  This is the brewing way.  You become the beer and the beer becomes you. But have no fear.  There might not have ever been a harder convert to have won than myself.  Mary has just reminded me of how I would stubbornly order my same-old-same-old draft everywhere we went until she forced me into a pitcher of one of the locals.  I have been baptized, however, and as the old preaching analogy goes, when you thirst for beer as you thirst for air (assuming you have been held underwater for a minute or two...or better yet, you have been held under a vat of beer for a minute or two!), only then will you understand what real thirst means. So, to all you brew lovers out there.  Bottoms up.  Go immediately to your local tavern, pub, bar, or barbecue and order the local stuff.  Because it will make you a better person, and the world a safer, more peaceful place to live.  Well, that is assuming 'the world' is not an angry drunk. peace.

      Hello all, from Lake Junaluska, NC, the most beautiful place on the face of the EARTH!  Well, maybe.  This year, we also call it Seattle Junaluska as it has rained hard every single freakin' day I've been here.  What's up with this?  Lucky for me, God's grace shines in the rain and the in the ....sun...or wait....it shines even in the rain...that sounds better.  Anyway.... A notice to all you entrepreneurs out there.  If you want a quick buck off some unsuspecting Christian kids, please let me urge you into the Christian T-shirt industry.  It is amazing.  For some reason, if you are under 18 (and many times if you are over 18), you are able to sum up the entire existence of your faith to all of your friends and anyone you might meet, in the forty eight or so inches that comprise the back of a large Gildan pre-shrunk cotton t-shirt.  Who knew evangelism could be so easy! But, I jest.  The amount of money I'm making this summer is only slightly disgusting, but the way I look at it, I deserve it.  You should deserve it too.  If you want the guy's phone number who supplies me the tees, just shoot me an email.  And besides, I seem to have quite a few Christian t-shirts in my own closet from the many years of going to conferences where people just like me sold me a shirt.  I bet you've got a few too.  In fact, I even have one that I still wear, but it was a present from the youth group of FUMC Winter Park, FL and it's black and has a pretty cool design on it, so that one doesn't count. Other than all that stuff, everything at Junaluska is just wonderful, although I've figured out that I'm too old to still be doing the camp thing.  I should be one of those  youth ministers that is bringing his kids for the weekend, not the one that is still staying up until 2 am and then trying to drag my butt out of bed at seven while surviving off less than mediocre camp food.  Then of course, I remember, that I don't want the headache of youth ministry so I've decided I've not been called into that field.  So here I am...still. But I don't like to think of myself as a camp counselor (especially since I'm getting paid five times what the actual camp counselors are making).  I like to think of myself as an entrepreneur.  I'm the t-shirt man, playing some music on the side.  It's not a bad life.  Next up, I'm going to design a shirt that somehow fits the entire text of the New Testament on the back.  That should be a good seller.   PS - you should all see the movie Saved.  It is great.  You will understand my sarcastic mood today.

      The lights came up, the intro music went on.  Tonight, it was Michael Jackson’s “Beat It”, an ironic tribute to a guy who we all know was really talented but yet turned out to be so freaking weird.  What a perfect choice for opening music.  It was fun, everybody knew it, but somewhere in the back of your mind, you’re thinking, “this is just a little inappropriate, I mean, this guy molests children”.  We all came out on the stage, some of us were doing a little dance, our best Michael Jackson impersonations (oh so talented was he).  It was ironic, it was funny.  We were ironic and funny.  This was our last show and so we had to be ironic and funny to break the tension that you were feeling because the song might have seemed a little inappropriate but yet you could sing all the words, so what does that make you?  It was supposed to make you think about us, about how we were so talented, rockets soaring through the sky really, rockets that simply blazed out too fast, just like Michael Jackson.  You laughed a little because we’re all white and some of us are a little overweight and we’re trying to do Michael Jackson moves, but you knew this isn’t what you came for, you came for THE ROCK SHOW!  So the intro music went down and we started. 	 It was louder than you expected, the first chords on the electric guitar made you do a double take at first.  Then the singing started, perfectly blended with the guitar volume.  You started to sing along, you knew this song.  Then the whole band kicked in, drums bass, electric…it’s so loud!  Yeah!  All of a sudden you were caught up in the moment, the rhythm of the thing, the room moving back and forth…did those walls just pulse like a heartbeat?  Oh this is rock and roll and you were in the middle of it! 	 On the stage, the lights were getting hot.  We were only a chorus through our first song, but the lights were getting so hot.  We could feel the sweat stains forming underneath our armpits because none of us ever double shirt, although we’d been told to do so vociferously by the people we worked with because it looked silly to see eight sweat stains when we all lifted our hands to try and clap above our heads.  Oh well.  It was the last show, there was a whole life left to double shirt after this.  Tonight, we were living on the edge, our T-shirts hugging our bear skin.  We were men on a mission, and you could feel it! 	 The lights were hot, that was the point though.  Of course, I would have thought the lights would have been better, this being our last show and all.  Maybe we could have brought in some of those intelligent lights, the ones that made shapes and move around and all that.  Those lights look really professional.  We really would have preferred a light that could have made a Batman symbol on the wall over the drums.  It could have made the Batman symbol before we came out, like when “Beat It” was being played.  That would have been perfect.  Oh well, the one spotlight on me will do. 	 I could see that you were getting into it, really starting to feel the music.  You were clapping, laughing with your friends, all in all having a great time.  That’s when we decided to play that new song, the one nobody knew.  I could tell that by the second verse of that song everybody had become a little uncomfortable.  They were all looking around, looking at each other, admiring what a nice job the general contractors had done on the place, making it look so nice.  This was a good time to share something with your friends that were around you, something about how you thought that soandso over on the other side of the room was pretty cute and watch me hook up with them later this weekend, or man, this song sucks, I wish they’d play something I know.  Nobody knew the words to this one, but that’s okay, you indulged us and we appreciate it.  We liked that song.  You still clapped along though, and we’re thankful for that.  We’ve always felt that participation on a physical level is just as good as participation on any other level.  Thanks for all the clapping.  You were even nice after the song was over, giving a thunderous applause for the song, and at least three or four of you gave a customary concert whoop, a high pitched scream that let every one know how much you liked us as a band and also that you were a female.  Thanks for that. 	 We ended up not playing as long as we thought we would have.  Maybe we just weren’t feeling it tonight.  Maybe we realized the magic was gone and why try pushing our luck.  I mean really, if we had had good luck we’d still be playing.  All that aside, we finished up with our hit, our one classic.  Of course, we hate that song, hate the fact that we’ve had to play it over and over and over again all these years, hate that it is the stupidest song that we know of and why did we ever agree to play it in the first place. But you didn’t seem to care that we didn’t write it and have no strong emotional attachment to it and that it means nothing to us personally.  You were just glad that we played it, and boy did we play it well.  What would the last night have been without that song?  Really, that’s what we were all about, that’s what we did really well I guess; we connected with you, the fan.  We made you laugh, made you cry, made you feel embarrassed when one of us got short with you because you were trying to get a picture with us but forgot to turn on the flash on your camera so you had to run over to your friend and show her how to turn the flash on but then it was a digital camera and she didn’t hold the button down long enough so she kept saying, “It’s out of film, It’s out of film” but you knew it was digital and didn’t have film so you kept having to yell at her to hold the button longer but she was too busy telling you how its out of film and we had ten other people in line waiting to buy a t-shirt, actually give us money, and you just wanted a picture so we all stood around with these silly grins on our faces because we never knew when the camera would just go off in your stupid friend’s hands, but eventually you got the picture and now it is probably hanging on you wall and you look at it everyday and think how cool we are.  That’s you, the fan, and we love you for it. 	 So we finished that last song amongst great cheers.  It would have been a standing ovation if you hadn’t already been standing.  I guess that makes it a standing ovation, even though it would have meant more if you had sat down first and then stood up to clap.  We thanked you, thanked you profusely, really, and walked off the stage.  If there had been more than twenty-five people there that night, you probably would have asked for an encore.  Fifty people, maybe, but twenty-five, well an encore is just pretentious with that many people.  So you went your way, off into the night, to do other things and talk about what a great last show that was and how glad you were that you were there.  Thanks people, you were all wonderful. 	 Of course there will be reunion tours and the CD’s will probably circulate on the internet for years to come.  Some people will look back and wonder what ever happened to those guys.  And you’ll know…they played their hit, they said their goodbye’s, and they (figuratively, since it was already ten o’clock) rode off into the sunset.  You saw the last, great ROCK SHOW, and you’ll never forget it, and neither will we. 	 And someone, one of you, is kicking yourself, because, pretentious or not, you should have asked for an encore.

      There’s an election in the air.  Can you feel it?  Every other news broadcast has to mention it.  All your friends are starting to wake up from their political slumber and think about tough issues, like which candidate looks better and whether or not rolled up sleeves with an Oxford button down shirt is this year’s earth tone colored outfits.  Babies are crying, just waiting to be kissed.  School children are starting to anticipate the first day of school, in which maybe a candidate will drop by and make them a lucky photo-op.  Yes, that’s right, an election is in the air, someone should break out into song. 	But really, I’m twenty-three.  Is an election all that important to me (now that sounds like the beginning of a song)?  “Come on”, you might be saying.  “Elections are so 1960’s idealism, so….cliché!”, and you are probably right.  But this year, I say that idealism is back.  Why do I say that?  Because I henceforth deem myself an important voice in the political aspirations and idealism of Young America!  That’s right, if the only qualification to being a Republican or Democrat is simply thinking that you are a Republican or Democrat, than the only qualification for being an important voice of Young America is simply saying that you are.  So everybody say it with me: I AM YOUNG, I AM BEAUTIFUL…ALL OF YOU POLITICIANS…LOOK AT ME…DESIRE MY VOTE BECAUSE IF YOU DON’T I’LL THREATEN TO NOT SHOW UP AT THE POLLS JUST LIKE I’VE DONE EVERY OTHER YEAR SINCE THE VOTING AGE WAS LOWERED AND YOU NO LONGER HAD TO BE A WHITE LAND OWNER TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD!  So let me start with outlining the political platform of Young America.  All you political pundits take note; this could swing the election right here! 	Our first platform is simple: getting Bush out of office.  Why?  Well, because we’re Young America, and Ben Affleck tells us that we have to vote liberal, therefore, we vote liberal.  But let’s think about this for a minute.  Sure we know that Bush is evil, greedy, has trouble making compound complex sentences, is hated by everybody under thirty or who makes under a hundred grand a year, says the same repetitive things over and over again, may or may not have lied to us about the war in Iraq, and has been wearing that same stupid bright blue tie for three and a half years…but I think there’s another reason why Young America will vote against him.  He reminds us too much of our parents!  Not the compound complex part or our parents, but just the way he talks like our parents, looks like our parents, wants to be our parent.  He uses simple words; he wants us to understand things.  He tells us that we have to do something, even though we might not like it, because it’s really the best thing, and dammit don’t argue with me when I’m telling you something is the best thing.  He looks like a dad…and Laura Bush looks like a mom, and don’t tell me you don’t remember shuddering when that whole thing about his daughters being drunks came out a few years ago.  I know you were like, “Oh those poor girls.  Daddy ‘Dubya ain’t gonna take crap from them Texas Tippie Canoe’s, no sireee.”  We all know what’s it like to disappoint our parents, and really, if we don’t vote for ‘Dubya, can’t you just see that look of disappointment on his face?  I can see it now.  He’ll look into the TV camera’s and he’ll say, “This is gonna hurt me, more than it’s gonna hurt you.”  Then he’ll hang his head, give the American Public a big hug, and with shoulders hung low, he’ll just have to bomb another country to show us what we’ve done.  Bad Public.  Bad. 	Of course, then there’s John Kerry.  It’s not so much that he doesn’t look or act like a dad, it’s just that he’d be the kind of dad you’d want to have!  I mean really, John doesn’t look like a tight wad.  Need some cash?  You’re mom is Mrs. Ketchup.  You sneak in the house late?  Don’t worry; you’ll get a war story about sneaking around Hanoi at 2 am to catch up with Charlie.  Upset that he won’t let you take the car out for a drive?  Don’t worry; he’ll change his mind about that pretty soon.  Don’t like the grade that you’ve been given in school, maybe Dad will throw it back over the fence to The Man Holding You Down in Your School.  Really, John Kerry just looks like the kind of dad you’d want to have if you had to have a dad for President.  Then of course, there’s uncle John Edwards.  He just looks like the kind of guy who likes to lounge around on his pontoon boat all afternoon on Labor Day and talk about the big cases and then take you for a ride in the really expensive car that he always brings.  Uncle John is so cool!  And really Young America, isn’t that what we really care about!? 	Everybody stay tuned over the next few weeks and months as the Voice of Young America lets you know about what is really important and what is really not. 	Remember the Voice of Young America slogan: Don’t know what to think about politics this year?  Don’t worry, we know, we’re just not telling yet.

      If consistency is right under cleanliness, which plays second fiddle only to Godliness, than I have fallen from the triune.  Of course, I was never that cleanly anyway, just ask my mother. I have now returned from my summer of fun and boyish shirking of responsibility in my super hero band to my ordinary life as the mild mannered husband and currently unemployed packer of things.  Everyone can now rejoice.  The summer was great, my life has taken one more step towards further completeness, and now it is time to move towards other things.  I do hope a few of you are still out there to read this, as I know that when someone neglects their website or blog for too long, I eventually tune out.  Please...for the sake of my ego...TUNE BACK AND REPENT! I have a few things coming up on the blog that I've been pondering.  They are sure to make you laugh, cry, make you angry, make you happy, and most of all, make you a better person.  That's what we're all about here in the fastlane! So, please, let me know you still care.  Post a comment below, and strap your seatbelt in for a barage of blogs that will knock your socks off.  P.S.-now that I've hyped this thing up so much, I must produce.  I'm nervous.
