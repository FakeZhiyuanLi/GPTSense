      OK, now I'll answer the question  "Why have you been out of work for a year?". &nbsp; Well, it's a long an ongoing saga.&nbsp; I had major surgery in 2001 that went   bad, real bad.  &nbsp; Ended up with really bad internal infections.&nbsp; really sick and yukky.&nbsp;   After 'recovering' from all of that, after about 6 months, I started having a funny ache in my chest and a nagging cough.&nbsp; Went to the Dr. and he said   don't worry your pretty little head about it, blah blah.  &nbsp; But it never went away.&nbsp; Then a few months later I started having fatigue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not just regular fatigue like "I just mowed the lawn and I'm tired" fatige... This is like   KILLER   fatigue.&nbsp;   It went from bad to worse.&nbsp; For the next 18 months I was either in bed asleep or at work.&nbsp; Nothing else.&nbsp;   No Life.  &nbsp; Then in July 2003 the Doctors finally found "something wrong" (I think you have to be half dead before they can find anything).&nbsp; Enlarged lymph nodes throughout my body.&nbsp; They said it is Lymphoma or Sarcoidosis and did a biopsy.&nbsp; The biopsy proved it was Sarcoidosis (don't worry, no one else has ever heard of that either).&nbsp; The doctor said "You are so lucky!&nbsp; All you have to do is take steroids and you'll be all better in a week".&nbsp;    HA HA HA HA HA .&nbsp;     It didn't work that way.&nbsp; Yes, I took the steroids, but no, I didn't get better.&nbsp; Then in December 2003 I awoke one morning with "  telephone pole legs  ".&nbsp; Thats what I call them.&nbsp; Suddenly I didn't have knees or ankles.&nbsp; Just big appendages that HURT LIKE HECK.&nbsp; Ok, so now off to another specialist.&nbsp; Diagnosis:&nbsp; Inflammatory Arthritis (better known as Rheumitoid Arthritis).&nbsp; So I had to go back on Steroids PLUS the chemotherapy drug Methotrexate.&nbsp; That was in January 2004.&nbsp;   In May 2004 I spent a wonderful week in "Spa Crawford Long" Hospital with Pneumonia, and while the docs were running their tests, they found MAC (don't worry, no one else knows what that is either).&nbsp; MAC is non-contageous TB.&nbsp; Yep, that's right   TB  .&nbsp; So now I'm 6 months into autoimmune  SUPPRESSING  therapy and find that I have some nasty bugs in my lungs (and possibly elsewhere) that need to be  SUPPRESSED .&nbsp;   It seems that the best treatment for MAC is in Tyler, TX.&nbsp; There is a doc there that is world renowned for treating it.&nbsp; I met a gal who has been under his treatment for 9 months and    IS GETTING BETTER  . &nbsp; So I made the appointment and can't wait to get there.&nbsp; My parents and I will travel there during the last week of August.  Meanwhile I've developed some major pain right below my ribs.&nbsp; So off to another specialist who is in the middle of her tests.&nbsp; Her hypothesis is that the Methotrexate is causing swelling in my Pancreas.&nbsp; I did some research and found the MTX can also cause cirrosis of the liver - I found a gal that had been on MTX for 2 years and now is waiting for a  LIVER TRANSPLANT !&nbsp; So what's a girl gonna do?&nbsp; The cure maybe worse than the disease(s).  Well, thats my story and thats why I've been out of work for a year.&nbsp; I'm hopeful that the MAC is the key to unravelling this whole mess and to getting my life back.

      My Dear Father-in-law, Bill Allen, has inspired me to visit my now 1 year old BLOG.&nbsp; I was just goofing around one day and started a BLOG but never added anything to it.&nbsp; Now I think I might do as Bill is doing, and post my thoughts to it periodically.&nbsp; Today's highlights have been a phone call from pastor Mike, a visit from Shellie, and a check in the mail from State Farm.&nbsp; Not too bad for a day and it's only 5:05.&nbsp; My hubby will soon be home, maybe I can get him to go to DQ and get me one of those Coffee Moo Latte's... those things are addictive!&nbsp;

      Today was Kidney Doctor day.  He thinks I have developed  urlLink Lymphedema  as a result of my Prednisone weight gain and my Celebrex, or possibly due to Sarcoidosis, or even possibly due to my MAC/MAI infection.  So its off for more tests to see for sure what is going on.  The good news is that he thinks there is no kidney damage yet.  Wow, this just never seems to end.  At least I didn't have to eat radioactive eggs today.

      Information on MAC/MAI.   urlLink Simple Facts Sheets: MAC   While it is most commonly found in AIDS patients, there are others (like me) who don't have AIDS, but do have MAC and/or MAI.  So far 2 different organisisms have been identified in my cultures - one in the MAC group and one in the MAI group.

       urlLink RichardWallace  is the Doctor I'm going to see in Tyler.  I found out about him from another lady that was suffering from Sarcoidosis and non-contageous TB also.  She said he was wonderful and that after 9 months of treatment she is starting to be her "old self" again.  Then a friend of mine, Lenny, asked another TB expert in Italy who I should see and guess what - she said this is the guy to see!  So I'm very hopeful it will be worth the trip and will be the beginning of a change for the better.

         What a nice day in GA - especially for August !    Everyone got up early and went to the Old Soldiers Day Parade and let  me  sleep in - yea!  Amanda directed traffic and had to take down the barrier because a lady was having a baby in a van - really!!!  She had to let them through to get to the hospital.   Afterwards we went to Mittie's and had a nice lunch and then to get our hair cut.  I thought Amanda was going to go for it and get her hair cut short, but she didn't.  I, on the other hand, did get a lot cut off.  A new haircut always makes me feel better.  My hair stylist, 'Marc', was full of wild tales about Viet Nam and conspiracies.  It was a trip.  Michael is out back with sack-crete and rebar trying to shore up holes in the fence where our little digger   COCO   keeps digging holes.  She digs the hole, then she and her brother   SCOUT   both escape and wreak havoc around the house until some one man handles them back into the fence.   They are quite a duo.  The other day they got into a bucket of   TAR   (left by our thoughtful construction crew).  They spilt it all down the side of the yard and got it all over their hair.  Scout is blonde so it shows up real good on him.   Coco is black so it doesn't show on her.  Amanda spent hours trying to trim the tar off of Scout, but it really was a hopeless case; it will just have to wear off.   At 7:00 everyone is going to North Park for a pick up baseball game.  I'm going to stay home and stay cool.  I will probably take a long soak with some bath bombs and Mango Butter and then put in a Yoga tape.  I just heard a yelp from the back yard and it wasn't one of the dogs... better go see if my hubby is allright.

       I've been away for a week in the hospital again and now I'm back home.  I really hate to be in the hospital and miss my family - plus my e-mail gets so clogged up it takes me    forever    to catch back up!  Anyway I'm trying to get my  records together for my trip to Tyler.  Emory is not cooperating and it's a pain.  The coolest thing that happened in the hospital is that my stepson John called me on Sunday from California.  He is at 29 Palms in training.  He will ship out to Iraq in early October.  He is going to be guarding a gate at some airport over there.  I'm glad he is not going to be out in the streets too much.  He is brave and young and strong and not scared at all.  We are very proud of him.    I can't belive Summer break is over  .  Amanda goes back to school on 8/9 and Will goes back on 8/16.  Will has a   laptop   this year; at his school everyone gets a laptop starting in 4th grade.  Pretty cool.  He can play DVDs on it at home and he takes good care of it.   Mom has taken the kids to Wal-Mart and Blockbuster so I better go grab a nap while I can... bye.
