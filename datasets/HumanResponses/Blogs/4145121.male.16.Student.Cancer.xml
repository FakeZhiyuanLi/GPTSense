         Well. Lemme c, if my memory's serving me right, it has been about a week since I spoke a word to her. Ya huh, if you know me, u'd noe who i'm refering to. My mum's off to work and I'm sorta alone at home, sitting in front of the computer. It just leaves me no choice but to start thinking about her. That hollow feeling's there again, and I realised that life's so different without her, but on the other hand, I know that that's the way things are going to be and it's probably going to stay that way. Looking at the days when I used to chat with her everyday and when we used to go out together, thing's have really changed, and I suppose I've changed too. Yea, and now that band's over...I realise that I've learnt a lot throughout my four yrs in it. I know that my Passing Out Parade (POP) hasnt past yet and I'm sorta supposed to say whatever I need to say then, but I think I have so much to say that I just gotta start now. Gotta admit, the sec1 days were hell. Uh huh. A lotta people had musical backgrounds and that was a disadvantage to me cauz i'd be always behind them. While people were comparing to each other that they could play "twinkle twinkle little star" on their instrument, I was still struggling to get my Bb concert scale right. The National Day Parade my school took part in didn't help at all as well. I missed 75% of the band practices every week...including the theory lessons. Not to mention, my nationality seems to be a "problem" to my other sec1 members. Yea, they sorta shattered my enthusiasm in band. "Chinaman, chinafucker, go back to ur motherland la" were just some of the things I received from my peers. It was hard. I picked up the trumpet at first but was later transfered to the trombone section. Using a bloody condemned instrument, I practiced everyday and brought home my instrument to practice everyday. My seniors, were too involved in SYF to bother about me. I would just look in awe at what they could do but I'd just sit there and realise that I'd probably never make it. My senior JianXiang never really encouraged me either. I just get things lyk..."What the hell are you doing?", "Dunno how to blow louder isit?!" and stuff like that. Rensun was better, he bothered to teach me how to polish my slide and I always remembered the trombone slide of his Vincent Bach Instrument as being holy. It was the smoothest slide I've ever seen. So we got a gold for SYF that year, and at the end of the year, I finally went for my first public concert. I was excited, and I played and did my best, as far as I'm concerned. But yet, the band screwed up, literally broke down at a piece. I was sad, really, like...that's how my first concert became. Bloody screw-up. Yea,it's not exactly the best experience a Sec1 can ask for. And that night, when we went back to school, I sorta got punished by my new section leader, Moses. It was harsh punishment, but he put reasoning to it, so, yea. My sec1 days sorta ended like that, and still having bad relationships with all my peers. But that was the year. The year when I said I wanted to become a band major. Not that I'm power hungry or anything, but I just wanted to do something for the band and prove my peers wrong. Drills were harsh too, but I love em. It sorta turned me from doing one pushup to twenty. Oh wells, but me and my peers still suffered through it together, so we can all still remember those experiences till now. Guess it's time to go mug already,will talk about the other yrs in band some other time. Yea...it's gonna be a dry day. Mug mug and mugmug. At least I know there's some other hardworking soul doing the same. And as for Joachim, sorry dude. Oh crap, now I can't stop coughing. Argh.

          Well...I'm home. Exhausted. The day wasn't as well as it should have been...so let's start from the begining. I reported in sch as usual at ard 0630hrs and everything was in place, so the sec4 band members tried out our military outfits as the rest of the band went to set up the entire band at the track. Everything was still normal at that time, till we realised there was only 1 sash, when we needed 4 for the 4 band leaders...so my fellow smart band major came up with the solution to borrow it from the National Cadet Corps (Land) and so we did. Then...my fellow sec4 image head Ketsu came along and told us that our conductor was pissed. Oh yea...that was lyk...oooosh. It's supposed to be a good day u noe...and when my conductor turns to PMS mode...things ain't gd. So we went to face the music. Surprisingly...she was only mad at Ketsu and the Sec3 leaders...which I felt pretty bad about. I was a band leader afterall and no matter what, I should join in the punishment. And so the few of them was punished as the rest of us went back to our places. The performance went well and tt's the last time I'm playing with my fellow trombonist Weiqi. From now on, he's on his own and he'll be using my buddy fer 2 yrs - my Vincent Bach Tenor Trombone. That rusty piece of shit has been with me fer 2 yrs or so already but damn I love that instrument. It's been with me thru the gd and bad times...lyk when the dumb trigger broke during the SYF period and when we had the two successful concerts at the Esplanade. After that, two NCC heads came and said that they needed their sashes back. Apparently, their teacher in charge is realli pissed about it. Our yea, I was pissed too. Like...what the hell?! Since they decided to lend it, then just lend us all the freakin way then! But of course I returned it to them nicely. Afterwards...at around 0950hrs... I received news that apparently Ketsu's Service Award has been taken away. Oh yea. That's way too much. Lyk...which fucker would do something lyk that?! So what if he made a last minute mistake?! All the things he's done in the past is nothing huh?! It's god damned screwed up I tell you. Obviously Ketsu's shattered and when we realised it was the condutor that took it, we tried to call her, and yes, she DID NOT pick up. Bet she thinks she's bigger than the school. So later, all other 7 receipients got our awards but not Ketsu. He will get his award behind the scenes I suppose. Most receipients just got quite alotta cheers but weirdly...I had lower sec students shouting my name. Weird. And my dude Joachim received his award fer the Students Council too. Yes, I am ashamed of his being an EXCO in the band, for always being late and stuff. But on the other hand, I must admit, I've failed him as his Drum Major. After a whole year and I still can't help him change.     Ya huh... this is one of those rare times when I am extremely disappointed in myself. Yea...I'm sorry dude cauz I failed you too. After the whole thing...out teacher in charge talked to us and I thought it was gonna be a hell lotta scolding. But he didnt do that...he just spoke to us on several issues and thank goodness that didnt ruin our mood cauz he's just THE MAN. Haha...Mr Heng rox, big time. Oh well, we played soccer later and tried to cheer Ketsu up. He's a strong guy but I really feel bad fer him. Oh well...I'm done with lunch. Time to go mug in bed...inflamed throat not well yet afterall...ooosh.

         Whoa. Its already past twelve. Begining of a new day already...well. Lemme see, i've d/l a few new band pieces by jacob de haan in the past few hours, don't tell me i'm slow, cauz i'm useing 56K dial-up. I gotta tell ya...that guy's melodies are fantastic mann. And now my msn msger shows almost no one online. My study buddy of the night is now either muggin lyk mad or she's probably in the Zzzz state. And i realised that differentiation is harder than it seems. Not that i cant do the sums, but its just that i do them with such a slow pace that i'd probably finish not even half the paper if the O lvl paper was full of differentiation questions. Oh yea, and i'm still thinking about what to say to her. Lyk...we can see each other online without saying anything to each other at all... and i havta tell ya...that ain't exactly the most pleasant experience ever. I still think of her though i know very well she doesnt. Oh mann. Never thought things would turn out lyk this. Haha, but at least i got other frenz i could depend on, lyk Shu Xian...whom i still cant believe is the so-called neighbour of my Ex section leader. Ooosh. Like...damn, its a small world afterall...(not that i mean my ex section leader's a bad person or anything) Other frenz lyk debbo, LR, Merv, Eugene are all gettin into the O lvl full drive gear already...so, guess i should join in the club too. Time ta slp i think...fever's not going down and i doubt if it would anyway. So to hell with what the doctor said...i'm still gonna perform later at the band's marching music performance...:D

         Well...today was pretty boring. Stuck at home and starving to death. Yes...i usually eat a lot...but unfortunately, e stupid throat inflamation makes my throat ahurt a lot when ever i swallow anything. Aw..poor me. I just rested and did maths fer almost e whole day and downloaded a few new band pieces. On the contrary...i'm realli worried about tmw's band performance for the sch's national day celebration. The doc adviced me not to blow my instrument cauz it'd just make my throat's condition worse. But after some thought...to hell with wat the doc said. Band comes first...nt to to mention its my last performance already. A friend of mine apparently got grounded for the 4 days holiday. I realli cant imagine how she'd last through it...ooosh. I actually wanted her to come along with some frenz to catch a movie or smth...but oh well...things never exactly turn out the way they should be. On the other hand...i still cant seem to get over wadever happened between me and my ex gf. Maybe i should just cut all contacts with her lyk...forever. We don't talk or anything anymore, and she didnt even say anything about my concert...not even a normal "gd luck" or anything. But its hard not to think about her, its lyk...argh. wadever. I realli gotta recover soon, cauz i hate my mum to be so worried over this. Oh boy. Things just get more and more complicated. Love is a complicated thing mann..never should have gotten involved.

        To all band music lovers, mwahaha. I've decided to rank 10 band pieces which I think are the best. Here goes...          1.Fantasy Variations     2.Ghost Train     3.T-bone Concerto     4.Dublin Sketches     5.Fate Of the Gods     6.Alvamar Overture     7.Ross Roy     8.Noah's Ark     9.Overture 2000     10. Jericho      But of course, people's reference do chage after time, so don't be surprised if I change this list after some time...heh. It's 1pm. Hm. Got a whole afternoon...I think I'll finish Mrs Long's Mths stuff first and start with probably 4A and B for Higher Chinese. Yupp, sounds good, and not to mention, I dont havta cook tonight, woohoo! (Not that i don't like cooking) I oso gotta learn how to say 1 to 10 in a dialect, funky! And so, I'm off to my little room, with my 3 Avril Posters...hehe.

        Begining of a new day. I guess it is meaningless to keep feeling sorry for myself and getting pissed at myself. Just gotta stand up and keep going. I need a 78 for chinese next prelim. I believe I can do it. I know I can, and the journey starts now, the revision, and the mentality to never give up no matter how boring, stressful and tough things get. Yea. You just gotta push on, and pull through. Thanks to all my frenz for being there for me. I'm gonna push on, for myself, and for everyone that knows me and have faith in me. Okie, enouf of the motivation/inspiration stuff. Time for bed, if not, I'd never have the focus to revise properly. ZZZzzzzz

        ARGH. I can't believe this. I got 69 for my Higher Chinese. It's like... horrendous. I don't give a damn if I topped my miserable class or what, but personally, it's not even a freakin distinction, not to mention A1. I'm so freakin disappointed with myself...like what the heck was I doing?! How the hell did this happen?! Why the fuck did I only get 11/20 for my zao ju?! Argh, what the hell have i been revising!? And two bloody wrong words in my compo. ONE mark gone just like that, with that one mark, I could have at least gotta a bloody A. Maybe it's just me not putting in enough effort...but damn am I disappointed. It's all about me, and there's nothing anyone can do to help now. I'm so damn disappointed, and it's like the only time i've ever cried over my results in Sec4...while other people might be celebrating after the release of the O lvl chinese results today. 69, ARGH.

        Haha, yesterday was really fun. Okie...at least from 12 to 5...other than that was doing maths and etc...so yea, not that fun. Anyway, I went out with Debbo and Angie. I met up with Angie at Serangoon MRT station and we took the North East Line to meet Debbo at Orchard. And so we did, but since we were early, like very early, we waited for a few trains to pass before we actually got onto one at Dhoby Ghaut. Of course, Debbo was late, maybe by 4 min, but still late. She had a appointment with the barber, and yes, that shocked me. Like when did people start to have appointment with barbers? It's not like if u're seeing a specialist on Cancer or something, but heck. No way me and Angie was gonna go there, and eat while Debbo went for her haircut and later we'd havta watch her eat. Uh uh. So we tagged along and went into the barbershop. Debbo was looking thru different kinds of hairstyles and I was starting to wonder when my friend became Jennifer Aniston. Must style her hair one...whoa. But maybe it's another one of those mysteries a guy may never understand, the mystery of a gurl and her hair. Yea, like...totally chim stuff. And so unfortunately, there were no pictures of Liv Tyler or Barton around the magazines...or I'd have forced Debbo to do their hairstyles...like don't you agree that they are hot? Like...sizzling hot? So, we watched as her hair was shortened, but wait, did it really shorten? Ok...maybe by a tinny winny bit, but still considered a haircut I suppose. I havta thank Angie for the company for that once-in-a-lifetime experience (Yes, once only, never again), or I have no idea how i'd sit through it, even now i wonder how I did sit through it. So that took 2 hrs. Then, we went for lunch at Lido and blah blah...and after that, it was time to head back home  and mug. Debbo said that if she took her watever way of getting home (not sure what it was), she'd take 45min, and boy did she regret saying that. I basically calculated that if she tags along with us, she'd take 40 min only, ah hah! 5 min saved, so she had to tag along. We went back the same way me and Angie came and we walked her to the bus stop. We saw a bus 103 coming, and apparently, there was 103 at Debbo's house, so she hopped on and left. Then, we realised. I can't remember who noticed first, Angie or me, but that 103 came from the direction of Debbo's house. Uh oh, we're in trouble. So poor debbo actually got off the bus after two stops cause it sorta reached a Bus Interchange. She called and told me the bus turned left...like...left?! Erm...left is towards St.Andrews already, there's no interchange there...uh uh. So...later she called agian and said right...talk about a bad sense of direction -.-" We took a bus to sorta find her and got her onto a bus 70 this time, a correct bus finally. After that, me and Angie walked back and on our way, we met a evil organism which i call a Dog. Ok...not the main point, but damn it was fast and fierce looking. So that was sorta the end of the activities outside the house. And I must admit, Debbo is bad with buses. Yea. Okie, please don't hit me for that. So...the 4 day holiday is over...and I guess it's back to school.

        Well, today is Singapore's National Day, and I really have nothing much to celebrate about. It ain't my National Day anyway, so I'll make do with the long holiday and the great TV programmes, hopefully. Anyway, me and my study buddy sorta set a personal record today. Ya huh, you guessed it, she's D. U can think of D as devil if you'd like and my other friend A as angel...yepp. So me and her were chatting merrily till...3am. And did I mention A was supposed to turn up? Oh yea. She totally stood us up. Heh. Woohoo. That IS hardcore I tell you. We were talkin about things like having siblings. Yes, she has a point, that being the only child has its good points. But rawr. I SO wanna have a sibling. I gotta thank her for her offer to gimme her sister...but sorry that I havta reject :p Oh yes, and she was hurling insults at me. And lucky her, because it's her National Day, I decided to let her off. She called me FAT. ME?! FAT?! She is so dead. And she so insulted my house and afterwards me. Rawr. Oh well, and she's grounded. So I still can't think of how to pass her her ND present. I'm not gonna mention it here...it's a surprise. Heh. Oh well...I think I'll mug a bit and catch the teens award at noon. Oh yea...3am is a record.

        Today's funky...like...totally. First of all, I was tokin to two super funky people till like 2 am. Uh huh...two VERY funky people...namely A and D. U go guess who they are. Yea, apparently, it's the holiday that keeps us up, and no one's gonna slp till all decide to slp. It was a cool convo, and after that, it was good slp fer me. Woke up at 10+ and prepared to cook lunch from around 12. Finished cooking at 2 +pm. My mum's basically my assistant, mwahaha. She's in charge of the cutting part and I'm in charge of the actual cooking. Six dishes today and all tasted great (I'm not being biased here), and I literally helped my mum to clear up the fridge. Way awesome. I tried cooking them in ways my mum never did, like stir frying cabbage, celery, meatballs and a dash of bean paste. Weird combi eh? But trust me, it tastes good. Also made a fish head soup...I stewed it so long that it turned white, and tastes...so...fishy? haha. Damn I love cooking. Haha..."tell me what u eat and i'll tell u what u are" is a famous quote by who-knows/cares-who. And so, my food's funky...and so I suppose I'm funky? Ya huh. I'm way high...like..Woohoo. Well. Good times are over, gonna mug now...still gonna thrash my mum in a game of tennis later (Hopefully), after I mug for at least 3 hours. Heh.

         I got a friend. I met him in Sec2, or at least only knew he existed in Sec2. He was a councillor like me and was my good pal in band. I became the Drum Major in sec3 and he remained at his post as the Librarian. He had this problem of latecoming...and he was in my EXCO. So it is normal to give him a bit more chances, but yet. Every single time I give him a chance, he just turns up late again the next time. Everytime he does that, I feel pissed off and really disappointed. It's been a yr and now, I'm feeling really ashamed that he's even in the EXCO. As in, he's not setting a gd example for juniors, and who cares what he can do for the library department when he doesn't have basic things like self-discipline. But on the other hand, after some thought over the entire issue, I realised it was about him, but it was my fault. After a whole year of being his Drum Major, and three yrs as his friend, I've failed him completely. And I was trying to tell him that just now. But I can't believe the response I got. He's always late cause he had some reason he wouldn't want to tell anyone about?! Yes, and as far as I'm concerned. The way he put it is like it's my freaking fault to even bother helping him, and the fact that I feel upset is because it's just the way I feel and it's like there's nothing to do with him just made me explode. I'm not angry at him. I'm just so freaking sad and fed up that he can't see how much I'm doing all these because I want to help him as a friend. Since that's the way it's going to be, then just forget it. Forget it all.

        Sometimes, you wonder. What is the purpose of having a Student's Council and Prefectorial Board in a school? It's like...my school's student council...not doing much really. Prefectorial Board...just duties and discipline stuff...and worse still, hated by literally the whole school. It's like...I feel bad for the prefects, especially those who are extremely hated. Like, why the hell must they suffer because they're doing their job?! I myself am a prefect. But it's like... I try to be flexible when I need to and stuff, so it's more like a service to the school in that way. But some prefects just don't get it and are just so stiff with e rules in school. "We are ultimately serving the school and the students, not making it a living hell for students. We can bend the rules, as long as it's a good reason and a good cause that is behind supporting it." That's what my senior told me in sec2 when  I was still in the council. It means a lot to me...cause despite the fact that we're student leaders, we must still realise we're also students, just like everyone else. And maybe, just maybe, we should take off our ties and think like a normal student for a day, not a prefect, then we can reflect on how we've done as student leaders.

        Okie. Today is stupid...like, fruitful but stupid. Lemme see...started off the day pretty well, but ended it like in...total deep shit. The whole morning was pretty good, and in the afternoon, I went to do the CCA points list update. But so unfortunately, the miserable system is down, and being the long-winded teacher that he is, the HOD of CCA took like...almost one hour to brief us while we sat there staring at his "handsome" face. Yes, in any stupid dictionary, that would be the perfect definition of wasting time. And thanks to my stupid injury, I limped my way to Junction8 and took bus home. Spent from like 430 to 730 doing A mths and a chinese compo. After my short dinner accompanied by some olympic action on the TV, I went back to A Mths. And though I'm getting faster at the sums, it is HORRENDOUSLY irritating when I have any small difficulty doing any question. 8 to nw. about 3 hrs plus, yes, the frustration and weariness is growing. But what the hell, it's MY O lvls I'm sitting for here, and if I can't do all these for myself, then no one can. Argh. Even my damn good band pieces aren't helping to relief me now. And I must say, though my mum shows concern fer me and stuff, but at a time like this, I just can't stop but to add that to the frustration I already have about A mths. ARGH...some times parents should try to understand us more and at least see we're in a pissed off and frustrated state. And yea, johan de meij is a gd composer. Pretty grand pieces...but of courz...T-bone concerto's still the best.

        I havta say....I hate to say this, but yea, today is boring. Woke up at like 9+ and did amths. Had a good lunch, and revised some chinese, then got back to my amths again. Worse still, it rained. And lemme tell u, rain doesnt help to make ur mood any better. Yea, I went to pass Debbo e SS book...and hope it helps (her, i mean). Came home, dinner, and back to work. Rawr, yes, it is horrendously boring. Cheryl spoke to me on msn. Wow. Yea, it's been like...a month or so since we ever spoke a word? Yea, something like that. Maybe it's me or smth, but I can't seem to find anything to talk to her about. I don't noe...it's just...yea. Her msn nick is flowers in the window. I noe that song. She wrote me that song's lyrics once...some time ago. Yea, and things were...ok, nvm that. Anywae, a new week's starting. Yepp, at least that is something to look forwards to, and the olympics is on. Hope China does well...hehe. Yea...I guess i'd get back to work. Sign. It is boring today.
