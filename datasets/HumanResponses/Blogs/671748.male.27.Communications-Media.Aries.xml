      Okay. Patrick Roy is innept.  His Colorado Avalanche had a chance to win the Western Conference against the Detroit Red Wings, but his "cocky" attitude got him in trouble tonight.  When three Redwings rushed him, Roy bent down to cover the puck with his glove hand. In an attempt to hold it up to the referee in his glove hand, he misses and leaves the puck there on the ice. One of the alert Red Wings players knocks the puck in the net for a first period goal! After Patrick Roy had found out what happended, he certainly had egg on his face.  Patrick, you blew it for your team. Instead, the Red Wings tied up the series 3-3!

      Okay.. as much as it dissapoints me to do this, but I guess it's a good reason to start using this online journal. As the first official entry to this Hockey journal, I will use this to congradulate Ronnie Francis and the Hartford Whal... 'er I mean Carolina Hurricanes for becoming the Eastern Conference champions last night. They defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in yet again an overtime game.  This is the first trip to the Stanley Cup in their franchise's history. (Even back when they played in Hartford). Somehow, I don't think they can match up pound for pound against the Western Conference heavyweights. Either Detroit or Colorado will pick them apart!  Sorry, Carolina fans.

      Drama and excitement is the story from Toronto at the NHL 2002 entry draft.   First off, the opening welcome was responded to the "rude" and "disrespectful" fans in the Air Canada Center by booing the NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. He also was booed for congratulating the Carolina Hurricanes and the Stanley Cup champions, Detroit Red Wings.   There was some drama as to how the #1 pick was made. The Columbus Blue Jackets wanted to wanted to insure that they got the person they wanted. So, to screw over the Atlanta Thrashers, the Florida Panthers gave up on their #1 pick and selected third. Rick Nash of the London Ontario Knights in the OHL was the first overall selection. Jay Bowmeester went #3.  My hometown Pittsburgh Penguins have taken the defenceman Ryan Whittney of Boston University with the #5 overall pick.   On a personal note, my uncle works for the Washington "Crapitals" and got on TV when he was talking with their first draft pick. He got to hob-knob with the rich owner "Trillionaire Ted" Leonsis. He got lots of on air time as he was seen down on the floor at the represenative table. He does some of the media guides and most likely will do the profiles for the Washington draftees. My family and I are all proud of him!

        urlLink       Well, now that the Stanley Cup finals are over, we can begin to talk about the upcoming NHL draft weekend on June 22-23. The Pittsburgh Penguins fans, as the other 28 teams in the league that were not in the finals have been anxiously awaiting the Entry Draft.  There has been much speculation as to just who would be the number one draft pick (that belongs to the Florida Panthers). The top player ranked #1 in the scouting lists is Jay Bouwmeester. He did well this season with the Medicine Hat Tigers in the WHL. Florida is most likely to pick him.  Click on the link above to find out just who is expected to be the future stars in the NHL!

      Congratulations to the Detroit Red Wings for buy... I mean.. winning the Stanley Cup last night. I'll talk about this in another post later. Winning the Stanely Cup is the best thing - the most coveted prize in all of sports and hockey history. The Red Wings have certainly won it before. The last time they were there was the 1997 and 98 seasons.  I don't know what kind of spin on this to give. I hope that the Detroit Red Wings aren't percieved as buying the Stanley Cup this year because of all the high priced free agents that they added to their roster. Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille, and Dominic Hasek to name a few.

It has been closed since the middle of May, I have been trying to contain my need to go into "hockey withdraw." It is set to go back into working order on June 15th.

      Okay, I was surfing around on the newly improved and updated Pittsburgh Penguins website and I come upon a message board post that had a link to this website  urlLink NHL 2 Portland, OR . It's about bringing the NHL to Portland, Oregon.   Seems like a good idea, just as long as it isn't at the expense of the Penguins team and it's fans!   Back when the Penguins NHL team was in limbo and facing a lot of bankrupsy debt, they were talking about moving the team to Oregon.

      Okay, It's been decided and Patrick Roy is still innept.  After blasting Roy with 4 goals in the first period, the Colorado Avalanche lost 7-0 to the Detroit Red Wings. Detroit won the best of 7 series and the Western Conference title.  It looks like an all red Stanley Cup finals between the Carolina Hurricanes and the Detroit Red Wings. How are we supposed to tell these teams apart? Both teams colors are red and white.  Congratulations to the Detroit Red Wings!

      I took my last skate on the ice Saturday. *sniff, sniff* Since I will be moving away from State College, PA soon, I will not have access to a rink as much as I enjoyed going to Penn State's hockey rink. There, it serves like a sanctum to my troubled life sometimes allowing time to escape. Skating is like a gracefull act that starts fluid series of movements and perhaps be the only real way to travel! For those that actually have laced it up and enjoy the sport know what I'm talking about.  The last 10 minutes or so, I had all to myself. I skated as hard and as fast as my burned out legs could take me. So, when I couldn't go anymore.. I gave it one last lap for good measure. That's how much I enjoy skating - kinda says it all really. I wish I played hockey when I was younger or that I chose it over football in High School. I would have had so much fun. I've been skating for over a year now. Hopefully, I can find a rink close by my parents and maybe drive out to Greensberg, PA and skate at Kirk Nevin Arena. I heard of a few other rinks in Pittsburgh, but right now I don't know how to get to them.

      It was the oddest thing! I was playing NHL 2002 for the Playstation and had a match up of Minnesota Wild vs. the Pittsburgh Penguins. With less than 1:30 left in the game and the Wild on a power play down 5-3, Jim Dowd had the puck in the Penguins zone and from the top of the key, just somehow started skating in circles. This stunt effectively run out the last few remaining seconds to their Power Play and with it their hopes of mounting a comeback. I shouted, "Shoot it!" to imitate a fan sitting there in real life. Straka eventually sunk the "empty netter" for the Penguins to win 6-3.   This isn't the first odd glitch that I've seen the computer simulate. Another odd moment a while ago was when between periods the Rink PA announcer had given a warning to the fans (and presumably to the gamer) that "the puck could enter the stands at anytime, so be alert." This wouldn't be so bad if it had not zoomed in on #21 Espen Knutsen and Team Norway leaving the bench going back to the locker room for the 2nd Intermission. I'll remind you that it was Knutsen's blocked shot that went into the stands that claimed the life of a young Columbus Blue Jackets fan. Don't you find that eerie? A computer game and the programmers that made the game with no premonition of the tragedy, somehow later have everything line up for an insensitive twist of irony? What are the chances of a close-up of Knutsen and that random voice over at that time?

      okay.. after one day of being a part of the Hockey Pundits.. I almost got myself fired! After giving it some thought, the column that I wrote about Jarome Iginla, intending to be satirical, turned out sounding borderline terrible and it was published with the less offensive edited version. Whoops. I guess I'd better fly right from here on out.  Come on!! A guy with the exotic name like Iginla should have an equally exotic pronouncing first name... try it once... "Yar-o-may" Iginla! See??! It makes more sense that way! It's along the same lines like a sports broadcaster we have here in Pittsburgh, Guy Junker. Someone once gave him a french name "Gee Junk-air".

      According to a  urlLink Faceoff.com  article that was given to them off the European waver wire (kind of like the associated press briefs that American journalists get), the IIHF [International Ice Hockey Federation] based in the notoriously neutral country of Switzerland has determined through research that the Victoria rink in Montreal is the birthplace of Hockey.  People in Toronto are already pissed as they take their Hockey seriously. A response to the article by a reader of faceoff.com asked  "Oh, my God! What will Bob Cole and Harry Neale do now? Toronto isn't the birthplace of hockey? HNIC  [Hockey Night in Canada]  will be crushed to hear this and somehow rewrite history to prove otherwise."   Regardless of where it was first played, thanks, Canada, you've given the world a great game!

      Well, the frenzy has left everybody wondering what ramifications this free agency period has had the NHL. Salaries have gone up, the lower tier teams can't afford the better players to improve their team, and owners are reportedly losing money hand over foot.   "unstable eddy" Ed Belfour went to the Toronto Maple Leafs, CuJo [Curtis Joseph] signed with the Detroit Red Wings, Adam Oates became a Mighty Duck, Teemu Selanne knows the way to San Jose (and decided to stay there), the Columbus Blue Jackets have signed Scott Lachance (someone whom Penguins fans wanted in Pittsburgh) and Luke Richardson, and Robert Lang signed a big money deal with the Washington Capitals. But the most obsurd signing of the Free Agent period is Bill Guerin who signed with the Dallas Stars for 5 years and 45 million dollars.

      NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman dies and goes to heaven (yes, it's still possible). Once there, he sees the nice little house just inside the gate. An angel says to him, "This is where you will be spending eternity, the house that has been prepared for you." Soon, Mr. Bettman looks around and inside the moddest little house is decorated with little pennants, hockey sticks, banners, and many other rare memoribilia. He looks out the little window of the house and sees off in the distance a large mansion. The mansion is adorned with black and gold pillars. The windows are large and expensively designed with black and gold stained glass. Mr. Bettman squints and looks closer and notices that the windows have the Penguins logo on it while the big oak door is adorned with the Penguins secondary logo. Mr. Bettman asks, "Angel, why does Mario Lemieux get such a big house?"  To which the Angel replies, "That's not Mario's. That's God's house!"

      Okay, NHL free agency period has started!! Let the shopping begin!  The trend in the NHL now is to trade away your high priced free agents to gain an extra compensatory draft pick when the players sign with a big market franchise.  Already, Theo Fleury went to the Sharks, Curtis Joseph went to the Calgary Flames, Ed Belfour and Tie Domi became property of the Nashville Predators. These smaller market franchises are hoping that they can either sign them or get the compensatory pick for 'em.

      My brother Dave came to visit me here in State College on Sunday. So, I talked him into going ice skating with me at the PSU Ice rink (and yes.. it's not the last time, Iike I previously reported). I wound up meeting a Coach who was there to help teach little kids how to skate and wound up giving pointers to help my skating technique... like bending at the knees more and skating backwards. It felt great to be able to share my favorite sport with someone I care about like my brother. Normally, I go skating on my own. I wonder if I can talk a date into going someday?

       Well, the Penguins have finally unveiled the new home jersey to match their now away jersey. They wanted to throw away their old jerseys to which I am very upset that they are doing. Now, I have their "secondary logo" jerseys with my name and number on them that are now old and out of style. I wish they could keep using their jerseys they used last year, but the change was necessary. I don't think anything was wrong with the last ones, certainly, just because the team changes uniforms doesn't exactly make them Stanley Cup contenders. I will probably cave and go out to buy one once I have the money. I read up on the teams web page that some of the other fans think that changing the uniforms will instantly make us better. Those idiots!! Clothes don't make the man.. or in this case a hockey player! Now I have a closet full of penguins jerseys that I cannot wear as much with my name and #21 on them!

      This morning I want to talk about a young woman who I know is a big hockey fan. She loves hockey about as much as her Canadian herritage. Because of her, I have come to respect the Maple Leafs- her hometown team. You might have already seen  urlLink Trish Stratus  on many Fitness Magazine covers, on TSN Cable TV, or here in America as a WWE Superstar! She also was voted as  urlLink  2001 Babe of the Year . To say I have a crush on Trish would be an understatement. Her energetic personality shines through every Monday Night on WWE Raw as her stunts, interviews, and gorgeous body entertain me along with the rest of her fans. All the photos that I do collect of her, Trish appears in my favorite in an oversized hockey black and white game sweater sponsored by the NHLPA. I will post it up on here sometime soon. On a recent  WWE Confidential  program, she gave a tour of her home while showing off her action figure collection of Mats Sundin and Curtis Joseph.  I dedicate this blog journal entry to my "hockey hunny"... TRISH STRATUS!  Then, Trish is not the only hockey fan in the WWE! Former champion, Chris Jericho a native of Winnepeg, had his dad play professionally for the NY Rangers. Chris also is active playing in celebrity hockey games.

It was an exciting high scoring affair! 12-10 Toronto! The lead changed hands at least 3 or 4 times. Domi got the empty netter at the very end.

      I had my day all planned out today. I was going to go to work in the morning, then go ice skating, then meet my dad, then take my sister and her boyfriend to church. September 29th is a special day for me because in the Catholic tradition it sets asside a day to honor St. Michael. I try to keep him in my thoughts and say little prayers thouout the day.  While I was at the ice rink today, I met a nice girl that works there. Chrissy. She had basically just stood on the bench side of the rink and watched everybody go by during the second hour of Public Session skate. She told me that she was a student studying psychology. I told her that I worked for WRSC and was pretty impressed. I might go back and talk to her some more some day.  Then, I noticed all my old girl-friends hanging around in the rink's lobby. They had just gotten done with a game. They lost, but I was glad to get a chance to talk to the coach and invite them on the air to be a guest of Sportsline on WRSC/WBLF sometime.  I also watched this supposed father/son outing at the rink today. The poor kid must have either been on the ice the first time or he wasn't going to use the metal "walkers". His dad held his hand as the poor kid was afraid to actually skate. The kid had these huge gloves, helmet and these really nice pair of CCM skates like he was playing hockey. I looked at the dad and his facial expressions were that of disappointment at his kid's progression. They moved an inch at a time and hugged the boards closely. I think the poor kid only went around the rink once. When I passed him just getting off the ice, I clapped for him and applauded his efforts. If I were that kid's dad, I would have been more patient and understanding than the grownup that I saw. Off the ice, the kid played on the benches right outside the rink and looked happy. I hope that the guy didn't waste a whole lot of money on the kid. Maybe he'll want to come back again.

They played a pre-season exhibiton hockey game against their old rivals the Montreal Canadians today. Adam Foote, Joe Sakic, and Peter Forsberg were two of the few remaining players who remember playing in Nordique blue. They told the press that they were nostalgic and glad that the 15, 339 fans gave them enough cheers. Montreal still one the game 4-1.

      The Alexei Kovalev saga that is going on right now is getting interesting to follow. From what I understand, the GM Craig Patrick and Team Owner Mario Lemieux oferred Kovalev a ton of money to extend his contract twice. Kovalev turned both of them down. The second and most recent time, Kovalev turns it down and decides to talk it over with his agent to make a counter offer. Since then, GM Patrick has said that if it doesn't get done, he will not continue contract extension talks after October 10th when the season begins.

       " You could be seeing the Leafs in late May again next spring. But missing the playoffs is also a distinct possibility. "  - Tony Gallagher, Faceoff.com Columnist   Way to go, Tony! That's the real sure-fire Hockey journalism that people need! Take a stand! (For some of you Canadians without a sense of humor, I was being sarcastic there.) Also, it gives me hope knowing that this is my competition in the world of Hockey Journalism. I know I'm better than this guy! Geez!   What really needs to be said... The Leafs do have a pretty good shot at going back to the playoffs this year. They've got one proven goaltender in "Unstable Eddie" Belfour, picked up some key acquisitions this summer with Fitzgerald and Shvela. The biggest sneak in the whole summer was re-signing franchise player and notorious goon, Tie Domi after they gave him up to Nashville in a trade over the summer.

This means that my beloved Penguins are gearing up for a new season with a lot of new players on the roster. Daigle, Vuijtek, and Salivanov are some of the veterans in camp on a try-out level.  I'm thinking it's about time that I hit the ice again too. I'm planning on skating from 1-3 PM at the ice complex this afternoon.

      I wanted to use this time to put up a small little remembrance post about all of us who were affected by the Attack on America. All of our lives were changed that day. In a special way, the entire world was changed. The Hockey sports world also was affected and did what it could to heal America.   Directly, The Los Angeles Kings were affected by losing two of their scouts. This past season they wore special patches in their honor. The New York hockey teams were also at the top by helping to raise money for charity. Buffalo Sabres created their 'one time only' third jersey replacing their buffalo head logo with a diagonal 'New York'. The Philadelphia Flyers wore special American flag patches on their orange away jerseys on the back of their uniforms. The most visual and most lasting tribute to the tragedy is the placement of a large red, white, and blue ribbon behind every goal net directly on the ice. The Washington Capitals were also sorrowful with the loss at the Pentagon.   Hockey did the best it could to heal the wounds. It focused many North Americans on who were the real heroes.    9/11/01... We will never forget.

        urlLink  Hockey Fanatic's Dreams Come True as Voice of Alma Matter Hockey Team   Michael Fedor has announced plans to become the new play-by-play announcer for the 6-time ACHA National Champions Penn State Nittany Lion Icers. After a successful trial run with area high school football games, Michael was announced on air that WRSC 1390 AM / WBLF 970 AM will be there for the Penn State University Hockey team this comming season. The team has just come off a three-peat year in the ACHA, hoping to do it once again for a 4th straight championship year. Like a big fish in the little pond, plans for the program are to join Division I NCAA competition in the future.  Michael has had experience in University varsity sports as the Public Relations/PA announcer for the Penn State Lady Icers last season. No word as to any plans if Women's hockey will be covered on air.

      As I was surfing along Reuters on the Internet looking for something to discuss on the [much hated] PSU student radio station as a special guest of the DJ there, I found a story that I should mention here as well.  A Professor of English Literature at the University of Saskatchewan, Michael Kennedy, has a unique class on the curriculum. At the college, Prof. Kennedy teaches a course called  Reading Culture Canadian Hockey . The class there is so popular that for the Spring 2003 semester, the allotment of 39 students has already been filled.     "Themes such as isolation, survival or the immigrant experience are more common threads in Canadian literature."  But Kennedy argues that hockey -- a sport that Canadians love with a near-religious passion -- is often used as a metaphor in the country's writing.  "It's a device for protagonists to "find themselves," and a means for defining Canadian culture", he said.      To achieve this, Kennedy has a reading list of novels, poems, and a play script  "Les Canadiens"  about a history of Quebec within the confines of a hockey rink.    The class really seems legitimate as the students are expected to learn from many different sources of fiction and nonfiction sports articles and applying critical thinking to distinguish fact from opinion. One assignment saw students learn about jargon, rampant in hockey commentary.      "Students learn to research and write essays, defending their positions on the game,"  Kennedy said.

      Tonight,   MY   Pittsburgh Penguins face off against the rival Washington Crapit... 'er I mean.. Capitals. The feature matchup is Mario Lemieux playing against his former employees - Jaromir Jagr and Robert Lang.  I would have loved to see this game, but I have to work. I gotta stick around and let "Ironhead" go on the air and promo the Monday Night Football game from  urlLink  Damons Restaraunt.  Luckilly, "Ironhead" is keeping me updated in the  urlLink WRSC 1390  studio on the hockey game.

      Jason Spezza made his NHL debut tonight in Boston.  Anointed as the "next best thing" among hockey experts, Spezza wore #39 for the Ottawa Senators. Spezza was called up from the AHL because of an injury to Radek Bonk. He collected his first point by assisting on a Marian Hossa goal. Fans expect Spezza to be the next superstar having done something that only three other NHL players have done - play for Team Canada in the world Juniors at age 18. Only Lemieux, Gretsky, and 2002 draftee Bouwmeister have that honor.

      See Minnesota in High Definition TV this season!  The NHL along with HDNet announced that they have made plans to air some games in high definition picture quality to appeal to those who own HDTV sets. However, the schedule of games to be broadcasted isn't exactly going to permit people to see all of their favorite teams in that quality. According to the NHL website, of the 7 games listed to be broadcast in HDTV, 4 of them involve the Minnesota Wild. You would think that they would at least try to get all the teams on there once! Personally, I don't mind. I like Minnesota with their star player, Marian Gaborik. These first 2 games against Colorado sound pretty good!  Sun., Oct. 27 9:00 p.m. Minnesota @ Colorado  Tues., Oct. 29 8:00 p.m. Colorado @ Minnesota  Sun., Nov. 3 7:00 p.m. Nashville @ Phoenix  Mon., Nov. 4 10:30 p.m. Minnesota @ Los Angeles  Wed., Nov. 6 10:30 p.m. Nashville @ Anaheim  Thurs., Nov. 7 9:00 p.m. Minnesota @ Phoenix  Fri., Nov. 8 8:30 p.m. Toronto @ Dallas   This almost makes me wish I had the money to buy an HDTV now.

      Evgeny Nabokov has received an enormous pay raise today as he ended his holdout, signing with the San Jose Sharks for 2 years 7 million dollars [according to SportingNews Radio]. Last season, the Kazakhstan native earned $575,000 US last season.  Some quick notes about Nabokov is that he is the 7th goaltender and first European-born goaltender in NHL history to score an actual goal during a regular season NHL game. He ranked 3rd last year in the NHL with 37 wins. He won the Vezina trophy as the leagues top goaltender and in 2000-2001 was selected as the Rookie of the Year.

      Thanks for all the extra prayers and good vibes.  Last night I made the on air broadcast of the Penn State Ice Hockey team as the on air color analysist. Things were looking pretty bleek there for a while, I didn't know weather or not my bosses would give me the chance to voice the Icers, but when the opportunity finally came down to the wire, I was in the studio when I was told to go ahead over and help out with the broadcast.  I met Jason Mals, a crossover from the PSU student station, at the Greenberg Ice Sports Complex. He was worried about doing the broadcast by himself so he originally got some of the PSU hockey players not dressed for that game. When I met Jason, he was also profefssionaly dressed in a shirt and tie. We did our best with what was available to us. Originally, we had some problems dialing in, but once we got everything together, we were doing pretty well! We talked at length about the Icers and the upcoming Football game with Northwestern. Later, we brought the stuff back from the studio and got a tape to keep with our performance.  Penn State won 9-1 vs. Kent State.

"What has been the biggest surprise so far this season?"  The choices were/are:      Tampa Bay is undefeated   Minnesota is the best in the Western Conference   Mario is healthy and on fire   Colorado is the west's lowest scoring team   Toronto is the east's highest scoring team

      Already starting behind a huge hole after the first game of the year with negative point values due to a Commissioner's Snafu, the   Ruthless Aggression   have taken over first place after 5 games into the NHL season. I've here is a dead heat with second place as one point separates the   BeeGees   of   2099   and the   OYLERS   and the fourth place team is the   Imbeciles   who seem to be struggling a bit. It's still anybody's lead for the taking! I hope the league stays active and remembers to set the lines everyday. (but you can "cheat" a little and set the rosters days in advance)  It's an 82 game schedule, we'll see how this all works out in the spring!

      Revenge was on the minds of the Pittsburgh Penguins and their fans as they all traveled to Toronto to wash their hands of the embarrasing 6-0 opening day loss.  There were some really stunning goals scored by Aleskey Morozov, Mario Lemieux, and Ville Neminen. Morozov hit a top shelf glove hand goal late in the third period and Neminen scored an amazing goal by skating out to the top of the key, then doing a 360 pirrouette and then with the final follow-through used a wrist shot to score a goal earlier in the third period Mario also scored an amazing goal from behind the net by banking it off of the goaltenders back. The goalie was later credited this quote:  "He's done that 100 times."   The final score was 5-4 in favor of my Penguins, but the revenge wasn't as fulfilling enough. The goaltender that was in the net the first game for the "Leaves" has been injured and did not play this game. Also, I should congratulate Mats Sundin for scoring his 400th career goal last night.  I have been really gaining respect for Toronto because I know they are really good and they are Trish Stratus' favorite team. I hope that they can build this into a new rivalry.

      The EA Sports Trax is the next best big improvement that EA Sports has given to their long running gaming franchise on  NHL 2003 . EA Sports thought instead of having some really boring, innane, and repetitive instrumental music that covers the menu section in NHL 2002. (I usually just hit mute on my TV when I'm working with the rosters or create a player mode) A little black box pops up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen to let you know what song is playing, who performs it, and what album it's from. I was so surprised and glad that they chose to contain two songs that are on my station  urlLink  WQWK 97.1fm - Qwk Rock . The adrenalin pumping "Sweetness" by Jimmy Eat World and Papa Roach's "She Loves Me Not" are two of the best known songs included in the lineup. "Modern Rock and Hockey go together like peanut butter and jelly.  As far as the gameplay goes,  NHL 2003  emphisized more realism with the hockey players giving you more control over stick handling, deke-ing, and shot selection. I'd bet that their game developers, designers, and focus groups told them they wanted more realistic movements. You can't have your cake and eat it too though, with all the detail in the skaters movements, it slows down the game play. I guess people who complain about it being too slow is used to 16-bit "hat trick hockey" games where all players looked the same and molded the same way.  NHL 2003  is unique in that way. Diving over a sprawling goaltender, cutting back around a defenseman makes for great hockey action immitating a real world senario.  Some negatives with the PS2 version compared to the PC version is that the some rosters and uniforms are not in the game. You won't see the Penguins new "vegas gold - skating Penguin" home white uniforms in the PS2 version (which is okay since I like last seasons home jersey more) and the Los Angeles Kings (who have the nicest uniforms in the NHL) won't have updated uniforms since they dumped their coat of arms crest for a silver crown logo made popular from their 3rd jersey. Their royal purple, silver, and black are really nice. Team USA has no updated jersey from their silver medal Olympic team. Also, my two favorite teams to use Pittsburgh and Team Slovakia have their rosters slightly off. Guys like Beranek, Brown, and Dollas have not played in years, but still remain on the Pens roster. Machala somehow found a way to appear on the Slovak roster after being MIA for 2 years since they can fill a whole team with Slovak players.

      I was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay off on that one. *pouts*  I went to my new favorite hangout tonight to watch the Penguins drop their home opener 6-0. It was aweful to watch. Another thing that I'm going to have to get used to is the new home jerseys. They look way too white. There's no more yellow only vegas gold. Mats scored two goals and got goal #399 on his career tonight.  On a lighter note, I got to see a familiar face in Kristen the waitress and meet a really sweet young lady named Meghan at "my favorite place to be".  I also got to go to Blockbuster and rent EA Sports NHL 2003. I will post a review of the game real soon.

I expect the teams to really test out the goaltending with a barrage of shots at the net. We get our first look at "Unstable Eddie" Belfour in the net for Toronto tonight. Look for him to do something highlight worthy to make a good first impression.  Prediction: Pens 4 "Leaves" 2

Then, the Colorado "'Lanche" are in action tonight against the team formerly known as the Minnesota North Stars.  My beloved Penguins are in action tomorrow night,... I'm going to make sure to watch that game!! It's what I've been waiting for all summer long! Go Mario!! Go Kovy! Expect a pregame and postgame analysis from me about the Pens vs. Leafs.  I've signed up and created my own Fantasy Hockey League on Yahoo... the teams are stacked! I am thinking about making it mandatory for all the teams in the league to check this page out. It's going to be a real fun year!

      In an effort to diversify my reporting on things other than NHL and Pittsburgh Hockey, the Erie Otters have made the front pages on faceoff.com.  Last year, I watched a game between the Kitchner Rangers at the Erie Otters. Saturday night, those same two teams opened up the Ontario Hockey League schedule. Erie raised their 2001-02 OHL championship banner in front of a sold out 5,280 Tullio Arena crowd. Alas, Erie wasn't able to pull off the win. Those Rangers from Kitchner, Canada won the game 8-4.

       Former Owner of Montreal Canadiens Dies  MONTREAL (AP) -- Hartland de Montarville Molson, a former Canadian senator and longtime owner of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, has died at age 95.  Molson also headed the family brewing dynasty, but is best known for his association with the National Hockey League franchise. Molson was inducted in the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973.   Molson served as a director of the brewery for more than 50 years and held the positions of president, chairman and honorary chairman. He was appointed to the Senate in 1955 and he served 38 years until the age of 86. Born in Montreal in 1907, Molson joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1939 and was wounded during in the Battle of Britain.    ~Awww.. Rest in peace, Mr. Molson. I'll have a bottle of Golden in your honor tonight.

        "Fedor Fedorov wasn't a first-round draft pick, was never considered a star in junior and wasn't even signed by the first team that drafted him. Last season, his first as a pro, he suffered a career-threatening eye injury and played just 10 games. If his name was Fedor Eastwood, in fact, he would have been a complete afterthought coming into the Vancouver Canucks training camp. But in three short weeks, the 21-year-old centre has morphed from a project into the Canucks' best prospect. We don't know what that says about the Canucks' recent drafts. We do know what that says about Fedorov."   Ed Willes,  The Vancouver Province    No relation.

      Today, my brother and I went to the Mellon Arena on our Thanksgiving vacation to see the hometown Pittsburgh Penguins vs. their hated rivals the Philadelphia Flyers.  We did get great seats, but enjoyed the birds eye view from the "F" section. It was so high up that the new netting behind each goal was not a factor to enjoying the game, in my opinion.  The Pens went on a scoring rampage, netting 4 goals in the first period and scoring 40-some seconds into the next. I was hoping that the game would turn ugly so that there would be a fight or two!  Pens win!! 7-2!!

The article starts out by mentioning that my favorite player not on the Penguins team was the first person to score a goal for the new Minesota Wild. The "experts" and teammates in the article also says that he is a great player, but has a lot to learn still. His coach told reporters that he wasn't ready to put "Gabby" Gaborik in to the superstar category just yet.

      The LEGO company and the National Hockey League announced today that they've agreed on a internationally cross promotions merger with LEGO. There will most likely be LEGO toys featuring the NHL brand and the All-Star Entertainment will have some sort of LEGO tie-in.  I'm skeptical that this will work. Apparently, Bettman wants to get like the cigarrette companies and market to children.  The only thing that they did right was announce it at the "21 Club" in New York. Twenty-One is a lucky number.

      The NHL has been reported to issue heavy penalties to a few New York Rangers because of what happened in a recent game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. What makes matters worse than having a high-priced talented team like the Rangers getting their collective ass beat by a young expansion team, but with 2.5 seconds left and losing 6-3, Coach Bryan Trottier put noted "enforcers" Krystof Oliwa and Sandy McCarthy on the ice to take the faceoff. Once the puck was dropped, the "enforcers" dropped the gloves, clobbering Grant Marshal.  Oliwa (a former Penguin and Blue Jacket) was suspended 5 games and forced to give up his salary for those games. Coach Trottier (a former Penguin player who I thought was a real class individual) was suspended for two games and McCarthy is now $1,000 less. If that wasn't enough, the Rangers organization was also fined $25,000 dollars.

      When you combine my two favorite things in this world, you can sure bet that I'm interested!  On November 6th, the Women's Team Canada defeated the Women's team USA in the Four Nations Tournament. The ladies from USA were outmatched because they only had only 9 players return from the Salt Lake Olympic team to Team Canada's 16. Goaltender Kim St. Pierre made another outstanding performance worthy of her predecesor Manon Rheaume by stopping 26 shots and 6 powerplays. The games are being held in Kitchner, Ontario and surprisingly the USA vs. Canada tournament game was played in front of 5,371 fans Kitchner Memorial Auditorium.  The other two teams involved in the tournament are sports international rivals Sweeden and Finland.

      Most Americans would like to take one of our rights seriously. Especially those rights dealing with censorship. Sometimes, we take those rights for granted. I would like to remind you all that it is important in a democracy that people vote. It's how decisions are made that affect your lives!  That being said, please go vote at the NHL.com page to vote for your favorite NHL all-stars to compete later this season in the 53rd annual All Star game in Miami, Florida on February 3rd, 2003!  I am glad that they have finally dumped their North American vs. The World format for the more traditional East vs. West Conference. For a Pittsburgh fan like me, it's hard to pick which all star team to root for because most of the Penguins all-stars are European. That would take away the attention of my home country and players for North America. At least this way, I know to personally cheer for the Eastern Conference! In my opinion, I think they should save the America vs the World format every four years when the Olympics are played.

      I got another amazing opportunity in the hockey world.  Working on another assignment for WRSC/WBLF, I went over to the PSU Ice Rink for the PSU vs. Towson game. I recognized the head coach of the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins, Glen Patrick in attendance. Knowing the Patrick family as friendly and approachable, I politely made conversation with him and introduced myself as a radio broadcaster. I asked Glen if he would go on the air for an interview after the game. I had already run into his brother Craig at the icers games - Craig being the GM of the Penguins.  My friend Dan was really impressed as I talked at length with Coach Patrick about the Penguins franchise, it's players, and talking about recruiting from the college ranks. Yes, I did get a recording of it and hopefuly use the experience in my career as a broadcaster again someday soon.

      In an interesting move in Denver today, the Colorado Avalanche fired their head coach Bob Hartley and replaced him with the assistant coach Tony Granato.   Note: Cammi was the color commentator for Sharks hockey when her brother Tony played for them in the mid to late 90's   I guess that the management "higher ups" think that Colorado lost their premier team status in the NHL and is now considered not an invincible team. Roy has had his problems in goal. Sakic has been on the shelf twice this season.  Stop the bleeding.  No word as to weather or not Cammi Granato will put her career on hold to be an assistant or the Avalanche's braodcaster.

      ...from the same person as heard on the Pittsburgh Penguins Message Board -  snagswolf     "Unless you can back it up I'll just write you off as just another Flyer fan talking out of his ass."       "F--k the Lady Byng!!! Get out there and kick some ass!"

      The Pittsburgh Penguins set a team record, scoring eight goals in one period (the second) vs. the San Jose Sharks.   Why couldn't they do that the other day??!!

      Some of the Stanley Cup Champion RedWings fell ill to a case of food poisoning on a recent flight from Dallas to Detroit. Now, I've flown to Detroit once and it does get you sick, but on the menu for the team were Cheesesteaks (hopefully not Philly style) and Coleslaw. Holstrom and Larionov were the most affected and the Wings to turn Dandenault into a makeshift foreward for today's game against St. Louis.   Sometimes these things happen, but I'd bet soon teams will add dietitians to their coaching staffs.

      Nothing says NHL hockey like soaking up the sun, beaches, palm trees, and Sheryl Crow.  On Decmber 10th, the NHL annonuced that the weekend concert called "NHL Block Party" (sponsored by Nextel) will have Grammy Award winning singer Sheryl Crow for the NHL All Star Game weekend. The concert itself is set to be February 2nd. It is $50 for "premium" seats, $35 for "reserved" seats, and $20 for General Admission.  I guess the NHL is going after the "easy-listening" crowd to expand their reported slumping fan base. I would rather see bands like Jimy Eat World, Disturbed, or a new band that I've heard played a lot lately - Trapped performing their hit single "Headstrong" to play a more Modern Rock concert.

      Who says star athletes don't get special treatment?  Peter Worell was arrested on June 16th of this year and sentenced to 10 days in jail for a DUI. According to the Associated Press, he does not have to report to jail until the team finishes it's season. Worrell, the Florida Panthers winger is supposed to turn in to the county jail on April 7th 2003! How many of you would like to choose your own punishment?  Along with jail time,. Worell was also fined $500, had his licence suspended for 5 years, and placed on probation for 1 year.

      Okay.. I'm torn.  On a mission to the College [Chinese] Buffet to feed a friend and I during late night working at WRSC studios... I was listening to our competitors in my car... just to spy and see what they were up to. While a commercial spot was running, they aired a local promo for ESPN Radio saying that they are the home for next Sunday's NHL all star games and games for the rest of the season. So, you know how much I love the game of hockey, but can it overcome my guilty feeling to listen to my competitors? If Nielson calls, I won't be eligible so I guess me listening doesn't count!  Tonight also marks the NHL debut of Konstantin Koltzov, the Belarussian player that they drafted in the first round in 1999 and had trouble signing. He spent most of the year in Scranton minors.  Also, I learned today that my hero Mario Lemieux would not play in the All-Star game because of a lingering groin injury.

      A good question was posed to the pundits at ESPN recently...     Hey! Of all the currently active players, who do you think would be the most deserving/likely to have a trophy named for them in the future? I'd say Ron Francis, Patrick Roy, or Lemieux. And do you think there will ever be a Gretzky Trophy?      My response..... I think there should be a  Mario Lemieux Ambassador of the Game of Hockey Award  someday.

      From a correspondant Kayla (Thanks, KayKayHoliday)... here is a few quotes from Gary Thorne and Bill Clement... the two biggest boneheads in the ESPN Hockey Broadcasting crew!    "I wonder why Martin Straka went over to his teammates Josef Stumpel before the faceoff"   Geez!! Since when are they teammates? Stumpel plays for Boston!    "Ian Moran and his little friends almost didn't play tonight, him, Dan LaCouture and Keith Primeau almost didn't play tonight cause of whiplash because of a fender bender on the way to the arena."    Keith Primeau plays in Philadelphia. I think he got confused with his brother Wayne who is in Pittsburgh. And I would like to know who the hell Ian Moran's little friends are!!!

      Well, it couldn't have lasted for Theo Fleury.  As reported from a Columbus strip club, Theo Fleury was involved in a fight suffering a black eye and bloody lip. Apparently, the NHL thinks he should get another chance since being on Stage 3 of the NHL's substance abuse policy. It is basically on probation status. The Blackhawks signed Theo in hopes to turn his act around after the NY Rangers (of all teams) dumped his sorry ass this past summer.  I am not surprised at this decision that NHL will allow Fleury to play after he blatantly broke his probation status. After what happened to Peter Worrell the other day (see blog entry dated 12/3/02) that athletes get special treatment when it comes to breaking the law.

Coached by my friend and Penn State Icers head man, Joe Batista, the USA squad comprised of Junior Hockey status players from Universities all over the country. They unfortunately lost today against team Finland 3-2 and are now winless in the first 2 qalifying rounds. They are set to play rivals Team Canada on Saturday.

      The NHL's longest active consecutive games played streak has just come to an end.  Tony Amonte sat out during the Coyotes game vs. the Nashville Predators due to a rib injury suffered at the previous game. The 8.5 year NHL veteran's streak lasted 453 games. Before that span, Amonte has only missed 2 other games in his career.  Talk about loving what you do for a living!  On a personal note, I have never really needed to take a day off during my jobs. I commend him for his work ethic and dedication.  Now, the record for consecutive games stands at 964 games by Doug Jarvis running from 1975 to 1987. The next closest guy to that is Maple Leafs defenseman, Robert Svehla at 343 games.

      I can't remember where I saw it last, but I once read over this article online about the state of hockey with regards to paying European players. Most European imports to the NHL perfer to be paid in American dollars (along with "smart" Canadians who know that our dollar is worth more). With the upcomming labor agreement... it is a posibility that a more feasable way to pay European players is to pay them in Euros with garunteed money.  I don't know what effect it will have on the hockey market, but it sounds like an interesting plan.

      "She's an Original," reads the front cover of Parade magazine, the Sunday newspaper insert. Avril Lavigne posed provocatively with microphone in her 18-year-old hands advertises the breif interview by columnist James Brady.  The cover insists that one of her favorite sports is hockey, she played on a boy's team from the age of 10!  Holy cow, she's awesome! Here's an excerpt from the online version of the article    In boys hockey there's a lot of body contact," she says. "I would've gotten killed on the ice. So I dropped out and played on a girls' team." Like most hockey fans, Lavigne is a big fan of the great Wayne Gretzky. "Gretzky is huge," she says. "He's still a hero in Canada. I'd like to meet him."

      Yesterday, my friend Dan and I took a trip to Pittsburgh to see the Penguins. It was a long trip from the middle of PA, but it was worth it going home again.  We get there and I was supposed to meet a friend of mine, but things got crossed up and I got in before with tickets. After we sat down in Mellon Arena, a row of obknoxious people kept getting up for beer. I guess they missed the announcement to wait in your seats unil the next period and be considerate to other fans.  The game between the Penguins and Senators was a shutout. Unfortunately, it was a shutout for the Senators. They won 3-0.  Hedberg the goaltender tried - really, he did.  The second goal was scored by Marrian Hossa and the other two was scored by an AHL call up that I never heard of. For the Penguins, my first look at the new acquirees proved just what the rest of the Penguins fans on the Penguins message boards were expecting. God, WE WERE TERRIBLE!  On the way out, it was just as frustrating as watching the game. To redeem the cupons that all fans received entering the Mellon Arena, Dan and I had to go through this labarynth of hallways down to gate three to pick up the Joe Mullen bobblehead collectable.

      As soon as I got up, I knew it was going to be a bad day. I woke up this morning with a bad headache that left me incapacitated for at least most of the morning and afternoon. Later on, I got up (a hot shower really helped) and visited my buddy Dan. The day just got worse!   "Hey, guess what.... they traded Kovalev!!" says my radio partner, Dan, as I walk into the door.  Prior to this, all he did was make jokes and tell me they traded Kovy. This time, I didn't want to believe him. Sure enough, I looked at all the Internet sites and it was plastered there in big black lettered headlines.  I still didn't want to believe it.

      The first period was missed due to my covering the Penn State Wrestling on WRSC, but I did get to see the better part of the show. Danny Heatly of the Atlanta Thrashers (ick!) scored 4 goals and became the youngest player by one day to have done that in an All-Star game. The action was really fast and ended with a fantastic display of goalie saves that took a 4-4 tie into overtime. Even the casual fan could tell that the players were actually getting into it and tried their best to get the game winning goal. Both Marty Turco of the Dallas Stars and Patrick Lalime of the Ottawa Senators were phenominal in goal in the third period. My boy Marian Gaborik even had a chance for the game winner at the very end, but clanked it off the post.  It took a shootout to determine the winner! Three of the five Western Stars had scored for their Conference to secure the game victory, but Danny Heatly had the last laugh. With a toothless grin, he won the MVP and a new Chevy Blazer.  I'm going to look forward to going next year to Minnesota!!

      Yesterday was the skills competition. I had stayed up late to see the replay on ESPN last night. I was really impressed with the Young Stars or Rookie All-Star game. Although there was only two names I actually recognized, the speed of these players coasting up and down the ice was amazing. Of course, the idea of a running clock probably had them in a "hurry-up" offense too!  The Skills competition by the other veteran all stars was not too bad. The Western Division won 15-8 I believe. The most impressive thing was seeing Martin St. Louis stretch out and beat one of the faster stars in the NHL, Teemu Selane in a puck-control relay race. The objective was a full sprint down the length of the ice and then weaving back through maintaining control of a puck. I have to be glad for Marian Gaborik who turned out to be the fastest skater with the quickest lap time. The oddest thing, and probably overlooked, was that the Toronto Maple Leafs were not represented. Ed Belfour and Mats Sundin were both selected to go, but had to bow out at the end. They didn't bother to replace them with another teammate. I guess it was an oversight.  If the Penn State Wrestling doesn't go overtime, I may just make the beggining of the All-Star Game that starts at 2:30 PM Eastern time on ABC. Be sure to read here what I thought about the whole show either later tonight or tomorrow evening.

      There may be hope for the National Hockey Leage as it announced a brand new mareting agreement with the appropriately named, "The Hockey Company".  I can't write it any better than the paragraph or two mentioned in the article taken from NHL.com.   To capitalize on the opportunities and new demands of the agreement, The Hockey Company and the NHL will create a Research and Design Center in Montreal dedicated to developing innovative, high performance apparel products. The new NHL/THC Research and Design Center will serve as a key resource for the development of the NHL Member Teams' authentic uniforms. The agreement also includes an annual multi-million dollar marketing commitment from THC to the NHL and each of the 30 Member Teams.

      I'm sure that you've seen some of the  Best Buy commercials where the customers get lost in their daydreams while playing with the displays. While watching ESPN waiting for the Thursday night game to come back on, I was really genuinely surprised at the commercial I saw next.  A man dressed in street clothes was on the rink in the middle of a game. It seems as if he is the only one playing. Ducking and weaving on the ice, but from out of nowhere and before he is pancaked along the boards by 4 NHL hockey players in full gear (and recognizable jerseys) he passes to his female companion (wife/girlfriend/mistress??) who is also in street clothes, does this great little spin move at center ice and then throws a backhand through the goaltender for a goal! From there the fantasy scenario turns to some reality as the man and lady were shopping at Best Buy  The recognizable team was the Minnesota Wild featured in the commercial. This would make sense since the Best Buy Company has their home office in Minneapolis, MN.

      Ever since I talked about the controversial and shocking story of fans booing the National Anthem, "some guy" named Don Cherry waxes poetic on the issue, which in turn creates a bigger issue. Should athletes and celebrities way in on the war; swaying public opinion? This article from  urlLink  Mark Spector  of the National Post delivers an opinion column of the way Cherry addressed the war. In the segment "Coaches Corner" in CBC's broadcast of Hockey Night in Canada, legendary NHL coach Don Cherry gave support to the U.S. for the war on terrorism and condemned his Canadian contrymen for being disrespectful to America for their lack of support.  Don Cherry, always a stand up guy, chose to take some flack, but has not strayed from his "old school" views.

      Since I had been early to work, I chose to go to the QWK Rock studio next door and talk to the young lady working Saturday mornings.  She had on this long sleve red t-shirt on. I noticed that there was a little logo on it that looked like the state of Idaho. The blond female D.J. told me that she was originally from there and it was an  urlLink  Idaho Steelheads  t-shirt. She told me that is where she was originally from.  I researched the franchise after I told her that I wasn't that familiar with the team. The Steelheads are an WCHL minor league team that plays other west coast teams. The WCHL is comprised of several teams in cities like Las Vegas, Fresno, San Diego, Bakersfield, Long Beach and Ankorage. Idaho is in first place in the WCHL with 100 pts after 65 games played.

It is our firm belief that this kind of behaviour has no place in the context of professional sports. The Montreal Canadiens organization has always held a high respect for its neighbours and friends in the United States, and we look forward to maintaining this strong and positive relationship. We apologize to anyone who may have been offended by this incident, and would encourage all fans at the Bell Centre to conduct themselves in a manner worthy of our game and our two great nations."

Marie Greyhounds $50,000 and suspended former coach and general manager John Vanbiesbrouck indefinitely from the league for the racial slur (the "n" word") he directed at team captain Trevor Daley.  "It is imperative that the Ontario Hockey League make a strong and unambiguous statement to the effect that any statements or comments of this nature will not be tolerated by the league," Branch said in a release. Vanbiesbrouck may apply after five years for reinstatement, he said.    Cute, guys. Real cute.  I am not in the kind of mood to hear this news. I'm not defending at all for what he did, it was wrong and that word should be erased from American-English lingo, but my gosh!! The thought police are on a roll! Way to take a man's livelyhood for one stupid remark.  Like I said.. I'm not having a good week and just reports like this are rubbing me the wrong way.

      Tonight Martin Straka scored his 500th career point against the Detroit Red Wings at home by scoring a terrific backhanded goal on Manny Legace. Congrats to him! Unfortunately, The Pens lost another one 5-1 tonight.

      Well, the deadline for the NHL to trade was at 1 PM MST.  Many teams went nuts trading for draft picks, vying for the best player to get them either into the playoff hunt or carried through the Stanley Cup playoffs.  Lots of key veterans, overpriced and taking up salary on teams that can't afford to keep them, guys like Tone Amonte wound up with his best frien Jeremy Roenick and the Philadelphia Flyers. Phil Housley went to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with old man Doug Gilmour.  If you are a Penguins fan, you are pissed like me to see the entire team get thrown away and young guys only making $40,000 a year.

      Congratulations to Mats Sundin for scoring his 1,000 career point in a game at Edmonton yesterday. Upon returning to the bench, he picked up the puck, pitched it to a equipment manager and plopped down in his seat. Job well done, Mats!

      After returning to State College from a breif vacation to see my brother perform as  The Near Professionals , I checked my email & the news around the NHL world.  I was surprised to see that the San Jose Sharks had traded Owen Nolan to the Toronto Maple Leafs. In return, they got Alyn McCauley and Erie Otters standout Brad Boyes.  The trade looks great to the Maple Leafs who are looking to a strong push towards the playoffs. Their offence was lagging a little and looked for a way to boost a quiet Mats Sundin. I was really impressed with Brad Boyes having seen him play in Erie for major Junior OHL hockey. He looked to be a great prospect. Both new S.J. Sharks Boyes and McCauley have both been rumored to be offered to the Penguins for Alexei Kovalev.  The trading deadline for the National Hockey League is March 11th.

      Okay... so I got my brother, my best friend, and my radio co-worker into a Yahoo! Fantasy Hockey league over the internet. For the most of the begining of the season, I was ahead in point totals. Then, people started to lose interest because it wasn't fair that the one guy running the leage was ahead. It wasn't any fun.  After teaching some tricks and advising the other players, I found myself and my team in a serious scoring slump. I am now in last place. The  Ruthless Agression  has now been reduced to a mild advancement.  I have now decreed that for the rest of the year my players will wear a patch with " WTF "

      This week's   The Hockey News   has a cover story that has the hockey world gone ape shit.  Sergei Fedorov, center for the Detroit Red Wings has admitted in an article that he did have a serious fling with tennis/model (and fellow Russian) Anna Kournickova. In the article, he admits to a brief marriage to her. Something like this was kept a very closely guarded secret, but comments by Barry Melrose would have you believe that it is not that big of a deal to a hockey team such as a Detroit. They all new about Sergei and Anna's relationship.  I think Sergei is one of the luckiest guys on the Earth! But much like most Hollywood marriages, it never works out due to conflicts in interest. Stars and famous celebrities often marry or "hook up" because very few people can relate to fame the way other stars do. Sergei and Anna have simmilar cultures and used to the limelight, working in America they more than likely formed a common bond. However, the questionable nature of their relationship is that Anna is very very young. Sergei and Anna were also never in the same country together long enough to make a relationship work. The constant traveling and touring that celebrity pro athletes have to do is very stressful and makes for a life of living out of a suitcase. Their eventual split was no doubt an effect of the afformentioned problems.

      While flipping through the channels & getting my weekly Monday Night "Stratusfaction". I watched a little bit of the NY Rangers and NY Islanders game. During the intermission, the ESPN Commentators John Buccigross and Barry Melrose gave their picks for the Stanley Cup Finals.   Barry: New Jersey and Dallas John: Toronto and Detroit   I would like to agree with fellow Pittsburgh fan Buccigross be right, but Barry knows the teams better. Since I hope Pittsburgh overachieves and sneaks into the playoffs I'd natually pick them for the finals. Realistically, I'd want the two other favorite teams to root for to get to the playoffs. I have a growing respect for the history and tradition for the Toronto Maple Leafs. They have a realistic chance of making it in the Stanley Cup finals representing the Eastern Conference. The team that surprised the leage in the Western Conference is the team currently sitting in 6th place. The Minnesota Wild should surprise somebody and play spoilers in the playoffs like the San Jose Sharks a few years ago.   Mike: Ottawa and Vancouver

Jaromir Jagr is not on the Czech Republic roster since the Capitals reached the first round of the playoffs. Many of Canada's stars turned out on thier roster. In the peliminary rounds already, USA lost to Denmark and Canada defeated team Belarus. Since when did Denmark get a hockey powerhouse????

      Okay! The first round is over... time now for the elite 8 in the NHL to survive to the Conference finals.   Eastern Conference   Philadelphia vs. Ottawa  In a rematch of last season's first round, Ottawa and Philadelphia square off in what is sure to be another classic playoff series. Tony Amonte has to score a hole lot more to prove acquiring him for the sole reason of the playoffs wasn't a bust. It's time to start serving the Wheaties in the locker rooms. The Senators proved that they didn't need Yashin to not get "voted off the island" and sent the former holdout with the resurgent Islanders packing. The Senators are the top seed in the East and it will be just as difficult eliminating them as chopping down the 6 ft. 9 in. "tree" named Zedno Chara.  Prediction: Senators in 6     New Jersey v. Tampa Bay  The second seated Devils had a short time taking care of Boston in the first round. Though New Jersey had them on the ropes early in the series, Boston was eliminated in 5 games. Martin Brodeur continues to be the clutch goaltender he always was stopping a barrage of shots day in and day out. The matchup of the series is Brodeur versus Martin St. Louis who took more capital offense in the last series. This is the furthest that the Lightning have traveled in the playoffs, so the underdog Tampa Bay team has low expectations on their side.  Prediction: Devils in 5    Western Conference   Minnesota vs. Vancouver  NHL Playoff hockey has not been played in Minnesota in 10 years since. The tremendous support that the Wild franchise got in the first round proved moving the Stars to Dallas was a huge mistake. It took 7 games to shockingly upset the strong Avalanche franchise. Overtime helped the Wild get a second chance at winning taking their last two games into OT. The Wild are also undefeated when they score the first goal this year. Vancouver is also a team that had to fight back from being on the brink of elimination. Marc Crawford's teams always come ready to play and are poised on representing the Western Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.  Prediction: Wild in 7    Dallas v. Anaheim  If you checked my predictions in the first round, somebody was going to be swept, but who'd thought it was going to be the defending Stanley Cup champions. I'll admit that the Mighty Ducks shocked even me when they sent Detroit to the geriatric ward. The Ducks got "jiggy" with it and never looked back. Dallas once again proved to be the Oilers nemesis in the playoffs and fought off a tremendous crowd support in the Skyreach Center last series. The Ducks must remove the rust and shoot for the stars to continue to the next round.  Prediction: Stars in 7

      I enjoyed watching NHL 2night crew get ready for the upcomming games as they planned a segment featuring comedian Denis Leary.  Denis is a long time hockey fan and helps organize a celebrity show for the Neely house. Being a Boston native, Leary sported the Bruins away jersey and struck a pose or two. His message was short and only to bash the heck out of Barry Melrose. His verbal parsings targeted Barry's mullett. Of course, Barry being the good sport he is, took things in stride and even threw in a few insults of his own by laughing at Denis' choice of favorite teams.  I guess you had to be there. It was really funny.

Coach Kehoe has spent years behind the bench as an assistant coach to the Penguins team, a team that he recently spent more than 25 years in association with. No word as to who the successor will be or if Rick will be maintained as a scout or assistant coach with the Penguins for the 2003-04 NHL season.

      The NHL playoffs have begun and already there have been some great games played out with the bracketed matchups that the NHL provided. Fighting it out in 4th and 5th seeds respectively are the Toronto Maple Leafs and Philadelphia Flyers. These teams have had a long history in the past and the series has proved to be an exiting one. However, the Maple Leafs were reminded of their past when  urlLink  a Flyers fan brought a law suit  from an incident two years ago. The Flyers fan is suing for damages after alegedly had been provoked into leaping the plexi-glass while being taunted by known goon Tie Domi.  "It might be Philly trying to stir up something two years later because we're playing against them. It's two years later but, who knows, I wouldn't put it past Philly,"  Domi said.   Since my beloved Penguins are not in the playoffs this year, many Pittsburgh fans have asked me who should we root for now? I gave them this advice:  1.) True Penguins fans NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER root for the Flyers. If it was a game between the Flyers and Iraq with Saddam Hussein and his sons as the top line, You still don't root for the Flyers!

This WWE Diva is standing as the Women's Champion and hailing from Toronto, Canada. Nobody comes out of Toronto or lives there and not be a Leafs fan. On Spike TV's WWE Confidential program shows a recent tour of her home, Trish showed off her action figure collection, complete with CuJo and Mats Sundin. I have another photo of her in a NHLPA jersey. It's one of my favorites of her.

      Tonight, I was watching the resurgent edition of NHL 2night on ESPN2 and the usual suspects were behind the anchor desk. John Buccigross, Barry Melrose, and Ray "Parm" Ferraro.  During one break, Barry teased his friend John by calling him "Ashley Banfield" because of the glasses that John wears are simmilar to the MSNBC info-babe.When they came back from the break, John re-introduced himself by naming his co-anchors and reffering to himself as "Ashley Banfield".  I got a good laugh out of that. It only supports the belief that Buccigross and all the self-deprocating humor (especially in his ESPN.com colums) that make him out to be a nice guy.

      Okay.. for starters.. lemme just say that John Buccigross is a great guy... he has a great sense of humor and I think he sees things on the  right  side - if ya know what I mean.  The Stanley Cup Playoffs begins tomorrow night and people and pundits are ringing in with their predictions. I think I'll do the same.    Eastern Conference    Ottawa v. NY Islanders Ottawa enters in with a few negatives. 1. The President's Trophy winners don't have an above average chance to win it all. The Detroit Red Wings were the first team to break that curse last year. 2. Ottawa is still strapped for cash, they need to win to earn more money. 3. Alexei Yashin is an Islander now. Their once top pick has come back wearing a new uniform. The Islanders have proven that they can win, but dealing Osgood to St. Louis will prove to be their downfall.  Prediction: Ottawa in 6   New Jersey vs. Boston Boston's managerial and upper management got a shake up when they fired Robie Ftorek their coach and the GM is now sitting in temporary. Glen Murray and the B's have been on a mission all season long to return the once proud franchise back to it's legendary status, New Jersey is riding on the hot goalie in Martin Brodeur. They also contain a lot of veterans from Dallas in a blockbuster trade a while back. The Devils are the experienced playoff franchise. Sorry Beantown, you'll get 'em next year.  Prediction: Devils in 5   Tampa Bay vs. Washington If you asked who the higher seed is in this series, you'd be surprised that Tampa Bay won the Southeastern division over their rivals Washington. Tampa has been quietly making waves thanks to their good goaltending in Graham and Khabibulin. Jaromir Jagr is "dying alive" with his skills in Washington and fighting the discomforting process of healing a broken wrist. Peter Bondra scored 2 goals in their last regular season game. Look for the Caps and my Uncle (in the PR office) to find a lightning rod and control the young and inexperienced 'Bolts.  Prediction: Capitals in 4    Philadelphia vs. Toronto The two teams taht made the major deals to re-tool and improve for a serious playoff run find themselves against one another in the first round. Roenick has his buddy Amonte back and are playing well. Hitchcock has coached the Stanley Cup Stars; he knows what it takes to make it for the long haul. Toronto awaits their return on investment with goalie Ed Belfour and RW Owen Nolan. The Leafs look stronger and battle tested than Flyers goaltender Checkmanek. The Flyers are looking at another first round exit if Amonte and Roenick can't score.  Prediction: Maple Leafs in 7  .    Western Conference   Dalas vs. Edmonton The Stars were the best team in the Western Conference earning the home ice advantage throughout the playoffs. The new world Oilers retooled themselves for a better showing in the playoffs this year. Dvorak for Carter will prove that it was a lopsided trade in favor of New York. Tommy Salo treats every shot like a sweedish meatball. Dalas has the kind of firepower to knock a few of those back in on 2nd and 3rd tries.  Prediction: Stars in 6   Detroit vs Anaheim The Mighty Ducks are the surprise team in the playoffs. Led by Peter Sykora and Paul Karya, Anaheim is a scoring threat that could hold their own. However, Detroit is a team that has the right mix of age and youth. They can score like water off a mallard's back. Brett Hull scored over 700 goals for his career this season and won't hesitate to score some more. Detroit is the defending champions and will play like that through the series. Curtis Joseph is trying to achieve what he couldn't for Edmonton or Toronto. Maybe the agless veterans on Detroit's team all retire at once for going out on top.  Prediction: Wings in 4   Colorado vs. Minnesota In a surprising turn of events, the Minnesota Wild fought hard to get a playoff berth in only their third season. The young team is lead by Slovak phenom Marian Gaborik and the defensive trap system. Colorado had a bum year losing Joe Sakic for most of the first part of the season due to injury. Patrick Roy hasn't looked like his old self this year and even let the team down when Minnesota won a few games at their expense. This is a tough call because Minnesota is good enough to shock some people, but Colorado has the dominant team.  Prediction: Avalanche in 6   Vancouver vs. St. Louis It's put up or shut up for Vancouver. The hottest team in the league scoring wise is Vancouver with Bertuzzi, Naslund and Brendan Morrison as the saviors of most fantasy leauge teams. They gave the defending champs Detroit a run for their money last year in the playoffs and the fans support their efforts to give it another go. St. Louis stands in their way this year bringing back captain Chris Pronger from injury. The Blues were treading water with the goaltending they had only to pick up Chris Osgood at the trading deadline. Also, look for newly acquired Mr. Candice Cameron (Valerie Bure) to make an impact in the playoffs.  Prediction: Cannucks in 5

      Continuing the debate about talking heads and TV personalities commenting about the War in Iraq, I found an article at  urlLink  Faceoff.com  that says CBC completely hung out their most popular and controversial personality Don Cherry out to dry.  The article says that the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) gave a statement that the comments that Cherry made on Hockey Night in Canada about the war in Iraq was his opinion and did not necessarily reflect the views of the CBC or it's management. They felt compelled to release a statement after being deluged by letters of complaints.  Cherry came out and supported the U.S. in the war against terrorism.

       World Cup 2004  - Toronto, Canada  urlLink  NHL.com article     The tournament, a joint effort staged by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association, in cooperation with the International Ice Hockey Federation, will feature the national teams from the top eight hockey-playing nations in the world. Tournament organizers discussed many of the preliminary details of the tournament during Wednesday afternoon's press conference at the Air Canada Centre, which will host the final game Sept. 14, 2004. "It's a real honor for us to be the host of the championship game for the World Cup of 2004," Ken Dryden, Toronto Maple Leafs President, said. "We are very pleased to have preliminary round games here, a quarterfinal game, a semifinal game and the final game of the 2004 World Cup." According to organizers, the tournament's final will be a one-game affair, as opposed to the best-of-three format that was used in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, and also in several Canada Cups. Canada, the United States, Russia, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia and Germany are scheduled to take part in the tournament.

      Earlier today, "St." Patrick Roy announced his retirement from the NHL after an 18 year career.  Regarded as thee best goaltender in the history of pro hockey, he owns many NHL records including most wins. He also holds 3 Stanley Cup rings he won with Montreal and Colorado. The French Canadian was highly criticized for his departure in Montreal after a contract dispute with owners. He then went on to rival organization Quebec/Denver and won two Stanley Cups with them. Oh, yea, he also assaulted his wife after a temper tantrum that included ripping a closet door off it's hinges.  After one full year of  Confessions of a Hockey Fanatic  I began talking about Patrick Roy. Fitting that I now post about him one year later.  In other goalie news, the scapegoat of Flyers fans, Roman Cechmanek was traded to the L.A. Kings for a second round draft pick. Poor Felix Potvin, looks like he's on the move again from L.A. Potvin was in Toronto and was outplayed by Curtis Joseph and in Vancouver wore out his welcome. No word yet if Felix "the cat" will accept a backup or a pack up role.

      In my last installment to the Stanley Cup predictions, here is how I think the teams match up.   Stanley Cup Finals   New Jersey Devils vs. Mighty Ducks of Anahem  This series might not be the match-up that will bring in all kinds of interest continent wide, (especially in Canada when they get pissed off when an American team wins the Cup) when neither team are among the elite franchises in the league. The Mighty Ducks, a Disney company/team, are in their first Stanley Cup finals ever. They sport Paul Karyia as their team captain and best player. They also have a few former Devils on the team having worked a few trades at the deadline and in the previous off-season. Peter Sykora looks to get his third championship ring as a member of the Ducks. The Ducks have to battle the iddleness waiting 11 days for the Eastern Conference to finish up. J.S. Giguere, the phenom goaltender, hopes that he could carry them though one more series.The Devils are a determined crew of hard hitting defensive minded franchise. Scott Stevens is their Captain and team leader. This defenceman leads with his shoulder. They've been able to win the Stanley Cup twice in their history.However, Pat Burns, their coach, has never been able to win it coaching other teams. The Devils have a star goaltender that can take control of the game and shut an opposing team down. Martin Brodeur will be huge in this series. It will be a series of which goaltender can be better. Prediction: Devils in 6

      Who would name their arena  urlLink Gaylord Entertainment Center  anyway?  The Nashville Predators the 5 year old NHL expansion team has filed a lawsuit against Gaylord Entertainment Company for not paying in January for the naming rights to the arena.  This is getting silly, folks. With the issues of Enron and the internet website that had the naming rights to Baltimore Raven's field, I think stories like this should change the minds of pro teams who get corporate sponsors. At least, they should be more thorough in their investigations and not give the rights over to the highest bidder.

      The summer of 2003 issue of Hockey Digest has an article covering the tragic story of a youth hockey player near Pittsfield, Mass.  Quinn Connelly, according to the article, was diagnosed with the learning disability called dyslexia. But Quinn would find an outlet for his frustration by finding something he was good at and something he loved - hockey. His sister was his biggest supporter and fan. However, tragedy struck in early December of 2000 where Quinn was at practice. Quinn dove his body out with the purpose of blocking a shot. He turned his head back only to have the shot strike the back of the neck. It's the one small part on a hockey player that is not protected. The 1 oz. solid rubber puck crushed two arteries that connected to the brain. Quinn later died at the area hospital. The Connally family want to give his son a lasting legacy and build a two rink sports facility for the Massachusetts community. You can read and donate to the Memorial fund by clicking on the  urlLink  Quinn's Legacy Foundation  link.

      Today, the World Championships of International Hockey is set for the Gold Medal Game. Sweden will take on Canada tomorrow. Though the teams did not match the same "dream team" rosters from the Salt Lake Olympics, both teams are stocked with NHL talent from their home country. The loser of this game will earn the Silver medal and second place. In the Bronze medal game, the defending World champion Slovakia will face their traditional rivals of Team Czech Republic.It's a dissapointing finish for Slovakia who had high expectations of repeating as champions. Czech Republic a hockey powerhouse in recent years hopes they return to their former glory since winning the Gold Medal in the Nagano Olympics. This is the biggest match between the two countries since they parted ways more than 9 years ago. In a sureal turn of events, the two teams will have to face goaltenders who work together in the NHL. Tomas Vokoun (Czech) and Jan Lasak (Slovak) both play goal for the Nashville Predators.

      Well, I blew it big time! I had to leave Hooters last night because they were closing at midnight and the third period had just started. I can't believe that I missed a great comeback from the Minnesota Wild to win 4-2!  So far I am 66% correct on the Playoff Round Predictions. (Hey, a blind squirrell finds a nut every now and then)     Eastern Conference   Ottawa v. New Jersey  The team that just won't go away in the Eastern Division is the Ottawa Senators. They feature a European scoring threat of Alfredson (captain), Hossa and Havlat. Despite filing for bankrupsy, the Senators have continued to find ways to win - including winning the President's Trophy as the team that won the most points in the standings.The undersized and defensive minded New Jersey Devils have been riding the coat-tails of goaltender Martin Brodeur. Headmanned by Pat Burns, this team looks primed for their third Stanley Cup.  Prediction: Ottawa in 6      Western Conference   Anaheim vs. Minnesota  Hot Goaltenders have been the major focus in this years playoffs. J.S. Giguere has taken the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim the furthest the NHL franchise has ever gotten. They shut down Detroit in 4 and hope to do the same to Minnesota. The current goal and point leader in the playoffs is phenom Marian Gaborik. He hopes to score Minnesota into the finals who haven't been there in 10+ years.  Prediction: Mighty Ducks in 5

      Tonight, the Minnesota Wild will make history in the NHL as they play Game 7 in Conference semi-finals tonight against the Vancouver Cannucks.  The Minnesota Wild, comming off a 7 game series defeating the vaunted Colorado Avalance when they were down 3 games to 1 now travel to Vancouver tonight to accomplish the unthinkable. The 3 year old expansion franchise is in their first year of post season play. If they win tonight, they will be the first team in NHL history to come from behind 3-1 twice in the same year.  ... Told ya it was going to 7 games! *wink*  I'll be watching the game from a comfy seat at Hooters!

      Come on everybody... sing along with me... "na na na na..na na na na.. hey hey hey... goodbye!"   The Flyers lost tonight to the Ottawa Senators 5-1. They should really consider getting a new goaltender over the summer. Chechmanek is the softest goaltender in the league. I watched the game tonight and 7 minutes into the game the Flyers are down 2-0. The first goal catches Cechmanek out of position. Two more goals were also scored just like that. Ottawa just put the puck into the empty net.  Philly's big scorers Primeau, Amonte, Roenick, et al only managed 2 or 3 goals the whole series. The offensive production is what eventually got them in the end.  Ottawa moves on to the Eastern Conference Finals against another Penguins rival - New Jersey.

I always say, and I know it sounds funny, is that I'd like a male Trish Stratus someone who's quirky, with a good sense of humour and into jokes. I like sports, to watch movies and just to chill out, so if they like that then they could be my man."   Sounds like me to a "t"!      Oh.. here comes another mention that I need to get out of the way..   Thanks to Hootress, Jay Currie, and the Elephant Rants by linking my website on theirs.

The loss would have had made team USA play a few more games to qualify to the Olympic tournament in Tourin, Italy.

      In a somewhat shocking move, the Penguins organization has fired the Wilkes Barre - Scranton coach Glen Patrick.  I remember talking to him early last fall during one of the PSU icers games and interviewing him on my station WRSC. He spoke about developing talent to the NHL level - something that he and the organization was always blamed for. Glen convinced me that he did hve a lot of hockey knowledge and could be a very compitent coach elsewhere.    "After reviewing all of the circumstances, we decided it was time to make a change,"  said Penguins GM and brother Craig Patrick.  Glenn Patrick compiled a record of 115-152-38-15 in four seasons with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. His son Curtis played for PSU and Team USA in the World University Games in Italy earlier this year.

      My friend Jim would be interested in this story...  NHL.com says that the NY Rangers and the Edmonton Oilers have come to an agreement to send the rights of aging veteran defenceman Brian Leetch up north for backup goalie Jussi Markkannen.  On the surface, it looks like a good deal, but if you think about it, it doesn't make sense for NY. The Rangers let go one of their leaders for another goaltender when they already have a platoon of goaltenders to start with. Blackburn, Richter, and Dunham have all been established as the #1 guy. Plus, this doesn't mean that Leetch will even put on a Oilers jersey, he has to sign a free agent contract first.

      Besides covering my favorite teams here, I think I should mention a few news-worthy items for the rest of the league happening since Blogger was converting my account to the upgraded version.  1. Dominick Hasek wanted to go out a champion and retire to spend more time with his family in the Czech Republic. After a year, Hasek has considered a return to the Red Wings. I guess he sat at home and watched the team leave the playoffs after 4 game sweep made him wonder.  2. Bondra and Halpern have decided to go down with the ship re-signing with the one team that seems to always be going nowhere. The Washington Capitals exercised their contract options on their players.  3. Toronto GM/Coach is now just a coach. Pat Burns demoted himself as a part of the upper management to the club. President and one heck of a former NHL goalie Ken Dryden also stepped down as team president. No word was said to when the positions would be replaced. (Gentlemen, get your resumes ready!)  4. "Mr. Candice Cameron" was picked up by his former team he was traded from at last years deadline. Valeri Bure was released by the St. Louis Blues and picked up by the Florida Panthers solidifying the idea that the NHL trading deadline is the "rent a player for the playoffs" sweepstakes.

      In a shocking move, my hometown Pittsburgh Penguins moved up to get the #1 pick in the draft and used it on highly sought after goalie Marc-Andre Fleury. They traded up with the Florida Panthers who selected in the number three spot. Here is the top 5 selections in the first round.   1. Marc-Andre Fleury (G) - Pittsburgh 2. Eric Staal (C) - Carolina 3. Nathan Horton (C) - Florida 4. Nikolai Zherdev (W) - Columbus 5. Thomas Vanek (LW) - Buffalo   In Nashville, TN the host sity of the draft, the Nashville Predators selected defenceman Ryan Suter with the 7th pick overall.  With a very classy move, the NHL paid respect to the memory of Roger Neilson who died this morning. He was currently serving as assistant coach of the Ottawa Senators. He also worked for Florida, Philly, NY Rangers, and other teams. When represenatives of teams Neilson worked for, they expressed their condolances. They also paused for a moment of silence. Roger Neilson died of cancer at his home in Peterborough, Ontario at the age of 69.

      Today, I laced up my CCM's and hit the rink as Penn State's favorite rink rat and skated the public session at the Penn State Ice Pavilion from 1 to 3 PM. It felt great to get back on the ice after a long month's layoff! I had a wide open rink to myself through most of the first hour, then at 1:55 the PA system played " Bring Me To Life " by Evanescence and " Fighter " by Christina Aguilera. That helped propell me even faster around the rink as I pushed myself to skate harder and faster. The great news is that I can skate backwards better!      Then I went to the local mall and found a Franklin SX Pro Extreme In-line Hockey Goalie's Mask reduced from a lot of money to very very affordable money! It was probably last years model. It's a black mask with a skull of a fanged creature of some sort. It looks pretty fearsome. I have an idea that if I am not satisfied with the look, I just may take the helmet to a air brush place and get something really interesting on it! Like a Trish Stratus tribute!

He is expected to meet with Glen Sather and the Los Angeles Kings next week. I wonder if his family will approve this move. The former coach of the NJ Devils is a higly sought after no nonsense coach. According to this quote from the New York Daily News; he knows how to get things done.    "I coach a certain way and I'm not going to change my philosophy because somebody else feels the game should be played a certain way. It would be my rear end on the line. And if it is, I'm going to do it my way."   Kick Ass!

      It's Hockey Hall of Fame selection time again. You know that you're getting old when players you remember watching as a kid are retired and getting into the Hall.  The first black hockey player to get into the Hall is Grant Fuhr. He rose to fame by goaltending for the really really good Edmonton Oilers during their dynasty run. He then moved on to other teams, most notably with St. Louis. He won 5 Stanley Cups with Edmonton and won several championships representing his native Canada in international tournament play. No mention that he was once in trouble for substance abuse.  Pat LaFontaine is one of the few members of the NHL that have played for all three NY teams. During his 15 year carreer he jumped from the USA Olympic team to the NY Islanders. He then became captain for the Buffalo Sabres, and only played one season with the NY Rangers before sustaining a career ending head injury in 1998. Today, Pat LaFontaine raises money for cancer and promotes the Pat LaFontaine chalenge cup to the winner of the Islanders/Rangers rivalry game.

      Well... the search is over... and the Pittsburgh Penguins have decided to go in an unexpected direction.  The Penguins have chosen former color analyst and former player Eddie Olczyk to be the next head coach for the franchise. New fans would recognize his voice as the NHL Radio announcer for this years Stanley Cup playoffs. He was also partnered with Hall of Famer Mike Lang for 3 seasons for the local Penguins broadcasts.  I guess this was as much a monetary decision as much as it has been a directional descision. Names like Herb Brooks, Larry Robinson, and the like would have commanded a high salary to coach the money strapped team. They probably got "Edzo" for cheap.  The  mother of all rumors ... with a big emphasis on the rumor part is that I will be named to replace "Edzo" soon.

      Congratulations to the  New Jersey Devils  as they won the 2002-03 Stanley Cup Championship last night in front of their home crowd. Pundits and critics talked about it being a home rink advantage in the series as both teams won their games at home. It was fortunate for the Devils to have Game 7 land in their favor.  A teary eyed J.S. "Jiggy" Giguere did in fact win the Playoff MVP as one of the rare times that the losing team's player had won the award.

      hmmm.. Somehow I overlooked the Civil War brewing among this Stanley Cup series. If you are not sure still of who to root for in the Finals, just ask Mr. and Mrs. Niedermayer.  Traded to the Mighty Ducks at the trading deadline this past season, Rob Niedermayer has enjoyed his first trip to the Finals. His older brother Scott has been a mainstay for the New Jersey Devils defence. He's already got two rings.  I guess they must have some additional motivation for the series. I have a brother and if these guys were as half as competitive as my brother and I, they want to win the Stanley Cup badly.  Rob and Scott aren't the only brothers to play in the NHL. Eric and Brett Lindros, Wayne and Keith Primeau, and Peter and Antonin Stasny are some of the better known Family legacy names.

Today, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim goaltender J.S. Giguere earned another overtime win in the playoffs over the Devils to extend his OT shutout streak record. Congratulations. I think he's won the Conn Smythe Trophy with his efforts this year. [Note, the trophy is given every year to the MVP of the playoffs]

According to a Yahoo.com Sports article, (and you could also check out the story on NHL.com) that Mario Lemieux will again lace up his skates to play for the Pittsburgh Penguins for the 2003-2004 season.  It's been received around the league with mixed emotions. Some people are still jealous of the greatest hockey player and think he's just doing it for money and/or self interest. Other fans like me think this is great for hockey to have him around one more year. The Penguins really need him to survive.

Michel Therrien was announced as the new head coach of the AHL minor league affiliate to the Pittsburgh Penguins. He was the head coach of the Montreal Canadiens in the NHL. But, his employers had little patience for re-building the franchise. When your a hockey fan in Montreal and French Canadian losing is not an option. So, what Canada's loss is Pennsylvania's gain.

In the summer meetings for the American Hockey League (AHL), the league commissioners voted in favor of realignment. The new divisions and conferences were marketed around local rivalries.  The "baby Pens" will compete against their rivals in the new Eastern Conference - East Division with: Bing-hampton (Sens), Albany (Devils), Philadelphia (Flyers), Hershey (Avalanche), Bridgeport (Islanders), Norfolk (Blackhawks).

      Well, since there isn't a whole lot of newsworthy events going, I'll tell you about my hockey dream I had the other night.  There wasn't much too it. I remember suiting up for the Penn State Icers. I was in the locker room and preparing for a game. I remember hopping up and down on my skates trying to get the adrenalin pumping. The anthem was playing, I was about to take the ice,  but.... I was approached by a real player who told me that I shouldn't be here, that I wasn't really a part of the team and that my services wasn't going to be needed.  Oh well, I wish it was a more pleasant dream. I was woken up by the alarm that next morning.

      The free agent signings started off with a bang by the announcement that the deep pocketed Colorado Avalanche have signed both friends Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne to million dollar one year contracts. The two wanted to play on the same team again since their first stint with the Mighty Ducks. The most shocking news is that they both chose to sign only one year deals, making them free agents again and most certainly affected by the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that will be voted on and go into effect in 2004. Subsequent to the retirement of Av's goalie Patrick Roy, Colorado's plan is "the best defense is a good offense!"  The Red Wings signed away one of their rivals best players in Dallas Star's Derian Hatcher. Hatcher was the Stars captain and big hitting defenceman, but Detroit gave him over a suspected million reasons to go home to Detroit. Dallas then announced that franchise Stars player Mike Modano will wear the "C" on his jersey next season.

Sather, the GM of the Rangers, took over when the Trottier experiment last season did not prove for the better. Pat Quinn tried this in Toronto. Look how they turn out!  Jeff "cant" Hackett signed a free agent deal with the Flyers. He couldn't do it in San Jose. He couldn't do it Montreal. He couldn't do it Boston. I swear this guy is on his 18th team in 2 years.

       Happy Canada Day!!   The Second Annual Canada Day Cup 2003. [Results]  Last years winners were the Edmonton Oilers who got past three rounds of very tough tournament action. They defeated a tough Nordiques squad to set the standard the first year. This is the rundown All original 8 canadian franchises (Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnepeg, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver) were simulated out in tournament fashion using NHL 2002 for EA Sports. This year, I decided to change it up a bit. Instead of a one-and-done format, I brought the up to date July 1 rosters and simulated an international tournament to first decide the tournament seatings. Then, I watched the final "gold medal" game between the Maple Leafs and the Avalanche (sporting their original Nordiques uniforms). The game was a classic. In the first period, Toronto took a couple of stupid penalties, but still squeezed out a 2-1 lead. Despite franchise players Sakic and Forsberg, Toronto scored 4 and added an empty net 5th goal. Aebisher stood on his head at times for the retired Roy, but his counterpart Ed Belfour was solid.  Toronto wins the second Canada Day Cup!  " Blame Canada, Blame Canada... they're not a real country anyway!! " JUST KIDDING!  Thanks, Canada for a great game, great beer, and a great woman [ urlLink Trish Stratus ]!

      Well, today's the last day in August... so it's the last chance to post something. Maybe I should update it more often, even when things aren't going as fast in the off-season.  My Penguins gave away one of their goalies in the "plethora" of goalies that they had. Johan "Moose" Hedberg was traded to the Vancouver Canucks for a second round draft pick. When, Caron got the bulk of the playing time, it looked as if he was "the chosen one" for goalie of the future.  That's all for now.. have a safe Labor Day weekend!

      In a follow up story to the tragic death of USA hockey's legends, Herb Brooks, several sources including Yahoo! Sports have said this...   Sen. Cal Larson (R-Fergus Falls) recommended Monday that the National Hockey Center in St. Cloud, MN should be called the Herb Brooks Arena.   The Gov. Tim Pawlenty said he'd think about it and talk to the people who own the Arena rights. It is home to the St. Cloud University men's and women's team by seating 6,000 and contains two Olympic size rinks.

      The Associated Press and NHL.com reports that legendary coach Herb Brooks was killed in a car accident in his home state of Minnesota today.  The entire hockey world is both shocked and saddened to learn the news. Mr. Brooks was the head coach for several NHL teams including the North Stars, Rangers, Devils, Penguins (funny how NHL.com article omitted that fact from the list) and was also the head coach for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team when they won the Gold Medal. He was currently the scouting coach for the Pittsburgh Penguins.  No doubt, the NHL will honor this man with memorial patches. Expect the Penguins to have one night of tribute for opening night.  Herb Brooks was 66 years young. He will be missed.

      Since today's date is really important to me, I would like to dedicate this entry to my patron saint. On that note, I would also like to make others aware of an Ontario Hockey League team by promoting them on this website. The  urlLink St. Michael's Majors  play up in Toronto, Canada. They have had a lot of distinguished alumni play for them. Rick Tocchet and Jason Spezza. But I use that term loosely as Eric Lindros also played his Junior career for the Majors.  The funniest thing about the team is that their mascot is named "Mikey." Their official web site is seen above.

      Knowing that the NHL 2004 from EA Sports came out yesterday, I ran to my nearest "Mart" and got a copy. I've been buying the EA Sports series since I've had my PS one.  I love the way that they have really updated the NHL series game from last year. Some of the new features of the game are similar to the Madden game where the game player can now become the team's GM in franchise mode. As GM, you can manage the salaries of the players, set ticket prices, and make trades. If your team is successful during the years, you can upgrade your simulated GM office. Other new features for the game that I really like is the on-line play where you can hook the Playstation up to the Internet and challenge others from around the globe. Secondly, since it's hooked up to the Internet you can also download player updates and new rosters. Speaking of rosters, EA Sports also cleaned up the mess of out of date rosters from the 2003 version. The team rosters are pretty up to date. Any free agents that were unassigned to a team can now be found in the Free Agents column. On 2002 version, a few complaints were raised that there was a small limit as to how many players could fit onto the rosters. Teams now begin with 4 or 5 goalies when 3 were the limit on past versions. Also, I was genuinely surprised that the Phoenix Coyotes were up to date with their new logo and uniforms. (See Sept. 4th blog entry) Last year, the Penguins had changed their jerseys, but it was too late to fix it in 2003's version. (It also made my decision not to buy last years for that reason.) They have also improved their fighting sequences by a new fight engine that provides a no-holds barred realism to the game. Instead of a button-mashing attack, instead you must strategize bunching the body and head. The helmets come off as you grapple for dominance. You may also chose when or when not to drop the gloves. Additionally, you are also rewarded by playing other EA Sports titles and in the beginning, you can chose your favorite team to appear as the wallpaper background to the menu screen. Getting to the few things that I don't like about the game is the incredible waste of space that putting the European elite leagues on the game. You can also chose to play as one of Sweden, Finland or Germany's elite league teams. I only know a couple of those teams thanks to the NHL expanding their interests to playing exhibition games there. Modo and Jokerit. In my humble opinion, they should have listened to their fans that enjoy the unique All-Star feature of the skills competition. EA's rival ESPN has included the skills competition in their hockey game this year. Look for the skills competition in NHL 2005. I am also having an adjustment period learning how to maneuver the players around the rink. EA Sports found it necessary to incorporate the analog joysticks on the PS 2 to get more realism to the game. EA Sports... If it's in the game...It's definitely in this game! (The makers of this game have not paid me to endorse their product... but if they wanted to...*wink*)

The top 8 teams automatically qualify for the Turin Olympic games.  Based on recent international competition wins and overall reputation, Canada was listed #1 like a national champions poll in NCAA Football. In no particular order... Slovakia, USA, Finland, Germany, Czech Republic, Sweden and Russia round out the top 8. The last place team was Turkey listed as 43rd. Turkey has a hockey team?

            Well.. the Toronto Maple Leafs are the ambassadors for NHL brand of hockey this month. They are currently playing exhibition games in Sweden. Yesterday, they defeated the Jokerit team 5-3. Newly acquired defenceman Richard Jackman (no, not the guy that played Wolverine... that's Hugh) scored twice for the Leafs. The lowlight for the Leafs was that team star Owen Nolan was the recipient of a check in the previously injured back. Later, he assured the fans and team on numerous websites including the  urlLink Leafs official page  that his back is fine. One thing for sure, team captain Mats Sundin played host as he hails from Sweden.

      When the announcement came that Richter called it a career, it was one down one to go.  Today, 20 year veteran Doug Gilmour announced his retirement from the NHL as a Maple Leaf. He played nobly for the Canadiens, Sabres, "Leaves", Flames, Blackhawks, and Devils. He won the Stanley Cup with the Flames in 1989. He also stands high on the all time scoring list putting in 450 goals and totaling 1,414 points.  I was amazed when Gilmour signed a contract to play one more year in Montreal last year. (check out my archives on what I said then). Gilmour was overdue for retirement, but gave his best shot for one last run.

       Don't be caught with the wrong jersey for the 2003-2004 season...   ...warns the scrolling internet banner advertisement.  The NHL will break with tradition and switch the jersey sweaters worn for all NHL teams during the season. The dark jerseys will now become the home jerseys and the away jerseys will be the white jerseys.  I think this is a terrible idea! This isn't the NFL! If it 'aint broke, don't fix it!

      The Phoenix Coyotes, owned by NHL Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky, has updated their look to the franchise by creating the new jerseys. You can check them out at this link  urlLink  Official Coyotes website .  I think they look terrible. They tried to incorporate the red and white of the Detroit Red Wings and ended up in the same vein as fashion victims the Carolina Hurricanes. The Coyote logo is a slight improvement.    The original press conference from the organization said that they were "going to incorporate the rich heritage of the franchise by honoring it's past." Everyone thought that this would be a nod to the Winnipeg Jets that the franchise started as. The Jets were blue. I don't see any blue.

      Too little too late for some people, but it came down to the personal honor as veteran goaltender Mike Richter has called a press conference. He is expected to announce his retirement from the NHL.  Richter spent the bulk of his time on the IR the last 2 years of his career. However, he was earning his paycheck by manning the pipes as the New York Rangers won their first Stanley Cup in more than 40 years in 1994. He also distinguished himself as a USA born goaltender selected to represent his country in the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.  The Rangers are trying to turn things around by investing in goalie prospects Jussi Markkanen and Dan Blackburn. They also picked up veteran goaltender Mike Dunham at last year's trading deadline. The writing was on the wall for Richter.

      The new ECHL this year has begun this season by including the west coast hockey teams in the Western Hockey League. This infusion of two leagues is reminiscent of the old WHA teams becoming NHL franchises. It also legitimizes a league that now has the capability to provide minor league development all over the United States. Check out the ECHL hockey league link to the left of the page for the teams. Included in the new super ECHL league is an expansion franchise Gwinnett Gladiators from near Atlanta, GA. I recommend that you visit their  urlLink official site .

      Two NHL franchises chose to honor their all time great goaltenders The Colorado Avalanche have decided to honor their franchise goaltender by raising #33 to the rafters of Denver's Pepsi Center. Patrick Roy called it a career earlier in the summer, but gave a passionate speech about what it was like to play hockey professionally.  Earlier in the season, new Hall of Famer Grant Fuhr had his #31 retired by the Edmonton Oilers. What was unique about his ceremony was that he was allowed to skate on the ice in full goalie gear donning the classic 1980's Oilers jersey.

      I am deeply troubled at the entry that I found on my buddy Tim Harvey's hockey blog. Here is an excerpt from it...    "[bleep]  you, Gary Bettman. I can't think of four words to better describe how I feel about the National Hockey League as I make my final entry into Rink Blog. On second thought, those four words should be: Thank you, Gary Bettman. Thank you for saving me a thousand dollars on tickets for poor to mediocre hockey.... Thank you for saving me a $150 on NHL Center Ice, which shows poor to mediocre hockey....Thank you for saving me $49.95 on The Hockey News, which covers poor to mediocre hockey.... After weeks of documenting your bullshit spat with the NHL Players' Association, I don't give a [bleep] anymore. Those are the four words I leave you with, Gary Bettman. NOBODY GIVES A  [bleep]!"    I think this recent tirade is with merit and speaks for a lot of hockey fans. It should focus on the frustrations of a sport that should have risen above the petty disputes that have plagued the NHL for quite some time. For a fan that should sit and watch the product and find it watered down so much that it gets this kind of reaction, then something must be done.  I think Mr. Harvey's rant on the conditions of professional hockey go a little bit to far. For him to sit there and throw his hands up in the air and give up on the greatest game in North America. My advice to Tim and others who feel like him is this: Don’t give up just yet! The actions of a few small-minded people controlling must not tarnish this great game. An analogy to this is where I disassociated the people from the institution. People make mistakes. We are lucky to have some institutions like true American freedom that stand alone as something closer to perfection. Bettman, Goodenow, and the like should be kicked out for what they are doing, but DON'T EVER STOP LOVING HOCKEY! Go see a peewee game, go to a minor league game, or if you can, just go out and skate around the rink. The game will survive this. Believe.

Nieuwendyk responded by saying "Uh-uh... new team; different attitude!" as a new member of the opposing Maple Leafs.  The Devils and Maple Leafs skated to a 2-2 tie as Toronto gave up a goal in the last seconds of the game.

      This just goes to show you that not always the squeaky wheel get the grease.  Last season, Latvian-born goaltender Arturs Irbe complained about his diminished role on the then defending Eastern Division champ Carolina Hurricanes. The team responded by demoting him to the AHL to give him playing time with the Lowell Lock Monsters.  Since the team picked up free agent Jamie Storr, Irbe became a man without a country. NHL Network and Fox Sports Net report that Irbe was again sent to the ECHL for the "legendary" Johnstown Chiefs.

      Just as the new hockey season is upon us, many teams start out fresh with a new outlook to the season. This season is going to be different for me and for my family as it will be the first hockey season without my maternal grandfather, Stephen M.  As I am consoling my family with the loss, my thoughts and memories of the good hockey fan my grandfather was over the years. We talked about the Penguins a lot. I remember him in his final years positioned on his favorite recliner rooting for the hometown franchise.  The classic hockey rivalry starts again in the NHL as the Pittsburgh Penguins play the Philadelphia Flyers. I could think of no other way to salute my grandfather by sitting back, cracking open an "Iiirrn" (Iron City Beer to you non-Pittsburghers), and watching the hockey game. [Flyers and Pens tied 2-2]     Stephen M. 1918-2003   "Hang in there, pup-pup. We still need you!"

      Here's a bit of news from  urlLink  Glen Colbourn of the Toronto Star     Coming tonight to a TV screen near you: Shania Twain telling hockey fans how she gets it. Get It? is the tagline of the NHL's new promotional ads, which feature Twain, Jim Belushi, Denis Leary, Kiefer Sutherland and Cuba Gooding Jr.  The 30-second spots try to show new fans how to watch hockey games and explain terms like "roughing" and "high-sticking." And they are intentionally cheeky. Twain, for example, describes "changing on the fly" while wearing a tight, midriff-baring, orange T-shirt. "Shifts are so exhausting they last less than a minute," she says. "Which leads to something you only want to hear in hockey ..." A clip of Marc Crawford then pops up with the Vancouver Canucks coach barking to his players: "Short and hard here, short and hard."    What a great idea. Shania is really beautiful!

Straka just wasn't producing much in a Penguins uniform and missing Mario Lemieux's help. He will try and turn it around personally on a struggling Kings team that has a lot of players on the Injured Reserve. If he could play with quick players Deadmarsh, Palffy, and/or Robitaille then the Kings could contend for a playoff spot in the West this year.

In a game with the Florida Panthers v. Buffalo Sabres, brother Mathieu scored a goal to help his team win.    "I was happy,"  Mathieu Biron said.  "I knew it was going to come sooner or later. I'm glad he didn't put me on the ice right after the goal. I didn't know what was going on. It's hard to explain."

      This  urlLink NHL Network  article reveals that the naming rights to the Oilers home rink will now be changed.  The Skyreach Center for Rexall Place.  I really don't like the new trend of naming rights to buildings. Now my NHL video games are all outdated. What if this Rexall company falls into disfavor with people like Enron did?

      The Buffalo Sabres will play the defending champion New Jersey Devils on the first neutral site game in Rochester, NY.  Fittingly, that is the home of the Sabre's minor league AHL franchise Rochester Americans.   Update:  The Sabres and Devils tied 2-2.

      I got in the mail a catalog for the new line of merchandise from the NHL. Just in time for the holidays. In it was the jersies, pucks, and other usual assorted stuff. Also, they included the section devoted to this years NHL all star game in St. Paul, Minnesota. They unveiled what the All-Star jersey's are going to look like. They are modeled after the "old style" knitted sweaters of yesteryear. They look nice, but expensive. Lastly, they want to appeal to the adressee, the hockey fan, as on the back page there is a picture of Karyia and Selane flanking a male model in a Flyers jersey. They personalized it with my name on the Flyers jersey!  Ack! They put my name on a Flyers jersey!

      During the Boston and San Jose game on ESPN 2, they flashed an interesting stat that since 1984 the Bruins have had 18 goaltenders protect the pipes. They threw out names like Andy Moog, Brian Rolston, Jim Carey. Hopefully, they can count on their current goaltender Felix Potvin to stop the revolving door trend.

      Congratulations to Mark Messier for surpassing Gordie Howe as second in the all time NHL point scoring race. His late empty net goal in the Dallas game was his 1,581th career point. He has at least 1,000 more points to go to surpass Wayne Gretsky.  Speaking of Gretsky...  Team Canada announced that he will be the GM of Canada's World Cup team in 2004. Canada is not only the defending Olympic chamions of 2002 but also the World Cup champs of 2003. He will be selecting the players for next years team.

      The one night that I had marked on my calendar was today. The Atlanta Thrashers were in Pittsburgh tonight and as a special promotion, the gave away Hall of Famer and Penguins Broadcasting voice Mike Lang talking bobbleheads. I was sure to go to see the game at the Mellon Arena. However, I found out later that my plans would change when my sister was already scheduled to have a Graduation ceremony at Penn State the same day. Oh well, there's always a next time.

      I am very proud of my Alma Mater and former employer PSU Women's Ice hockey team as I was looking at the College Hockey news digest via Yahoo News. I was genuinely surprised to see that the Lady Icers got a headline as they coppied a Daily Collegian atricle detailing the rescheduling of games planned against Massachusets. Keep in mind, these girls, though they work and do the very thing they love, they are just a club team to the University with little or no deep history or NCAA status. As a matter of fact both Penn State Men's and Women's teams are subjugated to the ACHA conference.

      While I was flipping around the TV dial, trying to learn the new cable channel switch, I came on The Learning Channel (TLC) and airing the show "While You Were Out". It is about a team of redecorating experts that collude with people challenged with redesigning a room in the house while another person is away.  During this particular eppisode, a loving wife decided that the downstairs bar/hockey room should be converted to the ultimate Hockey bar. I loved it. They had hockey sticks coming down the bannister, white walls with a Center Red stripe accross the middle, and a large digital TV.  It was even cooler that the family were Canadian and Maple Leafs fans. The TLC team all worked in replica Toronto jerseys.

Despite having one of the leagues lowest point totals (currently tied with the Pens), "sweaty teddy" has dropped the hammer on one of the leagues youngest coaches.

      It was announced today that "phenom" 18-year-old goaltender for the Pittsburgh Penguins, Marc-Andre Fleury, will be loaned to play for Team Canada in the World Junior Championships. Fleury was the goaltender for Canada last year which earned a Silver medal. Team USA is favored to win this years gold.

      From  urlLink NHL Network   A man known only as "Dale" (my theory is that it's Dale Hunter) was reported to have procured the winning bids to Wayne Gretsky's and Mark Messier's auctioned off jerseys of the Classic outdoor game played earlier in the month. The Gretsky jersey goes for $26.6 thousand ($34,827 CDN) and Messier $9.6 thousand ($12,569 CDN). when asked why he bought both jerseys, he was reported to have said  "it seemed only fair to keep them together".

      Well, today I just felt like I needed the chance to clear my head and find the Kirk Nevin Arena in Greensburg, PA. The afternoon sessions are the ones least ocupied. Today, I was the only one on the ice. I didn't even have any skate guards. For 2.75 hours, I had the pleasure of skating alone.  The Pens play in Philthydelphia (gee.. did I lose my journalistic integrity with that one?) tonight. The Penguins have managed 2 ties in 2 games thus far this season.

           The Toronto Maple Leafs have  urlLink on their Official website  the results of the Breast Cancer Awareness game. They raised $26,000 for the CBCF (Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation) Here are some of the excerpts from the article.    On-line auction items included the Leafs pink ribbon helmets with Tie Domi's helmet fetching the highest bid at $2,130. Helmets belonging to Gary Roberts, Mats Sundin and Alexander Mogilny's garnered $2,010, $1,400 and $1,400 respectively. HNIC (Hockey Night in Canada) personalities Don Cherry and Ron MacLean also participated in the auction by donating Cherry's pink jacket, which raised $5,010, and MacLean's pink tie that garnered $610.    It's amusing to see who's personal donation took in the most money. Domi, despite being a popular Toronto franchise player, is also widely known for goonish play. It's surprising that he would bring in more than superstars Nolan, Mogilny, or even their captain Sundin. Plus, Cherry v. MacLean's earning is amusing thinking back to their stance on the Iraq War recently. The disparity is of course due to a heavier bigger jacket to a tie, but 5 thousand to 6 hundred is far from being close. It shows you where the star power is on the HNIC program.    A "pink ribbon" theme was successfully incorporated into the Leafs  [November 8th]  game against the Edmonton Oilers with the distribution of 20,000 pink ribbons to game attendees by CBCF volunteers and Leafs wives and partners, while players from both teams wore exclusive pink ribbon game night helmets.    If you look at the website they show some of the players wives... and gosh some of them are HOT!! There is a lot to be said about Tellqvist's Swedish Blond wife! *wink*

      In the latest news of comings and goings in the NHL today,...  Dany Heatly returned to the ice tonight after 4 long months of rehab after suffering injuries sustained in a car accident. The accident also killed teammate Dan Snyder. Since that has happened, it has colored my opinion on Mr. Heatly. His reported careless actions behind the wheel does not signify a strength of character. The Thrashers tied the Blues 1-1.  Speaking of "strength of character"....  Eric Lindros leaves tonight's game against the Capitals for sustaining a yet unheralded 8th concussion. Skating with his head down along the bench boards, Lindros runs into a wall #54 [Jason Doig]. You'll remember that Lindros was traded to the Rangers after suffering a 7th concussion while playing for the Flyers.

      In what seems like a nightmarish two weeks for the Washington Capitals PR department, it's now gotten worse as the owner known to some fans as "Sweaty Teddy" or "Trillionaire Ted" Leonsis has reportedly attacked a fan tonight. Details of the attack are rumored to have happened like this... a fan named "Chris Hammer" held up a sign that read "First AOL and Now the Capitals - See the coincidence?" Leonsis wrestled the fan to the ground.  Pundits and people are shocked at Leonsis' actions as he was also known as being very fan frendly.  Expect a heavy fine coming the Capitals way.

        "The reality is I'm used to seeing more shots, more quality shots in Albany. This was an easy game for me. What'd I have, four shots in the third period? It's nice playing for these guys."   -- New Jersey goalie Scott Clemmensen who breezed to a shutout victory in his first NHL game Tuesday night in Pittsburgh.   Oh, quit gloating already, Scott! You are lucky to even be playing with Brodeur hurt. Plus, the Pens played down to your AHL level with the minor leaguers that they put on the ice every night.

      Jaromir Jagr finally got his wish as he was traded to a major market franchise (just about the only franchise that could afford his 10 million a year salary). The New York Rangers, fearing missing the playoffs again this year hope that they can spark a path to the post season. Jagr could be the first in a long line of players that leave the Capitals as reported by TSN's Sportscenter. Anson Carter now finds himself on the Capitals.   The Rangers have also added journyman defenceman Jamie Pushor from the Columbus Blue Jackets. This is Pushor's 3rd team this season after spending time with the Maple Leafs and Blue Jackets this year. He also was a stopgap in the defence as a member of the Penguins last season.  In other moves around the leage, Charlie Stephens of the Avalanche goes to Ottawa for veteran forward and career AHLer Dennis Bonvie.

      From  urlLink  the AHL official site    With native son Roger Clemens among them, the largest crowd in the AHL this season  13,342 fans  were on hand Friday night to watch the Houston Aeros battle the rival San Antonio Rampage at the Toyota Center in Houston.  It was the largest crowd at an Aeros home game since the team joined the AHL in 2001.     I thought I'd just squeeze a little AHL news and notes in to the fray to try and uphold a more well diverse reporting on this Hockey Blog. Roger Clemmens did a good thing by getting out and meeting the community. He's associating his career himself to the city he calls home!

      Boston Bruins forward Cam Neely had his number retired tonight. Cam's decade long career was cut short after injury because of the physical style that he used on the ice. He led the team with 55 career goals.  Perhaps his best known achievement is the establishment of the Neely House Foundation. It's mission is to provide housing for families that suffer with cancer disease.      urlLink  Bob Snow  summed it up best in his NHL.com article.   Last night, Bruin Nation recognized a unique player.

      What an amazing turn around it has been for Phoenix Coyotes goaltender, Brian Boucher. Tonight, he added his name to the legacy of dominant Western Conference goaltenders as his streak of shut-out hockey ended against the Thrashers.  Boucher has already made history by setting a NHL record of 5 concecutive shut out games. It totals his time between the pipes 322 minutes and 1 second without a goal being scored.  The Coyotes fans hope that this could resurect the franchise who were struggling to win at home all season long. Boucher, a castoff from Philadelphia, was playing himself into oblivion while watching goaltender Sean Burke get most of the workload this season.

      In an all too familiar senario, Pittsburgh fans are dissapointed at the decision that Mario Lemieux has decided to call it quits for the year. Many fans have speculated that Mario was only interested in himself and money. However, the truth is that Mario Lemieux, now 38, has given his selfless time, money and energy to save the Penguins franchise not only once but 3 times.  Blaming a bad hip, Mario plans to have surgery to repair the tendonitis in his left hip. Hope for a better year came with the admission from Mario,  " It's disappointing that I won't have a chance to return to the ice this season, but I look forward to coming back next year.

       A failed clearing pass by Canada's goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury ended up in his own net with 5:12 left and gave the United States a 4-3 victory in the world junior hockey championship game Monday. Zach Parise, left, of North Dakota was chosen MVP of the tournament   Another legendary moment goes down in history fueling the rivalry between the United States and Team Canada. The talk of the town is that Marc-Andre Fleury will be undergoing crutiny as to his confidence level and how he would perform in the NHL post-clearing pass mistake. Some die-hard Canadian fans are taking the loss pretty hard as a big dissapointment. The World Juniors are supposed to be a exhibition of young talent for the future, but what does that say for hockey in North America to compete at a dominant level? Team Canada may have fallen a few pegs on the food chain.

It's good stuff!    Whew. I'm not a big fan of seeing women go into most men's-only sports or men going into women's-only sports (yay for the differences between men and women), but I used to play ice hockey... And I played because I love the sport - I loved the speed and cold air and the strategy involved in moving the puck across the ice... I played because it was fun.

The Pens now have a little time off to get the losing out of their system as they go to San Jose and play the Pacific leading Sharks.

He's the latest hired gun in a league that obviously cycles the stars arond during playoff times. "Loaners" as we call them. To keep up with the Maple Leafs, the Senators must deal for some players. The Sens also acquired Rob Ray from retirement.

John Steigerwald on the radio suggested that the fans come out to see the Mon. night game against the Maple Leafs because they would be the more exciting team.  Of course, he was right. The Pens lost the game 8-4.

      Depending on how you look at it, it could either be the first nail in the coffin for Bob Goodenow or the NHL President Gary Bettman's.  Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt says in an independant audit that the NHL  "$273 million on revenues of $1.996 billion"   Yikes! That's a lot of money! I think it's a serious bargaining chip in the hands of the NHL owners who want change in the form of a salary cap and revenue sharing.  The story continues on  urlLink  NHL.com  as...   The 24 page study (plus 11 exhibits) reveals that 19 of the League's 30 teams had operating losses in 2002-2003 averaging $18 million and that only 11 teams were profitable averaging $6.4 million in profits.

      Well, the NHL half way point has come and gone. The 2004 NHL All Star Game is but a memory. Joe Sakic walked away from the game as MVP with his hat trick, but the East Conference came out on top. I think last years uniforms were a lot better. The old fashioned knitted sweaters just didn't translate well to TV. I don't see a lot of people buying them. What was wrong with last years Blue and White combo.  (or they could have gone to a blue/red combination if they want to promote dark colored jerseys more). The next years all star game is going to be in Atlanta...  if  there is a next year!

      On this date in 1976...  Darryl Sittler sets the NHL standard for most points in one game (10) with six goals, four assists, versus Boston. The Leafs defeat the Bruins 11-4.   Well, add this to your trivia collection! I found it on the Maple Leafs page.

      Well,.. the long wait is over.. I can now tell you what I thought of the movie, "Miracle"!  First of all, let me get some of the negatives out of the way. I suspected that since Disney produced it, they must have some sort of slant. Nevertheless, they included a voiceover of President Carter claiming in a old speech "our country's goals aren't always the best." Yea, like the recent Iraq war. Subtle slam on America. But I wasn't fooled.  Again, a banner that read, "Hey Russia, get the puck out of Afganistan" was shown in the movie. I believe that history was correct in this instance Russia did in fact invade Afganistan, but who's in Afganistan right now fighting the Taliban and Al Queida? Subtle Disney-Liberal dis to the Red, White, and Blue.  With that asside, Kurt Russell playing the late coach Herb Brooks deserves an Oscar nomination.  He really showed the driven nature of "Herbie" and fought to keep a bunch of college amateurs playing as a team. My favorite scene is when he made the entire team run wind sprints after a game until they realized that they represented a cause larger than themselves.  Go see the film or go read my review at  urlLink  The College Press  in greater detail.

      I guess they outlawed freedom of speech in Canada. Even after my experience in Toronto, I'm convinced that some sort or aparteid is going on there.  I read on TSN's NHL Network page that co-host of CBC's Hockey Night in Canada, Don Cherry, is undergoing investigations after comments he made on his editorial segment called "Coaches Corner". Coach Don Cherry said that the only hockey players who wear visors are europeans and "the french". Well, that pissed off a lot of liberals in the country. (Despite the statistics that back up Cherry) A statement like this in Canada qualifies as a "hate crime". The liberals have been trying for years to get Cherry off the show, and really dislike him for backing the U.S. during the Iraq war.   Well, besides Portland, OR, and Winnepeg, Manitoba, the latest news out of Ontario is that a law firm in Hamilton is looking into acquiring an NHL team and move them to their city. Already an unidentified NHL team was looking to relocate to Winnepeg. It's another sign that all things are cyclical, Canadian teams were once being lost to U.S. and now teams are trecking north of the border.

      Mark Messier took a final lap around MSG tonight. It is the final game of the year for the rebuilding Rangers. He took a long drawn out, but well-deserved bow to all the fans. I could tell that he was trying not to get emotional during the moment.  This by far is not the official signing off. He hasn't called it "quits" just yet. Messier said good-bye to the fans today in a really classy way. He even got to score one final goal.

       Houston, we have a problem!   I think the  urlLink Houston Aeros  of the  urlLink AHL  didn't get the memo! Aparently, they missed on the idea that hockey is trying to get away from the goonism and fighting. But if you go to their website, you'll see the press release featured on it.  Here's a quick summary of where Houston who has a great idea of a cross promotion, but the timing of it just stinks! Judge for yourselves.   The Houston Aeros and WWE are tagteaming to bring a WWE Superstar to the Thursday, April 1 game against the Cincinnati Mighty Ducks. The Superstar will be announced next week.  In addition, by calling the Aeros office, fans can purchase an Aeros corner seat for the April 1 game, plus a WWE ticket for the Monday, April 5 appearance at Toyota Center, for just $30.

      When in times of need, some of us forget to accentuate the positives in life. We could fret over all the negative press coverage that the "Bertuzzi incident" caused or I could tell you about what the mainstream media did not.  The  urlLink Jennifer Ferraro Foundation  was set up to give help and hope to people suffering with cancer disease. Ms. Ferraro was the sister to Chris and Peter current players of the Washington Capitals franchise. Last Saturday night (4/13/03), the Springfield Falcons and Portland Pirates played a game where the Falcons wore specially designed "Team Jennifer" jerseys and auctioned them off to the public for charity.  Do yourselves a favor and go visit the website and donate what you can to worthy causes to fight cancer and other diseases. I've added a special section to collect website links for the charity efforts.

      I have to way in on more of the media coverage to the Bertuzzi-Moore incident. I laughed my ass off at the post that  urlLink Joe Taska  has up recently at his Hockey commentary blog. I suppose I should credit the original source as  urlLink Sally Jenkins from the Washington Post     Real hockey people wear "Free Bert" T-shirts, like those fans in Vancouver who rallied in support of Bertuzzi over the weekend, led by rally organizer Sean Carl. According to Carl, who is a real hockey guy, Bertuzzi is being persecuted and Moore's injuries have been exaggerated by the Colorado Avalanche.    Histerical!  I do think that Bertuzzi does deserve a little support in all of this. He's still a human being and shouldn't be villified to the point that we'll be running commericals on the TV comparing Bertuzzi to Hussein.

      Okay, so I'm definitely enjoying watching the Pittsburgh Penguins! They have a stretch run of rivalry games in the schedule. So far, they've played up to their competition. Bob Errey (the Pens commentator) has mentioned that they played that way against "non-playoff teams"  This afternoon they had the dreaded Philladelphia Flyers. They gave a tough attempt, but could only keep the tie. 3-3. Tuesday, the Pens play the "new look" (translation = salary-dumped) Capitals at the Mellon Arena. Here's the rest of the Pens "rivalry stretch" schedule.    March 7   @ Rangers March 9    Stars March 11 @ Maple Leafs March 14  Flyers March 16  Capitals March 17 @ Devils March 19  Hurricanes March 21  Rangers March 23 @ Rangers

      With the help from  urlLink Vertical Alliance 's PR digest newsletter, The Florida Panthers have released this public relations ploy to get more people out to the game. Here is an excerpt from that clever email.    Knowing that many Canadians migrate to Florida during the winter months, the Florida Panthers created a "Canadian Night" promotion targeted specifically to Canadian citizens. Canadian fans were able to purchase tickets in Canadian dollars, which gave them a significant discount as the Canadian dollar is currently worth about 24 cents less than the American bill... The Panthers held the first "Canadian Night" promotion at a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The event was only promoted through the Canadian press. The promotion was a success for the Panthers, as a sellout crowd of 19,000+ attended the game... (National Sports Forum's "Selling It", 3/3)

        PM to hockey: 'clean up your act'    In what I thought would be a true return of some interest to covering hockey, "we fans" now see the public relations disaster spreading in the media. Their bias against the NHL is only fueled by the latest controversial incident involving Todd Bertuzzi #44 of the Vancouver Cannucks and Steve More #36 of the Colorado Avalanche. Apparently, there was some bad blood between 'Couver and Moore who was alleged to have taken a hit on Naslund some time ago. Bertuzzi saw fit to stalk him on the ice and sucker punch him from behind. Moore hit the ice with such force it broke his neck and now puts his career in jepardy.   " I don't think it's given Canada a black eye, but I certainly don't think it's helped hockey, '' said Liberal PM Paul Martin.   Indeed, Mr. Martin. This is not good for the casual fan who won't put up with said antics. ESPN, CNN, CNN-HN, Fox Sports are all talking about it, but holding a negative referendum on the violence. The anti-hockey crowd is just licking their chops with the negative spin.  If it can't get any worse. Look what I found on the AP wire...  AMERICA'S BAD GIRL IN ACTION FRIDAY AS PART OF "GUARANTEED FIGHT NIGHT" ...  reads the headline in the Indianapolis Ice on their   urlLink official web site  as disgraced and maligned Figure Skater Tonya Harding has signed on to play in a CHL game this coming Friday.  If this isn't a publicity stunt, I don't know what is. Hockey is officially out of control!

      With the trading deadline over now today at 3 PM EST, there were indeed some shocking trades and developments in the National Hockey League.  Veteran Center and all around classy guy, Ron Francis, was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a 4th round draft pick. In what is sure to be seen as a playoff rental, Francis was expected to finish his career with the organization that he is mostly associated with in Hartford/Carolina. He also spent a long time earning respect as a role player on the Pittsburgh Penguins teams during the 90's winning a cup with them in '92.  The Vancouver Cannucks warned everybody that their moves to improve their roster would be calm and logical. They went out to several sources like the Rangers and got Rucinsky (for R.J. Umburger who grew up in Pittsburgh and many Pens fans wanted R.J. to come home) and Geoff Sanderson from Columbus.

      Has this ever happened to you???  I was playing NHL 2004 for Playstation 2 simulating a game using the up to the minute rosters of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Dallas Stars. In the first period, I noticed that former Leaf, Shayne Corson, did not have the correct jersey number on him when I started the game. He did haunt his former teammates with a goal in the 1st period. Dissapointed that my new favorite team in the Leafs were losing 2-1 at the first intermission, I turned off the game in favor of updating a few things on the Dallas roster.  When I went back and re-simulated (meaning I played the game, as I often do, by having the computer control both teams) the Toronto v. Dallas exhibition, I noticed that it picked up right where I had left it. The first period goals were exactly the same. Morrow and Corson both scored in the same manner exactly.  Is this how things work out in real life? I don't know!

Flyers fans)    The Rogers Sportsnet broadcasters seemed completely befuddled by the euphoric reaction of the Flyer fans during the course of the fisticuffs. The reason why is anybody's guess, as Philadelphia is widely known for its appreciation of bloodshed.

      Seeing the need for a reputation revamp, Dallas Stars Shayne Corson lashes out at his former teammates, organization, fans and Toronto media by offering his reasons for quitting on his team during last year's playoffs. You can read it here, or you can go to TSN's NHL Network web page for the story.   "Hey, if I screw up on the ice, criticize me. I'm man enough. I'll take the heat. It's part of the job. But some of that stuff . . . I just wasn't healthy enough to make any sort of contribution to the team. People can believe what they want, but that's the truth.''  He blames his behaviour last year on panic-anxiety attacks, for which he's sought out additional professional help. He's also changed medicine and the results have been remarkable.    Spin it any way you like, I hope you got help for your issues, but you still  QUIT !!!

      With special thanks to my new friend  urlLink  Joe Tasca , I read a very amusing story on his site as reported to him through pressconnects.com. It seems as if Bing-hampton Senators goaltender Ray Emery has had a very shaky life in the AHL. It seems as if the Wilkes-Bare Scranton Penguins are his favorite team to play against. In Wednesdays game, Emery was given a match penalty a 5 minute major for striking WBS player with his blocking pad. It was the final factor to the game as the Pens won 7-3 off two power play goals. Tasca has featured on his site has the rap sheet on the volitaile netminder.  In December of 2003, Emery skated the length of the ice and pummeled Wilkes-Barre goaltender Andy Chiodo (now the starting goaltender in Pittsburgh) during an all out brawl.

Among North American players born outside of Quebec, only 20 per cent wear face shields to guard against injury.    Well!

      I've been reading up on hockey going on in the rest of the continent and I'm interested in what is going to go on with the American Hockey League if or when the NHL goes on strike. It looks to be that most of the NHL owners are going to keep a lot of their young talent to the minors. That way, they can be exempt and not sitting on their hands during the strike. Good idea!   While the NHL heads toward what could be a lengthy work stoppage, the AHL is flourishing. Should there be a lockout or strike in the fall, its top development circuit might benefit in popularity, exposure, even in significance. But the last thing the AHL wants to see is a hockey Armageddon.   They also want to tweak with the game to make it match more of the NHL rules. Some of the NHL GMs made a few suggestions on   urlLink this article     A system that will give three points for a regulation victory, two for an overtime victory, and one for an overtime loss.  A game-deciding shootout. A shootout winner will get two points, while the losing team gets one. Tie games would be eliminated.  Expanding the width of the blue and red lines.

      Well... the NHL Trade Deadline is coming up on March 9th and people are talking about the teams that may get geared up for this upcomming post season dance.  According to my friends at the  urlLink NHL Network , trusted source - Bob McKenzie, says that Atlanta Thrashers goalie Byron Dafoe is rumored to be traded to the Maple Leafs.  This would be an incredibly stupid move for the "Leaves" since they have proven already stocked in the goaltender dept. despite "Unstable Eddie" future with a back sprain. Of course, the well-traveled veteran Dafoe is under some questionable scrutiny. He recently got hurt and embarrassed for slipping on the ice outside his hotel not too long ago. As a hockey player, you'd think he'd be able to traverse the ice! Dafoe even got attention from Paul Harvey's commentary by focusing on his ironic mishap.

      While surfing around and listening to music online related to hockey, I found this one song sung by Canadian rockers "The Tragically Hip". Listening closely, I heard the singer mention something about "the last goal he ever scored won the leafs the cup."  I'd say that song was about hockey. However, I really just enjoyed the music without knowing what exactly the song meant. I had to watch tonight's game of Philly v. Toronto on ESPN as explained by Steve Levy to get the full story.  The "fifty mission cap" song is about the mysterious cycle of how the Leafs won the Cup in the early 50's. The guy who scored the winning goal unfortunately dissapeared that summer after taking a plane to go fishing. The Leafs didn't win the Stanley Cup championship for over 10 years. They finally found his remains and that same year, the Leafs won the cup in 1962.  Believe it or not, read for yourselves at a web page honoring one of the Leafs players to have his jersey number actually retired.  urlLink Barilko WebPage  Today, Darcy Tucker of the Toronto Maple Leafs hope that Brilko's Ghost or Legend will work one more time. He hopes the media will pick up the story and fans re-discover Brilko in hopes that Toronto wins the Stanley Cup again this season.

      Folowing up on the controversial issues surrrounding the CBC and their segment "Coaches Corner" I've compared two Toronto newspapers  urlLink Toronto Star  and the  urlLink Toronto Sun  talking about what to do about the controversial host, Don Cherry.  It seems as if Cherry will no longer be a part of the traditional Hockey Night in Canada on the government owned CBC.  However, if their government were at all interested in listening to their citizens and believed in free speech, they'd cite this online poll from Slam! Sports:   After 12,000 votes on  Slam! Sports Webpage  60% said keep him.   Globe and Mail of Toronto (the guys that do the TSN stuff) offers a poll of their own:     If Don Cherry leaves the CBC, will you miss him? No    12752 votes   (51 %) Yes   12348 votes   (49 %)

      Yes.. you saw correctly!  Union President Bob Goodenow and NHL Commissioner Garry Bettman sitting together in Torono's Air Canada Centre to watch the playoff game Maple Leafs v. Flyers. They were initially there to re-establish talks to extend the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  ESPN's cameras picked it up and I'm guessing that CBC and TSN picked it up as well.  The Flyers got their asses beat tonight against the Leafs. I think the few days off from the series, plus getting out of that shit hole called Wachovia Center helped big time. The "Leafs Nation" were all there in Full force today waving their banners, towels, and stuff. Melrose on NHL 2night said that the Leafs always play with heart and desire. I believe him now for sure!

      Since NHL has currently dropped the puck on growng the sport, the Board of Commish's have proposed drastic measures to scale back the NHL season.   urlLink NHL Network and TSN  report that the NHL will shorten their season to 72 games. The worst of it is that they want to emulate Major League Baseball so much to restrict the Eastern and Western teams from playing each other. The theory is that the regional rival games bring in more fans. But NHL Network reports that the Western Canadian teams like it when the Leafs come to town.

       New Type of Arena?  The  urlLink Pittsburgh Tribune Review  may break the story that a new type of arena may be built in Pittsburgh. A group of Wall Street investors would like to build a $150 million arena for the Penguins and the city to use. Only this would be the first underground arena in the world!  I'll be watching the developments of this story as it continues to unfold.

      Well.. the first round was really exciting.. time now for my predictions for round two! I got most of them right! Montreal really surprised me.   Western Conference   Detroit v. Calgary    The age is starting to catch up with Detroit. But their greatest weakness can be their greatest strength. Detroit's veteran leadership got them through the first round. Stevy Y, Hull, and Lang have been solid. Calgary is the best story of the year. Iginla is the star that he should be and it's been a while since Calgary has had anything to root for. Matter of fact, The last time the Flames and Wings met in the playoffs, the Flames were in the old Omni in Atlanta.  Prediction: Wings in 6    San Jose v. Colorado  What a difference a coach and a year make! San Jose has been in the playoffs before, but never this high. The "shark tank" will be rocking tonight! Selane and Granato will treat it like a homecomming as they both have played for the Sharks. The Avs think that 4th place is a fluke and hopes to make it to the Conference finals. The have the firepower, but will the Sharks no-name defense eat them alive?  Prediction: Sharks in 5    Eastern Conference   Tampa Bay v. Montreal  Montreal faked their way into the second round. The controversial Ribiero move cost a lot of luster from the "storied" Montreal legacy. Tampa Bay is just happy to be there! However, in a reversal of fortunes, Tampa is the king of the eastern hill. Martin St. Louis for Tampa is getting a lot of pundits to dub him Hart Trophy and Lady Bing at the end of the year.  Prediction: Lightning in 6   Philidelphia v. Toronto  It's deja vu all over again! These two teams met last year with the Flyers on top. "The Flyers are a team that you don't have to work hard for to hate," said Toronto coach Pat Quinn. You can't ask for any better bulletin board material. Flyers are banking on their goalies and the "blackhawk line" to pull them through. Roenick, Amonte, and Zhamnov were all teammates in the windy city.  Prediction: Leafs in 6  - hopefully.

       Stanley Cup Races turning ugly...  With more drama than a Presidential race.. the Stanley Cup Tournament Playoffs have had more mud slinging than than a girl 'wrastlin' at the local bar. *wink*  Ottawa's Team 1200 caught some serious heat when some of their broadcasters lampooned and inferred that Toronto's enforcer Tie Domi beats his wife. Domi's response is that he's thinking of taking legal action.  Toronto's Coach countered by sullying the image of the Ottawa Senators saying "The Senators misled the fans by giving off a vibe that they're all good guys when they're just as dirty".  In the Bruins v. Canadiens series... things have gotten so ugly that it threatens the very fabric of the NHL's credibility. Mike Ribiero layed down on the ice and got the refs to stop action. Later, Ribiero was seen on the bench laughing. The Bruins questioned Ribiero's health and said that he may have just been faking. Then during the Bruins v. Canadians on Tuesdays game, Alexei Kovalev got slashed on the hand, ran into his own player and Boston scored the game winning OT goal. Experts theorised that Kovalev could not be that hurt through the glove.  The best part was that big Barry Melrose definitely looked pissed that the Canadians have stooped this low on ESPN's NHL2night.

      The playoffs begin today, so.. just like last year, here's my interpretation and predictions of the first round.   Western Conference    Detroit v. Nashville  This is the most watched playoff series as Detroit hopes to not repeat last years sweep by the Ducks. Nashville tried to garuntee a playoff run last year to their season ticket holders, but they made it this year. Nashville earned their spot down to the last day of the season. Manny Legace is expected to start in goal.  Prediction: Wings in 5    San Jose v. St. Louis  The quietest team going into the playoffs and the team that gets the least amount of respect in Division winning San Jose is looking to advance. St. Louis dumped their coach and was riddled with injuries for the past two years. I don't know how they got into the playoffs again. Osgood is huge in the playoffs. That should help the Blues.  Prediction: Sharks in 5    Vancouver v. Calgary  Vancouver minus Bertuzzi is interesting to watch. Fresh faced Calgary is a blue collar team looking to build upon their rebuilding. Watch for the Canucks to pay dividends in their deals at the deadline.  Prediction: Canucks in 7    Colorado. v. Dallas  In the most evenly matched series of the Western playoffs, rivals collide! Aebisher is the key to Colorado because their big gun Paul Karyia may be done for the year due to an injury. He took a pay cut believing the 'Lanche to be his best shot at winning the Cup. Dallas isn't the team they used to be.  Prediction: Avalanche in 5    Eastern Conference    Tampa Bay v. NY Islanders  In the East, the least respected is Tampa Bay ('cuz who thought of Hockey in Florida?). They were in the running for the Presidents Trophy. The Isles have gone far with Yashin and hopes their investment in #1 pick Rick DiPietro will get them to the promised land.  Prediction: Tampa in 4    Boston v. Montreal  Original 6 rivals collide! No two teams have met in the post season than these two teams! Boston rides the back of Andy Raycroft, a Calder Trophy nominee. Montreal is just happy to be there where losing is no option. Prediction: Bruins in 5    Philidelphia v. New Jersey  Atlantic Division and local rivals go at it where the defending champs have slipped from grace. The Devils are missing Stevens, but have the equalizer in Brodeur. Philly lost veteran Dejardins after hurting his hand playing catch with his son. Philly is stocked for a deep playoff run. Sorry, Jersey no repeat this year Prediction: Flyers in 7    Toronto v. Ottawa  In the best evenly matched teams in the East, the "Battle of Ontario" look to take repeated shots at each other in what is turning out to be a great rivalry. Toronto was active at the trading deadline to match up with thier rivals. Ottawa also hired ex-Cap Peter Bondra. Sorry Sens loyalists, Go Leafs Go!  Prediction: Maple Leafs in 7

      The Penquins got screwed!! Big Time!!  The Washington Capitals walked away from the Draft lottery getting the first overall pick, despite the Pens reluctantly getting last place in the NHL. Here's how the top five are set to pick in June 2004  1. Capitals 2. Penguins 3. Blackhawks 4. Blue Jackets 5. Coyotes

      Tonight, the Thrashers organization paid tribute to #37. Dan Snyder was tragically killed in a car accident. " He'll have to live with that the rest of his life, " said Pens Hall of Fame announcer Mike Lange during the game about the perp responsible, Danny Heatly.   Also, Kovalchuk was going for a 40 goal season. You could tell how hard he was trying when all of his teammates were just serving it up to him every chance they got. Ilya had 8 or 9 shots all by himself in the first period. He was so visibly frustrated at how Pens goalie J.S. Aubin covered him well by stopping every chance.  However, Kovalchuk would not be denied! He got a goal with less than 30 seconds remaining in the game to make it an even 40 goals during the regular season. Hollywood can't come up with such natural drama!  He gets one more chance to tack on more goals during the Thrashers last game of the year against their division rival Tampa Bay.

      I'm wishing that this is a April Fool's Joke, but sadly it seems legit! Aparently, they didn't get the memo that hockey is trying to move away from all the negative stereotype that fighting and goonism has brought to the game.  Read on...   ATHENS, Ohio -- If you ever have uttered the words, "I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out," you are exactly the type of person who is encouraging people like Darryl Wolski. Wolski is the man behind an upcoming Pay-Per-View event called "Hockey Gladiators," an affair that takes former pro and semi-pro hockey players known more for fistcuffs than puck control and lets them beat the heck out of each other. Fans get enjoyment, and the players get a few bruises and a chance at a $100,000 prize. "The idea about Hockey Gladiators came about in a lounge after a senior hockey game five years ago," Wolski said in an e-mail interview. "Hockey highlights were on the screen and a fight was shown. The entire place went crazy."  urlLink

      In American Hockey League News, the Wilkes-Bare Scranton Penguins have advanced to the Calder Cup Finals by beating the Hartford Wolf Pack (NY Rangers organization) in OT. They will move on to play the Western Conference Champs in the Milwaukee Admirals (Predators organization) in a best of 7 series. This is the second trip to the Calder Cup Finals for the short franchise life of the WBS Penguins. The Penguins made the Finals in 2001, but lost to the now defunct Saint John Flames. Milwaukee this year is one of the teams the AHL admitted when the International Hockey League folded.

Some of the new features to the new site layout would be an expanded profile section - so you can learn about where I'm from and what my interests are, a Comments section so you can give me feedback to my coverage. Let me know if I'm fair, even coverage, or way off the mark!  Please come back later as I will get all of the blog, news, league, and other links up soon. Some of the links will be discontinued, some of the links will be moved around, and some of the links I've endorsed over these past 2 years will no longer appear on  Confessions of a Hockey Fanatic  Weblog due to inactivity or contain content that just does not fit in with the Hockey format.  Thank you all for reading up on my  Confessions of a Hockey Fanatic  Weblog and I'll see you when we have a Stanley Cup winner!

      It takes a well-trained journalist to spot a fake. Pittsburgh Sports Writer Bob Smizik got himself in hot water today with a column article that he wrote for my hometown Pittsburgh Post Gazette. You can read it if you want at this link  urlLink Pittsburgh Post Gazette & Smizik . I must admit that I to was sucked in initially to Smizik's opinion, but giving it a little bit more thought, it's clear that all he wants to do is attract attention to himself driving up his readership.  (aparently it worked)  In the article, Bob Smizik attempts to criticize the way the playoff rosters are set up for the American Hockey League. He claims that had the Flyers not gone deep into the NHL playoffs, then they too could have loaned their NHL players to the Phantoms and the Baby Pens of Scranton could not have advanced as easily as they did. The truth of the matter is, Bob, if you don't like the way the final rosters are set up for the playoffs and how they are played simultaneously to the NHL playoffs, DON'T tear down what this Penguins organization has worked so hard for. Don't point the finger at them. They play by the AHL rules.

      Time for the Stanley Cup Finals - winning now means you are riding high as champions of the NHL and able to party with Lord Stanley's Cup all summer long!   Stanley Cup Finals   Tampa Bay v. Calgary  Calgary won the Stanley Cup back in 1989 with quite a number of future Hall of Famers. (Lanny McDonald, Mike Vernon, Al McInnis to name a few.) The Flames team captain Tampa Bay is shaped up to look just like the Montreal of the late 80's (that's back when their team was really good). All of the Lightning stars are from Quebec providence (Richards, St. Louis, and Lecavalier) and "The 'Boulin Wall" Nikoali Khabibulin is playing just as strong if not stronger than what Patrick Roy did in his prime. I am very upset at how the mainstream media has been covering this Stanley Cup Finals matchup. ESPN (the Disney-owned sports broadcasting company) should be the ones to take the lead and build the news hype and cover the Finals the way they should. Instead, I hear negativity of only how the ratings are down and the Pundits would most likey want to see the league just die off! To the American media credit, they have featured Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla. Not so fast!! They have, however, taken a considerable amount of coverage time to Iginla's ethnic background. Since when is a players' ethnicity a story? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SKIN COLOR HE IS! Tampa Bay is just happy to be here. In their decade long NHL run, they've reached the pinacle and are Bolt-ing to the finish line. Tampa has 4 lines that can score and as I mentioned before a goalie who has a record worth of shut outs in these playoffs. They were the #1 team in the Eastern Conference and represenative of the "southleast division".  Prediction: Flames in 7

      Do you feel that sometimes decisions in sports are the results of meetings between greedy owners and incompetent union leaders?  Please, I recommend that you all go to  urlLink National Hockey League Fans Association  (NHLFA) website and sign up to become a member.  The NHLFA's mission statement is to become the first Professional Sport that recognizes the fans for their tireless dedication and offers input on mediation to some NHL issues.  If this group was around earlier, could they have possibly been able to prevent Hartford from moving to Carolina? Could the NHLFA be the voice of reason when negotiating the Collective Bargaining Agreement?

      Congratulations to Tampa Bay Lightning and all their fans for making this year the best in their decade in the NHL.  "Safe is Death" is Head Coach John Tortorella's motto.  Tonight they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 7 by the score of two to one.  Fredrik Modin (#33), Lightning player for 5 seasons, scored the game winning goal in the 2nd period. The happiest player on the Lightning roster is team captain and noted "old" veteran Dave Andreychuk. This is his 22nd NHL season and he has never won the Cup.  Tampa meets up with the waiting Calgary Flames in the Stanley Cup Finals on Tuesday.

      The defending champion team Canada have announced their roster for the World Cup team to be played later this summer. The team was selected by "the great one" Wayne Gretzky and Kevin Lowe as a comitee of Executive Directors.  Two names are obviously on it... Gretsky's current employee Shane Doan (who is currently a Phoenix Coyote) and Mario Lemieux was penciled in as a posibility.  From  urlLink WHC2004.com     Canada's roster includes 14 players that won a gold medal at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, six (6) players that played for Team Canada at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, six (6) players that won a gold medal at the 2004 Men's World Hockey Championship in Prague last week, and seven (7) players that won World Championship gold in 2003 in Finland. In total, Canada's roster accounts for 686 international games played in either the World Juniors, the Olympics, the World Championship or the Canada Cup/ World Cup of Hockey.  The WCH 2004 rules state that teams will dress 18 skaters and two goalies for each game. The World Cup of Hockey 2004 runs from August 30 - September 14, 2004.

      With thanks to Reuters news service, it must be bittersweet news to all hockey fans living in Toronto, Canada today.    TORONTO-  Billionaire Eugene Melnyk, founder and chief executive of Biovail Corp., Canada's largest publicly traded drug company, said on Friday he wants to stop a rival bidder for Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens .   The aforementioned rival bidder was  urlLink Loblaws , Canada's biggest retail grocer. They wanted to create a large grocery store with an indoor parking garage. Mr. Melnyk wants to rescue Maple Leaf Gardens and turn the legendary building into a hockey shrine and feature junior teams.  Ottawa gets the last laugh though... Mr. Melnyk was the billionaire who rescued the Ottawa Senators from bankrupsy - Toronto Maple Leafs NHL and hated Providencial rivals.

      With thanks to  urlLink TMLFans.ca , they have passed on the information that  urlLink TSN  reports that legendary NHL goalie and current Maple Leafs president Ken Dryden will represent Toronto and the Liberal Party in the Canadian Parliment.  I guess Canadians have caught on to the trend of putting famous people into politics. Jesse Ventura, Steve Largent, and Arnold Schwarzenegger are just a few of the American names who have or had held public office.  I guess it is all about popularity and name recognition in politics.  On a related Maple Leafs note, the team's official site said yesterday  in bold print  that MOJO radio have renewed their contract to air Leafs games for another 7 seasons. However, they had a picture of Brian Leetch next to the write up with the caption "Brian Leetch will be back next year for the Leafs". Based on what? Leetch has nothing to do with the MOJO story. At first glance I was even misled to believe that Leetch signed for 7 more seasons.  Just an example of poor journalism on their part.

      For you hockey novices, I hope you don't get confused with some of the names and division lineups.  Wachovia is a fianical bank and securities firm. They own Eastern Pennsylvania. They bought up all the First Union naming rights not too long ago  If you see "Baby Pens defeat the Phantoms at Wachovia Arena" would you know which team was home and away?  The Flyers play in Wachovia Center The Phantoms play in the Wachovia Spectrum The AHL Penguins play in the Wachovia Arena at Casey Plaza.  Confused yet?    So, I think I've made my distain for Philadelphia teams and their fans quite clear... but is it wrong if I'm seen in a Philadelphia Phantoms AHL Third Jersey?  I was elated that my Baby Pens have taken it too the Flyers minor league team in what I understand is a very important rivalry. I interviewed Glen Patrick a couple years back on the radio and he addressed the rivalry situation.  Check out the  urlLink Calder Cup Official Site   urlLink Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins   urlLink Philadelphia Phantoms  Websites to keep up on what's going on in the minors.  In other news, the Rochester Americans have swept their series and await Chicago vs. Milwalkee.

      I got this email from "the Hockey Mistress" not too long ago. She wanted me to check out her website dedicated to Hockey Fiction... but with a twist. It's Hockey Erotic fiction.  If you're bored and need a hockey fix of a diferent kind, I'll link over to the website  urlLink Hockey Erotica .  I haven't gotten a chance to read some of the featured fiction yet, but I'll enjoy reading about women who love hockey and it's players.  The author(ess) claims she's not a "puck bunny" but I'll let you judge for yourselves. The bio claims she's a So-Cal Gal and got turned on to it via "at the Pond" (She's a Mighty Ducks fan apparently) Be warned though, the content is intended for an adult audience.  Perhaps I'll try and submit my Hockey Fiction short story to her soon. I wonder if she'll publish it.

Since Pittsburgh doesn't have all that much to look forward to now, the Pens fans have turned their attention to the AHL and their Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins. I got a chance to hear them live as  FOX Sports Radio 970 AM  bent to the will of the people and decided to cover the Conference Finals round between WB Scranton Penguins and their hated rivals the Philadelphia Phantoms.

      Time for the Conference Finals - winning now is only one step closer to playing for Lord Stanley's Cup.   Western Conference   San Jose v. Calgary  Calgary hoists all Canada's pride by being the remaining Canadian franchise in the playoffs. San Jose and their "no-namers" have made it this far in a gritty system well-coached by Ron Wilson. Calgary is hoping to beat the system with upcoming stars such as team Captain Jarome Iginla and  Robyn Regehr with former Sharks goalie Kiprusoff.  Prediction: Sharks in 6    Eastern Conference   Tampa Bay v. Philadelphia  Much to my disappointment, Philadelphia is in the Conference finals. I can't stand this team. Though, they seem to be building a line chemistry with the "ex-Chicago" line Zhamnov, Roenick and Amonte. Tampa Bay are riding high on the "safe is death" philosophy. Martin St. Louis can clinch the Hart Trophy (NHL MVP) by stepping up and sending the Flyers home packing Prediction: Lightning in 6

      Na na na na... na na na na.. hey hey hey.. goodbye!  The Detroit Red Wings were eliminated tonight by the Calgary Flames to advance to the Conference finals.  Canadian fans who have been getting upset that our "Yankee" streak of winning the Stanley Cup and keeping it to American soil can breathe a sigh of relief. Calgary still has yet to face the winner of the Avalanche/Sharks series. They also have the ace in the hole, riding their success on the back of Sharks castaway Miikka Kiprusoff. "Hey guys! Remember me?"  Farewell to Steve Yzerman,  the "Rock of Gibralter", on the aging Detroit squad. He was hurt in a previous game in the Flames series ending his season. With the CBA/Strike making things hazy for a future season, it's speculative that Yzerman will retire.

      Either in a serious change of strategy with the NY Rangers or simply a choice to go separate ways, Eric Lindros has been given his walking papers so to speak according to this  urlLink Yahoo! Sports  article.  After suffering yet another concussion from Washington Capitals Jason Doig earlier in the year, Lindros' career was again put on hold. The debate now is trying to determine if it's even worth signing with another team to continue his career and risk death.  In the past, Lindros had expressed interest in playing for his hometown Maple Leafs team. I hope that doesn't happen or it will be hard for me to root for Toronto.

      Today in the RBC Center in Raleigh, NC. The NHL held their annual entry draft. I have just one word to say regarding the coverage and the events that took place.  Booorrrrring!  I was attenative for the first 3 draft selections as the Capitals (who got lucky to get the #1 position) selected the much-hyped Alexander Ovechkin and Pittsburgh Penguins had to be satisfied with Evgeni Malkin.  So, despite rumors of teams trading up, things went along as they were "supposed to". No shocking deals and no unknown draft picks were taken in the first round.      Some  COHF  Draft notables :    My "Insider" to the Capitals was on the tv screen a total of 30 seconds. The joint broadcast of Canadas TSN and USA's ESPN 2 folowed around the tables on the arena floor, but failed to capture any real drama.  History was made when two Russian-born players were selected #1 and #2 overall.  I like what I hear from the Penguins late round Picks. Dave Brown a Canadian Goalie from the University of Notre Dame and Chris Peluso a Minnesota native defenceman could be major contributers.  Christopher Bourque, son of Hall of Famer Ray Bourque, was selected in the second round by Washington.  Standing as giants among men, two blue chip Slovak players Boris Valabik (6ft. 7in. 212lbs.) was selected #10 by the Thrashers and Andrej Meszaros (6ft. 198lbs.) was selected #23 by the Senators.  Robbie Schremp, a London Knights OHL player, was selected by the Oilers, but scouts and pundits say that Schremp believes his own hype and may cause problems on the bench.  Ted Leonsis is  still  fat and sweaty.

      When a professional athlete does well, the agent who negotiated his/her contract should be able to reap some of the benefits, right?  Well, according to this  urlLink Yahoo! Sports  article, Slovak hockey star and current Minnesota Wild player, Marian Gaborik is being sued by his former agents who encouraged the young and impressionable star to hold out this past season.  Gaborik made bonuses after making the All-star team in 2003 and now the agents who arranged that contract want him to pay them an additional $275,000.

      The speculative news report on  urlLink Yahoo! Sports , tells the tale that former Penguins and Flyers winger Rick Tocchet may look to move on from his assistant coaching position.  The article stated that he had "differences" with head coach Tony Granato who was his teammate in Los Angeles at one time.  The bulk of the speculation was that Tocchet may want to get the Phoenix Coyotes job since having a good friendship with Coyotes owner Wayne Gretzky.

      I got up this morning with a feeling of "woa, what just happened", as the dreams that I had last night were still fresh in my mind.  I could remember the first part, I was high up in a generic arena seats, perhaps even looking down from the broadcast section. I was at a hockey game. Interestingly enough, neither team was my hometown favorite. I understood later that I was at a Buffalo vs. Washington game. I remember being asked by some unidentified man about which team I was rooting for. "Washington, I guess, because I know somebody who works with them," I replied. The game's action was fairly decent, but later I would get a first hand look.  The second part to the dream included me on the ice, in full uniform, ready to line up for the face off. It wasn't the same game, but I remember feeling like I was wearing the red logo of the Carolina Hurricanes. In typical fashion, I could remember skating well, but when it came time for me to take the pass for a shot at the net, my stick was out of position. The other team went the other way with the puck and scored. Again, I pretended to know what I was doing and lined up wherever for the next faceoff. Again, I kept up with the play, but the pass to me went wide. The other team scored again. I remember skating off the ice with my head low. Unfortunately, the first line took the ice dissapointed as I left already at a -2.  It's not the first time that things haven't quite worked out the way I wanted them to in my dreams. I wrote about  urlLink another dream  here where I didn't quite fit in.   Oh well, I'm sure that Sigmund Freud would have a field day trying to analyze those dreams.

      While surfing the web this afternoon, I came upon a article on the  urlLink World Wrestling Entertainment  website that breaks from their own storyline and interview several of their well-known Canadian stars and ask them about how important it was for Calgary to be in the Stanley Cup finals this year. Lance Storm, a Calgary native, shared some of the feelings that Canada had for their represenative team.  "You just can’t go anywhere. Every business has ‘Go Flames Go’ up on their billboards and their signs. … At my daughter’s school, there are several classes that are completely done up in red."  Of course, "m'girl" Trish Stratus is a hockey fan and showed her support of the Flames, despite being from the Toronto, Ontario providence and seen in ads modeling the Leafs jersey.  "It’s just a national pride thing," Trish Stratus said. "Hockey is Canada’s game. To bring the Cup home to Canada is where we feel it rightfully belongs." Stratus, born and bred in Toronto and a fan of the city’s Maple Leafs, was rooting for the Leafs. Like many (or most) Canadians, she jumped on the Flames’ bandwagon once her team was eliminated from the playoffs. "But as a Canadian I’m allowed to," she said.  Also, Christian, another Toronto native brought up this interesting point to the article linked above.  Christian adds, however, that the Flames vs. Lightning series wasn’t as simple as 'U.S. vs. Canada'. "It’s funny because there are more Canadians on Tampa Bay than there are on Calgary," he said.

      One of the hardest working goaltenders in the NHL, Nikolai Khabibulin, has decided not to attend the World Cup games this year as reported in the  urlLink The Hockey News  and seen in other sites such as  urlLink National Hockey League Official Site . This would lead you to believe that he needs time off from winning the Stanley Cup in 7 games and needs more time to prepare. However, TSN's  urlLink NHL Network  has a more in-depth write up as to why the "Boulin Wall" decided to no-show.   "We have no chance of winning based on the current situation surrounding the preparation of our national team," the Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender told Sport-Express. "I have already had a similar experience before the 1996 World Cup when there was total chaos in our organization."   He's right. The Russians have really fallen from hockey graces in international play. They were used to dominating everybody in the 70's and 80's, but since communism fell, the program hasn't gotten over the slump with the surgence of Czechoslovakian, Swedes, Fins, and even Americans. The furthest I remember them finishing was placing 3rd at the 2002 World Cup Tournament.  Russia was also hoping that San Jose Sharks goalie Evgeni Nabokov would cary the team, but is recovering from recent knee surgery this spring. That leaves Russia with Sokolov, a Russian league player, in charge for the World Cup games.

      When a local guy from South Western Pennsylvania makes it big, the fans will always support and owe loyalty to one of their own. However, should someone turn their back, then they are most certainly unfogiving and the "star" is reduced to "sellout" status.  Enter: R.J. Umberger.  As a Plum Area native (suburb of Pittsburgh), he decided to pursue hockey at the collegiate level at  Thee  Ohio State University. That should have been the first warning sign to his loyalty when everybody rivals the Buckeyes. At least the Patrick family had the decency to play for national champion Penn State for less national exposure. However, he was a hero to the area having been the first local kid to make the NHL from the "Mario era" which created interest in Pittsburgh area children to play the game. He was drafted by Vancouver, but when he was unable to come to a contract, they traded him to NY Rangers.  Follow the money.  Umberger signs with Philly according to this  urlLink NHL Network  news release. Umberger chose his wallet over loyalty and proved to a lot of NHL and Pittsburgh fans that he is only in it for the money.  Also in the news, the Flyers also signed Keith Primeau to a $17 million 4 year deal.

      As reported in  urlLink The Hockey News  the American Hockey League as passed down their edict on who should and will be eligible if an NHL lockout occurs.  The remaining players who haven't signed contracts to Europe leagues who wish to play through an NHL lockout will have to reconsider. The AHL will grant status to those players with 50 NHL games or more.  That screws a lot of players like Marc Andre Fleury who has only 1 or 2 games to his AHL credit.  I say that all those who want to stay in the states and wait out the inevitable lockout, they should sign temporary contracts to ECHL and UHL teams. That way, they could expand interest in those leagues, drive up ticket sales in those markets, and improve the overall exposure that the minor leagues should get. It will only benefit the future of hockey when the league has a better minor league system to work with, that way, they can develop more star-calibur players.

       Okay, I don't realy feel like I need to say a lot about this issue, but it's been known for quite some time that people and investors wanted to revive the WHA of the old days. Much like the NBA had it's rival ABA and the NFL had it's USFL, hockey fans will soon be given an alternative to the NHL. TSN's  urlLink NHL Network  has an article about it. I'll outline some more of the finer or more interesting points here.    WHA Commisioner is NHL legend Bobby Hull   Entry Draft will be open to players 17 years of age   Halifax, Quebec City, Detroit, Dallas, Orlando and Jacksonville are the original 6 teams. Toronto and Hamilton to soon join   $15 million dollar salary cap    Rule Changes :  no red-line, no-touch icing, touch-up offside and three-on-three overtime followed by a shootout.    Halifax (Metro Centre), Quebec City (Le Colisee Pepsi), Detroit (Pontiac Silverdome), Dallas (Reunion Arena), Orlando (TD Waterhouse Center) Jacksonville, Fla. (Memorial Arena), Toronto (SkyDome) and Hamilton (Copps Coliseum) are all old hockey arenas expected to hold the WHA games.    The NHL had better get to signing that CBA soon or the WHA will have a leg on them and steal away all their good players. They have their eyes on phenom Sidney Crosby and hope to "steal" him away before he turns 18 from the NHL. Is that Salary Cap in Canadian, American or Australian Dollars?

      With thanks to  HockeyNation  for the story, most Tampa residents and hockey fans are wondering why their NHL championship team does not get any respect. What makes it worse is that their own hometown  urlLink Tampa Tribune  newspaper didn't give them a chance to win.  Apparently, the early morning edition to todays paper will consist of a  Mea Culpa  (see: "my bad") to the Florida citizens for preparing their Sports colums as if the Flames had won.  Don't believe me? Canada was also almost duped in the hopeful tease.  urlLink Toronto Star  has an AP article.

      According to a TSN's  urlLink NHL Network article,  Bourque and Coffey might as well mark Nov. 8 in their datebooks now because that's when the formal ceremonies will take place.  Yup, sometimes news like this makes me feel old. When players that I grew up watching have all retired and qualify for the Hall of Fame, then it's time to say "where has the time gone". Definitely Bourque and Coffey belong in the Hall of Fame. They redefined their blueliner (see: Defenceman) position. Not only were they solid on the even strength battles, but they showed their skill by shooting and passing the puck on the powerplay. Both players racked up points, especially Coffey who collected them like Cups. Coffey was an integral part to the Edmonton Oilers and Pittsburgh Penguin dynasties.

      Congratulations to Tampa Bay and NHL veteran Dave Andreychuk for winning the Stanley Cup, the NHL's historic championship trophy. It was a gritty first period and both teams were trying their best to beat one another up. Calgary got caught with a couple of boarding calls leading to a Ruslan Fedotenko Power Play Goal (PPG). In the end, "the Boulin Wall" stood taller than the Finnish phenom Kiprusoff. Both teams goalies stood on their heads and made great saves. Tampa finished the game with a 2-1 win. The best moment of the night was Andreychuk who got to finally hold the Cup over his head after a long NHL career. They featured him several times during the game as well as the first period intermission. The St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa was filled along with a large gathering outside the gates watching the coverage on big screen.

      My Penguins couldn't quite do it tonight and got blown out despite a sold out white-wearing Whachovia Arena at Casey Plaza. Milwaulkee Admirals are the Calder Cup champions of the American Hockey League. Their veteran-enhanced roster blew out the Rochester "Amerks" and took care of Scranton in timely fashion, winning that series 4-0. The Admirals are the third IHL team to win the Calder Cup since the IHL disbanded and the AHL welcomed the additional teams with open arms. (Chicago and Houston are the other two teams)  I forgot to keep you all updated on the ECHL - the "AA" of minor league hockey.  Idaho Steelheads are this year's Kelly Cup champs defeating the Florida Everblades on May 22nd. Another hockey team from Florida? Wow. Hockey has really grown into a North American sport, reaching for fans from all over.

      Dave Andreychuk captain of the Tampa Bay Lightning returned to his native Hamilton, Ontario, Canada with the one prize that had aluded him for 25 years - The Stanley Cup.  He was greeted as a hero in Mountain Arena according to this  urlLink TSN article  and showered with a lot of gifts.  A jersey that he first wore when he was a little leaguer, a framed photo of him first holding the Stanley Cup, a parade, fireworks display, an honorary captains jersey to the AHL Hamilton Bulldogs, and the really impressive item... the arena became The Dave Andreychuk Mountain Arena.  I suppose Hamiltinians will do whatever it took to get a NHL team in the city. I'm sure they also may have alterior motives for honoring their city's favorite son. They put on a grand show to make it look that Hamilton loves hockey and will support a pro team there. This may be true, but the CBA agreement has to come first before any of those questions are answered.

      Today, I played with some of my fellow Pittsburgh Penguins fans in a roller hockey game at  urlLink Bladerunners  in Harmarville, PA. I had a great time with memories that will last a lifetime.  One of the things in my life that really I wish I had more of, it's friends who enjoy the kind of things I do. I used to skate with my brother and some friends in the neighborhood, but that only lasted one summer back in High School. I played some in college, but that was only a couple of times too.  As it turned out,  urlLink Bladerunners  was behind this grocery store that I drove by all the time on the way to my brother's current apartment.  The game itself was awesome. We had a good turn out at Bladerunners. But when I got to the door, I was surprised at the idea that it cost money to play. Okay, so I was out $10.  I gave it my best shot. However, there were people there with better speed and skill than I, so after about an hour. Nobody would pass me the puck. So, I did the "sensible" thing and volunteered myself for goaltender. (For some reason, the other goaltender couldn't make it. So, without any pads, I did my best stopping shot after shot.) The Message Board said I was crazy others said I was courageous, but I didn't care what they thought.  Afterwards, we all went to the local  urlLink Primanti's  for a bite.

      The cable channel  urlLink E! Network  is no stranger to T&A television, so this new TV show  urlLink Scream Play  should be no surprise as&nbsp;what to expect. This obvious "Fear Factor" rip-off, suddenly got my attention as the opening stunt featured a tie-in to a hockey movie.   One of the competitors named the 1977 movie "Slapshot" as his favorite&nbsp;movie of all time. So, the makers of the Scream Play program&nbsp;thought it wise to recreate the scene where a player in the movie strips off his uniform to&nbsp;help his teammates score a goal during the distraction. Scream Play thought they could&nbsp;close off a rink and shoot a stunt where&nbsp;3 teams of 2 players played broom-ball in the buff! The winner would spend a weeks vacation in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.   That's right. Naked Hockey.   The female to male ratio was 4-2, so you know it had my attention. The game started at center ice, the two players pulled off their jerseys and proceeded to knock their balls into the goal as quickly as possible. Standing on street shoes and not on skates, the danger was hoping that no one fell hurting a boob or something.  The host did the play-by-play and obviously did not see the movie. He tried citing "Oggie's" name a few times just to get the tie in along with any other random name/movie reference he could. He was a tool.   I don't know if I would've done it, I don't have the kind of body to be an exhibitionist like those players on TV. From what I could tell through the pixilation blur, I liked the one contestant's back tattoo.

      The rogue WHA hockey league held their draft in a casino gambling on which NHL Free Agents that the league can possibly persuade to sign.   Simon Gagne was the first free agent selected by the Quebec Nordiks.&nbsp; Followed by Trent Green of the Boston Bruins.  Then on Sunday, the WHA decided that it could probably lure some young stars to play in the league at age 17. Of Course, Sidney Crosby was selected first.  I don't know how sucessful their draft is going to be. They didn't ask anyone if they actually wanted to join, they just took turns randomly selecting names.  This reminds me when the RHI (Roller Hockey International) started. It was a real joke. They even drafted people who weren't even hockey players. I think Tonya Harding was drafted.  I don't really have too much to say about this, so go check up on some of my friends websites and see what they have to say about the WHA.

      It looks as if another NHL veteran has decided to call it a career. According to  urlLink Yahoo! Sports , Ron Francis was offered a front office job with the franchise that he has known the most in his 20+ years.   Ronnie "Franchise" was originally drafted by the Hartford Whalers, but after 9 seasons, he was traded to the Penguins to win the Stanley Cup. He also brought the Whalers to the Finals in their current Carolina Hurricanes form. Last season, he made a run for the Stanley Cup as a Toronto Maple Leaf. Originally reported in the  urlLink Raleigh News & Observer  newspaper, Ronnie "Franchise" will be a welcome relief to the franchise he's helped build.

      In light of a NHL lockout season, the National Hockey League has made public their 2004-05 schedule.   Begining with October 13th, the NHL drops the puck on it's 88th season. The Tampa Bay Lightning raises the Stanley Cup banner (plus a Southeast Division and Eastern Conference banner) on that day with a game against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Lightning and Flames won't get a rematch until Nov. 11th.  Some other dates most notable on the schedule will be the Hall of Fame game featuring the Leafs and Bruins on Nov. 6th, the All-Star Game in Atlanta on February 12th, and Tampa Bay will also take part in the leagues only neutral-site game against Buffalo on Oct 18th in Rochester, NY.  Hockey Day in Canada, which is considered a national holiday, will be covered by CBC on Feb 19th with Ottawa at Montreal, Edmonton at Toronto and Calgary at Vancouver.  My Pittsburgh Penguins start the year on the road against the NY Rangers on October 15th and come home to play the Rangers again on the 16th.  From a Yahoo! Sports article, I find this most newsworthy  For the first time in NHL history, all 30 teams will be in action on March 26. A lineup of 14 games has taken place nine times, most recently on November 1, 2003.

      The American Hockey League, the minors to the NHL, have elected to make a few changes to the way the game is played for next season. In this article at the  urlLink Pittsburgh Post Gazette  it underlines a few things being changed for the upcomming 2004-05 AHL season. If all goes well, they will be suggested to the NHL and adopted there as rule changes to their games.     Adopting a no-touch icing rule as is used in international play. Play will be blown dead as soon as the puck crosses the goal line.  Using a shootout to decide regular-season games tied after a five-minute overtime.  Returning to the "tag-up" offside rules the league used from 1986-96. Players who are caught in the offensive zone in a delayed-offside situation can negate the offside by "tagging up" with the blue line.  Increasing the size of the neutral zone by moving nets from 13 feet in front of the end boards to 11 and expanding the width of the blue lines and center-ice red line from 12 to 24 inches. Passes from the defensive edge of one blue line to the offensive edge of the other will be legal.  Also, for the first seven weeks of the 2004-05 season, the AHL will experiment with rules that restrict where goalies are allowed to play the puck.    I don't see why any of these drastic rule changes are going to solve much of anything in the NHL. The game is fine the way it is. Experts argue that the rule changes, especially the one about "no-touch" icing would make the game flow faster. The icing rule won't stop anything. The players will only ice the puck as much as they did. Only this time, there won't be as much time lost for a player to get to the puck. It won't do a darn thing in strategy. It's also bad on the goalies who can move the puck well. If you restrict their play, there will be even more stoppages. Errors do occur with goalies who mis-handle the puck and when that happens, usually a good team can take advantage of that and score. The overtime rules is just REALY dumb. I don't know of anyone who will be willing enough to sit around even longer to see a game end, most "fair weather" fans are already making their way to the parking lots at the end of regulation.

      In the summer off season months, the NHL owners and gemneral managers assess their standings while going over their financials and player needs. But this year is unique as both players and owners don't know what is in store for the future of the league.  This summer has brought on some surprising signings already since the free agency season started on July 1st.  Mark Recchi has returned to the team that drafted him today as the Penguins have signed him to a deal with the terms of the deal not disclosed. The theory around town here is that the Penguins and Recchi don't want to affect any other NHL signings in the market by "comparison shopping". Thus keeping it on "the down low".  Gretzky's Coyotes have been throwing around some money signing 2 NHL veterans so far. Red Wings' Devereaux and the Sharks Ricci have signed deals to play in Glendale, AZ. Two good pick ups for them... a team that still doesn't have a coach.  Boston Bruins captain Joe Thorton decided to go to Europe during what he expects to be a long lock out. There is a clause in the Swiss team contract that states he can go back to the NHL once the CBA is resolved.

      With a humongus three patriotic cheers for Debbye living and working in Toronto, ON go check out her blog. I highly endorse it.  urlLink Being American in T.O. Trackback  The link shown takes you to a post she made about the ongoing saga of controversial coach turned broadcaster Don Cherry of the CBC. The Editorial in the  Toronto Sun  suggests that Coach Cherry would have to undergo some sort of sensitivity training to understand why the Bloc Quebeccois is so super-sensitive and hyper-offended™. It goes on to say that an independand audit supports that hockey players who wear face shields are "europeans and french guys". I just can't understand what the heck is so controversial about this statement. Coach Cherry is now proven to be stating a fact and people have to get all huffy-and-puffy about it. Get over yourselves, Quebec.

      Okay. I'm glad that this is actualy following through. I'd hate for pro athletes, especially one as careless as Dany Heatly was, to go free when he was responsible for the unfortunate death of a teammate. In this  urlLink Yahoo! Sports  article link, the Atlanta athorities are planning to move ahead with the investigation and file charges against the one time rookie of the year.  The most serious charge Heatley could face is vehicular homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.  I think that's a real sobering quote in the article.

      Back in 2002 and inspired by a surge of interest in Canadian culture, I had decided to spend July 1st simulating hockey games on my Playstation. This year, the tradition continues! Like last year, I chose to simulate a national style tournament instead of a "one and done" format like 2002. I set up two pools, eastern and western, with the 6 remaining NHL Canadian teams and the 2 transplanted teams in USA that used to represent Quebec and Winnepeg. There they each played two games a piece to decide the tournament seatings. I also used up to the minute rosters barring free agent or injury status, however, I did remove the players who retired or chose to sign with European teams. This tournament this year was an all Quebec final as the Nordiques met up with their rival Montreal. I suppose it was the additions of Bonk and Kovalev that improved the Canadians this year. It was a strong match up even to the overtime. Steve Begin scored in the extra tie breaking session this year to put Montreal 3-2. Quebec put up a valient effort, though. The leading scorers in the tournament was Joe Sakic (6-6-12) and Ryan Smyth (7-4-12).    Previous Canada Day Champions 2002: Toronto Maple Leafs 2003: Edmonton Oilers

      One of the most highly sought after Hockey Free Agents have landed in the desert. Brett Hull signed a 2 year deal with the Phoenix Coyotes according to this  urlLink Yahoo! Sports  article. The money part was not released. I suppose that having Gretzky for an owner is starting to pay off. The Coyotes have really been active this season acquiring quite oa few. Brett is no stranger to the "Great One" I'm sure that influence was the deal breaker. The Penguins and the Stars were also interested in the Free Agent Hull. Brett is also friends with Mario Lemieux... and has said he would've liked to play with/for Mario sometime in his career.

      What could they possibly be waiting for?  Today, the NHL and the NHLPA met in Toronto, ON, Canada and according to all the major sports sources (and several other fellow bloggers). The two sides failed to reach any progress on the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  This is really starting to make me worry. My best guess is that they will stretch out the talks until the 11th hour and sign anything to get the season in on time.  NHL and NHLPA did however agree to meet again on August 17th.

      Well, I was shocked and dissapointed to read on my hometown team's website that the Pittsburgh Penguins are going to create a new squad called  urlLink "Penguins Patrol."   They are calling for young women (at least 19 years of age) to walk around the Mellon Arena and do the PR work with the fans. It's a lot like the "Spirit Squad" that they had this year, but not with the costumes or dancing.  Of course, I could take this post and start talking about the cheerleading in hockey, but I'd skewer off to a tangent and talk about my ax to grind with an evil Canadian website.. I'm not in the mood to right now though.  Feel free to check out the link above and give me your feedback about hockey maybe needing cheerleaders.
