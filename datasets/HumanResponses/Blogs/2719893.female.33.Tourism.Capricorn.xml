      May 17-23  I arrived in Virginia late Sunday night.  Monday morning, I got up and got my bearings, so to speak.  Talked to a couple people--Angela, Debbie's occupational therapist, Lois, the nurse practitioner at UVA, and my other sister, Michelle, and brother, Allan.  In the afternoon, I went to the nursing home.  While this place is a lot better than the first place she was sent, my initial impression was not especially positive.  I stood at the front desk, trying to find out Debbie's location for about 10 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement, while the receptionist sat on the phone on what was obviously a personal phone call.  I saw some other personnel walk by in the hallway, so I asked them, and one woman walked me down to her room.  She was laying in bed, but looked a whole lot better than the last time I saw her at the UVA University Hospital in Charlottesville.  In the course of the week, I met several of the staff there.  Cindy (physical therapist), Brenda (nurse), and Mike (social worker) were of great help.  While Cindy worked at Debbie's speed, I think the occupational therapist, Angela, doesn't know how to work outside the proverbial box.  There's a specific plan this health system uses, and she sticks to it no matter what the patient's condition.  Debbie gets really frustrated in dealing with her.  Overall, it's not too bad, but it is indeed true of any nursing home type place--the more of a presence family have, the more attention a patient gets.  Unlike the first place she was at (Highland Ridge Rehab), there were a lot more patients there who were more coherent.  Well...most, but not all.  There was one lady who "strolled" around in her wheelchair.  One day, she came to the door and asked for someone, another day, she simply wheeled herself in, not acknowledging either Debbie or myself, and rolled up to the empty bed in the room.  She first started wiping some invisible stuff off of her hands, then when we asked if we could help her, she informed us that this was where Martha Jane stays when she was there, but would be staying with this woman once she went home....  It's hard to say where Debbie stands at this point.  While she looks good, and sounds pretty good most of the time, she still gets confused in some ways.  She's easily tired, and on Wednesday, I felt like we were going round and round.  She kept trying to eat sugar to get a burst of energy, and was not comprehending that the fatigue was from her extremely low blood counts.  Just the simple statement of "You are tired because your blood count is low." was incomprehensible to her.  The next day, I found a better way of explaining it--started by talking about the white blood cells and red blood cells, then explained that there are not many of either in her blood.  She understood that.  Michelle came out over the weekend, and we took Max, her Springer spaniel, to see her, too.  There was one point when he jumped up on her and licked her entire face that she just started laughing.  This was the first time all week that I saw that.  I talked to my brother today.  Debbie's stay at the rehab place falls under managed care, so each week, reports are submitted on her progress.  Every week we pray (and you can too) that she doesn't start hitting a plateau.  Once she does, insurance will no longer pay for her physical and occupational therapy.  He talked to the Lois up at UVA, too.  Her blood counts are improving.  Once she leaves the rehab place, she will be going to Illinois to stay with my brother for awhile.  Before she leaves Virginia, she will have to go up to UVA to sort of have a "sign-off" from her neuro-oncologist up there and is having an MRI to check to see how the tumor is behaving at the moment.  If I can, I am going to take off to take her to that appointment.  Lois wants one of us to be there for that.  I really want to be there since I tend to be the one who "gets it" in terms of the medical information.

      I forgot to put this part in the initial e-mail I sent to people.  This is what is known as a blog, short for web log, in layman's terms, an online journal.    Feel free to look around, click on anything that is clickable, etc.  Below each entry should be (as long as it works consistently) a line saying who posted (probably mostly me), what time (probably lots of late night entries...that's just me), and a spot that says comments.  Feel especially free to click there and leave a comment or say hello or send a message to pass along to Debbie.  That's how I know you're out there.  As I work on this site, I will also add other nifty little features and will mention them from time to time.  So, if you are new to the concept, hope you enjoy it!  I will post an actual update on Debbie at the end of my trip this week, but before Sunday.

      I have decided to create a separate blog for updates about Debbie, her health issues, and anything else that falls into that category.  The short story is she has a malignant brain tumor.  After about a year of coasting through chemotherapy and radiation, it went from "My sister has brain tumor." to "MY SISTER HAS A BRAIN TUMOR!"  She had some serious complications in April and is still recovering from that, but, I am glad to say that she is constantly making progress now.  I will try to keep it more on the lighthearted side--which explains the title above.  I will share:  Debbie got finally got her diagnosis in January 2003 (after having her first noticeable seizure in October 2002).  I made arrangements and took a 30 day leave from work for the month of March 2003.  Debbie and Michelle (hereinafter referred to as "my sisters") both have early March birthdays, so Michelle met us in Blacksburg and we spent the first weekend celebrating the birthdays.  I remember as we walked into Wal-Mart, Debbie bought a bottle of water from the vending machine, opened it, took a large swig and abruptly made a funny face.  She had a sudden case of brain freeze from the cold water.  My immediate comeback was "It can't hurt...maybe it will help!"  She laughed.  So, since so many people are keeping her on prayer lists, I thought this would be an ideal type of way to keep people updated.

      I talked to my brother a little while ago.  Debbie has another week approved by the insurance.  She hasn't hit a plateau in their *expert* eyes yet.  She will be going up to University of Virginia in the next couple weeks to see her neuro-oncologist and to have an MRI.  After that, she will travel to Illinois to stay with my brother for awhile.  Not sure how long that will be.

      Debbie went into the hospital in Danville on Monday night.  Over the weekend, she was having even more difficulty walking and communicating.  It was suggested by someone that she have another MRI to check to see if there's been growth since last month when we went to get the one done in Charlottesville.  She went to the Emergency Room Monday, and they did a CT scan, where they found that there was a great deal of swelling going on in her brain.  She is now up to 24mg of Decadron/day (translation A LOT!!) which causes a great amount of swelling in her body but reduces the swelling in her brain.  I haven't talked to her.  I have talked to my sister, Michelle, my brother, and my dad.  Dad said that Debbie did feel better on Tuesday.  On a side note, this is a blessing that she's in the hospital, because Tuesday, there was a HUGE thundestorm that rolled through the area.  The south half of the county is without power, including my brother's house since it hit (about 4pm CDT) and won't have any until Friday sometime!!  His office and the office where Michelle works is also without power.

      Debbie's been at my brother's home in IL now for about 11 days.  I think the biggest issue happening at the moment is getting her to take her medicine on time/at fairly regular intervals.  While any of us siblings has no problem telling her to do it, my sister-in-law is not yet comfortable telling her what to do when it comes to things that must be done.  She is spending a lot of time in bed, but her physical therapist from Salem anticipated that happening, plus she has always been inclined to veg out a lot, anyway.  They do have some home health care involved--mostly for bathing a couple times a week.  Because the home health care team is involved, they suggest that she not do a lot of running around while the insurance covers it b/c of the possibility of injury while she is out--if she's at Walmart, gets hurt and an ambulance is involved, the hha can be charged with fraud.  It's ALL so complicated--why can't they just let her live her life.  I feel like putting these restrictions out there could almost shorten her time. As it is, when she was in the nursing home, she felt like everything was out of control because a lot of the staff at the nursing home wouldn't listen to her input.  Several times we had to remind certain staff members "She has a brain tumor, she's not stupid".  The feelings of things being out of control does not help her rest and try to get things on track.  Even the fact that either she didn't remember or wasn't told about her appointment with her doctor at UVA when I was there really disturbed her, and she told one of the doctors at the clinic that day that she felt like they were hiding things because no one was talking to her directly like they had in the past.
