      Okay, if this entry gets posted, the problem between Blogger's updated WYSIWYG editor and Camino (my current default) has been solved. *crosses fingers*

      Lately, I don't know what's gotten into me. I have a lot chances to get out of the house but I usually end up on my 'book for the rest of the day. Sure, I go out to exercise at the park 2-3 times a week, go to the occasional dinner with friends, and take side excursions to the movie theater or my favorite store. But I think something really hit me the other day after I had gone to watch the action film  I, Robot . I normally go to watch a film (or two) by myself because it can be a task in itself to schedule a group gathering of my friends (hence we only regularly meet for special [i.e., birthdays and other special occasions] dinners), so I always try to catch a film during its third, fourth week to escape the crowds. Well, as you probably know,  I, Robot  just opened so I ended up braving the crowds to watch the film and maybe it was a mistake. Even though the theater was filled to near capacity, I eerily felt out of place by myself in that huge theater and if I had the power to shrink into nothingness, I probably would use that super ability. Going to watch a film after it had played for a while, you tend to see the same type of people. I.e., people like myself who are watching the same film, in the same theater, by themselves. I think it's time to take a breath of fresh air. To get back into the world and join the masses.  Btw, it looks like Blogger's WYSIWYG editor is working on Safari now although it's still not working on Camino (my default web browser).

      (Due to a problem with non-IE web browsers and Blogger's updated editor [of which I found out  after  the fact], the entry I had written was erased upon posting it onto my weblog. That sucked, but I guess it's the price of free. I've tried to edit this post -- albeit unsuccessfully  -- with Shira [which already counts Safari and OmniWeb 5 out], and nothing works on Camino, so I'm now editing with Firefox although there's still the problem with the progress indicator. I've learned my lesson to write my posts outside of Blogger's editor and to always check the  urlLink Blogger Status  [there's an RSS feed which definitely helps]. Geez, this is already longer than my original post. *sigh*)

      I often feel like I'm searching for something that isn't always there. I'll reach out thinking that I'll finally grab onto it, but in the end, the only thing felt by my fingers is the empty palm of my hand. While others easily grasp what they know they are destined for, some of us don't even know when to reach out, or others extend their hands in the air at anything that comes their way. I am/have been part of the two "clueless" groups and lately it's caused me to become uncertain of my future. I know that I often think into things too much where I should just let the way of life flow, but as I'm getting older, so I believe the flow of life is becoming narrower; so narrow that the only thing remaining at the end are tiny droplets that will later dry out. It's not that I believe I can't change anything; it's just at this point in time, all seems lost. I am lost.

      I'll post more later on today. For now, I'm dead tired and I think I may be coming down with something. :(

      Fooling around in the Blogger "Dashboard" is a lot of fun! I've added a couple of things to the sidebar and I also edited my  urlLink User Profile  page. Geez, it's already past midnight! One thing I wish Blogger would add to the free accounts is the Blogger favicon. I think that would make a cool touch to an already promising blogging tool.

      I finally left the "UK" group. I really feel bad about it but my life's a lot less complicated as a result, so as bad as it is, I'll just have to live with it. I emailed them (I sent the message to both leaders of the group) yesterday and I haven't received a reply so I don't know what their thoughts are on my exiting the group. Tomorrow night I have practice with one of the other members of the group so maybe I'll hear something from her. I just hope that they're not  that  upset with me and that they'll continue our friendship outside of the group. We'll see.

      I'm now blogging on Blogger again. :) Everything looks really nice and I'm using a template that was designed by  urlLink Jeffrey Zeldman ! Awesome!
