						   So, I saw the funniest bumper sticker the other day while I was driving. It said "Save the environment, plant a Bush back in Texas". True, it is not a knee slapper or a pants wetter by any means, but it just was funny considering what had happened earlier that day. Now, you may be asking yourself, "But what happened that day? Oh, elighten us mortals with your infinite wisdom!" OK, ok...you forced it out of me. Now you may rise from your knees.  A good friend of mine in Atlanta sent out a forwarded email to a group of us. I opened it to read because he tends to send stuff that will either make me giggle, cringe, or say "hmmmmmmm". This particular email was a politically based one about being a republican. I sent a little response back to be playful, and apparently I wasn't the only one. Had more people truly cared, it could have turned into quite the lively debate.  You know what...I just realized that story was much funnier in my head when the little men with the high pitched voices where whispering it....so just forget everything I said...except for saving the environment. Smooches!

						   OK....for those of you not engrossed in the hallowed halls of academia, let me lay a little wisdom down upon you (now would be the time to grab your stone slabs and chisels children). It appears, the more education one aquires in their life, the more common sense they loose in the process. Maybe the human mind is indead like a cup. You can only fill it so much before it begins to, in fact, spill. This causing a big ole mess, and inevitably, someone will slip and bust a hip.  Case in point. I was recently privey to a story of a faculty member at my university who, in her infite wisdom, sent an email to computer support to tell them that her email wasn't working. Thank God that little pony express guy that lives in your computer was able to run that message over to us. These are the kinds of people that caused there to be a need for warning labels.  Oh, but it does not end there...I can further defend my case. In my building, we have two departments who both use one workroom ( a reciepe for disaster, I agree, but also a source of countless hours of aggrevation, so it's all worthwhile). Now, in order to prevent the grubby little students (as a recent graduate, I can honestly say that is the best way to describe them) from plundering the offcie supplies as they walk down the hall, we ask all of the faculty and staff to please shut the door after they use the room. First, we simply verbalkly asked them. This seemed to not seep in. They gave us the same look a 5 year old gives you when you try to explain to them exactly where the water in the toilet goes and why it's not a good thing for keys to go there was well.  Second attempt, we sent a mass email to everyone reminding them to keep the door shut, in addition to posting a neon green sign over the light switch which says "Shut off the lights and close the door". That worked for about a week. Then, mysteriously, the door started leaving itself open and the light left itself on (this must have been the case since none of these PhD possessing people would admit to being the culprit).  In a final feeble attempt to get them to shut the door, we made a HUGE, neon orange arrow which points to a newly enlarged Neon green sign asking them to shut off the liughts and close the door. That worked for about 2 weeks.  My next step involves electricity, a sponge, and a lot of duct tape.

						   So, I am officially becoming one of those people I detest. A carb counter. I am not exatcly sure why I am putting myself through Hell on wheat toast to conform to some image that society has set, but I am. Don't get me wrong, I'm not like some huge Zepplin that decendes from on high just long enough to engulf another peice of cake, but I am not small either. I guess I am lucky in that I have a good bit of muscle mass to go along with the "chunkiness". Just love that word, don't you! (BTW, if you said yes, then you are one of the people who should stop reading this right now).  I have always had issues with my weight/personal appearance. Everyone remembers the funny fat kid in the group....who may not have been as attractive as everyone else, but he/she made them all laugh and feel good. Yeah, that was me...and on behalf of all of us, Suck it! It was no fun being that kid. And it's even less fun in the appearance obessessed culture in which we live in.  So, I will eat my whole wheat pasta, and drink my water, and suffer silently. But, the next skinny bitch that walks by is getting a fist in the top of their head.

						   I am upset. Let me tell you why. Anyone who knows me, knows that I have taken to listening to a radio station out of Atlanta. I think their morning show is funny and they usually play decent music. Well, this station tied into my American Idol fanaticism by following the competition very closely, especially Diana, the contestant from Snellville, GA. Well, as all Idol fans know, Diana lost and Fantasia Barrino won (true, I was actually rooting for LaToya London, but Fantasia was my second choice, and she really needed it more than anyone else there).  Well, Fantasia released her single, as all Idol winners do (which was a pretty good single, 3 songs for $4, not bad). Well...instead of playing Fantasia's single, like they should be, they are playing Diana's version! Correct me if I am wrong, didn't she lose?  Now, I am not one to play the race card often, but this smells of a little bigotry to me. Lets look at the facts.  1) Kelly Clarkson wins the first idol, and the Atlantean (Tamyra Gray) gets the boot. Does the station keep talking to Tamayra after she is kicked off and then proceed to try and boost her career, no...they jump ship and swing to kelly (the white artist).  2) Ruben Studdard (black artist) wins the second Idol, yet I barley heard any of Ruben's songs on their station, yet I hear Clay Aiken (the loser) almost everyday for months.  3) Fantasia wins...and you know the story here.  You make your own decisions.

						   So....it's been a little while since I have posted any new blogs. I have had writers block. I would start one, then halfway through, I would think it was stupid and erase it. So, lets catch you up to what's been going on.  I went to Pride in Atlana with some friends about 2 weeks ago now. It was fun. I always enjoy spending time with my Atlanta friends, since I don't see them much. It was an interesting weekend, to say the least. Had a lot of funny experiences, a few disturbing ones....can't wait to do it again! ;O)
