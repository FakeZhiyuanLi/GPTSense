      I used to think I had the answers to everything But now I know That life doesn't always go my way Feels like I'm caught in the middle That's when I realize  CHORUS  I'm not a girl, not yet a woman All I need is time, a moment that is mine While I'm in between I'm not a girl  There is no need to protect me It's time that I Learn to face up to this on my own I've seen so much more than you know now So don't tell me to shut my eyes  CHORUS - repeat  But if you look at me closely You will see it in my eyes This girl will always find her way  CHORUS  (I'm not a girl) I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe (Not yet a woman) I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah (All I need is time) Oh, all I need is time (A moment that is mine) That's mine While I'm in between I'm not a girl, not yet a woman, no no All I need is time, a moment that is mine While I'm in between I'm not a girl, ooh Not yet a woman  this is sooooooo me        poohgirl

      hey i have this cousin her name is crystal she thinks i like these guys named flip spencer keith and evan but i don't like none of them. the last two keith and evan r really ugly. i would never go out with them and evan i can't stand him i hate him. as for spencer i don't like him that way either. ya i admit that he is hott but i will never go out with him i kind of look at him as a close friend because what ever i say to him he dosn't go tell every one. he is like the most perfect friend you could have besides on his bad days. lol. just kidding spencer. but if i rated him from 1 to 10 in friendly he would get 9 because he does get in his moods. and as for flip i don't like him either i can't even say he is friendly because i don't even know him at all. and spencer if you read this don't take it the wrong way. well gonna miss everyone in the school besides evan and keith. but ALL  you guys(spencer flip crystal courtney) gave me some thing to talk about and made it fun stating there hope to keep in touch. if you want my new phone # are address just ask during school. hope to see you agian. and keep coming back to see if i am saying any thing to guys. well talk at ya lata. luv ya all.  forever remebered poohgirl

       Today one of my friends came up and asked me why i allways talk about spener. i didn't want to tell her why there. the reason why is because he is the first boy i can trust. i can tell him anything and he is there to listen and dosen't go telling every one. but latley the rumor that i like him is going around and now he won't talk to me. that is why i am kinda mad at everyone in that school.                poohs girl
