      1. People who roll their eyes when you ask them where to find something.  Does your minimum wage ass have something better to do right now other than your job?  Beatdown.  2. Clerks who yap their traps on the phone the entire time they are ringing up my shit, never even bothering to make eye contact with me.  Beatdown.  3. Customers who insist the grapes are $1.76 per lb., not $1.79, requiring the rest of us to wait while management scurries off to check the sign and inform said customer 10 minutes later that she is wrong.  Beatdown.

Beatdown.  6) Fan of Michael Moore?  5 ton beatdown.  7) If you pull out and cut me off just to drive 20 mph below the speed limit, run over, beatdown, and a round with a fungo bat.  8) Allow your 13 year old daughter to dress like a whore and wonder why grown men stare at her?  Beatdown.  9) Think Rush Limbaugh and Reverend Al Sharpton are accurate truthsayers for the right and left wing respectively?  Beatdown.  10) Snore so I stay awake?  Beatdown.  Joke 'em if they can't take a fuck.

      Simple: People who can't shut the fuck up and thus make what should be a 10 minute meeting take an hour and a half, discussing such things as which hotel rewards programs are better than others, so I can't get my own work done, and will now be here until midnight (after leaving to play softball and coming back).&nbsp; They, and our opponents tonight, get a beatdown.

BEATdown. 4.&nbsp; Sales clerks at Von Maur who follow you around when you're dressed in your gardening clothes but wanted to stop and look for a dress for a semi-formal occasion the next week before getting dirty and then point you to the sales racks to look at leftover mumus because your overalls used to belong to an old,&nbsp;incredibly obese&nbsp;farmer named Harlan who was four feet tall and they think if they take their eyes off you you're going to shove the over-priced $400 dress inside said overalls.&nbsp; I'm still beating that bitch down.&nbsp; Down, girl!! 5.&nbsp; My ex-boyfriend, Twit, and his new girlfriend, Twat.&nbsp; Much beating.&nbsp; With big sticks. 6.&nbsp; The people who program the stoplights incorrectly so my poor car has to lurch to work because of a three second delay.&nbsp; Beatdown.

      1) If you smoke later in the evening and complain about the smell in the morning, you get a beatdown.  2) If you think it was a smart move for Mr. Kerry to let his wife speak at the DNC and open her up to political attack, you deserve a beatdown.  3) If you judge a way of thinking without reading it, beatdown. (I'm reading it to see what the psychosis is about)  4) If you blame the weather for making your hair friz, and not the wild romp in bed you got the night before, you deserve a beatdown.  5) If you're female and don't vote on my poll on my site, you deserve a beatdown.  6) Democrat?

      1. If you smoke in the morning and then sit next to me on the bus so that I get to smell a wet ashtray all the way to work, you deserve a beatdown.   2. If you say that Teresa Heinz-Kerry is too mouthy and opinionated and you conveniently ignore the glaring double standard between men and women in the public eye, you deserve a beatdown.   3. Scientologist? Beatdown.   4. The weather is so muggy that my towel has not dried out for two days. Beatdown.   5. Ann Coulter, you deserve the biggest beatdown of all for being such a twat that you would attack  Max Cleland and belittle his patriotism and his war wounds. The guy lost three limbs in heavy combat during the Vietnam War and you accuse of him of lying about how it happened? What kind of fucking insect are you? I'm sorry, I do a disservice to insects everywhere by associating you with them. You are a goddamned turd and I hope you choke on your tongue.   Courtesy of  urlLink Sloth

      Now I realize being a waiter/waitress is a difficult job, so let me start this out by saying that there were only 3 or 4 other tables of people in the whole restaurant, and I think she only had one other table apart from ours.  To the waitress who made us wait a half hour for our check, gave it to us, then disappeared for another 20 minutes, so we had to find the manager to pay, just so we could get out of there: Beatdown with a side of fries!  Hope you liked your "tip."

      To people who join homeschooling groups, make the group all about them, their children's needs and their own agenda and then NEVER show up again.  Phone calls are answered sweetly, plans are made, but nothing ever comes of any of it.  I'm sick to death of you people.  I have a busy life, I do not need to be picking up the shit you left behind in your wake and now you've made it impossible for me to start my own homeschooling group here in our teeny tiny town.

      Mangers who are annoyingly paranoid about launching my new product because he/she doesn’t think I have thought of every single last contingency and continues to insiste on delays.   Yes, I’ve got all the normal contingencies in place (technical, non-technical).  No, I don’t have a contingency in place in case an 8-foot half-man half-Godzilla creature decides the product is too small for him/her to use.   You paranoid pessimistic bitch.

      Drunk grrrls who act a fool and say (type) stupid things...... definately deserve a beatdown.   "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy."  "I may be drunk but at least I'm not insane."  "I don't have a drinking problem 'Cept when I can't get a drink."  "There ain't no devil, there's just god when he's drunk"  "Well, the first rule is not to try to drink with him. (When asked about what it was like to write with Keith Richards)."  "Pour me a cab, I just can't drink no more."  "The piano has been drinking, not me."  "Oh yeah, I remember my first beer." (to a waitress dropping a tray of drinks)  "the drinks are free and everything...but they hit you up at the door on the way out..."  "I thought I heard a saxophone, I'm drunk on the moon"  "I've got a bottle for a trumpet, a hatbox for a drum..."  "I sold a quart of blood and bought a half a pint of scotch"  "And I'm standing on the corner of Fifth and Vermouth...using parking meters as walking sticks."  -Tom Waits

      1. Customers who ask you a question about what they want to buy and then answer their CELL PHONE in the middle of your answer.  2. Women who come into your store and say, "I'd like to try on everything you have in size 12. I'll meet you in the dressing room."  3. People who return clothing that they have clearly worn to an event. It smells like sweat, the tag is taped to the inside of the sleeve and they are soulless asshats.  4. People who don't understand that hitting on a person who has NO OTHER CHOICE than to be nice to you is abominable. Don't you get it? You can be a complete pig, but if I'm on commission I still have to kiss your ass. And even if I'm not, I still have to be polite or risk getting fired.  You all deserve a beatdown with overpriced leather luggage and power suits still on the hanger!!

      First I must admit, being single again after a three-year relationship feels extremely liberating.  At 30 something, I feel empowered, in control, the captain of my ship, master of my destiny (okay I don’t feel this way all the time but Im practicing the power of positive thinking).  Why you may wonder did my 3 year relationship end?  Because I chose it too, for reasons those include; 1. He was too short for me 2. He made comments about my weight 3. He didn’t respect any of my accomplishments as an activist or scholastically 4. His kid was a total brat and I couldn’t see myself step parenting for the next 10 years a child I could not stand to be around 5. He was a total queeny, drama queen 6. He criticized me too much 7. He tried to control me 8. It just wasn’t workin for me….   So Im single again, a 30 something single (can we get the cheezy theme song playing from the show thritysomething?).  As of now, I really like being single.  I figure, my son is 14, too old for any man to step in his life and play daddy, and old enough where I cant date and not be harassed.  I remind him that what comes around goes around and I will get him back now that he is dating too.  A woman in her 30s knows who she is sexually, is independent, confident in themselves, and oh yes, much more mature.    One of my very close friends is also a single momma, single thritysomething.  We go out together scouting out single men and basically keep each other morale up, and ward off losers.  We like to think of our lives as parallel to the gals on “Sex in the City” despite the fact we live in redneckville sailor town, and those women live in glamorous Manhattan.   While out with her dancing, I met my current boy toy (23).  Believe it or not, this is my first sailor fling, and I am having a good time hanging out with him.  It is an ego boost, but definitely not something I would call a real relationship.  He is young and needs to sew his wild oats so to speak, and plus he is a sailor, and sailors leave.  (a good and bad thing).  So considering my new status as single, I decided to try the cheezy single thing called “Online dating” or Personals.  More for a joke for myself, but also just to give it a whirl, what the heck.  You can post for free, you have to pay to make contact.  Believe me Im not paying a dime for this crap, but I thought it would be fun all the same.   Here is a link to what I posted on the dating site.    urlLink My Online Personal Add    Here is a lovely sampling of some of the guys who have responded.  Just my luck eh?  Gets me all bothered....NOT!   urlLink Date Prospect 1    urlLink Date Prospect 2    urlLink Date Prospect 3   The following guy sent a note that said: Are you related to Demi Moore? Anyhow I read your profile and liked what I read. You can check out mine and write back if interested. Hope to hear back from you.   *I dont think he is not soooo bad just a little short for me.    urlLink Date Prospect 4    urlLink Date Prospect 5   -----Now you guys see why I am still single.  LOL.

      We get out of the jeep, adjust our lipstick, and adjust our hair.  Maybe if we get lucky we can dance the night away with some prince charming who happens to be in this town at this club (fat chance).  At best we can hope for cheap drinks, faces cuter with beer goggles on, and cheap slutty sex with some squid.  Ah the possibilities.  Wait, rewind, lets back up ½ to the local tavern, I havent finished with the full on description yet….  Let me tell you some more about the local tavern we were previously at.   We share the barstools, with the bar stool regulars, a motley assortment of townies some resembling Norm from Cheers others resembling your local computer geek.  Sailors never sit at the bar, these seats are strictly reserved for the townies.  The bar is decorated with various mirrors, local artists gloomy artwork, beer cans from foreign lands, and music posters.  On the other side of the bar is two pool tables, always taken by sailors who keep to that side of the bar.  There is a band warming up on stage, a local band, whose members appear in their 30s and don tattoos, thick glasses, and Ramoans style hair cuts.  Kathleen complains that when the band plays its too loud to talk.  I actually like local bands, and notice one of the musicians to be an old friend of mine.  I run up and give him a hug.  I think to myself, finally someone cool here to talk too.  “Your going to watch us play” he asks, I nod, and hope to myself we aren’t headed dancing once the live music begins.    Okay, now cut to back at the dance club, we walk to the guy checkin Ids, Im embarrassed to see that he recognizes me with a wink and doesn’t need to see my ID.  Now I feel like a regular…. I could die a thousand deaths….  The DJ is blasting 50 cent and so far the dance floor is empty except for one drunk older lady sporting glowing rave toys.  The bar is dark, girls with tight tee shirts scramble to keep up with drink orders at the bar.  Navy memorabilia line the walls, pictures of squids, plaques with squid awards, ship photos, sub mariner relics.  Ah a safe haven for sailors.... oie wey.  As we walk in, its like the music comes to a screetching stop and all eyes are on us.  The sailors gaze at us between puff of their cigarettes.  The local girls snicker and glare, upset by more competition.  Kathleen recognizes a table full of townies and drops her purse on the table, staking a claim.  I follow cautiously.  Im wishing for a big joint at this point.  Ah yes, it would be great to be stoned now.  The big biker at the table greets Kathleen with a hug, I see he is wearing colors for the Banditos biker gang.   Kathleen scans the scene, “its dead here” she says.  I realize for club time its still early, only 10:00.  “Im sure it will pick up" I say. "Hes cute" Kathleen gasps, while nonchelantly pointing at some guy bending over the pool table in tight wrangler jeans "nice ass".  "Wrangler butts drive me nuts" I reply wryly.     “Lets Dance” Kathleen says as a new song starts, its “Its raining Men” by the Weathergirls.  Though not drunk enough to really cut lose, I oblige thinking what they heck.  Its always fun to make a fool of yourself.  Plus, like Booger says in Risky Business “Sometimes you gotta say what the Fuck, if you cant say it, you cant do it!" ---Will continue the adventures in redneck land in another post....  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      The town where I was born, grew up, escaped, and now reside could be described as a logging, rednecked, sailor town full of testosterone, kegs, gun stores, and churches.  Men drive pick up trucks with mud flaps and gun racks and sport mullets with pride.  Because it’s a navy town, men outnumber women 5 to 1.  The women could be described as typically overweight, hungry for sailor blood and sport aqua net big hair styles that would make David Lee Roth jealous.   The sailors (squids) always travel in packs and can be recognized both by their numbers and short haircuts with baseball hats.  The theme of “townies vs. sailors” seems all too prevalent at any public establishment, hence resulting in the occasional bar fight.    A typical night on the town..  Kathleen picks me up in her jeep, cigarette dangling from her lips, loud Duran Duran “Hungry like a wolf” emanating from the stereo, her dressed to the nines tight black pants, open toe sandals with heels, and a low cut tight fitting shirt.  She tells me she made arrangements to have her son spend the night at his grandmas, so her house is available for an after hours party.  (Remember we all are single mothers here).  We drive away singing away with the CD player, occasionally letting out a sarcastic “OW” to a camero full of squids. “Where do you want to go?” She asks I give my usual response “Where is there to go” (besides crazy like Patsy Cline I think to myself) “Lets pop off to the tavern for a couple drinks and see how we feel”  I agree.   We arrive at the local tavern and Kathleen makes a beeline for a seat at the bar.  She knows all the bar stool regulars, plus the bartenders.  She greets many of them with hugs, while I merely wave and smile (I don’t know them very well).  Bad Companys “Feel like making love” plays on the jukebox.  I recognize one of the guys sitting at the bar from high school, though he has gained some weight.  Both Kathleen and I light up cigarettes and order vodka cranberrys (double).  We talk bar talk (sports, Survivor) until Kathleen tells one of the barstool regulars that I work at a library.  Suddenly, conversation shifts to me “Oh you look like a librarian” someone says (I wear glasses).  Another tries to impress me with his knowledge of books.   I order another drink, and a shot, and consider calling up friends on my cell phone.   After an hour or so, Kathleen gets restless…. Doing her best impression of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever she says “I want to dance”.  I know what is coming next, she wants to go to the local meat market, squid infested dance club.  Im happy here, I try to say, though I know my words are futile.  We get back in the jeep and head out to the dance club.

             I am  Pacman .   I am an aggressive sort of personality, out to get what I can, when I can. I prefer to avoid confrontation, but sometimes when it's called for, I can be a powerful character. I tend to be afflicted with munchies constantly.

      My brother just returned from Iraq.  He is a captain in the army and a blackhawk pilot.  Every day he was over there I would watch the news for headlines of those fallen, and pray that it wasn’t him.  I smoked a lot of cigarettes and spent a lot of time fretting.  He came back recently, and talks of missions and sitting in on interrogations etc.  He is really upset about the prison abuse scandal, and what that is doing to the reputation of the Army.  Im not a fan of war, I must say, but I totally support our troops over there.  My heart goes out to them and there families every day.    Here is a link to the faces of the fallen from this Iraq war.  Our hearts go out to you heros!   urlLink Fallen   Here is CNNs info  urlLink CNNFalen     Online I met a soldier who is currentlly in Iraq.  We chat through yahoo occasionaly, I guess he has access to a computer ($20 hour).  He sent me a poem he wrote on war, that I will post here without permission.  He is another hero, serving his country, doing his job, in a war many of us don’t believe in.    this is a very condensed version of the time the night went calm. i would have to work on it for a while to get it all written again. it is about 5 pages long and it bounces around a lot so I will do the best i can with a short version of it. and it is not perfect either. I have forgotten quite a bit of it so I am just writing to the bast of my memory. I dont think it sounds as good as it used to but at least you have an idea on what it is. i have the original at home. when I get there I will type it out and send it to you if you want.  There was a time the night went calm, it was then i knew, something’s wrong gazing up, into the sky, a fiery light, passing by, suddenly, a boom, a bang. There was sudden killing, sudden pain, many murders, all in vain. there was war, on our fair shores,  soldiers rushing through all doors. there was sudden killing, sudden pain, many murders, all in vain. I could see, the whites of their eyes, enemy soldiers, passing by. i sit screaming, agony, pain, will these soldiers come back again? our young soldiers, come out to fight, come out to fight , this cool dark night. for our brave soldiers, it was the test, they fought and died, they did their best. through the night, all the same, all the murders, all in vain. the night is over, all is done, the killings over, the pain is gone, all were slain, all but one. alone i sit, in anguish and pain, all around me have been slain, all the murder, all in vain. a year has passed now, all is done, the killings over, the pain is gone. and i look back and see the wrong, thinking of the time the night went calm.

       urlLink Blogarama    What a Morning   I didn’t want to wake up this morning as usual, hit the snooze button too many times.  Today was also a bad hair day, its raining outside, and everything felt blah.  I should have planned my outfit last night, instead of scrambling through clothes this morning.  I didn’t want to wear the same tired ol corduroys with the velvety shirt so I decided to try on some dresses I haven’t worn in a year or so.  Big mistake.  The first dress I barely got over my shoulders, it was now way too tight (a size 10), the next dress (a size 11) I was able to get on, but the arms were so tight I felt like I would have bruises.  I could barely get the dress off without calling my son for help (I would have died from embarrassment), the next dress was a button up, so I figured I could step into it and get it to work.  Fat chance (no pun intended) I couldn’t get the buttons to close in the front (my breasts have gotten bigger, no complaint there).  So I ended up late, in a huff, and having to wear the stupid corduroy pants.  Not a good way to start your morning.    The neighbors downstairs   Every couple of nights (sometimes every night) I hear a woman screaming.  This has woken me from my sleep, or caused me to want to hurl and not be able to go to sleep.  At first you think there is a problem, they you realize the woman is SCREAMING in some redneck style ecstasy.  Come on lady you live in an apartment, do you have to SREAM during sex?  Its one thing to make noise, Im sure I wouldn’t hear them if they were just making noise, but NO, this heavy set navy wife SCREAMS like a dying COW.  It is terribly disturbing to say the least.  I have wanted to do the rude neighbor thing and pound on the walls, but I have stopped myself.  I think I may call the apartment manager and complain today.  Not that I am prude, I just think screaming at the top of your lungs is a little inappropriate for the wee hours of the night, regardless if it is pleasure screams or not.  (SIGH)

      Okay so I have to tell a funny story that happened the other day.  First let me explain, I have two best friends here at my corporate America job, both smokers, both married.  Yes, this has circulated rumors amongst the hens in the henhouse, but hey who cares about the bettys anyway.  So the other day, I went for a drive and a cigarette break/coffee run with one of these friends.  We were smoking, and laughing and joking around before getting coffee at the Albertsons Starbucks.  I was saying in my poor broken accent “Que es el invasor… Gringo?” Basically quoting a poster I saw in San Diego which translates “Who is the invader – Whitey”.  My friend laughs and says, “boy you sound white when you say that” then, he being from San Diego and growing up in the Barrio says in a loud, full on Vatos accent “Que es el innvasor… GRINGA?!” (heavy accent on Gringa).  Well I look over in the parking lot, and there is this guy with a full on mullet stopping poofing out his chest, and giving my friend a stand down.  They guy looked like he could be straight out of Leanard Skinard.  Full on mullet, acid washed jeans, and a muscle shirt.  He gave my friend the stand down for about 2 minutes, until he saw me laughing and realized he had just made himself a fool.  Its just funny to me that mullet chivalry exists, and I also laughed that my friend almost got his butt kicked by a redneck for calling me a Gringa.  Can I get the theme music from Dueling Banjos here?      urlLink ">Link

      From the Work Desk of Vadergrrrrl  What is it like to work for corporate America?  How many of us sit from our computers and surf the web while at work?  How many of us hate our jobs, wish for something more, get paid peanuts, and live by the daily mantra “life is not fair”? Well hells bells join the friggin club.  My job is no picnic, though I do get to sit at a keyboard all day and secretly surf the web.    Its funny all the characters you will meet on the job.  Wherever the job, there are always the same cast of characters (the names change however).   Here is a current cast of characters that I work with (names will be changed to avoid lawsuits)  Gina- the company kiss ass.  Dress code very low cut shirts, tight pants.  Typically found bending over the boss’s desk giggling.  Despite lack of brain cells, “works” her way into lucrative management position.  Conversation with her always involve her spreading the newest rumor about herself “did you hear the new one, I gave the boss a blow job in the parking lot”.    Betsy –executive assistant, mother hen and office busy body.  This one always rubs me the wrong way, she is in everyone’s business spreading rumors and telling on people to HR.  Considers herself an “executive” even though she is still a secretary.  Will take 2 hour lunches daily, and then tell on you to your supervisor if you are 10 mins late coming back from yours.   This woman makes my life HELL.  Dan – the lab geek, computer nerd.  Tall, lanky, with glasses, and Izod polo shirts.  Looks like he should wear a pen protector, but states he is a little to hip for that extremity.  Loves Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, and playing computer games from work when no one is looking.  Eats PB&J sandwiches for lunch everyday.  This guy is fun to goof around with, but is in somewhat fear and curiosity by your tattoos and/or piercing.   Paul – the nutty professor.  Hair reminiscent of Albert Einstein, he does wear a pocket protector, glasses, and a plaid short sleeve shirt.  Has a PhD but still is paid a college student salary.  He seems lost in the world of knowledge, his dialect sometimes hard to ascertain.  Social skills definitely need improvement, but if you take the time to talk to him, he is quite an interesting person.  The big shocker…. He is actually married.   Lanna – the permanent office help.  Yes she always worked here, and she will remind you of that daily.  She housesits for the big boss, knows his family well, and has one of those jobs with no real title or definition of duties.  She is heavy set, but loves to eat (you will find her snacking throughout the day), and she is also allowed to play solitaire from her computer desk.  She is also a busybody gossip that hangs with the executive assistant and watches your every step with a judgmental glare.    Lisa – the overqualified receptionist.  Lisa has a PhD in Music and sings opera on the side.  She handles herself with grace and finesse, though she is way to overqualified and underpaid to be a receptionist.  She gives credence to the fact that one should never get a degree in the arts.    Larry – Butt Kissing Brown Noser.  This guy was recently promoted to supervisor.  He is a snidely little fellow, only 22, who has cultivated the art of ass kissing.  You will always find him walking behind the boss, whispering names of fellow employees who have said something out of line, and should be on the “shit list”.  Backstabbing, conniving, this guy can not be trusted.  Before he was supervisor, I saw him snorting lines at a party, once promoted he stopped going to company “parties” for the reason “I don’t want to see anything I shouldn’t”.  Im sure he has incriminated many in his rise to power.   This is all I have for now.  Will add more characters later.  Do you recognize anybody?  They are everywhere……       urlLink ">Link

      One thing about flings with boy toys…. They are not always the best about calling.  You would think after being discipled by a Goddess like me, he would be calling me every day, wagging his tale with his tongue sticking out.  Not this player…. I think he might date by the gospel of the movie Swingers, and have each move he makes be “Money”.   Im not into the “RULZ” of dating.  Who cares about that shit anyway.  Lets get together, make whoopee, have fun, and ah yes, I can teach you things you have only dreamed of.     So I call him on Sunday, just cuz I was winding down for the night with a glass of Merlot and a cigarette, and I felt like talking on the phone.  Well I guess in the 23 year old world, or dating mores, girls should wait for boys to call them.  I think as the older woman here I can be the aggressor.  Sailor boy-toy response was he was happy to hear from me, he was tired from working and oh yeah, he was about to take a shower and was all  nekid  when I called (so he had to cut it short).  Well gee, wouldn’t you think being  nekid  would be the perfect opportunity to talk to a sex pot like me?  I mean realllllllly!  Then he pulled the old “I will call you tomorrow” routine.  Blech….. Phoey!  The thing is the Seamen never called me the next day.  Little punk, why I’ll show you.  Im sure he was off being 23, doing things 23 year old do, as he should be.  Im sure he will call when he gets horny for his older woman lover and wants to “connect”.  Part of me wants to blow him off (not literally) for a while, and the other part of me says what the fuck, he is just a fun fling (spring fling) and why take it that seriously.  Enoy the ride.  We shall see where this torrid affair goes.  Im just pissy because, damnit I want the power and control here.         urlLink ">Link

      Gas prices today, who can afford to drive?  Or commute for that matter.  Sheesh!  I have to drive 45 minutes one way to get to work each morning, where I sit at a desk and make $13 an hour.  I have a college degree from Berkeley and have tried to find a job making more money.  It seems like companies hire good paying jobs part time first, or as temporary positions.  I applied for a job at the junior college here, and was called back and told; though I was a top candidate I didn’t get the job because they hired internally.  They recommended that I start as a temporary, and that is how I get my "foot in the door".  Well, as a single mother of a 14-year-old, how would I be able to support myself with a part time job, or with a temporary position?  Im not some Stepford wife who has the luxury of accepting these kind of positions for spare change for shopping.  I actually have to pay rent, bill, groceries, GAS, etc out of my earnings.  Im so tired of being part of the working poor.  This glass ceiling is closing me into the Bell Jar!   The cover of Business Week features a woman, looking haggard and tired in professional clothing with the headline "Americas Working Poor".  I read the article; it just made me depressed. At least I have health insurance.  I didn’t for years in my twenties.  My teeth rotted out, and I lost a bunch in the back.  This is really a disgrace here.  Minimum wage is what 7.50?  Who can live off that?  How is that determined?  Where would you live?  Couch surf?  Or is that a minimum wage for a high school senior living with the Brady Bunch family?!?!  Im tired of having to work 3 jobs, and still beg for my child support payments, and live off credit cards each week.  I would like to earn what I think I deserve, I worked hard at college, graduated top of my class.  Maybe I need to read the Bell Jar again and get more depressed.  What is life for a smart, educated female?  Trapping a husband to support you?  Being a secretary to some asshole who will sexually harass you?    BIG RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

      I saw Fast Times at Ridgemont High for the 100th or so time this weekend.  I love the movie, especially the shots of Nicolas Cage flipping burgers, but must admit I cringe every time a certain character comes around.  Ron Johnson, stereo salesman.  I hate how he asks for Jennifer Jason Leighs phone number, and I especially hate when he takes her out on their first date.  What a pig.  He picks her up in his fancy car, with his fancy leather jacket, and asks her what she wants to do.  She has no response, and he suggests "how about the point"?  The Point consists of some graphitti infested baseball dugout, totally visible to onlookers.  He grabs a blanket, takes her to the point, exchanges two words with her "its warm" and "are you really 19", then imediately asks if he is going to "get to first base".  What a slime ball.  What kind of first date is this?  No dinner, no movies, no moves whatsover.  Only a innocent virgin would fall for this, and Im sure Ron Johnson know this, and has done this before.  I hate to see Jennifer Jason Leigh's character lose her virginity this way!  This part of the movie is all to real.  So many young girls fall prey to these Ron Johnson types.  I guess many of these young virgin's take some responsibility, since they want to "get it over with".  But I hate these slimeball older guys who steal girls virginity, with nothing more than a date to the Point.  Blech.  I had my own Ron Johnson when I was a 17 year old virgin.  No date, no movies, just got me drunk at a friends house and took my innocence.  I dont hate him, never did.  But I just find these Ron Johnson types hard to swallow.

      Well... after all that waiting for young boy toy to call, he did!  Friday after work, he calls wanting to do something.  Of course, myself at 34, and not in to playing games, called him right back and made plans.  We went out to a local bar, sang Kareoke (sp) - He sang "I think I love you" by the Partridge Family, and I sang "Crazy" by Patsy Kline.  Fitting eh?  We then went dancing, and had a great time.   My friend is upset with this relationship, and thinks I will get attached.  My reply, with a 23 year old?  I dont think so.  Im just getting my groove back here.  He is so fun to hang out with, and mentor (wink, wink), and I hope to see him for a while.  But I know there is no future here for anything serious.  But who wants serious anyway?  Must run now.  Post more later.

      Dating games...  Whoever in the hell started playing these sadistic games should be shot and killed. (well not shot and killed, but maybe tortured). (Sigh) Im just getting out of a 3 year relationship.  Im not used to these games here.  I call it like I see it, I say what I mean.  I hated being controlled in the 3 year relationship.  I also started feeling used for sex.  Not that I dont *LOVE* sex, but I want to have it when I want it, I dont want to be pressured or shamed into having it.  It just got old, and weird, so I broke it off.   Now comes the dating games part.  Ive kinda done the "Im out of a long term relationship so lets go hog wild thang", which, I dont know is too healthy or safe.  I have this wild friend who considers sailors "disposable sex toys" and considers Samantha from Sex in the City to be her mentor.  We have been hanging out and I have been kinda doing the free love liberated punk rock chick thing.  Ive had some fun, but it also has kinda sucked.  Thought nothing would make me miss my ex, but, this club scene dating has.   I meet this cute young boy (23 sailor), who is 10 years younger than I dancing at a club.  We kiss and exchange numbers.  He calls a couple days later, I call him back, we talk about getting together.  We get together a couple of times, have sex (I know should have waited, but again Im doing the liberated woman thang) and bam, the guy doesnt call me for 5 days.  I thought the sex was pretty good too, and I made it clear I didnt want a relationship, so I dont think I scared him off by pressuring him.  So now, Im sitting here waiting by the phone, for some young ass boy to call me.  Im too old for this shit, is the first thing that comes to my mind.  But my ego does not appreciate getting the brush off.  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.  How DARE he, doesnt he know who I am (LOL). I hate waiting for the phone to ring, I forgot this part of dating games.  I was so used to being in a relationship and calling whenever the fuck you feel like it. Ive read that its okay for guys to wait DAYS before they call you back, but every girl I talk to thinks thats rude.  The sad thing is I still want to see him, and rock his young ass world some more.  Oh well... the pleasures of dating.

             I got a feeling that behind those jeans is something wonderful just waiting to get out." –Jack Horner    Today I discovered I share a birthday with a famous star, Porn star that is.  March 12 is not only MY birthday, but its also the birthday of the Hedgehog or better known as Ron Jeremy.  I could not believe I have never discovered this until today, I knew about Ricky Shroder and Lawrence Welk, but never this icon who has done so much to revolutionize sexuality in America.  I must say that I am honored.  March 12, the day porn star champions are made!      Mucho gusto me llamo Bradley I'm hornier than Ron Jeremy and if you wanna get popped in your knee just wipe that look off your fat face you hate me cause I got what you need You hate me cause I got what you need, A pretty little daughter that we call mixie, and, If you wanna get beat physically It will be over in a minute if ya  So she told me to come over and I took that trip And then then she pulled out my mushroom tip And when it came out, it went drip drip drip I didnt know she had the g.i. joe, kung foo grip  And it went - uhh And the girl caress me down- uhh And thats that lovin sound- it went uhh And the girl caress me down- uhh And thats that lovin sound  When I kiss mixie she makes me feel horny, Cause I’m the type of lover with the sensitivity, When she kiss my neck and tickle me frenzy, The right kind of lover on sunday morning   - Sublime Carress me Down    Amber Waves: Let me just check on something. [Takes off Dirk's pants.] That is a giant cock .   Ron's reply to Bradley   "I don’t think I'm much hornier than the average guy," says the man who fucks for a living. In his broad, Jewish-New-Yorker accent, Ron Jeremy continues with the matter-of-fact pragmatism of an accountant, "People often think you must be. But I don't know, you have to have a certain amount of concentration to do it on camera."       *he is a star wars fan too… here he is with Carrie Fisher and the actor who played Chewbacca!   Floyd Gondolli: I like simple pleasures, like butter in my ass, lollipops in my mouth. That's just me. That's just something that I enjoy.      They call him Hedgehog. Short, hairy and pleasantly plump, he's been in over 1,750 pornographic films, as well as mainstream movies, including Detroit Rock City and Orgazmo. He's appeared in 14 music videos from Moby's to Ice T's. Charted his own music for 27 weeks on Billboard. Directed over 300 films and has even done stand-up comedy. He's lectured at California State's Fullerton campus and at UCLA on sex and the law.       - Ron Jeremy stats Full Name: Ron Jeremy Occupation: Porn Star  Name: Ron Jeremy Birthday: March 12, 1953 Birthplace: New York      Oooh yes... Do me Ronnie?!?!?!?  I confess not attracted to Ron Jeremy, but I LOVE watching him in adult film.  And like Tony Soprano, there is something about Ronnie that makes him strangely appealing.   Why?, because he makes me laugh, and every porn scene he appears in is fun.  I currently own two pornos with Ron Jeremy, and I love watching his scenes.  In one porn, he plays the slimy porn boss who is auditioning a new “star”.  In the other, he plays himself Ron Jeremy, it’s a Debby Does Dallas movie (the 3rd) and he cameos as himself and even shoots a hairy ass scene.  Its like train wreck porn, he grosses you out with his hairy ass and fat body, and makes you laugh at the same time.  His expressions during his cum shots are always classic.  Close up on his face, and he gets all scrunched up and intense!  LOL.  He delivers his lines with sleaziness and style of a pornstar champion.  Im always impressed at his acting, he actually is good, and I suppose what is the best acting is how he scores so many chicks!  Ron has been with everyone, from Nina Hartley to Kendra Jade.     I think I was the average looking guy that guys could relate to. If you get a real good-looking guy, it's hard to get so far because the audience does not relate.     Vibrating Ron Jeremy Penis.... Ewwwww!  I found on the internet that you can actually buy a vibrating penis molded after Ron Jeremy, though I don’t know if that thought excites or disgusts me.  A vibrating replica of the body part that made Ron Jeremy famous.   Quotes from the Jedi Master  What is your favorite position?   Any one where the girl screams "yes!" When you have sex, is it a chore or...   Oh I still love it.   Q: Good to know, how about sex toys, anything you like or use?   Yes, my own mold, the Ron Jeremy mold, so I can double penetrate a girl and both are mine    Sex Tips from the Hedgehog  " To quote my old friend the comedian, the late, great Sam Kennison, 'lick the alphabet'. Sam would say, if he learned give really good head, he wouldn't have to give away everything he owns every five years. The trick is to give a girl really good head, and give her a good orgasm before she even sees what your penis looks like. Keep the mystery going."    Would Ron do a male/male love scene?   Men "I won't do men. Only because once you a guy's hairy behind, you don't feel like sticking anything in it. I wanna give him a shave. And I don't have to worry about it, because I've seen my rear end on a wide screen and no self-respecting homosexual would want to do me."   Jeremy interview links  urlLink Link 1   urlLink Link 2     What Ronnie considers Quality Stuff?    I like the old-fashioned stuff with a plot and a story line since I'm coming from the actor's point of view. Some people say, "Why?" Well, I like a setup, a buildup, a tease. I still come from the old-school attitude where you want to see a tease before you see the girl get naked. Let's see some dialogue and get into character. I don't want, here's a cup of coffee... eat me!      Like Dirk Diggler.. Ron does Karate!   Ron the Funny Man:     I think porn films need that, but was told to stop making jokes after the nookie started. I was criticized by one of the filmmakers, who told me that guys can't laugh and have a boner at the same time. I never thought about it, but I had to agree with him    I Rented a Ron Movie from Hollywood Video  I saw the documentary Porn Star: the legend of Ron Jeremy, which I actually found at Hollywood Video.  I LOVED the movie, it was a great documentary, that totally captured Ron’s personality, while also featuring some of his classic lines and adult scenes.     Ron describes the movie   It's about my life, from childhood on. Shows me getting into the teaching profession, my family being all war veterans. People are shocked that I was a former schoolteacher. It's a little slice of life, it puts a friendly face on the world of porn; no drugs, no alcohol, no abuse, just a guy, college-educated, who wanted to make a porno film, and ended up being in the porn business. People will find it interesting hopefully   urlLink  Ron Jeremy-the movie link   "Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy" is the new, critically acclaimed feature film that explores the life of the world’s most unlikely sex star, Ron Jeremy.  The Daily Herald said of the film: "look beyond the temptation of doing nasty, intimate acts with drop-dead-gorgeous women. You'll see a hidden portrait of a man who spends his life in desperate perpetual motion, afraid to stop, and always stuffing the voids in the heart with superficial affections from complete strangers called the public...   Here is a link to Ron’s official webiste, if you want to see some great photos!    urlLink Ron Jeremy Site     Welcome to the Jungle…. Baby!   Ron Jeremy Biography  I found this on the web... enjoy!  A  pudgy but lovable wacko who has become one of porn's most prolific male stars through sheer perseverance, Ron Jeremy is one of the best-known porn studs of all time. He's a mustachioed and portly guy whose fun-loving nature comes through in every leering glance, a man who is affectionately known as "The Hedgehog" due to the amount of hair on his back. Ron Jeremy is certainly not the best-looking guy to ever sex for the cameras, but his dogged persistence and reliable tool have kept him busy for over twenty years.  Ron graduated in the Cardoza (Brooklyn) High Class of 1971 and attained a master's degree from Queens College. He was working as a high school special education teacher in New York City by the mid-1970's. In 1978, Ron's girlfriend sent a photo of him in to "Playgirl" magazine for inclusion in its 'Boy Next Door' section. The publishers knew a good thing then they saw it, and Ron's photo was duly published. He ended up getting not only lots of letters from female admirers, but also from some hardcore producers from the area. Ron was quite the ham even then and enjoyed moonlighting in off-Broadway theater. The burgeoning porn industry was just starting to take off in New York, and Ron leapt at the offers he received. He made his hardcore debut in 1979's "Tigresses. . .And Other Man-Eaters," taking on Samantha Fox in his very first on-screen encounter. He ended up dropping his teaching gig and pursuing porno stardom full time. Ron soon became one of the busiest guys in porn.  Ron is the first to admit that he's not the best looking guy in the industry, but he feels that his average-Joe looks have actually helped him to sustain his popularity. "People can relate," he says. "When you see a gorgeous guy getting all the girls, the audience goes 'So what?' You see a schlub like me get lucky and it's like there's hope for everybody else."  Ron has also moved behind the camera and branched out, becoming one of porn's most well-known ambassadors to the mainstream media. He's appeared on tons of talk shows (including numerous stints on "Jerry Springer") and serves as a frequent consultant on 'legit' projects like "Boogie Nights," "9 1/2 Weeks" and the acclaimed documentary "Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam." Always eager to branch into the mainstream, Ron has also had bit parts in such Hollywood features as "Killing Zoe" and "Detroit Rock City."   Ron spends any spare time he has performing at comedy clubs from coast to coast, spreading his special brand of off-color glee. He remains one of the busiest men in the industry, a true original who has always done things his way.    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

        In my teens I idolized Marilyn Monroe, she was sexy, sultry, and oh so beautiful.  Marilyn was my dream grrrl, until my early 20’s when upon my sexual liberation I first became expose to Bettie Page.  Unconsciously, almost as if fate had intervened, by my early 20’s I started to cultivate the Bettie Page look.  This was before I even was aware of who she was.  I prefered to keep my hair dark, with short bangs, I preferred 50’s style clothing, and I was especially was into sporting anything leopard print… bras, panties, furniture, purses, shoes…Everything.  Once I became aware of Bettie I felt a soul connection, as if my spiritual sister had paved the way for my sexual and personal identity.      Bettie the Bondage Babe  Bettie was also very naughty, her highly publicized “bondage” photos still leave a legacy of both fetish and intrigue.  From what we saw in the photos, Bettie liked to be spanked with a hairbrush, spank other grrrls, be tied up, gagged, and emulate the persona of a Dominatrix Diva.  Bettie made this look oh so exciting, and I couldn’t wait to emulate her in every way.  To this day, one of my dreams has been to do a black and white photo shoot in homage to Bettie’s bondage shots.  Im still waiting to find the “right” photographer to complete this goal.  LOL      Dominatrix Divas!  I started getting into bondage and fetish in my early 20's.  This culminated when I moved to the Bay Area, and would attend fetish shows and Sexstacy balls (Featuring bands such as Lords of Acid and Thrill Kill Kult).  At these events, a bunch of us grrrls would dress to the nines in full on bondage gear and then go out and paint the town red.  For my look, I would usually sport fishnet tights held up by an exposed garter belt, a short vinyl mini skirt, black bra, see through top, and accessorize with spiked cuffs, spiked collar, handcuffs, a whip, and a big leather cock ring worn on my arm as a bracelet.  Being that I am about 6 feet tall, I would always play the Dom.  My grrrlfriend, who was a petite brunette, would be my slave, dressing in a shear see-through dress, with black bra and panties exposed, a big dog collar with a leash…of which I of course had the reigns!   We would parade around, and I would spank her and we would kiss, and fondle each other, and act all wild and and oh so crazy.  We especially liked to "go wild" AFTER the fetish show, out on the town, where we could shock the locals.  Granted it was San Francisco, but we still got some shocked and surprised looks from passerby’s.  This was all for fun and show, but none of these theatrics really made it into the bedroom. I do have a bunch of great photos from these adventures that if I am able to scan one day, I will share.           Peak inside Vadergrrrl’s playpen  Sexually my bondage experience seem to keep me in the position of slave grrrl. I have been blindfolded and tied up numerous times during sex.(very fun especially with silk sheets, candlewax, and other naughty bedroom toys) I have also been handcuffed, or forcibly restrained.  I love to be spanked, bitten, have my hair pulled and be roughed with.  It seems however, that my being female, most men I have been with insist on being the Dom, and my being the slave.  Most men like to spank, but don’t want to be on the receiving end.  Believe me, I try to get them to bend over my knee, and use a hairbrush on their ass, but they just wont let me do that for long.  They would wrather, it seems, do that to me.  Like the freak I am, I of course LOVE IT!  I have tied a man up and given him oral, or gotten on top, and they do seem to like it when they can just lay there and I do all the work.  It seems when it comes to bondage, I am the slave…. Not the Dom.  Though I like to play one on TV... LOL.         Thank you Bettie!  Thank you Bettie for teaching me how to be sexy, liberated, naughty, and a dark haired diva. We will probably never know, what really happened to Bondage Queen Bettie, but we will love and cherish her Goddess image for a lifetime… Xoxoxoxo love you Bettie!  Below is an short article on Bettie, and then some bondage sex tips...   urlLink Photos from this site    Excerpt from article on Bettie   urlLink Bettie link    Black Bangs, Bikinis and Bondage  Desiree Krauss    The legendary Bettie (her preferred spelling) Page has a huge cult following, and with good reason; she is simply the queen of pin-up girls. The voluptuous, dark haired beauty with her trademark bangs captured a unique mix of naughty and nice in the 1950's that is still revered today by many fans. She may not be as publicly known as say, Marilyn Monroe or other starlets of that era, but it’s that dark edge that makes us love her. It has been estimated that over 20,000 photographs of Bettie have been taken – more than Madonna, Greta Garbo and Marilyn Monroe combined.  She was born in Nashville, April 22, 1923, the second of six children. Her family suffered from economic instability during the Depression and her parents encountered many problems; her father was abusive and womanizing. When her parents divorced, Bettie, at the age of 10, and her sisters were placed in an orphanage while her mother worked and saved money.  In high school, Bettie was a straight A student, active in school activities, such as the drama club, and didn't date very much. She was even voted "Most Likely to Succeed." She also learned to sew and would later make many of her own costumes. She fell a bit short of being class valedictorian and lost a scholarship to Vanderbilt University. After high school, she enrolled in the Peabody College for Teachers in Nashville. Billy Neal, her boyfriend, became her husband during her first year at Peabody, but he was drafted and sent off to War. She graduated in 1944 with a B.A. and moved to San Francisco to be closer to him. She got her start in modeling in San Francisco, posing in fur coats for a local furrier.  When the War was over, Bettie and Billy grew apart; she did quite a bit of traveling during this time to Miami, Nashville and Port au Prince. In November 1947, she filed for divorce. (She would marry again two more times!) Bettie Page moved to New York, where she met Jerry Tibbs. Jerry was a cop who dabbled in photography. He helped her put together her pin-up portfolio and suggested that she wear bangs to mask her high forehead, which would become her signature look.  Her modeling career took off; she began posing within camera clubs, where as many as sixty photographers would be snapping away. Her shots showed up in a variety of cheesecake magazines. She had no qualms about posing nude. Bettie preferred outdoor shoots; many of her infamous beach shots are by Bunny Yeager.  Bettie Page began working with brother and sister team Irving and Paula Klaw in 1951, posing for what were very controversial bondage photos in the conservative, "I Like Ike" days of America. Her uber-high heels, whips and other accoutrements of domination were ordered up by the customers who purchased the photos. Ms. Page laughed at some of the odd requests, yet was able to deliver these poses with a twinkle in her eye.  The success of these photos led to 8mm shorts such as Varietease and Teaserama. She made at least 50 of these infamous short stag films.  She was chosen as the centerfold in Playboy's January issue in 1955. The picture chosen was bought by the then-fledgling magazine from Bunny Yeager. Bettie was just shy of 32 years old at that time; ironic considering most models were considered “over-the-hill” at 25.  A huge controversy stirred over the Irving Klaw fetish films, and the U.S. government investigated Klaw as a pornographer. He was arrested for distribution of obscene material and it is estimated that 80% of his photos were burned.  Also around this time, it has been said that a pornographer placed Bettie’s head on another woman’s body. The only set of “nasty” photos may have been taken at a party where Bettie was drunk, but this was pushing it too far. Bettie spent much of her savings buying up these photographs.  Feeling burned out, she ended her modeling career at its peak in 1957. She left New York for Florida, and became a devout Christian in the late fifties. Today she lives privately with her family in California, never to be photographed again, but she is clearly etched in our memories as the bikini-clad, black banged girl.    BONDAGE TIPS 101   What would be a Vadergrrrl post with out some sex tips.  For those curious about bondage here are some tips.  Enjoy!     urlLink Bondage site    Bondage for beginners   Many people think about bondage but have no idea where to start. Here's TheSite's beginner guide to get you started safely. A simple definition of bondage is that it restricts someone's movement. Many people have tried a bit of "tie and tease", and found it to be an exciting way to spice up their love life.  The most important aspect of bondage games is trust, because one of the partners started safely. A simple definition of bondage is that it restricts someone's movement. Many people have tried a bit of "tie and tease", and found it to be an exciting way to spice up their love life.  The most important aspect of bondage games is trust, because one of the partners is restricted and therefore vulnerable. You must be able to trust one another completely; otherwise these kinds of games should never be played. The active partner (or 'top') should never use the session purely to fulfil their own fantasies in a selfish way, they should also think about the pleasure of the restrained partner ('passive partner' or 'bottom').   What's the attraction?   People are attracted to this type of play for a number of different reasons. Being tied up allows some people to relax and enjoy being given pleasure without having to worry about giving pleasure back to their partner at the same time. Others prefer to play-struggle against their restraints, and say it builds up an exciting adrenaline rush. Being blindfolded is supposed to heighten other sensations in the body. The person performing the bondage gets increased feelings of personal power, but of course this must never be abused.   First-time fun ideas   Some things that first-timers can try out include:  ·	Taking turns to tie each other up with silk scarves and tease one another.  ·	Tie the passive partner up with something that can easily be broken out of, such as paper streamers, or a really thin chain. Then they only have to stay in that position if they want to be there.  ·	Blindfolding during sex, massage, or kissing.  ·	Furry lovecuffs - handcuffs that are padded with fake fur on the inside to prevent chafing, and can't close too far (which cuts off the circulation). Before you go rushing off to the bedroom (or dungeon!), read our safety tips and reminders.   Safety tips   There are several safety issues to consider when playing bondage games, concerning consent, abuse, and physical injuries. If you don't feel safe with something then don't do it, there are hundreds of other things you can do instead.  ·	This is NOT something to try with someone you've just met. You really don't know whether they are trustworthy or not until you know them better, however charming they may seem at first.  ·	Never let a partner coerce or bully you into any sexual practice that you don't want to do. It's perfectly OK to say no, a decent lover will understand.  ·	Talk about it beforehand and discuss what you plan to do. Say what you will or will not allow. These rules and limits are sacred and must not be broken during the game.  ·	Have a safe word agreed before you begin. This is something that the passive partner can say if they want the other person to stop, a common safe word is 'enough'. The active partner must then stop what they are doing immediately, and release the passive partner within seconds.  ·	Never tie something around someone's neck unless it is a collar that's specially made for the purpose. There is a high risk of tissue damage, choking, or fatal strangulation. Similarly, gags are potentially dangerous.  ·	If someone is tied up, they must never be left alone. The active partner must make sure they are comfortable, breathing properly, and that nothing is cutting off their circulation.  ·	Do not try bondage in a remote place, just in case there is an accident that leaves the active partner injured and the passive partner tied up with no way of getting help.  ·	If you've never tried bondage before, don't go straight into anything that uses complicated equipment. This is for experts only and has extra safety issues that you may not understand.  ·	The rules of safer sex still apply. Use condoms for penetrative sex. Drink and drugs can cause you to seriously underestimate safety risks. Avoid intoxication    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

I was a virgin until my senior year in high school, when I met Ron Johnson the stereo sales men and he took me to “the point” to the music of “Somebody’s Babe” by Jackson Brown.  Well it really wasn’t Ron Johnson, but the story is pretty much the same.     Lets talk about boring!  Sex with my boyfriends and then husband (I married at 19) pretty much sucked.  Missionary style, or maybe doggie style, no orgasm, no real foreplay… just quick uneventful sex.  I wanted to think that I enjoyed it, but the reality of it was that it wasn’t all to great.  I was shy, a prude, and not really into it.  I didn’t even know what a female orgasm was until my early 20’s.     Porn....ewww gross!  I remember watching porn as a young girl and thinking….ewww gross.  These vampy women were overly sexed up and these hairy ass Ron Jeremys did nothing for me.  Porn seemed pretty gross, and anything but a turn on.     Nina Hartley changed my life  When I moved to the Bay Area in my early 20’s and started dating my boyfriend J, things changed, and I had a sexual blossoming so to speak.  J introduced me to porn, especially porn of Nina Hartley.  Nina opened a whole new world for me, and I would never be the same.   For those of you unfamiliar with Nina here is a little biography from her website.   urlLink Nina     She grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area of California with Jewish Communist parents. She started dancing naked in 1983 and started acting in porn in 1984. She graduated college with a degree in nursing in 1985. She has made about 575 adult movies. There are 12 episodes and counting in sex education videos on Adam & Eve. She has won numerous awards for her acting and activism. She speaks out on issues of feminism and sexuality and free statement as a sex speaker. Her sexuality is constantly evolving and changing as her understanding continues to grow.  This includes her knowledge on anal sex and her personal enjoyment of it.    Breakin the taboos!  Through watching her various videos and instructional tapes my sexuality was revolutionized.  I realized the power in being sexual, enjoying sex, and trying things once considered taboo.  For one, I had no idea how to give a good blow job, I thought you just sucked on the end and gagged a lot.  I learned how to nibble, tease, breathe through your nose, play with the base and balls, and oh yes, the joy in swallowing… I also learned how to enjoy having a guy go down on me.  First it helps I would say for a girl to be completely shaved.  J had me do this, and I have felt more liberated ever since.  It really does help, especially for oral sex.  But you really have to be comfortable telling a guy what feels good, and then, my god, don’t just lay there, get into it move around a little, shove his head into it…. LOL   Lets here it for anal play  The other form of sex I learned from Nina was how to enjoy anal sex.  J kept pressuring me to do this, and I thought it would be so dirty and nasty.  I learned from Nina that you can have a better orgasm that way, and with the right lube and stimulation, it can actually feel fabulous.     I am a serial monogomist btw  Another thing about sex that is important, a lot of this only works when you are in a committed  and comfortable relationship.  It takes a while to get to know someone’s body, and be comfortable.  I do not recommend getting this freaky and nasty with one night stands.  Shit who wants to use a condom when having this much fun.  Thanks Nina, darling teacher… and sex Goddess… Im a forever changed woman.    The following article kicks ass and can teach YOU ALL!  Here is an article with some great sexual education information that details one of Nina’s instructional videos.  This is actually a great piece that we can ALL learn something from.  (Jay I hope your reading this… LOL)   urlLink From this website    There is a very large misconception that anal sex is only enjoyed by gay men. As a result of this misconception, any heterosexual man who is curious or knows he desires anal play, may be depriving oneself out of fear that others will think that he must really be gay or have homosexual tendencies. That could not be farther from the truth! Millions of heterosexual women and men love to partake in anal play. By anal play, I mean rimming, having a finger up the ass while you’re getting a blowjob, inserting butt plugs, dildos, holding a vibrator around the opening, or rubbing the opening with your finger. And this area of the body should not be ignored when one is indulging. This is a very sensitive area, that when given the proper attention, can bring one to a new world of ecstasy.  Now, for you anal virgins, you don’t need to penetrate on the first go round. Use your fingers to massage, rub and tickle the area. The key is to start slow, be patient and try to relax. Remember this is supposed to be an enjoyable activity. Communication is absolutely essential with your partner. Let him or her know what feels good and when he or she can go further. Once you reach a comfortable point, you may try a little penetration. Be smart, use common sense and you’ll be okay. Hartley's Guide to Better Fellatio (or Woodworking 101) "was created by and for consenting adults. It is intended to offer helpful hints for more mutually fulfilling erotic experiences."  The video stars Nina Hartley, with special guest Alex Sanders. The video is broken into three parts. The first part covers the anatomy and science of the penis, the second part demonstrates the "art" of fellatio and the 3rd part is basically a porno scene.  The first part of the video goes over the anatomy and science of the penis. She uses a dildo to show the basic parts of the penis and then there's a short slide show of a few penises - basically to show the difference between a circumcised and non-circumcised penis. She also uses a diagram and skeleton to go over the anatomy of the penis. She compares the similarities between male and female genitalia. For instance a man's testicles are like a woman's ovaries. The scrotum is like the outer labia, the urethra like the inner labia and the gland like the clitoris.  I did learn a few things in the first part of the video. For instance, the prostate gland (located at the very base of the penis, near the anus) is a major source of pleasure for a man and produces the greatest amount of semen. Also, semen is made up mostly of water and vitamin C and is designed to carry sperm up into the vagina and into the fallopian tubes. Sperm travels approximately 7 inches on ejaculation - which is why it feels so good when a man orgasms.  The second part of the video demonstrates the "art" of fellatio. Why would you want to do it? According to Nina it's pleasurable and fun.   Nina says that half of being good at fellatio is the desire to do it - wanting to do it. She also says to get better you need practice and exposure - which is why I got this video. I've read and heard that giving a blow job involves the hands just as much as the mouth - but never fully understood this concept until after watching this video.  A man's penis can go numb during fellatio (which happens in the video). Nina explains that this can happen because of interruptions or if he's drunk, nervous, thinks he's not good enough or thinks you aren't going to like it. So you need to reassure him that you do.   One of the things that I liked about the video is that it is just as much, if not more, about pleasing the woman than the man. I originally got the video so that I could better please my husband, not for my own satisfaction. According to Nina, the sign of a good blow job is if you're aroused as well. "The wetter the panties the better the blow job." Throughout the video Nina explains that it is important for the woman to enjoy it - to want to do it - it shouldn't be a chore you feel obligated to do. Which had always been my mindset. I admit that after watching the video my mindset has changed. Even though she doesn't discuss barriers some women may have against giving blow jobs, somehow a lot of mine were diminished after watching this video.  The video also contains a lot of good information. Such as, watching your man masturbate to learn how he touches himself - what he finds pleasurable and incorporate that into giving him a blow job. Wetness is a key factor in fellatio. I never knew the importance of a wet penis. According to Nina, when you wet down the penis everything you do is more magnified. The wetter the dick the lighter the touch you need. "The wetter it is the nicer it feels." The man she demonstrate on, Alex, doesn't say much throughout the video, minus interjecting a few tips here and there, such as, it is more arousing when a woman removes the man's pants. He also likes it slow and thinks a lot of the pleasure in receiving a blow job comes from watching the woman doing it and knowing that she knows he's watching her. After Nina comments on how sweet tasting his cum is, he says to make cum taste "better" the man can eat sweets or kiwi to make it taste sweeter, or celery to take away the bitter taste. There's more to fellatio than just sucking the penis. You can play with the balls (but don't squeeze!), stroke the penis lightly when wet, squeeze it (harder than you think you should) but not while you're stroking it, smack/slap and tap it slightly, and lick it lightly. I noticed two things she does the most. One is flicking the tongue under the head of the penis (which is very sensitive so you need to be gentle around this area) or stimulating it with the tip of your (wet) finger. Secondly, and what I gather to be most importantly, stroking the penis with a twist - not actually twisting the penis - but twisting the stroke - like in a circle instead of just up and down. Combined with the mouth this seems to be the key element of giving good head. There are a few other factors of giving a good blow job. According to Nina, a good blow job is loud and wet sounding. Look him in the eyes and have your partner communicate with you - what he likes and wants you to do. What I noticed watching her perform, was that she isn't constantly sucking. No wonder I always got a numb mouth! She only sucks on the way up. Nice to know. She also defines some terms, such as, playing "shuttlecock" - which is when you slap the penis back and forth from side to side. And "mouth fucking," which is when you stay still and the man moves his hips into your mouth. Her suggestion is to hold the base of the dick with one or both hands and "hold on for dear life." By doing this "you don't get the choking problem...if you get hit in the back of the throat it will start your gag reflects." The key to "mouth fucking" is gripping the penis. When he pushes in your loosen your grip, when he pulls out you squeeze. According to Nina, "mouth fucking" is "the lazy woman's way to give head." She also advises you have short nails so you don't hurt yourself when you squeeze. Part three is basically a porno skit so Nina and Alex can do what they do best. I'm assuming this is to get you (and your partner) aroused so you can try out the tips she's given. I'd recommend this video to anyone who feels inadequate in the administering of a bj. However, I should point out that Nina is not a great public speaker - there is no way you'll get her confused with your health or biology teacher. For example, your teachers never would have said, "I've seen more 2 inch softies grow into 6 or 8 inch woodies than you could shake a dick at." There are some great one liners throughout the video, such as, an erection is just a guys way of saying hi! A way of being friendly and polite. ;) Summary: Here's what I gather are the fundamentals of giving good head. Keep the penis wet and use both hands to stroke and twist it at the same time as you suck on it - focusing around the head of the penis. Use one hand to stroke the penis and the other (at the base) to squeeze it. Keep the lights on and make sure the man is in a position so he can watch you. Start slow and then speed up towards the end.  I think you'll get a better idea if you get the video - I wish I would have seen it YEARS ago! My husband gave the video his stamp of approval as well. After I tried out her techniques on him, he said it was by far the best he has ever had - and trust me, I sucked at it - no pun intended. I had always made it much harder than it really is - no wonder I never liked doing it. But after seeing a "professional" in action it has given me a whole new outlook on fellatio!       Here is a description written by Nina of one of her sessions: enjoy…. It’s the freaken weekend!   (www.babydollbound.com).   So, here's the scoop: Ernest and I set up the gyno bed so that we could strap Babydoll into it..  So, we picked her up at her friends house and brought her home. We cuffed, collared and high-heeled her. We looked at dirty pictures while she had a shot of good single malt scotch, molesting her all the while. Moving over to the dining room table, Ernest munched her while I took pictures of her face. I had Ernest pinch her pussy lips together to pinch her clit while I s-lo-w-l-y plucked a few stray hairs from around her pussy. She shivered in delight. Next time, I'll strap her down and make a bigger deal of it!  Now was time for whipping and walking. We brought her over to the suspension bar and clipped her wrists to the chains and gave it a few cranks. Now, she was helpless in the face of our sadism. Ernest brought over a brace of stick whips and one leather one and we set to work. Babydoll took several deep breaths and got deeper into subspace. He cracked a couple of good ones on her bubble butt and moved to her front to watch her face while I had myself a good time. I took the dressage and steadily flicked it back and forth across her cheeks, just grazing the skin. The heat builds up slowly this way. Ernest got a cane and began on her front, paying special attention to the sides of Babydoll's perky tits.  Then I hit her across both cheeks, using the thin dressage like a cane. Whap! Whap! Whap! went the wiry whip to leave red lines on her cheeks. Whap! Whap! Whap! down the backs of her legs I went, relentless, waiting for her to lift her foot in mercy, but it never came. Ernest was touching her clit and I was hurting her from the other side and Babydoll was coming again.  We got her to her knees in front of the mirror. Sitting on the bed, she orally serviced each of us and go. Now it was time for fucking, and fuck we did. Ernest and I do a mini-gang bang fit to beat the band, if not fuck the girls. He got on top of her and I took off her shoes and whipped her soles, sending her over again. I love to see Ernest fuck women and I love to see how happy they are to be fucked by him. I pinched her nose, we covered her face, we stuck our fingers down her mouth, we slapped her, never letting up on the fucking.  When it was my turn to fuck her, Ernest stuck his dick in her mouth to stifle her moans and cries. I leaned forward enough to get some, too, and he smothered her with his balls, muffling her orgasms. We used her roughly and with great humor, since she is such a slutty girl.  We traded off fucking a few more times, ending up with her ass in the air, butt plug still in. I caned her upper cheeks while he fucked her and she came again, quivering and shaking on his dick. Finally, it was time for the big finish. She got back on her knees in front of Ernest and took his dick in her mouth. I caned her again, steadily, patiently, until she came again. She's so good, she never used her teeth once.  Whew! It was amazing to us to see that the whole thing had taken only about 90 minutes instead of the three hours it felt like we had been playing. It goes to show how much three motivated people can do when they set their minds to it. That's where kink is kinda like communism: to each according to his need, from each according to his ability. We like to show a girl a good time, and Babydoll knows how to get the most out of us.  Now, Babydoll has showered and has finished cleaning up the dungeon. It's been nice typing this while she works, naked, making the space clean for her private time with Ernest this Tuesday while I'm in Denver.  Soon, Carol Queen and Robert Lawrence will be here and we'll all go out for Chinese food. Ah, what a Sunday!   urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       The word lesbian doesn't quite describe the sexual curiosity women today have about one another. They are like each other's archeological dig, in which the excavation of genitals, breasts, the taste of skin is where they look to find what is  missing in their lives, something men cannot give them . — Nancy Friday, The Power of Beauty    Erotica - Madonna   Erotica, romance (repeat) My name is Dita I'll be your mistress tonight I'd like to put you in a trance  If I take you from behind Push myself into your mind When you least expect it Will you try and reject it If I'm in charge and I treat you like a child Will you let yourself go wild Let my mouth go where it wants to  Give it up, do as I say Give it up and let me have my way I'll give you love, I'll hit you like a truck I'll give you love, I'll teach you how to ...

Madonna came out with her song “Holiday” and I about flipped, then, when I saw her video “Borderline” I was in love.  She was everything I wanted to be; sassy, beautiful, mouthy, liberated and one hell of a cool dresser.  I emulated her style with the lace gloves, rosary jewelry, black rubber bracelets, tube minni skirts, and a black bra with white lace tank top.  I memorized her songs, her lyrics, her dance moves, and even lusted after Sean Penn when she was with him.  She was the epitome of a sexually liberated 80’s chick; humping a stage at the VMAs in a wedding dress cooing "Like a Virgin", and a few years later, seducing a sexy black Jesus while gospel choirs belted "Like a Prayer."  She was the It girl, and I wanted to be just like her.     Madonna and Bi-sexuality  I wonder how growing up in the age of Madonna effects a girls sexual image?  I saw Madonna as strong, beautiful, sex object, businesswoman, masturbator, fashion plate and bi-sexual.  Madonna made out with other women in public, including Sandra Bernhardt and Naomi Campbell (most recently Brittany Spears).  Madonna didn’t care if other people called her trash, she aimed to push the envelope, challenge norms, and break taboos.     My How to Be Bisexual Degree  I admit the bi-sexual thing intrigued me, but I never really thought about it much until I attended UC Berkeley and entered the Women Studies program.  I now jokingly call this my “How to be bi-sexual” degree.  When I started at Cal I was just coming out of a bad marriage and I really wasn’t ready for sexual relations of any kind.  But the things I saw, and heard about, would blow my mind and shatter images for years to come.    Women Studies at Cal  Women studies isn’t a bunch of man-haters, like one would think; its basically a bunch of liberal arts students studying all collegiate aspects from a “female” perspective.  There are classes on Freudian theory, history of women in the US, anthropological studies of gender, socialization of gender, images of gender in film, women contributions to literature and art, etc.  It was a great program, and taught by world renowned scholars.  I definitely found myself in this program.  There actually were a few males in most of the classes, and some even decided to major or minor in the program.    Manic-Panicked looks  Women in the program were a myriad of types and personalities.  There were some that looked like Donna of 90210, fresh out of So Cal, with blond hair and preppy clothes.  Others had that hippie girl look; hairy legs and armpits, flowing dresses, no makeup, and wild flowing hair.  Some girls cultivated the riot grrrl look with black combat boots, black clothing, punked out hair and tattoos.  Mostly, girls just looked like typical college students, with shorts, t-shirts, backpacks, and maybe the occasional Birkenstock.  I kinda went for the punk look, preferring to wear my doc martins with short summer dresses and manic-panicked colored hair.  We were all different; there definitely was no stereotype in the looks department. Some of us wore make up and shaved (like me) other were all natural, and felt makeup and other feminine markings were the “tools of the oppressor”. Yes, there were some lesbian students, Hell Berkeley had classes on gay and lesbian studies, female sexuality, and I think there was one called “the power of the vagina”.  One lesbian student I remember had wild curly hair, piercing blue eyes, and like to sport shirts that read “men cant live with them… don’t have too” with a big rainbow triangle.  She especially liked to wear this around Greek row.       Bi-sexual trend  What I noticed was most popular around women studies students, wasn’t a common style or belief system.  Most popular among women studies students was the self title “bi-sexual”.  Shit, it seemed EVERYONE claimed to be bi-sexual, married, girls with boyfriends, single chicks, you name it.  My best friend at Berkeley, who claimed to have slept with over 75 guys, took on the “title” of bi-sexual soon after starting college.  I remember her saying to me “I just want to see what being with a girl is like”, I don’t know if she was coming onto me or what, I just know at that time I was too sexually repressed to even think about that.  She later had a “coming out” experience with the curly haired lesbian in one of the professors office after hours. She attended “women only” hot-tub parties, and safe sex performances by this SF troop called the safe sex sluts who demonstrated on live volunteers how to use dental dams, gloves, etc.  She would tell me about these adventures and I would act all shocked but get excited and intrigued secretly inside.  She went on to have threesomes and other bisexual fun and of course is now married to some guy and expecting kids.     Bi-sexual Berkeley Babes  I had some other “bi-sexual” girlfriends that I would hang out with.  These girls grew up in Berkeley, where being bisexual was the rage, though they had multiple boyfriends, I guess they did some messing around with each other as teenagers, or whenever they were lonely or bored.  This one girl F and I used to go clubbing and dancing together around Berkeley.  We would get on the dance floor and start freakin each other.  We would be rubbin our bodies together, feeling each other up, and get real “lesbo”.  We would also go to Fetish clubs in full on bondage gear in SF, and spank each other, make out, and rub up against each other.  This was mainly for “show” as we liked the reaction we would get from the boys.  This was about as far as I ever got with a girl.  I did have one hot bi-sexual chick pick up on me really hard while I was going out with J.  It wasn’t until my boyfriend J that I became sexually liberated, and this was my senior year at Cal.  This was my first major relationship after my marriage, and I was totally into lovin and sexing this man.  This really super hot chick, with a perfect body, dark hair and big doe eyes would always come onto me when we ran into each other.  She would tell J “Im gonna steal your girlfriend”.  I was so flattered, as she had been the object of love and lust in a famous rock song of that time.  One time, I was drunk off cider and beer (snakebite) at a Berkeley pub and she took me into a dark closet where we held each other real close for about 30 minutes.  J ended coming in and busting up the scene, but I always wonder what would have happened.  She is married with kids now too.    Now days, girls who claim to be bi-sexual seem to be following in a growing trend.  According to this article in Florida’s Sun Senital .    urlLink Trendy Bi-sexual grrrls   It's not an unusual scene, according to South Florida high school students, who say the newest trend for teen girls isn't wearing the latest designer jeans or driving a cool car, but declaring themselves to be bisexual.  "Some do it for attention. Some do it because guys like it. And some do it just because they can. It's definitely a fad," says Stranahan High student Christy Shalley, president of the Fort Lauderdale school's Gay Straight Alliance.    Ms. Nancy Friday  One of my favorite authors on sexuality is Nancy Friday.  She writes books on women’s fantasies, my two favorites being “Women on Top” and “My Secret Garden”.  It seems that many women, bored housewives etc fantasize about being with other women.   According to Ms. Friday  “The percentage of women claiming to be bi-sexual and or lesbian in real life has risen steadily in recent years; also, the number of women who fantasize about other women has soared. I could comment at great length regarding how traditionally and comfortably women have had erotic dreams about other women since I began my research 25 years ago.”    urlLink Nancy Friday website    Its the End of the World as we Know it... and I feel fine.... I wonder does this make us all bi-sexual?  Is it really common for us to fantasize about other women?  I must admit, I’m not attracted to the bull-dyke lesbian types.  They don’t do it for me at all.  But the Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry types…. YOWZA!  They rock my fantasy world.  Would I ever really “do it” with a chick?  Or is this just a fantasy?  I can tell you, that I really LOVE men, and I don’t think I could ever live without a nice hard cock.  Its also that yin/yang thing, feminine/masculine… I like having an opposite.  I dunno, maybe its just a masturbation fantasy, maybe it will never happen.  Or maybe its something I would do for a man, so he could watch and later join?  Im not sure…I just wonder how many of us actually think about it?   If we grow up feeling that there is something wrong with what lies between our legs,  we will not just see that place as repugnant, a sewer, The Cloaca that we can never make beautiful, but we assume that like the ugly birthmark on a leg or arm, this is what people see when they look at us.   —Nancy Friday, The Power of Beauty   Another quote I stole off the internet.   Women are at a stage in history where they are truly coming into their own - financially, socially, and sexually. Women have more disposable income, careers, extended reproductive lives, and are more confident and secure than they ever have been before. In many respects, this is the direct result of the feminist movement, which was the impetus of many developments that are now considered social norms.   urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Masturbation, what is the taboo?  Tonight millions of people around the world are doing it, from all ages, all shapes, and lifestyle choices.  Is it a sin?  Is it immoral?  Does it make you a pervert?   Is it dirty?   Divinyls Lyrics  I Touch Myself Lyrics   I love myself I want you to love me When I'm feelin' down I want you above me I search myself I want you to find me I forget myself I want you to remind me  Chorus: I don't want anybody else When I think about you I touch myself I don't want anybody else Oh no, oh no, oh no  You're the one who makes me come running You're the sun who makes me shine When you're around I'm always laughing I want to make you mine  I close my eyes And see you before me Think I would die If you were to ignore me A fool could see Just how much I adore you I get down on my knees I'd do anything for you  Chorus  I love myself I want you to love me When I'm feelin' down I want you above me I search myself I want you to find me I forget myself I want you to remind me   I want you I don't want anybody else And when I think about you I touch myself Ooh, oooh, oooooh, aaaaaah   Growing up as a young girl, I always though masturbation was something to be ashamed of.  It was for dirty, and for desperate girls, with severe mental illness.  I believed this so much that I was afraid to actually get to know my body.  I don’t think I even realized the power of the clitoris, I had no idea that female orgasm was so intricately tied to it.  My masturbatory experiences in my youth consisted of getting naked and exposing myself (to no one of course, but the thrill of getting caught was all the same).  Any time I actually thought about masturbating, I would picture my dead grandmother looking down at me from heaven and this was enough to shame me into purity.  This lack of masturbating caused a lot of sexual problems later in life.  I didn’t know myself, I had no idea how to relax, what I liked, and what felt good.  When I had sex the first few times I felt nothing, pain and some strokin yes, but no stimulation, no orgasm.  I wouldn’t have an orgasm until my early 20’s, and after I was married.  When I was first married, sex was a thrill because it was sex, and it was naughty.  But there was really no pleasure, no release.  When the marriage got ugly, I wasn’t interested in sex anymore, I mean why give it up to someone you despise?  It was then that I learned about masturbating and experienced my first orgasm.  I realized that if I laid on the floor, and watched some porn movie (while husband was asleep in another room) that I could move and twist in a way that put pressure on my pelvis and wa-la would produce an orgasm.  Oh the satisfaction of experiencing your first orgasm, especially if it was later in life.  It was like, Oh, that is what it feels like, and you take on a new love for sex.  After I was divorced I bought my first vibrator.  Not the dildo kind, but the kind you plug into the wall and it has a lot of power.  I was in HEAVEN.  I realized I could have an orgasm in under 3 minutes.  Wow, I became somewhat obsessed, wanting orgasms a few times a day.  I was still leery about sex after the divorce, until I met my boyfriend J.  J taught me how to love penises, and how you can learn from porno’s how to really please each other.  We had sex many times a day, and I was able to have orgasms for most of it.  We then got dirty, and began mutually masturbating to porn, having sex in public places, and other “dirty” forms of sex.  I started loving sex in any way shape or form, and J used to joke that he “created a monster”.    Needless to say J and I only lasted a few years, but he taught me a lifetime of lessons about sex.  I still think masturbation is the key for women to get familiar with their bodies and learn now to have orgasm.  Im sure it comes naturally for some women, but for neurotics such as myself, who has to shut out images of dead grandmothers in heaven, it takes practice and patience.   I totally recommend a vibrator to any women.  You can use them during sex too.  A fast moving hand also works well, or a dildo with vibrating bunny ears.  I have also heard that shower massagers work, or the bathtub water.  Whatever it takes, make it happen.   Sex needs to be experienced by both parties, and no, the culmination is not the male cum shot.  (though I see that this is the focus of most porns).   Most importantly, NEVER forget the Clitoris!

The joke is that these women hang around and "chasin' fellas in the Navy".  -From Rap Dictionary    Bremelo  -  term popularized by Sir Mix Alot to describe a large, unattractive woman who resides in or frequents the city of Bremerton, WA to establish "relations" with Navy personnel    Artist: Sir Mix-A-Lot  Song Title: Bremelo  Album: Swass     Here's a gory kinda story, 'bout an obese freak With a forty inch waist and a ten inch beak, Overweight and out of shape with a triple chin, Her brassiere strikes fear in the hearts of men,  The Girls a bremelo The Girls a bremelo  Me and Terry hopped a ferry, we were lookin Swass When a dip hit the ship we were almost tossed It was a big bremelo standing on my toe, An enormous jelly-belly tryin' to say hello I was really kinda frightened as she looked my way, I tried to run because here buns made the ferry sway To be blunt she was fat and ready for combat On the way to Bremerton where the fat is at, The Girls a bremelo.

By the time I waas a teenager, SirMixalot had made women from my town world famous with his song “bremelo”. This song would haunt me for years to come.  I escaped Bremerton 19 by marrying a townie who joined the navy.  Never wanting to return, I lived in Okinawa, San Diego, Oakland, and Virginia until 2000, when I packed up and moved back “home”.     Back in Black Baby  For the last 4 years I have lived in this town, full of Douglass fir trees, lumber mills, tattoo parlors, churches, rednecks with gun racks, sailors aplenty, and oh yes, fat women who we call “bremelos”.  I remember “bremelos” growing up here, they were the fat chicks from our high schools who brought sailors (or “squids” as we called them) in uniform to the senior prom.  We always looked down on these girls, and considered them pretty desperate to be seen with a navy guy.  Bad girls dated navy guys, good girls stuck with the townies who passed us around like cheap cans of lucky logger at a redneck bbq.  Of course, the townie I married became a sailor, and my status evolved to that of navy wife.  I lived in navy housing in San Diego for 3 years, and oh the things that I saw.  Navy wives are a special breed, most becoming heavy set after popping out a few kids, and most also seem to have been married to at least 2 different sailors by the age of 21.  It was then that I learned the term “Westpac Widow”  -women whose husbands were at sea and are trolling the local bars looking for action.     Crazy ass Bremerton grrrls  While I was living in California, most of my high school friends in Bremerton began dating sailors, I mean come on, easy access here.  The male to female ratio in Bremerton is like 30 to 1, odds in the girls favor.  I heard stories of wild sailor sex parties, couple swapping, and various one-night stand escapades.  Another strange thing started happening to my friends back home, they started becoming bigger.  It seemed the sluttier they became, the bigger they became too.  All of my friends dating squids (or married to them) cheated.  Every westpac they would become “westpac widows” hit the bars and have some fun.  I saw this when I came home to visit.  Bremerton was considered my ego boost town, as I loved visiting the dive bars with my friends and feeling my power.  At that time, I still preferred flings with townies, mostly because I had blossomed since high school, and I liked snagging a guy from my past.  My friends however, started reminding me of the women in “Officer and a Gentlemen”.  This movie was actually filmed not far from Bremerton, and there is actually a shot of the battleships in Bremerton as Richard Gere rides off on his motorcycle in the beginning.  Anyway, the women totally remind me of that movie, work factory or grocery store jobs until they score some sailor.  Otherwise left to life in blue-collar hell. In Officer and a Gentlemen Sargent  Foley warns the recruits about the women in the area, “Bremelo” types  who like to snag onto sailors because it's their ticket out of town. During the course of the film, we learn that the local women get themselves pregnant in order to hold onto their boyfriends, this Im sure happens quite a bit in Bremerton.  (sigh).  Gotta love Bremelo ethos.     Goin Hog Wild  When I moved back to Bremerton in 2000, I emarked on a three year relationship with a townie who was also a local “rock star”.  The relationship started to get on my nerves too much, and we ended it a few months ago.  Since then, I have been hog wild single, and doing all the Bremerton Grrrl things I have never experienced…. Like baiting sailors… (sailor bait… another word for Bremelo).   Bremelo spotting  Now I never considered myself a Bremelo, or sure as shit ever wanted to be one. Here is another definition The word Bremelo was  explaned this way to me.   Bremerton + Bufflo =  Bremelo. Big Bremerton women  looking to hook up with navy  guys to support them.  Here is another description I found on the web; its quite good.   Fresh faced young sailors  are the natural prey of  Bremelos. You can find them at  Walmart and Kitsap Mall.  They certainly aren't  limited to those places.  Look for two toned hair, and  large sized bodies squeezed  into Brittany Spears wanna  be clothes. They have babies  and toddles at least 3 or  more running around  screaming, crying and  generally running amuk.  Occasionally, there is a  very stressed overwelmed and  frightened looking booter  following them around  obediently. They smoke  Virginia Slims and drink  Mountain Dew. The kids are  trained to call any young  man who comes around more  than once or twice..."my new  daddy". Bremelos' can be  seen at the photo copier  having whining temper  tantrums as they try to make  copies of the baby pics of  their newest meal ticket.   They flaunt tattoo's of that  ubiqitus icon of white trash- hood, Taz or Bugs bunny.  They   come out in the early  spring after a brief  hybernation to bear their  young and proclaim their  readiness to procreate  status by displaying their  famous "bremelo roll" of  sagging midrif. The more  experienced and mature  bremelos have double chins  and double love handles and  gold thumb rings. The truly  succesful bremelo reaches  coveted Mommalo status with  the arrival of her first  grandchild..........usually  before her 28th birthday.  Always before graduation.   They like classy names for  their young bremelo-ettes,  like Tidonna and Turquoise  abd Destiny. And Cheyanne  (aka Shi shi) They are a highly succesful  life form and have survived  unchanged since shortly  after the Nipsig first  landed.  I knew those Ho’s; short ass frayed daisey duke shorts, bleach blond frizzy hair, cottage cheese ass, saggy boobs in low cut shirts, and sometimes missing teeth.  I would see them at the grocery store, shopping with their six kids, or eating a Dennys, or out at the dive bars, smoking and dancing with sailors who were obviously not there husbands.  But there has to be something in the water here, because it seems unavoidable, like destiny, that women here eventually become squid bait.    Squid Baitin at the Horse and Cow  An easy pick up place for squids is this Maritime Dance Club, the Horse and Cow.  The place is full of horney and drunk squids, all looking for action.  My friends and I always go and drink a lot of vodka redbulls and head straight to the dance floor to dance to Eminem or Outkast, or whatever song happens to be on.  I usually start dirty dancing and actin a fool.  One night, shortly after my breakup, I met a blue-eyed hottie squid on the dance floor.  We started dirty dancing, and freakin, and one thing led to another…. We started makin out HO style right on the dance floor!  I took that young sailor boy home and freaked him good.  I didn’t want to know names, didn’t want anything really, but cheap, nasty sex with a young ass, beautiful bodied, stud muffin.  Had to get that out of my system….its just so dang easy to do here.   Sailor Boy-Toy  A month or so later, I was out freakin on the dance floor again, and I met a new Sailor Boy-Toy.  We freaked, and slow danced, but this time just exchanged numbers.  He is younger than me by 11 years, but very cute, and not your typical “sailor”.  Needless to say, I have been seeing this young hunk for over a month.  Its not a serious thing, or even really a thing, just mutual lustin, sexing, and some company.  I have never “dated” a squid before, this is all new to me.  Yes I was married to a “squid” but he was a townie when we dated.  My current squid toy is very busy, out to sea a lot doing sea trials, or busy preparing the ship for one.  I probably wont see him again for over a month, he is out to sea…. (sigh) the life of a seamen.  Oh he is a submariner…. Hence my expression “Submariners Do It Deeper!”  Another Bremelo expression I like to use is “Nuttin like havin Seamen in your Mouth”  LOL   What's happening here?!?!?!?  Is something in the water here or what?  Have I become a Bremelo?  This is really starting to scare me.  Since living here, I have gained some weight (mostly in the boobs and ass, baby have back!), which I attribute to lack of sunlight, depression, and my taking anti-depressants.  Hell, I gotta get out of this place.   In a few years I may sprout bleach blond hair, cottage cheese legs, and who the hell knows what.  HELP IVE FALLEN AND I CANT GET UP!    urlLink Bremelo website   This site is actually putting together a dance troop of Bremelos…. Here's a bit from the site...  We are putting together a dancing trio (volunteers) for our festival showings.  Experience? "we no need no stinkin' experience!"  Requirements: 1. Resident of Bremerton/Kitsap County (proclaimed Bremelo) 2. Over 18 years of age 3. Good dispostion and teeth  4. Provide own transportation to events (no cdl required) 5. Good rhythym and sense of humor 6. Provide own sweatpants/spandex 7. Able to travel short distances in Kitsap County 8. No gratuity box needed as one will be provided 9. No weight requirements     Here is a sailor Bremelo joke for ya to close this off.     A large Humpback whale is lazily enjoying a beautiful day when he sees a female Humpback whale (aka Bremelo) just a little ways off, and he thinks to himself that he's going to try to impress her...  He swims over to her, and breeches the surface, showing off the large hump on his back.  She looked unimpressed as she breached and showed a larger more well formed hump herself.  Now, a little embarrassed, he tries again to impress her by taking a breath and blowing a huge cloud of mist and water with a really nice rainbow in it.  Once again she looked unimpressed and she blew a larger cloud of mist, with a more beautiful rainbow.  Now clearly agitated, the Male sees a Navel vessel in the distance and races off toward it. Just before he collides with the ship, he dives, jumps out of the water and as he sails over the bow of the ship, he plucks a sailor off the deck and in one gulp swallows him whole!  He swam back to her very proud of himself, only to find the female object of his attentions with a disgusted look on her face...  As she swam off she said .. ."I'll Hump, I'll Blow, BUT I WON'T SWALLOW SEAMEN!              urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       Get the Boys Ma, its D-Derby Time! Here is a little update on living in redneckville/sailor town.  The D-Derby was this weekend, and I live within spittin distance from the Rodeo hall where this occurs.  For those of you unfamiliar with a D-Derby, it’s a Demolition Derby where these rednecks spray paint old cars with slogans like “this buds for you” and then drive them around a track like bumper cars until the last car driving wins.  This is a weekly event here in town, and what a show it is.  The parking lot is always filled with Mac Trucks and primered Cameros.  Inside the venue is a fashion show of redneck styles and designs that really highlight the local gene pool.  AC/DC blasts from the overhead speakers, and the smell of dust and car fumes permeates the air.  Mullets rule the scene, of all different sizes and shapes, father and son mullets, and the occasional duck tail.  I have always thought it was cruel to give a 3 year old a mullet, however, this is stock issue at the D-Derby.  Women dress as skanky and nasty as possible, regardless of body shape.  Spandex skirts and pants, tight fat belly revealing shirts, and hair all ratted out like an old Motely Crue video.  Everyone is smoking….  The beer garden is the official hang out spot for singles, and you can hear belching, farting jokes, and cat whistles as you walk by.    Gotta Love the D-Derby.    Here are some Jedi Redneck jokes I though Y’All would enjoy..   urlLink You Might Be A Redneck Jedi If . . . ·	  . . . you use your lightsaber to cut the bottlecap off a beer.  ·	. . . you say "these are not the beers you are looking for."  ·	. . . that "disturbance in the Force" was just last night's baked beans.  ·	. . . the inside of your house looks more like Dagobah than the outside.  ·	. . . the Force isn't the only thing that runs in your family.  ·	. . . you call Hank Williams Jr. "master".  ·	. . . your landspeeder has a gun rack.  ·	. . . you meditate to old CCR records.  ·	. . . your lightsaber has a beer can crusher in the base.  ·	. . . there is more oil in your robes than in your astromech droid.  ·	. . . you fight with a lightsaber in one hand and a spit cup in the other.  ·	. . . you use a Jedi mind trick to stop the beer truck.  ·	. . . you ever lost a hand during a lightsaber fight because you had to spit.  ·	 . . at least one wing of your X-Wing is primer colored.  ·	. . . you think Stormtroopers are just KKK members with really good sheets.  ·	. . . you have ever used the Force in conjunction with fishing / bowling.  ·	. . . your father's name is Garth Vader.  ·	. . . you have ever beaten up Han Solo for lookin' at your sister.  ·	 . . . . you have bantha horns on the front of your landspeeder.  ·	. .  . . your master ever said "My finger you will pull..hmmm?"  ·	. . . you have ever had an X-wing up on blocks in your yard.  ·	. . .you have ever used the force to get yourself another beer so you didn't have to wait for a commercial.  ·	. . . you have fuzzy dice hanging in the cockpit of your X-Wing.  ·	. . . you've ever looked at your sister, thought she was one hot babe, and kissed her.  ·	. . . your favorite bar caters primarily to smugglers and bounty hunters.  ·	. . .  you've ever given someone a wedgie by using the force.  ·	. . .  you didn't read the whole Jedi manual because there were no pictures.  ·	. . . you have ever used baling wire and/or duct tape to make repairs on your landspeeder.  ·	. . . you feel that duct tape is like the force: it has a light side and a dark side and it holds the universe together.  ·	. . . you ever fantasized about Princess Leah wearing Daisy Duke shorts.  ·	. . . you have the doors of your X-wing welded shut and you have to get in through the window.  ·	. . . you were the only person drinking Jack Daniels during the cantina scene.  . . . you hear . . .

       "I must relate the horrors as I recall them, in the hope that some force for mankind might be moved to relieve forever the unfortunate creatures who are still imprisoned in the back wards of decaying institutions".  – Frances Farmer on her past experience as a mental patient    “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds"  –Albert Einstein   Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle - Nirvana   It's so relieving To know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid It's so relaxing  To hear that you're asking wherever you get your way It's so soothing To know that you'll sue me, this is starting to sound the same  I miss the comfort in being sad (x3)   In her false witness, we hope you're still with us, To see if they float or drown Our favorite patient, a display of patience, Disease-covered Puget Sound She'll come back as fire, to burn all the liars, And leave a blanket of ash on the ground    I miss the comfort in being sad (x3)   Im crazy give me a lobotomy!    Frances Farmer, Hollywood Starlet, lobotomized like Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Coo coos Nest.  Why?  She was loud, she smoked, she drank, she talked back, she was headstrong, mouthy.  She did not fit into the 50’s mold of womanhood.     Those damn crazy fuckers...  People who are different are often chastised, harassed, and sometimes killed, for not fitting societies mold.  Near my redneck hometown, is the town of Steilacoom. Here is the infamous hospital that imprisoned Frances Farmer for much of her life.  Within the walls of this sanitarium, Farmers creative spirit died, forever silencing a great mind.     Free to live?  I worry sometimes about what happens to “freaks” and “crazies” in society.  My last post describes 3 teenagers wrongfully convicted of murder based on the “evidence” that they wore black clothes, read Stephan King, and listened to Metallica.   Often times, society perceives someone as crazy for creativity, brilliance and nonconformism.   Im melting.... Im melting....  If I lived 200 years ago, would I have been burned at the stake for being a witch?  If I lived in the 1950’s would I have been institutionalized and given a lobotomy?  The answer is probably yes to both.    Western State Sanitarium  The ruins of Old Western State Sanitarium are about a 40-minute drive from my hometown.  Here Francis Farmer was among thousands of “deviants” institutionalized and possibly lobotomized.  Deviants were manic-depressives, gays and lesbians, outspoken nonconformists, recovering war veterans, and others.  Old Western State sits in ruins, with the boiler room remaining intact.  According to folklore, it is haunted by many of the former residents.     Frances Farmer (info stolen from web)   Born in Seattle, Frances Farmer studied drama at the University of Washington, Seattle. In 1936, she went to Hollywood where she secured a seven-year contract with Paramount. In 1942, she was wrongfully declared 'mentally incompetent' and committed to a series of asylums and public mental hospitals, where eventually she received a lobotomy. After eleven years she was released, and spent some of the remaining years of her life tending the parents who had committed her and taking odd jobs. She appeared on "This Is Your Life" (1952), and ran her own TV show, "Frances Farmer Presents" (1958) for six years. She died of cancer in 1970.    Lobotomy --   This was par for the course for any “undesirable”, a way to control someone who would not be controlled, a way to cure “mental illness”.  As gruesome and barbaric as this may seem to us now, hundreds of thousands would be lobotomized between 1935-1960.  Dr Walter Freeman is known as the pioneer of lobotomy, he performed over 3,000, some in a mass assembly line butcher.     Description of Lobotomy (from web)   The procedure involved first knocking the patient unconscious with two or three jolts of electricity from an electroshock therapy machine. After the convulsions subsided and the patient lay insensate, Walter Freeman lifted the patient's eyelid and inserted an ice pick-like instrument called a leucotome through a tear duct. A few taps with a surgical hammer breached the bone. Freeman took a position behind the patient's head, pushed the leucotome about an inch and a half into the frontal lobe of the patient's brain, and moved the sharp tip back and forth. Then he repeated the process with the other eye socket.     The King of Lobotomy meets a Holywood Starlet   In the late 1940s at Western State Hospital in Steilacoom, Wash., Freemen met the movie actress Frances Farmer, according to Farmer's biographer William Arnold.  Farmer had been a patient there for five years, the victim of her family's intolerance of her unconventional and wild behavior. Whether Freeman lobotomized her remains unclear, though Arnold says he did. Farmer's relatives and Western State's staff psychiatrist at the time said it never happened, but Frank Freeman says his father verified Farmer's operation and identified her as the patient shown in the world's most famous lobotomy photograph, an oft-reproduced shot showing Freeman using his hairy and muscular arms to hammer the leucotome into a woman's eye at Western State as a crowd watched. Filmed interviews of Farmer made after her discharge from the hospital show a detached and flatly demeanored (though clearly intelligent) woman, an outcome consistent with lobotomy   urlLink Frances meets Freeman    urlLink Dr. Freeman    Western State Hospital   By any measure, Western State Hospital in the 1940s was a dismal place. More than 2,700 patients -- 500 more than the official capacity -- were crammed into its antiquated wards. Many patients were housed in decrepit, turn-of-the-century buildings, similar to one that had been destroyed by fire (killing two patients) in 1947. After the fire, a makeshift ward had been established in an unheated breezeway originally used as an exercise court. The area had been enclosed with canvas, but it provided little protection against wind, rain, and cold. The P-I found that it was still being used as a ward two years later.  Because of staff shortages, patients were being put to bed around 4 p.m. and kept there 12 hours. Inadequate salaries and poor living quarters complicated the problem of getting efficient help. Live-in ward attendants were housed in a basement with sagging floors and crumbling cement walls. Dr. William N. Keller, hospital superintendent, said the hospital needed about $8 million to improve the facilities and expand the staff, a figure far greater than what the Legislature was willing to provide. “People seem to be more interested in how cheaply they can take care of their mentally ill rather than how well,” he commented (P-I, 1949).   “Lobotomy Gets Them Home”   Given these conditions, hospital administrators were naturally interested in a new kind of surgery that promised to help psychologically disabled people leave the institution and return to useful lives: transorbital lobotomy. The procedure involved the insertion of a thin, icepick-like instrument called a leucotome under a patient’s eyelid and into the frontal lobes of the brain, where it was used to sever nerves thought to cause severe emotional disturbances. It was developed by Dr. Walter G. Freeman, a prominent Washington, D.C., neurologist and psychiatrist, whose motto was “lobotomy gets them home.”  Freeman demonstrated his technique at Western State Hospital on August 19, 1947, operating on 13 patients. At one point, a photographer snapped his picture, producing what has become the world’s most famous lobotomy photograph. The often-reproduced image shows Freeman wielding his leucotome on a comatose woman. Before his death in 1972, Freeman reportedly told his son Frank that the woman in the photograph was Frances Farmer. said she had heard women on her ward “pleading” for lobotomies, because “They had been told the operation would sever the little nerve that controls one’s sense of grief” (Indianapolis Star). But she reportedly told Kibbee and other friends that she did not have the operation .    urlLink Western State Hospital and ghosts    Old Western State Sanitarium, Tacoma/Lakewood.

Should we be able to dress however we want.?  As adults “merging” into corporate (un)america, of course you must mold; cookie cutter corporate borings.  But isnt the teenage years the age of exploration?      Redneck Witch Hunt  Rednecks in small towns love witch hunts, and they love  blaming the local “freak” for their problems.  This has been scene through out history “Salem witch trials” the best example.  Okay now, Puritanism are kinda white trash rednecks, they were seperatists living in the woods (LOL).   The FREAKS did it!    Three kids have been put behind bars for living in a small-ass redneck town, listening to Metallica, wearing black clothes, and appreciating goddess religions and wicca.  Because they were “weird” they were obviously satanic.  When a murder happens without a clear killer, who best to blame but the “freaks”     Read the information below on the West Memphis 3..     Remember Einstein’s famous quote “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds"    urlLink Free the West Memphis Three!       Shortly after three eight-year-old boys were found mutilated and murdered in West Memphis, Arkansas, local newspapers stated the killers had been caught. The police assured the public that the three teenagers in custody were definitely responsible for these horrible crimes. Evidence?   The same police officers coerced an error-filled “confession” from Jessie Misskelley Jr., who is mentally handicapped. They subjected him to 12 hours of questioning without counsel or parental consent, audio-taping only two fragments totaling 46 minutes. Jessie recanted it that evening, but it was too late— Misskelley, Jason Baldwin and Damien Echols were all arrested on June 3, 1993, and convicted of murder in early 1994.   Although there was no physical evidence, murder weapon, motive, or connection to  the victims, the prosecution pathetically resorted to presenting black hair and clothing, heavy metal t-shirts, and Stephen King novels as proof that the boys were sacrificed in a satanic cult ritual . Unfathomably, Echols was sentenced to death, Baldwin received life without parole, and Misskelley got life plus 40.   For over 11 years, The West Memphis Three have been imprisoned for crimes they didn’t commit. Echols waits in solitary confinement for the lethal injection our tax dollars will pay for. They were all condemned by their poverty, incompetent defense, satanic panic and a rush to judgment.    Paradise Lost Movie Editorial Reviews Amazon.com On May 6, 1993, the mutilated bodies of three 8-year-old boys were found in a shallow creek in West Memphis, Arkansas. A short time later police arrested three local teenagers, linking the boys' killings to a satanic ritual. One of the boys confessed. The intriguing court case was about to unfold as filmmakers Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky ventured forth to make this documentary. They captured footage of not only courtroom proceedings but also interviews with the major players in trial--parents, suspects, lawyers. The documentary filmmakers, whose previous film, Brother's Keeper, is as intriguing of a crime story you'll ever see, tells this story without re-creations or flashbacks. The film makes a clear argument that the court trial may not be about witchcraft but a witch hunt. As with any great drama, the faces and situations are etched upon the viewer; however, we are dealing with real lives and real crimes (told gruesomely and necessarily by police photographs and videotape), and the impact is far greater. And so is the maddening ambivalence of the trial. Like the O.J. Simpson fiasco, a verdict is reached but the truth is questioned. Did police make fatal errors the night of the crime? Do last-minute clues lead to justice? Who's lying on the stand? As with Roger and Me and Hoop Dreams, we have a provocative single incident that holds a mirror to many of society's problems. The results are just more horrifying. The Emmy-winning film was followed four years later by Paradise Lost 2: Revelations. --Doug Thomas   Editorial Reviews Amazon.com Directors Joe Berlinger and Bruce Sinofsky return to the scene of the crime with this urgent follow-up to their harrowing 1996 documentary, Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills. That profoundly disturbing film chronicles the tragic and twisted case of three young men--Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley--who were convicted of the brutal 1993 murders of three second graders. The film suggests that perhaps their only crime was dressing in black and liking Metallica. To the townspeople, this smacked of Satanism and marked them as made-to-order suspects. Meanwhile, Mark Byars, the stepfather of one of the victims emerged from the film as a "Why-isn't-anyone-following-up-on-this?" suspect. Revelations, which, for those who missed the first film, efficiently recaps the case, and charts the trio's maddening appeals process (police browbeat a confession out of Misskelley, who has an IQ of 71, after 12 hours of questioning), as well as the efforts of a group of Internet advocates to "Free the West Memphis Three." Byers is back as well, and he is infinitely more terrifying than anything in Book of Shadows, Berlinger's Blair Witch sequel. We learn that Byers had all his teeth extracted in the years after the murders (human bite marks are among the new evidence introduced). We also learn that his wife has since died of undetermined causes. When Byers passes a suspect lie detector test, he exults, "I knew I was innocent." A further mystery is why both Paradise Lost films have not garnered the media attention or sparked the outrage that attended Errol Morris's The Thin Blue Line, which led to the release of an innocent man who was imprisoned for more than 10 years. Both films give new meaning to the concept of reasonable doubt. --Donald Liebenson --This text refers to the VHS Tape edition.       urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

I offered her a sip - the girl she gave me lip It did begin the stuff wore in and now she's on my tip   Dancing with myself     On the floors of Tokyo Down in London town's a go-go With the record selection And the mirror's reflection I'm a-dancing with myself  Oh, when there's no one else in sight In the crowded, lonely night Well, I wait so long for my love vibration And I'm dancing with myself   You may be right   I've been stranded in the combat zone I walked through Bedford Stuy alone Even rode my motorcycle in the rain And you told me not to drive But I made it home alive So you said that only proves that I'm insane  You may be right I may be crazy But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for Turn out the light Don't try to save me You may be wrong for all I know But you may be right   Boys don't cry   I would say I'm sorry If I thought that it would change your mind But I know that this time I've said too much Been too unkind  I try to laugh about it Cover it all up with lies I try and Laugh about it Hiding the tears in my eyes 'cause boys don't cry Boys don't cry   California Uber Alles   I am Governor Jerry Brown My aura smiles And never frowns Soon I will be president ... Carter power will soon go away I will be Fuhrer one day I will command all of you Your kids will meditate in school California uber alles Uber alles California Zen fascists will control you 100% natural You will jog for the master race And always wear the happy face Close your eyes, can't happen here Big Bro' on white horse is near The hippies won't come back you say Mellow out or you will pay California uber alles Uber alles California   Pour Some Sugar on Me   Step inside, walk this way You and me babe, Hey, hey!

      Since Im trying to finish an freelance article Im working on, I decided to compile a list of movie quotes from some of my favorites movies.  Enjoy!   Star Trek VI Final Frontier    Spock   Logic is the beginning of wisdom; not the end.    Star Trek IV Voyage Home    Kirk    No, I'm from Iowa. I only work in outer space.    Taxi Driver   You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Well, who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? Well, I'm the only one here. Who the f--k do you think you're talkin' to?"    American Pie   Jim:    She's gone! Oh my God! She used me. I was used.   I was used! Cool!   Spaceballs   Dark Helmet:  If there's one thing I despise, it is a fair fight.   Scarface   I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.   Star Wars   Obi-Wan Kenobi:  The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.    Han Solo:  Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.   Yoda:  Yes, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever   Apocolypse Now     Robert Duvall (Kilgore):  You smell that? Do you smell that? ...Napalm, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for twelve hours. When it was all over I walked up. We didn't find one of 'em, not one stinkin' dink body. The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like... victory. Someday this war's gonna end...   Deliverance  Get up, boy. I bet you can squeal. I bet you can squeal like a pig.   Dirty Harry   Clint Eastwood (Harry Callahan):  I know what you're thinking. Did he fire six shots or only five? Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world, and would blow your head clean off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?    Shawshank Redemption   Morgan Freeman (Red): (narrating)  The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing shit they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell... and those bars slam home...that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it. –Shawshank Redemption   Fast Times at Ridgemont High    Mike Damone:  I mean don't just walk in. You move across the room. And you don't talk to her. You use your face. You use your body. You use everything. That's what I do. I mean I just send out this vibe and I have personally found that women do respond. I mean, something happens.  Mark Ratner:  Well, naturally something happens. I mean, you put the vibe out to 30 million chicks, something is gonna happen.  Mike Damone:  That's the idea, Rat. That's the attitude.  Mark Ratner:  The attitude?  Mike Damone:  Yeah! The attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays, or prays. I mean whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. Now when you got that, then you have the attitude.   Mike Damone:  First of all Rat, you never let on how much you like a girl. "Oh, Debbie. Hi." Two, you always call the shots. "Kiss me. You won't regret it." Now three, act like wherever you are, that's the place to be. "Isn't this great?" Four, when ordering food, you find out what she wants, then order for the both of you. It's a classy move. "Now, the lady will have the linguini and white clam sauce, and a Coke with no ice." And five, now this is the most important, Rat. When it comes down to making out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.   Jeff Spicoli:  All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.   The Shinning   Jack Torrance:  Darling. Light, of my life. I'm not gonna hurt ya. You didn't let me finish my sentence. I said, I'm not gonna hurt ya. I'm just gonna bash your brains in. I'm gonna bash 'em right the fuck in. Ha, ha.   Dannny Torrance:  Redrum. Redrum. Redrum.   Clockwork Orange   Alex:  There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and Dim, and we sat in the Korova Milkbar trying to make up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The Korova milkbar sold milk-plus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.   Full Metal Jacket     Sgt. Hartman    [I]'m gonna give you three seconds--exactly three fu**ing seconds--to wipe that stupid lookin' grin off your face, or I will gouge out your  eyeballs and skull fu** you!   Reservoir Dogs (1992)   Mr. Blonde:  Listen kid, I'm not gonna bullshit you, allright? I don't give a good fuck what you know, or don't know, but I'm gonna torture you anyway, regardless. Not to get information. It's amusing, to me, to torture a cop. You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before. All you can do is pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get. (He removes his razor) You ever listen to K-Billy's "Super Sounds of the Seventies" weekend? It's my personal favorite.   Brown:  O.K., let me tell you what Like a Virgin's about. It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine, I'm talking morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.   Mr. Blue:  How many dicks is that?   Mr. White:  A lot.   Mr. Brown:  Then one day she meets this John Holmes motherfucker and it's like, whoa baby, I mean this cat is like Charles Bronson in the Great Escape, he's digging tunnels. Now, she's gettin' the serious dick action and she's feeling something she ain't felt since forever. Pain. Pain. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt her, you know her pussy should be Bubble Yum by now, but when this cat fucks her it hurts. It hurts just like it did the first time. You see the pain is reminding a fuck machine what it once was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a virgin."   Easy Rider   Billy -  You gotta be kidding. I mean, you know who this is, man? This is Captain America. I'm Billy. Hey, we're headliners baby. We played every fair in this part of the country. I mean, for top dollar, too!   Blade Runner   Leon:  Wake up! Time to die!    Roy Batty:  I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.    Gaff:  It's too bad she won't live! But then again, who does?    Rick Deckard:  I was quit when I come in here, Bryant, I'm twice as quit now.   Boyz N da Hood   Furious Styles:  Why is it that there is a gun shop on almost every corner in this community?   The Old Man:  Why?   Furious Styles:  I'll tell you why. For the same reason that there is a liquor store on almost every corner in the black community. Why? They want us to kill ourselves.   Shalika:  Why is it every time you talk about a female you gotta say bitch, ho, or hootchie?   Doughboy:  'Cause that's what you are.  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Commuting my ass to work every day, I have to laugh at some of the bumper stickers.   Rednecks have the best… Rush is Right… Straight and Narrow… all sorts of shit.  Now I don’t have any bumper stickers on my car.  Why?  I think they are a magnet for cops, “hey look at me, pull me over”.  But if I did, here is a list of what they might say…   Enjoy   If You Drink, Don't Park, Accidents Cause People.  If You Can't Dazzle Them With Brilliance, Riddle Them With Bullets  Don't Be Sexist - Broads Hate That  You're Just Jealous Because The Voices Are Talking To Me  Life is sexually transmitted.  Men have feelings too, but who really cares?  I'm looking for true love. But I'll settle for cheap sex.  I don't suffer from insanity - I enjoy every minute of it  If the van's a' rockin, don't come a' knockin  I love my country. It's the government I'm afraid of.   For a small town this one sure has a lot of assholes  My child was inmate of the month at the county jail  If your gonna ride my ass at least pull my hair  Mean people suck, Nice people swallow  Submariners do it deeper  Big Truck, Little Dick  Beam me up Scotty!  My other car is a broomstick  If my smoking bothers you, Don’t breathe!  Beer, helping ugly people have sex since 1862  Embarrasing my children, a full time occupation  I wouldn't laugh mister it could be your daughter in this car.  Dip me in honey and throw me to the lesbians!  I didn't invent Sin, I'm just trying to perfect it.  GOD LOVES YOU!  (but everybody else thinks you're an asshole)  I'm not your type. I'm not inflatable.  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       The Local Pawnshop On a trip to the local pawnshop I decided I needed a video camera.  You know, to cash in on the home porn thang or film various other life events as they wiz by.  Being trashy poor, I thought the pawnshop would be the best place to find a camera.  Ide had good luck there in the past with TV’s and VCR’s.  The pawnshop I frequent is the more upscale kind, sort of like a Supermarket, glass shelves, bright lights, neon signs, and less emphasis on guns (though Im sure they sell them behind the glass counter).  Being a military town/redneck utopia pawnshops in this area get a lot of business.  You can find anything at the pawnshop from electrical appliances to 200 dollar vibrators.      Bling, Bling... a free videotape  After checking out the bling bling selection, I picked out a handy video camera for $50.  It was small, cute, and seemed to be working quite well.  It was mine.  As I was purchasing the camera, the clerk with heavy make-up and long Lee press on nails tells me “look this one comes with a tape”.  Cool, I thought, now I don’t need to buy one to get started.     Home movies  I pressed play on the recorder too see what was on the tape through the viewfinder.  The tape had not been previously blank, but someone had taped over whatever was on it with a blue screen highlighting the phrase “Happy Father Day”.  What the heck, I thought and rewound the blank tape to begin my own home movie adventure.  We started videotaping military battleships, groups of howling sailors, redneck vehicles and other local sites.  With a video camera the possibilities were endless.    Surprise...  As I was rewinding our days worth of amateur movie making, I noticed that there was a catch in the beginning of the tape.  The tape stopped at what seemed like the beginning, but if you hit rewind a couple times it actually rewound a little further.  What I found at the beginning of the tape surprised the shit out of me.  When the previous owner attempted to tape over what had been recorded on the tape, they didn’t cover up the very beginning.  I couldn’t believe what a score this video camera actually was!    Ba-Da-Boom-Ba-Da-Bing  I hooked up the video camera to the TV to get the full effect of this video prize.  To my horror and hysterical delight appeared a naked redneck on the screen.  Sitting on an ugly green couch, near a coffee table littered with empty Bud Light Beer cans, and an ashtray with a lit cigarette, was a Nekid long haired, mullet headed redneck… and he was touchin himself.  YUCK!  It was like a bad train wreck, I had to watch.  The best part was that the redneck was talking to the person holding the camera, and it wasn’t a woman.  The cameraman zooms in and out on the rednecks spankin little monkey while he is obviously getting warmed up and in the mood for sexin.  The tape stops for a second and cuts to the second redneck.  Now he is nekid and the camera is focusing on a close-up of him in live action.  He is hairier and whiter then the first redneck, and it looks as if he is having some problems in the erection department (too much speed???).  The tape then cuts back to the first redneck, and he is going at it, and making a disgusting groaning sound reminiscent from a scene in deliverance.  The tape then stops abruptly, as becomes the blue screen and happy fathers day message.     Rednecks and Deliverance  I laughed so hard I cried… and then showed all my friends (and some strangers too).  I couldn’t believe these rednecks left a tape of themselves masturbating.  I also couldn’t believe these hardcore rednecks were taping each other in the act.  What else did they do to each other nekid that the tape covered up with the Fathers Day message?     Blog This!  You know I would love to post the tape on the Internet for all to see.  What pisses me off the most however, isn’t the fact that two guys are touchin themselves and videotaping it, it’s the fact that these two rednecks are probably homophobic.  These same rednecks probably beat up effeminate locals and harass openly gay and lesbian persons.  Its like that movie, American Beauty, the most homophobic psychopath is really scared of what is inside them.  I would love to OUT these homophobic rednecks and splash their hairy and ugly ass selves in the act of being “very gay”.  Maybe if I ever get good with technology I will do that, any suggestions?  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Maybe Im just a freak, but what is my fascination with the dark side?  Besides adoring the (non) color black, I have always been attracted to the dark characters.  Darth Vader being a prime example,  as his Empires March gives me chills and his quotes serve as wisdom in my life. “Luke, I am your father, join me and we can travel the universe as father and son”  or “The circle is now complete, when I last saw you I was but the learner… Now I am the MASTER!” Luke Skywalker was much too wimpy for me, I mean I really could not stand him, always whining and complaining. No I liked the bad boys, Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and that bad ass drug smuggling wise guy Han Solo (part bad guy/good guy).  I was devastated when Darth Maul was killed off so early in the first Star Wars, I mean, my God he was the coolest character.    Being a collector, I take pride in my collection of Star Wars bounty hunters, wicked X-men characters (such as Magneto) and the McFarlane Toys Movie Monsters (Jason, Leatherface, Freddy Kruger, Michael Meyers, Scream, Normon Bates, etc).  My Spawn figures also litter the house in their reverence to gothic darkness.  These villainous characters shrine my apartment like a wicked homage to the dark side.    In addition to this, I have a black cat, I love dark poetry, I cant stand feel-good movies or melodrama and prefer to watch either horror or action adventures.  My favorite character in the Harry Potter movies is Malfoy (however he’s too evil in the books). The villains always excite me; Rudger Hower is Awesome in Blade Runner, Magneto is my favorite X-men, Cigarette Smoking Man was the coolest on X-files, Kahn was the best in Star Trek wrath of Kahn, Rob from Survivor’s All-star was my hero, and who couldn’t love Dr. Zeus on Planet of the Apes?  Im just a sucker for bad boys, I guess this being my weakness.  I knew I had really lost it when I started having a crush on some of the characters of HBO’s OZ (Jaz Hoyt, Ryan O’Reily).  My original bad boy crush was Matt Dillion and all his 80’s SE Hinton characters.  I am entrigued by Tupak Shakur and Biggie Smalls, I enjoy Howard Stern and Tom Lykus.  Its not that I agree with everything these bad boyz preach, its that I can find humor even in their most sexist remarks.    Jessica Rabbit once said “Im not bad… I was just drawn that way!”  This is a quote I seem to live by.   I like Frenchie in Greese, and find Sandra D to prissy.  I only appreciated the talent of Burt Reynolds when he plays some slimeball like in Boogie Nights.  Sometimes I only like a character when they become tempted by the dark side, or their troubled side.  I like Fox Mulder better when he is spotted walking out of X-rated theaters or caught watching porn.  Frank Black from Millennium was only likable once he started waging his internal battle.  Luke Skywalker finally got some balls by being tempted by the dark side.  Wolverine is definitely coolest when he is raging, and Cat Woman is a sexy bad ass chick who you secretly hope will kick Batman’s ass.    Is it cool to be bad?  Do nice guy’s really finish last?  I cant say the answer to these questions.  At least in my fictional movie starstruck eyes, its good to be bad, and BORING to be good.  Make any sense?    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      I love tweekers…NOT!  Why is it that in mullet infested, white trash town this drug runs rapid like the flu?  Trailer parks, mullets, flannels, bikers, women with teased out high hair styles, missing teeth, Dire Straits, welfare checks and crank, (speed, crystal, tweek) all live together in tweeked out harmony.  Further, what is the connection between white trash and tweek?  Is it the cost effective drug of choice for the bottom dwelling masses?  Not to be harsh, but I fucking HATE tweekers.  I guess Im a drug snob, since Ive been called a “pot head” and I don’t mind ravers and acid heads too much.  Tweekers are just a breed of their own.  I have also seen many a lives ruined from tweeker habbits and behavior.     Tweakers abound...  Upon moving back to my hometown, I discovered that tweekers abound, and that tweek is the name of the game for most of the locals.  How can you tell a tweeker?  Lets see… bad skin, missing teeth, bulging eyes, paranoia, and fast non-stop talking that never seems to have a point, and jumps mid sentence.  Here are some other clues…  Your neighbor spends every night all tinkering in his garage but never seems to get anything accomplished…. Houston we have a problem.      Boy was I stupid  One of my ex-boyfriends went on a tweeker binge once while we were living together.  Me being anti-tweek, and somewhat ignorant to that culture, was completely in the dark and oblivious.  He stopped sleeping when I did, stayed up at night and put together action figure scenes, went on shopping binges for action figures, and talked incessantly at me (or anyone) about action figures.  His skin also broke out and his breath got pretty bad.  I remember a stoner friend coming over and taking me aside and pointing out the obvious.  “He’s fuckin tweekin cant you see that?”  I was shocked, stunned, flabbergasted, and mortified.  Here I thought he was just acting weird.  Boy was I a fool.   Im not in the bedroom club  Another thing about living where I do at the present; everyone pretty much knows you, and everyone pretty much knows your beliefs on tweak.  When I go to a party, people may disappear for a few minutes into the other room (in groups), but they don’t break the shit out in front of me.  Though I do appreciate this fact, it gets quite obvious what they are up to after their third trip to the bedroom.     A visit to a tweaker den  Last weekend I went to a friends house for a quick visit before picking up my son from the skating rink.  There was a poker party in the dinning room and my friend was in the living room with the door closed.  At first I sat down at the poker party, but realized this was a “boys only” scene and decided I should head into the other room.  Just as I was about to enter, a strange looking guy emerged from the back room with a huge backpack and overly active mouth.  “Hey guys looks like fun” he quipped, as he headed out the door.  “Who was that?” I asked the poker table.  “Who knows” was the reply.  I knocked on the back door to say hi to my friend.  Quickly the door was answered and I was greeted by hugs and smiles.  I guess I should be familiar with the smell of tweak, but I have too say I am not.  Im just not around it that much.  There was a strange smell in the air, but I took it for brown weed.  My friend looked normal, only she was chewing gum REALLY fast.  I also noticed there was no munchies out on the table, and the usual bong load was non-existant.  My friend’s boyfriend is bipolar (and a genius) so he always talks really fast and deep.  He came down the stairs and started talking at me really fast, and then slips (she’s gonna think Im tweekin).  I thought this was a strange thing to pipe in unless you really are tweakin.  Then, Im trying to talk to my friend, and some strange man in the chair screams out, in a Turrets syndrome fashion “Im Bored”.  I tried to ignore him, but obviously he wanted to talk, so though my back was turned and eyes were rolling, he starts ranting about his girlfriend.  Then he decides to take a walk (mind you its 10:00 at night, who walks at that hour?).  Luckily, it was my time to go, my ear was talked off and I was starting to feel brain friend.  The next day another friend of mine who was at the poker party says “boy they were tweakin in the other room”.  I say “really, I didn’t know”.  He says “yeah first thing they did when I got there was take me in the back room and offer to sell me some crystal”.  Well, they didn’t offer me any.  I don’t know whether to take that as a compliment, or an insult.  I chose to take it as a compliment, Im glad tweekers know I aint one of them.  I don’t want to end up lookin like Im 65 when Im 35 and loosing all my teeth.   Plus, Tweekers suck!   urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Living in sailor/redneck infested mulletown, one doesn’t get the opportunity to hang with  Rock Stars  as you might in the big city.  Rock stars tend to avoid these parts, unless you count pre-fame shows in garages or venues played while on some crackerjack tour.  In lieu of the absence of real rock stars, small town big shots emerge and try desperately to play the part.  (You know the whole big fish small pond thang).  In these parts, one can gain “Rock Star” status for the smallest link or 15 mins of fame.  She is the sister of the cousin whose girlfriend is dating so-in-so rock star, or his face appeared in the crowd shot of this rock star video, or he was the toilet-paper-getter roadie for the tour of this band, or his band opened for a festival with 100 bands and these rock stars were on the billet.  It goes on, and on.  In a town like this normal folk can achieve rock star status for just about anything trite thing; such as running a successful tattoo parlor, winning a local D-Derby competition, or being a regular player at the local juke-joint taverns.  I find this all to be very amusing.  Especially when these characters start acting all effected, wearing sun glasses at night, accumulating a fan club, talking at you, and making appearances to further spread their local fame.    I ignore these local clowns, unless I happen to know them, and of course, I honor them by saying “what’s up Rock Star!”.  (I use my most patronizing voice when I say this).  I really cant stand the rock star attitude, even when its coming from actual rock stars.  Be yourself please, don’t try to impress everyone.   When I used to live in the Bay Area, I happened upon a band who achieved fame in the pop punk circle.  (I won’t mention the name, because I don’t want to name drop)  Through a boyfriend I was living with at the time, I became “accepted” into the inner circle of this band.  This meant full-fledged membership into their entourage, exclusive rock star parties, back stage passes, and rock-n-roll appearances at local shows.  Now these guys were gutter punks that happened to strike it rich.  It was funny to me that punk rockers could be rich at the same time, (and still try to be punk), but hey, who was I to judge.  This elite membership in their group awarded me all sorts of privileges, and it was funny to me how people changed when they were around.  The rock starts themselves were a strange group of guys, very affected by their fame and MONEY, but most affected by how other would treat them.  Kinda like that Joe Walsh song “Life’s been good to me so far”.  Everyone changes from fame, the ones who get famous, and mostly the people around them.  For example, I would walk into a party by myself, and no one would say hi, or have anything to do with me.  I show up at the same party, 15 minutes later with rock stars in tow, and all of a sudden, Im someone, everyone wants to say hi to me, and make some sort of stupid conversation.  Like I was born yesterday, I knew what time it was.  They all wanted to stand near me to try to get their conversation in with the rock star.  This was totally annoying.   The rock stars themselves were nice, if you got them one-on-one, but in a group they became this personality who would talk at the crowd and tell the same tired ass stories all over again.  It got old, even more so when you have your friends and family bugging you for things like backstage passes, autographs, or personal photos.    Back to small town life, where real rock stars are few and far between, and local yokels will try to immortalize you in local fame “just for touching a real rock star”.  Luckily too, this local fame fades, as its been at least six months since some idiot has reminded me that “I used to hang out with” the real rock stars.  It just to be “hey this is vadergrrrl and she knows _______________”.  Luckily more, my teenage son could care less about hanging with the real rock stars.  Though he has been to their mansions and birthday parties with their offspring, he could care less.  He isn’t a fan of poppy punk, or any punk rock, and knowing those rock stars is totally un-cool to him.  When I mention to one of his friends that we know them, they say “who?”  I find this amusing as in the 90’s they were the biggest thing since sliced Wonder bread.  Yes, to this new gang of teenagers if your not P-Ditty or Nate Dawg, you aint cool sucka.  I think however, that the real rock stars are you, me, and anyone who has survived this bitch called life.  Just because you were in the right place at the right time, or your daddy knew someone, or what not, this does not mean you are more talented or deserving than any of the rest of us.  In fact the most talented individuals I have ever met, are broke ass poor struggling artists, like myself.  All those lucky bastards who achieved fame and riches are just plain that… lucky bastards.   I also think its time to spread the wealth, and let the real deal Hollyfield talents, such as you and I, get some of that cash.   Yes a fantasy, but would be nice, and heck… One can dream….  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Whatever your take or beliefs are in astrology, its still kinda freaky how dead on it can be.  I do think that the universe and placement of the stars has an effect on our personalities.  Obviously, the Carl Sagan cosmos have an effect on our earth, look at the moon and our tides, or the end of the dinosaurs.  I find astrology fascinating, and in my case startlingly accurate.   Lets look at what astrology says about me, my sign, the famous fish… Pisces.   urlLink Café Astrology    Pisces: Keywords: intuitive, dreamy, artistic, humane, sympathetic, sensitive, compassionate, perceptive, tender, impressionable    -This all sounds like me none more than the other.  I definitely represent these attributes.     Sun in Pisces people are frequently pegged as wishy-washy, but this is all a matter of opinion. What you will find behind a vaguely directionless, spacey manner is a deep person with real dreams.    --Thanks for acknowledging that Im spacey.  I hated being called “space cadet” in junior high.  I do have dreams, and my head is often dreaming in space.  All true.      A deep love for humanity, and compassion that knows no bounds.     ---I am compassionate, almost too much sometimes.  I hate to be a “doormat”.    Their imagination, attunement to humanity, and remarkable intuition endow them with enviable gifts of insight and creativity.    --Cool this makes me psychic and creative.  Except when I have that damn writers block.     Pisces is a sensitive sign--both sensitive to criticism and sensitive to others' feelings. They believe in people, are deeply hurt by compassionless human behavior, and have a hard time saying no.    --“Im just a girl who can’t say no… Im in a terrible fix”  LOL     Some might even wonder if Pisces finds pleasure in suffering. Sometimes this is the case, but most of the time, Pisces pulls a lot of creative energy from sadness. Pisces is the poet or artist with angst.    --I don’t find pleasure in suffering, but I do find a lot of creative energy when I depressed.  Most of my poetry has stemmed from depression periods.  I actually have a very difficult time writing a “happy” poem.     Some find Pisces' tendency to be late for appointments, spaced out behavior, and absent-mindedness amount to irresponsibility. Many Pisces seem almost allergic to things like shopping lists, maps, directions, and instructions, and for some brave souls, even watches -- they prefer to feel their way through life than to follow some plan.    --I am late to work everyday, I miss a lot of appointments, I can be called flaky.  Have you guys ever seen the movie “Easy Rider” where Captain America takes off his watch to live on his own time?  I haven’t worn a watch since I saw that movie several years ago.  I prefer not to have a clock in my bedroom either.  I hate being controlled by the time.     We find plenty of artists, poets, and musicians with Sun (and other personal planets) in Pisces. Piscean themes are woven throughout the songs of Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, for example.  -- Cool, cool.      Quotes from Famous Pisceans  "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."  -- Michelangelo (Sun in Pisces, Moon in Pisces, Mars in Pisces)  "I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." -- Albert Einstein (Sun in Pisces) "The only abnormality is the incapacity to love." -- Anais Nin (Sun and Venus in Pisces)     Some Famous People with Sun in Pisces: Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Mars in Pisces), Drew Barrymore (Sun and Venus in Pisces), Kurt Cobain (Sun, Mercury, and Venus in Pisces), Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, Cindy Crawford, Billy Crystal (Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Pisces), Albert Einstein, George Harrison, Kato Kaelin (Sun and Moon in Pisces), Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze Jr., Michelangelo, Aidan Quinn (Sun and Moon in Pisces), Rob Reiner (Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Pisces), Dr. Seuss, Sharon Stone, Elizabeth Taylor (Sun, Mercury, and Mars in Pisces), Bruce Willis    urlLink Free chart!

       A thought that sometimes makes me hazy: Am I - or are the others crazy?  -Albert Einstein   “Crazy, Im crazy for feelin so lonely….”,  “Im goin off the rails on a crazy train…” These are some of my favorite lyrics to songs that touch a nerve in my head.   I have always felt, different, or crazy.  Sometimes my mind just races too damn fast.  Ooops, did I take my meds today?  Just pop another pill, smoke another cigarette, drink another glass of wine, smoke another toke…. And Im fine for the day.  “your one crazy ass chick” I sometimes here, or “girl you so crazy”.  But I really believe there is a fine line between insanity and genius.  It seems like so many of us creative artist types also battle depression or other emotional demons.   I have met some people diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar, and its funny how these people are also very brilliant.  Great poets, writers, thinkers, their minds just spin so fast, as if on speed.  I am clinically depressed at times, Im borderline ADD, and a bit dyslexic.  Sometimes my mind races soooooo damn fast, but then at these times I am able to create, write poetry, read, etc.  Other times, Im heavy, tired, and so overwhelmed that all I want to do is sleep all day.   I wonder what the connection is between genius and insanity?  I looked up the definition for crazy and found this.   urlLink From your dictionary.net   The noun "crazy" has 1 senses.  1. crazy, loony, looney, weirdo -- someone deranged and possibly dangerous     The adjective "crazy" has 6 senses.  1. brainsick, crazy, demented, distracted, disturbed, mad, sick, unbalanced, unhinged -- affected with madness or insanity; "a man who had gone mad 2. crazy, half-baked, screwball, softheaded, meshuga, meshugge -- (informal) foolish; totally unsound; "an impractical solution"; "a crazy scheme"; "half-baked ideas"; "a screwball proposal without a prayer of working"  3. crazy, dotty, gaga, enamored, infatuated, in love, smitten, soft on, taken with -- marked by foolish or unreasoning fondness; "she was crazy about him"; "gaga over the rock group's new album"; "he was infatuated with her"   4. crazy -- (informal) possessed by inordinate excitement; "the crowd went crazy"; "was crazy to try his new bicycle"  5. crazy -- bizarre or fantastic; "had a crazy dream"; "wore a crazy hat"  6. crazy -- (informal) intensely enthusiastic about or preoccupied with; "crazy about cars and racing"  "    -I really like the “someone deranged and possibly dangerous” bit.  Yes, that definitely describes me.  LOL  I looked up genius and found this   The noun "genius" has 5 senses.  1. genius, mastermind, brain -- someone who has exceptional intellectual ability and originality  2. brilliance, genius -- unusual mental ability  3. ace, adept, sensation, maven, virtuoso, genius, hotshot, star, whiz, whizz, wizard, wiz -- someone who is dazzlingly skilled in any field  4. genius, wizardry -- exceptional creative ability  5. flair, genius -- a natural talent; "he has a flair for mathematics"; "he has a genius for interior decorating"    I found a book that discusses this on Amazon.  Its editorial read:   What is the connection between genius and madness? IBM-based polymath Clifford Pickover approaches the question in a characteristically eclectic way. First he looks at the lives of a collection of eccentric scientists, from Nikolai Tesla to the Unabomber, giving each a name ("The Fly Man from Galway"; "The Rat Man from London") deliberately reminiscent of Sigmund Freud's names for his cases. Then Pickover discusses obsessive-compulsive disorder and the relationship between brain structure and genius   ----Hmmmm, maybe Im not crazy, maybe Im just a genius.  Or maybe Im just one wild-ass crazy chick.  Who knows.  It seems however, that a lot of our most influential contributors to society have been deemed crazy.   I searched the web and found a quiz to see if your one crazy ass artist.   Do you struggle with understanding why everyone else just doesn't "get it?"  Are you an emotionally intense person?  Do you see yourself as an artist, an intellectual, a creative, an intuitive?  Do you live in another world than most people on the planet? Do you have unique abilities? Have you been diagnosed with clinical depression, manic depression, ADHD, or some other mental illness and traditional treatments do not seem to address the problems? Do you feel like no one understands you? Have you tested extremely high (98 percentile or above) on traditional and/or multidimensional IQ/EQ tests?  Does your life seem to be ruled by the creativity and emotion that is so prevalent within you? Do you have a rich and exciting inner life that you have found difficult to share with others? Do you have an insatiable 'need to know' that no one understands?    urlLink Creative Genius   Let me answer some of these questions here.    Do you struggle with understanding why everyone else just doesn't "get it?"  --Yes everyday.  What is wrong with YOU people!     Are you an emotionally intense person?  --I think others would say so.  I definitely like to make a statement and get out my opinions.    Do you see yourself as an artist, an intellectual, a creative, an intuitive?  --I definitely consider myself the tragic artist/writer/poet   Do you live in another world than most people on the planet? -Yes I live on Tatooine “Never a more hive of scum and villainy”   Do you have unique abilities? --Im a little psychic… or just psycho lol   Have you been diagnosed with clinical depression, manic depression, ADHD, or some other mental illness and traditional treatments do not seem to address the problems? --Gee thanks for reminding me.  But my meds do seem to be working, today.    Do you feel like no one understands you? --No one does understand me!     Have you tested extremely high (98 percentile or above) on traditional and/or multidimensional IQ/EQ tests?   --Yes and graduated top 3% of UC Berkeley class 1996   Does your life seem to be ruled by the creativity and emotion that is so prevalent within you?  ---Yes and by PASSION too   Do you have a rich and exciting inner life that you have found difficult to share with others? --I don’t know about this.  I don’t here voices (anymore)   Do you have an insatiable 'need to know' that no one understands?  -No just an insatiable need for sex…. LOL   Well I guess I pass this crazy test.   Here is more information on famous “crazies” like myself.   It seems a lot of people I am influenced by were considered crazy too.  Sylvia Plath (author eventually committed suicide) Winston Churchill and his 'black dog' of depression Van Gogh (most famous 'schizophrenic') Paul Merton (comedian who had breakdown just as getting famous. Seeing self on tv fuelled paranoia) John Cleese(self confessed manic) Ernest Hemmingway (reckons ECT stole his writing gift) Joan of Arc (burned to death for hearing voices) Alistair Campbell (Blair's right hand man. Blames breakdown on the booze)  And the list goes on…..  Our greatest blessings come to us by way of madness.. -Socrates   Many persons become poets, prophets, and sibyls, and, like Marcus the Syracusan, are pretty good poets while they are maniacal; but when cured can no longer write verse. -Aristotle   Here is another link regarding crazy ass genius’s.  This site  lists Edgar Allen Poe, Socrates,  and Leonardo DaVinci as being crazy.  urlLink crazy ass genius's     urlLink Famous Crazy Folks   We’re in Good Company: almost 300 names of well known people who have a psychiatric diagnosis of mental illness. Almost no one was "Glad" to be their friend until they became famous. Ludwig van Beethoven, composer Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), general Charles Darwin Mozart, composer Marilyn Monroe, actress Anne Sexton, poet, 20th century James Taylor, singer popular 1990 Walt Whitman, poet   Are we CRAZY or is everyone else just ASLEEP?!

      Well sometimes vodka and I do not mix.  Ever see that movie with Bruce Willis, blind date?  Kim Bassinger acts all crazy when she drinks and does some wacky things?  Well that was kinda me the other night, or any night I go out and whup it up.  Vadergrrrl becomes a crazy ass girl.   So, my teenage jock son was spending the evening away at some baseball team male bonding night.  I’m thinkin I’m free, time to party on like Garth.  I have a few glasses of wine at my house to get myself in the mood for a night out on the town.  Now, mind you in my hometown a  “night on the town” consist of choosing from various old man bars, to redneck jukebox pool halls, to sailor meat market dancin, to live townie music venues, to townie karayoke fest.  We kinda managed to do all of the above, and I made sure and drank at every stop.   Now, mind you, I think the townie music is good, I even enjoy the bands that come from Seattle.  I think however that after being the girlfriend of a local musician for a couple years (my last boyfriend)  burned me out on that scene.  But that is for another story.  Back to last night.    Bar #1 and tattoo parlor hell raisin   After drinking the wine to get myself ready, I head down to the first stop, the local bar that features northwestern alternative-ish music.  The bank hasn’t started playing yet, so I avoid paying a cover at the door (this makes a big difference when you are broke).  So I get to the bar and have a couple vodka (double) and redbulls.  I’m feeling rather lit, and happy, when my friend decides to get pierced.  Her other friend had her chin pierced earlier that day.  We all load up, and decide to head to the tattoo parlor.  We stop at a tattoo parlor opened by a friend of mine.  He wasn’t there, so I “name dropped” upon entering and said my friend wanted her “clitoris pierced”.  Of course, she wanted her lip pierced (on her face), but I, feeling rather buzzed, continued to make jokes anyway.  See, this obnoxious character sometimes comes out of me, a wild child who could give a fuck what other people think of her.  While my friend was pierced, my mouth was goin and goin.  We flirted with the tattooed and pierced guys and then proceeded to move onto another bar.     Bar hoppin crazy train  This bar was the old man bar, mullets were hanging out everywhere with a tiny scattering of sailors.  I had another drink and began yelling “its flash Friday” in the bar and enticing my friends to flash the mullet heads.  A couple flashed us (AHHHHHHH)  and we flashed the bar (but towards the wall where no one was sitting except a couple Bremolos who pretend not to the spectacle).  So, not enough excitement there for us, and we decided to try another bar.  We arrive at the bar (I had never been to before and had been rumored the Banditos biker gang hangs out at).  This bar has a line out front with girls scantily clad, and a couple of guys in cowboy hats all waiting to go inside.  We decide we will never patronage a bar in this town that keeps us waiting out front (Don’t they know who WE are???), so we decide to go to the sailor meat market dance club.  Here I have 2 more drinks and do a little dancing with my friends and talking to a couple guys who went to school in the area when I did.  We played the ol’ “do you know so-in-so game”. I was officially drunk at this point, but having fun, and talking up a storm.  We decided to go back to the bar with the line out front.  When we get back there was no line so we go in to find a Karayoke party.  I have two more drinks here.  In between Karayoke, the dj plays hip-hop top 40 and we dance.  We dance to a couple’s rendition of John Travolta and Olivia Newton John’s Summer Lovin that included graphic sexual descriptions. I decide to sing Karayoke and pick the Dyvinals "I touch myself” When my name is called I get up there and started dancing and touching my breasts, and thighs, and getting all nasty and crazy.  I also insert “when I think about your cock I touch myself” Yes, I was makin a spectacle.  I later danced with some townie in a flannel that my friend picked up.  We were all three dancing together and I’m wackin my friend and the townie on the ass, we sandwiched the townie, and then I grabbed his privates.  Luckily the night was ending after this, my friend took the townie home for a night of talking, and I hung out with my computer geek friend eating pasta and doing computer fun until I sobered up enough to drive.    I fucked up!  Hungover like hell,  I slept the next day until 5:00.  Missed my son’s baseball game, flaked on a bunch of commitments, and basically spent the day recovering.  I definitely feel like shit, even somewhat depressed for being such a wild thang, actin a fool, and then flaking on the world the next day.  I may be too old for this shit, I dunno,  It also never ceases to amaze me how crazy I act, golly gee wilikers.  Egads!  I have to laugh at myself, but I still can’t believe how I acted.   I think I will be staying away from vodka for a while.  I need to quit smoking too.   I love the hang over depression days….  You question a lot about yourself the next day.   Oh well, onward upward.  Cheers (with water)!    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Turn on your headlights baby and I’ll show you mine….  The theme for Leykis 101 followers for Flash Friday.  Living in a military town, I have seen military vehicles driving in caravans and hanging flyers off the side that read “FLASH FRIDAY”!  A former boyfriend of mine once chastised me for not supporting the cause.  “Come on” he prodded “Its for OUR boys”.  So what is that supposed to mean?  Because OUR boys are fighting for our country I should FLASH them upon request?  This is the same mentality as my friend Tammy having online sex with a GI in Iraq (who is married) because she says “Im doing it for the troups”.  First of all, I think it would be kinda difficult to drive down the highway and flash someone your boobies while trying to drive a car.  One would have to basically go topless down the street to achieve the desired effect.  And second, I think I would have to have a good buzz going to be brave enough to expose myself in public, and that would not be too safe if I were driving.    For those of you unfamiliar with Leykis here is a link to his site.   urlLink Tom    I also copied some information about Flash Friday from his website.   “” The Tom Leykis Show," syndicated from L.A. since 1994, has developed some trademark schticks as it has nurtured an audience. First there's "Flash Fridays," which has led female fans to "show" their appreciation for the program. "Strangely enough, it began as an homage to [radio raconteur] Jean Shepherd, who once asked people to flash their house lights to verify his late-night audience," says Leykis, who initiated Flash Fridays by asking listeners to turn on their headlights during the end-of-the-week program. And then came the displays, first on the road, then on-the-road. "During one of our stage shows there were ten arrests for nudity," he recalls. One stage-broadcast program took the form of a pub crawl: "By the time the cops got to one location, we'd moved!"    Let me clear the record, I have no problem with Flash Friday.  Heck, if people want to endulge by all means, DO IT.  I just fear the thought of driving down the road with my headlights on and some ugly ass FAT Bremelo flashin me something I REALLY don’t want to see.  I also think it should go both ways, now can we say if I stick my car atenta up on Fridays it means I want to see your willy (not the bannana in your pocket but if you really LIKE me)?  Hey that would be nice, but I could see it having a disasterous effect where I live.  Mulletts with rednecks exposing themselves, well wait a second, that probably happens every day here….    HAPPY FLASH FRIDAY, and If anyone reading this sees me driving down the road, hey turn on your lights, I may SURPRISE YOU!    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Its great seeing the Beastie Boys coming out with a new album.  (Notice Im dating myself here by using the term “album”, I guess I should embrace the new millenium and say “CD”).  I have loved the Beastie Boys ever since I first heard them back in my high school days, fighting for my right to party.  AdRock was my favorite, I thought he epitomized the cute skater-boy look.  When I found out he was dating 80’s It girl Molly Ringwald I was so jealous….  How dare he, didn’t he know I was waiting to turn 18 and marry him?  I played the hell out of my Beastie Boys and Run DMC cassette tapes, memorizing the lyrics, and be-bopping around to the funky rhythms.  When I discovered that Beastie Boys and Run DMC were coming on tour, I HAD to see them, I HAD to meet them.  This was to be my second concert ever, and definitely one of my most memorable of all time.    Using allowance and babysitting money, my friend Michelle and I anxiously purchased tickets from our local record store.  This was the “Raising Hell” tour, and as it was summer we were not in school.  We dressed in matching white shorts, Natural Selection t-shirts, white keds without laces, and cute hair ties, yes we looked like the typical 80’s teenyboppers.  After taking the ferry from Bremerton to Seattle, we arrived early at the famed Paramount theater.  One of the other early “fans” came screaming with great news.  “You can exchange your tickets for closer ones at the ticket window”.  We gasped, clutching each other with excitement as we exchanged our back row seats for seats in the 5th row.  When they opened the doors to the theater, seeing how we were one of the first in line, we were also lucky enough to be the first to get inside.  What magical person appeared before our eyes, but MCA, walking backstage via the front of the theater.  We almost screamed and wet our pants.  I had to act fast, this was our chance.  “MCA can we get a hug” I asked in my best tenny bopper fan voice.  He looked at us as if we were stray puppies and waved his hand “ah get out of here”.  “Please” I begged some more, this time more pathetically “Your our FAVORITE Beastie Boy” (of course this was a lie because we loved Adrock).  He stopped, took another look at us and with the love of God said “okay, but don’t tell anybody”.  With that he hugged us both, quick, let me get this over with fast hugs, but still hugs no less.  What heaven, an actual star… touching us!  Though we were both innocent virgins, and not even close to being groupies, we decided our next ploy was to get backstage, or hang out with them after the show.  Who wouldn’t want to lose their virginity to a rock star?    The concert was amazing (and that’s an understatement)! We were close enough to have water splashed on us (or spit for that matter).  We sang, we dance, we cried, we were definitely in love.  RunDMC stole the show (the veteran performers) and we were delighted when the Beastie Boys joined RunDMC on stage for the concerts finale “Walk this Way”.   We hoped so bad to end up like the lucky girl in the song “Shes Crafty” who ends up backstage and gets to go home with the band.  After the show we were waiting around the back hoping to get an invitation, filled with adrenaline and excitement, and some boys approached us and invited us to an after party at the neighboring hotel.  The party was going to be an exclusive Beastie Boys after party, that would include the Beastie Boys themselves!  We jumped at the invitation, unable to believe our luck.  We get to the party and are immediately served alcohol and cigarettes.   The drinks kept flowing, and we, excited to meet our Loves, kept drinking in anticipation.  After a while, I began to notice that we were the only girls in the hotel room, and the room seemed to be filled with guys.   There was at least 15 guys there, all getting drunk and eyeballing us lecherously.  A few of the guys moved to the bed, got comfortable and invited us to sit down.  Luckily, I wasn’t that drunk, and I started to get suspicious.  “Where are the Beastie Boys?” I asked flatly.  We started getting responses from shrugs, to there coming, to “don’t you worry about them, have another drink”.  After another hour of waiting, and being put off, I got smart and realized this might not be the safest situation for us two underage girls.  The Beastie Boys were not coming, they were probably never going to come, and we needed to get out of there.  Avoiding an inevitable date rape train, we narrowly escaped into a cab outside where Michelle proceeded to puke all over the sidewalk.  Talk about naivete!  Though we didn’t loose our cherries to the Beastie Boys, we were pretty damn close to loosing it to a bunch of horny guys.    In the years to come I would have more adventure with the Beastie Boys.  This includes my infamous car accident into a rock wall while turning up the radio to hear “Paul Revere”.  I have seen the Beasties in concert at least 4 times since the “Raising Hell” tour, and each show has been Fabulous.  At one Lalapalooza in SF I decided to try to hang in the crowd and run in the mosh pit.  This will be the last time I attempt anything so daring.  It seems at these big venues the frat boys decide that the mosh pit is the place to sexually assault women.  I have never been so grabbed, touched, assaulted and fondled over by a crowd in my life.  Big lesson learned... avoid mosh pits at large venue events.  I cant wait to see the Beastie Boys in concert again, maybe this time I can take my 14 year old son.  He would just love it if I pulled a groupie move and flashed the band my tits (NOT).  But it would be a blast to see them again, they do put on a great show, even if it does get me in a little trouble.    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Having lived and been single in both a redneck/sailor hoppin small town vs. a kickin urban area (like Seattle, DC, San Francisco) I have found there to be a major difference in the types of sluts, or what even constitutes a slut in these places.     Small town sluts.   These girls generally suffer from “looking for daddy syndrome”, i.e. they are missing the father figure in their life and look to cheap sex for attention.  Small town sluts can also be lonely or bored wives, typically heavyset and somewhat unattractive, who turn to sex as validation for their visual shortcomings.  Small town sluts can also be the beautiful small town girl who is in constant need for attention and validation.  Small town sluts can often have a drug problem, or at least a weakness for methamphetamine powders.  Small town sluts frequent the same bar until they have slept with too many of the regulars and need to “move on”.  The wardrobes for a small town slut consists of tight jeans, low-cut blouse, open toed sandals with “fuck me” heals, heavily hairsprayed and teased hair, dark lipstick, and long acrylic nails.   Small town sluts generally feel bad about being a slut and consider the word offensive.  Let me give some examples of a small town slut.  My friend Mary, who is a married navy wife gets an “itch” every time her hubby is at sea.  She calls up Eunice and pressures her to go out cattin.  Mary and Eunice dress to the nines, get all shaved and waxed, and head to the bar.  Mary proceeds to make Eunice look like a prude (which is hard to do) by making out with 3 different guys on the dance floor, inviting 2 of them back to Eunice’s for an after party, and sleeping with both.  Mary carries on affairs with various sailors and townies until hubby returns, only to discover she is pregnant and has to abort the baby (since she doesn’t know who the father is).  Mary already has two kids from two different sailors (she actually married both because she was pregnant).    Popular Culture equivalent – Mystic Pizza   Urban Sluts.   Now these chicks cultivate and reclaim the world slut.  Their experiences include both genders and multiple numbers.  They come from diverse backgrounds and generally think of sex in a casual way, separating it from love or any type of attachment.  Urban sluts are not easily recognizable, and at times it seems like everyone and anyone may be an urban slut, if not in practice than in preaching.  It is not uncommon to be at a Fetish club and find that the only non-urban sluts there to be the employees working as dominatrixes and strippers.  Urban sluts have a variety of places to mix, hang out and socialize.  They love art, film, adult entertainment, Stranger personal adds, fine wine and literature.  Hanging out with them you feel prude for being in a monogomous relationship. Urban Sluts are proud to be called sluts, and will even call themselves or other friends “sluts” in casual conversation.  I will give you some examples.  My friend Allison loved sex, had her tongue pierced, and also decided to try bisexuality while majoring in Women Studies at Berkeley.  Having too many lovers to count, Allison loved to talk dirty to whoever and whomever, and always promised that she could do things sexually that other girls were ashamed or too scared to do.  Allison had been having an affair with a boy, Orion, who also loved sex and had slept with many of Allison’s friends.  One night, Allison and Orion ran into each other at a bar, Allison was with her friend Kristen.  Both Kristen and Allison decided they wanted Orion, so they made a promise to him that they would take him back home and have a threesome.  That is what they did, and bragged to whomever about.  Both Kristen and Allison continued to have flings and “private parties” with each other and “lucky men” throughout that semester.  Allison was proud to be a slut, and had stories of seducing teachers, boyfriends, fathers, and sisters alike.    Popular Culture equivalent – Sex in the City    What is a SLUT?  I found this site that says it all.  Being a slut may be a fad or a lifestyle.  I tend to think of it as a mindframe or choice.  I think it is good to be in love and monogomous.  But, if you are single, go rock your socks off, have fun, and yeah women can be "studs" too.    Definitions of Slut   urlLink Zen Slut   From Zenslut.com  (note: links go to definitions at dictionary.com, though i pulled the definitions from my desktop dictionary.) slut [slut] n.: 1. a dirty, slovenly woman. 2. a sexually promiscuous woman --slut'tish adj. that definition being filled with a few adjectives of its own, i looked some of them up for better context: dirty [dirt' y] adj. -i-er -i-est 1. not clean. 2. obscene. 3. contemptable or nasty. 4. unfair; dishonest. 5. rough, as weather. -vt., vi. dirt'ied, dirt'y-ing to make or become dirty -dirt'i-ness n. sloven adj. a careless, untidy person. -slov'en-ly, -lier, -liest, adj promiscuous adj. 1. consisting of different elements indiscriminantly mingled. 2. characterized by a lack of discrimination, esp. in sexual liasons -prom-is-cu-i-it-y, pl. -ities, n. -pro-mis'cu-ous-ly adv.  This is from Zen Slut.com - I didnt write it, but I agree totally  as a woman who challenges society's baggage around the word "slut," and readily embraces it, i would like to offer a different interpretation of the word. i propose that a slut is a sexually empowered woman. a slut is a woman who embraces her sexuality and refuses to let anyone else own it but herself. a slut is a woman who enjoys her sexuality, REVELS in her sexuality, and fucks as her wont is will. she is NOT indiscriminate; to the contrary, she choses only to sleep with people who respect her choices, and her ultimate authority over her own body. she won't sleep with just anybody, but only with people who deserve to share in the awesome sexual power she possesses. she is NOT ashamed; she is powerful, proud, righteous, and deserving of R-E-S-P-E-C-T. how do you know if you're a slut? you're a slut if YOU say you are. it can be an empowering word when it is applied to oneself out of respect for the power of one's sexuality, rather than slurred as an epitaph by a jilted lover. the more of us women (and, hell, men) who embrace the word with a positive connotation, the closer we get to living in a society that values the power of female sexuality as equally as it values male sexuality. if you ever find yourself in a situation where someone is slinging the label "slut" at you as if it's something you should be ashamed of, tell them "thank you," and smile when you say it. i do.    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      My male friend told me recently that he got in some trouble for reading my blog.  According to his wife, by him reading my rantings it was “unhealthy” and a sure sign that I “wanted” him.  Well gee, this is news to me, since I have been hoping to expand my readership and I guess this would make me one horney ass chick.  Now the question…. Do I want everyone who reads or visits my site?  I admit to being an attention whore, but as to being a plain whore, I at least hope not.  So just to make it clear to any wives, girlfriends, boyfriends, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, pets, etc, who happen to suspect that my site is some ploy to get sex….. That Aint it! A big PLEASE… with the palm of my hand in air.     Broke as a bad joke  I always said I would give up being punk rock when I got money (this was in my twenties).  Never thought I would still be punk rock in my thirties (sigh).  Im so tired of having to count change, borrow from Peter to pay Paul, max out credit cards, write checks hoping the wont clear til payday.  My ex husband owes me child support, but I cant seem to get a hold of the guy.  He has been good about it lately (well since Alameda County DA threatened him with 30plus days in an Oakland jail), but Im always stressed while waiting to hear back from him.  Wish I didn’t need the money so bad, but dammit these teenagers are expensive, always needing money for this or that.  Im just really pissy because Im broke today.      urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      I just found the funniest advice on "Dating a Sailor"  I had to post it here after my rant.  I will also post some tips for "Dating a Redneck". What is the difference between dating a sailor v. dating a redneck?  Well, to be honest a sailor may be a redneck, and just be in the navy.  But living in a town madeup of either rednecks or sailors I would have to say there are some stark differences.  1. The hair cut.  Sailors have short hair.  Rednecks have mullets, outdated scott bayo hairsyles, or long biker hair 2. Both trained with guns.  Rednecks hunt animals and have gun racks in there pick up trucks.  Sailors hunt young girls and have a blanket in the back of their cars with a box of condoms. 3.Both like Beer.  Both like to fight.  Both may be strangely addicted to porn. 4.Rednecks can travel solo, and are typically seen hanging out at their favorite bar stool.  Sailors travel in packs, especially to bars.  5.Sailors leave to go out to sea.  Rednecks never leave, nor do they ever get rid of anything.  (Notice the cinderblock, various engines, and major appliances left outside their trailor.)   Anyway, here is what the tips for dating a sailor and below will be tips for redneck dating  How to Pick up a Sailor  1.   It doesn't take much - wear something skimpy. Remember these men haven't seen a woman for possibly months on end.         2.   As a U.S. Navy sailor, I can tell you that having a relationship with a sailor is no different than with anyone else in the world.         3.   Ask them if they're married!  Keep in mind that many of these sailors have wives and children at home who are very easily left out of conversation. I'm a Navy wife and have heard many horror stories.         4.   Realize what is involved in a Navy relationship.  Take into consideration the time you will spend alone during deployments (6 months or more sometimes) and the frequent relocating.         5.   Just be a woman  Some sailors that I've known will enjoy the company of any semi-attractive woman who talks to them.         6.   Ask them where they've been...    Ask him which countries he has been to since he joined up. It's always good to compare notes on destinations that you've both been to.         7.   Be careful   Most sailors are players and are looking for one night stands. Don't expect to have a relationship with them. Also, if you're lucky enough to get into a relationship with them, join a wive's club and find out exactly what it means to date a military man.            The Auburn Guide To Dating Etiquette   1. Do not enter your aubie date in a female mud-wrestling contest without asking her permission. 2. Do not refer to your hunting dog as "the other woman in your life."  3. Do not mention your UFO abduction experiences until at least the third date.  4. Do not expect a woman wearing a dress to be happy about climbing into a truck with tires that are taller than she is. Be sure to warn her to wear jeans.  5. Your favorite faded Dukes of Hazard t-shirt should be saved for the fifth or more date, unless, of course, it's the only clean shirt you have.  6. If the aubie woman drives, never, ever try to get away with spitting tobacco down the side of your seat on the hope that she won't notice. She's not like your slobbering fishing buddies, so you must always roll down your window when you need to spit.  7. Never compare her figure to that of a Coors can, even if you're trying to tell her that she's real sleek.  8. Deep Woods Off! is not a substitute for deodorant.  9. Never tell a aubie woman straight out that you can't have her name tatooed on you because your Mom, who is so proud of your bicep bearing her name, would be psychotically jealous.  10. Do not invite a woman to go cow-tipping if she's wearing high heels.    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Outside of a rural/redneck town does anyone dance to the Electric Slide anymore?  I cant tell you how many times I hear this played here in Sailor Town USA.  You should see how the place lights up, and huge fat Bremelos almost run each other over racing to the dance floor to show they are Queen of the Electric Slide dance.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Electric Slide it’s a cheezy, poppy dance song where you do a certain dance called the Electric Slide (its kinda like a country line dance or the Hustle).  Im embarrassed to admit I can do the Electric Slide, and yes I have done it of recent.  LOL   End of a Dry Spell  My friend  Kathleen had a good weekend, after what she called one of her “longest dry spells”.   We went out drinkin and dancin at the Sailor Bar and she ended up boinkin a friend from high school… JediHavok.  They were so obvious about it, I had to tease them.  The next morning we were out to breakfast, in night clothes how cheezy is that, and I asked DarthHavok if he had a hickey on his neck.  He looked right at Kathleen and said “No” in a “do I?” way.  Busted!  I laughed so hard.  Im happy for Kathleen though.  She had needed some action, the only she had been getting was from a desperate GI in Iraq who kept flashing her his “willy” on his webcam.     Hickey Neck  Yes I actually have a few hickeys on my neck from my young, sweet boy-toy.  I know its so “junior high” but I guess it’s the Ann Rice fan in me that loves to be bitten.  Kathleen tells me I am “tagged”, but the funny thing is I “tagged” him too.  Since he is in the Navy, I hope this isnt consider defacing of Government property.  LOL  Oh well sometimes its fun to be trashy and wild.     The long walk home  Eunice is the wildest of all my chick friends.  She has been married twice to sailors, loves sex, and considers sailors to be her own personal “disposable sex toys”.  She’s a crazy one, but I love her dearly.  She has warned me that she can never meet my current boy-toy since the submarine he is on, she has gone through and slept with most of the ship.  Eunice is the queen of one night stands, and is full of advice on “using men”.  Her last experience has left her kind of bitter, she picked up some buff sailor from the Sailor Bar and took him to bed with her.  I guess they slept most of the night without doing much as kiss.  In the morning when he was sporting wood, somehow he talked her into doing the wild thing with him.  She obliged and when she left the room to go to the bathroom, that sneaky sailor walked out the door and took off.  No thank you, or goodbye, or the fake “give me your number and I will call you”.  He just walked out the door.  Eunice said he had a small penis anyway, but was still shocked by his behavior.      urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      My friend Eunice was supposed to write for me the rules of dating, so I could post it here on the website.  What are “The Rules” it sounds like games to me, but I hear one must adhere to them.  Is it like don’t call someone for 2 days after you get their phone number?   How many times is it okay to call a guy before he calls you back?  How many dates should you have with someone before you have sex?  According to Tom Lykus there are definitely rules of dating, (Lykus 101 teaches the young male demographics how to get more pussy for less pay).   For kicks I listen to Tom on my commute home, kinda to get into the mind of the male species.  One of Tom’s rules, never answer the phone on the weekend (so that girls see you are busy).  He also says when taking a woman out to dinner, eat a big meal at home before you go out. This way when you get to the restaurant you can only order a salad (because what woman would order more than you?).  Tom says that if a woman doesn’t put out after 2 dates, dump her and move on.  Tom says men should not date single mothers or career women, this is so you don’t have to deal with baggage, and the person you are with will put you totally first.   Don’t know if I agree with everything Tom says, but he does present some interesting food for thought, especially with regard to rules.   Here are some more rules I got off a player website.   Rules for relationships and dating...   When asked "What are you doing?" never reply with "Nothing", always appear to be busy even if you are not. This will make you seem to be much more interesting.  ****Don’t know if I think saying nothing means you are a boring person.  Do you always have to lie and act busy to seem interesting.  Don’t interesting people sit down relax and DO NOTHING sometime????  Never stay on the phone for a long period of time (unless a serious relationship has already been established) or you will appear to be a boring person because you have nothing better to do.  *******Okay I guess this explains why the phone calls I have received lately have been so short.   Never act submissive because you want to be the "Nice Guy". In the real world (outside of Hollywood) nice guys don't get the girls, so stand up for yourself and don't get used. However, don't become the "Jerk" either, the goal is to be likable while also showing strength by always expressing yourself and your opinions.  *****I agree with this  Never, and I mean never, say "I love you" first. If you say these 3 words too early you can easily change a great relationship into an uncomfortable one (for the both of you), and possibly destroy it.  ******It definitely sucks when someone says I love you too soon.  Talk about making you want to run the other way screaming.   Always keep things happening in your existing relationship. Try new things (not only sexually) and never become lazy by just sitting around watching TV every night. If your girl becomes bored with the relationship she will leave or cheat on you. Remember "It's easier to steal someone else's girl than it is to keep your own!"  Never act serious at the beginning of a new relationship. You may begin to develop strong feelings early on, but you don't want to scare your dream girl away by coming on too strong. Just try to relax and have fun while allowing your relationship to blossom at a steady (but slow) pace.  When going on a first date, never go to a club or movie because you want to spend this time talking to her and using the player skills you've learned, which can be limited once you go to these places. Take her somewhere fun (during the daytime, such as miniature golf, the beach, etc.). This will lighten the tension and make both of you more comfortable.  Never attempt to have sex with her unless you know (for sure) that it's yours for the taking. If you try and fail, chances are she will be extremely uncomfortable around you the next time you get together, and probably never return your calls or avoid you completely.  Always change the amounts of attention you give her. For instance: Give her your undivided attention for an extended period of time one day, and appear to be too busy to even talk to her the next. This will drive her crazy, and you will be on her mind the entire day. She will be wondering if she said or did something wrong, and she will become much more interested in you because she won't be able to think about anything else.  ******Oh yeah I love it when they play this game with me.  RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  Once you are in an established relationship for a relatively long period of time say this to your girl: "You know, your probably my best friend". She will most likely burst into tears and will love you twice as much for saying it. *note* Make sure you say this at the right time. For example, saying this while shopping at the mall would be a bad idea, but saying it late at night while your laying in bed would be on point like a fax machine.  Never bring a woman to a really expensive restaurant for any of the first few dates. You may think that you are impressing her, but all you are really doing is adding to the tension.  Never... ever... borrow money from a woman. Even if she is a long term girlfriend and you need it badly. Women want a man that can support them in any situation. In a woman's mind "For rich or for poor" actually means "You better get rich, and if your poor I'm gone". If you borrow money she will be thinking "Hows he going to support me when he can't even take care of himself". Never let her know if your in financial trouble.  Never become obsessed with a particular woman you've just met, no matter how hot she is or how much she seems to like you. If you think about her too much, you will begin building up tension in your mind which can effect how you act the next time you see her, and that is when you want to be on top of your game, not looking like an idiot with nothing to say.  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       Warning: name dropping, nudity, and adult content. Adult discretion advised.     The Truth Be Told  I’m not gonna lie to you all, I used to be a marijuana activist.  I am a pot smoker and I’m not ashamed of it.  I believe what we do in the freedom of our home should be protected.  I believe patents who are sick and dying with cancer, aids and other medical problems should have safe access to this healing herb.  I believe cannabis to be like grapes or hops, a plant with many strains with different effects and potencies.  I believe marijuana to be an herb that has medicinal properties that can treat conditions, and is most effective with nausea and wasting away syndrome.     urlLink Spearhead Tour  I’m gonna tell you all about a story, a time when I toured with the band Spearhead.  At this time, I was working heavily with Cannabis Action Network, an activist group based out of Berkeley, Calif.  Michael Franti and his band spearhead where to be performing a 420 tour in the Bay Area, and wanted representation about the cause.  I was asked if I would represent CAN for the tour.  Happily and honored I accepted.    Activist Table Fun  If you have never tabled for an activist group it is an experience in itself.  It involves loading and unloading this big ass plastic box around that is filled to the brim with political information; and of course you also lug around card table. Political information includes petitions, voter registration forms, flyers, handouts, and business cards.  You also sell hemp products (wallets, hackey stacks, etc) to make a little cash. You set up your little display with loving pride, and then hang out and educate people about the cause.    Stonters in Santa Cruz  Our first show was Santa Cruz. I was working a paid gig at the Berkeley Patients Group at the time and  my cowerker, Santa Cruz boy, decided he would table with me for the event.  We set up our table in this small venue that was near the stage.  We were next to the usual tabelers; some tree huggers and PETA.  We had gotten hits of pure ecstasy, that we dediced we were going to take before the show.  Music can best be experienced high.     Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  The show was amazing, we had a great view from our table and Michael Franti never ceases to amaze.  Peaking on X, I danced to the music like a flower child, and felt one with the spirit and grove of the show.  Micheal Franti says “We have a surprise musician” and out comes Woody Harrelson playing some bongo type drum.  It was fucking amazing, tripping on X, watching an incredible band, feeling the groove, and seeing Woody Harrelson up close.    Do you want to come Backstage?  After the performance, the band manager came up to our table as we were packing up to leave.  She asks“would you like to come back stage”?  Well, being as I have had rock star friends in my past, the whole back stage scene to me isn’t all that glamorous.  The whole groopie kiss ass thing gets really old an annoying.  Although I did want to talk to Woody and Michael  Franti.  Of course, I knew they were really asking us backstage  for our connections…pot connections.  We were, of course, the pot table!  Luckily Santa Cruz boy came prepared; having 3 glass pipes in his backpack, and some amazing bubbleberry medicine.  I had a bag of blonde hash, given to me by a grower, hanging out in my purse.    Lets Get Nekkid!  We get backstage to this small, old theater type room.  When we get there it is Woody, Michael, other band members (I think) and some girls in between the mix like opposing colored checkers.  Everyone was in that “after the show” high.  Santa Cruz boy whips out the pipes and the really good medicine and starts passing them around in opposite directions.  The performers are doing their after show comedown routiene, and happily smoking our treasures.  Stoned someone says ”lets get naked.”  I’m thinking to myself, " HELL...NO....I’m no groupie here, I’m not getting naked".  The groopie girls take off their pants and panties and sit naked next to Woody and Michael.  Micheal also gets naked.  Woody strips to these Marky Mark like tighty whities.    Now whos the Rock Star?  I’m thinking, "Okay time to get out of here..NOW".  I have more self-respect than to act like an ass, especially if I am tryinig to leave an impression.  Quick thinking, I pull out my bag of hash and hand it to Woody.  He takes it with a big sexy grin, and says “Is this for me”.  Having a sexual energy impossible to resist, I look deeply into his eyes and reply “Yeah baby…. That is for you”.     Book like a Librarian  Knowing its best to make an impression and leave, I lightly tap Santa Cruz boy on his leg.  He collects his pipes and we get up and leave.      We said to ourselves, "That is how you do it.  Make an impression and go.  Now who is the rockstar?"    To be continued.  Next venue, Pentaluma, CA.

       Who needs love when you’ve got a gun?  –  Black Flag    If love be rough with you, be rough with love.  Prick love for pricking you and beat love down. - William Shakespeare    Black Love   Ive seen love in the eyes of others Beautiful and captivating Giving hope    My heart has experienced sharp Painful Throbbing that always goes away Like an outcast Christmas tree All  pomp and circumstance Thown out  Im left alone again Safe -  vadergrrrl 7/04    Last night I dreamt somebody loved me: no hope ---no harm just another false alarm  - The Smiths “Strange ways, Here We Come”    If two people love each other,, there can be no happy ending to it  –  Ernest Hemingway    Is This for Real?  Sometimes Im not sure whether I believe in love.  Maybe Im a cynic, maybe Ive been burned…. I really don’t know.  I’m not looking for love, in fact, not at all.  I also question whether I have ever really been in love.  Yes, I’ve been married and divorced, lived with a guy, had two marriage proposals and two promise rings… but….. it all seems so cheap, and wishy washy, so plastic.  Most of the time, I have done the ending.  Maybe its easier this way, or maybe I’m just a cold hearted bitch.  When things get tense, and filled with drama…. I leave.     Walking Wounded  Except for one time.  The one I lived with for a while, who I felt a love for like no other.  When things got to intense, I left him, then I came back and….he left me.  The pain cut through me like a cutlery knife.  I re-joined the wanderings of the walking wounded. The sad thing is, he almost killed me… the reason I first left him.    To the Moon Alice….He Snapped  One day he snapped, threw me to the ground punching me and chocking me.  Telling me with fiery demon eyes that he was going to kill me.  I cried and begged for my life…..“Please don’t kill me, I love you”.  After a bit, like the end of a storm, he stopped, gained composure… then let out a cry like a wounded animal.  I ran upstairs to the bathroom and locked the door.  Blood oozed out, all over my body.  I took a long hot bath, and silently sobbed.  He waited outside the door, telling me how sorry he was, how much he loved me, and crying like a broken country record.  When I got out of the bath, he was there, waiting with a tear stained face, and asking to hold me.  I felt so broken; my heart was dead, and in little pieces.  I was limp like a rag doll, and void as a zombie.  I fell into his arms and let him “make love” to me.     Escape  I left him soon after that by moving across two states.  We kept in touch, but moved on, I found another boy who wanted to marry me.  Still, I craved him, dreamed of him, and had a hunger for him like no other.  As sick as it sounds, I wanted him back, and loved him deeply, in some black and twisted way.  We kept in touch, I sent him a few nude photos, he visited me a few times and we had amazing sex.     Cycle of Pain  A year later I moved back to Calif and into his house.  We spent a few blissful months together, then, he left me.  I remember a hot summer night, and him taking me out to dinner at some beachfront restaurant.  He told me there was another.  Tears ran down my face like rain.  I recall the waiter, this cute blond boy, looking at me with compassion and empathy.  I wanted to thank him, but I had to look away…..     Fizzel and Pop  That was six years ago, and I still have not known love like that.  With my last boyfriend, yes there was that tingling magic kinda sparkle, but that faded fast with drama and jealousy.  Once my heart turns cold, there is no recovering.     JellyBean Boom  If love is about pain and abuse, I don’t want any part of it again. I also question myself, and how I could love someone who tried to kill me.  What the fuck is wrong with me? Until I figure this shit out, I’m happy being a lone, with my cats, and my son, and my vibrator and my fuck buddies/boy toys.  My kind of love hurts, kills, and opens the floodgate for all sorts of psychosis.  I don’t know if I ever want to feel that vulnerable again.     I met a young man who was wounded in love, I met another man who was wounded in hatred  –  Boy Dylan    People who are sensible about love are incapable of it   -  Douglas Yates    Love is 2 minutes and 52 seconds of squelching noises  –  Johnny Rotten    I believe love to be hurtful to society, and to the individual happiness of men.  I believe, in short, that love does more harm than good  –  Napoleon Bonaparte    Sappy Sing Along Time  Okay and on a lighter note…. Here is a song that always helps me feel better.

       That old black magic has me in it’s spell, That old black magic that you weave so well Those icy fingers up and down my spine, The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine, The same old tingle that I feel inside And then that elevator starts it’s slide, Down and down I go, Round and round I go, Like a leaf that’s caught in the tide. I should stay away but what can I do, I hear your name, and I’m aflame, A flame with such a burning desire, That only your kiss can put out the fire. ’cause you’re the lover I have waited for, The mate that fate had me created for, And every time you lips meet mine, Darling, down and down I go, Round and round I go, In that spin of love that I am in, Under that old black of love .  - Frank Sinatra “Black Magic”       The Magick of Good Sex  Sexual energy is very powerful, and when combined with a like mind it can be magick!  Have you ever lit candles, put on music such as Nine Inch Nails, Skinny Puppy or Marilyn Manson and unleashed yourself with your partner to the mysterious and magickal world of uninhibited, passionate and sacred sex?  Its like that feeling you get during and after sex, like there truly is magick, or a sacred bond that culminates in a magical and oh so sacred orgasm.      Sex Magick...ooooooh Tantric Sex  Sex magick, also called tantric sex, is basically having sex in a powerful, and animal like way, so that you and your partner connect in spirit, mind and body, and create not only fucking sex, but some sort of powerful, out of body magick.  Pagans believed sex to be sacred and powerful, and there are traditions of sexual sabbats and wild orgies where they would experience the power of sex magick.  In modern times, these traditions continue, whether it be alone, in a group or with a partner.  You don’t have to be pagan or witchy to experience sex magick.  You can be Christian, Jewish, Buddhist or whatever.  Basically you need to drop all inhibition, shame, hang ups, and fears, and unleash your inner animal, and allow yourself to go wild, and experience the fiery passion of spiritual sex.   Once you let go, and totally connect your spirit, you can achieve the most out of body orgasm and connection you have ever known… voila…. Sex magick.       urlLink Crowley, Aleister Edward  (1875-1947) 	 British occultist and magician, who described himself as the 'Beast of the Apocalypse' and was called by the media 'The Wickedest Man in the World'. Crowley both infuriated and fascinated people with his rites of sex magic and blood sacrifice. Despite his excesses some regard him as one of the most brilliant magicians of modern times.     Here is some information I found on  urlLink Sex Magic  from the internet.    Sex Magick is a powerful tool to get what you want, but it can also be misunderstood and misused because it may be seen as nothing more than porno when in fact it is a beautiful act two people can share together or it can be performed alone, in a group or even symbolically. Sex magick is performed not as a form of 'sleazy' sex , but as a tool to raise the energies of a person or two people to perform a ritual. Sex amongst pagans is believed to be a celebration of the bodies of both man and woman, god and goddess, natural and open, something beautiful. It can be performed to symbolize the god and goddess or to bring two people together. I must confess, I have not been blessed with a willing partner and therefore I can only relate what I have learned. I believe that sex magick can be an erotic form of sex and a powerful tool to get what you want and it is the least manipulative of spell craft since both partners are fully aware and synchronized to agree and know what is going on. And, I believe it can have a powerful hold on the two people involved. How many of you can perform while maintaining eye contact and focus throughout the act? It leaves one open and vulnerable and this is why it is the most difficult to maintain throughout the act.  Beltane is the most obvious sexual time of celebration, the traditional Maypole is itself an obvious phallic symbol. Sex is seen as a gift, a pleasure given to us from the god and goddess. To fully understand and appreciate sex magick one must shed all Christian fundamentalist principles that tend to leave one with repressive guilt and shame. Sex magick rituals are most suitable for the Beltane sabbot.     Aleister Crowley suggests that when performing sex magick the woman must be submissive and the vessel for the man. I don`t know how you feel about this in this day and age, but this may work well for some spells. It may be useful for the woman to try to retain the energy for as long as possible before submitting. It may be useful for some rituals for the man to shape shift into an animal. I the dog, she the bitch, I the helve, she the axe I the cock, she the hen, That, that I desire  (gypsy sex magick chant) There are three kinds of sex magick: Monofocal - Focus is on one. This can be done through symbolism or self masturbation or assistance by another or even a group. This solitary method is good for divination purposes. You can alter your state of consciousness or work with a sigil in mind. If you are assisted by another for divination purposes this is called eroto-comatose lucidity (ECL).  Duofocal - Focus on two. This is performed with two partners. Love is important for this focus, but don`t get this confused with the romantic kind of love. As Aleister Crowley states, "love is the law, love under will" . The purpose of this is to unite two opposites, for example : the man and woman, magnetic and electric, yin and yang. "love is most nearly itself when here and now cease to matter" T.S.Elliot Polyfocul - Focus on many, a group with one, a leader to guide the energy to serve a purpose. This form of sex magick is not meant to be an orgy, but it is sex with multiple partners at one time for the purpose of raising energies and being guided by a leader. The guide`s purpose is to organize and direct the energies. What to do before performing sex magick:  for one person 1. decide what your energy raised will be for. What spell to perform, what sigil you will concentrate on, what chant, etc. 2. bathe in salt water. 3. gather your appropriate color candles, herbs, incense, etc. 4. make sure you will not be disturbed 5. center yourself 6. cast your circle  for two people: 1.find a loving space  2.cast a circle 3.ground, center 4 begin with anointing each other with appropriate oils 5.incense appropriate to the spell, candle colors, herbs, etc 6.eye contact is started and maintained 7. rhythmic breathing 8. rhythmic movement There are several ways two people can raise energies together for spell work   1.eye contact -focus, releasing egos,vulnerability is strength, openness is power,losing control is the freedom to feel and be 2.synchronized breathing - hypnotic state 3.synchronized movement - hypnotic state 4.rhythmic stroking - again inducing hypnotic state 5.anointing each other with specific oils for the spell 6.visualization  7.synchronized chanting 8.flagellation- if both agree To raise energies alone with symbols   1.candles 2.swords 3.knives 4.athames  5.chalice  6.bowls 7.needles 8.crystal ball 9.menstrual blood 10.the moon 11.silver and gold 12.snakes    Here is some information on  urlLink Tantric Sex    What is "Primal Power" Tantric Sex? "Primal power" is basically a modern "buzzword" for traditional forms. Obviously, we feel ours is "the best", although we admire most others, and offer supplies for, all other methods.  Amongst ourselves, we personally just refer to it as tantra, or tantric sex-yoga (see tantric yoga-tantra yoga ) (although those terms cover many other types). Among many other things, it teaches sexual interaction that has MAJOR benefits for both partners - including greatly enhanced sexual pleasure and "energy rush".  The Major Benefits: 1. Males can delay orgasm indefinitely & make love as long as both partners desire;  2. Females can have virtually unending orgasms;  3. Males can share and "virtually experience" their partner's orgasms, as their own.  4. Males experience a post-orgasm energy boost, rather than the typical energy drain;  5. Greatly enhanced intimacy;  6. Ecstatic "high" from the continued buildup of orgasmic energy and meditation-like aspects  What is Tantric Sex? On transforming the act of sex into a sacrament of love and spiritual union.  Tantric sex is meditative, spontaneous and very intimate lovemaking. You learn to prolong the act of making love and to focus on, rather than dispel, potent orgasmic energies moving through you, thereby raising the level of your consciousness. Tantra transports sexuality from simply doing to actually being. There is no end goal in Tantric sex, only the present moment of an ideal, harmonious union. Tantra teaches you to worship your sexual partner and to transform the act of sex into a sacrament of love. Lovemaking between two partners, when entered with awareness, can be a gateway to sexual and spiritual ecstasy alike. Tantric sex attempts to awaken powerful psychic energies within through which we can enter into higher states of consciousness.

      I&nbsp;want to take this time to send some positive energy and healing to all my friends in bloggerland. Life is a strange journey, and we all have crossed paths for a reason. Whatever spiritual belief system you hold, its important to have faith and have a sense for healing.    Meditative Healing  I’m going to share with you all one of my favorite meditations. 1. ground you body. Do this by planting your feet flat on the ground, and feeling your connection to the earth. 2. Take deep healing breaths 3. Visualize a white light surrounding your body clockwise, protecting you from harm, and surrounding you with love.  4. Let this white light penetrate your body, and go up through all your chakras and out through the top of your head. Releasing any negative energy and filling your body, heart and soul with positive white light.   Here are some inspirational quotes, from some great minds.    You gain strength, courage, and confidence by each experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, "I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along."  -  Eleanor Roosevelt   &nbsp;  The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.    Mahatma Gandhi      Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.    Albert Einstein  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, not absence of fear.    Mark Twain      Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power.    Lao Tzu      Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.   Mahatma Gandhi    In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.    Martin Luther King  &nbsp;  &nbsp;My dad always used to say, "If you're falling off a cliff, you may as well try to fly. You have nothing to lose."   Captain John Sheridan, Babylon 5  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I never came upon any of my discoveries through the process of rational thinking.    Albert Einstein      The Force both obeys and commands.   Yoda, Star Wars  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Please accept my resignation. I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.   Groucho Marx    Tarot Healing  I myself believe in the power of tarot. I have a few tarot decks, from the traditional Rider series, to my favorite, "the Faires and Oracles" deck illustrated by Brian Froud.  Here is a description:   The Faeries' Oracle is a lovely, well put together book; whether it is a good tool for predicting the future, giving one insight into oneself, or aiding in decision-making must be determined by each individual. The deck consists of sixty-five cards plus a blank card to draw in one's own faery mentor. This is intended to "personalize and attune" the cards to one's particular "energy".    Im going to take out my tarot deck, meditate on the blogger family, and see what card comes up.    The Glanconer    Illusion. Delusion. Lust. Projection. Clear Sight    Have you ever noticed that when we really, really want someone or something, we tend to see it without clarity? The object of our lust looks flawless and glamorous, which should tell us something right away. But, usually, it doesn’t. He says his name is Smooth Harry, but that may be a little illusion of his own. The Glanconer doesn’t change his shape to temp us with our own mental confusions and paradoxes. He simply wear a mirror in which we see our desires temptingly displayed. He does not try to fool us, he simply allows us to fool ourselves. Well, he may try a little, just to make the test look difficult. After all, we can be more proud of passing a difficult test than an easy one, cant we? Smooth Harry also appeals to our vanity – and the more we have of it, the easier his work is. A little flattery and we’ll believe whatever he wants us to swallow – especially since it is just what we want to swallow anyway. Of all the faery challengers, Smooth Harry is the most likely to be sly. He practices a sort of emotional judo where he lets our own desires lead us into a fall. As we rush headlong toward our vision of perfection, he need only step to one side as we cast ourselves at him – and we go down. Not fun, but perhaps we might just learn something from it.    It is not good to make decisions when blinded by lust. Whether it is lust for a person, a thing, or an idea, we need to pause and take our time before making actual commitments. We need to read the fine point, check the foundations, get a mechanic to test the so-beautiful second hand car. If we are considering buying something, we can refuse to let ourselves be rushed into it and take time to make sure it is really what we think it is. If we are considering making a commitment to other people, we need to take our time and really get to know them better. The other lesson in seeing the truth behind a beglamoured surface, though in this case it is we who have cast the glamour.      Take that what you want to. I think I know what it means for me.  Now I’m going to meditate on my Rider deck and pull a card.   Queen of Cups (Reversed)    Beautiful, fair, dreamy – as one who sees vision in a cup.    Reversed  The accounts vary, good woman, otherwise distinguished woman but not one to be trusted, perverse woman, vice dishonor, depravity.     Eeks don’t like the sound of that one, but the cards don’t lie… this is what I got.    Interesting tarot facts   The Tarot (or Tarot Card Deck) consists of 78 cards, which have been used for fortune telling for centuries. There is much controversy as to the official history of the tarot. Some say a medieval version of the cards dates back to the early 1400s. Because of the Italian-looking imagery found in the cards, some say they have an Italian origin. Others say the cards came from China or Egypt. And of course the Gypsies, long associated with the art of fortune telling, are said to have had a hand in the creation, if not the popularity of the cards. The mystery is further stirred when the correspondence of the cards with Cabbalistic or Kabalistic philosophy is considered. Although agreement of the history and origin of the cards is not to be found, it can be agreed that the tarot is a very popular mysterious oracle.     Aleister Crowley, too, founded his own occult school, the Ordo Templi Orientis, which had to do, among other things, sex magic. Working with Freida Harris, he created the colorful Book of Thoth Tarot. He considered identifying with each card more important than trying to guess about origins.     The tarot deck is comprised of 78 cards: 22 major arcana and 56 minor arcana. The 22 major arcana cards are supposed to depict a journey through one's life, which originates with the Fool card and ends with a card called The World. Although mystics have called this the road through life, some clergy have said the cards were the road to hell and the devil. The Devil is a card in the major arcane, but it depicts enslavement, addiction and misdirection rather than Satan. Another widely misunderstood card is the famous Death card, which does not mean death of the physical body, but merely change and transformation of some kind. The fool card is the predecessor of the Joker cards we discard before shuffling most decks for a game.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  You are the Magician card. Magick is the use of the will to effect change in reality. The will is the ability to direct knowledge and experience towards an end goal. The Magician is capable of manipulating his environment because he knows it so well. He effects the thoughts and emotions of those around him. Therefore, the Magician is often thought of as an artist, writing or speaking in a way that strongly influences others. The Magician understands how to bring concepts into form and how to express metaphysical concepts in a physical way. He is seen with the symbols of each suit: a disk, a cup, a sword and a wand. These symbols are each a physical expression of a concept. They are The Magician's tools. Following after The Fool, The Magician acts as a messenger. His planet is Mercury, who is Messenger of the Gods. He brings The Fool into the new world that The Fool seeks. The Magician represents the act of creation. Because he can use his knowledge to form something new, he seems to be able to make a thing appear out of a void. Image from: L. S.

      We have all seen or heard about the now infamous  urlLink Pamela and Tommy Lee Porn  and the recent  urlLink A Night in Paris  home movie (featuring Paris Hilton). These very publicized videos provide an inside look into the art of home porn. Definitely, there are rules one must follow when making home movies, and or taking explicit photographs. Following certain guidelines and rules can make this experience worthwhile, as it can provide hours of orgasmic fun in the making and in the viewing.  I tried to find articles about this on the web, but was unable to find anything. So, I will have to resort to using my own past experience and creative imagination. Enjoy.   1.  Trust.  When making or thinking about making a home porno or X-rated pictures make sure you are engaging in this with someone you trust. It should be someone you have a committed relationship with, and it should be something you have discussed and agreed upon. Don’t ever do this with a casual sex partner, or one nightstand!   2.&nbsp;  Use sound judgement.  Just like entering a contract, making porn, or taking porn pics is a permanent record of your sexuality. Make sure you are of sound mind when you agree to it. You can get drunk while in preparation for it, but make sure you are lucid and certain upon deciding to do it. Guys, don’t ever break out the video camera on some drunk girl. This is a definite violation, and is totally wrong. Both parties should consent that this is something okay, and that they are comfortable about engaging in.   3.  Learn from the pros.  Watch a porno that you like, for tips, suggestions, styles and sex techniques. I always recommend something by Nina Hartley or jenna jameson. Find a porn star who is in sexual control, loves her body, loves herself, and emulate her.   4.  Get into character mode . Give yourself a porn name (name of first pet + mother’s maiden name or first street) or make something up. In your home movie you will not be you, but instead you are this sassy and sexual porn entity. My porn name is Muffin Skold, and when Muffin comes out….let the show begin! Always stay in character. Pretend you are this slutty, dirty porn star, and act like one.   5.  Use fantasy and imagination . Dress up in bondage gear, sexy lingerie, fishnet stalkings, high heels, make up, bright red lipstick, and tacky bright red fingernail polish. You are creating a fantasy here, in the erotic world of porn land. Doll yourself up to the nines. Guys really only have to be nekkid, but a nice cowboy hat or fancy cock ring, can also do wonders…. lol   6.  The camera man.  Use the combo of tripod and hand held shots. I have done porn with just the tripod, and that gets boring after a while. Hand held shots work best, because then you can really get the close ups and the money shots…. Ie the cum shot. If you have a friend you want to invite into your nasty sex world, perhaps they would be the cameramen. Most men would object to a male friend seeing you in slut mode, but wouldn’t care if your sleazy bi-sexual friend did the work. This however, is tricky, because it opens the door to jealousy and other issues. So its probably best to keep the film shot by tripod and hand held shots.   7.  No harry ass shots . Most men do not like to see their hairy bum in action. When using the tripod angle the camera to the side of the bed, floor, kitchen table or wherever. So what you are seeing on film is the side view, and not a full on ass shot. The opposite of course is true for women. Men want to see the ass shot, full on hard-core style. The man holding the camera, and the woman getting on top with her head facing his feet can best achieve this. You can get some great ass and penetration shots this way.   8.  Love your body . If you have body issues, where lingerie that hides what you want hidden, but also reveals the essential of porn (t&a). Also, if your really shy, and don’t want your face in there, purchase an elegant ball room mask, or something like they wore in the Kubric film "Eyes Wide Shut".   9.  Keep the lights on bright.  Your home movie will not come out well in candlelight, soft lighting, or in the dark. You need to have full lighting to really see the hardcore action.   10.  Talk in character.  While you are in slutty character mode, it is essential that you talk like that. Say things like, "put it in my ass big boy!" or "oh…. Your cock is so big"…"My pussy is so wet" etc, etc.   11.  The cum shot is money . Never cum inside your woman, this act is the money shot, and must be caught on film. One of the best parts of Tommy Lee’s home porn was his money shot. Remember in "Boogie Nights" when Dirk Diggler cums inside Amber Waves, and they have to shoot it again? The cum shot is the grand finale of any porn and hence needs to be filmed in all its orgasmic, and volcanic glory.   12.  Go hog wild.  Do things in your film you would normally never do. While filming a shot of you riding on top and him holding the camera, you must play with yourself while screaming in ecstasy and making dirty whore comments. "yeah you like that big boy….mmmmmmmmm". Masturbating during sex is a must. So is anal sex. Even if your not into anal sex, you should always include one close up penetration shot for the sake of the film. Anal sex is also money when it comes to porn.   13.  Oral sex scenes.  Most guys don’t want their face in there besides when they are performing cunnilingus. And even then it should be buried, and not exposed much, except for some glistening, wet mouth shots. Women on the other hand, need to dedicate a lot of porn time to the cock. Guys may have issue with size, so make sure you hold it in an angle that makes it look really big. Also gaze into the camera and take his cock into your mouth nice and slow. You must also say things like "mmmm your so big" and then deep throat him. Try to visualize your porn mentor and her technique as you are doing this. These kind of shots are very important to the man. This is also one of the favorite positions for Polaroid shots. A pretty girl with a big cock in her mouth. Very, popular indeed.   14.  Keep your porn in a safe place.  I think the girl should keep the porn, because she is less likely to show her friends. I would not trust a guy with roommates, because inevitable they will get drunk and want to be studs and show off. A shared safety deposit box is another good idea. Or you could agree to destroy it in a determined time frame. You never want to leave porn with an ex after a break up.   Well, that is all the home porn tips vadergrrrl can think of at the moment. This post of course is dedicated to  urlLink Johnny Walker the Nightwalker , whose sexual stories continue to arouse and inspire.   This post is also dedicated to my new military friends serving overseas. Maybe once I retrieve my home porn from my ex boyfriend, I will send it to the troops in Iraq for their own moral boost. Lol  I do encourage you all to check out their blogs. They are quite amazing. Please don’t leave any sexual type comments though. Though I support cybersexin the troops, I also think this kind of talk should be reserved for IM.  Xxxxxxxxooooooooooo   To end things on a comical note……..  PS. I found this site that I thought was hysterical that you have to check out.  Its called  urlLink Masturbate For Peace   Using Self Love to End Conflict  This site is so friggin cheasy it is hysterical.  Here is some of the humorous content:   The Power of Masturbation  There's no greater antidote for war than love. Feelings of hatred and distrust form the necessary basis of armed confrontation. Replace those negative feelings with love and you're halfway towards resolution of any conflict.  However, any real love must start from within. You can't love others without loving yourself first. And, of course, masturbation is the greatest expression of self-love. So it's natural that we, the citizens of the world, are joining together to masturbate for peace.  As we begin with this act of self-love, we encourage others to do the same, to take pleasure in life and to share masturbation's positive energy with a world in need.   pull down your zip and throw out your trout, using thine mit thrash it about, love your root with vicious precision, to empty your sack must be your mission.i f you cant love yourself you cant love another, so grasp your womb weasel and think of your lover, pound it with force and pound it with speed, pound it for peace that's what the world needs. - Knuckle Shuffler   Top 10 Reasons to Masturbate for Peace  10.

       Gimme my shit… BIATCH!   After a breakup when does it become okay to get your shit back? Do you do it right away like an emotional psycho chick, or do you wait a while for things to cool down? Getting back personal items from an ex is always a problem after a breakup. Should you just say "fuck it" and forget about it? Or should you take some friend, or new boyfriend, over to help you reclaim what is yours?    The X   This is the dilemma I find myself in after my break up last march with X. Granted, I have things of his like his house key, car key, old high school id cards, and a couple of T-shirts. Minor possessions really, things that can be replaced, and/or locks that can be changed. He has never really asked for his things back, though I don’t want them, and I could really care less about having them.    Hardcore possessions   Now, it’s the shit of MINE that he has that really upsets me. If it was a T-shirt or some shoes, yeah, no big deal. But this X has some very, very personal items….. my porn collection, lingerie, panties, my bondage toys, my sex books and oh yeah some home videos we made accompanied by X-rated Polaroid’s. Now, what should someone do in this situation? Yes, X has blackmail material that he could post on the internet and show the world, he also has my favorite lingerie and my porn collection….. Damnit I want it all back!    Sex, lies and videotape   How does one approach this delicate situation? I’m at a total loss here. Should I go over and demand my personal items back? Should I hold him at fingernail point and demand that he burn all incriminating photos and videos? This is one of the reasons NOT to do home movies with someone, you think its all fun and sex at the time, and then when you break up, they have instant blackmail over you.    Amateur porn stars   These home movies are really bad too. We totally did the "lets make a home porn thang" I mean full on wild nasty sex, no holds bar sex…. Everything. Yep, Vader is on tape being the ultimate slut. I mean shit, it was fun at the time, there is nothing like being filmed as you are being a dirty whore, but shit, when you brake up with that person, what happens to the evidence? What is the appropriate etiquette for this?    What is the appropriate?   How do you politely and discreetly ask for those personal items? Part of me wants him to think I don’t give a damn, and I don’t really. But I would like my lingerie and panties back, and my sex toys, porn collection and most important the home movies. If anyone has ever experienced a situation like this before please let me know. I broke it off with X, and he is still pretty angry at me. I wanted to be friends, but he couldn’t handle that. He wanted, sex, sex and sex. I love sex, but I just didn’t want to do it with him anymore.  Any advice?   urlLink Blogarama    urlLink Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       Blog Drama   I first want to dedicate this post to my friend  urlLink Jay .&nbsp; I have learned a lot from him and I grow to love/hate him more and more everyday.&nbsp;  xxxxxxooooooooooo  &nbsp;   Out of it today   I woke up today with swollen tonsils, and I feel rather blah.&nbsp; Im overwhelmed here at work, so much to do, not sure which project to complete first.&nbsp; I wont have time to blog today, but I will do a short post.  &nbsp;   Bright Lights Big City   Needing a respite from my hometown, and my own drama, I decided to spend the night in Seattle on Saturday.&nbsp; Seattle is a 60-minute ferry ride from my hometown.&nbsp; I don’t go out to Seattle much, though I probably should.&nbsp; My sister/best grrrl friend, It Grrrl, lives in Seattle, right downtown, about a few blocks from the Pike Place Market.&nbsp; It Grrrl is single, never married and works as a bar tender for a hot spot bar in Seattle.&nbsp; She also is going to school to be a yoga teacher and she is a painter (artist).&nbsp; She always knows the cool shows and events happenings in Seattle.  &nbsp;   Homelessness   As soon as I get off the ferry and start walking in downtown Seattle I start to notice the homeless, something I don’t see in my hometown.&nbsp; I see two gutter punk kids playing chess with a homeless and hungry sign.&nbsp; I see a woman sleeping next to a shopping cart, I see a shabbily dressed man peeing on the street.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a sensitive Pisces, I’m always bothered by societal issues&nbsp; such as homelessness.&nbsp; It’s hard for me to tune it out.&nbsp; When I was going to Berkeley, I was very burned out by this social issue.&nbsp; Berkeley has one of the worst problems with homeless people I have ever seen.&nbsp; Everyday I would walk down Telegraph Ave in Berkeley to get to class, and I would have to pass the endless lines of homeless.&nbsp; California has aggressive pan handling laws, which mean, its legal for homeless to harass you.&nbsp; On a typical day I would be walking to class, and some really soiled guy with no teeth would come up in my face and say “do you have any money?” and I would say no, and he would say “come on Im hungry, well fuck you then”.&nbsp; You could not go anywhere without being harassed for money, and even sexually harassed.&nbsp; There was also the teenage gutter punks who would harass you walking down the street, act generally like idiots, and then you would see them later that night drunk at the punk rock show.&nbsp; I vividly remember one guy that disturbed me the most, he had fitlhy and fesces soiled pants, half a beard, shaved head spots from ringworm, etc,&nbsp; and he would eat out of the trash cans on the Berkeley campus.&nbsp; This would always gross me out, and I would be sitting down eating and he would walk right up to the trashcan, and eat.&nbsp; I thought this was his plan, because immediately after he did that, I would loose my appetite and put the rest of my food in the trash.&nbsp; I don’t mean to sound heartless, but I really was burned out of this by the time I graduated from Berkeley.&nbsp; Living in Bremerton the last 4 years, I just do see homelessness like I used to.&nbsp; This was the first thing I noticed about being in the City.  &nbsp;   The Band and the $12 drink   It Grrrl and I went to a nightclub to watch some music.&nbsp; It Grrrl says, “its one of my favorite bands you will like it”.&nbsp; First of all, you pay $15 at the door to get in, then my jaw about hit the fucking floor when it cost me $12 for a double tall vodka redbull.&nbsp; $12 for one drink….. I must be a hick from the sticks, but I still cant get over the price of one drink.&nbsp; The bar is full of Seattle types, hipsters, girls with stringy hair and glasses, guys with hip cat struts and upscale clothes and shoes.&nbsp; “The band” turns out to be some guy spinning records.&nbsp; Maybe Im just an old time rock n roll grrrl, but to me a band consists of a drummer, bassist, guitarist and typically a singer.&nbsp; I never realized a band could also be some dj spinning records and making up songs.&nbsp; I guess Im just not hip with the times here.&nbsp; The music was okay, I danced and had fun.  &nbsp;   Party Favors   Another interesting thing about city life is the popularity of nose candy.&nbsp; Everyone does it, and many sell it to support their habit and make some cash on the side.&nbsp; Nose candy and club life seem to go hand in hand.&nbsp; This really isn’t my scene, and I really feel like a small town grrrl because Im just not hip with that.&nbsp; It kinda reminds me of the movie with Michael J. Fox, bright lights big city.  &nbsp;   Happy Homecoming   I come home after a great night in Seattle the next afternoon.&nbsp; After I get home, I decide to hang out with some of my townie friends for one drink.&nbsp; Boy this was a mistake.&nbsp; I get to the bar and they are all drunk and obnoxious.&nbsp; Im sitting there, trying to spend time with my friend Rozie the Rivetor, and her company starts insulting all my friends.&nbsp; In small towns everyone gossips, everyone talks shit, no one has anything nice to say about anyone behind their back.&nbsp; I find this very depressing; I don’t understand why people have to be such backstabbing, jealous and ruthless.&nbsp; This made me sad.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   urlLink Blogarama    urlLink Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

              Vadergrrrl Politics  With all the talk of presidential elections and other political spew, I decided to dedicate a post to my personal politics.  Being somewhat anti-politics at the moment, I have found my own way to support our country…. Supporting our troops!   This is a cause I care deeply about, with my brother just returning from Iraq, and my currently living in a MAJOR naval town.  Since my recent break up, Ive taken a couple for the troups and enjoyed every minute of it.  MMMMMM young sailors and G.I’s….. humana humana   Bremerton Sluts…. Keep on Keepin On!  I was listening to an interview the other morning about the soldiers in Iraq, and the military in general.  These men/women make a commitment for our freedom, put their lives potentially on the line for us!  At the end of the interview, the DJ said “Lets support our troops….. Bremerton sluts, keep on keeping on!” Being as Im from Bremerton, and at times a freaky slut, I though gee, this is a message for me!   Support Our Troops!  We have soldier dying every day in Iraq, and not only that, soldiers whose lives are on hold while they serve our country.   These men/women deserve our support!  What is the best way to support them?  Fuck their brains out, provide blow jobs, or if they are currently serving overseas… cybersex the hell out of them!   Take One For the Country baby!  Here is a website I found for an organization of horney gals willing to take one for the troops.  Its called take one for our country.    urlLink Take for the Country    Mission Statement: To discretely provide US troops shipping out overseas with the most sensually pleasing departure possible.  About US: 'Operation Take One For The Country' (abbreviated OTOFTC) is a movement of like-minded women (women predominantly as of right now) who have covertly organized into groups to frequent eating and drinking establishments near armed service bases where troops are preparing to ship out overseas, and take one for the country, so to speak. We are a virtual organization and have no official headquarters or charter. We believe US service men and women deserve our support and we are willing to make caring choices about making them happy.           MMMMM a Man in Uniform!  There is nothing sexier than a man in uniform, especially ones filled with testosterone and pent up sexual frustration.  On major naval ships, and overseas, soldiers are provided computers with computer access.  We can email them, instant message them, and with webcams do a lot more.  I admit, I cybersexed some lonely GI in Iraq and it was quite fun.  Especially because I can be such a dirty girl, I think he was pleasantly shocked by my vivid imagination.  This particular soldier had a webcam (I do not) and kept flashing his happiness to the camera.  This was particularly amusing since there is like a pod of 20 computers lined up for soldier use, and he was definitely not alone and truly able to expose himself.  LOL     Dip me in honey, strip me nekkid and throw me on the flight deck….. Im ready boys!      Here is a sexy hottie (very far left with the bedroom eyes and nice lips), who I met online and who is leaving in October for Iraq.  Poor sweetie… He definitely deserves LOTS of blow jobs before he leaves… LOL.    Here is my soldier pen pal who is currently in Iraq.  He is a pilot, and this is a photo of him doing laundry.  I haven’t heard from this guy in a while, which worries me…..    -Another sexy cowboy GI.  Whoot whoo….. yes this one deserves a good spankin and then some hot and wild lovin!  YEE HAW! -Here is a Haiku for you (written by Cooter)  You need a spankin'  with a Star Wars figurine,  you Texas cowboy.          Military Friends  A good way to meet military guys is to go to the website MilitaryFriends.com linked here.  urlLink MilitaryFriends.com   You can sign up for free and locate military penpals/cybersexpals all over the world.   Here is another military singles site  urlLink US Military Singles  Here is another link to a site that provides military pen pals  urlLink Support Our Troups          Call to Arms!  Come on all you horney grrrls, you want to get freaky on the internet?  You want to support our Country and Our Freedom?  Find yourself a military hero, and treat that man GOOD! xxxxoooooooo    -Thank you Demon Queen for your help with this post!  Luv ya!       urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Time for Vadergrrrl’s Poetry Slam.  Get out your cigarettes, black beanies, cheap drinks and other pleasures.  Its late, and my brain is fried so I decided to create a poetry slam.  There should be a poem here for everyone, so enjoy…..Im including a few of my own, plus a surprise poet Im dying to see if anyone can guess.     Carpe Diem   O mistress mine, where are you roaming?  O stay and hear! your true-love's coming  That can sing both high and low;  Trip no further, pretty sweeting,  Journey's end in lovers' meeting--  Every wise man's son doth know.  What is love? 'tis not hereafter;  Present mirth hath present laughter;  What's to come is still unsure:  In delay there lies no plenty,--  Then come kiss me, Sweet and twenty,  Youth's a stuff will not endure.   William Shakespeare   Smoke   Light-winged smoke, Icarian bird,  Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,  Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,  Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;  Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form  Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;  By night star-veiling, and by day  Darkening the light blotting out the sun;  Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,  And ask the Gods to pardon this clear flame .  Henry David Thoreau   Alone   FROM childhood's hour I have not been  As others were; I have not seen  As others saw; I could not bring  My passions from a common spring.  From the same source I have not taken  My sorrow; I could not awaken  My heart to joy at the same tone;  And all I loved, I loved alone.  Then - in my childhood, in the dawn  Of a most stormy life - was drawn  From every depth of good and ill  The mystery which binds me still:  From the torrent, or the fountain,  From the red cliff of the mountain,  From the sun that round me rolled  In its autumn tint of gold,  From the lightning in the sky  As it passed me flying by,  From the thunder and the storm,  And the cloud that took the form  (When the rest of Heaven was blue)  Of a demon in my view.   Edgar Allan Poe   A Dream Within A Dream   TAKE this kiss upon the brow!  And, in parting from you now,  Thus much let me avow --  You are not wrong, who deem  That my days have been a dream;  Yet if Hope has flown away  In a night, or in a day,  In a vision, or in none,  Is it therefore the less gone?  All that we see or seem  Is but a dream within a dream.  I stand amid the roar  Of a surf-tormented shore,  And I hold within my hand  Grains of the golden sand --  How few! yet how they creep  Through my fingers to the deep,  While I weep -- while I weep!  O God! can I not grasp  Them with a tighter clasp?  O God! can I not save  One from the pitiless wave?  Is all that we see or seem  Is but a dream within a dream .  Edgar Allan Poe   Again And Again And Again   You said the anger would come back just as the love did. I have a black look I do not like. It is a mask I try on. I migrate toward it and its frog sits on my lips and defecates. It is old. It is also a pauper. I have tried to keep it on a diet. I give it no unction. There is a good look that I wear like a blood clot. I have sewn it over my left breast. I have made a vocation of it. Lust has taken plant in it and I have placed you and your child at its milk tip. Oh the blackness is murderous and the milk tip is brimming and each machine is working and I will kiss you when I cut up one dozen new men and you will die somewhat, again and again  Anne sexton    A Birthday Present   What is this, behind this veil, is it ugly, is it beautiful? It is shimmering, has it breasts, has it edges?  I am sure it is unique, I am sure it is what I want. When I am quiet at my cooking I feel it looking, I feel it thinking  'Is this the one I am too appear for, Is this the elect one, the one with black eye-pits and a scar?  Measuring the flour, cutting off the surplus, Adhering to rules, to rules, to rules.  Is this the one for the annunciation? My god, what a laugh!'  But it shimmers, it does not stop, and I think it wants me. I would not mind if it were bones, or a pearl button.  I do not want much of a present, anyway, this year. After all I am alive only by accident.  I would have killed myself gladly that time any possible way. Now there are these veils, shimmering like curtains,  The diaphanous satins of a January window White as babies' bedding and glittering with dead breath. O ivory!  It must be a tusk there, a ghost column. Can you not see I do not mind what it is.  Can you not give it to me? Do not be ashamed--I do not mind if it is small.  Do not be mean, I am ready for enormity. Let us sit down to it, one on either side, admiring the gleam,  The glaze, the mirrory variety of it. Let us eat our last supper at it, like a hospital plate.  I know why you will not give it to me, You are terrified  The world will go up in a shriek, and your head with it, Bossed, brazen, an antique shield,  A marvel to your great-grandchildren. Do not be afraid, it is not so.  I will only take it and go aside quietly. You will not even hear me opening it, no paper crackle,  No falling ribbons, no scream at the end. I do not think you credit me with this discretion.  If you only knew how the veils were killing my days. To you they are only transparencies, clear air.  But my god, the clouds are like cotton. Armies of them. They are carbon monoxide.  Sweetly, sweetly I breathe in, Filling my veins with invisibles, with the million  Probable motes that tick the years off my life. You are silver-suited for the occasion. O adding machine-----  Is it impossible for you to let something go and have it go whole? Must you stamp each piece purple,  Must you kill what you can? There is one thing I want today, and only you can give it to me.  It stands at my window, big as the sky. It breathes from my sheets, the cold dead center  Where split lives congeal and stiffen to history. Let it not come by the mail, finger by finger.  Let it not come by word of mouth, I should be sixty By the time the whole of it was delivered, and to numb to use it.  Only let down the veil, the veil, the veil. If it were death  I would admire the deep gravity of it, its timeless eyes. I would know you were serious.  There would be a nobility then, there would be a birthday. And the knife not carve, but enter  Pure and clean as the cry of a baby, And the universe slide from my side.   Sylvia Plath   A Fairly Sad Tale   I think that I shall never know Why I am thus, and I am so. Around me, other girls inspire In men the rush and roar of fire, The sweet transparency of glass, The tenderness of April grass, The durability of granite; But me- I don't know how to plan it. The lads I've met in Cupid's deadlock Were- shall we say?- born out of wedlock. They broke my heart, they stilled my song, And said they had to run along, Explaining, so to sop my tears, First came their parents or careers. But ever does experience Deny me wisdom, calm, and sense! Though she's a fool who seeks to capture The twenty-first fine, careless rapture, I must go on, till ends my rope, Who from my birth was cursed with hope. A heart in half is chaste, archaic; But mine resembles a mosaic- The thing's become ridiculous! Why am I so? Why am I thus?   Dorothy Parker    Sex Without Love   How do they do it, the ones who make love without love? Beautiful as dancers, gliding over each other like ice-skaters over the ice, fingers hooked inside each other's bodies, faces red as steak, wine, wet as the children at birth whose mothers are going to give them away. How do they come to the come to the come to the God come to the still waters, and not love the one who came there with them, light rising slowly as steam off their joined skin? These are the true religious, the purists, the pros, the ones who will not accept a false Messiah, love the priest instead of the God. They do not mistake the lover for their own pleasure, they are like great runners: they know they are alone with the road surface, the cold, the wind, the fit of their shoes, their over-all cardio- vascular health--just factors, like the partner in the bed, and not the truth, which is the single body alone in the universe against its own best time . Sharon Olds   General Review Of The Sex Situation   Woman wants monogamy; Man delights in novelty. Love is woman's moon and sun; Man has other forms of fun. Woman lives but in her lord; Count to ten, and man is bored. With this the gist and sum of it, What earthly good can come of it?   Dorothy Parker   And Death Shall Have No Dominion   And death shall have no dominion. Dead mean naked they shall be one With the man in the wind and the west moon; When their bones are picked clean and the clen bones gone, They shall have stars at elbow and foot; Though they go mad they shall be sane, Though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; Though lovers be lost love shall not; And death shall have no dominion.  And death shall have no dominion. Under the windings of the sea They lying long shall not die windily; Twisting on racks when sinews give way, Strapped to a wheel, yet they shall not break; Faith in their hands shall snap in two, And the unicorn evils run them through; Split all ends up they shan't crack; And death shall have no dominion.  And death shall have no dominion. No more may gulls cry at their ears Or waves break loud on the seashores; Where blew a flower may a flower no more Lift its head to the blows of the rain; Through they be mad and dead as nails, Heads of the characters hammer through daisies; Break in the sun till the sun breaks down, And death shall have no dominion.   Dylan Thomas   Fuck Me   FUCK ME I'm all screwed up so FUCK ME.  FUCK ME and take out the garbage feed the cat and FUCK ME you can do it, I know you can.  FUCK ME and theorize about Sado Masochism's relationship to classical philosophy tell me how this stimulates the fabric of most human relationships, I love that kind of pointless intellectualism so do it again and FUCK ME.  Stop being logical stop contemplating the origins of evil and the beauty of death this is not a TV movie about Plato sex life, this is FUCK ME so FUCK ME  It's the pause that refreshes just add water and FUCK ME.  I wrote this so I'd have a good excuse to say "FUCK ME" over and over and over so I could get a lot of attention and look, it worked! So thank you thank you and fuck ME.   Maggie Estep   Crazy Jane On God   That lover of a night Came when he would, Went in the dawning light Whether I would or no; Men come, men go; All things remain in God.  Banners choke the sky; Men-at-arms tread; Armoured horses neigh In the narrow pass: All things remain in God.  Before their eyes a house That from childhood stood Uninhabited, ruinous, Suddenly lit up From door to top: All things remain in God.  I had wild Jack for a lover; Though like a road That men pass over My body makes no moan But sings on: All things remain in God.   William Butler Yeats   Much Madness is divinest Sense   Much Madness is divinest Sense - To a discerning Eye - Much Sense - the starkest Madness - `Tis the Majority In this, as All, prevail - Assent - and you are sane - Demur - you`re straightaway dangerous - And handled with a Chain -   Emily Dickinson   Coal   I is the total black, being spoken from the earth's inside. There are many kinds of open how a diamond comes into a knot of flame how sound comes into a word, colored by who pays what for speaking.  Some words are open like a diamond on glass windows singing out within the passing crash of sun Then there are words like stapled wagers in a perforated book--buy and sign and tear apart-- and come whatever wills all chances the stub remains an ill-pulled tooth with a ragged edge. Some words live in my throat breeding like adders. Others know sun seeking like gypsies over my tongue to explode through my lips like young sparrows bursting from shell. Some words bedevil me.  Love is a word, another kind of open. As the diamond comes into a knot of flame I am Black because I come from the earth's inside now take my word for jewel in the open light.   Audre Lorde   Democracy   Democracy will not come Today, this year Nor ever Through compromise and fear.  I have as much right  As the other fellow has To stand On my two feet  And own the land.  I tire so of hearing people say,  Let things take their course. Tomorrow is another day. I do not need my freedom when I'm dead. I cannot live on tomorrow's bread.  Freedom Is a strong seed Planted In a great need.  I live here, too. I want freedom Just as you.   Langston Hughes   Lovesong   He loved her and she loved him.  His kisses sucked out her whole past and future or tried to  He had no other appetite  She bit him she gnawed him she sucked  She wanted him complete inside her  Safe and sure forever and ever  Their little cries fluttered into the curtains   Her eyes wanted nothing to get away  Her looks nailed down his hands his wrists his elbows  He gripped her hard so that life  Should not drag her from that moment  He wanted all future to cease  He wanted to topple with his arms round her  Off that moment's brink and into nothing  Or everlasting or whatever there was   Her embrace was an immense press  To print him into her bones  His smiles were the garrets of a fairy palace  Where the real world would never come  Her smiles were spider bites  So he would lie still till she felt hungry  His words were occupying armies  Her laughs were an assassin's attempts  His looks were bullets daggers of revenge  His glances were ghosts in the corner with horrible secrets  His whispers were whips and jackboots  Her kisses were lawyers steadily writing  His caresses were the last hooks of a castaway  Her love-tricks were the grinding of locks  And their deep cries crawled over the floors  Like an animal dragging a great trap  His promises were the surgeon's gag  Her promises took the top off his skull  She would get a brooch made of it  His vows pulled out all her sinews  He showed her how to make a love-knot  Her vows put his eyes in formalin  At the back of her secret drawer  Their screams stuck in the wall   Their heads fell apart into sleep like the two halves  Of a lopped melon, but love is hard to stop   In their entwined sleep they exchanged arms and legs  In their dreams their brains took each other hostage   In the morning they wore each other's face   Ted Hughes   A Negro Love Song  Seen my lady home las' night,  Jump back, honey, jump back. Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight, Jump back, honey, jump back. Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh, Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye, An' a smile go flittin' by -- Jump back, honey, jump back.  Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine, Jump back, honey, jump back.  Mockin'-bird was singin' fine, Jump back, honey, jump back. An' my hea't was beatin' so, When I reached my lady's do', Dat I could n't ba' to go -- Jump back, honey, jump back.  Put my ahm aroun' huh wais', Jump back, honey, jump back. Raised huh lips an' took a tase, Jump back, honey, jump back. Love me, honey, love me true? Love me well ez I love you? An' she answe'd, "'Cose I do"-- Jump back, honey, jump back.   Paul Laurence Dunbar   THE CUNT   Too right A cunt For treating you like shit Today Yesterday And tomorrow too   David Harkins   Bitch I Remember   In the peace you finally bring me, bitch I still remember how I got here. I had him. You took him. I wanted what we had back. I remember lying in bed one night calling myself incomplete for letting him come to you, Bitch. Then you put him down and he doubled over in pain, asking me to help. How baby? Find her please he cried. She's the only thing can stop my pain now, that Bitch. I went looking for you. You remember? Brought you back to my house for my man to make him well - Miss Bitch. I didn't want you, but I needed to know what made him love you, need you so much. Now as we work together to keep you, I don't need him at all. Yeah - Bitch I remember!   Karen Schley   What Are Big Girls Made Of?   The construction of a woman: a woman is not made of flesh  of bone and sinew  belly and breasts, elbows and liver and toe.  She is manufactured like a sports sedan.  She is retooled, refitted and redesigned  every decade.  Cecile had been seduction itself in college.  She wriggled through bars like a satin eel,  her hips and ass promising, her mouth pursed  in the dark red lipstick of desire.   She visited in '68 still wearing skirts  tight to the knees, dark red lipstick,  while I danced through Manhattan in mini skirt,  lipstick pale as apricot milk,  hair loose as a horse's mane. Oh dear,  I thought in my superiority of the moment,  whatever has happened to poor Cecile?  She was out of fashion, out of the game,  disqualified, disdained, dis-  membered from the club of desire.   Look at pictures in French fashion  magazines of the 18th century:  century of the ultimate lady  fantasy wrought of silk and corseting.  Paniers bring her hips out three feet  each way, while the waist is pinched  and the belly flattened under wood.  The breasts are stuffed up and out  offered like apples in a bowl.  The tiny foot is encased in a slipper  never meant for walking.  On top is a grandiose headache:  hair like a museum piece, daily  ornamented with ribbons, vases,  grottoes, mountains, frigates in full  sail, balloons, baboons, the fancy  of a hairdresser turned loose.  The hats were rococo wedding cakes  that would dim the Las Vegas strip.  Here is a woman forced into shape  rigid exoskeleton torturing flesh:  a woman made of pain.   How superior we are now: see the modern woman  thin as a blade of scissors.  She runs on a treadmill every morning,  fits herself into machines of weights  and pulleys to heave and grunt,  an image in her mind she can never  approximate, a body of rosy  glass that never wrinkles,  never grows, never fades. She  sits at the table closing her eyes to food  hungry, always hungry:  a woman made of pain.   A cat or dog approaches another,  they sniff noses. They sniff asses.  They bristle or lick. They fall  in love as often as we do,  as passionately. But they fall  in love or lust with furry flesh,  not hoop skirts or push up bras  rib removal or liposuction.  It is not for male or female dogs  that poodles are clipped  to topiary hedges.   If only we could like each other raw.  If only we could love ourselves  like healthy babies burbling in our arms.  If only we were not programmed and reprogrammed  to need what is sold us.  Why should we want to live inside ads?  Why should we want to scourge our softness  to straight lines like a Mondrian painting?  Why should we punish each other with scorn  as if to have a large ass were worse than being greedy or mean?  When will women not be compelled to view their bodies as science projects, gardens to be weeded, dogs to be trained? When will a woman cease to be made of pain?   Marge Piercy   Resumé  Razors pain you;  Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns aren't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live.

      Here is my mantra…. Or song that I listen to when things go bad, I get down, and want to give up.    That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say You're ridin' high in April, shot down in May But I know I'm gonna change that tune When I'm back on top, back on top in June  I said that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks stompin' on a dream But I don't let it, let it get me down 'cause this fine old world, it keeps spinnin' around  I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing Each time I find myself flat on my face I pick myself up and get back in the race  That's life (that's life), I tell you I can't deny it I thought of quitting, baby, but my heart just ain't gonna buy it And if I didn't think it was worth one single try I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly  I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king I've been up and down and over and out and I know one thing Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face I just pick myself up and get back in the race  That's life (that's life), that's life and I can't deny it Many times I thought of cuttin' out but my heart won't buy it But if there's nothin' shakin' come this here July I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball a-and die  My, my!   I didn’t go to work today, who knows I may be fired.  Sometimes I just wake up and I can’t go anywhere, all I want to do is sleep.  I can sleep for hours, besides sex, sleep is one of my favorite things to do.  Really, I don’t feel that great today, but I kinda just feel overwhelmed too.  So many bills, so much to do, sometimes I feel like Im drowning in a lake and Jason Vorhees is swimming closer with a knife, and Im so bogged down from weights that I keep sinking…. Deeper and deeper….    Im not depressed really, just kinda numb.  Maybe I should write some poetry?      I want to sleep the day away Hell what difference does it make? I’ll dream away to yesterday   I think instead I will share with you some poems I have written.  Poetry is truth, it is like having a mirror into someones soul.  Maybe you will think my poems are cheesy, well hell, some of them are, but Im gonna put them out there anyway….    This poem I wrote in high school (can anyone say warning signs?).   I actually turned this into a teacher in a poetry class.    Silent Death  | I yell out for help in the distance yet my response is silence and the sounds of lonely echoes Reflecting back upon my soul’s calling I pry open my frozen eyes So I might be able to notice Some sign of desolate hope Am I totally blind? For all I can see is darkness….. In my decomposition I try to locate strength I want to reach out Yet to my despair I find nothing solid to grasp Only chilling air surrounds me In silent slow motion I fall The cement feels cool against my crashing carcass And the earth stings my bloodied lip Life is so cold and uncaring I can not fight it anymore I feel the pain and then numbness And I become one with the nothingness….. Here is another poem I wrote in high school   Reflection   You observe the fear in her eyes And try to ignore her ominous presence Passing whispers of “she’s crazy” “she’s insane” you pretend not to notice disregard the fires that you see the twisted face hammering eyes with unseen pain reminding you of something  you lost at the tip of your tongue years ago  in passing you always turn your head as not to stare yet not this time a strange twist of fate  results in the locking of eyes seducing you to stare into the heart of all her obscenities and laughing anger  she laughs at you “Why pretend anymore?” “I will never go away” with that it is all over you can bear her no longer you snap, so with shaking hands your reflection in the mirror you shatter  Here is a poem I wrote after my failed marriage   Shame no more    A sharp sting Glides across my face With delicate needles That laugh at my sensitivity  Only property No identity A Mrs. Not a separate human  He has broken me in, Like old work boots You see, it took time to learn this. The rare art of hiding Bruised arms  In 90 degree heat  When I look in the mirror I can only see shadows For the child so lost  And abandoned by her family Has shriveled into a tiny ball And does not live here anymore  He has taken my family My friends, my pride And my soul But I can still feel a heart Beating beneath the layers I now pretend to be It beats in hiding Awaiting the time when the child  Will wake up And reclaim life As she is entitled.   Here is a poem I wrote for my brother… about 10 years ago   Brother of Mine    Years of pretending Aching inside  Blue from exhaustion. To survive We viewed life only in the present To warp reality from the truth.  Many times my eyes rested upon Your broken face, Steaming with confusion  How did it feel to be labeled a sinner? Did you cry inside like I did While being strangled by authority? Did your sea of bruises hurt more on the inside Than at the fleshy surface?  Now we forget Or claim temporary sanity Living adult lives While lurking in the shadows Never looking back At our screaming souls  We profess personal effigy To prove wrong The destiny decided for us In our teenage fate  Day after day Beat upon  Our fragile teenage minds We had no choice but to submit  Now no one holds us hostage Besides a tainted history For if a child does not forgive their abuser They never truly become adults All hostages must forgive their captures In order to be truly free  We must forgive To grow up   Here is my favorite poem of all time….Richard Corey by Edwin Arlington Robinson.  I fell in love with this poem in high school, and it still sends chills up my spine to read it.   Richard Corey    WHENEVER Richard Cory went down town,	 We people on the pavement looked at him:	 He was a gentleman from sole to crown,	 Clean favored, and imperially slim.	 	 And he was always quietly arrayed,	5 And he was always human when he talked;	 But still he fluttered pulses when he said,	 "Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.	 	 And he was rich—yes, richer than a king,	 And admirably schooled in every grace:	10 In fine, we thought that he was everything	 To make us wish that we were in his place.	 	 So on we worked, and waited for the light,	 And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;	 And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,	15 Went home and put a bullet through his head.	  urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

       Okay, so Im feeling frisky again...so watch out!    As such some rad grrrls and I started a female collective blog “ urlLink Sexy Tomatoes ”. Debra describes it  “Sexy & informative, easy and fun reading for all. Basically a little crazy and some personal stuff is reading along the line of what might be found is classic erotic literature, but not smut”.   Here is our group of sexperts....  urlLink Debra    urlLink Varla    urlLink Jamie    urlLink Kitten Kat Charise The Tease    urlLink PunkAssBitch     Here is our intent  Vadergrrrl & I are working on building up a collective of thoughts, ideas, and info about sexual liberation and female sexuality, what the hope of this is to not only share information with others, but to make it interesting as well... which means while we're not looking to see smut, we are looking for sexy talk to spice up the facts and stories that will be shared.     At Sexy Tomatoes! Grrrls kick ass and we're going to prove it!    So, while Im busy writing my first post for Sexy Tomatoes on the joys of female orgasm, I will leave you with this tantalizing piece, submitted to me via email.  I didn’t write this, it was sent to me by another blogger…. Im not sure if he wants credit or not, so I will let him decide in the comments….    How to please your man with Oral Sex  Lesson 1 -- The Basics The most important thing about sucking a man's cock (or anything else sexual, in my opinion) is to be totally into it. You have to convince him that you absolutely adore what you're doing, can't get enough of it, would die without it. Be dirty, filthy, a slut, a whore (but a high class, expensive one, of course, willing to give it to him for free, just this once). After all, most guys' ideas about sex were formed by watching porn movies -- you may want to check a few out to get the hang of what men fantasize about. But the main thing is, make love to his cock, worship it...don't act like you're just trying to get it over with. You have to get inside his head, fuck his brain while your sucking his cock. Look up at him a lot, whenever you can, with your best "fuck me" look (c'mon girls, you know how to do that!). Tell him with your eyes how hot this makes you, and how much you're enjoying it. Lesson 2 -- Foreplay You really want to take your time with this part...a nice, slow build-up will pay big dividends later. Look at him and ever so slowly circle your lips with your tongue. Then take a nice long trip around his body with your mouth, your tongue, your hands, your breasts...play with his nipples, his bellybutton, his inner thighs, his fingers, his toes, anything and everything. I particularly like licking and sucking on a  middle finger, very suggestively, eyes locked on his. Move your mouth to his ear, breathe hotly, lash your tongue around inside....and then whisper something slow and shocking, like "I'm gonna suck you off....". When you finally arrive between his legs, stay away from his cock at first. Concentrate first on his balls, licking them, sucking them gently into your mouth, getting them nice and wet. When you're  ready, begin tracing up and down the shaft with your tongue, or nibble on it with your lips. Flick your tongue against it quickly for a change of pace...there's a niiiiiice sensitive spot just below the head, on the underside. Sometimes he'll get a little droplet of pre-cum on the tip of his cock...it's fun to play with it, touching it with your tongue and pulling away. Maybe a little silvery strand of it will come away with your tongue. Nibble for awhile on the head with your lips before you suck him into your mouth....circle it lazily with your tongue. Some men think it's sexy if you kind of slap it wetly against your outstretched tongue, or you can rub it around on your face. You might also slide his dick between your breasts, moving up and down on it, pressing them together with your hands. Lesson 3 -- Wetness Never forget, everything should be wet, wet, wet!! Saliva everywhere! His cock should be dripping and glistening with moisture. Your mouth and lips and cheeks and hair should be wet. I think it's sexy sometimes to let saliva drip down from your mouth onto the head of his cock, and then stroke it with your hand, or just slurp it back into your mouth. If you're really feeling nasty, you can even spit on it and then attack it with your mouth, sucking him quick and hard...this is fun sometimes and helps get across the impression that you're being driven absolutely insane with lust, in grave danger of losing control, rushing out the door, and offering to fuck every male on the planet! Lesson 4 -- No Teeth! In my experience, most guys don't like teeth marks on their prized possessions. Maybe a playful little nibble now and then, but mostly, I think your mouth should feel like a nice, tight, wet pussy, only better (after all, your vagina doesn't have a tongue in it and can't suck on him as nicely as your mouth can). So open your mouth wide and purse your lips around him...guys love the sight of your lips pressed around him and you cheeks hollowing as his hard cock slides in and out of your mouth, your tongue teasing him on each stroke. Look up at him and treat him to the sight of his massive, throbbing cock buried in your face, your lips stretched tightly around it. Lesson 5 -- Rhythm Another key, once you really get down to business, is to establish a nice, steady rhythm, in and out, in and out, in and out....Not too fast, take your time, but set a pace and stick to it. Let him know that you don't care how long it takes....you'd love to suck his cock until hell freezes. After awhile you can gradually accelerate. Make nice, wet slurping noises as you suck him. By the way, you don't have to take him too deep at first, but most guys seem to like it so you might want to practice a little. Personally, I don't mind letting him nudge the back of my throat a little. Moving your fingers and/or fingernails on the  shaft in rhythm with your sucking is also nice if your mouth is too small to take him deeply. This is one time when smaller cocks have they're advantages! Lesson 6 -- Tease!! Don't you dare let him cum too soon! You have to TEASE!! If you think he's getting close (most guys are dead giveaways -- they're thighs tremble), ease off, take him out of your mouth, and  flick your tongue against the head of his cock, looking up and smiling teasingly....or you can nibble on the shaft, tickle or suck on his balls, almost anything. This will give your jaw muscles time to relax, in case you were wondering. This is also another good time to take him between your breasts...or you can rub the head of his cock against your nipples (mine are always as hard as pebbles at this point!) When he calms down a bit, you can pick up where you left off. Make a game out of it....se if you can get him to a fever pitch, just on the brink of cumming, and keep him there as long as you can, ready to explode like a geyser! But above all, stay in control. Don't let him grab your head and start fucking your mouth (that's the subject of an advanced lesson!) Let him know that you're in charge, that you won't disappoint him, and that his reward is coming, so to speak. You can taunt him with your voice, too....ask him if he wants to cum, or if he likes what you're doing to him. Or just give him little moans and gasps now and then, to make him think you're about to cum yourself just from sucking him off (I almost did once, I swear!). Lesson 7 -- Don't Forget the Nether Region Some guys will deny this, but most males love to have a girl play around with their butts. During foreplay, if you're the adventurous type and he's squeaky clean, you can lick around his asshole or even stiffen your tongue and do a little gentle (or not so gentle) probing. When you suck on his cock, a wet finger easing into his ass can work wonders...but you may want to save this for the....uh....moment of truth. Some guys go right over the edge just from the thought that the girl he always thought was so sweet and innocent could be so incredibly nasty! Lesson 8 -- The Grand Finale Once you've teased him until he's literally begging for mercy, it's time for the main event! I like to release him at this point, look into his eyes adoringly, and whisper in no uncertain terms exactly what I'm about to do. Tell him something like "I want you to cum", or "I want to taste you"....accentuate every syllable. Or ask him if he'd like to cum in your mouth, or all over your face, or wherever. Don't mince words. Now, you can be aggressive...plunge your mouth down on him, suck him hard and fast...use your hands, your fingers, squeeze his balls, tease is asshole, or slide that finger into him....in short, pull out all the stops. He's utterly helpless, he can't stop you, all he can do is let it happen. And don't be afraid....this is the best part, that feeling at the moment his balls tighten up, filled with hot cum, and his cock lurches and expands suddenly in your mouth, and his whole body is taut like a bowstring! I always hear a drum roll in my head at this point. Lesson 9 -- The Truth about Cum I have never met a man who wasn't convinced that his cum was a combination of honey, facial cream, and the nectar of the gods. You must think of it the same way. You crave it, must have it, will kill for it, the more the merrier! You want to drown in it, play in it, let it cover you, all hot, creamy and sexy. As for the taste, it really doesn't taste like much...kind of salty, maybe, but not offensive. No matter....as far as he knows, you think it's absolutely heavenly! He may want to cum in your mouth, and that's OK (I'm assuming, by the way, that this guy is certifiably disease free...if he's not, you should never have gotten this far!). But most guys seem to get off on  watching it spurt out on your face, on your tongue, in your hair, on your breasts, etc., etc. Soooo, give him what he wants, with a look of rapture on your sweet lips as his cum splashes on you, oozes down your chin, drips down onto your nipple. Grip his cock with one hand and stroke him rhthmically as he cums, unless he's already doing this himself (which is kinda sexy to watch). Some guys cum in big, thick, strong spurts (especially if you followed these instructions to the letter!), while in other cases, it might just kind of ooze out. The more he cums, the prouder he'll be of himself, so be appropriately awestruck at his monster load of love juice. Let your tongue play in it, swirl it around, collect it with your fingers, suck gobs of it into your mouth and then let it ooze out between your lips while you gaze up at him. You can swallow it if you want (after playing with it awhile) but you don't have to....just don't spit it out like it was disgusting or something. Lesson 10 -- The Aftermath As his orgasm subsides, you can suck him back into your mouth, but be gentle....he may be a bit sensitive at this point. Otherwise, content yourself with licking up any little traces of cum, or just lazily run your tongue up and down the shaft, or suck on his balls...take your time, don't be in a hurry. Leave his cum on your face, maybe running your tongue around your lips, licking at it or rubbing it with a finger. If he's half a man, he'll yank you up to him and shower you with kisses and tell you what a goddess you are. Just smile like the Mona Lisa and ask him innocently if he liked it. And be sure to tell him how much you love the taste of his cum.  At this point, he should be ready to reciprocate, and if he's not, you should seriously consider throwing him out on his lazy, selfish butt! Trust me, if you do this right, he will be your slave, and all of his  friends will be waiting in line for their turn!      urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

Sometimes, music can bring you further down, other times it can inspire you and help you keep going.  This was the case when I came home and found my son had downloaded the song by Tupac Shakur “Dear Momma|”.  I have listened to that song over and over, this weekend, sometimes in tears other times with love and inspiration.

          Let’s have a black celebration Black celebration Tonight  To celebrate the fact That we’ve seen the back Of another black day  I look to you How you carry on When all hope is gone Can’t you see  Your optimistic eyes Seem like paradise To someone like Me  I want to take you In my arms Forgetting all I couldn’t do today  Black celebration Black celebration Tonight  To celebrate the fact That we’ve seen the back Of another black day  I look to you And your strong belief Me, I want relief Tonight  Consolation I want so much Want to feel your touch Tonight  Take me in your arms Forgetting all you couldn’t do today  Black celebration I’ll drink to that Black celebration Tonight    -Black Celebration Depeche Mode       My Black Celebration  I have suffered from fits of depression since my teenage years, I remember black periods of laying on the bed in my room, lights off, my stereo playing Depeche Mode’s Black Celebration album over, and over….  I would feel heavy, tired, unable to move, the world felt black, I felt apathy, overwhelm, failure and sadness….   Suicidide Solution  Many times as a teenager I thought about suicide, I remember one particular sunny day, crying in my room, holding a bottle of pills and a glass of water, and wanting badly to end the pain.  As I was about to swallow down these pills, I could hear children outside my window laughing…. And I decided to keep living.  When I started drinking, the depression and suicidal thoughts would overwhelm me, and there was several times I cut up my wrists, stabbed myself with things, or did other forms of abuse to myself.  Im embarrassed now as an adult at the spectacle I would case.  I wrote, a lot, too many poems to count, all with black themes, suicidal messages, and deep sorrow and sadness.    depression - a mental state characterized by a pessimistic sense of inadequacy and a despondent lack of activity        Is there no way out of the mind?    Sylvia Plath     The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.    Sylvia Plath    Black Bouts  Bouts with deep depression have followed me through adulthood, like an unwanted ghost.  Always lingering around me ready to overwhelm.  I had a serious case of depression right after graduating from UC Berkeley.  I felt like Dustin Hoffman in the graduate but worse.  During college, I became exposed to Sylvia Plath, a poet who committed suicide in 1963.  Sylvia wrote the semi-autobiographical book “the Bell Jar”, and I would identify with no book as strongly in my lifetime.  In the book, a smart, creative writer goes to college and realizes that college is a place to meet husbands or training factory for women to become secretaries, teachers, or typists.  I identified with Sylvia as she was also a struggling single mother, smart college graduate, who wrote suffered through depression.  I realized after graduating from Berkeley top 3 percent, that it DIDN’T matter how frigging smart I was, my lot in life was to be that of a secretary or typist.  Careers of which I have never been able to escape from their crushing glass ceiling.  This still saddens me to no end, I want to do so much more, feel like my degree meant so much more….   The only difference from being in a rut and being dead is, that when you are dead, you don't mind when they throw dirt in your face.    --- Author Unknown    "the bell jar hung, suspended, a few feet above my head. I was open to the circulating air."  – Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar    The Fog  Today, I feel depressed, it could be because Im on my period and my hormones are going crazy, or it could be because I stopped taking anti-depressants a week ago, or it could be because I feel alone, confused, unsure of where I am going in the sea called life.  I feel as if a dark cloud has descended on me, surrounding my body, and I cant see past it.  My eyes feel heavy, my jaw line clenched.   "The sickness rolled through me in great waves. After each wave it would fade away and leave me limp as a wet leaf and shivering all over and then I would feel it rising up in me again, and the glittering white torture chamber tiles under my feet and over my head and all four sides closed in and squeezed me to pieces."   –Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar    Temporary (hopefully) funk  Im trying to pull myself out of this funk, and I hope it will end as fast as it came on.  Today, I am not able to post anything happy or sexual…. My world seems very dark today, and the Bell Jar hovers around me.     Depression Symptoms 1.	You cried at the end of "The Little Mermaid".  2.	You feel less attractive than mayonnaise.  3.	You know how to say "suicide" in 15 languages  TREATMENT: 1.	A trip to Disneyland!  2.	A career in the arts.  3.	Throw away your copy of The Bell Jar.     Picasso  This was his Blue Period, so called because most of these paintings were dominated by various shades of blue, heigthening their mood of isolation and despair.     Quotes from Van Gogh on Depression      I might only succeed in this, if that heavy depression because everything I undertook failed, that torrent of reproaches which I have heard and felt, if it might be taken from me, and if there might be given to me both the opportunity...  But I am so angry with myself now because I cannot do what I should like to do, and at such a moment one feels as if one were lying bound hand and foot a the bottom of a deep, dark well, utterly helpless.    Sylvia Plath  (October 27, 1932 - February 11, 1963)  was an American poet, author, and essayist.  She showed early literary promise, publishing her first poem at the age of 8; her father, a college professor and noted authority on the subject of bees, died at around the same time. In her junior year at Smith College, Plath made what was to be the first of several suicide attempts: this was later to be detailed in the autobiographical novel, The Bell Jar, published in 1963.  It is argued that she was affected by manic depression, and, notably, she was a resident of McLean Hospital.  She married the English poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and published her first collection of poetry, The Colossus, in England in 1960.  She and Ted Hughes settled for a while in a small village in Devon, but separated less than two years after the birth of their first child, and Plath returned to London with their two children, Frieda and Nicholas, in tow. The winter of 1962/1963 was one of the harshest in living memory. On February 11, 1963, ill, low on money, Sylvia Plath committed suicide in her kitchen by gas asphyxiation. She is buried in the churchyard at Heptonstall, West Yorkshire.    The Catcher in the Rye  written by J. D. Salinger    Published in 1951, the novel remains controversial today (it was the 13th most frequently challenged book from 1990-2000, according to the ALA [1]) and its hero, Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage angst.  In the book, seventeen-year-old Holden Caulfield, writing from a mental institution, relates his experiences of the previous year (when he was 16).    Quotes from Catcher in the Rye   "The cars zoomed by, brakes screeched all over the place, his parents paid no attention to him, and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing 'If a body catch a body coming through the rye.' It made me feel better. It made me feel not so depressed any more"    "Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I mean-except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff-I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy"     Kurt battled with drug dependency, and depression all his adult life    Creativity and Depression and Manic Depression  Studies of Writers and Artists. "Reports published in Smooth Sailing on talks by Kay Redfield Jamison at symposiums co-sponsored by DRADA." Studies include John Keats, Virginia Woolf, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and Robert Louis Stevenson.  John Keats  Despite his untimely death from tuberculosis at age 25, Keats produced some of the greatest poetry in our language or any other. As seems common among artists with symptoms of manic-depressive illness, he did much of his finest work in a great burst of creative activity (during nine months in 1819).  It is evident from Keats's notes and letters that he was subject to violent mood swings. "I am in that temper," he once wrote, "that if I were under water I would scarcely kick to come to the top." But he fought against his illness: "I shall get over my indolent fits."  Trained as a surgeon, Keats embellished his surgery lecture notes with many impromptu sketches in the margins—evidence of his wide-ranging interests, and also of his mercurial nature. Inability to maintain a steady mood characterized his life; though by this own description he was sometimes "lax, unemployed and unmeridian'd," his doctor once diagnosed him as suffering "the too great excitement of poetry."   Virginia Woolf   Virginia Woolf believed that her "madness" inspired her and made her a better writer. Her disease probably gave rise to the nontraditional narrative techniques and definitions of reality in her stream-of-consciousness style of writing. A friend said, "A dull moment in her company was not likely . . . her mind was a rich kingdom to itself and her going was the end of an age."  Virginia Woolf wrote two suicide notes telling of her certainty that she would become manic and that she "cannot fight it." In both notes she expressed gratitude to her husband. She believed she owed the happiness in her life to her husband and she did not want to spoil his life. She wrote that they "were happy until this disease came on." On March 28, 1941, sensing the beginning of another manic episode and a flight into madness, she drowned herself.    F. Scott Fitzgerald  In 1936, Scott Fitzgerald published in Esquire magazine a series of three essays dealing directly with depression, which he was experiencing. The first, The Crack-Up, was published in February; the second, Handle with Care, in March; and the third, Putting It Together, in April. Dr. Jamison described these essays as "dark, dreadful, and utterly desolate," with an enormous "sense of bleakness." They vividly express the feelings Scott Fitzgerald experienced during an intense depression. Because he wrote them during it, not afterward, they have great clarity and impact. He wrote "from the bone." He "hated the night and hated the day," and referred to himself as "a cracked plate." Anyone who has endured a severe depression can identify with those descriptions. "Difficulties nerve the Spirit of Man," he said; they focus the mind on concerns of life rather than letting it wander to darker thoughts. Keats often sank into a "profound disquiet which he could not or would not explain," in the words of a friend, caused by the "motion of the inland sea he loved so well."   urlLink  Creativity and Depression   Article by Meana Kasi discussing the link between creativity and depression from the perspective of "There is scientific evidence that the same people who are predisposed to creativity are also the ones who are most prone to suffer from depression. Oftentimes, this battle with depression may lead to suicide and/or drug/alcohol abuse as is evidenced by a long list of famous artists (painters, writers, musicians, etc) who have taken their own lives or battled addiction as a result of suffering from depression.   urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

      Thanks to  urlLink Trashman’s  “get your ass back in the kitchen” post, the wheels have been turning in my head.  Hrmmmmm.  Barefoot and pregos, well that was me at 19, and ah yes, this is when the adventure begins…..   Townie Party Crowd  After graduating high school in a small town, most move away.  They go to college, join the service, or otherwise get the hell out of here.  I stayed behind, my grades in high school sucked, so I had no choice to attend the local JC.  We called the JC, a big high school with ashtrays, which was pretty much what it was. The thing about this junior college was I had a reputation before I even started.  See, my Dad was a Dean there before he and my mom divorced and he moved away, and my step dad, well he was a Dean there too.  I could not go anywhere without some professor or administrator pointing at me and saying “so and so’s daughter”.  Talk about pressure.  What is any good standing chick supposed to do with this kind of reputation?  Rebel like hell.  Which is exactly what I did.  I started hanging with the party crowd, attending all the JC parties, smoking cigarettes all over campus, and basically slutting around the place.  Now, once you graduate high school, your little social circle dissipates.  In high school, I hung with the goth/punk/alternative crowd.  After graduation people leave, and you pretty much are stuck with who is left.  So, at JC I hung with the party crowd, which consisted of a motley crew assortment of characters; from preps, to mods, to jocks.  This is how I met my ex husband.  He was a total jock from an opposing high school.  Someone I never would have hung around in HS, but once you hit the party crowd age, we became fast, and best friends.  Another thing about this party crowd; we were an incestuous bunch.  Everyone slept together and dated each other.  That is how it worked, you would get drunk at a party and just fuck around.  Everyone was passed around the crew, no exceptions.     My hubby Easy E  My ex, lets call him Easy E, was a white trash jock who happened to have black skin.  We became fast friends, and he and I dated each other’s friends (dated = slept with) for about a year or so.  One night we got really, really drunk when we were hanging out together.  Next thing ya know, we were having sex.  Wham!  Don’t ask me why, but after that we kinda became boyfriend/girlfriend.  There was no romance, no courting, just a night of cheap sex and then Whamo, we were a couple.  Talk about a mismatch!  Plus the fact that we had been with each other’s friends a major recipe for disaster.  But alas, we were young, so we decided to move in together.  We got a house with some other couples and lived the party lifestyle dream.  Pool table in the house, 24/7 parties, rock n roll and sex all night.  Those were some wild days.  Easy E was working a local construction job, and he was also in the navy reserves.  Well, the partying got a little out of control, and Easy E was not able to make his monthly reserve duty due to a serious hangover.  He was given 2 choices; a dishonorable discharge, or full time naval duty.  He picked the latter.  Right around that same time, I stopped having my period.  This was odd, because I was taking birth control.  Easy E leaves for boot camp training, and I go to the hospital for a blood pregnancy test.  Well guess what?  Positive…. Positive for pregos.  I remember calling him at Treasure Island (when it was still a base) and telling him the news.  His response “ I guess we should get married”.     Hey Little Sister…. Shot gun!  Easy E had leave for a couple weeks before they were going to send him to Okinawa for a year.  We applied for a marriage license and headed to the courthouse.  I wore the nicest dress I had, which happened to be red.  Didn’t think of the significance at the time, but looking back I figure it happened for a reason.  Damn shot gun wedding and all.  So we said our “I do’s “ and new hubby headed to Okinawa, on a one year unaccompanied tour.  He promised to send for me soon, though the navy was not gonna foot the bill.  For a couple months I lived alone, pregnant with two cats.  I didn’t work, I think he supported me, but darn it, I really don’t recall.  I do remember him getting my ticket for Okinawa in October, when I was three months pregnant.  Packed up my two cats and all my 19 year old belongings and headed overseas.  For a life of a navy wife.   Okinawa Blues  I arrive in Okinawa ready for my new life, my hubby had a car for us and an apartment off base.  You could not get housing on base if you were unaccompanied.  No one under chief was allowed accompanied tours in Okinawa.  My hubby picks me up in our new car, a Z28, I’m thinking “great… I’m pregnant and I have to get in and out of this hotrod?… real nice”.  But what the fuck, we had a car.  Our apartment was about 5 minutes away from Futenma marine base where he was stationed.  It was a complex with about 10 units, 3 of those were co-workers who also had wives.  I remember tripping out because the windows were marbled and there were bars on them.  This wasn’t due to crime, there was virtually none in Okinawa.  This was due to the Monsoons.  I also remember the mat like floors and the teeny, tiny bathtub.  At least the toilet was western style, many toilets in Japan are these holes in the ground where you squat, me I wasn’t used to that, so I was thankful our apartment had a “western” one.     Young Navy Wives  I quickly made friends with the other navy wives who lived in our complex.  One was a southern belle from Arkansas, the other was a pregnant Puerto Rican from New York.  We exchanged recipes, sex stories, complaints, and all the other musings of new and very young housewives.  All of us were under 21.  I tried real hard to learn how to cook.  Every night I would make a new recipe and have it hot and ready for my husband when he walked in the door.  Most of the time they turned out to be disasters.  Some of them were okay.  My favorite recipes came from the Arkansas housewife.  She taught me how to cook potato salad, casserole, meat loaf.  She was awesome, and also not pregnant.     The Focker!  Another thing, in Okinawa the drinking age is whatever, so this was the first time my husband was able to legally party.  Now this is the age of Bobby Brown and NWA, so he was living up the player life.  He was also 20 years old, definitely too young to be married.  So, I spent many nights home alone, and pregnant, while he ventured out to the local clubs.  Being the young, hormone ridden grrrl that I was, this was not okay with me.  I remember locking his ass out, and him banging on the door drunk, begging me to let him in.  The fighting also started getting worse.  My Puerto Rican housewife friend told me that the next time he became abusive, I should scratch his face up and embarrass him at work.  Well, heeding the advice of my housewife friend, I did the deed.  The next time he tried to get physical with me, I reached up to his face with my claws extended, and clawed the shit out of him.  There were many a nights of fighting, this very typical in young navy families.  One night really stands out in my mind.  I was home alone with my cats and reading Stephan King’s the Stand.  This was all I did when I was pregnant, read books.  It was that or watch FenTV (military channel) and MASH over, and over.  Husband didn’t come home, I had attempted to make meatloaf in the crockpot.  Hell, it came out more like stew… lol.  After hours of waiting, I realized he wasn’t coming home after work, he was out.  So I deadbolted the door and went to bed.  After reading Stephan King, I was always scared of ghosts.  About 3:00 in the morning I hear this loud pounding and cursing.  “Bitch let me in”.  Real nice way to come home eh?  I do the reasonable thing, and ignore his ass for a while.  The pounding gets louder as well as the cursing.  When it gets to the point where I cant ignore it any longer I let his drunk ass in.  He starts to get belligerent and violent, so I run to the bedroom and lock the door.  Drunk ass can’t let well enough alone.  He starts pounding on the bedroom door screaming all sorts of drunk names at me.  I just ignore him.  Then I hear this loud pounding, the idiot starts chopping at the door with something.  He is yelling “I’m gonna kill you bitch”.  My mind flashes to the Shinning and Jack Nicholson’s “here’s Johnny”.  I curl up in the fetal position and start to cry, cry for my mom.  This is actually the weirdest part, since my mom was never there for me and kicked me out of the house as a teenager. Idiot husband breaks down the door with a golf club.  Total psycho style.  Luckily, by the grace of God, he sees me all pregnant and in a ball and decides to leave me alone.  That moment never left my heart.  I knew then, I needed to get out.  But being young and pregnant with no skills, I didn’t have much a choice.    San Diego Navy Housing  After my son was born, we moved to San Diego and eventually got navy housing.  Here I made a whole new batch of housewife friends.  We spent days together takings our babies to the park, gossiping, talking trash about our men, and doing other young mother things.  I was miserable.  My husband was a drunk abusive ass.  I sucked at being a housewife.  My cooking was terrible, and I hated cleaning.  Especially I hated cleaning up after a drunk who used to drink malt liquor out of a paper sack.  That image is still disgusting to me.  There were so many miserable nights in navy housing I could write an entire book.  Every night you would hear fighting, screaming, and domestic violence.  It was par for the course.  Navy Patrol would not even respond half the time.     Fuck This Shit!  After trying to be a good wife, my heart turned to stone.  I didn’t want to cook for him anymore and I became a vegetarian.  I didn’t want to have sex with him either.  The ass was still leaving me at home and chasing women.  Stupid fool used our calling card to court chicks, not thinking the numbers would show up on the phone bill.  I busted his ass, but I didn’t care much, because I had my heart set on getting out.  I didn’t want to be there anymore.  That is when I started attending junior college.  With the eye of the tiger enthusiasm I enrolled and studied my ass off.  I made Deans list year after year.  The school counselors started telling me I was smart and UC material.  Being a trashy navy wife, I never thought I would amount to anything, now here, I had a chance.  I applied for every scholarship I could get my hands on, and I got most of them too.  Then when I had enough credits, I applied to UCLA and UC Berkeley.  I was accepted at both, and I kissed the ground the day I got my letters.   Berkeley was also awarding me a leadership scholarship, and I found out that I could get student family housing there.  My prayers had been answered… I was finally free.    Free at Last!  Like the movie, the Color Purple, I packed up my things and my kid in my car, and headed north.  I pointed my two finger at my ex (just like Whoopie did to Danny Glover in the Color Purple) and I said “everything you have done to me will come back to you!”  and then…. I drove away.   I never looked back…. Kept driving til I started my new life as a single mother.  It was the end of my attempt to be a housewife.   Ahhhh Liberation!    Even though I left his ass, this was still my theme song.  In fact, it still kinda is.  At first I was afraid I was petrified Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong And I grew strong and I learned how to get along And now your back, from outta space I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face I should have changed that stupid lock I should have made you leave your key If I’d have known for just one second you’d be back to bother me Go on now go walk out the door Just turn around now cuz your not welcome anymore Weren’t you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye Did ya think I’d crumble Did ya think I’d crumble did ya think I’d lay down and die Oh no not i, I will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know ill stay alive Ive got all my life to live I’ve got all my love to give Ill survive I will survie hey hey (music) It took all the strength I had not to fall apart And tried so hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high And you see me..somebody new, Im not that chained up little person still in love with you And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free But now I’m saving all my loving for someone whos loving me Go on now go walk out the door Just turn around now cuz your not welcome anymore Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye Did ya think I’d crumble did ya think I’d lay down and die Oh no not I i will survive Oh as long as I know how to love I know ill stay alive Ive got all my life to live I’ve got all my love to give Ill survive..i will survive ohh go on now go Walk out the door just turn around now cuz your not welcome anymore ....continuing chorus......   urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

        Some strange and bizarre Saturday night questions and life observations.       Love  I still wonder if I believe in love.  Is there some light force that draws humans together for life?  There is caring and companionship, but is there this undying intense, fated feeling that lasts a lifetime?  I want to believe, but I question.  Maybe its because my parents divorced, maybe its because I am divorced.  Relationships seem to come and go, people walk into our lives one day, and then are gone the next.  The memories live forever, but the relationship ends and eventually is replaced.   Does destiny and fate play a part in things?   I have met people before who I feel like I have known for a lifetime.  I have also looked into the eyes of a future boyfriend and had that special spark, that snap, that moment in time where you know.  I think we were meant to be together, but it was obviously not meant for life.  Love dies..... or does it?   Friendship  Can human nature be trustworthy enough to really care for someone?  How do we not get so wrapped up in ourselves to really be there for anyone else?  I have a hard time trusting anyone.  It seems like when you trust someone they always hurt you.  I love people, and care so much I would do the world.  This worries me since I question my co-dependency and  caring.  Moving around a lot, I have made many friends.  My memories with them now exist in photographs and scattered stories.  Its always been easier for me to move on.  I rarely keep in touch, I just move away on good terms.  I still care about the people whose lives did a momentary planetary collide with mine.  I just don’t keep in touch, and then with guilt and shame, I lock them away in my heart.  I do have friends from elementary school and high school.  These women serve somewhat as my dysfunctional family since my real family was never there.  I’m connected to these souls in a strange and eternal way.  But the others I care for and come across, though I feel intensely, I leave them eventually.  Maybe I’m just a horrible person, maybe I have a problem with trust.     Sex  Why is it so easy to separate sex and love?  Its funny that I feel as if I don’t need love, but then I do need sex.  Sex is animal like and primal.  It could be an abuse issue, perhaps I’m able to leave my body during sex and detach.  This may be what makes me so wild.  This also may be a survival mechanism stemming from past abuse.      Dive Bars  Why does Jimmy Buffet, Steve Miller and Blue Oyster Cult serve as staple songs for every jukebox?  No matter what dive bar I go to, the same songs always play.  This is a constant that defies any geographic.  Sometimes you will hear Sublime, Black Sabbath, Bruce, Pat, Charlie Daniels Band or Steppenwolf.  But its always the same friggin songs!  What is up with that?   ADD  Discovering you have ADD as an adult is difficult.  You knew there was something different about you growing up.  Disorganized, sloppy handwriting, always in a rush, your mind races so fast.  You can never sit still or hold attention for long.  You talk really, really fast and say things without thinking.  You’re impulsive as hell.  A psychologist told me there are drugs to treat this.  My mother and sisters say that they would have put me on drugs as a kid, if that was the fashion in the 70s.  Thank god it wasn’t.  Let me pick the drugs I want to take please, thank you.    Dyslexia  All the geniuses of the world have been dyslexic.  From Einstein to Da Vinci.  Its embarrassing when you cant spell simple words like shark and you mispronounce things over and over with constant correction.  Your mind just does not see things the same way.  You mix things up and read things differently.  Why I didn’t get diagnosed as a kid defies belief.  Why didnt they notice?  Having an older sister with a diagnosis in same school system, and all the classic signs.  Maybe because my mother protested the school system so severely with my older sister’s diagnosis, they didn’t want to tackle that again.  I wish I would have known then, it would have explained a lot of things.  The only B I have ever received at Berkeley was due to grammatical errors.  The TA told me your content is amazing, but your grammatical errors can not be overlooked.  I edited those pieces over and over, till I cried sometimes.  I just could not see the errors, my mind does not work that way.  I wish I would have been diagnosed then, and had been able to have the protection of the Disabled Students Center.  But then, would I have still graduated UC Berkeley class of 1996 with highest distinction if I had such a public excuse?     Depression  Living is darkness has been the way of my life.  I have always been depressed, there has never been a year of my life without it.  It comes and goes yes, but it is almost as predictable as clockwork.  Sometimes I will be feeling great and all of a sudden I have this premonition of an oncoming depression.  I don’t want to happen, I just KNOW its coming.  It always does.  Especially seasonally, holidays and birthdays.  I hope to overcome my battle with depression.  Then I wonder if it is genetic.  This considering the high number of suicides on both sides of my family.    On Being PunkRock/Goth  I always say I will give up being punk rock when I have money.  Well I’m still waiting for the money, and now being punk is getting old.  I’m getting old, and I don’t want to be a burned out punker when I’m in my 40’s.  I don’t like labels, I never have.  When I say punk rock its more an attitude then label.  Its about being pissed off at the government, at capitalist bullshit, and at the popular culture media.  Its about being broke and struggle, its about wanting an alternative world.  When people see me, they always call me “Goth”.  I guess that is more of the look I have.  Even dressed up in a business power suit, or all dolled up for some 80’s style wedding dress, this look does not escape me.  No matter how hard I try to look “straight”.  I guess that is why I tattooed my hand.  I have Darth Vader’s tie fighter on the top of my hand between my thumb and my pointer finger.  In the same spot gang members tattoo their gangs signs.  Fuck it, let people judge me for my tie fighter, let them question whether I am in some gang, some ex prostitute, or jailbird.  Society should not judge for how someone looks.  You should always look beneath the onion peel.   just a reflection just a glimpse just a little reminder of all the what abouts and all the might have could have beens another day some other way but not another reason to continue and now you're one of us the wretched  the hopes and prays the better days the far aways forget it  it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to, did it  now you know this is what it feels like now you know this is what it feels like  the clouds will part and the sky cracks open and god himself will reach his fucking arm through just to push you down just to hold you down stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss and it's hard to believe it could come down to thisback at the beginning sinking spinning  and in the end we still pretend the time we spend not knowing when you're finally free and you could be  but it didn't turn out the way you wanted it to it didn't turn out quite the way that you wanted it  now you know this is what it feels like now you know this is what it feels like  you can try to stop it but it keeps on coming you can try to stop it but   I don't want you and I don't need you don't bother to resist I'll beat you It's not your fault that you're always wrong the weak ones are there to justify the strong the beautiful people the beautiful people it's all relative to the size of your steeple you can't see the forest for the trees you can't smell your own shit on your knees Hey you what do you see? something beautiful something free? hey you, are you trying to be mean? if you live with apes man, it's hard to be clean there's no time to discriminate, hate every motherfucker that's in your way the worms will live in every host it's hard to pick which one they eat most the horrible people, the horrible people it's as anatomic as the size of your steeple capitalism has made it this way, old-fashioned fascism will take it away     And that’s all she wrote.   -well that last part wasnt me, that was lyrics from NIN and MM.    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink

          Lets Not Forget  With the political election, Hollywood drizzle, summertime blues, and other news filling our minds, lets not forget our troops.  Yes, for me it’s very personal because my brother is a Captain in the Army and just returned home from Iraq.  However, with his return, others went to take his place and when (and if) they return….. my brother will go back. The war may be “officially” over, but we still have troops there.  Our troops will probably be there for years to come.  We can never forget them, and the sacrifice they are making.      Voluntary Service  When I was ranting about my brother going back to Iraq the other day, our favorite blogger,  urlLink Todd Vodka  brought up a good point.  In his Sideshow Bob like style he reminded me that my brother voluntarily enlisted.  This is very true.  These heroes voluntarily enlist to protect us, to put themselves in harms way, to potentially die for us, and fight for our freedom.  For this I thank them, I pray for them, I love them, and I think about them daily.     Government Property  I was a navy wife for four years.  It’s hard when you are married to and have a family with “government property”.  The military comes first….. always.  The family comes second, that is how it is.  This was always hard for me to deal with and accept, and truthfully, I never accustomed myself to that fact.  During my navy wife days, the first Persian Gulf War was going on, and my husband, a navy Seabee, was called up to go.  Our son had serious health problems at the time, and thanks to letters from doctors and pastors, he was able to get out of it.  Instead he stayed home and worked 24 hours shifts driving military men to airplanes headed for war.  I never saw him, he was never home.  Looking back now, I can laugh and say that was a good thing because we didn’t get along.  But truthfully, it was very, very hard.  I was a young mother, I didn’t know anyone, and my husband was never home.  I can only imagine how hard it is for families whose husbands/wives actually do go to Iraq.  My heart goes out to you all.      American Soldier  Yesterday I was contacted by a blogger known as  urlLink American Soldier . Actually, I had found his blog and posted some support and a hug.  After reading his comments and visiting my blog, he contacted me.  American Soldier is a married father who is about to be deployed to Iraq.  He will probably miss Christmas this year with his family, as well as other important and monumental events.  His blog will be not only a way for him to vent, but also a major communication line for his friends, family and supporters.  Due to the comments section on his blog, it is also a way for us to support him.   Soldier Blogs  In my quest to support our troops I have came across several soldier blogs.  My side bar has links to many of them.  Some of these soldiers are currently in Iraq or Afghanistan and some are here in the US but away from their families.  Their blogs serve as a real news source, a reality TV like glimpse at what life is like for our troops.  These blogs are also way to show support and love for their sacrifice and commitment to US.  I encourage you all to visit and support these military blogs.  Drop them a line of thanks too.     Luv to Jack  Another blogger hero is our beloved jack and his blog  urlLink Texas Music  (pronounced Texass by me lol).  As a reservist he also voluntarily enlisted to serve and protect us.  Thanks jack for all that you do, we love you.  Thank you for being my friend, and helping me too. xxxooooo   Thank You All  I thank and send love to all of our troops and their families.  You are all oh so LOVED!   Some special shoutout to my homey military blogers  -I didn’t want to play favorites, because all military bloggers need love and support, but I had to do a special shout out to some special bloggers.     urlLink Navy Doc Marc    My pacific northwest sweetie in Bethesda.  You’re a great guy, thanks for making our area proud.     urlLink CB    My cool cat Bay Area punk rocker currently in Iraq and jamming to the Smiths.  I think your writing is Amazing.  You should definitely compile a book.     urlLink Sean Doc in the Box    Im glad your coming home.  You have been an amazing reference for soldiers, families and supporters.  Your photoblog is heartbreaking and beautiful, your  urlLink blog  is informative and well written.  Your awesome, and I cant wait for the video.  Thank you.   urlLink  Wendy   I thank you for your support.  I think of your son in Iraq and send him love and positive energy.  Same to you and your husband.    urlLink Sgt. Hook   You are my hero!   urlLink  Jason    I hope you keep writing.  You are loved.   urlLink  Doc’s Grrrl Psycho Alice  Blessed Be! Beautiful goddess.  Your man is almost home.  Your support to him has been an inspiration.   urlLink  91Ghost    Your writing rocks!   urlLink  Jenny Just an Army Wife    Love to you, your family, and your husband.    urlLink David   You are an amazing person.  You are so loved.             urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink          urlLink

       That's what I like about these high school girls, I keep getting older, and they stay the same age.   - Wooderson from Dazed and Confused    MMMMM Candy!  What is it about younger men that makes them safe, tempting, and oh so yummy? Since my late 20’s, it seems most of they guys I have gone out with have been young, real young, at least 7 years younger.  The youngest guy I dated was 19 when I was 31, and that was a fun, fun time.  Talk about an ego boost, and the relationship was so safe because I had full control. ***evil maniacal laugh****   Young Boys, charming and innocent Adolescent fun My toys, spectral virginity I wanna watch them come Hey boys, I'm a candybar A tidbit for your tongue Those boys with your chastity I wanna be your very first one  Young boys, dressed up in leatherettes I wanna make 'em shine Come down to my special route Number sixty-nine My boy, shock me and thrill me You know what I desire You're hot, nasty and spicy You'll have to quench my fire  Chorus : Young boys, I want you to be my toys I'm begging you please Young boys, I'm down on my knees Young boys, I'll take you to heaven Boys  Young boys, soft and so kissable I'm waiting for their touch They're rough, that's why I like them I wanna taste their fudge Horny boys, youthful and healthy Lovegun never stops They come, it's unbelievable Squeeze you till you drop  Young boys, part of a family It's me that you can trust Right now, give me physically A boy to dim my lust Their dads don't like it They wan't me to themselves Sweet boys, tasty and horny I'll peel away their shell  - Lords of Acid Lyrics    Oh Mary Kay!   With the recent release of  urlLink Mary Kay Letourneau , things have got me thinking.  I mean, I definitely like them to be over 18.  I do admit, the older my son gets, the better looking his friends’ get.  Once they hit puberty, I stopped wearing skimpy outfits in front of them, or being huggy/flirty with them.  They are funny how they watch me with side ways glances, and make little comments.  They get especially crazy at sporting events or when they are in packs.  With flirty/shy smiles they always come up to me for big hugs, and hover around like fans.  It feels nice to be appreciated.  Some of them make bold comments like “call me sexual chocolate”.  This always cracks me up.  Puberty obviously does strange things to young minds, but like I said, they need to be over 18 to spark my interest.    Milf "Mother I'd Like (to) Fuck"   mothers, whether married, separated or divorced, that a male individual sees as physical attractive enough to want to have sexual intercourse with them. Just cuz their moms doesn't mean that they don't need a spark in their love life. If they've ever breastfed,they have really responsive nipples and a core of erectile tissue in their breasts. The ones in good shape have worked at regaining control over their vaginas (Kegel exercises).MILFs are usually real careful about birth control, they know accidents happen but they take responsible steps. They want to fuck with abandon, with no romantic complications for their under-19 family.  A MILF is any mother that is sexually desirable   -from UrbanDictionary. Com    A Fetish?  Young hard bodies, inexperienced minds….. mmmmmmmmmmm.  This is very, very tempting.  A dish best served hot, green, and fresh.  Is it just me here, or do others have this fetish?   We'd like to know A little bit about you For our files. We'd like to help you learn To help yourself. Look around you. All you see Are sympathetic eyes.

       Mother, mother  There's to many of you crying Brother, brother, brother There's far too many of you dying You know we've got to find a way To bring some lovin' here today - Yah  Father, father We don't need to escalate You see, war is not the answer For only love can conquer hate You know we've got to find a way To bring some lovin' here today  Picket lines and picket signs Don't punish me with brutality Talk to me So you can see Oh, what's going on What's going Ya, what's going on Ah, what's going on  (Background music and conversation) In the mean time Right on, baby Right on  Right on  Father, father, everybody thinks we're wrong Oh, but who are they to judge us Simply because our hair is long Oh, you know we've got to find a way To bring some understanding here today Oh  Picket lines and picket signs Don't punish me with brutality Talk to me,  So you can see Oh, what's going on What's going on I’ll tell you Ya, what's going on - Uh Ah, what's going on Right on baby Right on baby  - Whats going on by Marvin Gaye   Yeah so vader just found out that my brother is going back to Iraq.  I’m not too happy about it, in fact, I’m pretty pissed off.     My brother is 2 and ½ years younger than me.  He is the only boy, and I am the third female.  Of course, I was jealous of him, I was still a baby when he was born.  But I love him like I love no other man.  My brother is a Scorpio to my Pisces, and he has put up with more shit from me than any other.  Growing up, we fought like cats and dogs.  Spitting on each other, tackling each other, fighting like animals till the cows came home.  My elder siblings always told him, “one day you will be able to take her”.  I used to grab him by his ears and kick his ass down the hall.  Then, when he was able to kick my ass, it wasn’t fun anymore.  My brother is too much of a gentleman to ever really hurt a woman.  He always let me win, even when he could have taken me.    This fucking so called war really sucks.  I met a woman at a redneck bbq this weekend whose husband joined the reserves for extra cash.  Well, they called him up in January, and now he is in Iraq for the next year or so.  He is missing his kids’ birthdays, and his son’s first day of school.  Now she is a single momma, and that just sucks!  One of my GI boytoys is about to go to Iraq.  He has been in Iraq training school for the last couple of weeks.  He comes back this weekend and wants to get together.  I have never met him, just talked to him online.  I’m not too worried about meeting him, because my brother outranks him, and I could have his ass if he really messes with me.  Part of me wants to see him off, and blow his fucking mind…. The other part is just so sad that these young men have to go.   I don’t want to lose my brother.  I love him sooooooo much.   I hate the thought of him going back.  When he is in Iraq, I become obsessed with the news.  Every time I hear of a blackhawk going down I cry, I panic, and I pray.  It’s a hard way to live.  It’s a sacrifice I’m not willing to give for this shit.  God  Damnit George W, my fucking brother is worth more than your stupid ass oil war.  He is the world to me…. Please don’t make him go.  Im drunk and depressed.  I hate war.  Why can’t we all just get a bong?  Lol.  This sucks…..    urlLink Blogarama   Visit my Guestbook    urlLink
