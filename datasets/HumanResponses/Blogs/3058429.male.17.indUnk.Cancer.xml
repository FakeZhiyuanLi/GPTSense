      tennis has always been an integral part of my life ever since i took it up in pri 4.aft constant practises i think i can safely say tt i can play it qt well. during this period i've participated in numerous tourneys.n everytime i lost in any stage, i'd always reflect n try 2 get betta.i certain;y did hopefully..lol  one of my biggest regret was not able 2 win any stuff in e 4 yrs in tchs.despite losin 4times in as many yrs.n itz not an easy feat.perhaps most of my team mates screwed up n wasted my efforts. (sound damn arrogant rite? lol) sometimes, one really needs tt small bit of arrogance 2 succeed.haha  anw now m in nj.we haf a weak team when really compared 2 e big guns like ac n rj as well as vj.altho we were able 2 get 3rd last yr.this yr'd be a success 2 achieve e same result. e team may've suffered morale setbacks at this pt of time but we or perhaps i,personally, m determined 2 set e record straight.i'll try my best 2 win..  rite now i m really tryin 2 find some motivation frm within myself 2 play.i've done so all my life except e 1st 3 mths sad 2 admit.but i will put tt rite..i've been there, done tt....n y not again............

      dere r many stuffs i'll neva haf e courage 2 say it out or even type it out more den 1s... 4 yrs in tchs neva deter me frm tryin 2 socialise wif gals.durin tt period i've learnt alot frm dem but neva did i learn so much in this 3 mths..  it was completely a diff story in tchs as i dun c gals everyday in skl n hafin a gf doesnt affect my life as much.i usually spend time kicking soccer in skl n only go out mayb 1s a wk.so even parting in sec skl would mean little sadness compared 2 those in jcs or in mixed sec skls.altho i still feel sth as this shows i m serious abt wadeva i do in life...i made many mistakes in e past, more den enuff 2 be tolerated by ppl.n i m determined 2 put it rite n start on a fresh piece of paper in nj.....  sadly i think i made mistakes again.new 1s tho...but its terrible enuff..dere basically 2, one is 2 negelct e frenship stage n 2, i spoke 2 much...i can really lead a much betta life without those blunders.but as i say, i learn frm it...  graduating frm tchs means a complete new start 4 me as i stepped into nj confidently hoping 2 cont my gd run of academic results n oso try 2 break my medal drought in national skls tennis comp.but ironically 4 me, b4 either can or is achieved, otha things crept into my life..  this was e 1st time since pri skl tt i've got gal classmates.n i dun fancy my self havin a crush in such a premature stage.i was wrong..very wrong..so i met a gal.some strange feeling immediately ran into me.i began 2 try 2 tok 2 her. (i was very silent durin e early days our orientation)our conv din go 2 badly.so i was able 2 get her no. n stuff.besides, i oso found out tt we had some things in common...at 1st i neva tot tt i would like her alot.but sad 2 say, i did.  so as days pass by, my feelin grew.i neva knew whether i was living a dream or was i in reality.i neva intend 2 find out even till this very moment.e 1st mth went by n i could not help but look at her everyday skl during lessons.2 deny tt it neva affect my life n results, i m bullshittin.but wadeva it is, its all part of learning.n i accept tt.e 1st 2 mths was basically a struggle 4 me 2 keep up wif my skl stuffs n oso wif gettin into trouble wif e many teachers.y? i often ask myself, but i neva wana give an ans.theres no need 4 one anw.  durin e 1st part of e 3 mths, she seemed 2 haf ignored me..mayb cuz my att sux.in fact it really do.but her actions of ignorin me neva deter me frm feelin e same way as i did.altho whenever in skl she tok 2 otha ppl except me n always lookin thru me as if i wasnt there, i feel sad but i was able 2 stay composed..  somehow or ratha, things changed 2 betta in e 2nd half.she say my att improved but i doubt so.anw we became qt gd frens n tok qt alot much more den b4.i finally feel sth 2 look 4ward 2 in skl.i neva did my whole life...mayb i wanted more den frens which is extremely impatient n rash,i feel real fine wif e situation at e mom.   soon, o level results came out.i got 10.i was convinced i m able 2 stay in nj or perhaps go vj..while she gt 12.shes tryin 2 appeal back into nj.  durin e few days btwn o level results n jae, i was struggling within myself whether 2 go n stay.my initial intention was e former.somehow n 4 some strange reason i chose e latter.i might live 2 regret this.but as i say life stil haf 2 go on.  b4 e postin results cum out, i had a tennis tourney.she,my partner n a teacher came 2 watch.i was ratha motivated.i went into e semis b4 losin..ironically i was watched by no one durin tt match..my determination was not as much as b4...is she really such a big motivation? i duno..but results neva lie...  n when e jae posting n appeal results r settled, it ended me stayin in nj only.no one could haf predicted this.i feel sad of cuz..but except frm tt i can do nth..itz my fault in sum ways...or perhaps itz all mine...i dun wish 2 elaborate but yeah..  so now she mayb goin 2 poly..if tts fate i've nth 2 say..but i'm really goin thru a rough patch.a very low 1.but i haf been thru tuffer crisis n will recover even stronger.tennis is sth which i always manage 2 excel but even now i dun feel like doin so n quittin itz on e cards i m afraid...i will feel sad cuz itz been 6yrs since i took it up thru coincidence...  many may say i m immature but well i cant really differentiate immaturity frm doin wad i think itz write.but makin bad decisions is still mich betta den neva makin 1...  i dun c much hope in future but if on e day i m stil alive ,e flickerin light of hope will neva extinguish....cuz, i hate this word but i believe in it still..n it is FATE...
