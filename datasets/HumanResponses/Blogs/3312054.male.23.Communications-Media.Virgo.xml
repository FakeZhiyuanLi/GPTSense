      WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney's office denied Sunday that he was involved in a coordinated effort to secure a multibillion dollar Iraq oil deal for Halliburton, his former employer.  A reference to such an arrangement was made in an internal Pentagon e-mail from an Army Corps of Engineers official to another Pentagon employee, Time magazine reports in its June 7 edition, which is due on newsstands Monday.  The existence of the e-mail was confirmed to CNN by a senior administration official familiar with it.  The e-mail -- dated March 5, 2003 -- says Douglas Feith, undersecretary of defense for policy, approved the arrangement to award the contract to the oil-services company, the administration official said.  According to an e-mail excerpt in Time, the contract was "contingent on informing WH [White House] tomorrow. We anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w[ith] VP's office."  The Corps of Engineers gave Halliburton the contract three days later without seeking other bids, Time reports.  Time says it found the e-mail "among documents provided by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group."  The senior official told CNN the e-mail was a typical "heads-up" memo from one government agency to another that "a decision has been made, we're about to announce this contract, and as a courtesy we are alerting the White House of a public announcement. This is a standard practice."  The "coordinated action" referred to, the senior administration official said, was "that of publicly announcing the contract decision that has already been made."  The heads-up would have been given because of Cheney's previous involvement in the company as chief executive officer, and the anticipated controversy over the noncompetitive bid, the official said.  "The vice president and his office have played no role whatsoever in government contracting since he left private business to campaign for vice president" in 1999, Cheney spokesman Kevin Kellems said Sunday.  Time reports the e-mail also says Feith got the "authority to execute RIO," or Restore Iraqi Oil, from his supervisor, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz.  The contract was one of several Halliburton and its subsidiaries were awarded by the government over the past year.  Cheney was chairman and chief executive officer of the Texas-based Halliburton Co., one of the world's largest service providers to the oil and gas industry, from 1995 to 2000, when he resigned to run for vice president.  Cheney still receives about $150,000 a year in deferred payments for work he performed as chairman. He also holds more than 433,000 stock options, according to a report last fall by the Congressional Research Office requested by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat. (Full story)  Cheney has insisted in the past that the deferred compensation was set up two years before he became a vice presidential candidate in 2000 and that he assigned all his stock options to a charitable trust just before being sworn in.

      Years fom now, when he sits around the fire with his grandkids, he can show it to them.  "Here's a little souvenir of that unjust war I started"  Besides, who ever said this was a personal vendetta anyway.....   Bush Keeps Saddam's Pistol as Souvenir Trophy Presented to President by Troops Who Found Ex-Dictator  By MATTHEW COOPER, TIME  (May 30) -- When Saddam Hussein was rousted from his spider hole in Dawr, a town near Tikrit, by U.S. soldiers last December, Iraq's fallen dictator was clutching a pistol. He is now in detention at an undisclosed location, being questioned by American authorities and awaiting charges for war atrocities and crimes against humanity. But what ever happened to the pistol?  The sidearm has made its way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Sources say that the military had the pistol mounted after the soldiers seized it from Saddam and that it was then presented to the president privately by some of the troops who played a key role in ferreting out the old tyrant.  Though it was widely reported at the time that the pistol was loaded when they grabbed Saddam, Bush has told visitors that the gun was empty—and that it is still empty and safe to touch. "He really liked showing it off," says a recent visitor to the White House who has seen the gun. "He was really proud of it."  The pistol's new place of residence is in the small study next to the Oval Office where Bush takes select visitors after pointing out better-known White House pieces like the busts of Winston Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower and a watercolor called "A Charge to Keep," which gets its name from a Methodist hymn.  The study — the one where Bill Clinton held some of his infamous trysts with White House intern Monica Lewinsky — has become a place where Bush keeps the memorabilia that hold special significance for him. Another of the room's mementos: a photograph of special-forces soldiers in Afghanistan praying after burying a piece of the World Trade Center there as a tribute to those who died in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

      Just thought this was interesting....  'N.Y. Times' criticized for quiet mea culpa  For the second time in a year, the nation's so-called paper of record, The New York Times, has admitted that the record was flawed.  But unlike the Jayson Blair scandal, in which the paper detailed how the reporter fabricated and plagiarized a string of stories, the note "from the editors" published in Wednesday's newspaper did not single out anyone at theTimes for blame. Instead, in an 1,100-word note, editors said it was "past time" the Times examined its reporting in the lead-up to the Iraq war.   The note called some reports about supposed stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction "flawed" because they relied too heavily on now-suspect sources with insufficient corroboration. A major source was Ahmad Chalabi, an Iraqi exile (and former favorite of the Bush administration) who, along with others, had an interest in seeing the United States topple Saddam Hussein.  The administration then used the reports to help bolster the case for war.  The note said editors "fully intend to continue aggressive reporting aimed at setting the record straight."   But, while some in the news industry praised the paper for coming clean, others said the note fell far short of full disclosure, that it was long overdue, and that its message was obtuse at best.  "The Times' exercise would leave any less-than-knowledgeable reader wondering what the hell they were talking about," says former Newsweek chief Osborn Elliot.   Others blasted the paper for not singling out and sanctioning Times reporter Judith Miller, whose reports — which often used unnamed sources, frequently Chalabi — have been widely challenged.  "Unlike Blair's deceptions, Miller's lies provided the pretext for war. Her lies cost lives. If only the Times had done the same kind of investigation of Miller's reports as it had with Blair," says Amy Goodman, author of The Exception to the Rulers, which takes Miller to task for her stories. "It's outrageous to have a simple editor's note buried on page A10, while their repetition of the administrations' lies was consistently given top billing on the front pages of the paper."  Miller could not be reached. Times' public editor Daniel Okrent says he plans to write about the note in his Sunday column, but would not discuss its content.  The reporting in question occurred under former executive editor Howell Raines, who lost his job after the Blair scandal. In a note posted on Jim Romenesko's media Web site Wednesday, Raines said he disagreed with the contention "that problems in the WMD stories came about because some editors felt pressured to get scoops into the paper before the necessary checking had taken place."  Raines' replacement at the Times, Bill Keller, could not be reached. In a staff memo, he said the editor's note was "not an attempt to find a scapegoat or to blame reporters for not knowing then what we know now. ... (It) will not satisfy our most vociferous critics, but it is not written for them. It is an attempt to set the record straight, something we do as a point of journalistic pride."  Harvard media analyst Alex Jones, a former Times reporter, said that because of the Times' place in American journalism — many media outlets follow its lead — "when it gets something wrong, it is obliged to do a self-examination and tell the people who read it what went wrong and why. I don't think the Times has done that," and in the short-term, at least, may have harmed its credibility.  Others noted that misinformation flowed before, during and after the war, and that blame can't be laid solely at the Times' doorstep. But "there's no question that when the Times reports something on the front page, without skepticism, it carries weight," Jones says.  The Times' reports on WMD did just that for policy makers and media alike, says David Paletz, a Duke University political science professor. "The Times has a reputation for being skeptical and critical of those in power. Its reports may explain in part Democrats' docility in the run-up to the war. If the Times had been publishing more skeptical stories, some Democrats could have been emboldened to challenge the run-up."  George Stephanopoulos, host of ABC's This Week, said the note "was the brave and right thing to do. Everyone has been wondering how we got it so wrong, not just the media but also intelligence agencies, the Bush administration, Congress, even the U.N."  Martin Kaplan, dean of the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication, says that "for people who are serious and thoughtful, the Times is a gatekeeper of quality in terms of what's credible and believable. When it published those pieces, it sent signals which legitimized our going to war and calmed people's fears that we were rushing. It turns out that the Times was hoodwinked just like the rest of the country."  Perhaps, but for anyone to suggest that the Times reports led us to war is "absurd," says Stephanopoulos. The former Clinton administration communications chief says the newspaper's influence is sometimes exaggerated. "In this Internet age, there is so much information. ... No single newspaper has that much power or influence. People aren't waiting for a single newspaper to hit their doorstep at 6 a.m. to set the agenda."

      Well, I thought I'd start adding my input to this deal....   History lesson: GOP must stop Bush By Carl Bernstein Thirty years ago, a Republican president, facing impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate, was forced to resign because of unprecedented crimes he and his aides committed against the Constitution and people of the United States. Ultimately, Richard Nixon left office voluntarily because courageous leaders of the Republican Party put principle above party and acted with heroism in defense of the Constitution and rule of law. "What did the president know and when did he know it?" a Republican senator — Howard Baker of Tennessee — famously asked of Nixon 30 springtimes ago.  Today, confronted by the graphic horrors of Abu Ghraib prison, by ginned-up intelligence to justify war, by 652 American deaths since presidential operatives declared "Mission Accomplished," Republican leaders have yet to suggest that George W. Bush be held responsible for the disaster in Iraq and that perhaps he, not just Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, is ill-suited for his job.  Having read the report of Major Gen. Antonio Taguba, I expect Baker's question will resound again in another congressional investigation. The equally relevant question is whether Republicans will, Pavlov-like, continue to defend their president with ideological and partisan reflex, or remember the example of principled predecessors who pursued truth at another dark moment.  Today, the issue may not be high crimes and misdemeanors, but rather Bush's failure, or inability, to lead competently and honestly.  "You are courageously leading our nation in the war against terror," Bush told Rumsfeld in a Wizard-of-Oz moment May 10, as Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell and senior generals looked on. "You are a strong secretary of Defense, and our nation owes you a debt of gratitude." The scene recalled another Oz moment: Nixon praising his enablers, Bob Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, as "two of the finest public servants I've ever known."  Sidestepping the Constitution  Like Nixon, this president decided the Constitution could be bent on his watch. Terrorism justified it, and Rumsfeld's Pentagon promoted policies making inevitable what happened at Abu Ghraib — and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The legal justification for ignoring the Geneva Conventions regarding humane treatment of prisoners was enunciated in a memo to Bush, dated Jan. 25, 2002, from the White House counsel.  "As you have said, the war against terrorism is a new kind of war," Alberto Gonzales wrote Bush. "In my judgment, this new paradigm renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions." Quaint.  Since January, Bush and Rumsfeld have been aware of credible complaints of systematic torture. In March, Taguba's report reached Rumsfeld. Yet neither Bush nor his Defense secretary expressed concern publicly or leveled with Congress until photographic evidence of an American Gulag, possessed for months by the administration, was broadcast to the world.  Rumsfeld then explained, "You read it, as I say, it's one thing. You see these photographs and it's just unbelievable. ... It wasn't three-dimensional. It wasn't video. It wasn't color. It was quite a different thing." But the report also described atrocities never photographed or taped that were, often, even worse than the pictures — just as Nixon's actions were frequently far worse than his tapes recorded.  It was Barry Goldwater, the revered conservative, who convinced Nixon that he must resign or face certain conviction by the Senate — and perhaps jail. Goldwater delivered his message in person, at the White House, accompanied by Republican congressional leaders.  Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee likewise put principle above party to cast votes for articles of impeachment. On the eve of his mission, Goldwater told his wife that it might cost him his Senate seat on Election Day. Instead, the courage of Republicans willing to dissociate their party from Nixon helped Ronald Reagan win the presidency six years later, unencumbered by Watergate.  Another precedent is apt: In 1968, a few Democratic senators — J. William Fulbright, Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern and Robert F. Kennedy — challenged their party's torpor and insisted that President Lyndon Johnson be held accountable for his disastrous and disingenuous conduct of the Vietnam War, adding weight to public pressure, which, eventually, forced Johnson not to seek re-election.  Today, the United States is confronted by another ill-considered war, conceived in ideological zeal and pursued with contempt for truth, disregard of history and an arrogant assertion of American power that has stunned and alienated much of the world, including traditional allies. At a juncture in history when the United States needed a president to intelligently and forcefully lead a real international campaign against terrorism and its causes, Bush decided instead to unilaterally declare war on a totalitarian state that never represented a terrorist threat; to claim exemption from international law regarding the treatment of prisoners; to suspend constitutional guarantees even to non-combatants at home and abroad; and to ignore sound military advice from the only member of his Cabinet — Powell — with the most requisite experience. Instead of using America's moral authority to lead a great global cause, Bush squandered it.  In Republican cloakrooms, as in the Oval Office, response to catastrophe these days is more concerned with politics and PR than principle. Said Tom DeLay, House majority leader: "A full-fledged congressional investigation — that's like saying we need an investigation every time there's police brutality on the street."  When politics topples principles  To curtail any hint of dissension in the ranks, Bush scheduled a "pep rally" with congressional Republicans — speaking 35 minutes, after which, characteristically, he took no questions and lawmakers dutifully circled the wagons.  What did George W. Bush know and when did he know it? Another wartime president, Harry Truman, observed that the buck stops at the president's desk, not the Pentagon.  But among Republicans today, there seems to be scant interest in asking tough questions — or honoring the example of courageous leaders of Congress who, not long ago, stepped forward, setting principle before party, to hold accountable presidents who put their country in peril.  Carl Bernstein's most recent book is a biography of John Paul II, His Holiness. He is co-author, with Bob Woodward, of All the President's Men and The Final Days.

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. forces in Iraq will remain under U.S. command and will "do what is necessary to protect themselves" even if Iraqi authorities object, Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Tuesday.  Powell's comments, while narrowly focused, appeared to contradict British Prime Minister Tony Blair's statement that the interim government due to run Iraq after June 30 will have "final political control" over foreign forces in Iraq.   The uncertainty over how much say, if any, Iraqis will have over the 138,000 U.S. forces in Iraq is to be discussed by the United States and the interim government when it is named, possibly in the next week.  Washington has said the interim government -- to be picked by U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi -- will have full sovereignty.  But officials have said U.S. forces must remain under U.S. command and they have said the new Iraqi government may have to "give back" some of its sovereignty to permit this.  Asked if the new government could veto a U.S. operation, Powell told a news conference with Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel: "Obviously, we would take into account whatever they might say at a political and military level."  "Ultimately, however, if it comes down to the United States armed forces protecting themselves or in some way accomplishing their mission in a way that might not be in total consonance with what the Iraqi interim government might want to do at a particular moment in time, U.S. forces remain under U.S. command and will do what is necessary to protect themselves," Powell said.  "This a subject of discussion between ourselves and the new Iraqi government and I think it can be worked out and that will happen in June," said a Bush administration official who briefed reporters by conference call from Baghdad.  "There's no reason to believe they won't reach an amicable agreement on this," he added, saying the issue would be one of the first for the new government to address with Washington.  Michel, whose government opposed the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein last year, said it would be difficult for Belgium to send troops to Iraq but suggested it would not oppose a NATO role.  While many NATO members have troops in Iraq, there does not appear to be consensus for the alliance to take on a broader role, with some nations saying it should focus on Afghanistan.

      Yet another classy move on the part of our military. I also love these military investigations that never seem to find anything wrong.  The Reuter News Agency, one of the world's oldest and most respected news organizations, unleashed a blistering attack on the leadership of U.S. military forces in Iraq Thursday, accusing it of putting into play procedures that led to the death of a Reuters TV cameramen in Iraq last year. Award-winning cameraman Mazen Dana was shot and killed by a U.S. soldier outside the notorious Abu Ghraib prison last Aug. 17 after his camera was reportedly mistaken for a grenade launcher. A military investigation later concluded that neither the soldier nor the military system was at fault in the incident. Reuters, however, charged that the shooting was the result of a system that "demonstrated significant flaws, including the way in which the military communicates, the way in which it trains its personnel and the rules and procedures that govern its conduct in the field." It was the second broadside launched by the news organization this week. On Monday Reuters disclosed that three of its journalists in Iraq, along with another from NBC, were subjected to physical and sexual abuse while being held by U.S. soldiers last January. It called the military investigation of the matter "woefully inadequate."

      This is getting out of hand.    House Approves $447 Billion in Spending for Military By CARL HULSE  Published: May 21, 2004   ASHINGTON, May 20 - The House on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a $447 billion military package that includes the extra $25 billion sought by the Bush administration to pay for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through early next year.  Authors of the measure, which passed by a bipartisan margin of 391 to 34, said it was specifically geared toward the needs of those fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, providing $1 billion for new vehicle armor, replenishing stockpiles of arms and ammunition and giving military personnel a pay raise and other benefits.   Advertisement     "This is the year of the troops," said Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and chairman of the Armed Services Committee.  The House defied a veto threat from the administration by keeping a two-year delay on a round of military base closings set for next year, easily defeating an effort to require the closings to move forward in 2005. Mr. Hunter and other senior Republicans said they did not expect the Pentagon's spending plan for the year beginning Oct. 1 to be rejected over the base closing provision.  Senators were moving much more slowly with their own $422 billion measure and abandoned hope of finishing before leaving on their Memorial Day break. Both the House and Senate were considering the proposals against the backdrop of the prison scandal in Iraq and continuing unrest and uncertainty there.  "We are in a war," said Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, the senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. "Neither the country nor this Congress was united in initiating the conflict, but we stand now as one with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines fighting it."  House Democrats complained throughout two days of debate that they were prevented from offering important amendments, but in the end most of them supported the legislation. Some Democrats said the $400 million for body armor and other "force protection" provisions showed that the troops dispatched to Iraq were ill-equipped in the first place. "There is no excuse for us to send our soldiers into harm's way without this most basic protection," said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York.  Among the personnel benefits in the measure are a 3.5 percent pay increase, a raise in hazardous duty and family separation pay, improved survivor benefits and elimination of a limit on the construction of military housing. The measure also allows for adding 30,000 troops in the Army over the next three years and 9,000 in the Marine Corps.  Democrats again failed to strip the measure of money for researching a new nuclear weapon capable of penetrating underground bunkers. But Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, Democrat of California, noted that the 214-to-204 vote was closer than a similar effort last year, which she read as a sign of growing skepticism about new nuclear devices. Opponents of the nuclear program say it could spur proliferation.  The most significant fight was over the plan to proceed next year with the base closings, an important matter for lawmakers trying to protect facilities in their districts. Opponents of delaying the base closings said that the military needed to get moving on shutting under-used facilities and that the economic impact on communities was exaggerated.  But supporters of the two-year delay said the makeup of the armed forces was undergoing significant changes given the conflict in Iraq and that it would be impractical to proceed next year before a study of overseas installations was finished.  "Too many balls are in the air," said Representative Joel Hefley, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the subcommittee on military readiness. Mr. Hefley prevailed, 259 to 162, against the push to keep the closings on track. That decision sets up an eventual showdown with the Senate, which this week narrowly defeated an effort to delay the closings.  The House also gave its support to tearing down the Abu Ghraib prison, the scene of the abuse of Iraq detainees, and replacing it with a new facility. But lawmakers defeated a Democratic push for a special Congressional inquiry into the abuse as Democrats complained that the House was failing in oversight of the war.  The debate in the Senate got off track this week when the Armed Services Committee spent much of Wednesday on its third hearing into the prison abuse cases. Lawmakers will take the bill up again in about 10 days. The Senate consideration promises to be more contentious than the House, though the outcome is likely to be the same, with a wide approval for the measure.  Both parties are near agreement on incorporating the $25 billion in war money in the Senate measure. But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, is trying to add a requirement that President Bush deliver a report on his strategy for stabilizing Iraq. Democrats also intend to challenge the spending on new nuclear weapons and money for missile defense while proposing a troop increase beyond that adopted by the House.

      I found this ineresting and not surprising...   SAVANNAH, Georgia (AP) -- A U.S. soldier who left his unit in Iraq rather than fight for what he called an "oil-driven war" faces a court-martial Wednesday on a desertion charge.  Staff Sgt. Camilo Mejia, 28, of Miami Beach, Florida, could go to prison for a year and receive a bad conduct discharge if convicted by a military jury at Fort Stewart.  The Florida National Guardsman left his unit in Iraq in October on a two-week furlough to the United States. He was gone for five months before turning himself in to the Army in March.  He said his war experience made him decide to seek conscientious objector status.  The infantryman said he believes the war is unjust because it is about control of oil supplies. He also said he was upset over the death of civilians.  He said he was particularly upset over an incident in which his unit was ambushed and civilians were hit in the ensuing gunfire, and another in which he said an Iraqi boy died after confusion over which military doctor should treat him.  He also claimed he saw Iraqi prisoners treated "with great cruelty" when he was put in charge of processing detainees a year ago at al-Assad, an Iraqi air base occupied by U.S. forces.  Mejia filed the statements March 16, before the Iraqi prisoner scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison became public. Fort Stewart officials said they have forwarded his account to the Army.  In his objector application, Mejia said detainees were kept blindfolded and troops were ordered to use sleep-deprivation tactics to aid with interrogations.  He said prisoners were kept awake for up to 48 hours at a time, often by yelling at them or having them sit and stand for several minutes.  "When these techniques failed, we would bang on the wall with a huge sledgehammer ... or load a 9 mm pistol next to their ear," Mejia wrote.  "The way we treated these men was hard even for the soldiers, especially after realizing that many of these `combatants' were no more than shepherds."

      This is from the India Times. I love how you can tell just by reading the first few sentences that it isn't from a US paper.     Cannes: Michael Moore's provocative documentary `Fahrenheit 9/11', which is a sock in the solar plexus, had a rousing reception at its world premiere at the Cannes film festival on Monday. It emphatically puts a bomb under the American President George Bush. So potent is the film that Michael Eisner, chief of Disney, the studio backing him, initially tried to block the US release of the film, saying he did not want to release such a political film in an election year. So Michael Moore and Miramax Films bosses Harvey and Bob Weinstein are negotiating to release it independently with third parties. ``The plan is to release it on the fourth of July in the US,'' said Moore, who is currently wallowing in glory at Cannes. The film exposes how US President George W Bush and his cronies are connected with companies that directly receive about $1.4 billion from rich and powerful Saudi Arabian families, including Osama Bin Laden. It reveals Bush's indirect complicity in allowing the attacks of September 11, 2001 to occur, despite advance information, as well as pussyfooting when it comes to taking action on the terrorists subsequently. It exposes his complicity with Osama Bin Laden himself and his relatives by allowing 42 Saudi royal families to leave the US on  Septermber 13, 2001, after the blasts.       Moreover, the film shows how  Hamid Karzai, whom the US helped install to  head the government in Afghanistan, is a former adviser of Unocal, a company with which Bush is closely connected. It also explains how Mr Bush systematically organized human fodder for the war in Iraq, and demonstrates how he and his buddies' companies directly benefit from this war.       The title of Moore's documentary is inspired by Francois Truffaut's 1966 film Fahrenheit 451, on a doomsday state where books are banned by a government that fears independent thinking. In addition to painstaking homework, Fahrenheit 9/11 uses archival footage with deft editing to make a devilishly satirical film that exposes George W. Bush. The film's satire left the Cannes audience laughing out loud at the stupidity and brazen manipulativeness of America. Our Anand Patwardhan would have loved it. He might consider leavening his own touch as in this film, because Moore's laughs sting like no other.   Moore, who lustily courts controversy, earlier made the hit documentary Bowling for Columbine, on the US devotion to the gun culture, which won an Oscar in 2003. His acceptance speech, in which he attacked President Bush and the Iraq war were memorable. "I think as a film-maker my first contribution would just be to make a good movie that people would love to see and leave the theatre charged, with a sense of excitement,'' Mr Moore said. ``You so rarely get it and I can't wait around for other people to give it to me." Moore's earlier films include `Roger and Me' and `Canadian Bacon', as w ell as the best-selling books Stupid White Men, which has sold over 3 million copies and `Dude, Where's My Country?', which topped the New York Times best-seller list. His Book Downsize This, which is a scathing attack on corporate America, has inspired his next documentary feature, The Big One.   It may be recalled that Sean Penn has similiarly made a film for `September 11', a portmanteau film made in 2002, with film contributions by directors worldwide. But it was brooding and ambiguous; there is no doubt that Moore's film will definitely create a wider impact. Meenakshi Shedde was on the International Critics' Jury of the Cannes film festival in 2001.

      This is part of an article from CNN.com  CANNES, France -- Michael Moore's controversial anti-Bush film "Fahrenheit 9/11" has debuted at the Cannes Film Festival to resounding applause from film critics.  Moore, who is facing an uphill battle to get his movie into U.S. theaters this summer as planned, offers a relentless critique of the Bush administration both before and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.  "You see so many movies after they've been hyped to heaven and they turn out to be complete crap, but this is a powerful film," Baz Bamigboye, a film columnist for London's Daily Mail newspaper, told The Associated Press.  "It would be a shame if Americans didn't get to see this movie about important stuff happening in their own backyard."  Even Moore's skeptics seemed impressed.  "I have a problematic relationship with some of Michael Moore's work. There's no such job as a standup journalist," said James Rocchi, film critic for DVD rental company Netflix.  But Rocchi said "Fahrenheit 9/11" contains powerful segments about losses on both sides of the Iraq war and the grief of American and Iraqi families.  "This film is at its best when it is most direct and speaks from the heart, when it shows lives torn apart," Rocchi told AP.  The film links Bush with powerful Saudi families, including that of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  It also includes pictures of Iraqi prisoners being abused, as well as grisly images of dead Iraqi babies and children burned by napalm along with maimed and injured U.S. soldiers.  The film takes its title from Ray Bradbury's novel "Fahrenheit 451," which refers to the temperature needed to burn books in an anti-Utopian society. Moore calls "Fahrenheit 9/11" the "temperature at which freedom burns."

      This is from The Guardian....some interesting comments. Thanks to Gene for the heads up on this.    While we have your attention, Mr President...   It's not often that we get the chance to speak directly to the most powerful man in the world. So as George Bush lands in Britain for his first state visit, we asked 60 Brits and Americans to make the most of it   Tuesday November 18, 2003 The Guardian    Dear President Bush,   I'm sure you'll be having a nice little tea party with your fellow war criminal, Tony Blair. Please wash the cucumber sandwiches down with a glass of blood, with my compliments.  Harold Pinter  Playwright     Dear Mr Bush,   Two years ago, shortly after the 9/11 atrocity I was arrested in the early hours of the morning at the home I shared with my wife in Colnbrook. At the time we were happy and looking forward to the future. I was studying to convert my US commercial pilot's licence to a European one and Sonia, my beautiful wife, had recently had a promotion at work. As the anti-terrorist branch officers stormed into our home, our life died and the nightmare began.   The front page headlines around the world reported the US and their representatives as saying that I was the "lead instructor" of four of the pilots responsible for the hijackings and that I would in time be charged for "conspiracy to murder". I faced extradition and the death penalty.   The proceedings against me lasted seven long months. Millions of pounds and dollars were spent on what the crown prosecution service described as the biggest investigation ever in the UK. The result was that the US case against me was thrown out of court by a UK judge who said that there had been "no evidence whatsoever" to support the allegation that I was involved in terrorism.   I spent five months of hell in Belmarsh prison where threats were made on my life. My dream of a career as a pilot is over. The money spent on my training is wasted. My wife and I are unemployed. Many people will now always think of me as a terrorist. Because the US won't admit they were wrong and withdraw the warrant I can't travel out of the UK except to visit Algeria. I can't even visit my in-laws in France. The "war on terror" has moved on but my life and family are still in pieces.  Lotfi Raissi  The pilot falsely accused of aiding the September 11 terrorists     Dear Jorge,   Look out! Behind you!!   Hahahahahahahaha, only kidding.   Love,  DBC Pierre  Novelist   Dear Mr Bush,   Novelists are famous for not knowing much about public affairs, but for what it is worth, I have always liked America. I have only been a tourist, but my family goes back a long way: my grandfather died as a reporter with American troops on the Rhine in 1945, and my father was wounded twice at Anzio fighting alongside the US Third Infantry Division.   After that, we had our Suez; you had your Vietnam, Korea, Guatemala, Chile... I could go on, but we will pass over these things because in the 20th century we won the first, second and cold wars. It wasn't just the winning, it was the fact that we were on the democratic side, and that we behaved with propriety. We were not the aggressors. We negotiated. You waited. Good heavens, did you ever wait!   Pearl Harbor and the Twin Towers were attacks to which you responded with appropriate force. Saddam Hussein, however, had neither the means nor the motive to attack you. Nor did he supply others. None of the reasons you offered for invading Iraq - taken singly or jointly - stood up to moral or strategic scrutiny. This was clear to even those of us well disposed towards America. We were at first puzzled ("I'm sure they know something we don't, they're just not allowed to tell us"); then, as it became apparent that you knew nothing, we became unhappy.   What we hated was the way you failed to understand the inheritance of the west. It was not a birthright of absolute superiority, but it was the best thing we had; it was something that went, as Mr Blair put it, to the "heart of our credibility as a nation". And this credibility, for which so many millions died - you have let it run through your hands. And in doing so, you allowed a British prime minister to be morally finessed by Jacques Chirac... Dear God, that it should come to that.   You can laugh at the old Stalinists who lead the protest march against you and ignore the anti-western ranting of a few journalists here whose pathology is one of guilt and self-hatred. But please do be aware of the distaste felt towards what you have done by reasonable, pro-American Britons. I hate to think what the allied dead of two world wars would have made of it, and of your presidency.  Sebastian Faulks  Novelist    Dear George,   I hate to wake you up from that dream you are having, the one in which you are a superhero bringing democracy and freedom to underdeveloped, oppressed countries. But you really need to check things out in one of the countries you have recently bombed to freedom. Georgie, I am kind of worried that things are going a bit bad in Iraq and you don't seem to care that much. You might want it to appear as if things are going well and sign Iraq off as a job well done, but I am afraid this is not the case.   Listen, habibi, it is not over yet. Let me explain this in simple terms. You have spilled a glass full of tomato juice on an already dirty carpet and now you have to clean up the whole room. Not all of the mess is your fault but you volunteered to clean it up. I bet if someone had explained it to you like that you would have been less hasty going on our Rambo-in-Baghdad trip.   To tell you the truth, I am glad that someone is doing the cleaning up, and thank you for getting rid of that scary guy with the hideous moustache that we had for president. But I have to say that the advertisements you were dropping from your B52s before the bombs fell promised a much more efficient and speedy service. We are a bit disappointed. So would you please, pretty please, with sugar on top, get your act together and stop telling people you have Iraq all figured out when you are giving us the trial-and-error approach?   Anyway, I hope this doesn't disturb you too much. Have a nice stay in London, wave hello to the demonstrators, and give my regards to your spin doctors. I bet they are having a hell of a job making you look good.  Regards,  Salam Pax  The Baghdad Blogger

       WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Colin Powell emphatically said yesterday that if the incoming Iraqi interim government ordered the departure of foreign troops after June 30, they would pack up without protest, but emphasized he doubted such a request would be made.   Powell said the United States believes a U.N. resolution passed last year and Iraqi administrative law provide necessary authority for coalition forces — currently numbering about 170,000 — to remain even beyond the scheduled June 30 handover of limited sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government.   "We're there to support the Iraqi people and protect them and the new government," Powell said at a news conference with other foreign ministers from the Group of Eight nations. "I have no doubt the new government will welcome our presence and am losing no sleep over whether they will ask us to stay."   But were the new government to say it could handle security, "then we would leave," Powell said.   Powell said he was "not ducking the hypothetical, which I usually do," to avoid confusion on the extent of the new government's authority.   His statement, which was echoed by L. Paul Bremer, the U.S. civilian administrator in Iraq, and the foreign ministers of Britain, Italy and Japan, came one day after conflicting testimony by administration officials on the issue.   Testifying before the House International Relations Committee on Thursday, Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman appeared to say the interim government could order the departure of foreign troops, only to be contradicted by Lt. Gen. Walter Sharp, Joint Chief of Staffs director for strategic plans and policy, who asserted that only an elected government could do so. Iraqi elections are scheduled for January.   The new government's ability to assert its authority after the occupation authority dissolves has been a central question in the international consultations over the shape of the incoming government, with the United States under pressure to transfer as much political power as possible to the Iraqi people.   "The Iraqi government has to be in a position to govern, and that's why I mean that it has to be a break with the past," French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier said. In Baghdad, Bremer told a delegation from Iraq's Diyala province that American forces would not stay where they were unwelcome.  "If the provisional government asks us to leave, we will leave," Bremer said, referring to an Iraqi administration due to take power June 30. "I don't think that will happen, but obviously we don't stay in countries where we're not welcome."   White House spokesman Scott McClellan told reporters the Iraqi people still want help from the United States and coalition forces to provide security.   "Iraqi security forces are not fully equipped and trained to provide for their own security and defend their country against terrorists," McClellan said. "And so, after the transfer of sovereignty on June 30, we expect to continue to partner with the Iraqi forces to improve the security situation."   French, Russian and Italian officials pressed yesterday for the new Iraqi government to be given the authority to halt military actions by U.S. forces.   Powell rejected that, saying the forces will remain under the command of an American who "has to be free to take whatever decisions he believes are appropriate to accomplish his mission."   But Foreign Minister Franco Frattini of Italy, a strong supporter of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, disagreed. "If we imagine a unilateral decision by coalition forces after June 30, without listening to the Iraqi people or without giving them the power to say no, there won't be a transfer of power," Frattini told reporters.   "And, in fact, what we want is that there is such power for the Iraqi people."  >>>>>>>>>>

      Another NY Times article....the tides are a' turning. Anyone have any ideas as to what G.Bush jr. will try to create as a distraction to this botched debacle of a war we should have never started? Invade Canada perhaps b/c the mounties have too much power?   New Polls Show Support for Bush Has Slipped to New Low By JANET ELDER  Published: May 14, 2004   Support for the Bush administration's policies in Iraq are at the lowest point since the war began, even as a majority of Americans say the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American military personnel is confined to a few isolated incidents and a few soldiers, according to polls out this week.  For the first time since the war began, a majority of the respondents to the Gallup poll — 54 percent — say the war in Iraq has not been worth the costs, while 44 percent said it has been worthwhile. When the war first began in March 2003, 29 percent of Americans said the war was not worth it, while 68 percent said it was.   Advertisement     Even so, the Pew Research Center poll found that 51 percent of Americans still say the United States made the right decision in using military force against Iraq in the first place; 42 percent said it was the wrong decision all along.  The polls made clear that Americans do not think the actions in the Iraqi prison by enlisted military personnel was accepted United States military policy for dealing with prisoners of war, but rather the acts of a small number of people who took it upon themselves to inflict pain and degradation.  In the Gallup poll, 8 in 10 respondents said they believed the actions of the soldiers violated United States military policy, while fewer than 2 in 10 said it was accepted policy. More than half, 56 percent of those polled, said the soldiers involved in the abusive acts were acting on their own rather than complying with orders. Thirty-four percent said the soldiers were following orders.  Similarly, two-thirds of the respondents to the Gallup poll said they believed the abuse of prisoners was isolated, while a third said it was a common occurrence. Americans said the actions were serious offenses that deserve criminal punishment. Seven in 10 in the Gallup poll said the actions of the soldiers in the photographed incidents were serious offenses while 2 in 10 said they were harmless pranks.  These findings were similar to those of an ABC News/Washington Post poll out last week. In that poll, 61 percent of the respondents said the abuse of Iraqi prisoners was confined to a few isolated incidents, while 31 percent said it was more widespread.  Mr. Bush's overall job approval rating is the lowest recorded by the Gallup poll since Mr. Bush took office, and among the lowest recorded by the Pew Research Center.  In the Gallup poll, a majority of Americans, 51 percent, now say they disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling his job as president; 46 percent approve. In the Pew poll, 48 percent of the respondents disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is doing his job, and 44 percent approve.  On the subject of Iraq, Americans are particularly critical. Fifty-eight percent now say they disapprove of the way Mr. Bush is handling the situation there, while 41 percent approve.  Looking ahead, Americans are reluctant to send any more troops to Iraq. Only 25 percent said the United States should send more troops, 24 percent said the number should be kept as it is now, while a plurality said the country should withdraw some (18 percent) or all (29 percent) of its troops from Iraq.  The nationwide telephone polls were taken before the images of the beheading of Nicholas E. Berg, an American civilian in Iraq, by Islamic terrorists were made public. The Gallup poll was taken May 7-9 with 1,003 adults, the Pew Research Center poll was taken May 3-9 with 1800 adults and the ABC News/Washington Post poll was taken May 5-6 with 802 adults.  The Gallup poll and the Pew poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, and the ABC News/Washington Post poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.>>>

      Just think of what else we could be using 50 billion dollars for...   US military cost in Iraq, Afghanistan to exceed $50 billion next year: official     www.chinaview.cn 2004-05-14 08:38:56         WASHINGTON, May 13 (Xinhuanet) -- US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan will cost over 50 billion US dollars next year, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Thursday.       The administration would make the next request for money to fund US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan early next year, which "will surely be much larger than 25 billion" dollars, Wolfowitz told senators at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.       The White House formally proposed a request last week for 25 billion dollars for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next financial year that begins on Oct. 1, because of the growing cost of US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.       White House budget chief Joshua Bolten said earlier this year that the military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan would probably be 50 billion dollars for the next year.       The war spending is not included in the 402 billion dollars theWhite House has proposed for the Defense Department for 2005. Enditem

             By Jon Hurdle  PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The father of Nick Berg, the American beheaded in Iraq, directly blamed President Bush and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on Thursday for his son's death.   "My son died for the sins of George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld. This administration did this," Berg said in an interview with radio station KYW-AM.   In the interview from outside his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania, a seething Michael Berg also said his 26-year-old son, a civilian contractor, probably would have felt positive, even about his executioners, until the last minute.   "I am sure that he only saw the good in his captors until the last second of his life," Berg said. "They did not know what they were doing. They killed their best friend."   Two days after the publication of a video showing the execution of his son by five masked men, Berg attacked the Bush administration for its invasion of Iraq and its sponsorship of the Patriot Act, which gives sweeping powers of surveillance to the federal government.   Berg described the Patriot Act as a "coup d'etat." He added: "It's not the same America I grew up in."   The criticism came amid finger-pointing between Berg's family, U.S. military officials and Iraqi police over the young businessman's imprisonment before his execution.   Michael Berg rejected U.S. government claims that his son had never been held by American authorities in Iraq. The Iraqi police chief in the city of Mosul has also contradicted statements by the U.S.-led coalition concerning the younger Berg's detention.   'FBI CAME TO MY HOUSE'   "I have a written statement from the State Department in Baghdad ... saying that my son was being held by the military," Berg said. "I can also assure you that the FBI came to my house on March 31 and told me that the FBI had him in Mosul in an Iraqi prison."   Dan Senor, spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority, said this week that Nick Berg was arrested in Mosul by Iraqi police on March 24 and released on April 6.  Senor said the FBI visited Berg three times during his detention by Iraqi police and determined that he was not involved in criminal or terrorist activities.  Brig.-Gen. Mark Kimmitt, the top U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, said American military police had seen Berg during his detention to make sure he was being fed and treated properly.   Berg returned to Baghdad from Mosul in April and went missing on April 9, during a chaotic period when dozens of foreigners were snatched by guerrillas west of the capital.   His body was discovered by a road near Baghdad on Saturday. The video of his decapitation was posted on the Internet on Tuesday.   Berg had been in Baghdad from late December to Feb. 1 and returned to Iraq in March. He did not find work and planned to return home at the end of March, according to his parents.   Berg's communications to his parents stopped on March 24 and he told them later he was jailed by Iraqi officials after being picked up at a checkpoint in Mosul.   On April 5, the Bergs filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, naming Rumsfeld and alleging their son was being held illegally by the U.S. military in Iraq. The next day, he was released.

      This is from The New York Times. You know something is wrong when the conservatives keep turning on ol' master Bush.     Bush Supporters Are Split on How to Pursue Iraq Plan By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON  Published: May 13, 2004   ASHINGTON, May 12 — President Bush said on Wednesday that the beheading of an American working in Iraq was part of an effort to "shake our confidence," but he insisted that the United States would "complete our mission," despite what his aides freely concede is a major loss of credibility in the Arab world.  Speaking briefly on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Bush appeared to try to use the beheading of Nicholas Berg, a young Pennsylvania man seeking work rebuilding Iraq, to refocus attention on the nature of the enemy the United States faces rather than on the continuing investigation into the abuses of Iraqi prisoners in American custody.  But some of Mr. Bush's aides and many of his outside advisers said in interviews that conservatives who had backed the war were now badly fractured on how the administration should pursue its Iraq strategy, and they fear that the combination of the prisoner abuse scandal and the inability of American forces to put down the insurgency are taking a toll on the Bush re-election race.  "You are seeing several camps develop," said William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard. "There are unapologetic hawks," a category he puts himself in; "we are critical of the president for failures of execution but still think it is winnable. There are loyalists, who stick to the Republican talking point that it is going well. There are supporters of the war who now have second thoughts, and there is a category of conservatives who are saying `be tough, but then get out.' "  Mr. Bush made it clear Wednesday that he had no intention of getting out, and said Mr. Berg's death was a reminder of why the United States is still fighting in Iraq. Those killers said in statements released with digital images of the beheading that they were acting in retaliation for the treatment of Iraqis at Abu Ghraib prison. But White House officials on Wednesday dismissed those comments as excuses offered by killers who are seeking justifications for executing Americans.  "Their intention is to shake our will, their intention is to shake our confidence," Mr. Bush said, declining to take any questions. "We will complete our mission. We will complete our task."  To back up their assertion that the administration has not been blown off course, officials went to some lengths on Wednesday to demonstrate that their effort to create a new, democratic government was proceeding according to plan.  One senior administration official, calling reporters from Baghdad, said that both the abuse of prisoners and the escalating violence had not set back plans to form a transitional government that would take power on June 30. He described in detail the makeup of that government — a president, two vice presidents, a prime minister and more than two dozen ministers — and said that if there was reluctance to move ahead with American and United Nations plans, "I don't encounter it in my discussions."  The optimistic line from the White House contrasted sharply with the assessment of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, who told a Senate panel on Wednesday that he expected an increase in violence between now and the handover of sovereignty.  "Between now and the 30th of June, we know it's going to get worse," General Myers said.  It was a measure of the troubles Mr. Bush is running into within his own party that Senator Pete V. Domenici, a New Mexico Republican who usually sides with the administration, expressed his frustration to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld on Wednesday that he could find no clear vision in the administration's Iraq strategy.  "I am very worried about how prepared the Iraqis are to take over this responsibility and, secondly, what we have done to prepare ourselves and them to work together to make this work," Mr. Domenici told Mr. Rumsfeld at a budget hearing. "I can envision that this situation will not work, and that we won't have an organizational structure that will do anything other than have Americans fighting and us supplying those fighters with more and more money."  The unease among conservatives has also been given voice in recent days by a number of influential commentators. George F. Will wrote in The Washington Post on Tuesday of a series of "failures" by the administration for which no one was held accountable, including post-war planning that was "botched." On Monday, the syndicated columnist Robert D. Novak wrote that there was a clear consensus among Republicans in Congress, Republican fund-raisers, contributors and others he had canvassed that Mr. Rumsfeld had to resign.  But The Wall Street Journal's editorial page on Wednesday appeared to better capture the mood of many Republicans in the House, especially after the images of the beheading became public. The Journal wrote that the American public was primarily focused on "the far larger question of American purpose" and said the real challenge for the White House is "not who wins in November but who wins in Iraq."  Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the Republican majority whip, said the televised images of the beheading had a palpable effect both on public opinion and the mood among lawmakers after days in which the focus had been on embarrassment and anger over prisoner abuse.  "If you had your thumb on the pulse of America, that pulse beat changed when Americans heard about the beheading of Nick Berg," Mr. Blunt said in an interview. "It jolted everybody's memory again about why we were there in Iraq and who we're dealing with."  But more moderate Republicans said the images of the prisoners being abused would continue to influence public opinion about the war. "We're in an enormous reconsideration cycle in this country," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican who opposed the invasion of Iraq.  Even as they denounced the beheading of Mr. Berg as barbaric, Democrats signaled that they would not stop criticizing the administration for its handling of Iraq.

      Good News!!! Lets hope this comes out in the summer!    Moore film gets distribution as Disney appeased May 13, 2004 - 8:38AM  Miramax Films co-chiefs Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein have reached a deal with The Walt Disney Co allowing them to find a new distributor for director Michael Moore's controversial documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which Disney refused to distribute.  "We are very happy that Disney has agreed to sell Fahrenheit 911 to Bob and Harvey," Miramax spokesman Matthew Hiltzik said in a statement.  Under the agreement, Harvey and Bob Weinstein would acquire the rights to the film that chronicles America's response to the September 11 attacks and looks at links between the family of President George W Bush and prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama bin Laden.

      Welcome everyone!!! Here is an article from The Daily Star.    Amnesty International urged the United Kingdom Tuesday to take action to secure the lives of Iraqi civilians, accusing British occupation forces in the war-torn country of killing non-combatants without justification, including an 8-year-old girl.  Meanwhile, a British court ruled that relatives of victims killed by UK troops in Iraq could bring their case against the government. British officials are under increasing domestic pressure over their policy in Iraq after the scandal of mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners erupted.  "The way things are going in Iraq it seems to me it is in everyone's interest that this point should be decided as soon as possible," said Judge Andrew Collins, who ruled the European Convention on Human Rights was applicable to the case of the 12 families of the victims.  Amnesty International appealed to UK authorities to ensure that all individuals exercising law enforcement functions in Iraq uphold civilians' right to life on the grounds of the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms, and principles of humanitarian law.  "In several cases documented by Amnesty International, UK soldiers opened fire and killed Iraqi civilians in circumstances where there was apparently no imminent threat of death or serious injury to themselves or others," said the human rights watchdog in a 31-page report.  The report, titled "Iraq: Killings of Civilians in Basra and Al-Amara," also criticized UK authorities for failing to conduct investigations into the killings of civilians, citing the case of the death of 8-year-old Hanan Saleh Matrud last August near Basra as an example.   Saleh stood with other children about 70 meters from a British armored vehicle that stopped near the entrance of the alley which leads to her home.  According to eyewitness Mizher Jaber Yassin, a soldier aimed and fired a shot which hit Hanan in her lower torso. She died the following day.  In a letter sent to the victim's family, dated Oct. 13, 2003, British military authorities claimed that the patrol of two Warrior vehicles of B Company of the First Battalion of the King's Regiment had been attacked by "heavy stone throwing from a number of mobs."  The letter stated the soldier was concerned for his safety and fired a "warning shot into the air" to disperse the stone throwers. "The patrol then noticed a crowd of people running toward them from an area of buildings with a girl who had been cut across the abdominal area."  According to Saleh's family, the military police photographed the area, interviewed witnesses the day after the killing, and photographed the girl's corpse at the hospital. However, information provided by the UK Minister of State for the Armed Forces on Jan. 19, 2004 indicated that no investigation was initiated by the UK military authorities following the killing.  In its report, Amnesty International called on UK authorities to ensure that investigations were conducted into all suspected cases of unlawful killings of civilians and to ensure that such investigations were "thorough, competent, impartial and independent, and seen to be so."  Investigations should also include an adequate autopsy, a collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence and statements from witnesses, said the rights group.  Ahmed al-Karaoud, director of the regional office for the Middle East and North Africa department of Amnesty International in Beirut, said that his group released a report shortly after the fall of the Iraqi regime, explaining what responsibilities the coalition countries held as occupying powers in Iraq.  One major responsibility highlighted in the report was the protection of the rights and lives of Iraqi civilians. "That was on April 24, 2003 ... that is a year ago," Karaoud said in a press conference in Beirut. "We did so, so that (coalition forces) wouldn't say later that they did not know" what their responsibilities were.  "Only the Iraqis are able to determine their own political future. But monitoring human rights is an international task," Chibli Mallat, a Lebanese lawyer, concluded.

      He may have gone completely senile.  On the other hand, this administration has gotten very good at saying the most outrageous lies with a straight face.....   Being Dick Cheney By David Sirota There are moments in the life of every politician when the public gets an unfiltered glimpse of the person behind the platitudes. For the first President Bush, it was cameras catching his wonderment at a supermarket scanner. For Mike Dukakis, it was his bobble head impression in the tank. And for Bill Clinton, it was his pained effort to define what “is” is.  But we are rarely treated to the morsels Vice President Dick Cheney recently served up. By the time he had finished a trio of public statements, Cheney confirmed our worst fear: He is divorced from reality.  First, Cheney held up Fox News Channel as the pinnacle of objective reporting. Despite the brazen sensationalism and hard-right tilt that have made Fox the laughingstock of American journalism, Cheney last month told thousands of Republican Party loyalists that he “ends up spending a lot of time watching Fox News, because they’re more accurate” than any other media outlet. Of course, just last year, a University of Maryland study found that Fox may well be the most inaccurate news organization in America. The study found, among other things, that 80 percent of people, like Cheney, who watched Fox held at least one major factual misperception about the war in Iraq—a far higher rate than viewers of any other network.  A few weeks later, Cheney cited Wal-Mart as “one of our nation’s best companies,” ignoring its poverty-level wages, mistreatment of workers and repeated violations of environmental law. He claimed the company “exemplifies some of the very best qualities in our country—hard work, the spirit of enterprise, fair dealing and integrity.” He failed to mention the 60 federal complaints against the company for workplace violations, Wal-Mart’s decisions to lock workers into stores and charges that it doctored hourly employees’ time records in order to skimp on wages. Instead, he parroted the Wal-Mart executives, the same ones who are bankrolling the Bush-Cheney campaign, and called for “litigation reform,” saying the problem afflicting America is pesky workers who have the nerve to challenge corporate malfeasance in court.  Finally, amidst increasing U.S. casualties and international uproar over prisoner abuse in Iraq, Cheney said, “Donald Rumsfeld is the best Secretary of Defense the United States has ever had.” The statement effectively endorsed Rumsfeld’s failure to plan for post-war Iraq and his dishonest statements about Iraq’s (still non-existent) WMD arsenal. It also undermined Bush administration apologies for Abu Ghraib by giving a public vote of confidence to the same defense secretary who supported the brutal interrogation tactics.  As shocking as these declarations are, they are really no surprise in the context of Cheney’s past public statements. For instance, early this year, Cheney cited a document previously discredited by the Bush Pentagon as the “best source” of information about a Saddam-al Qaeda link (none has ever been proved). And Cheney continues to trumpet his former oil company Halliburton as a beacon of corporate ethics, even as the company bilks taxpayers and mistreats U.S. troops in Iraq.  Yes, these out-of-touch comments evoke jokes about spending too much time in a secure undisclosed location. But they also illustrate something far more serious: the man who in one instant could be president has lost touch with reality. His judgment is so severely impaired that he relies on Fox for facts, Wal-Mart for economics, Halliburton for ethics and Don Rumsfeld for security. Cheney’s psychological profile has become suspiciously similar to your “crazy Uncle Ned”—a man you don’t want anywhere near your family. And yet, just one heartbeat separates Uncle Ned from all of our families.  Pundits will say that nothing Cheney says or does will affect the election. They will point to data proving Americans have never before made vice presidential nominees a deciding factor in their vote for president. (What else could explain Dan Quayle?) But with the security failures of 9/11 and the casualties mounting in Iraq, Americans have a renewed appreciation for steady hands and sound judgment in the White House. That means the paradigm could shift, and the vice presidential candidates could face unprecedented scrutiny. At that point, Cheney would become the real albatross around the Bush campaign’s neck, the perfect symbol of an out of touch and out of control administration that should be voted out of office.

      500,000 protest Bush's visit to Rome    Rome, Italy, Jun. 4 (UPI) -- Thousands filled Rome's streets Friday to protest President Bush's visit and their own country's involvement in the Iraq war, CNN reported.  Police deployed some 10,000 officers around Rome as an estimated 500,000 protested Bush's arrival and Italy's active support of the U.S. war in Iraq.  Protests, which were largely peaceful, reached a peak shortly after Bush had an audience with Pope John Paul II in Vatican City. During that meeting Bush gave the pontiff the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. honor given to civilians.  On the first stop of his 36-hour European tour, Bush also met with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a supporter of the Iraq war.   The prime minister has committed troops to the conflict despite the opposition of a majority of Italians. Twenty Italian soldiers and four civilians have been killed in the war.  On Saturday, Bush travels to Paris to meet French President Jacques Chirac, another war opponent, before heading to Normandy on Sunday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasion.
