       So the new maps for SC:PT are only available if you buy them for $5 USD (6.82 CAD).  I don't know if there are other games that have done this, or not, but it's certainly the first game that I own that has done this.  Frankly, I think it sets a disturbing precident.  So in addition to buying the game ($64.99), subscribing to Xbox Live (Starter Kit: $99.99 CAD), they now want another 6.82 for 2 new maps.  Whats next? Pay-per-use downloadable content? "Only 10c/min to play on this map!"   Yeesh.

       Alright, so maybe I'll try this blogging thing for a bit and see how it suits me.

       Today I go to work out for the first time in... well... ever.  I'm meeting my girl at lunch and we're going to the 'Downtown Y'.  I'm somewhat excited.  After 5 years of hardcore computer jobedness I would like to try reversing some of the damage sitting in front of a computer for a living has done to my body.  Good times...

       Let's try an experiment.  I have some Gmail invitations to use.  So the first person to comment on this post will get a gmail invite.  Be sure to provide an email address for me to send the invite to.  Considering I've only had this blog up for a week or so, I suspect I'll get no responses, but we'll see.

       So, in case anyone is reading this (which is unlikely...) Mozilla FireFox 0.9 is now out.  Get it here:  urlLink http://207.200.85.49/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9/    urlLink The Burning Edge  has a great  urlLink rundown on whats new  so I wont bother repasting the what's new etc.  Oh, and the new centralize repository for themes and extensions  urlLink update.mozilla.org  is completely convulsing under the load... so no themes/extensions for a few days it seems.

       I'm not going to get into the details, but since I'm giving 'blogging a whirl', I thought I'd mention for posterity that tonight was a little rough.  But I'll survive.  On a completely unrelated note.... Watched  urlLink Pitch Black  tonight.  It was the first Vin Diesel headliner I've watch in its entirety and I have to say that maybe I warming to him a little bit.  When he first started making it big I got the impression the guy was a doof... but perhaps I was wrong.  Time will tell.

       So... one weekend after having opened this blog, I find I have little, if anything, to share with the world.  I DID howver, bite my tongue so hard it's bleeding.  Good times...

       Can anyone tell me why, for weeks, I thought that  urlLink The Chronicles of Riddick  was a  prequel  to Pitch Black?

       I finally got through my RSS backlog.  The daunting pile of articles reached 450 or so yesterday.  Today I just skimmed the more interesting feeds, and 'Mark all Read' a few of the duller feeds.  Sigh.  Anyways, done.  Anything of interest to post about?  Not really.

       Oh yeah, the other thing with being away for the weekend, is coming home to find 339 items waiting in my RSS feed agregator.  I hate just clicking 'flag all read' and banishing them, but it takes so much time to parse through to see if anything interesting happened.  On the other hand, it's somewhat nice to have top-news stories archived so, when something big has happened over the weekend, while I was away from all sources of news, I can see what the hub-bub was about.  I quite like my RSS reader setup.  It's a heavily-modified version of  urlLink Feed on Feeds  that looks something like this:    urlLink      I quite like it. :)

       Well, as much as I love summer... I find that I haven't had a weekend to myself since god-knows-when.  From travelling to weddings, visit friends in other cities, having guests, I can't recall the last time I just had a weekend to hang out.    Don't get me wrong...  I enjoy having things to do etc., but it's been a little exhausting.    Anywho... off to the gym for lunch. :)

       So according to  urlLink this   urlLink Rottentomatoes.com  has been aquired by  urlLink IGN . This is really unfortunate.  I used to be a big fan of IGN for it's game coverage, but over the last year or so the site has been rendered more and more unreadable in favour of larger and more intrusive advertisement.  I fear that under the new management, Rotten Tomatoes will suffer the same fate.  I suppose time will tell.

       So the reviews are coming in for  urlLink Spider-man 2  and they seem to be overwhelmingly good.   urlLink Rottentomatoes 's tomator meter is  urlLink reading : FRESH - 100% (34 reviews: 34 fresh; 0 rotten; average review: 8.5/10) which is pretty astounding.  Ebert (the critic I most repesct) has this to  urlLink say  in his 4(!) star review:  Now this is what a superhero movie should be. "Spider-Man 2" believes in its story in the same way serious comic readers believe, when the adventures on the page express their own dreams and wishes. It's not camp and it's not nostalgia, it's not wall-to-wall special effects and it's not pickled in angst.   So anyways, I'm psyched.  Can't wait to see it.

       So since I've got nothing to do and I'm a little bored... maybe I'll show you guys a little glimps of the stuff I do for my own amusement... the following is a little php script I wrote to present disk usage:     urlLink

       According to  urlLink this  [millenniumfalcon.com], the upcoming DVD Releases of the original Star Wars films are going to feature several alterations. One of the more upleasant changes:     Episode VI: Return of the Jedi:  * Hayden Christenson has replaced Sebastian Shaw only in the Force Ghost shot.      The above claim is further backed by the following  urlLink post  [millenniumfalcon.com], which contains the this screencap:

       So blogger has a  urlLink bookmarklet  for quick-and-easy posting on pages that you view.  Perhaps this might kick start more read-and-respond postings.  We shall see.   urlLink Blogger Help : What is BlogThis! ?

       So someone has finally found the perfect compliment to the sleek designs, the smooth curves of the ipod design.  I just have to say, I'm spellbound by the beauty of this ipod case:   urlLink The iPod superCase - Engadget - www.engadget.com
