      OK, I got some squash now, so I can start typing. Now the big problem with this is the urge to spill absolutely everything in the first post. If I did that, however, I would lose momentum and impetus and this would go nowehere fast, thats the problem.  So before dropping some bombshells, lets start with something irreverant.  How do people get muscles?  OK, I've never been a big guy. I'm usually the rake thin, nerdy guy who can't lift, catch, or do anything that requires skill, strength and dexterity. However, for the last 3 years or so, I've put on some weight, mostly through no longer being at  urlLink university  and therefore being able to eat properly.  So after splitting up with my last girlfriend, I decided to do something about it. The way I see it, if I'm gonna atract someone, of either sex, I gotta look the part.  So I now have a lifting bench, with a cable and extensions and all osrt, plus dumbells and a barbell and a curl bar and alll sorts, I also joined a  urlLink proper Gym , but more about that later.  The problem is, that it's done bugger all. I'm marginally musclier but not as much as I wanted given the time span.  Now, here's the thing. I've not exactly Mr Testosterone either. I'm certainly not hairy and I ain't gonna go bald any time soon. So, my warped brain gives me the idea of taking something to boost my chances.  ergo  urlLink 1AD  , urlLink Trenabol , and  urlLink 5AA   Now the 1AD I used right at the start of all this, and I kinda attribute the sudden results to it. This is all well and groovy so I'm using it again.  I'm also using the trenabol, as it's got some good reviews. It's very odd and is kinda like rubbing spunk all over yourself, and it's had zero effect so far ( apart from I slight scare I was growing boobs)  Now, the 5AA,I was taking about 700mg's of the stuff each day. And it's a whole world of bad news. From what I could feel it was like my prostate had grown to the size of a melon, the back of my neck was red raw from the glands flaring up, and my skin still hasn't recovered from the massive grease factor.   Anyway, since you can tell from this that I'm willing to try anything, can anyone recommend things to me, like a certain set of exercises? The instructors at my gym are terribly woolly at times and stick a bunch of cardio and stabililty ball stuff in with my program, so I'm getting a little disappointed with it all, which is making my slim motivation slip...:-(

      So, I was in the bath, which I haven't had for ages ( I'm a shower person), and I go through, in my mind, all the things that I've thought of that could save the world, or entertain people, or at the very least generate some kind of response, which when you come down to it, is what we all want.  So, I think wouldn't it be at least some level of good if I actually put these things down? I've tried a blog before, using Moveable Type, but there was more an exercise in me playing about, than actually putting my thoughts to screen.  So, this is my first post, I'm gonna publish it, then go make a coffee or squash, and then come back and write something proper.
