        Last night was awesome in that I got to see Ricky - the coolest person in the world - again since he went to college in August. Its seemed like forever since he left even though its only been like 3 months - I guess because I've gotten involved in so much in school life seems to have gone a lot slower then it actually has gone.   Since my Mom has been in the hospital I've been in a really bad mood - I guess because even though I'm consciously worried, subconsciously I'm a lot more worried then I let on? This is my Jr. Psychology Mind speaking... Last night at XSCAPE there were a bunch of Hip-Hop Bands and they were just giving me a headache - Cara went with me. It was pretty bad with Cara because she was too shy to go with me to hang out with my friends, but she had to be really critical of everyone. Whenever someone she didn't approve of walked by, she whispered some comment about them in my ear and it was really annoying. Finally when she left I went over by Ricky and he got the hint that I wanted to talk and we talked awhile. It was cool talking to someone about some of the stuff I've been dealing with for awhile (Jacob, Gabe, Ricky, Tommy, Becky - if you're reading this you know what I'm talking about) and I have like...the ambition to overcome this junk now.   Also this one guy told me off when he heard me call my Dad an ass-hole - and even though he was a little over-board while yelling at me - he somehow made me appreciate my parents a lot more then I did - which I needed. School has just been having a bad effect on me lately in terms of cussing and I got kinda a wake up call on that by someone online and several people in person. I mean when you slip "F" at church, its pretty bad.   If you're reading this and you're a Christain, or practice some religion where you pray for the well-being of people, please keep my Mom in prayer, because she got really sick a week ago (Sunday) and its pretty scary. They're going to (as of now) remove a portion of her colon and minor intestine - and I'm gonna have to take care of her for awhile - which is an honor since shes taken care of me my whole life - but if she has a bag or something with her waste - thats not gonna exactly be something I'm gonna want to deal with - how gross would that be if I had to empty her bag of waste? (ick)   Tonight when I was browsing around on the internet I came accross this "Blog This!" button on my Google Toolbar, and I decided to check it out - so that is what you're reading right now.   Finally today my $100 check came from Virgin Mobile - so now I'm rich! (actually after phone bills I only have $42 left.) I guess my money from the essay I had purchased from the text-book company and the report card money is going to really be needed when I buy Christmas Presents and CDs and stuff.

        This morning when I woke up - I knew immediatly I was like "REALLY" sick. I got a flu shot - so either the shot gave me the Flu, I got a different kind of flu - or I have a super bady bad cold.   My face is burning (but I have no fever), my head hurts, my ears are plugged up, my nose is running "like a student in a tardy sweep" and I just feel like crap.   It sucks I missed school today cuz I have a big test tomorrow and I needed to get help. Plus I had a chance to re-take my dance test and do better and I think I blew it.   I'm still fuming about my Dad's evilness...he didn't even care when I told him I was sick today *sarcastic gasp* and I think he brought this on by being a d*ck last night - all the stress.   My Mom's also sick so we're being sick together (fun huh?). I've been taking Zinc Pills cuz thats supposed to help you get un-sick but all they've been doing is making me get nausious - its not fun.   Love + Cookies Peace Out

        Right now I feel super sick. My head is hurting, my throat is hurting and my nose is running like a faucet. It wont stop and I've gone through half a roll of toilet paper - its hoorible I says!   I dont know if I have a cold or if I'm getting the Flu after getting the shot (maybe they gave me too much of the shot or something and I actually caught the virus it's self). But this hoorible. I really dont feel like going to school tomorrow because I feel so sick - but there are tests and a Mid-Term coming up in several classes so it would be stupid to miss again.   Peace Out

        Today was good at school - but when I got home it just got terrible. After school I had to go with my Dad to come to the Hospital to pick up my Mom. As soon as I got in the car he was like "You're going to be 'punished' for not calling me last night when Gloria got to your house". Since my Mom was in the hospital last night (got out today) someone was here staying with me so if the boogy man comes to masacre me, they can die along with me. My Dad is really...stupid about some things. So basically he's gonna take all sources of my Money because I didn't call him to tell him someone was here - and he was in bed - he wouldn't even have known until in the morning that she was there or not. Whats the point?   Right now I'm venting on one of my friends on AIM. I guess thats better then calling him and venting...atleast he doesn't have to hear me all worked up...But what are friends for?   Today should have been a happy day. I got my report card - all A's again except one B in PE - plus my Mom got out of the Hospital - but my Dad just has to ruin everything. He's ruined my life. He doesn't even know who I am, what I stand for, what I like to do - what I dont like to do. Its really sad. Everyone tells me how lucky I am that my Dad stuck around when my parents got drivorced - cuz a lot of parents leave their kids...but how lucky was I really if I have to deal with this s**t all the time?   I guess it helps me to like get all this stuff out on the net - it lets me vent a little and then I might not start telling someone off for something simple tomorrow. Ok - now that I'm done writing about all the crap. Heres the good stuff. Today my grades just rocked, and I did better then I expected I would do on my dance quiz. I still think I got a "C" or "D" - whatever a 2 on the Rubric is, but thats still pretty good. Cuz I really was dreading today.   We went to the store and I got some new hair gel (I was outta it) and some body wash - my Mom spent like $106 on medicine (man is that stuff expensive) and then I went home and cooked Spaghetti. It sucks that my Mom couldn't eat the Spaghetti - but its cool Gloria and I enjoyed it. It was pretty good if I have to say :).   Gotta stay after school tomorrow to get help (desperate help) on Geometry. So I better go and get my good sleep.   Mikie Peace Love and Crackers

        Right now I am so tired. I just got back from the Animal Feed store where I bought Rabbit Food, Cat Food and Cat Litter - and then Subway and I just feel like I'm gonna colapse.   Because my parents dont want me spending the night alone in the house - I'm waiting for Gloria Sampson to show up. I wish she would hurry up because I really want to go to bed right now.   Today in 6th period was interesting. I've been absent the whole time the class was working on Photoshop (and learning it) and today we had a test I was forced to take and I totally was able to take it. I think I probably aced the test. My little wooden people looked nice.   My Mom said she might get out of the hospital earlier then we all thought. She was able to eat today and hold it all down so she might get out tomorrow. And also she sounded super strong. I just got done telling her that I'm gonna cook her this huge Thanksgiving Dinner when she gets home since she was unable to eat during Thanksgiving.   Peace Out - Penguins - Ninja Monkeys - and Seals!

        Today so far has been ok, but I'm really tired of Geography Class. The teacher is really awesome, but she doesn't teach us anything - she either talks the entire period or gives us book work - so that basically makes her an over-paid baby sitter.   Ashley is being more evil then ever. Today she said this whole line of crap and I was able to fight saying anything sarcastic to her but I couldn't stop myself from rolling my eyes and she saw me and made a huge scene in the classroom. I hope the teacher does something to stop Ashley from being a mean person all the time because if not there will have to be a big deal with my parents going into school and all that.   Pretty soon I need to go on to Geometry and then Multimedia - then after that Ill get sleep (finally - I'm so tired).   Peace Out   Michael R Brant One Love - One God - One Way

        Last Night I got in bed at 11:00 and probably didn't fall asleep until around 2:00 am. I'm totally going to be dragging today. I don't even have coffee to like completely stay awake.   Today at school since I missed Wednesday I get to get a admit card for Wednesday, make up a quiz and a bunch of work *ick* and I have to find out how to get out of my truancy from PE Wednesday - cuz I was there...just not there (Misunderstood the teacher).   Time to get going - peace out

        Today I went to church and it was cool because we were completely packed down. I talked to some friends and really entered into the worship. We broke into our cell groups - although my cell group isn't the greatest. It has awesome people, but I have absolutly nothing in common with my group leader person. He's a rapper/skater where I'm a nerdy regular person. And since I dont feel I have anything in common with him, where I should feel I'm able to spill my guts and talk to him and other people in my group about "anything" I dont feel like I can.   After church I hung around a little to say bye to Ricky before he drives back to Texas,  talked to the Pastor for a couple of minutes and then climbed down the hill to jump in the car with my Dad. We went by my Mom's house and I changed my Cats' food and played with the babies a little while. Then we drove to the hospital, PVH, where my Mom is and I went and hung out with my Mom for about an hour. After that I came back to my Dad's Apartment and here I am now, being bored and updating.

        I woke up today at 8:00! I know I say that like "ITS SO EARLY!" but it totally does seem really early today since I was up really late watching Little Nicky last night.   Starbucks "Double Expresso" is keeping me awake with my whole 7 hours of sleep (whoopdie doo!)  Time to be off to church now - shall be back at 1:30.

        Right now I'm doing a lot of HMWK make up because I was out three days last week. I have a load of Biology HMWK to make-up, some make-up Geometry HMWK, regular English HMWK and then some Dance HMWK. Because I did bad on a dance test I'm doing a Dance Research Resport to make up for it and I have to type 3-5 pages which really sucks. Thats like a major deal, I cannot believe thats the teacher's definition of make-up work...and I have to write it on Ballet. How lame.   Today I was at school from about 8.5-3.0 editing the newspaper, but I got a lot of it done. My Mom was in some kind of strange depressive mood and tried to pull this huge guilt trip off on me - which really was irritating. But finally later in the day she cut it out. When I got back from school we went grocery shopping, to the ATM and then to check on my Dad who my Mom was all worried about since we hadn't heard from him - and it turned out it he wasn't even home.   I'm going to continue working on my HMWK and then get to bed. Right now I'm feeling sick, but hopefully in the morning I'll feel better and make it to church.

        Today was an average day at school. In Multimedia I finished up the photo editing Travel Photo things and tomorrow I will probably be a roaming aide to helpout the desperate freaking out people who aren't finished or dont know how to do something to their project.   After school I took Adan his missing work and stuff - and then I headed home. At home I did some chores and just basically messed around until it was time to go back to school for the Dance Concert. The Concert was pretty cool. The best dances were this one by Madonna "Hollywood" and of course Evanesence's "Bring Me To Life". The other songs (because most of the people were beginners) wern't anything to write home about.   Peace Out

        Today during school I was roaming around and finding out various things about the school swim team. I've gathered its a Spring Sport - not a Winter Sport and that I'll be one of three guys *blushing*. I found someone I kinda know who is on swimming, Liliana Ramos (surprised me) and she was pretty thrilled to hear I was gonna join up on the team.   I have this plan for a crazy work out (Every Weekday from 6-7:15 am at Loma Verde Pool (and I'm  soooooo  not a morning person - this will be interesting.) I've just found out it's either $1.75 a pop (to swim at the pool) or $60 quarterly (thats a better deal if I'm gonna stick with the deal). Also on top of the swimming I need to tone up (I would make people go blind if I was in a Speedo) so I'm going to start doing sit-ups, crunches and also start running more (ick - I hate running).   If I can stay motivated and do all this stuff, I'm going to be a great swimmer and well on my way to a letter jacket (You have to make it to Metro-Championships to earn a Letterman.)

        Today was a typical school day. I walked to school because my Mom is still sick and I should have gotten up early to go run (to make up my grade) but I really didn't feel like getting up for some reason - so I stayed in bed.   In PE we worked on technique today rather then the dance and the girls in the line I was in are very evil. I was like up in the front of the line and they kept like screaming at me to move and they all cut me. I know this sounds lame - but it sucked. What was I gonna do? Obviously I cant push them outta the way like I would a guy, cuz they're girls - and I'm not going to rat on them to the teacher; so I just had to live with being in the back of line. I guess my satisfaction can be that I'm still a better dancer then they are.   In Geometry today we messed around again, but it wasn't as fun because two of the key people I goof off with were absent today - so it was one goofer-offer and then the two serious people: our "Humble Leader" Marcella and Rachel "Our Secretary". We all have titles, because we're doing this thing where each person in the class (in a group) is assigned a project [or section] of Chapter 5 to teach to the class. My title is the "Substitute Person". This is actually kinda funny - I guess reading about it rather then being there makes it less fun.   In Multimedia it was a cool day. It really sucked because Adan wasn't there (he must still be sick) and that class isn't the same without him. I never thought I would openly say I have guy-friends who I "love" but him and several others are even cooler then "like". Not, like/love in a sexual way, obviously - but they're like...better then friends. Almost like people I consider to be brothers. Anyways - in Multimedia today I was the photographer person for this project we're doing there and that was kinda fun. Then Mr. Pearson took several pictures of me for my project that I had to erase the background on, and then I'm going to add my pictures onto a background of some place to travel to. Its going to be pretty fun I think - and they're going to turn out good.   After school I went home to where I finished clearing the backgrounds from the pictures of myself, and then proceeded to HMWK and eating. Dinner was good - consisted of some little mini steaks that my Mom cooked well and some of the best mashed potatos I've ever tasted. My Mom said she used whipping cream rather then half & half or milk - and man we need to start using the stuff more when making mashed potatos.   Right now I'm writing here, updating my Calendar and drinking really good Jasmine Tea. But I gotta get on to my Grography HMWK - so peace out.   Wanna check out my Calendar?

        Today has been a sucky day.   At school I had to get all the work I've missed for like a long time (fun fun) so now I have a major load of stuff to make up - and I had to spend my lunch break in Mr. Pearson's class to make up my absences where I didn't accomplish very much (and he had to deal with stupid students who dont do their work - I feel sorry for him)   My night has consisted of very nasty food from La Bella (they messed up the whole order and gave this dressing they call "Ceaser" and I also think I got this kind when I asked for "Italian" before too.) Then the cat ate too much or something and puked in three places around the house. After cleaning up cat puke I had to clean up her litter box that had Cat Diahrea and then also clean up the bathroom where the litter box was... Also the nights activities entitled one of the kittens getting stuck in the back of my chair (no idea how) and when I got up outta the chair it almost got crushed to death...Its my favorite of the bunch of kittens we have so I was freaking out and then my Mom started screaming at me (like its my fault) and she tried to swing at my but I grabbed her hands and stopped her. I've never wanted to hit her back more. She always blames every problems or issue on me - no matter how far-fetched it is.   My Mom's friend is over who luckily calmed her down and she has chilled out now. I wish I could just go in my room and be left alone right now. Its not my fault my Mom's sick and she expects too much. She thinks every waking hour I'm not at school I should be waiting on her ass hand and foot and if I dont she calls me lazy and says I dont do "anything she asks me to do" which is the biggest load of BS I've ever heard. Right now I've just had a crappy night and I usually would sleep it off but my Mom's friend who is giving her a break is sleeping in my bed - but thats better then having to deal with my Mom all by myself I guess.   I gotta go - peace out.

        This week/weekend since I've been sick on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday have been pretty miserable. My Mom has been super moody and just been insulting me like crazy. You'd think she hates me, but I dont know how seriously to take it since shes probably not in a right state of mind since she is so sick right now   I e-mailed some of my teachers to find out what work I've missed and only two of them responded so I'm going to have a lot of catch up to do when I get back to school on Monday (tomorrow)   Today I've been lazy pretty much. I didn't even go to church because its been raining today, my Mom caught the Cold/Flu I had, and I had no ride other then the bus in the rain (bad idea) so I watched a movie and now I'm on the net.   I've been buying my friends Christmas Presents and stuff and I just put a check in my bank account that my Dad gave me and I have a lot more money then I thought I had - which is good because now I can pay off my book and CD bills and Ill still have a surplus to buy necessary presents.   It sucks that I missed church today because I wanted to see my friends and since there was no XSCAPE on Friday because there was a Marriage Seminar - I didn't get to see them till today - so now I wont get to see them till Friday.   I found out one of my friends has been in the hospital for 2 days with the flu *shiver*. In San Diego we supposedly have some strain of the flu that the vaccine does not protect against - it just helps give you a more managable strain of the flu or something like that - so its cool the Hospital people were able to take care of Adan (the friend in the hospital). There will probably be a lot of sick people tomorrow at school.   I better be off. Still got more presents to order and all that good stuff. Peace Out

        This is going to be short since I have little time. Lately I've been really busy with Newspaper at school but we've been pretty productive. Its been fun. I'm now officiall the "General Editor". Today I had to run like 1.5 miles but I think 1/2 of the extra mile was extra credit or something. Today it was cool because we had 20 minutes to run atleast 6 laps (1/4 miles each) rather then run a mile and you're scored by your time. I actually made the cut today, so I guess it counts as an "A".   My friend Adan has been out of school now for two weeks, which is a bad sign since he was in the hospital with the flu, his condition likely got worse.   I had to go to the Assistant Principal over being harassed the other day, and unfortunatly I was unable to think of direct quotes (that the harasser was saying to me) so they couldn't do much about it.   I'm getting ready to get in shape for competative swimming so I'm going to start these intense workouts starting January 5th.   Today myself and a group of my classmates had to teach a lesson in Geometry, Medians of a Triangle, and we did generally well. Part that sucked was I spent like 3 hours putting together our notes, cool down and homework assignment, but then all in all we were probably the most organized group.   My Dad and I have been getting along terribly lately, so I'm going to generally be staying with my Mom for a while, and see how it works out with my Dad. Never know, we could start getting along again - although I'm not really counting on it. I think I'll have a much more balanced life staying with my Mom. Its a pain going back and forth.   This week I'm going to help my Mom by cooking some new recipies that she can hopefully eat. Last night we went to the Commesary and spent like $211 on all this funky stuff to go in the Asian dishes i'm going to try and make. One was this funky-fied vegetable that we eventally put back cuz it looked pretty gross.   One more day of school until I get out for Christmas Break and then we're off to San Fransisco for Christmas. On Christmas day as a matter of fact.   We're getting ready to get rid of the Kittens which is gonna suck, but in the long run it will be nice. One adult cat is a lot easier to care for then 6 babies. I just had to scrub like 50% of my Mom's room and remove poop from like all over.   Michael R Brant One Love - One God - One Way

        I've been super busy, so right now I'm posting just to keep this gradually updated, I feel like I've been neglecting my Blog.   Today we had to take the 4 remaining kittens to the Humaine Society and put them up for adoption because my Mom doesn't want to keep them, and it was pretty hard. I stayed strong and didn't cry, but my Mom broke down like three times in the little room where they ask you a million questions. We went inside of the actual place and looked at the kennels and they were like feline condos. They were rooms about the size of my bedroom (how cool!) and the cats had like these huge fort thingies to play around in. I would want to live in there if I was a cat.   After we got done there we drove back to Chula Vista and went to this Sushi place, but we forgot its closed on Mondays, so we didn't get Sushi, but my Mom saw one of her friends at the nail place next door and they stood at the car and talked for literally 1.5 hours...I was bored to tears. After we left there we went for lunch at the 50's Diner where I got Pork Chops and then we went shopping after that. At the store we went to, I got two pairs of pants, a sweater and some long sleve'd shirts which rock-cat-butt.   After that I went back home and waited for the skirmish with my Dad to take place. He finally showed up late " Howwwww Disrespectfulllll " as my dearest father would say. This morning I called him and asked to stay home just because I didn't feel like dealing with his crap and he tried a guilt trip that I kinda ruined. He was like "If you don't want to come over, then don't come over for presents either." So I was like, "Ok, then do you want me to mail your presents?" and it was really funny cuz he was speechless. He thought that would make me like come running over - where in moderation I could give a crap about his presents. No present is worth putting up with his immature crap. I would rather clean an oven or something. I could deal with that brain damage at school if I wanted to.   After our little supervised immature skirmish thingie, some of my Mom's friends came over and like completely surprised her since shes been pretty sick. They came with some awesome Philapino food that we like pigged out on (not literally) and it was awesome. Then they made Martinis and got drunk and acted kinda wierd (but it was funny.)   Misty, my cat, has been super cuddly tonight with me since her babies are gone now. Its been a little strange because since shes been a Mom shes been kinda anti-social.   Last night we went shopping at Horton Plaza Mall, went to Seaport Village and then went to the Hyatt 40th Floor and got Drinks and Poo-Poos. It was pretty cool. After that we went to the Navy Exchange (Dept Store for narrow-minded brainwashed Navy 'folk) and I got some new clothes - and my Mom got some new shoes and clothes as well.   Over the last weekend I saw "The Last Samurai" with Tom Cruise and "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" and they were both pretty good. Although LOTR was very off the book - they twisted around two of the major themes from the book. On the other hand, Last Samurai was the best movie I've ever seen in my life. I loved that movie a lot. I'm really gonna buy it. One of the best things about that movie was it had romance, but no sex and I don't recall it having any cursing either...which are always a plus.   I opened a few Christmas presents already and I got a new cell phone that actually has a plan rather then the pre-paid one, got some clothes, got the movie "The Ring" and something else I kinda forgot about *gasp*.   I'm out - Merry Christmas to all.

        For Christmas my primary gift was a trip to San Fransisco. We flew out from San Diego to San Fransisco on Christmas Day actually and left San Diego right at the start of a big storm. We flew into a lot of turbulance and the flight seemed to go pretty fast because my Mom's friend who went with us had one of those portable DVD player thingies and we watched 007 the whole flight.   When we got to Oakland Airport we took the BART (Bay Area Regional Transportation) which is a high speed public transit train (goes above and below ground) to San Fransisco and then took a Taxi from the BART Station to our Hotel. We stayed at the San Fransisco Carlton and it was pretty nice. They had free Wine and Cheese and all that good stuff in the lobby (too bad I'm not 21) free for adults - so that shows how nice it was. Anyways, after we un-packed we went to this little Resturaunt down the street that was Italian (all the people who worked there including the cook were Chinese) and we had some pretty good food. I ordered Veal Parmasagne (one of my favorite dishes) and then we went back to the room and hit the sack. After flying all day we were all pretty tired.   On the second day we went down to Lombard Street on the Cable Car and then to Fisherman's Wharf, and later on to Japantown. At Japantown we went to this Japanese Buffet place and got all this awesome Japanese food that would have cost a fortune at a non-buffet resturaunt. After that we went to all these cute little Japanese stores and bought some cool stuff. After that we went back to the room and crashed.   On the third day in San Fran we went to Chinatown where we looked at leather jackets, eat some dim sum and I bought this cool Dagger thing (my xmas present to myself.) We took Gail to the BART Station for her ride home and then my Mother and I got on the MUNI Metro (A Public Train that runs just in San Fransisco - above and below ground) to Haight/Ashbury, this area where all the hippys used to hang out and we went in some really curious stores. One had a bong that was larger then I was...and I'm pretty big. After that we went to a Coffee shop and got some Tea, and then went to this Cheese store and got some Gouda and this nasty Non-Alcoholic Peach Wine Stuff. We took the MUNI back to our hotel and then watched TV for awhile and crashed. On the 4th Day we went to Chinatown again and bought leather jackets (my Mom and I both bought them.) Later that day we went to Union Square (the 7 story Macys) and later went to Japantown - back to the same Buffet we went to on day #2.   The last day we stayed in our room (it was stormin' in San Fransisco) and we took the Bus to the BART Station and took the BART back to Oakland. We rode the AirBart to the Airport in Oakland and then departed back to San Diego. On the flight I actually fell asleep for like the 2nd time every I fell asleep on a plane to be woken up by this little kid behind me screaming about "PIKKKKKKACHU!". I wanted to turn around and strangle the little kid....   We got back home "home sweet home" and just like hung out...today is the first time since Monday Afternoon that I've left home.   What I got for Christmas: Digital Camera, Phone, Sweaters, Phone, ReChargable Batteries with Charger, Cologne, Candy, Leather Jacket, Indiana Jones DVD Set, Bad Boys II DVD, Termenator III DVD and some other usuaul stuff. It was pretty good this year overall. I got my parents books and my Mom got some CDs too (Yo-Yo MA).   Yesterday and Today my friend Isaac Martinez came over to my Mom's house with his Laptop and I fixed it up for him and then installed a bunch of junk on it for him. He installed some cheap software on his computer that fried the whole operating system and I had to re-install windows and all the Samsung OS stuff that came with it. Then I put Microsoft Office XP, Macromedia MX, Photoshop 7.0, Imageready 7.0, and Flight Simultor 2002.   Peace Out - Happy New Year.   Michael R Brant One Love - One God - One Way

        Wow...its really been awhile since I've updated. But what can I say, I'm almost always busy as a teenager in High School. But life continues to get cooler almost everyday.   The last couple of weeks have been pretty awesome. On Saturday January 10th 2004 I turned 15 years old and went up to Anaheim California to go to Disneyland with my Mom and her friend Gail. It was a really enjoyable time other then my constant fighting with Gail because she is ghetto and wierd. We got the Southern California Residents two day tripper and went to Disneyland Park on Sat where we rode every ride except the rides in Toontown. And we went to The Blue Bayou for lunch, which was a five star resturaunt inside of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride where I ordered Prime Rib and got Birthday Mouse. Gail took a used candle from my Birthday Mouse and put it in her purse. Maybe she'll try to sell it? Thats what I mean by Ghetto. And we still have a day in California Adventure which were going to use around the end of the month, the next weekend I'm with my mother.   Right when I got back from Disneyland and went back to school on Monday the 12th, I was completely loaded down with work in school. The whole week I was completely stressed out with finals coming up and I was kept very busy. Most of the week I was running on caffine. Thank God for Coffee.   On Friday January 16th 2004 I ran my Dance/PE running final and made a really good time. Where I usually fail the runs, I made a C on the final at 11:30 for a mile, which was really good. Dance/PE is the class I was most stressing about. And I took a Geometry make up test on which I scored well too. I got a 79%, and even though thats a C, its still good. It didn't drop my grade that much, I still have a 93%. I'm hoping to makeup for the grade a bit on the final and get it up to a 94% so I have a flat A, rather then an A-.   For my B-day, belatedly, my Dad took me shopping and I got some clothes, some new Vans and three DVDs. The DVDs were Pirates of the Caribbean, Underworld and LOTR: The Two Towers (Extended.)   Also Adan Padilla and I were working on our Multimedia Final as a team and produced a pretty cool looking, but amateur animation in Macromedia Flash. He came and hung out at my Mom's house and we worked on the animation for four to five hours and he ate over there. We bonded quite a bit, I learned some interesting things about him, and then he took off home at around eight pm.   I've started a web design buisness as well, and I've been having quite a fun time doing that. I'm making quite a lot money and hopefully I'll go somewhere far with the skills I'm developing.   Also this week, I've heard back from Michael Inzunza, the school district magazine (Blurb) editor and he is going to publish the Blurb article I wrote in, came to my school and took my picture on the 'legenday soap box' and he's going to start working with me more. So I'm going to have a lot more opportunities with Blurb.   A bad part about me spending so much time with finals, my personal life and Blurb is that I've been neglecting the newspaper at my school - and since I'm editor and fought to get that role, I should be more devoted to the newspaper.   Peace Out

        This week my primary focus has been newspaper. Since Monday, every night, I haven't been getting in bed before 1:00 am. Its been crazy, but I've come up with some awesome articles. All the articles can be found on  urlLink TOG Zone  which is my website. There are some editorials and opinions and some hard news articles.   Blurb, which is the school district magazine has just published some of my works. Things To Be Thankful For, which is also on my website, was publised in the January Issue of Blurb and I made $20 off of it.   Since this is the start of the semester, I have to work back up an insurance grade. In English I had such a high average, that missing a couple of assignments would have still kept me at an A. Now I dont have that, so I have to work my butt off in that class. Also Biology, I had to arrange ahead of time with the teacher to turn in work late and still get full credit. Work that was due today, yesterday and the day before I haven't even touched yet. I'm going to do it Saturday during Saturday school and turn it in Monday. If I would have done it ahead of time, and got it in early I could have scored a bunch of extra credit - which would have also helped me in that class build up an insurance grade (my phrase for it) since I usually get a bad grade on most of the quizs.   My Union Tribune subscription has begun this week and I've been loving it. ITs soo cool to have a newspaper delivered to my day every morning so I dont have to go to the store and purchase one. I've been getting awesome ideas from the newspaper for stuff to write about and I've been working as a journalist to go out there and get people's opinions at my school so I can make my aritcles more interesting and related to my school.   My Dad was telling me that he can get back issues of LA Times free from where he works because when the newspapers get three days old they throw them out. That newspaper also has some interesting articles that I've been using. Although I still prefer The Union Tribune - San Diego's Newspaper better.   I just decked out my room in a 1) calendar with big boxes to write appointments in, 2) a white board, 3) a cork board, and 4) a mini board with a cork board and a white board. I'm getting more organized so I dont forget things I want to do.   I just read a proposition about ending world religion. This organization wants to pass an UN bill that will end all organized religion. Sounds like events from the book SOON by Jerry B Jenkins.   Its time for bed and I still need to do my chores. So I'm off - Michael   Would you like to comment on a post? If so  urlLink Click Here

        Whoa has my life been stressful the last few weeks. I did ok on my finals. Math I got a D+ which is a fair grade considering how hard the final was, and in Biology I had the second highest grade, which sadly was a C-. Whoever makes the final tests for Math and Science classes really have no idea that the people taking the tests aren't brilliantly smart or something, because those tests are usually an overkill.   My dance final I scored a "C" which is not fair in my opinion. I did better then a C...I deserved atleast a B, but an A would have been nice too. I think just because I dont kiss the teacher's butt she has it out for me or something. Also since its the end of the semester I've been working on clearing up all my attendance and I have to go to Saturday school to clear off two truancys, and this morning I was so tired I didn't go. I just couldn't wake up - so I'll have to go next Saturday which just sucks.   I got a check in the mail today from my boss (work on his business's website) and from this Allergy Clinic for refering a patient to one of their studies. That was pretty cool. Also with part of my report card money from my Mom I bought the movie "The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen" which was a great discounted buy at Blockbuster.   Today my day blew, I cleaned the garage much of the day and that is about the most boring thing in the world. Plus my Mom never just gets the show on the world. She kinda just messed around for two hours out there before we actually got busy and she wouldn't let me do anything else, I had to stay in the garage, but then she complained that I was just standing around. She needs to make up her mind.   Jackie and her mother came over today with this super smart little kid they baby sit and we did our late xmas gift opening thing with them and did dinner. I'd forgotten how annoying Jackie's mother is. Its been nice not having to deal with her since last October. We were trying to watch Underworld and every 5-10 minutes the phone would ring with her wanting something. I was ready to throw the phone out the window. She has called atleast 15 times before the night was over.   I'm really tired and getting ready to go to bed. Hopefully I'll be up to updating sometime soon. I've been so busy.   Also, grades came out Friday and I have a 4.0! I don't know if I already said this or not...

        Wow...I get less and less time to post here. Well lately I've been like super busy. I've been busy with newspaper, been busy with other clubs at school, been trying to apply for a job at Starbucks, trying to keep up my grades and really having no life outside of school.   My Mom was just in the hospital for surgery to remove a portion of her colon and intestine and it went well. She was only in the hospital four days, including the day they actually did the surgery which went like 4 1/2 hours. The second day she was in there, it was a little creepy. She had cords all over her and she showed me her scar from where they cut her open and it was really ick. There were like 6 staples, this little bottle to collect the icky drainage gunk and then like a thing that caught her urine and went up into her bladder (that must have hurt.)   School has been pretty busy. I've been giving more to Newspaper, and the advisor doesn't tell me about a lot of stuff. I guess maybe she doesn't think I've proven myself as editor or something? But it really sucks sometimes. I'm supposed to be the Newspaper editor and she like...just expects me to read her mind and stuff - and no one tells me ahead of time about upcoming events and such. I should talk to her about it or something - maybe it will accomplish something, maybe not.   Lately I've been getting ready for competitive swimming which is coming up soon. It's gonna rock. She also helped Rachel pay for her bathing suit and I've gotten pretty close to Rachel. It's nice. I just wonder if its because she wants my Mom's help or because she really likes me. But who knows, shes getting touchy and huggy - so that would make me thinks it's real.   On Valentines day I bought three roses, unfortunatly they only had red ones...but oh well. I gave one to my math teacher (she was a little...surprised I guess), one to Lilianna and one to Rachel. Rachel gave me a hug, Lilianna was shy and was like "from you!?" but she liked it. Mrs. Hernandez was "Thank you sweetie." But no hug... She probably thinks I'm a freak or something.   Last night I was talking to one of my best friends, and I told him something like really personal and now he's avoiding me...so I think I might have done something stupid by telling him...so I hope I didn't just ruin my life at school or something.   Thursday I went for a job interview at Starbucks Coffe Co. and I was interviewed and I thought it went all well and everything and they said I would know by Friday at 5 pm if I got selected and I never got a call back from them. So that sucks. Probably they thought I was too young or something. Oh well - not I need to find a job elsewhere.   I'm going to try and update more often but I'm usually really busy, so who knows. It might be every two weeks or so.   Random Thought: My New Years Resolutions fell through...   Would you like to comment on a post? If so  urlLink Click Here

        Again - whoa am I really busy!   When I thought I was busy before I didn't even know the beginning of it. Since I've started swimming I've hardly even had time to completely homework for school. Right now I've saved most of it for this weekend. I have quite a bit of Biology HMWK, have English HMWK and I have to make up some Geography HMWK because the teacher messed up and lost my paper or something.   Competitive swimming has practices every weekday and some Saturdays from 3:30 - 5:30 pm. I've been going to every practice and I've went from size 42 pants to size 38 which is really an accomplishment for two weeks time.   School has been as crazy as ever. I'm still pulling an almost 4.0 along with swimming and Newspaper. My life now officially revolves around like 90% school related stuff. But anyways, we got early grades, they dont actually come out until Tuesday and in Geography the teacher gave me a "B!" I got a B and I turned in all of the assignments. A lot of other people are angered and complaining as well as me. She was not the most happy person today. She even notices I was pretty mad. She was like "I'm sure if you knew VooDoo I would be dead right now." Fortunatly for her I do not know Voo Doo.   Miss Derwin is helping me step out of my comfort shroud and step up more and more as newspaper editor, so she is having me do a complete newspaper issue, which is good and bad. Bad - because sports isn't my thing and we're a little blank on it. Good because I can do things my way and not have to comply as much with how Miss Derwin wants to do things. I know thats a bad attitude to have...but I have a lot of good ideas that Miss Derwin doesn't always want to go along with.   I've had an interview with the Principal on the whole issue at school where we get detention if we're late to first period and I asked her if there is any end in sight...and she said no. It was an interesting interview, but she didn't want the evil administrator image I wanted to portray. Boo.   Mrs Angela Hermamdez is officially the coolest CPH faculty member who is currently living or who will probably ever live. She is really sweet, seems to really love /care about me, and she really bails me out of everything in her class. I really dont know why she does it, I've never met a teacher as giving as her. I mean...I so suck at math it looks like I dont even try...and you can see she thinks that, but she hasn't given up yet. If I had a student like me I would have given up so long ago.   We had a swim meet yesterday and I swam a 100 free, 100 breast, 400 freestyle relay, and 200 IM relay. I made 2nd place on the 100 freestyle and on the 400 freestyle IM. I got disqualified on the 200 IM relay and I scored last place on the breast. As hard as it is to admit this, Isaac Martinez, one of my best friends but also a long time rival, is officially better than me. I mean...my stroke looks so much better, but he is faster. I guess what I have going for me though, is I know how to pace myself and he either doesn't know how, or doesn't want to. On the 100 freestyle he only beat me by like a second though. My goggles came off when I dove in because there was not a seal on my face cuz it was dry, and they went down to my mouth. I was slower because I didn't flip-turn since my goggles were making it harder to breathe, and if I would have I could have beaten him because he doesn't pace himself.   I've been neglecting the Christian Club at school lately but I have still been going occasionally. Last weekend I went to ATF, which is Acquire the Fire, a Christian Youth conference and I had like a weekend of hell. Most people had a lot of fun, but I guess I'm hard to please or something like that. I had to share a room with this very ignorant guy and he made the whole room suffer with his ignorance. He was running up and down the hall like a savage and randomly knocking on people's doors with no regard to the fact it was late and they could have been sleeping and he kept the rest of us up with this stupidity. I would have liked to imflict physical pain to him...but then it was a Christian thing. And I'm not an agressive person anyways. I just wish I could do that kinda stuff where in reality I'm all mouth. (all bark no bite so to say) Anyways I couldn't sleep, ATF was really long, my CD got stolen, I got dirty water thrown on me, I got in the middle of a mosh-pit...and it just sucked. I felt like the people that were running the event from my church and then the ATF people couldn't have cared if I lived or died, and thats really sad when you think of your church like that because they are supposed to love and care about you like a lot.   Good thing I guess is I saw Ricky Valdez again but I didn't get to talk to him at all really. Just wassup, how ya doing, ok see ya around. Not that the conversation would have been facinatingly interesting anyways. He probably would have been preaching to me or something.   Lately I haven't really been wanting to go to church and my Mom makes me go...sucks. I wish I could just not go at all. I would have like more free time for other stuff. I mean, I can love God and be a Christian and all that jazz without going to waste two hours of my time. They should have drive up worship services where you get like a 10 second summary of the message and what it means to me, get hugged and take off. What difference does it make if you have to sit there for two hours?   Anyways I have a ton of HMWK, have swim practice at 9:00 am tomorrow and need to get started on the HMWK (I FORGOT MY BIOLOGY BOOK AGAIN!) Peace,   Would you like to comment on a post?

       Theres this one internet guy who I've known since like forever. And I've considered him a really good friend even though he's from the net, and vice-versa (or so I thought.)  We were like supposedly best friends and all this crap...and now he doesn't respond to my e-mails, respond to my text messages or IM me when he signs online.  Yesterday on my Cell phone I got a message "DukeBsktball13 has logged in" like way late at night, looking like he actually  sent me a message  after all this time. Its like "Yay! he doesn't have some issue with me where he doesn't want to talk to me anymore" but I guess I was totally wrong.  Now I've given up on him and if he doesn't want to be my friend, then fine, I dont wanna be his friend either. So screw it.  Hope I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt it.

       Tonight at 4:00 pm I have to go to this allergy place for my pre-park study appointment. I have no idea what they're going to do, but oh well. Its a load of money.  My Mom is being totally evil and told me if I dont clean the floor that she wont take me on Saturday to the park. She can never ASK me to do something, she has to threaton me with something. I sometimes wish I had a different, more polite, kind and rational mother.  She loves me, but she's evil.

       Last night I went to MOVE, which is a Dance Festival at Southwestern College with Linda Ramos. It was really cool.  They had some really good pieces, some ok pieces and two or three bad pieces. My favorite piece was this piece that was modern/hip hop dance to something by Missy Eliot and then my second favorite was this one that was kind of Arabic(ish) and had really great costumes.  The pieces I didn't like were a couple of really sleezy pieces where the dancers were dressed like whores (literally) and dancing to some music from Moulon Rouge, which was fitting to the costumes, but it was very untasteful and shouldn't have been in a dance concert.  Another thing I didn't like is between almost every piece they closed the curtain and turned the lights back on and had this long pause before getting started on the next piece.  My current dance teacher choreographed one of the pieces in the dance and today she was telling me that there were a lot of technical issues in her dance and she was really mad about it...but I didn't really notice them.  Linda enjoyed it and waited around with me after the show to see if my teacher was there...and I guess she escaped and took off.  All in all it was a really great experiance and I have some modern dance moves I want to use in my choreography project.

       Dance today was really awesome. We learned a bunch of new choreographical technicques and just kinda chilled with the teacher who kept it fun today, not to mention teaching us a lot too.  Tonight at Southwestern College (The community college I will be taking Psychology and Jazz Dance at this summer) is having a Dance Festival and Mrs. Macias choreographed one of the pieces, so she offered a load of extra credit if we go tonight.  For going we'll get a free run, or an A on any existing run of our choice. So I'm going to make up the run I'm missing to guarentee myself an "A" in the class. And if I miss the make up run next Tues morning, no pressure because I will still have a backup free run.  And then yesterday I talked to Linda Ramos and she's gonna pick me up and go with me to the festival which is really awesome. She's an awesome person thats a youth leader at this church I used to go to. I plan on going back to the church eventually, but they kinda did me wrong, so I don't really have my heart set on it.  Going to have to stay after school today to catch up on some math I missed last week due to the Dentist and then around 4 I'm going to go home, eat something really fast, do some chores, and then wait for Linda to pick me up.  ~Out

       Today at the Christian Club we had 5 new people! It was really cool. Also one of the new people was really like into the whole thing. She participated in the discussion about pretty much every topic and opened up about some of the stuff she's dealing with.  Its probably a good thing that I forgot my actual lesson today because then people wouldn't have been opening up as much. I had this Mini-Lesson on Faith that went really well because people could relate to some of the questions and voice their opinions.  Also there were a lot of prayer requests given to us, and discussion on that helped a lot too.  At the end of the lunch period we prayed and then I caught the new girl and gave her my number in case she wants to talk or anything about her situation but I doubt she'll call me since she doesn't even know me. But then I guess its the Gesture that counts.

       My Mom is like completely enjoying her grounding me from the computer until June. She won't even let me do HMWK on it. She is evil and something should be done about her.  Last night she made me wash the car by hand and she demands perfection so it took me like 1:30 hours where it could have gotten done in 5 minutes at the Car Wash for like $6.  Also this morning she rushed me out the door to school so I forgot all my Christian Club stuff and I had to come to school last minute and print out a lesson plan, which is totally not what it was supposed to be. Their online ones suck a lot...  Back to last night: My Mom's annoying friend Lora came over and just like spazzed out for 2 hours talking my Mom's ears off and she is a super-over-religious-fanatic so I love to get her started. I made a couple of subtle comments about Harry Potter and she went on a tangent! It was hilarious and fun. Then she went on a secant (like a tangent, but not) about Van Helsing and how the characters look horriically (I doubt she even knows what that word means) evil and stuff. Its like, "Lord - its a movie. Fantasy-Fiction: That means NOOOT real!" but she didn't get it.  She was like "That movie is evil! You don't know what my Kid's are like when they watch horror movies! They have night mares." Van Helsing, to start is not a horror movie. Its Fantasy Fiction based on mystical horror personalities.  Then she went on to say her daughter was having nightmares and hollucionations over the Sixth Sense, of all movies. That movie was a Sci Fi thriller that  sooooooooo  wasn't even close to being scary *sigh*.  Off to Dance.  -- Current Music: "Hey Ya" by Outkast Current Mood: Pessimistic

       Today my teacher in Multimedia assigned a new project. We have to Produce, Direct, Edit and find actors for a movie that is going to count as 80% of our grade. Should be interesting.  I'm working with:  Adan Padilla  Ron Soucey  They're both fairly cool people, I just hope they do their part. Never worked with Ron and Adan seems to be absent the day of the main work on any project. It would be coincidence, but it's happened three times so far, so I doubt it.  But then lately I've stopped trusting anyone becauase I've been screwed over so many times. So it could just be my pathetic paranoia. Who knows?  ~Out

       We now have a Quizznos in Bonita accross the street from my Dad's house! Today I went over there and got a Large Italian something sub and it was strange how much meat and cheese they put on the sub, but then I guess you get what you pay for, the sub did cost like $9 and it wasn't even a foot long. So like twice as much as Subway with 2 inches less food...but then I guess its piled down.  My Dad only gave me $10, so I couldn't afford Quizznos' soup, so I made soup when I just got home now. Chicken Garlic and Wild Rice. Twas interesting. Definately much better then that strange Thai Food from last night.  Oh: just remembered. I didn't note what we  actually ordered  last night...so here goes.  Thai Iced Tea  Wierd Garlic Chicken Junk  Chicken Thai Fried Rice (dont know why Mom insists on Chicken in everything. Pork would have been much much better(er).  -Out

       Today in 6th period which is my Multimedia class, I was an actor with a group of guys. Groups of two people are supposed to find a script and then get a group of actors to direct a play. I filmed and directed my own play on Monday and now I've went with another group as an actor.  In the past Acting wasn't my best talent, but today I think I did pretty good. I mean, it wouldn't take much to do better then I did last time.

       Man I'm so sick of going to the Dentist. Yesterday they had to numb me  Again  with Novacane, and even asking the Dentist to take it easy, my mouth was still numb for like 4 hours. They had to glue another bracket onto an exposed tooth, and then apply pressure to try and get the tooth to come down.  After I was done at the Dentist my Mom had to get a bunch of stuff done and as it turns out she has to get more then $2000 worth the stuff done on herself, not to mention the $400 she has to pay for my two tooth exposures.  While she had her stuff done I was in the car reading and then napping.  After leaving the Dentist we went to the Air Port and bought some tickets for Phoenix Arizona. We're going sometime in June. I have no idea why as we know no one in Phoenix, but hey, it will be a weekend of relaxation that should be really fun.  Once we left the Air Port we went to this Thai food resturaunt in College Grove and it wasn't too great. I did try Thai Iced Tea that was interesting but all of the food was greesey and had a strange sweetish after taste. Other Thai food I've had didn't have that. But the Tea, as I said, was good. It was regular iced tea with milk and sugar cain juice in it, which made it very unique.  Right before we went to the Thai place my Mom had to go in this damn Sorority store, because College Grove is by SDSU, hence the name, and she was looking around at all this shit she isn't going to possibly buy. She has to go in every fucking store!!! I'm so sick of it.  And then after the Thai place she went to Vons, a grocery store, to buy **MORE** food. Like we need more! Our whole garage is practically a store. And then she has both freezers loaded down. Then she says I want food? I occasionally ask for stuff that **I** actually eat. GRR...parents.  We went to Cold Stone after Vons, I got an interesting Ice Crea with Pineapple, Coconut and Pecan Pralines mixed into French Vanilla (wish I would have gotten Sweet Cream instead) and then we got home **LATE**.  When we got home I still had to Choreograph a dance (32 counts) and then do HMWK, so I was up until 12:30 am.  Then in the middle of the night, around 5:00 am I got up really sick to my stomach. I felt like my Digestive Tract was going to explode, and then I couldn't even go to the bathroom. Constipation is the absolute worst feeling in the whole world. So I almost didn't go to school this morning I felt so bad. I blame it  ALL  on SODA. No more Soda for me. I'm going to stick to Water, Iced Tea and Juice.

       Today in Dance it was really cool. We were doing the Choreography project and Mrs. Macias just kinda threw us into Choreography. She put us in groups of two (I'm a third in one group) and she told us to each make 16 counts of a dance and then we're going to put it all together and do it for the class tomorrow. We spent most of the period just experimenting around and don't actually have anything to present to the class as of now. So tomorrow it should be interesting just following the lead of each other. It will be just like follow the leader, alternate the leader and follow the next person. Or the blind leading the blind.  I want to do part of it with us on the floor, doing floor movements. Martha wants to do the beginning of the dance to a leap ending us up on the floor. And Brianna I have no idea what she wants to do. She never comes to school anyways, meaning she probably wont even be here tomorrow.  So yeah.

       There are really ignorant fools in my 4th period class. They spend like the whole period screwing around, making stupid comments, interrupting the teacher, making rude sexual stuff, humping each other, etc.  I'm super fed up of that class. And the teacher, having no control whatsoever over her class doesn't help the bad situation at all.  Today we were having a good class until the teacher gave the whole class Lolly Pops and they started making crude comments to each other. Then they started like getting against each other and humping for this perverted guy, Carlos, to take pictures of them with his phone. He probably goes home and masturabates to the pictures.  The only good part of the period is we had some discussions about crime and punishment and I learned some more about Interpol, which is a really fascinating organization.  Right now its lunch and I have no food, so I'm really hungry. But then thats a good thing I guess, maybe I'll burn off my fat preserve.  After school today I have to go to the Dentist and get *more* surgery. I'm so sick of getting my mouth cut open. It so sucks. But oh well...soon all the surgery will be over and then I will have all straight teeth. The only next step after that will be bleeching my teeth. Then they will be white on top of everything else.  One good thing I guess will be a weekend with little to no work. Even my stupid mother cant ruin that. I have to go to this park all day to feed my allergies and they're gonna test drugs on me, so I get to read for like 8-10 hours on Sat and Sun. Two full days of relaxation sound really good right now, even if I'm being a Guinnea Pig.

       Because of my Dental surgery today in 5th period I was totally behind in everything! I have to come after school on Wednesday to actually catch up on the work and then I have to go after school on Thursday to take the test its self.  Today in class I caught up on a worksheet while the rest of the class took a test, its really awesome the teacher cut me slack and didn't make me take the test today. So I read a lot of the period too, was fun.  Now the next thing we're doing in the class is going to be fairly easy, since its Special Polygons, which we're already covered. She just kicked them up a notch.  After school I  neeed  Tortillas! So I'm gonna cook some from this one recipe that I got on Food Network. Should be fun. Lets hope I dont destroy the kitchen this time along.  I'm in 6th period right now getting ready to shoot a practice movie. GRR.

       Today 4th Period was completely terrible. Its usually terrible, but today it was even worse. The stupid immature people were like making hateful racist comments, hateful homo phobic comments and just being evil.  They interrupted the whole period and the teacher was like really frustrated too, but she never does  anything  about the stupid people and what they do. She lets them treat her like crap. I dont get it.  Dance was really cool today, we did choreography exercises and took notes and then I had to go to 4th period and it just ruined the entire mood.

       My Mom is really starting to get on my nerves more and more. She is really evil. She's irrational and really seems to dislike me these days. Last night she was an all time evil. She was telling me that if I don't kiss her ass that she wont do anything for me.  We were at Cold Stone Cremery last night and she was like "Enjoy this Ice Cream because this is the last thing I'm gonna ever get you if your attitude doesn't change."  That means if you don't kiss my ass, then I don't do anything for you.  And who knows, this may even include clothes or something. I mean she is a really twisted vendictive person, so who knows.  I think once my Mom has no more power over me then we will be really good friends, but she doesn't seem to be able to handle power.  At this point, per advice of a friend, I'm just thinking "only three more years, only three more years..." Can't wait until college to get away from her. I mean, I love her but I hate her too. She's my Mom, I couldn't not  love  her, but I can't stand her like 90% of the time.  Its sad she had to do all that stuff on mother's day of all days.  Also last night I had to stay up all late and do HMWK, it wasn't too fun. I was up till like 12:00 am and when I got up this morning, I was dragging.  I thought it was really cool on Survivor last night when the guy, Rob, proposed to the other girl on Survivor, the one who won. Only bad thing is his motives. Who knows if he really loved her, or just proposed so he got money either way. It would totally suck to marry someone for money.  Right now I'm off to PE. Hopefully we'll continue to work on the Choreography project today. Good ol' third period.

       Today for mothers day my Mom was having a really hard time. She lost her mother like two years ago and has been just having a really hard time. Today she was really snappy and I thought she had something against me until I put two and two together.  I gave her a card and some lotion that I bought at K-Mart.  She was out in the front yard selling stuff today, gift baskets and such and we sat outside on the front lawn reading while my Mom just hung out there. I finally went inside of the house because there were icky bugs in the grass and becuase I was actually getting pretty cold.  Then I went in and took a nap and my Mom woke me up with a blaring stereo playing "I'm gonna get ya good" by Shania Twain because she was trying to outplay the stupid stoner neighbors next door.  I've made a new friend on the internet. I don't remember her first name, something Turkish, but she used to be an admin on Hoggies Moo and we kinda hit it off, which rocks cuz most of the people on there, excluding only a few, are evil cliquish, angry psychos that hate me.  I've bene also having some interesting political debates today with people. Been fun. At my friends house right now. Not technically supposed to be on the internet at all, but what Mommy doesn't know cant hurt me.  Also the New Blogger really rocks! I love it soo much. Its a lot like Live Journal now and its free. Give it up for the awesome people from Google!  Out--

       Busy Life lately. I’ve been doing Newspaper still, been doing competitive swimming, had several holidays, been on several vacations, had oral surgery, been at war with both parents and a lot more fun stuff.  Through swimming we’ve had very few male swimmers because two quit, one transferred schools and two others weren’t eligible (the un-eligible ones are our fastest and best guys) so that left three guys. We aren’t bad swimmers, but we’re definitely not the best either. Of those three guys, I was probably the worst of the three, maybe the second worst. But this one guy I’ve known since like 4th grade, Isaac Martinez, is much better then me, and he reminded me of that everyday of swimming (hence the season, at least for me is over.) My theory behind rubbing his speed into my face is that I’ve been better at him in pretty much every other area since like 4th grade. Smarter, got all the positions of power (Student government and club chairs), been more outgoing, etc. The only things he’s better than me at are getting the girls, and swimming. But then my swimming stroke looks better than his, and I’m not into girls, if you get what I mean.  Swim meets have been interesting. They’ve been swimming me in a large variety of events. My best events seem to be the 100 Butterfly, the 100 Breaststroke and the 200 Freestyle. I did moderately well at every event I swam, excluding the 500 freestyle. Although I’m really happy the year is over. It gets really old, really fast swimming back and forth across a pool.  Also, a lot of the people on the swim team had something against me. There is a large clique on the team that includes the majority of the girls and their humble leader didn’t like me, so they didn’t either. Plus blurting out my opinions didn’t exactly help. Christina, Jessica, Isaac, David, Denise, Abigail and Alya were the only people I got along with really well. Without them I wouldn’t have been able to bear this season, because the other people just ignored me. Jessica even at times didn’t talk to me much because she was involved with the clique a little bit and understandably would rather have like 20 friends then just me. She was never mean like the cliquey people, but not super friendly either.  In school I’ve been doing a lot better in all my classes, excluding Multimedia because I’m rarely there due to swim meets and other things at school. That’s the class that’s the least important to me, so I don’t do near enough work in it. In Dance I’ve been doing much better and I can’t stress how cool the teacher, Mrs. Macias is. She has become my favorite teacher, or second favorite teacher. She is awesome, she encourages us, and the other day when two girls didn’t feel like running because of the heat, she started running with them. That gave me a tremendously larger amount of respect for her. And I already had a major amount of respect for her before that incident.  Lately, per advise of Miss Derwin, the Newspaper Advisor at my school, I’ve been getting involved in this organization known as book crossing. Its basically where you trade books with people through the mail, “forget” books places for people to pick them up, read them, recycle them and log them on the website, tracking them on their journey around the world. I’m #51 in California as of right now, out of 18,000 people in the state, which is quite an accomplishment. They measure your rank based on how many books you register and such.  During Spring Break I went to Avalon, Santa Catalina Island which was really fun. My Mom and I had a couple days of relaxation. I went kayaking, snorkeling and just hung out. I also probably gained weight from all the Ice Cream and awesome food I ate there. To get to Catalina, you take a boat from either Long Beach or Dana Point California for 30 miles to Catalina. Since we had a high-speed boat it only took around an hour, but on a regular speedboat it would take quite a long time. Perhaps 3-4 hours.  My GPA at school is still staying up. On the last report card, 12-week mark, I only had one B in Scholarship and only one B in Citizenship. So I had a 3.87 in Scholarship and Citizenship. I need to haul ass to get it to a 4.0 though.  I’ve been doing a lot of reading and been working on my website too. Also in my free time, which there is little of, I’ve been back on Hogwarts Moo but I have concluded half of the people on there are evil and deserve to have their whole bodies waxed, or other equally painful deeds.  Listening to more and more country music these days. Not say that I’m a country fan now, but I’m into Shania Twain and the Dixie Chicks now. They’re pretty good.  This summer I got into Southwestern College. Through persistence and filling out petitions and having forms signed by my school guidance counselor, the Dean of Outreach accepted me. Only bad part about the whole SWC thing is that one of my classes, the Dance one with Macias, my current dance long term-sub starts on June 7th and my school doesn’t end until June 18th, so it should be fun keeping good grades at both places.  Not much more to write, I’ll try to update more frequently.   Would you like to comment on a post? If so  urlLink Click Here

       Just saw Troy and it was really interesting. And man if I can say so, Brad Pitt has a nice butt (just kidding) - although I'm pretty shocked he was compeltely nude in the movie - that was different. Especially cuz he's married. I mean, he had to at least me somewhat aroused rubbing against a naked person...that would be hard (figuratively and literally).  Anyways, here is my review on Troy: Troy combined a lot of fine characteristics that a good movie needs. It had a love story, some moral lessons, history (I dont know if it was mythology or real history though) and it involved fighting.  Throughout the movie it showed Brad Pitt (Achilies) and his emotional battle through life. He tried to be tough but through several emotional losses throughout the movie, it showed he really does posses love and above all else, honor.  Orlando Bloom's (Paris) character was a little disappointing. He had very little honor through the movie (until the end) and just...wasn't the typical character that Orlando Bloom plays. Although Orlando got naked too, always a plus for the lustful girls in the audience.  All in all the movie was very entertaining and Brad Pitt will probably win an Oscar for his role as Achilies.

       I'm almost able to say that I hate or at least strongly dislike my mother. Everyday she pushes me away more and more, in every way possible - and whats really sad is she thinks we're really close.  I used to be able to talk to her about anything and she seemed like she cared and showed compassion toward me. Now I dont talk to her about anything because no matter how good or bad something in my life is, she blames it on "the computer" and then either grounds me from it long term or carrys on about it for a long time. She is either jealous because I like technology more then her (I wonder why?) or she is disillusional and having problems accepting that society is almost completely centered around technology.  She goes on and on about how I have it so much better then her. Her Mom was always out running around looking for men, sleeping around, etc. She was molested by her mother's many boy friends. So my Mom doesn't date. So she uses that to justify how she treats me.  She is also the cheapest person I've ever met. She never wants to spend money unless its on food. I dont know if she thinks shes going to be buryed with her money or what, but she just hordes it up and she's pretty loaded.  Today she called me and almost immediatly she started nagging about something. She added two days to my "sentence" of no computer until June (that started because I said it was immature to say you hate something whole when you're only familiar with part of it) and ways...continuing from where I left off, she added two more days to my sentence for me not making my bed to "her liking." And then she added two more days for me explaining to her what the movie "The Village" is about.  My biggest pet-peeves about how she acts is that her gods are the television and the phone. She swears shes never on the phone, but like...whenever I call shes like "I'll call you back, I'm on the phone right now" so shes in denial about it...  Then at home whenever I go in the room where she is, shes like "shh! I'm watching tv! You always interrupt me when I'm watching tv!" so I ask her when I should talk to her since shes always watching tv or on the phone and I'd be "interrupting" and she says "during a commercial". She records every channel from 8-10 every night (we dont have cable so thats only like 5 channels...imagine if we did have cable) so she fast forwards during commercials, so that gives me like 20 seconds tops.  Then when I'm doing something, being on the computer, reading, relaxing in my bed listening to music, etc and she makes me come into her room and "talk to her" which always leads to getting me in some kind of trouble because I usually am not to happy about dropping what I was doing and having to "talk" to her, so I "have a attitude" or some shit like that.  Right now I'm so fed up with her that I took the liberty of posting countdown timers in this blog and my personal blog (at the bottom and at the end of every post) of how long I have before I'm out of here and at college where she will have no more control over me.  Maybe when I'm an adult and I can tell her to go screw herself when she is being irrational we'll get along better. She wants me to be her friend one minute and the next she's my "Mom" and I'm being disrespectful. She cant have it both ways. But for awhile now, since probably last December I've been strongly disliking her and I wish she would just leave me alone. Given that if she did "leave me alone" I probably wouldn't be as good as I am, but still.  I haven't even had a childhood past the age of four or five because she has treated my like an adult my whole life and when I do something thats remotely "teenage" she gets all pissed and punishes me. My Dad says she's substituting me for her husband that she doesn't have anymore but where a husband is a consenting adult I'm not and she can control me. Dont take that last comment wrong like we have an incestuous relationship or something *gag* thats just sick demented thinking. I sure hope my Dad isn't thinking that... cuz anymore I dont even hug her.  Another thing too...sometimes she plays around and like hits me or tickles me or something and then I cant do it back "because I have fibermyalagia and it hurts me!" but she can do it to me to her hearts content. What wrong with that? Then whenever she has a chance she uses that analogy "if you cant take it dont dish it out"!!  Right now I wish she would just...move away and leave me alone. I'm already practically an "old" adult so...what do I need her for? My friends are always raging on me about how I need to act more teenage and stuff...but its hard. I've seriously never been given a chance to just be a kid.  On the other hand I've had a pretty spoiled life and stuff, but I want to be loved too. I dont think my Mom knows how to really love. All her anger that she just holds on to gets in the way. She is still holding on to anger from when she was a little kid and it shows occasionally when she explodes and starts screaming.  I look at my friends and how well they get along with their parents, how much they both love and like their parents. Adan totally clicks with both of his parents. Isaac and his parents like adore each other. Then this one youth leader guy that used to go to my church, Cornerstone and went away to college has literally the most perfect family.  The only comparison of friends to my family would be Lisa and Beth, and then they're like 200x worse off them me. But I'm not gonna touch that today.  Heard of Goodbye Earl? Well Goodbye Mother!  --                                           	       Countdown to my Freedom (From my Mother, that is) (Days/Hours/Minutes/Seconds)

       Yesterday I got my allergy check for $440 and I dyed my hair and eyebrows (Auburn). It looks pretty cool but the dye also stained the skin under my eyebrows so they look super thick. I cant wait until that skin sheds off so the dye isn't there anymore because it looks pertty stupid.  Also last night Lisa came over and we picked "Dare You to Move" by Switchfoot for my choreography project and did a couple of ballet/modern moves, but none of them truly apply to the song. I'm working on some lyrical moves, like //Dare you to get yourself up off of the floor// I can slowly get up off the floor and start the mid-level-change dancing (If this is Greek to you, comments on this and leave your e-mail and I'll give you a translation)  Today we ran bleechers at school (yuck) but I was able to get a "B" which I really need in PE right now.  Bad classes: Today in Biology we got a pop quiz and I totally failed it. We needed to know in what sequence blood flows through this strange picture of the heart and I wasn't at school the day the teacher taught that, so I died.  In 5th period it was super hard. Surface area of prisms. The teacher looked like she was ready to collapse too. Probably had an  exciting  night with her husband, if you get what I mean. Plus a long day at school and I was like "Mrs. Hernandez! Mrs. Hernandez" every 2 minutes because I was absent, hence lost, and needed help with my math homework.  In 6th Period we worked on the video editing and finally I have someone that understands some English. She is their VO (voice over person) so its getting better. During 6th period today I went to talk to Miss. Stratton, who is the Drama teacher, and I interrupted a rehersal and she got snappy. I went back after class though and she was much better. She was like "since you're not in Drama you dont know this, but NEVER INTERRUPT A REHERSAL." So I learned something new today.  Went to La Bellas for dinner. Also went to the post office and spent like $20 between two Priority Mail domestic documents and one international.  Also talked to Christian from Cornerstone. He's a pretty cool guy and it was nice getting to talk to him again, although I still think Cornerstone went commercial and that the Pastor is now speaking more for the general TV audiance then the people who attend his church. But then I haven't been there since the Beginning of February, so I don't know if that is still accurate.  Anyways, I'm out. Need to go burp up my Pastrammi Sandwich.

       Last night they aired the allergy park study footage that they shot while I was in the park study last Saturday and Sunday. Unfortunatly they had to cut everyone's interviews to a few comments each and decided to not show my interview at all. All they showed was me blowing my nose and during a little teaser before the segment aired they showed me sneezing.  I called several friends and asked them to tell me what they thought and one of my aunts said "You're a very good nose blower Michael. You cover your whole nose and catch it all." It was a very sarcastic complement which really lifted my spirits.  She was telling me that my cousins did a drum roll and then cheered exaggeratedly. So it was cool. My (literal) five seconds of fame payed off.  Tomorrow its back to school.  Today sitting at home I just read and chilled and did some sample choroegraphy to a bunch of different songs.

       On Tuesday May 18th I was feeling really sick. In second period it was so bad I asked to go to the nurse and she said I have some kind of virus thats going around. So she called my Mom and my Mom said to let me walk home.  Well on the way home it was really hard to hold "it" and I barely made it to the bathroom. The virus really sucked and it felt like I was being continually punched in the stomach throughout the day. Hence, the pain sucked and it really hurt(ed).  Yesterday and Today I was out of school and kinda just hung out at home being lazy, reading etc. It made for two very boring days. And yesterday I couldn't even eat anything.  Now when I go back to school I'll have to play  more  catchup with all the classes I missed. I'm still trying to catch up from the last time I was absent.  Also my Mom has been really evil lately. I dont know what her problem is but she has to get snappy and over-react and exaggerate   everything   and its getting really old really fast.

       I just looked at my bank balance and noticed that I'm $58 underdrawn. My Dad is probably going to kill me for it. Within the last few days I've been buying stuff: blockbuster, 7-11, etc and I paid my Mom...so I probably drew my account a little low, and then a check for like $60 cleared for Amazon.com and it hit me today.  So I'm hoping my Dad won't notice that balance that much...but knowing him and how nosy he is, he's bound to notice. I'm crossing my fingers until Thursday when I get my check for $440...it should knock my account back to where it should be. Then I need to keep some money in backup incase this happens again.  I'm also hoping he'll raise my allowence this weekend. We'll have to go over it and talk about it some more.  Gotta be off to math. Peace.

       This weekend was definitely interesting. As I sit in Biology Class, supposed to be working on a Physiology Project, I write about it.   5:00 Am Saturday Morning My alarm clock goes off. I jump out of my skin because I set it very loud so I would wake up right away, and it was successful. I slowly walk to the bathroom, in my comatose state, and turn on the shower, trying not to collapse in fatigue. Once the shower water heats up, which takes about 4 minutes because it is at the end of the hot water line, I get into the shower and slowly wake up as the hot water hits my body. After I get out of the shower, I run to my room and turn on the radio to get dressed to.  Once I’m done I go into the kitchen where my Mom is getting our food for the day ready. We get in the car, go to Jack in the Box, get some breakfast sandwiches, go to 7-11 to get ice and some hot dogs and then we take off to the park, Morely Field in Balboa Park.   6:30 am We park at Morely Field and start to unload the car and setup in the dirt under some trees. We pitch out tent for the day and setup out chairs. We’re ready to relax. I go to table 6 to check in with my study advisors, along with 200 other study participants. They hand me a “Weekend in the Park” t-shirt, and a bottle of water and then tell me to come back to the table in 10 minutes, and to stay in the immediate area of the setup area.   8:00 am After this time we had already had about 4 meet ups during which we had to fill out diary cards depicting out allergy symptoms for the day. I thought it would be an easy day and an easy $440, but I was dead wrong. They sure made us work for that money. Next, at like 8:15 we had breakfast. They served juice, Danish, fruit, croissants and muffins. We had almost an hour to eat this time and then we went back for a bunch more diary cards to fill out and got drugged at 9:00.   Placebo Group On the second day my allergies were much worse and I have concluded that I was part of the Placebo group, which is sugar water and doesn’t actually have any active ingredient in it, hence not preventing any allergies. I was dying and probably went through a grand total of 5 boxes of tissues. This worked in my favor to get me on TV though. Reporters from “World News Tonight” with Peter Jennings was there recording and they got me on camera sneezing my head off, blowing my nose and they then asked me if I wanted to be interviewed on TV. I was all for the interview and now am going to be on TV either Tuesday or Wednesday, they weren’t sure which day, but all the same I will air around the us for sure. My début of fame! (Yeah right)  We packed up after the second day, Sunday, May 16th and then went to Old Town and went to Guadalajara Café, which was fairly good, then headed for home. Once I got home I had to complete like 4 hours of Biology HMWK.  All in all, even though we had frequent diary cards to fill out, I had a very relaxing day, got to finish my book and got a lot of sleep.

       Awesome! I looks like we're going to Spirit West Coast which is this Christian thing that like...has some really awesome bands. Jeremy Camp, Sean Reuban, Grits, La Symphony, Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, etc.  Its expensive  and Jeremy Camp is like the only good artist on Sat...but either way I hope we still go on Sat and Sun.  Out-  PS: Looks like we're going to Irvine instead of Laguna Beach - but maybe I'll get to go to Wild Rivers.

       Those little "UnCrustable" peanut butter and jelly sandwich thingies are really really good.  The last couple of days I've been going to Albertsons and buying them and yumm! Although I do not need those calorees...  Also speaking of Albertsons last night - I swear I saw the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life there. I would have liked to find out how old she was, but then she could have been old and looked young and said something to the point of "Little Boy, I'm Married" and then I would have like crawled under a couch or something and died. (People in question see Losing Grip for a better explaination of "you know what")  Out-

       Today in English my teacher passed out these papers for us to like fill out and give to our teachers in appreciation. Well I got three and even though she is like one of my favorite teachers, I didn't get an apple for her because like that would have been wierd since I'm gonna be right there...instead I got her a book yesterday, but I handed her an apple to distribute to other teachers and she got all happy thinking it was for her and then when she saw it wasn't she looked bummer, which really sucked, I hope I didn't offend her or something. I'm going to have to send her an e-mail or something.  Yay! Today is a minimum day and I only have to be here until like 1:20 because of the Christian Club then I get to go bye bye and sleep or something.  Mom has decided that we're going to take an "Adventure" up the coast and just sleep wherever we can find. I think she has some fetish for beach camping, so God help us. I seriously hope we're not camping on the beach.  She says we're going up to Laguna Beach. Hopefully we'll be staying in a hotel there.  Also, upbeat/flipside notice, I will officially be ungrounded from the internet June 3rd. Its looking really close now! Yay!  Reminder to Self: Go to dumb Maraichi Dance thingie tonight to get an extra credit grade thingie. But then I hate maraichi, so it should be interesting.  And then next week I get to go to a cool dance show that will probably be mostly Jazz, but oh well, at least Jazz is usually up-beat.  Need to get back to class, announcements are almost over.  Out -  PS: In regards to Last Post, I can still Rant and Rave here! Yay! The AP just said to have a good attorney (joking) in case I mess up and people have an issue with it.

       I saw an Assistant Principal yesterday posting in a Blog so I opened mine so he could see it and maybe comment so I could lead into the terms of it and such and I found out that they, unlike Castle Park Middle, don't really care if you post in a Blog because he said the school doesn't host it. He said just to be careful with names and information that could be considered Libelous. But I've already been really careful with that, after the female Satan at the middle school tried to destroy me (exaggeration).  Umm - not much else to say, need to get home.

       Today in 6th Period I've like been working on this movie project for these other students and stuff and today GRRR! its taking forever. I have to render color into black and white which will probably take another half hour and has already taken another half hour. The group I'm working with, if you can call them a group gave me totally irrelevant video feed so I cant really even work with it that well. *sigh*  So it looks like I'm gonna be here until like 4:00 pm (and we got out at 2:00 today) to finish this damn project. what really sucks even more is that its like 80% of my grade for this semester...as well as a big chunk of this other classes' grade and they just dont care I guess. Its unfortunate. I wish I had better stuff to work with though.  Also today in Math we took a test. It looks like I did it well, the teacher made it so the answers are even numbers, but I sill dont quite know what I scored on the test.  Rachel is still zoning out. She didn't even try the test today. She just sat there listening to my Cd player.  Back to school tonight to go to this Ballet Forklorico (Maraichi Dancing) thing that will help my dance grade a little more.  Back to my movie making *yawn*.  Out-

       As you probably read earlier, I went to an allergy study and made $440. My Mom freaked out last night when I told her I was going to spend most of it on books and like lost it. She said she wasn't going to take me to any more studies and all this shit.  So this morning I ripped up the check I was sending to Amazon.com and transferred a bunch of money to my savings account and I guess I'll just buy the other books I want one by one or something. Its sad how much she freaked out though.  I dont know why I conformed to what she wanted me to do, and how to spend my money and all that. I mean - she shouldn't be doing that. She was telling me with books I'd have nothing to show for my money, which so isn't true. I still would have quite a bit to show for it. Just on a smaller scale. I wouldn't have like a TV or something, but I'd have a whole hell of a lotta books.  Anyways I have to be off to PE and get my Amazon.com Order straightened out.  Out-  PS: We're performing today in Dance. Should be interesting. Unfortunately my audiance is going to be small.

       In Dance today I took my stereo to class so I could work on my dance better and stuff and it rocked. Several people borrowed my stereo and I was able to come up with a few consistant movements.  Right now I'm in 4th Period messing around on the internet because most of the people are on a field trip so we're just like free today. Right now these girls next to me are looking for shirtless Brad Pitt pictures.  Anyways, the dance is going pretty well. I'm hoping to show Mrs. Hernandez (Carmen) my dance or something if she is able to download the song from iTunes or something.  At lunch, in a couple of minutes, I have to go to the FCA room and like meet with the regional lady thats coming down to give us the play books and stuff so it should be interesting.  Then after school I have to stay all late to work on a video for this project in my computer class thats like 80% of my grade and I have to render it all into black and white and its going to take forever, but I guess a project couldn't be more structured and easy as this project is right now.  What sucks today is that because my Mom is on strike or whatever and I had to walk to school so I forgot to grab water and I spent all my money at Starbucks yesterday so I'm like broke and cant buy and beverages. So I guess I'm gonna go get like money from a teacher or something I can borrow.  PS: Partially Nude Brad Pitt takes up the whole screen on the computer next to me. Hernandez encouraged the students to put it on there, on top of merely allowing it to be there.  Out-

       Today and I guess last night too my Mother started a war. She has been all over me about all this crap for awhile not and I guess now I have really set her off or something. She started refusing to give me rides to school (which I guess isn't too bad cuz its not that far and it will force me to /not/ be lazy - and gives her one less thing to threaton me with) and she said I cannot use the dining room table anymore because I had a book sitting on it and apairently that makes it look bad.  If she wants to be evil and be a bitch all the time, I guess I can play that game too. Example: hiding the TV remote, randomly turning off the answering machine and stuff like that. It will be subtle, but it will get her attention.  On the flipside, I was choreographing my Dance last night in the living room and my Mom seemed to like my moves and stuff, so I guess I'm going to stick with some of the moves.  Also the Dance teacher gave us a choice of performing for this one special education PE class and them presenting back to us, or we running, so of course everyone, even the shy people picked the performance.  I have to be off to PE.  PS: I've met some interesting people through this Blog.

       Right now I feel really depressed and just out of it. It seems like the whole consists of stupid people. They're all over. They wont leave me alone. I know what people that hear voices feel like, expect I'm sane. Stupid people everywhere messing with me, being annoying and being conformists.  I wish I had more friends, but I think I'm scared of being stabbed in the back and hurt more. I've been sad lately, I think out of loneliness - I'm pretty anti-social, keep to myself and stay home, etc - which I dont like doing, but I dont know any other way. My Mom has kind of encouraged it over the years and its just kinda stuck with me.  So I dont really know what steps I should take to be happier, but I'm gonna try it out.

       Soo tired right now!  Last night I stayed up late talking to this guy, Brad, whose information I just randomly saw on Blogger and I asked for a picture just to see what he looks like, and my Dad happened to walk in to a perfectly clothed picture but somehow got the wrong idea and started screaming for me to go to bed because its late and he's worried to death trying to sleep in there.  You see - my Dad, along with my Mom have major issues. Neither of them know how to just leave me alone. They have to control my every move in life, yet they want me to act like I'm an adult and never show any maturity. Its like, "why control me if you want me to be all mature and shit?"  Every night I'm over here, which thank God isn't very often, my Dad like...gives me a bed time! Its like "hello dude, I'm 15 I dont need a bed time. At my primary living quarters (my Mother's) I haven't had a bed time since I was like 5 and it wasn't even enforced then." He finds it necessary to walk in the other room 4-5 times to like "check on me" or something. If he thinks I'm looking at porn or some crap like that, I'd rather just be told no internet after he goes to bed. Its really annoying to have him snooping around and like saying crap like "when you gonna go to bed soooooooooooonnn" (he says "soooooooonnn" instead of 'son').  Anyways I need to go get ready for school *yawn*.

       I just removed the password protection from this Blog. I seriously hope I dont regret it later.  Also just read the terms of use so I know where I stand legally.  In the past, the administration of my Middle School found my LiveJournal (similar to a blog) and tried to persecute me in many ways with it. On top of that they tried to scare me, theraton me and discredit me among the staff members of the school, in my opinion lead by Janet Bonney.  This time around I wont give anyone anything that would potentially be damaging.  If you find anything that offends you, please let me know and I can change it before you try to take any action.  Also if you have comments to me, about how maybe I should put the password protection back on, please let me know via commenting.  Thanks-

       Ok - today has been trying of my patience. I supposedly have an "attitude" and am "talking down to my inferiors".  My Dad brings home a laptop that he uses to dial into the building computer to like control all the stuff since he's an engineer.  Well anyways he has major issues with scroll bars that he swears "aren't ever there" and he like harasses me into fixing something that isn't a problem. He also has issues with those little buttons in the right hand side (left side of mac) pc programs that open and close the programs. He was like freaking out over nothing.  Then he was saying some toolbar that he needs to control the program or something wasn't there, so when I finally got it open I told him it was on authohide and thats why he couldn't see it, and he was like "yeah I know, its supposed to be there". What was the point of all that?  Oh well...life sucks then you die.  Then he went on to tell me through this lecture that was really...pointless and I tuned it out and just nodded at the right points. But I was killing his "integrity" (not sure he knows what that word means) by talking down to him or some shit like that *sigh*.

       Did the filming for our movie today from like 8-10:30 at school and it went pretty well I guess. We got compeltely done with a bunch of different poses and shots in about two hours. It would have been faster if everyone would have showed up on time though. I had to call and wake Ron up, he had apairently went to a concert the night before, Shavelle was a little late but I'm just happy she showed up because I didn't get her number and we wouldn't have been able to do it without her. Then Adan, of course, came, although I had to call and wake his ass up too. He showed me his arm, his chest and his leg where poison oak hit it...and ick. It was really gross. And he put some kind of lotion on it or something for the itch and it made it look like some of the boils had burst and there was puss or something...it was nasty - and now I really feel bad calling him a whimp and everything last night on AIM because wow...thats like...bad. I would be dying, figuratively, if I had all that on my arm. He must have had a serious allergic reaction or something.  During the Saturday School people's 10 minute break between session 1 and session 2 at 10:00 we had people all around so we had to pause for awhile before resuming filming and this one guy, who I cant say I'm surprised had Saturday school as he is a nuisance in my 4th period class - wanted to moon the camera and I think I would have honestly been scared for life had I seen his ass... bad thought. But then since he's a jock, it mighta been good looking too, you never know with jocks these days.  Shavelle walked most of the way home with me and then departed to wait for her mother.  After we left the school, that is my Dad picked me up at my mother's house (LOTR3 came!) my Dad picked me up, we drove downtown to the building where he works, I sat in the car awhile reviewing my tape, he came out, drove clear back home to get his glasses or pager or something and then we drove back to Mission Valley and saw PoA (Harry Potter 3) which I think was really good, although I'm a little disappointed that they didn't show more of Harry's classes, especially developing his classes with Lupin. They showed how Harry and Lupin were really close and stuff, but they didn't show how that relationship between them developed. Also the ending was a little spuratic...but the movie had a lot funnier stuff then the last two, which was cool. Also it was a lot darker, more for adults and teens then kids like the last two. IT wasn't a happy world of magic doing and stuff.  What was really wierd is that the theatre had more adults then it had kids and there was this guy sitting next to me that was a space nerd...he was talking about how he wanted to make a car that had all these things you're likely to hear about on Star Trek or something...I was trying not to crack up.  After that we went to DZ Akins and I had Mish Mash Soup and a Corned Beef Reuban. My french fries were cold though...yuck, I had to ask for new ones. Then on the way home my Dad was telling me about how truly evil my Mom is. If that stuff he said is true, and I know at least some of it is, shes a lot worse inside then she is externally with me...thats kinda a scary thought. Is she going to get worse with her stupid rules and punishments then she already is?  Her last punishment, thou shalt not use thy washer and thy dryer was stupid. Thats like saying I cant use the shower at home anymore, I have to go in the backyard. Is the no more shower going to be her next rule?  Right now I have some HMWK to do and I'm putting it off...so eventually I'm gonna have to get to it. I need to:  Write Out Story Boards for the Movie I Filmed  Do my Dance Critique for "Last Chance to Dance"  and I need to update my Dance Journal thing  Other Stuff: Update Check Register  E-mail Mr.P about not turning in the camera on time on Monday   Excited about starting SWC on Monday. I dont exactly know what to expect but it should be fun nonetheless. I dont think Mrs. Macias will disappoint me. Her last class was a lot of fun. The only thing I'm worried about right now is that the permenant Dance teacher at my school is going to be super difficult on her grading like she was last semester and kill my grade, figuratively, on the final exam. Also I wonder if shes going to apply all my extra credit and stuff to my grade that Mrs Macias said that we needed.  Anyways, need to get to it. Out-  PS: Talked to Beth. Apairently her mother is suicidal since they took away her cigarettes or something like that. That family has sooo much drama.

       Tonight I'm kinda in a bad mood. I have to get up early and I just feel...exhausted and overwhelmed with life. My Mom is always on me and even thought we've made up, this time, I still feel like as soon as I get back home she's going to start with something else.  I've just kinda been sitting around here, bored. Doing nothing for most of the day and I have to get up all early because of these people at my school who procrastinate. We have to film a movie at school tomorrow and we have to be there when the administration people are there, so I have to get up at like 7:00 to get there by 8:00 am, so it should be really fun.  Then I'm sitting here right now talking to this guy thats in my group totally dying over Poison Oak. I could be wrong, he could have had a serious nervous reaction over it, but I think he's making a big deal over nothing to keep out of school...he did this the last time we had finals except last time it was the Flu, which I think he exaggerated too...grr. I really dont know why I care, its not my business really what he does and what his grades are along with this other guy in my english class that I nag, but I like both of those guys, they're cool...and seeing people like slack off and stuff makes me get on them...but yeah. Gonna shut up now. I should go to bed since I have to get up all early.  Out.

       Well I talked to my Mom today and I guess we've made up now? It sounds like she's gonna let me use her washer and dryer although she didn't actually  say  that to me...  I went to the post office today to mail out some books for bookcrossing and when I was in the post office (where I was overcharged, I might add) and I saw Jenny, this Journalism instructor at SWC and then I saw her at the library where I went to get my Dad because the library is right by the post office...and she apairently lives in the same apartments as my Dad and was telling me about journalism camp this summer, as well as inviting me to journalism camp.  Right now my Dad wants to go to  Sizzler  ick ick ick! I despise sizzler but I think I talked him into going to Cafe la Maz...which is much better then Sizzler and still moderately cheap.  Well - I'm out. Just update on the situation with my evil mother. Excited to go to SWC for my first class. We shall see how it goes.

       The drama with my Mom at home continues. Last Night at about 11 pm she told me to get out of bed and go fold clothes because she wanted to do laundry and my clothes were in there so I said "I'll do it in the morning." She insisted that I do it and I finally was like "Mom, why cant I just do it in the morning" (And I seriously was going to do it in the morning) so there was silence for like...10 minutes or so and then she appeared at my bedroom door and started up with her screaming.  I'm no good, I never do anything she asks me, I'll never amount to anything, she's ashamed to call me her child and other stuff that I can't rember right now. Anyways, to make a long story short she said that I cant do my laundry at home anymore because I didn't want to get out of bed and go do it right when she said and she pointed out that I do this all the time, which is so not true.  Yesterday I had told my Dance teacher about all the drama with my Mom and today she asked me how its going, so I told her about all this and she was like "whoa." But she also said "Hey, I didn't pick my parents either" so I guess she can relate to me in other ways. I still dont know if my Mom is going to pay for dance in the fall. I seriously doubt she will because she is the cheapest person on the face of the earth, but I really hope she will. She only actually has to pay  half  of $65 plus transportation...and that really isn't much for college classes. What would she do if I went to UCSD or something and it was outrageous.  But we had to run in PE today and I took out all my anger with my mother when I ran so I feel a lot better right now and I got a B for my grade which didn't hurt.  I asked my Dance teacher if she could still give my Mom a call to tell her I'm a good dancer with potential and stuff and she said that she would but that on Saturday she is sleeping all day long and on Sunday its her anniversary, so I'm not gonna push it condsidering that.  But someone needs this computer so I'm out.  PS: Saw Michael Rodriguez yesterday and I had to mow the lawn and Mom said if I dont mow the lawn she was going to ground me for two weeks. She can never just...say "Make sure you mow the lawn" she always has to give some threat. But yeah. Bye.

       I went to the dance show last night at school, "Last Chance to Dance" and it was really cool and entertaining. Probably the best dance show I've seen anywhere, as of now. My favorites were "Random Eye Movement" by Lorena Macias and Glorious (Tree63) by Lupita (since she goes to my school and shes a minor I cant put a last name...)'  I want to go back tonight, but I dont see that happening since my Mom and I have been at war literally.  Last Night I had to clear literally  everything  out of my room. Everything off of my dressor this morning, everything off my bed and all thats left in my whole room is a neatly made bed and a dressor thats empty on top...so its going to be really fun putting it all back in there. And my Mom said that shes going to  help  me put everything back in, which means she's really just gonna stand there in my way and supervise...which will probably lead to a fight and I'll end up  getting grounded longer.  Anyways, I'm in class right now and need to get back to working on my Portfolio.  Out-

       Yesterday I have to completely clear out my room so it can be painted today. It was terrible and I went to bed all early because I was so tired from it. I had to completely clear out my closet and I piled all my clothes and boxes of stuff in the guest room, took some of the movable furnature into the living room and then I moved my bed, dressed, computer desk that lacks a computer and my night stand into the middle of the room and made this little area for the painter guy to get around in. And then I also had to clean the walls, remove some adhesive starts from one wall and clean all the closet shelves.  It was quite an ordeal...but in the end I guess I'll have a cool painted room.  We went to Home Depot and got Licorish Stick Red and then white. One wall is going to be bright red and the other ones will be white.  But right now Dad needs the phone line and I need to be off to my Dance thing. So,  Out-

       My Dance piece was ok I guess. I think I was 3rd of 4th best which isn't saying much since most of the people aren't even half way there. But my teacher gave some good advice. She said she liked the on the floor resistance part and I should make my theme "resisting gravity" and she also liked this turn thing I did along with a channe balance that collapses. So I think I'm going to go with more collapsing. I'm gonna work some more and get some advice from Linda.  Out-  PS: I want Chili Fries!!!! Really Really Really BAD! Hopefully when Dad picks me up we can go there!  And then I have to go to this other dance presentation tonight. Should be fun, and much better then the Mexican dancing accompying maraichi which I have passionate loathing for...

       Been thinking lately about my whole college thing coming up. Next week starting Monday I begin my dance class at SWC and then on the 21st I will begin my Psychology class which will then be a whole college load. Should be fun.  But I'm going to have to miss two days of school, or at least a second partial day...so thats going to suck especially in Multimedia because we're doing this final movie project thing and its like important and a group project and two days of missing 6th period will be bad.  One good thing though is that Mrs. Macias, the dance professor said that she is also teaching a night time Jazz Dance class so I would easily be able to make up my absences at night, which rocks.  Right now I need to find out which Psychology Book and workbook I need to get going.  Right now, as a I write this, I sit in my 6th period classroom, after hours with people on the same level as the "space nerds" from  Dude where's my Car . They're all sitting around talking about very wierd things, trying to sound smarter then the others, while playing MTG...I feel like a nature observer in wild territory or something...this is really strange. One guy seems to be normal along with the teacher. The rest though - who knows.  Also talked to my awesome math teacher and I have an A- in her class, but I'm barely holding the grade...so I need to tread softly...  Well - I'm out.

       Tomorrow we have to do a dance presentation to the class and the teacher of what we have so far on the choreography project. It should be interesting. I'm having Linda come over tonight to help me get it ironed out but I haven't heard from her yet so I'm not completely positive that she will be coming. I can only hope.  Also just discovered Upoc.com and its really awesome.

       Last night we were at K-Mart and I was asking my Mom for some shirts and she was losing it telling me that I take care of nothing and therefore deserve nothing. Basically that means I dont kiss her ass so I'm evil and not worthy.  She even made a scene screaming that she's only buying two packs of underwear and one pack of undershirts, which I've needed awhile. But at least I guess I got something out of her. I had to buy these two shirts and a third pack of underwear myself.  After K-Mart, she rushed over to Starbucks on Broadway and H Street to prep some guy on Avon selling and like get him going at Mesa college. I really feel sorry for the guy because he probably thinks shes all nice and professional and the first time she messes up she's gonna be all over him because since he is younger she feels that he is inferior so thus her minion.  At Starbucks she offered to buy me a Tea so I asked if I could apply the $2 a tea would cost into a Frapuchino and she freaked out, accused me of saying a Tea was not good enough and then bought me nothing, which I guess was fair enough, although that was  not  what I said to her...  Anyways, done ranting and raving.

       My Mom had this brilliant idea that we were going to go to Laguna Hills California on this "awesome, fun" vacation experiance for Memorial Day and I would have to say that I was miserable. The whole weekend she insulted me and put me down in every way possible trying to provoke me so she could ground me more... at least that was my perception of it.  She drove all the way to Long Beach on PCM (Pacific Coast Highway) which I guess was pretty at times but she like...was a bitch all the way up there, screaming, nagging and all this other shit that got really old really fast.  She went all over the whole city of Long Beach looking for this Krispy Kream, as if she needs doughnuts. I'm not saying that like I'm all skinny, but I know I dont  need  more carbs or fat...but she like...doesn't get that yet and then says she wants to lots weight...grr!  The first night there, after she screamed at me the whole way there because she got bad directions from Map Quest and it was my fault, as everything else in life is, we checked in and then went to this Resturaunt called Monteray Bay Canners, which has some romantic significance to her because her and my father used to go there in Hawaii.  The resturaunt totally sucked, was very over priced the waitress was terrible. I got some Shrimp that cost her like a mint and some other stuff that was just whatever. I would have rather went to Mimi's Cafe or something. Someplace I already  know  is good, but Noooo!  Then the next day I slept in and she was just as bitchy. Thats when we took that coast drive thing. Well after that when I got on the phone with my Dad she started harassing me so I got off the phone then she hit me or something and I called her a bitch, which is is by the way, figuratively, and then she grounded me more! When will I learn? She is a matriarch, there is no freedom from here, guilty until proven innocent, etc. Sometimes I wonder if she even knows anything about America.  We drove home on Sunday, she hated me even more and let me know it the whole way home and she was like on the phone the whole way home ignoring me and then complaining about my music when she wasn't. I put in all these different CDs trying to find one that she likes. Ones that a month ago she likes now she doesn't because she just wants to disagree with me about something. She had to drive on this costal highway that was totally congested on the way home too, just to make me miserable and make it take longer.  And then when we got to San Onofre she had to pull over onto the state beacuse which is like...nuclear waste and stuff. I think she wants to kill all my little fishies (sperm) by subjecting me to all that crap (I'm serious - its a nuclear waste area - but a nuclear reactor.) We drove around for like 30 minutes so she could find the freeway (I-5) while she kept on commenting about how "this is really creepy" and how she doesn't want to be here. It's like, hello dude, you're the one who freakin' pulled over here!!  One good thing is on the way home we went to this one good Jewis Delicatessan place in Encinitas which totally rocked. I got a Corned Beef Reuban, Mish Mash Soup and ate tons of the pickles on the table which were totally awesome pickles. I'm a pickle person...  Anyways on the way home she went on and on about how ashamed of me she is, how bad of a child I am because I don't kiss her ass and on and on and on. She said from now on I'm to go to straight to my room when I get home at night because I'm so bad and stuff. Then she called my aunt and put on this fake accent to pretend like she actually cares about my aunt. I think she was just bored.  Then she told me because I'm an evil sinner we're going to church, which actually turned out to be somewhat amusing. I wasn't bored out of my mind for a change and actually got something out of it. Whats really sad, though, is that I think the only reason she even went to church was because she had some Avon business with this one lady. She thinks this lady is inferior or something to her so she like was very rude to the lady and like was in her face, right at church. I guess she wasn't kidding when she said shes the same at church as she is anywhere. "She doesn't pretend". I guess thats good. People can see she really  is  a filty bitch.  Well I'm done ranting and raving now. Got it all out.  Today I was doing a lot of reading, sanded my wall, and did laundry. At Dad's now. He leaves alone and seems to at least like me. Although I'm not particularly fond of either of my parents, I would have to say at the moment I like my Dad more. But I have more loyalty to my Mom, even though I sit here and slam her. Its wierd how it works out like that.  Well I'm out-

       Last night I went to a church formal thing at this place called the Catelina Room in Marina Village over in West Mission Bay Drive.  I got my Tux (pictures to come - probably later tonight) and then I drove out there and got there late. But everyone else came even later - the place was really hard to find but I guess we got there after all. I hung out with Jackie, one of my best friends and we took some formal looking pictures and some goofy pictures and then we had our professional pictures taken, sat down and ate some fairly good Italian food. They had Chicken Parmasagne, some pasta, salad, parmasagne garlic bread and lasagne (ick) which was actually pretty good for Lasagne...cuz I dont really like Lasagne.  Well after the eating the youth people did a little skit making fun of the graduating seniors and then we had this dancing thing which was pretty fun but I couldn't really get into any of the music so it wasn't really  that  fun.  Then some chick grabbed me during the Salsa and just kinda steared me around, I had no idea what I was doing and she went to spin me around so I turned with her thinking thats what I was supposed to and we got all tangled up and she gave me a dirty look and then we went on, the spun me off and grabbed some other guy that was as bad if not worse then me at Salsa.  Hip Hop I can do, Jazz I can do, Modern I can do, and even some Ballet I can do, but Salsa is something I cant do...its almost all freestyle based so that makes it really hard.  After that they had this one band come that I guess was like Gospel / R&B that I just couldn't get into. Then they had this mass alter call and turned it into a Christian Factory, as I like to call it, some kind of wierd revival thing. Jackie went storming out with some of the band people following her and like, I dont know what happened, but I think she was just being dramatic.  Right now I'm at MAry Ellen's house on her computer so little Mary Ellen could go see her or something cuz Grandma Mary Ellen and little Mary Ellen (5th grader) haven't seen each other in like forever due to family issues they have with each other and my Mom is like the mediator or something...  Anyways, gotta go. Need to go finish putting my house put back together and fixing up my room.

       Last night my stuff from Amazon.com came so I opened my Pilates and tried it along with the Yoga-latties (which is a mix of pilates and yoga) and tried it and my abs were just too sore to keep it up. It was also somewhat strange that everything about both was centered on breathing...didn't expect that.  I also have my Charlie Bone books and my "Black" by Ted Dekker book.

       Dance yesterday kicked my butt! The teacher increased our crunches from 80 to 140 and wow...I was still sore from the day before and now am sore on top of sore...I dont even want to think about how much she's going to increase the crunches today...  After school yesterday I went to the Tux place and tried on my Tux which I guess fits well? The ladies were busy and didn't really care or look to see if it fits...but its their tux thats gonna be messed up if the pant legs drag on the floor... After that my Dad and I went to this Filapino place and they didn't really have anything fresh, so he didn't want anything, so I just got two chicken empenadas (yumness!!!) and then we went to Weineschitlez (dont know if thats spelled right) and I got like 4 chili dogs and chili chesse fries, which was a little heavy for dance and I almost got a cramp from it.  Then we went to SWC and I went in the book store with my Dad and showed him the book that I'll need for Psychology and asked for this one school t-shirt and he bought it for me. After that we went to the huge library and I talked to one of the circulation guys who prepped me on the usage of all the stuff there such as computers and check outs and such.  After that I went to my dance class where I practically got killed between the dances and all the warm up...but at least I wasn't the only one sore.  I dont feel like going to 3rd Period today so I'm going to get out again.   My Existing Situation:  "Active, but feels that insufficient progress or reward is being made for the effort exerted."   My Stress Source:  "Has an unsatisfied need to ally himself with others whose standards are as high as his own, and to stand out from the herd. This desire for preeminence isolates him and inhibits his readiness to give himself freely. While he wants to surrender and let himself go, he regards this as a weakness which must be resisted. This self-restraint, he feels, will lift him above the rank and file and ensure recognition as a unique and distinctive personality."   My Restrained Characteristics:  "Feels that he is receiving less than his share and that there is no one on who he can rely for sympathy and understanding. Pent-up emotions make him quick to take offense, but he realizes that he has to make the best of things as they are.  Exacting in his emotional demands, especially during moments of intimacy leaving him frustrated in his desire for a perfect union.  Insists that his hopes and ideas are realistic, but need reassurance and encouragement. Egocentric and therefore quick to take offense."   My Desired Objective:  "Feels he has been unjustly and undeservedly treated and betrayed in his hopes. Disgruntled and in revolt against his existing circumstance which he considers an affront."   My Actual Problem:  "The unsatisfied desire to be respected, to stand out from amongst his friends, is causing some anxiety. As a result, normal gregariousness is suppressed and he refuses to allow himself to become involved, or to participate with others in their ordinary activities."   those random results and observations by ColorQuiz.com

       Yesterday was quite Chaotic after school and at school (more about that in mikerbrant.com/personal). But anyways, after school my Mom picked me up and I went straight home, ate and then went straight to SWC to my class. We got there a little early so I walked around a little and then went to the Book Store to buy a bus pass and look at what kind of Psychology Book and such that I'll need for this summer within a few weeks.  I was almost late to class, but made it on time. We started out with all the stretching and warming up technique and then went on to the Jazz Dance and later we did the Hip Hop Dance that Mrs. Macias choreographed here at my school to "Dirt off your Shoulder" by Jay-Z and I really like the song and the dance (to watch) but actually doing it is really hard because its a super super fast dance and like...wierd - so keeping all the movements straight is really hard...  Anyways now I need to be off to class and then get ready to do this crazy routine again tonight.  Out-  PS: Also last night I was in bed at like 9:00 pm because I was all tired and them my Mom's dumb friend showed up with Jackie and Mary Ellen (her daughters) and Jackie's like my best friend so I woulda been fine in bed just in my underwear with her cuz she doesn't really care and I've known her forever, but she brought this one guy from church with her Arcey or something like that (seems like a decent guy) so I had to get up and get dressed. And my Mom was in the bath when they came over so I had to go open the door and stuff and then later she came out of the bathroom and was walking around in a towel with this guy there... I wanted to die. But oh well, I guess everything was covered, that was just wierd...  But yeah - bell rang - really need to go.

       Wow...today was pretty hard. We did pivots and jazz chasses with this sweeping leap thing that was...strange and took me awhile to get down. It looks like this is a Jazz and Hip-Hop class so we're going to do two hip-hop dances and two jazz dances. It looks like the teacher is going to run it much the same as she ran the High School class except this class is strictly jazz and hip hop where the High School class has pretty much every kind of dance involved.  The bus came at exactly 12:10 so I just pretty much stood around for like 45 minutes for nothing...but hey I got there early and was able to scope out the campus. I located the guy's locker room and it was nice and clean. It had three big group showers, 100 or so lockers, a bathroom and benches to change on. I got the prep from this really bored looking guy sitting in the office and they had towels and stuff, so I guess we dont have to bring our own, which is cool.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow starting the Hip Hop dance but also tomorrow I have to go back to real school (High School that is) and then I'm going to have to go to night classes to make up for missing the day class from 5:45-7:50 which is going to suck. My Mom is already bitching about driving me out there. And then next week is really gonna be insanity because I have finals at my school and want to make the daytime class so I'm gonna have to have Lora Sisco come pick me up at school (hopefully be able to get out of class a little early) and then get to Southwestern really fast and hope to get in there on time.  Last night and today I've been working on a new version of my website, TOGZone.com and its finally looking pretty good I guess?  Anyways there isn't much more to write, so I'm gonna be out!

       Today was been pretty cool. I was on touchtone teller with my Bank and apairently they screwed up or something and I have like $50 more then I should have in my savings account so I withdrew like $40 and bought some new shoes at the mall. Then JC Penny was having a really cool sale and I got a bunch of cool clothes that were really cheap. These t-shirts were 4 for $20, $50 pants 2 for $20 and some other cool stuff.  Also we went to the iMax theatre and saw "Forces of Nature" which was pretty cool, but some parts of it were too loud. It was about Volcanos, Earth Quakes and Tornados.  After that we went to Jaliscos in Bonita, really good Mexican food, and I had Chile con Carne and got sick...

It kinda sucks that the Jay-Z CD isn't edited though...it has some really bad language in it that my Mom isn't going to approve of at home and my Dad looked terrified "Don't let the neighbors hear that!" heh. I guess I cant blame him.  Also ordered some new books. Pre-ordered the sequel to Soon by Jerry Jenkins and some others. Still cant get over how cool it is to have Gmail!  Well - off to roleplay.

       Very exciting and action packed from the start, the Chronicles of Riddick kept me entertained through the entire movie but had some very unbelievable if not completely impossible scenes.   Vin Diesal did a very good job portraying his character but it would be nice to see him playing in a movie where he isn’t a hardened criminal or at least a very tough person. In this movie, as in Pitch Black, Fast and the Furious, and XXX he was a criminal who turned out to be a hero in the end.   The movie shows a Sci Fi(sh) cult movement invade planets and convert people to their faith (make them followers) in more sense then one or exterminate them. I really didn’t expect the movie to be about that, but it added to the twist.   Vin Diesal’s character, Riddick goes through some crazy trials including running across a planet that had no atmosphere thus was 700 + degrees Celsius when the sun was shining on it and –200 Celsius when the sun is not shining on it. Well, when the sun was shining he and his girlfriend somehow managed to not melt and escape in a space ship that didn’t melt. Riddick somehow managed to wet his body enough so the heat merely steamed off of him without inflicting tissue damage.   The end was interesting but I wish they would have closed the story. It was very obviously left open for a possible sequel.   In the end this movie was very entertaining and had a lot of interesting special effects, but it defiantly lacked depth.

       Since I saw on Blogger that I can get Gmail because I've been active for sometime or something like that, I've been IMing random people and telling them about it. Thats a REALLY good thing.  In the case you dont know what Gmail is, its an e-mail service through Google where you get 1000 mbs of space and ideally you save every e-mail you ever get, and right now since its still in Beta testing, you can only become a member through invite.  Its really awesome! Its made my whole day.  Also just got back from dinner. Had War Wonton Soup, Pork Lo Mein and a Po-Po Platter. Twas whatever.

       Today was my last day of this school year and it was kinda...boring. But it was cool that I got a 4.0 and it sucked that I had to say bye to several of my teachers that I'm really close to: My English Teacher, my Geometry Teacher and my Biology Teacher.  All the classes were uneventful and we basically just had to sit there for 30 minutes while our teachers wrote out our grades. It sucked to say bye to the forementioned teachers though...cuz they really rock. I wish I could have them next year. My other teachers are neither really good or really bad, just whatever. My PE teacher I will have again next year though...so lets hope that goes good.  At my college yesterday, after I typed my paper for my dance class, I went to Counseling and I got some papers with all the under-grad requirements for a Psychology B.S Major and for a Biology B.S major at both UCSD and UC Davis. I'm thinking of maybe a Psychology B.S with emphasis on Biology.  T'would be interesting to take Psychology as a major with Dance as minor. Psycholgoy can still lead me into Medicine, give or take a few science classes, because both majors require a lot of science and a lot of math.  Time to go get dinner and then sleep sleep sleep.  Out-  PS: Looked at my Psychology Text Book - we're going to take two chapters a week and each chapter is like 40 pages with the Study Guide being about another 40 pages per chapter (give or take) so this should be a really  full  summer.  Reflecting: Had to say goodbye to Martha, Anabel, Tiina, Shavell and some other cool people today. Everyone minus Anabel who is a grade ahead of me is either graduating or moving to other schools, so I'll probably not see them again. I WANT TO TAKE MRS. HERNANDEZ AGAIN NEXT YEAR FOR MATH! ITS NOT FAIR THAT SHE CANT TEACH EXTENDED ALGEBRA!

       Just got out of my dance final. The teacher, surprisingly enough, graded me an A-. She is usually a very critical grader and I've come to the conclusion that no matter how good my dance or anything in her class is, I will never get a full A. It will always be an A-. Oh well...that still counts the same as an A on my transcript.  Last night I got my Psychology WorkBook and TextBook and my parents were both all wierd about paying, but my Mom gave me a check for half...so we should be all good. I also bought a packet of scantrons because the teacher told me we have two quizs per week.  After my class, with Jesette, I took the 709 H-St bound to the Trolley and took the Trolley to Palomar Station and then caught the 701 home...which took me out of my way but still got me home quicker then the 703 would have and I didn't have to hang out at the creepy station. All in all it took me 45 minutes to get home.  Right now its off to my Multimedia Final. That should be somewhat simple. I also found out that I got an A- on the Biology Final (actually it was a low D, but curved with the highest grade which was 38/50, I got 31/38). Also need to find out what my math grade came out to.  Peace

       My Dad is over here freaking out about how he "has nooooooo money" and all this crap. Going on and on and asking me if I want to call the bank's touch tone tellar and affirm that he has no money. Its like he's trying to convince himself that he has no money or something. I really dont...if he says he doesn't have any...must not. But he's like trying to prove it to me, someone who already agrees with him.  I called my Mom and was asking her if she would pay half of the fees for my college text book and she said yeah and then I walked toward my Dad and so he could hear her say "yes" and he got up any walked into the other room *Snort* that was mature...  Then my Mom went on and on about how if she finds a cheaper one outside of the campus bookstore I'm paying her back all the difference. She is too lazy to drive out to the college and give me a ride but I bet almost anything she is going to make a special trip and burn $5 worth the gas to affirm that there is or is not a cheaper book. She'll probably find a book that has a different title thats cheaper then the campus bookstore and tell me I should get (given) book because  it is, after all, a psychology book .  She is the cheapest bastard in the world. Today when I got home from school I went to my bathroom which is attached to her bedroom and I looked on her bed and she had hid the photo paper under a pile of dirty clothes so I dont "steal" the paper from her to print pictures for  her . Whats really sad is I dont /need/ her paper, I have my own, but I would rather use someone else's paper...anywyas its sad. I made sure I moved the paper and half-assed put it back under the clothes so she freaks out and accuses me, so I can tell her to count the pages to make sure I took none, which I'm sure she will do... lol!!  Anyways, now I'm off to school to get my text book. QPB just had an awesome special and I just got a bunch of books I've been wanting super cheap.  Also forgot to say this, yesterday when I was at the bus stop going to SWC these cholos (Mexican Gang Member types) walked up to me and asked if I had any "butt". Because my $30 watch looks expensive and I had my book bag I guess they steryotyped me as a drug dealer and tried to buy "butt" from me (who the hell calls it butt? Its called dope or even better 'weed').  Tonight I'm supposed to take the bus home and get home all late but I'm sure my Mom is going to pick me up and park at SWC to check for cheaper text books! Atleast I dont have to take the bus though. I guess her cheapness is going to pay off after all, atleast in a small way.

       My biology final wasn't that bad today...but something else  is  bad. Actually two things. One, I have a wisdom tooth coming in that hurts like hell and two I have a math final next period that is said to be  very  difficult...so hence I'm not looking forward to it.  Last night I argued with my parents over getting money for my Psych book and my Mom was being a cheap bitch as usaul and said she wasn't going to pay because I dont deserve it and I was the one that wanted to take the class and all this other shit. In the end she said if I bring her a receipt she would pay half, but she has ripped my Dad off in the past and will probably do it again.  Last night our computer got a virus, no doubt from one of my Mother's many forwards or popup mess waiting to happen flash movie sites and somehow she still managed to blame the virus on me. How she can justify that, no idea - but she still did it. I haven't even been on the computer for a month and right when I got ungrounded she grounded me again, so I will probably be on her computer very little from now on, but still I am blamed.  Oh well...such is life.  Also I got a couple copies of blurb today and my Atkins article was published, although they changed the title from "Atkins, Weight Loss or Suicide" to "Atkins, Weight Loss or Health Risk"...far less dramatic...but oh well, I have a by-line.

       Today has been a little chaotic. I was sitting, and still am sitting, in the SWC library on the third floor where the computers are and there was an earthquake. Me and this girl next to me in my row of 6 computers got on the floor and under the desk and this slick looking jock guy just sat there and then when it was over in about 10 seconds he just gave us dirty looks.  Anyways, to this morning. I woke up and then took off to school early. In English I didn't have a final and for some reason the teacher wouldn't let me on the computer to work on my website so I just sat there for an hour until Gilbert was done with his final and then he came back and just kinda ignored me and went with his Drama people that I guess he's working with on his Drama final so I went to my Geography teacher's class for her final and got it out of the way so I could go home and then go to SWC at 10:30.  Just myself and (Geography Teacher's name here) I got to talk to her some and opened up with some stuff to her and she was pretty supportive about the secretive stuff. Also I explained my whole ordeal in middle school to her and she doesn't particularly like the culprit's son anymore then I do. She was telling me that he, everyday just eats his whole Geography period and like does no work. So I guess he is really the loser I thought him to be along with his mother, who is satan.  I finished my final and it was pathetic how easy the teaser questions were. I was telling the teacher some of the questions and she even got a kick out of them. Some of the questions a 1st grader could have gotten right (figuratively).  I left right as my real period started and then this guy who I never particularly liked because he is somewhat annoying and one of those attention seeker class clown types, brought me my off campus pass and seemed to be really decent. I had never really talked to him before. But I guess my opinion changed of him, although he will probably continue to be an attention seeker and even though I'll like him, he'll still be annoying to me.  I also found out that I won this raffle in my English class and that you had to be present to collect your prize and I wasn't...but I think it was only like a pencil or something... What sucks is I never win when I'm present for the prize...and when I do I dont actually get my prize.  I walked home, got ready - my Mom's friend came over and was ringing the door bell and screaming her name - I guess she forgot my Mom works and she wouldn't just go away so I had to hide and be real quiet so she doesn't know I'm there.  I got on the bus, the 701 and took it to where it turns onto H street and then I got on the 709 bus and came to SWC. I went to my Dance class which was really hard but somewhat shorter then the night class so better and it was neat I guess?  Which brings me back to being in the library and the earthquake happening...  Also I've been working on my site, http://togzone.com and I got a Guest Book and an Image Gallery installed which work really cool...  Now I need to head for home. Out-

       Today I went to my Mom's house after school to pick up stuff I need tonight for class and to drop off my stuff from school. Right after I got there she pulled in the drive way, in all honesty, I think she left work early (or actually later then she's /supposed/ to be there) to make sure I take no photo paper. I dont know why the fuck she would leave work for any other reason then that.  Then she proceeded to make me clean up the table and all this other shit she does...and then I was asking her if she was going to give me a ride home from the college and she gave me all this bull and ignored me and then answered me in little riddles.  As I was walking out the door I had two soda (one for myself, one for my Dad) and in her evil bossy voice she commanded me to put the Coke back. I argued the fact with her and said she's really messed up cuz my Dad gives her sodas all the time and she should return the favor and that I was just being nice and she let me take the soda but then she grounded me for a week from the computer. I really dont give a fuck about the fucking computer anymore. She's always grounding me from it anyways, and when I'm ungrounded she doesn't let me on it because she comes up with some shitty reason or chore I need to do before I can go on it and then she's on it doing her Avon.  Anyways, vented that out. Feel better now. But I still hate my Mom and I guess she doesn't get it that she's pushing me further and further away. And whats really funny is I was already grounded from the computer this week because I didn't want to wash her car at 8:30 last night, do a crappy job since I cant see the car and then have to do it again. So I'm doubley grounded from the computer this week...and whats really funny is I can use it at school all I want, minus certain blocked site (most of them I've found a way around though) and then this weekend I'm with my Dad...so I wonder what she thinks she's keeping me from in all honesty.  Anyways - talked to Dad. I think we're going to the fair this weekend. I got a free ticket from the newspaper advisor at my school to go and look at the newspaper judging contest. I think we're going Friday or Saturday. It will be a nice break from school seeing as Friday is out last day and theres no SWC classes on Fridays.  Plus I'll have some money too from grades and such.  Also - some shit head on Hot or Not rated me down and now I'm at a 7. Some people gave me 1s and 2s...I would have to be pitiful to get that low...that was just wrong. I've only ever rated one person a 1 and he was so ugly it made me turn my head...that is soooo wrong that they rated me that.

       Today all hell broke loose in my 4th period class. The teacher was not present so we had this really nice sub that I've had before in another class where the kids behave and they were just cruel to her. She is a little older, probably in her late 60s and she is retired (she used to work here...for 35 years) and they stressed her out so much she looked like she wanted to pull her hair out...  And the class was lame today. Although I was able to talk to Traci about books for awhile so that was cool I guess?  Tonight I have to go to SWC early so I can get my ID made and get some extra work on my Dance. Mrs. Greenway said that I need to connect the movements more and go more with my theme of resisting gravity. Which I guess I will do. And today she was really cool, I take back not liking her - I guess she was so moody and like "bleh" in the first semester due to her pregnancy which would just be  wrong  to hold against her.  Mom was in rare form this weekend today and is a truly evil bitch. But today I'm biting my tongue, being nice and kissing ass because I need a ride home from SWC tonight since I'll probably need Linda to come over to work on "connecting the movements" more on my dance.  Now tis off to Math Class, where it is the last day to cram and go nuts to get all of the final review packet finished.

       Theres this one guy in my Dance class...and man is he creepy. Throughout the whole period he does his own thing. At some point when he comes within a league of doing something even close to what the class is doing - he's delayed like 10 seconds; which leads me to wonder why he is there? And also - am I being cynical and he's actally retarted or something, or is he just super wierd?  Whenever we do any accross-the-floors, he does this wierd turning jazz walk thing...it never fails. And any sideways stuff...he does a forward jazz walk (and a forward jete - if he does  that  much.)  And he walks up to me and asks me really dumb questions. I think he's like...creepy. I try to get away from him and avoid eye contact. Whats even wierder is that he's like...30.  Oh well - I'm gonna feel really bad if he's like retarted or something and I just wrote all this. But lets hope he's not...and just wierd for the sake of my conscience.

       Today was hardcore in dance and in Psychology.  In psychology we had our second quiz (this one girl pointed out that theres only one day a week we dont either have a quiz or exam - scary) and since I studied to some extent this time, I think I aced the test. She came around and told me my score from the Quiz yesterday that I didn't think I did too hot on and I got a 12/15 (which is an 80%) which is bad, but not  too  bad.  (See post in Personal Blog on really hot "person" in Psych Class  urlLink Click Here )  In psychology right after the quiz she had us take another load of notes and then do some test strategizing (not looking forward to the test covering chapter 1 - I dont get chapter 1) and wow was it a lot. She let us out early again, so I guess we're going to get out at that time everyday.  Then in dance I think we had the hardest day so far (And I've been saying that all week - so what does monday have to bring? Scary Thought) and this was easily the hardest week of my life between the dance class and the Psychology class. Today was our mid-term for dance and she gave us a hardcore warm up and ab-killers before we were video-recorded and had to perform the test (I think I got an "A" which is good.)  She also let us out of class early - and I was going to type up this psychology paper but I got ahold of my Mom and she came and picked me up (Saved!) so I didn't have to take the bus home and be against a bunch of sweaty people with no air to breathe (ick) piled in like sardines.  She drove me home - I immediatly made hamburgers and garden burgers (I was sooo starving after the dance final - I should start eating Lunch) and then loaded them with veggies and ate two and a little chili (then I was ready to explode) and then I went to take a nap and digest and I just woke up, which brings me to this post, and the really hot person in my psychology class *drools*.  Now I need to go mow the lawn and then do HMWK - and apairently we're going to Phoenix tomorrow (no idea why) and just chillin in our condo place (Mom has a time-share) and like relaxing I guess? Whatever - relaxing is gonna be real nice after this week. I can catch up on my reading and study for my test *shudder*.  Off to the lawn then my paper.

       Lately as much as the dance class has been killing my muscles, I've noticed definate results from it, in the weight loss and tone-up department.  I dont know that I've lost 'pounds' per se, but I'm definatly noticing my fat toning up to muscle, particularly in my upper thighs, my lower calves and my stomach. When I was looking in the mirror standing up yesterday (was naked since I was about to take a shower) I noticed that my stomach (the fat anyways) is almost completely gone from the crazy crunches Mrs. Macias has been giving us - and my upper thighs are getting rock hard rather then that yucky flabby mess. The next thing I need to work on once this class is over is Cardio and upper body strength. Upper body strength is something I totally lack.  What sucks is that when I'm sitting down and my stomach is all crammed together, there is still quite a bit of fat, but standing up the muscles stretch it out, and I look almost skinny. I still want to lose about 40 pounds though...even if I'm toning up, I dont want to weigh 235.  Peace-

       Ok - ranting and raving, not that interesting of a post, so not important to read.  Last night I was on the computer, happily, in our computer room, working on my website and my Mom called me, like she does every 5-10 seconds to do something she can easily do herself. This time she called me clear in the other room to turn on her tv that is on top of the refridgerator, where another tv was on in the next room, which she could see from the kitchen (I tell you she is obsessed) so when she told me to turn on the Tv on top of the refridgerator (which I might add she wouldn't be able to see while she cleans the kitchen or whatever she was doing any easier then the one in the family room) and I rolled my eyes just because it sounded stupid to me. When I rolled my eyes I happened to be twisted TURNING ON HER DAMN TV and she slapped the hell out of my face because I think her wanting to have every TV in the house on is dumb and I slapped the crap out of her too out of reflexes...if you're twisted around and someone slaps you, its an involuntary reflex to slap them back or just twitch...and my arm happened to whip around. I actually think it was pretty cool that I slapped her unvoluntarily and didn't get in trouble - which was a shock.  Well she started bitching about how it was all disrespectful to roll my eyes at her and that is an an adult and can do "whatever the fuck she wants in her house" and that I better never say anything about her TV habit again (so she knows she is obsessed and has a problem and gets all touchy when I hint at it!) What really sucks about all this is that she totally over-reacted. I roll my eyes all the time, not like its something directed at her, its a natural thing I just do...and if she would have been asked something that ridiculous she would have rolled her eyes too (maybe /that/ wasn't ridiculous to her - but something that would be.)  What really pisses me off is that she called me  clear  from the other room to do that when she could have easily done it herself. Everyday I hate TV more and more because I swear thats all she fucking does anymore. And when I want to go on the computer she wont leave me alone. She made some comment about how I'm back there ignoring her (but what is she doing watching TV? Socializing with me?) yet whenever I'm in the room when she's watching TV and I say something she huffs and puffs and get all pissed that I  dare  interrupt her precious show and she tells me to ask her during commercials, but since she records every channel that there is, there are about 10 seconds of commercials because she just fast forwards through them. GRR!  Everytime I'm on the computer, I swear she finds a fucking reason to kick me off! I cant even do homework on the computer in peace (yet she wants peace to watch TV). It really sucks. Last night I was not on the computer 5 minutes and then she came in and kicked me off to use it (and check her e-mail) for  a second  (which lasted more like an hour) to spam up her contacts' inboxs with her shitty virus containing forwards. Even more ironically last night she had two virus containing e-mails and somehow managed to blame our last three viruses on me (when I hadn't even been on the computer in like 2 months). Then right after I actually got the computer back she called me to  turn on  her  tv  (because she is an adult who can do whatever the fuck she pleases!)  I think the next time I get grounded from the computer long term (she threatoned six months at three different points last night) I'm going to get even. I'm going to go around and move her remotes some her various TVs and more them from where they should be, but have them where they're not hidden either (she doesn't like changed from her daily routine and doesn't know how to look for things, yet tells me constantly "Its not gonna jump out and say 'here I am'") so she has to get up off her sorry ass and look for something herself or just not watch TV (better yet.)  In some ways my Mom drives me so crazy its not even funny.  But right now I need to get to another post and then to class.  Peace-

       Today in Dance was probably the most packed and hardest day we've ever had in there. The teacher killed us...  And on the hip hop dance she changed the beginning part to the break dancing so it took me awhile to get that down.  Psychology wasn't that bad. She even let us out 15 minutes early. If it stays at this pace it wont be near as bad as it supposedly is going to be since its only a six week course.  Now off to my psychology HMWK.

       Today I started out on Psych 101 and it was interesting. We did the whole introduction to the couse thingie and then went in to the psychological motivators behind 9/11. Then the class ended and I went on to dance where the teacher worked us like there is no tomorrow. But I can feel myself getting stronger and toning up and I went to this church's office (that I used to go to) to say hi to this one guy, Gabe, that I like really love (in a brotherly way) and he wasn't there so I had to talk to this guy where there is mutual dislike and he was acting all political like he actually liked me *gag* and then went and talked to Christian, who isn't on the same level as Gabe, but is still a really cool guy, gave him the update and then went and talked to the office ladies who I get the impression dont like me either, but they're still much more discrete about it then the other guy. If someone doesn't like me, it pisses me off when they pretend they do...just tell me you dont like me, dont pretend you do and be nice to me, and we'll be cooler with each other. I can take that - you wont get along with everyone in life.  Anyways - was giving my Dad and my Mom my little commentary on religion and our origin. They dont agree but I thought I'd post it here just in case it changes so I can look back someday.   On Prayer/Meditation I believe that prayer, though it is talking to God, is not some magic method where God goes "poof" and whatever you pray for appears. The reason I feel is doesn't work that way is many people from many different religions pray to different deitys and they're prayers (in their opinion) are answered and then people who have no deity and just meditate still find solutions to their problems - which leads me to the conclusion (I heard this from someone else, so its not origional - but it is customized) that when we pray or meditate, through focused energy it brings us to a higer state of consciousness and we're able to think clearer and solve our own problems.   On Religion Vs. Science Thought I believe in the God of the Christian/Jews/Muslims (One in the same) I dont believe word for word about the origin of the earth and I also believe Religion and Science can work together. I think God did indeed spark off the whole big bang creation thing, and he guided it, but I think he let it run its own course. Since the earth is said to be somewhere around 7 billion years old and the universe way older then that, I think that each "day" of his creation cycle symbolized somewhere around a billion years. So the creation of animals, he evolved them over that billion or so years and then stopped them there and went on to the next cycle. I know that is conflicting, but it makes sense for me. I used to be brainwashed into not believing in evolution at all, but agiain, there is too much evidence for it. In the end of the cycle, I believe God stopped macro evolution and then thats when natural selection and micro-evolution (adapation) came into the picture. I believe God used Evolution to create the earth, set it up so he doesn't have to intervene and then just lets it run its course.    On Micro Evolution Next would be micro evolution and natural selection. I believe those are both very active today, and most narrowminded Christians that are actually informed and make some of their own opinions cant even deny that. Survival of the Fittest is in every species and ecosystem and things do adapt over time and evolve over time on a small scale. Maybe over a couple hundred years the size of a bird's beak changes to accomidate a new food source or the color of a community of rabbit's coats changes to better blend in. I do not believe that macro evolution (one species changing into another) happens anymore and if it does still happening, its very gradual and no one will ever live long enough to observe it happening - so why worry about such things?  On a more Christian scale I think that people believing God *poof* gives them what they pray for, in example of someone hanging money to someone who is in need, is purely coincidence but then yet I believe in spiritual warefare too, so some of my opinions conflict.  As for an afterlife (Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, Summerland, etc) I dont know what I believe. The bible seems to me to be a corrupted book that started out good and went bad. Anything written by man is corrupted because man is biased and they put their own opinions in there. As much as someone asys "It was inspired by God" that doesn't necessarily mean the men  listened  to God. And provided they did, the various translaters who switched the bible from Armanic to English and various other languages (even Latin) put their biases in there and changed it around. So how accurate is the bible to its origional context? But then who am I to say its corrupted too? I dont know that for sure.  Again - these are purely opinion - which is somewhat scary since I'm the Christian Club President at my school, but maybe God is using my opinions to truly inform people? A lot of the stuff in the bible can still be accurate, but tahts also leaving room for some stuff being corrupted. What you have to do to be "enlightened" and go to heaven is a little farfetched and hardcore. If you really have to do all that stuff (die to yourself, sell all your stuff - give the money to the poor and follow God, etc) then very few people are actually going to heaven.  This is all for now.

       Just reflecting I remember when I was a little kid and I used to buy little kiddie shaving kits and be all excited about having facial hair and having to shave...now that I have it - it really sucks. When I only had to shave like every week or so it wasn't bad, but pretty soon (probably within a month) my facial hair will be growing so much that I'll probably have to shave like every day.  On second note, start Psychology 101 today - should be interesting. Two hours of note taking then a kick ass dance class. I'll probably be about to drop dead when its all over - then staying up till like 1:00 doesn't help either...  Out-

       I was just in a meeting on this Harry Potter themed text based RPG (Moo) that I play on and we were having a meeting about what will happen if Magic stops working altogether and the damn admin guy pretty much dismissed  everything  that I contributed to possible things that would happen.  It really sucked. I mean, I already dont like him, but now I dislike him even more. If my ideas sucked, he could have at least been polite about it. He was just like "No"...what kind of politically correct admin is like that.  Anyways, on further, got in an argument with my Dad about how Strogonoff and Mashed Potatos done go together...and he got all pissed, got all offended and said then dont eat them *rolls eyes*. He doesn't get the concept that primarily Carb meal isn't the way to go. Noodles and Mashed Potatoes...carb heaven - but still just wrong.  He was freaking out about how I need to help around the house so I vacuumed and cleaned down the bikes and watered the plants! Go me! Then we got in another argument about how he wanted me to give my bike away and I told him that Chula Vista has very few flat surfaces to ride bikes and most people I dont know wouldn't have ridden them anyways so he got all pissed about that and just blabbed on about it for like 30 minutes. I just tuned him out and nodded at the appropriate times.  Mom came over and brought my dance shoes, which was really decent, and then I talked to her for awhile. This is like the first time in a long I would rather be with my Mom then over here...but oh well - not gonna happen.

       Tonight about 1:20 my Dad got up and went pee and then I heard him just like gaging his head off. He was spitting up this crap for like a good 15 minutes and then I asked him if he was ok and he said it was just indigestion.  Whats really scary is I think its from him being an alcoholic since he was like 16. He's probably eated away at most of his asophagus and stomach and intestines so they can't take anymore alcohol so it causes him to puke up crap. Next will probably be heart, liver and kidney issues. The body isn't made to take that much alcohol...but I guess its his body...he has to live with it if he messes it up.  What sucks for me is that my Dad's family has super addictive tendancies for a lot of stuff and I'm gonna have to be really careful as an adult or I'll probably end up being an alcoholic just like him because of the addictive personality I already have with some stuff. I mean, when I find something cool, organizations, people who show me attention, etc I like obsess over whatever for up to a month and then like it climaxes out and I find a new obsession...and if I'm doing that now what am I going to do the first time I'm offered drugs or alcohol and are stupid enough to accept out of peer pressure? Scary thought..  Anyway - its late, I'm off to bed.  PS: The Rock Steady and Diary of Alicia Keys CDs are both really good. The Jay-Z: Black Album one is vulgar and I wish I could have just got that one song rather then the whole CD and saved my money...oh well.

       Today has been fun I guess.  My Dad and I went to the fair today and right when we went in we went over to the Student Showcase where they had the High School Newspapers and I saw the paper from my school (it was the one that had  none  of my articles in it…) and then my Dad was moping around and looking at all this crap in the wood workers area *sigh* and it took me forever to get him to leave that area and get over the rides.  He gave me $30 which as really nice – it should get me outta debt and then I can pay off my books. He bought me $20 worth the ride tickets, which was 6 rides and then I went on all sorts of their crazy rides – however I didn’t get to go on the zipper. I wanted to go on the zipper but my Dad didn’t and they don’t allow single riders to go on it and I was alone.  After going on all the rides we went and got some Australian batter fried potatoes, I got ranch and my Dad got cheese – and they were crazy big orders. We could have split an order and probably not eaten all of them. After we were leaving the area where we ate, we went by this area where this guy forcefully put us into seats where we got $12 – 10 minute long full body massages. He did a really good job, although he was pretty rough at first on my shoulders and I had to ask him to be gentle. A couple of times he got a little too far down…  After the massage I went and did the climbing wall thing – and because the 18 year oldish skater dude attendant guy was hitting on me (he wasn’t bad looking himself) I got to climb the wall 4 times instead of just one for my $5 – so it wasn’t a bad deal all in all.  During my 4th time up there was this chick that was scared to repel, climbing down the call and causing a traffic jam, so I was just standing there holding on to the wall and when I finally got down, my hands and fingers and forearms were killing me (and still are – my fingers are randomly cramping up.) Well the hot guy who was hitting on me – offered for me to go up the fall a fifth time (am I that hot?) but I had to decline cuz my fingers hurt.  Then after that we went to the exhibit halls and I found an ear piercing place – so I decided because they were cheap I wanted to get my left ear pierced so I did – it didn’t hurt at all since she used a gun thing (I did flinch though – just nerves) and now I have a pierced ear that doesn’t look to bad.  I wanted to get my eyebrow pierced too, but she said they only do ears – so I guess that will be another time and another place.  Before we went to the fair, my Dad took me to my Mom’s to pick up the mail and these super lazy – stupid stoner neighbors of ours’ kids were actually working. Their mother has to beg and plead for them to even take out the trash and the one skinny stoner dude (he constantly wears this weird cap thingie around) acts like its super hard and kills him to move the trash cans all of 10 feet from the side of their house to the curb… Anyways – he and his stoner brother were cleaning their yard (wow! Hard work) and removing these ugly railroad ties that the last loser neighbors put in there. Who could have guessed…  Anyways – now I sit here – tired and yeah.  Peace out for now.

       Question:  Suppose that a new "miracle pill" is developed that will allow a person to function with only one hour of sleep per night. However, because a night's sleep is so short, a person who takes the pill will never dream again. Knowing what you do about the functions of sleep and dreaming, what would be some advantage and drawbacks of such a pill from a personal standpoint? Would you take such a pill?   My Responce:  REM (Random Eye Movement), a cycle during which sleep takes place, is a major portion of our nightly sleep cycle and gives our brain the ability to rest and manifest random pictures (dreams) because it becomes stimulated by random neurons.  Theoretically, the body requires a certain amount of REM sleep per night to function properly. Subjects taking part in sleep studies, when awoken during a dream, spent significantly more time in REM sleep when they fell back to sleep, making up for the time lost when they were awoken to record their dream – showing that humans do in fact require a certain amount of REM sleep.  So – to function properly, humans requiring a certain amount of sleep per night, is a given. If deprived of that sleep they will be able to live their lives normally, but they will be snappy and irritable because their brain isn’t rested, even though they themselves may feel rested.  According to the Dreams-for-Survival Theory, “…dreams represent concerns about our daily lives, illustrating our uncertainties, indecisions, ideas and desires. Dreams are seen, then, as consistent with everyday living. Rather than being disguised wishes as Freud suggested, they would represent key concerns growing out of our daily experiences (“Essentials of Understanding Psychology” page 123)  The text goes on to say, “Dreams permit information that is critical for our daily survival to be reconsidered and reprocessed during sleep.” (“Essentials of Understanding Psychology” page 122)  So, if a miracle pill were invented, under the influence of which we would have to only sleep one hour a night, it would cause major problems for humans. Yes – they would have much more time on their hands to do the many tasks in their life which they don’t have time for – but they would be snappy to their colleagues, they wouldn’t be able to “permit information that is critical for our daily survival to be reconsidered and reprocessed during sleep” and their body would be constantly asking for more REM (as seen in studies of victims awoken during REM.)  Due to the above stated issues, I would personally not take any kind of miracle pill that made it so I didn’t have to sleep. Though I would have more time on my hands, I wouldn’t feel as rested as I do with 6 or more hours of sleep (including REM, of course) and my life probably wouldn’t be as fulfilling. My senses would probably also be somewhat numb after awhile. Plus dreams, in a lot of cases are interesting – especially when they are erotic dreams.

       Question:  If the eye were constructed with a second lens that "unreversed" the image hitting the retina, do you think there would be changes in the way people perceive the world?   My Responce:  The human eye, seeing things upside down, yet the brain reversing the image and letting us see it right side up is a very interesting human ability. According to the book we do actually see things upside down and the brain turns them right side up, however, our bodies do not work like a microscope in that there is not a second lens that turns seen images right side up – we have adapted to do it ourselves.  If for some reason our bodies were to change or evolve where we acquired a second lens that turned everything we see un-reversed, there could be two outcomes. One – our bodies would see everything upside down, like the researcher who wore the glasses in England where she saw everything upside down, then after a certain amount of time our bodies would get used to the upside down image and be able to function normally, seeing the world upside down, thus we would just learn to live with the world upside down, and after awhile would know no significant difference.  Or – a second outcome – our brain over time would turn things back reversed so our body functioned as it did before; although a much more possible outcome would be that the function of the brain associated with un-reversing all of our vision would simply become obsolete because it wouldn’t be needed to reverse the images anymore –therefore the second lens would ultimately perform that function for the brain and the brain would no longer deal with the turning/reversal of images.

       In Psychology we've been studying the states of consciousness and stages of sleep and its been really interesting. I think I've retained almost all of it just because its so interesting. The laws and theories of organization (Gestalt) have been throwing me off though, so I'm going to have to get those down by Tuesday. (Monday is going to be the cram and study my ass off day for the exam Tuesday.) Thats the main thing that sucks about college - the prof's dont want to be grading a bunch of writing assignments you can BS your way through - so they make most of your grade tests on scan-trons to make things easy for them, and that sucks for me because I'm not the best tester in the world...  I've been dropping a lot of weight, or at least toning up the weight I do have but to get rid of the love-handles and excess fat Mrs. Macias has told me I have to start running  YUCK!  so I guess I will start running, but I swear I look like a girl when I run, so I need to find a place to do it where people wont see me - maybe the track at my High School after-hours or the track at the college after dance (provided there are no classes using it) so I can get completely in shape by the start of High School.  Unfortunatly dance is only going to continue for two more weeks and then I'll have to be self-motivated until school starts back in the fall (Modern Dance then and then High School PE - with timed running)  YUCK!  So I'm going to do Pilates and then go somewhere and run on my own (Maybe do something active with my Mom - run while she bike rides so she can get some kind of health benefit from the deal) then then, like I said, continue the toning and dance supplement by doing MTV Pilates when dance is over.  I hope I come out of school with a really good grade in both classes so I can continue on with cool classes and get a lot of college out of the way before I actually enter college - so I can take a whole load of the biology classes I wanna take.  Right now I need to get on with my Psych writing assignments and then get ready for bed because we're going to the fair tomorrow.  Peace Love and Golden Oreos!

       Lately I've been considering just testing out of High School and going to college full time because it comes pretty easy to me, I like it more because we have a lot of freedoms in Collge (as adults rather then children) and its just all the more laid back. The people there want to be there, they dont have to be there, most of them care because they're paying to be taught where High School their parents pay, etc.  And as easy as I could just go test out of High School, get a GED and go to SWC full time (and get completely done in my early 20s) I would be ineligable for most scholarships, have to pay for super expensive student loans and there would constantly be a war with both of my parents over whose paying this and whose paying that and I would probably eventually get to the point where neither would or could pay anymore, and I would just be sitting there not going to school - working full time at a going-no-where job or be just spending like crazy and piling up my loans fees.  So I guess in the end I'm staying in High School, or at least to my junior year. That would be at least one more year, probably two.  Whats really great is that I have an "A" in Psychology right now (right at 90% average) and I probably have an "A" or "B" in Dance, which is good considering I'm barely a sophomore and I can successfully do great in high school classes.  Without the encouragement from Mrs. Hernandez, Mrs. Murphy and Mrs. Macias I totally wouldn't be here right now though. Without Mrs. Macias being a true inspiration in dance at CPH I would have had no reason at all to take any form of college classes, be at home being lazy the whole summer or working my ass off doing chores my Mom wants done which sucks. Thats how I spent summers before last year. Last year I had a break - I was at Cornerstone everyday of the week, but look where that got me now... (see two posts down from here for more information)  Peace-

       To start, its really sad to me this is how things have turned out. I used to go to Cornerstone and be really happy there - then they found out I had some issues that I was seeking help with, and I was removed from every "ministry" I was involved in and then the little "sinner" whom they "wanted to help" but never actually initiated that process.  Recently for some reason, several of the people that I totally love from Cornerstone haven't been responding to anything - email, instant messaging, they're "not there" if I call - etc, which is getting pretty obvious - so I guess since I left now I'm the "evil evil sinner"?  I have really good reasons for leaving - the Pastor turned Hollywood and was there more for his TV camera then his congregation, that whole getting kicked out of everything and the youth leader guy is another reason. He screams and gets all mean looking when he preaches, his messages are very fundamentalist right-wing messages where he doesn't even icknoledge that maybe another side exists (IE: Brainwashing) and he told me I'm going to hell for watching MTV (and since I watch it whenever I can, I guess going to hell really really now?)   7/2/2004		  1:14:40 PM Michael Brant: sup   1:23:04 PM Michael Brant: I have samplers of "Something Like Silas" from EMI Record Group - if you'd like one for the purpose of XSCAPE along with little sticker thingies for the new Chris Rice Album coming out, it would be bad to continue ignoring me...   1:23:17 PM Michael Brant: if you want them...   1:23:25 PM Michael Brant: and assuming you do, where do I mail them to?   1:23:45 PM Gabe: yeah dude that would be sick   Notice that he doesn't answer me until he knows that he has something coming (A free CD sampler thing)   7/2/2004  1:44:25 Michael Brant: whose preaching (or whatever its called) tonight?   1:45:06 PM Gabe: Richard   1:45:24 PM Michael Brant: is he preaching next week too?   1:45:35 PM Gabe: no miggy is preaching next week   1:45:54 PM Michael Brant: well...I'm certainly not gonna be here this week if Richard is preaching.   1:45:57 PM Michael Brant: maybe next week?   1:46:07 PM Michael Brant: trying to get Beth to go - cuz I dont wanna go alone   1:46:13 PM Gabe: whats up with that dude   1:46:19 PM Gabe: you dont like rich   1:46:22 PM Gabe: ?   1:46:29 PM Michael Brant: I didn't say that   1:46:35 PM Michael Brant: I just think he gets a little overboard   1:46:46 PM Michael Brant: and is very one-sided on all of his messages   1:46:52 PM G: he just tells it like it is   1:46:55 PM Michael Brant: he doesn't allow the possibility for anything else   1:47:06 PM Gabe: give him a chance   1:47:12 PM Michael Brant: actually - he tells it how someone else says it is   1:47:17 PM Michael Brant: most of those aren't his own opinions   1:47:24 PM Gabe: what do you mean   1:47:31 PM Michael Brant: and when he said all the people who watch MTV are going to hell - that kinda was it for me   1:47:42 PM Michael Brant: I mean - that most of his sermons he gets from somewhere else   1:47:49 PM Michael Brant: so those aren't his opinions   1:47:53 PM Gabe:  he never said that   1:47:57 PM Michael Brant: he's just re-iterating someone else's opinions   1:47:59 PM Gabe: or meant it the way you took it   1:48:03 PM Michael Brant: he did say that - at Sunday school at XSCAPE   1:48:09 PM Michael Brant:  err...   1:48:18 PM Michael Brant: when we were at Hilltop   1:48:20 PM Gabe: but he didnt mean it like that   1:48:21 PM Michael Brant: in that one classroom   1:48:25 PM Michael Brant: thats what he said...   1:48:29 PM Michael Brant: not even like I perceived it wrong   1:48:41 PM Michael Brant: "If you watch MTV - you're not really a christian"   1:48:44 PM Michael Brant: or something to that effect   Here's the whole MTV incident.   7/2/2004 		 1:49:02 PM Gabe: well hopefully ill see you tonight man i gotta get some stuff done   1:49:13 PM Michael Brant: you wont see me tonight - but bye   1:49:21 PM Gabe: alright see you later   At the end, when he knows I'm right and theres nothing he can do to sway me, he turns it around like nothing happens, we're all happy Christians out of the Cornerstone "Christian Factory" (Inside thing - read the book The Visitation by Frank Peretti) and I'm still going to be happy too and go tonight - to a church I dont like - to listen to a guy who preaches super right-handed messages he gets from some website - ignorant to all the things that he denies (a lot like my Mom actually - when it comes to his opinions - he seems to me, to not form his own)

       I took a nap from like 6 - 9 cuz I was super tired and since I got up my Mom has been a naggy fuck. I swear: When I first got up, after I took a nap because she was going to "borrow" the computer from me for a short time - three hours later, before she would give it back to me for studying (I swear she takes it away from me whenever I'm on it for her damn Avon) she made me vacuum and "do something around the house" cuz I haven't done anything for 'months' before she'd let me back on!  Now shes walking around the house randomly screaming stuff at me, randomly telling me things to do and randomly accusing me of stuff. Right now she said I put two loads in the washer and if I ever do it again she wont let me use the washer anymore and I'll have to just wear my clothes dirty (she's done this in the past, so I dont think she's kidding) and her washer is a "double capacity" so I did  not  overload it.  Right now I'm overly pissed.  And I just found out this person I have a mad crush on will never work out...which makes me sad. Cuz they dont feel the same way about me. *frown*  Talked to my dance teacher today about some stuff, she's apairently a more laid back super smart person too - she told me she was taking college classes at the same age as me, that she took AP classes and all that and she had some curious recomendations. She suggested that I just take AP classes to get the weighted GPA, but not worry about the tests because they're dumb, and you have a "chace" of passing or failing the test and not getting the credit. She said in college you actually have something to show for your efforts, like selling your text book back, etc - and that a semester is equivelant to what a year in high school gives you, meeting twice a week rather then everyday. So that sounds better to me.  Tonight we went to Costco where my Mom FINALLY bought some ink cartrages (shes too cheap to buy ones for the *REAL* Dell Printer - so she settled with ones for the crappy Epson printer) and I was looking at books - thinking of the ones I'd like to buy and I found out that I'm broke (underdrawn) and my Dad is going to (figuratively) kill me when/if he finds out, so I need to get my financial dealings under control (use self-control) so this doesn't keep happening.  We went to Lolitas for dinner and got the #1 (Two Tacos, Beans, Rice) and I still am really surprised how something so simple is the best thing, in my opinion, that they have there. I used to get all this wierd fancy, expensive stuff and now I found my favorite thing (Although I think I'm getting Carne Asada Fries next time - I'm due for Carb Overload.)  Well - off to studying.

       Today has been a crazily busy and full day.  I started in Psychology with taking a bunch of notes on the eyes/brain relations and how they work together and then being confused for a long time. I still dont get it now, so tonight I'm going to read the text, try to make sense of it and then hope to do good on my quiz tomorrow. Right now my standing grade in the class is an 89%, after my exam which I scored 89% on. The teacher said she would give us 25 points free if we go see Farenheit 9/11 and show her a ticket stub, so even though thats a dumb biased political propaganda movie, I still think I may go see it becuase 25 points is 25 points.  http://www.togzone.com/nuke/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=46&mode=&order=0&thold=0 is a review on the movie from TogZone.com (My website), be sure to check it out, rate it and then leave comments.  Dance we continued our chair dance to Usher (Im not too big on him) and she worked our asses off. I'm sore all over - and will probably take a bubble bath to relax my muscles tonight. As much as I love the teacher, Mrs. Macias and the class, I honestly cant wait until its over in 2 1/2 weeks because its such a load.   urlLink Personal Blog  has been updated.  Out-

       This weekend I went to Phoenix Arizona, which, this being summer, was 107 or higher everyday - and amazingly I enjoyed the heat - just sun bathing in the pool area of our 4 star resort, The Legacy Golf Resort outside of Phoenix Arizona.  The first day we were there, we had gotten there around 10 (left home at 4:30 am!!) my Mom called her cousin, Cathy and later at night they came to our resort and took us to dinner. What really sucked about the dinner, is my Mom didn't know they were going to pay and we ordered this dish that was pretty expensive (and nasty) then we were all like "oh shit!" when it was time to go cuz they caught the bill, then my Mom offered to pay the tip and didn't put enough, realised it later, and was even more put out.  The resturaunt was a very western steak place equipped with a Bull, a slide down from the bar to the dining area (piled with little kids) and some awesome bread and salad (bread rocked, BBQ sucked) and they had this cool cinnamon butter junk to go on the indian flat bread and on the biscuits which just made the dinner complete.  During dinner I asked my Mother's cousin what she does for a living and she told me she used to work for Sprint as a lead over several states until she was layed off and now she is a median, she communicates with the dead, she goes into people's previous lives and removes negitive energy, she clears the constructed areas within people's energy meridians, she does accu-pressure and she does transcendual meditation. She went on to explain how she communicates with spirit guides and "descended master" (fancy name for a Demon...) and it really creeped me out. When she went on to say that she "communicates wth the dead" her voice even changed - it went down an octave. So as much as I dont really want to do the God thing anymore, I still totally believe God exists and Jesus and the whole bible thing, and definatly demons and angels - so it was really wierd. (Back to my beliefs - I just have a lot of conflicting beliefs about doctrine and stupid people within the church)  Anyways, after our dinner thingie we went back to the hotel and just chilled and then went to Bed.  Saturday for the most part was uneventful. We rented a car, got to take a really fancy car to the rental car place (free of charge) and then we got this piece-of-shit car that the Air Conditioner barely worked and then went to the grocery store and bought some junk along with somewhat good food and then went back to the room, took a nap, chilled, Mom cooked - etc. Then that night we went to the pool, chilled by the pool, got and then we went to the bar and got some Nachos and Pina Coladas (I bet they woulda sold me alcohol if I woulda tried since I look old, but I didn't want to chance getting arrested or my Mom finding out and me getting in big trouble with her - so I didn't try it - just went with virgin Pina Coladas - which are still good)  Also on Saturday we went to this mall and saw Stepford Wives and ate some Nathans Hot Dogs. Also I went to the Virgin Megacenter place and bought a book (wanted to buy a load of CDs too) and then thought I shouldn't have bought the book cuz I'm broke so I had my Mom take it back and play along with me about how I shouldn't have bought the book and she's all disappointed and I'm in big trouble and she was able to get my money back...which was good.  After that we went to a 99 cent store where I found some great books super cheap and got them for a buck each. Then we went back to the resort and did the above explained pool vs. bar thing.  The next day we went to my Mom's cousin's house in this rich-snobish part of Phoenix and went in the pool and then she cooked for us and we had a truly awesome lunch. I sat around her pool and read my book "Watership Down". I could have been playing with her kids, but they're 6 and 10 and totally not my age and that would have been strange, so I just read. At one point they did come join me in the pool and we played some in-water basketball. The 10 year old caught the rebounds for me and the 6 year old was my cherring comitte. After that we had these huge juicy pork chops, brownie w/ ice cream, twice baked potatos, etc and it rocked.  Then after that we drove 30 minutes or so back to our room and this guy Brian Agosto, an awesome guy that I grew up with way back when, came with his wife to visit us and we got to catch up with him and find out how his life is doing now and all that. Most of his conversation was about his older brother and a lot of religious stuff with he and my Mom so I didn't really get to talk to him much, but he is still really awesome. As kids his little brother and I were best friends and used to always be together, but I dont really remember his little brother much because they moved away when I was like...8 or 9. But we did, all-in-all have tons of fun together way back when, I just forget the details. Anyways- Brian is 21 now, getting formally wed in September with his wife (they had one of the "you're legally married now says the state" kind of weddings and then are having the wedding with all the family and stuff in September.)  I remembered Brian as a really religious dude, super involved in church and stuff when we were kids and now its really awesome to see him way more laid back and stuff. He even cussed a couple of times, talked about be careful you dont sleep around in Brasil because people have a lot of STDs...etc - so that was awesome to hear/see.  They took off around 11, we went to bed and then got up at like 7 to get all packed up and stuff and then take our flight home. At the airport there were these two super ugly dudes that seriously looked like terrorists and had me a little scared at one point but our flight was fine and then we got home and got a ride with Lora and then dropped off my stuff at school, grabbed my school stuff and jumped in the car.  I barely got to my Psych class on time, but got there, and then we took a test (dont know how hot I did on it - had to do a bit of quessing on some of the outside-of-the-box answers) and then now here I am.  Exciting weekend huh?  Out-

       Well, tonight I went back to Xscape after about...6 months and it was a surprise from the beginning.  To start I was talking to Linda, who couldn't get me a ride, so she said she would call Gabe to get me a ride, who called Chris Wong to get me a ride who called Linda and suggested Joel to give me a ride. So in the end Joel picked me up, which was a big surprise but was cool.  Joel seems a lot less on fire then he was in the past - but you cant judge a book by its cover - so I dont know that. But he was talking about girls, political movies, etc - he didn't have that whole "everything is about God and conservativeness" attitude that I remember him having. But it was cool to get a ride from him, its been a long time since I've seen him.  Right when we got there, he started talking so I just walked up the stairs. I guess he didn't feel compelled to hang out with me, since its not like I'm new or something. When I got upstairs, they have those little poles with the ribbons stretched from one pole to the next, like to make a line (not sure what they're called, but like they have to get into a club or something - to herd the people) leading to where you get name tags at *snort*.  I saw Priscilla there, and she has really changed. I'd hate to say that she's been brainwashed...but it sure looked like it. She has turned into one of their flunkies - like I used to be (again - my perception.) She gave me a name tag, acted excited to see me (dont know if it was genuine or not) and then explained their new rule that you cant go to the bathroom after it starts (what!?)  So I walked into the main room thing, saw these two girls that I went to Elementary School with that recognized me (I recognized them after they asked me if I remembered them) and then I walked in and got a seat, after hugging Linda (probably the only person there that I know for sure loves and cares about me - the rest may - but since they never kept in contact or anything - its unlikely.)  I went inside and sat alone - because I had my eyes dilated today and didn't really see anyone right away that I knew (and really there wern't that many of them there.) I've concluded that they either have left (not a huge surprise) or they became middle school leaders and were there earlier and since went home. I cant picture Elias and Ishmael leaving since they have been converted from catholic to protestant and really regard Corenrstone high - so they probably became leaders or just wern't there tonight. Elias was one of the people I was closest to - but it was almost an unspoken closeness - we didn't talk that much but both seemed to enjoy each other's company.  Well - Xscape now has this video at the beginning that has "the rules", which includes a bunch of random (illegal and pirated) video clips, a bunch of songs (someone likes Twista) and it was dumb. That new rule "You cant go to the bathroom - no matter how bad" is the stupidist thing I've ever heard. I understand the concept behind it - it is disruptive to the speaker to get up and go during them speaking - but its still really dumb. They sell all kinds of various foods and drinks. They're  asking  for people to have to go to the bathroom. Whats up with that? And what if someone was sick and needed to take a dump? I personally have a lot of stomach problems and never know when I'm gonna have to just go in a seconds notice - so that just sucks.  The rules also went on to say that "if you dont like these rules - we can escort you to the exit." God, if I would have been new and not known how they really are, I probably would have walked out. That is really stupid. And I bet anything I knew who came up with those rules too...  Well - the video at the end had a five second count down - then there was the dramatic entrance of the worship team - which made everyone come to the front of the room and then they have  no  worship anymore. Everything is high paced praise. They want everything to be happy and fun I guess - but thats not reality. How is there reverance in all that praise?  It was interesting that several people came over right away and said whats up to me. I mean, it didn't exactly surprise me, but it was just surprising...if that makes sense. I mean - it was real - that was surprising - but that they came over wasn't surprising. Daniel ran right over and Jennifer stopped me in the hall and said hi. She even commented on my cartilage piercing (which I think the left part is infected.)  Right after worship I glanced over and saw John, Randy's (this former youth leader who really reached out to me and was thus really hurt by Cornerstone) little brother. After everything that happened with Randy (the pastor telling off his Mom over the phone) I'm really surprised to see his brother.  Michael (youth leader) spoke on the prodigal son and there were several comments that other people didn't really catch that I caught. There was a comment about how people dont come to Xscape because they dont agree with how its run (so I guess I'm not the only one...or maybe that was aimed at me) and then he made another comment, toward the end, about how he's seen fired up youth leaders just...fade away over time and get lost because they try to deal with their issues on their own (which is totally me.)  He forgot to add on there that Cornerstone tells you to go to them, and not God to get help with stuff. But the message was indirectly for me I guess. It was about coming bitter and stuff and turning away from God and how to know if you're backslidden or lost or what and how you can get back.  Right now I'd really like to get back straight with God, but I have a couple issues. The generally uneducated-in-worldly-matters Christian community has no knowledge of science and political matters - so they automatically go with what someone tells them (classical example of brainwashing) and Christianity in general doesn't give credit to science.  Two - I like my sin. Sad to say - but I'm being honest. I like my sin - I would have to give it up to God and not do it anymore if I wanted to get back straight with him.  Three - I have a lot of issues with Cornerstone. I've been very hurt in the past and right now my heart it too hard and I'm to bitter to let them help me again. But tonight they did say to go to God with your problems - which I guess I can do. All they're gonna do is tell me to work my ass off for them and it will all go away - so I'm not gonna bother.  Four - yeah, I haven't been going to Xscape because I dont agree with a lot of what goes on there. Those stupid rules aren't going to help that. All of their other rules were a given. Whose gonna drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes or do drugs in church (come on.) And most people aren't going to cuss because they're being someone they're not to impress the church people. If I wanted to cuss, I would cuss no matter where I am. God see's it anyways - why pretend to be someone I'm not for church people who are themselves probably doing the same thing?  The thing that surprised me the most today was Richard. I was expecting him to come up to me, act all excited to see me, tell me how much he loves me, etc, etc because either he knows how I feel about him or just he knows my reasons for leaving.  I don't dislike Richard in the least. I think he's an awesome guy, but in a lot of ways he's way overboard - which I dont like. And I dont agree with a lot of how he runs things - but thats his job, not mine, and his choice to make, however I am entitled to my opinions and I decide if I go there or not. But it was cool to see that he didn't come over and pretend to like me. I mean, I was trying to avoid him, but when I was leaving, he grabbed me, hugged me and then I was on my way. He didn't try to get mushy, he didn't try to talk to me - and that gave me temendous respect for Richard. I didn't really have respect for him before now. I mean he were there, I love all three of his kids, so I couldn't obviously totally dislike him - but now I have that respect. He wasn't trying to force me to be someone I'm not, to do something I dont want, etc.  So even though, if possible, it got worse, I'm gonig to keep going back. I dont know if I will ever get back to where I was, or if I want to ever be a leader again - just because I have to be someone I'm not for a cause I dont believe in and be brainwashed - but I may be able to lead a dance thing.  Also...very wierd - you have to have a leadership certification... The beginning "leadership" positions are vacuuming, operating a camera, giving out nametags, etc. What is there to be certified for? I'm guessing its some kind of brainwashing session where they tell you how much God is going to bless you for working for them. You're going to get a special place in heave, etc, etc. I was never subjected myself to that, but what else could it be?  Well - I'm gonna stop bitching now. I'd like to talk to Gabe and some people there just to get an idea if they still love me or if its a game. Gabe and I used to be pretty tight and then through the time I haven't been there he's gotten pretty distant. He doesn't even answer e-mails and stuff anymore - but then they're gotten pretty more advanced then they were. They have some powerpoint like program where the background is animated (no doubt pirated - like everything else.)  On last thought - its really ironic that I'd have to be certified if I was to get heavily involved again. I see the irony because I would be willing to pay that there is no one in that church more advanced then me when it comes to technology - especially computer related. They didn't even know that they could import slides from other presentations such as lyrics into one large powerpoint presentation. They had individual presentations for each song, for the message, etc - so I taught them something as basic as that. Other then graphic art and maybe video editing and possibly the hook up or sound equiptment (which is more of just the knowledge of how something is assembled rather then actual knowledge) there would be no one who knows that I know about technology, yet I would have to be oriented (certified) as well...thats pretty whacked up.  -Mb

       Well - even though I've been hurt by Cornerstone a lot in the past I'm going back to their youth tonight, so face people I've burnt bridges with and then friends who I haven't heard with - I dont know if I'm like a dog going back to it's vomit or something - but maybe this will be good?  I've always enjoyed Xscape in the past and I guess all I can hope for is that the people I've burnt bridges with don't hold grudges...  I dont know if I have a way of getting a ride - so I may be taking the bus and then walking like 1/2 - 3/4 a mile...but oh well. I guess if all goes wrong I can just leave - I'm kinda nervous about it actually.  Speaking of burnt bridges, on the way to the Optomitrist, my Dad was telling me that last night when he almost severed his finger while cutting an onion, he had to go to the ER, and then this neighbor that he'd been at it with over parking happened to be the head ER doc...man would he have been in bad shape if that doctor would have been the one who had to stitch up his finger - so I guess that tells me to be civil to people I dont like.  This eye doctor I had today I wasn't too impressed with. She didn't seem to really care about her patients - she was just doing her job and doing the list of stuff they're supposed to do. I miss the other doctor I used to have, Aaron Lech. I just tried looking up an e-mail for him, but all I found was an Address and Phone number - which probably doesn't even exist anymore, since he's in the Navy and has probably been transferred to another hospital by now - plus I would seem very stalkerish if I was to call...so I guess unless he gets an e-mail thats listed, I've lost contact.  What really sucks is Dr. Lech was willing to go all the way with my vision - he lied about a non-existant disease to get me free contacts and stuff from the military and I was a little kid who didn't want to be bothered back then. Now I have this conceited female civilian doctor who doesn't want to be bothered...ick.  Well - yeah, off I go.  Out-

       Today in Psychology it was interesting. We were doing learning and the psychological principals behind learning. We also looked into conditional and unconditional responces and stimulus.  As one of those examples, the teacher showed us a clip that had this kid just screaming and freaking out in a store because his Dad wont buy him candy. He was screaming, rolling around on the floor, throwing stuff, etc. He goes on and on and the Dad looks hopeless. Then in big letters over the screen comes up "Use Condoms." My whole class almost died laughing.  The teacher was saying that if you're not 18 you have to get outta the room or something. And then she asked is anyony under 18 and like 4 of us said "I'm 15" and the teacher was astonished. But then she concluded that we had a form signed by a parent and they know that College is for adults coming in and then we didn't have to leave after all.  Dance was awesome but hard today. We added a lot onto the Lyrical Britney Spears dance which is turning out to be really pretty. Its a dance that I completely have so far, compared to the Jazz Dance which is evil and I dislike a lot.  I found out Mrs. MAcias is gonna teach full time at CPH - teaching PE, which is so awesome it makes my whole day. Again I think shes like the coolest teacher in the world and one of my favorite people - and now I get to go bug her when I feel like randomly getting out of class *whee*! I'm hoping to be able to be her aide or something I'm going to try and do it this year but may need to wait until next year.  New post in Biting My Nails  urlLink Click Here

       I seriously feel for my Dad's mental state or lack-there of.  Last night we were watching Cold Mountain and at the end of the movie he was like "this was such a deep and powerful movie - I'm surprised you have an interest in it" *dies*. Does he not know me at all? Does he forget how smart I am (way smarter then himself)? I swear, not braging or anything - but I'm in all honors, have been way above all my peers intellectually since I was like 5...and he doesn't understand how I could appreciate a "deep" movie. How old does he think I am? 5?  And a lot of times I tell him I saw or want to see a certain movie, his response - "Thats an adult movie son" just like that! But then he'll let me watch American Pie and dumb comedies. What are those? Wholesome family entertainment? The whole fucking movie is about sex! I'm looking for a movie where he said that... I think he said it to War of the Roses or something like that. That movie was only like PG...and who cares what the messages are in it? If they're so "adult" since I'm like 5, wont they just go  right over my head  or something?  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...(so on and so forth)  -Mb  PS: My friend/cousin (we call each other cousins, but really are not related by blood) just flew out to Florida this morning. She has  very dysfunctional family and now that she's 18 she left. I guess thats admirable - but I wish she could have just got out on her own here in Cali. Why go clear to Florida where she knows no one? Oh well - I give her 6 months before she's back. She's never really had to work - although she was the slave at her house, when she wasn't slaving she had a really mushy life. She's never had to provide for herself. Just wipe her Mom's smelly ass (literally).

       Today I went to the movies with Lee and my Mom before Lee goes to Florida tomorrow - since she is moving there cuz he life sucks.  First off we went to Lolitas and I got a Taco and then we went and saw the notebook. After that I came back to my Dad's.  And then I came on the net and got in a fight with one of my best friend online contact people - Michael M. over something really stupid. Apairently between my comment that he went over his limit in space on his domain (I host him free and he was 17 mbs over his limit - or 170% more space then I gave him) and him breaking up with his girlfriend - it sent him over the edge and now he's having some kind of fit... He just said something about how he doesn't want to be five different people anymore - he doesn't what to explain what he means by that and now he isn't talking to me...wierd. Maybe multiple personalities?  My REVIEW of THE NOTEBOOK:   I went to see The Notebook, a movie derived from a book written Nicholas Sparks – the dramatic love story between two lovers, Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams) and Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling.)  It starts out in a Nursing home with a senior version of Noah Calhoun is reading a story out of a “notebook” written by his now delirious wife, Allie Nelson. Through reading the story of how they met and how they fall in love, Allie has bouts where she remembers and then slips back into her delirium and freaks out, at one point physically hurting Noah.  The director of this movie had no problem showing us how hunky Ryan Gosling is, in several love scenes. The main theme of this movie was two teenagers falling in love in a small North Carolina town. Allie was a rich girl living in Charleston, North Carolina who goes to a small North Carolina town on the ocean, to live in her summer house. Noah is a poor, simple (sexy!) country boy who doesn’t have two nickels to rub together but wins Allie’s heart through several social events. Of course, Allie’s snobbish parents do not approve of someone who only makes 40 cents an hour and pull Allie and Noah apart.  Once forced back to Charleston, Noah writes 365 letters to Allie, one per day of the year. Allie’s mother, in Charleston, takes every one of her letters from Noah and hides them – so because of a bitter break up, figured Noah wants nothing to do with her and moves on in life.  The movie was very sad in parts and had me crying more then once. But all in all was a very romantic chick-flickish movie. I would defiantly recommend it.

       Just saw on the news, since Dad has it on about 24/7, that they are making power cells out of Spinach. They already have a spinach cell battery that will power an average laptop for three weeks - but apairently they're only 12% effective and they fun off of photosynthesis - so no sun - no power. They're gonna have to get the spinach to run the Krebs Cycle when theres no sun (which is a chemical cycle that produces energy.)  I think this is really cool - its going to make power more efficient in time, completely natural, gonna help the environment and there will be so much less spinach for me to have to eat - since they're gonna be making batteries out of it.  Out-

       Today has been interesting. At 12 we left for a Padres game at Petco Park. I really had a bad attitude about going because I'm not a big Baseball fan. But the park was awesome, they had a cute black lab puppy that I wanted to take home, I actually understood a little of what was going on in the game and I got a lot of food. LOL  We had a couple of wierd characters around us - this dude that's fat hung so far over his seat that I was crowded and had no leg room. I swear his fat hung a good foot over the chair and he was right in front of me. He moved a lot though - and finally because we were getting so sun burnt me and my Dad moved to the back section of where we were to get in the shade.  The highlight of the game was this flag that took up most of the field and then the jets flying at mach 5 over us. Was loud - but cool.  After the game we went to Applebees where I got this nasty orange chicken platter thing and my Dad got all you can eat riblets - but all he actually ate was the ribs of one helping - he didn't even touch his fries or cole slaw (that best part) but got all wierd and angered when I suggested that one order was "more then you can eat" and just a regular meal was cheaper - so I left him alone and let him waste his money.  After we were done eating we walked around the mall a little, I found the Piercing Pagoda and then got my cartilage on both ears pierced for only $13 (including an extra bottle of ear care stuff.) Was a great deal. And I think the earrings are gold plated to prevent infection - so thats even a better plus. Although I was no in extreme pain and still am not - the cartilage hurt a lot more then the lobe (yesterday) hurt me.  After the mall we came home and I replied to a load of random messages on this mailing list I'm on (http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/Any_Discussion) which lead to the inspiration to write an editorial (I dont really like it too much - it was inconsistant as a friend put it - and I'd have to agree) but heres the link if you wanna read it:  http://togzone.com/nuke/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=60&mode=&order=0&thold=0   I unfortunately had to go see fireworks, which wern't too impressive, before I got to write my editorial though. We went to the building my Dad works at downtown and went to the roof to watch the fireworks and he was being all paranoid that me, his "little baby" was gonna go walking off the side of the building or something. I swear he treats me like I'm 5, when in all reality I'm probably more intelligant and more mature then he is in many ways. But he and this other engineer had to raise the flag and had to keep going back to the flag to try it again because right when they'd think its safe - the wind out pick up and they didn't want to get sucked up in the air. When they finally did it, I walked within 50 feet of the harmless flag pole and my Dad said if I dont go back to the way other side of the building - we were going to go home. Well - first off, since I was certainly 10 feet atleast away from any potentially dangerous part of the flag pole - he should have been all happy that I'm interested in what he does for a living. Then I started the drama - when he was done I was like "You know - how you're threatoning me that we're gonna go home - you say that like I actually  want  to be here, and that is some punishment to leave - when in all reality it would be a favor" and you could see it on his face instantly that he was pissed. Whats really interesting is that he didn't blow - and he has major anger issues - so he excercised a lottt of self control in not doing that. I guess he already is consided a bitch by his co-workers cuz he talks loud, is wierd and thinks he's all that - so he didn't want them to think he was absuse too...so basically I knew I went over the edge, got a reaction which is what I was looking for and had to give him some BS line about not meaning it so I dont get introuble and not be able to write my edtiroial when I got home. So we made up, I was miserable through the completely over-rated display of fireworks and we came home.  New post in "Biting My Nails" -  urlLink Click Here

       Until recently I've never remembered my dreams. Then in psychology we talked about dreams and sleep patterns in general and the past few nights I've remembered my dreams - so I've decided when I remember the dreams long enough to enter them here and then have time to do so I'm going to keep track of my dreams. Should be fun.  Last night I dreamt that I was in Mammoth Lakes CA on the ski resort in July and Mammoth was way smaller then it actually is, yet there were signes that said Mammoth (dont ask). I was skiing dont some last remaining snow, right along side a grassy area (I vaguely remember something about my Dad's explorer being up there with me) and I just remember a lot of grass. And then in the end, I skiied down the hill until I was in complete grass and then the dream just ended...  I think we were at the top of the hill or something.  I think I dreamed about this dream because I was looking at this Mammoth book my Dad had. Their monthly newspaper or something and it just caused me to reminisce about when I went skiing there. Only real definition other then it was a just a completely random dream. Only wierd thing is that the place I was in looked nothing whatsoever like Mammoth Lakes CA and there was very little actual snow + plus it wasn't cold.  Then the other night I had a dream that I was laying in my living room floor at my Mom's on my phone then I woke up at 12 years old with my best friend sitting in my chair at the dining room table assembling some sort of food while my Mom was cooking it and then I looked like I did when I was 12, except internally I was 15 and then I used my cell phone - that somehow worked when it runs on completely different signals then they even had back then (but then its a dream - they're not legalistic) and I called my English teacher to see if she knew me to find out how to get home. I dont remember our specific conversation though. I guess I associate my English teacher as a very smart and very informed individual who could help me - which she probably could have. So I think that is symbolic as someone I can maybe turn to for help on life matters? And then I remember just...ending the dream. I dont remember if she knew me or anything.  Well off to the Padres Game.

       Well its been interesting lately. Been as hot as hell to start. Today it was 91 degrees farenheit, 100% humidity and the heat/humidity index (according to weatherbug) was 123 degrees...no wonder I feel so ick.  &nbsp;  Right now its really nice to not have the extra weight carrying around to have to contend with and be more hot (if I was as fat as I used to be I'd be worse off emotionally by the weather.) Both of my parents have been totally evil the last few days because of the weather and its getting annoying. Tonight my Dad got paged and was in the shower so he didn't hear his pager and when he did come out he was freaking out about it...*sigh* dont know whats up with him. Then he called work and told someone off or something. I think its humorous but sad.  &nbsp;  Today my Dad picked me up at my Mom's house and then we went to Sports Authority where I bought some resista-bands to go along with my Yoga-Pilates workout and they're really helpful. All the people at Sports Authority were evil though. I dont know if they just dont value their customers or if the heat was getting to them too (but then the place is air conditioned...so I dont think thats it.)  &nbsp;  I was gonna go to Xscape tonight and listen to Gabe speak and stuff but I concluded thats its too damn hot plus Xscape is upstairs, so that would be a really bad deal since heat rises and there are enough sweaty/hot people up there just because of the intense action and the friction as it is without it being 90 with no AC.  &nbsp;  Also today, on a better note, my check from Blurb came. I finally got my $20 and this is a really good time to get it.  &nbsp;  Also today I've been trying to recruit some people to come to BMG Music because I'm running low on free CDs and I need to replenish my stash.  &nbsp;  On&nbsp;a sadder note, this dude Michael M. who I've been internet friends with for a long time kinda broke it off with me today cuz we were arguing and he was being stupid and threatoned to block me (wrong thing to do) so to show him that he has like no persuasion over me I said go ahead and block me...and he did. Kinda sad deal - but I'm sure he's gonna unblock me in time. I'm not about to apologize, cuz he was the one being stupid. He'll probably need me for something and IM me. Then I can be all hardass on him.  &nbsp;  Tonight my Dad and I went to La Bella Pizza and then got this one kinda pizza with mushrooms, onions, pepperoni and green peppers and then went to Blockbusters and he got mad in the car cuz I wanted to rent "Mean Girls" cuz I like Lindsay Lohan...and left blockbuster and drove home *sigh*. I guess I can blame it on this heat?     Then he came home, turned on the AC and then went to bed. So I've been just up messing around. Have a&nbsp;psych quiz&nbsp;on Monday so I'm gonna have to get studying sometime this weekend to be ready for it. &nbsp; Also talked to one of my best friends, Isaac Martinez and he's been telling me he went to UCSD for this upward bound program thingie to get high school credit and the whole under-under-grad experiance thing going and apairently he's miserable. He figured it would be all laid back and he said its constant homework. And what really sucks is that he doesn't even get college credit for it. I think it counts toward his High School GPA. And it sounds like the classes are totally accellerated, where they get a whole credit for the classes (a whole year) in 6 weeks. So its interesting nonetheless. &nbsp; He's also going out with this girl that I told him I liked - its not the first time he did that. I told him I like someone, he gets to know them to help me out and then I dont do anything and he ends up liking them himself and taking them. It sounds like they're pretty happy too. Movies and stuff. I guess thats cool. I'm pretty happy for him. &nbsp; I also told him about this one guy that asked me out at SWC (he's very naive and homo phobic) and I just said that I told him "thanks but no thanks" and I told him even though it was a guy it was a total compliment to be asked out cuz someone thought I was hot (if he only knew). And he went on to say that he's glad he wasn't there cuz he would have beat the guy up *rolls eyes*. I explained that that would be 1) a hate crime and 2) assault and battery. I think its sad that in this day and time with all the gay marriage and gay rights movement that he is still so conservative in terms of his homo phobicness. But then this is the latin community of southern california living back in the 40s and stuff. "stone the fags" so to say. &nbsp; Oh well. &nbsp; Peace- &nbsp; PS:  urlLink Biting My Nails &nbsp;has been updated

       Need to be concise here because I dont have that much time and I need to go to Admissions in a little bit and register for a course, but today we had a written dance final and then just kinda hung out and watched our dance performances on past tests and did&nbsp;a mild workout. &nbsp; In Psychology I found out that my overall grade is up to 100%, which is a great thing - and I also found out that my Mom has had someone spying on me (Denise someting) in my dance class. The whole semester she has been reporting my activity to my Mom...*grr* &nbsp; Also I found out that my Modern Dance class starts on August 16th - so I'm going to have very little time off of school this summer. My psych class ends on the 29th, I go on vacation until like the 15th, then I start Modern Dance on the 16th and then on I think the 17th I have to go to this thing at my s chool to get trained for freshmen orientation (I'm in Link Crew) and then on the 23rd I have to go to High School for myself and then on the 7th of September I start High School full time while maintaining a college course on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Should be an interesting year. &nbsp; Mom and I are still at each others throats I think because of the weather - and I just finished my book. Yay me! The Amulet of Samarkand was a really good book (My Review  urlLink Click Here ). My book Silenced by Jerry Jenkins came in the mail yesterday and thats next on my list to read. &nbsp; So yeah - need to be gone now and go register. &nbsp; Ciao - Love and Lobsters - Peace &nbsp; PS: In 6 weeks of dance I've lost one pant size and one shirt size (down to a 38 waist and down to a Large shirt) but I haven't lost and pounds. I still weigh 240. So I guess I need to start running or something *sigh*.

       Well today I have my dance "dancing" final during which we danced both dances: the prop-chair dance to Confessions by Usher and a really pretty lyrical dance to Everytime by Britney Spears.  I was talking to Mrs. Mascias today and telling her about how I dont get along with my Mom and stuff and she said basically "dude - you're a teenager - you're not supposed to like your parents" so I guess thats settled? She also went on to (I think this was yesterday) tell me that I should go straight on to UCSD rather then going to Community College because I'm too smart to be with the slackers and I'll probably myself get lazy at Community College. But she said if finances are a problem then go to SWC for GE stuff and lower division classes because she said Student Loans suck.  Also I wrote this letter about me being her Aide and she signed that off too. Thats awesome. I can be an aide for my favorite teacher. She's gonna have to get back into bitchy mode though at the High School (she's not a bitch at all - but she has to be all tough and stuff at the High School) because theres a bunch of un-motivates little freshmen (hah! I can make fun of them now! Like I would do that... fuck conformity) and they like...will be chewing gum which they can choke on during PE and stuff. I was telling her that she should make them do some dance stuff, but apairently she's not supposed to do that. I'm hoping she'll sneak some in there because kids should be enlightened more with the arts. They should force everyone to take an artistic class. Dance, Drama or Music. They can easily opt out with Art 100 (equivelant with college).  Well - our final was good I guess. Cant say the same about my Psych test though - I dont think I did too hot on that one - but maybe I did too? But anyways - the dance test, I was a little ahead on some of the counts of the songs, but my technique was really good for the most part. I dont think I made any mistakes, except being early on the counts.  Psychology, the hot dude that is my current eye candy, when the teacher said sex is a "need" and not just a "desire" said "I better tell me Girlfriend that. 'I need sex Baby' and then maybe I can get it 4 times a day." That dude is funny. Too bad he doesn't like boys...I would be on him in a second. But oh well. Whatever floats your boat I guess. It seems all gay guys are those steryotypical fashion obsessed lunaticts whose life's goal is to be a hair stylist. But oh well - hopefully I'll find my someone. I just dont want a steryotpicaly hair stylist if I can help it.  Mom is still on the war path for the most part, but she seems to have calmed down. This terrible humid weather seems to be getting to her lately, but I'll be at my Dad's this weekend (dont know if that is a completely good thing) and will have a break from her.  Today at my Dad's I took some food to the computer, cuz he has this thing "when I call dinner, get your ass over to the counter." It has to be all formal, but we never eat together at home. Probably haven't eaten together more then 10 times. So I dont get it. But back to what I was saying, he said "I dont agree with you having food at the computer" so I was like "that nice." And continued eating. So he was like "do what I told you!" and I was like "You didn't tell me to do anything" which is the truth, so he got all pissed, told me "what to do" and then I complied. End of story.  Right now my Dad is freaking out. He's getting old and getting a "double chin" and the last couple of days he's been changing everything. Been walking a lot, been changing his diet to include a lot of meal supplements and replacements (he doesn't eat that much as it is.) What he doesn't understand is that 8 beers a nice isn't going to help his weight...thats like his caloree intake for a whole day. Even light beer (which he drinks - dont know why since it tastes like crap - but his internal organs and brain...not mine.)  Should be studying, but I'm gonna be lazy and do it in the morning.  Peace-

       My Mom has been a complete bitch the last couple of days, but then its been really humid and she doesn't do humidity or any form of heat well - so I guess I'm not gonna let it get personal if she calms down once the humidity goes away.  She's been biting my head off, not letting me on the comptuer to do hmwk, and just bitching constantly. Last night she told me I was evil and I'm bitter and all this shit and that if she didn't have to put up with me, she'd kick me out (ouch). This is what heat does to senile old bitches.  Then yesterday we went in this grocery store to buy hot cocoa, but nooo - she cant just buy one thing - that would be impossible (I swear she had issues with food - its hard to get her out of grocery stores and no matter how overflowing our garage is in food - she still buys more) but I guess she was somewhat good...she only bought a couple of things - but most of it we didn't need.  Finally after like...30 minutes of me waiting by the car she came out (with  another ) bag of something... But it gets better. After that, with ice cream of all things in our car, she goes for like an hour to deliver her Avon shit...so needless to say, my ice cream was all soft and icky when I got home...and is probably ruined. Re-frozen Ice Cream sucks.  While she was on the road delivering Avon books to various ghetto apartment complexes, I did recieve a call from one of my cousins, which was really awesome. Made me feel loved. I usually talk to him online, and he hadn't seen me on in a while (cuz of my stupid mother hogging it - or randomly not letting me on it for no appairent reason) so he called me to make sure everything is alright. Again, that rocked.  But back to ranting and raving (need to get this all out so I dont get pissed at her and mouth off and then in trouble), I was sleeping in her room, on the floor last night, because theres AC (Air Conditioning) in there, and she wouldn't turn the fucking TV off! It was like 11:00...she wasn't even  watching  it...but she insisted on it being left on. Finally at 11:30, probably 5 minutes before the sleep timer was gonna shut the TV off, she  finally  shut it off, which made me happy because I could actually go to sleep...  I think in the future I'm just gonna sleep in my room and roast to death - better than putting up with her crap. Also I had to listen to her tell me that I was no good, and always insult her (I pointed out, in all humility, that she used to beat me as a kid - which she denied, but got awfully defensive over) which I didn't, cuz it was true. And then she told me I'm cynical (which I am I guess, but she's way worse then me - and doesn't even see it about herself!) And then she went on to say that I never say anything nice about anyone, which is the biggest lie there is! I only dont say nice stuff about her or my Dad because they're both idiots (well - I do sometimes...but not too often - more often about my Dad then her - he at least makes an effort to be nice to me - she doesn't get anything for being nice to me - so why bother?)  Well - done ranting and raving - time to go bomb my psych quiz (thank God for extra credit.)  -Mb

       Church yesterday, with my Mom, was boring as it always is. And youth was even more boring. These rude people called me a nerd basically when the pastor asked what makes us individuals and I gave the psychological approach on it... they're lucky I didn't turn around and cuss them out. I mean - I didn't want to be there anyways and being escorted out would give me a reason not to go back that even my Mom wouldn't argue with.  Then at the end, this dude, Lamont (I guess he's a pastor now or something? Who knows) came up and gave this long speech about why we should tithe. Dude - its teens. Everyone who was going to tithe already had pre-determined it, probably got the money from their Mommy and the speech was a waste of your breathe and trying to my patience. Most of it I just tuned out, but I did distinctly catch something about "smashing the devil's face in the floor" *rolls eyes*. Most of the people there wouldn't even take on a simple, lowly demon and live through it - I'd like to see them smash satan's face in the floor. Damn naive people.  Then last night my Mom was a bitch too. I dont know what her problem was, but she was being truly evil last night and probably will continue it today.  I continued my psych behavior modification project - trying to modify my sleep patterns cuz I always go to bed too late cuz I usually take a nap or something - so its in the works. Was asleep by 12:00 am last night, which is an improvement I guess.  This morning, my bus was like 20 minutes behind and I figured I missed it, so I caught an alternate route (which is a good thing) and then I got to school like 30 minutes later then I usually do, but I thought it was an hour and 30 minutes later so I was running to my psych 101 class, and I was all winded and then I walked in and I saw all these people I've never seen before and I was like "Is this psych 101" and the instructor was like "that class hasn't started yet" and then I realised it was 9:30 instead of 10:30... I wanted to crawl under a desk and die. That was so embaressing.  Well right now its 10:0(something) and I should get to class - so peace out.

       My review:   Talking rabbits throughout the entire book, Watership down was a book that included tons of imagination on the author’s behalf, but in my opinion did not meet all the hype from various fans, proclaiming it the best book ever written. It didn’t really even take off until the last 100 pages or so and at the beginning was a very slow read – almost rendering me into such boredom that I put it down and went onto something else.  Once the book took off though, it was edge of your seat all the way to the end of the book. I think this book would have been much more exciting to me, being it talking Rabbits, had I not read the Redwall books in the past. But having read the Redwall books, talking animals are no new concept.  The author did a lot of research into the habits of wild rabbits, how they live, how they mate, their excretion habits, etc – and the book would have been loads better had it had some action in the beginning. Also, like Lord of the Rings, this was a very deep book – one that you can just sit down and read through while thoroughly enjoying because of its depth and messages to us, as humans, about destruction of woodland habitats, littering, encaging wild animals, etc – although I enjoyed this book much more then Lord of the Rings.

       I found a ride to Flood starting next week. Some dude in Chula Vista named Tony who I've likely met before but only vaguely remember. He was at Xscape this one time when I was still a leader and this band was there that he interned with or something.  Also Something Like Silas is going to use me for promotional stuff. The band member who I sent the e-mail too said to add me as a "key" street team contact and to add me on the promotional team. That is so awesome. I hope they put me to work cuz they're a really good band for a really positive cause.  Mom doesn't like to let me on the net anymore and I try to be at school as little as possible - so I dont hang out there on the net all the time anymore. Plus they have set every computer where you have to login with a student id number and it wont let me. This one time I kicked the power cord of the computer I was on accident and it turned off...and ever since then whenever I try to login it tells me I'm already logged in...so no go. They only have like 4 computers where you dont need an ID number. And thats probably not for long...so I'm screwed.  Next week is the last week of Psychology. Should be interesting. We have at least 3 more chapters to cover, so at least 3 more tests and 3 more quizs and then the final in 4 days... can someone say lack of sleep? But then its over and I'll have a long vacation.  Heres some cool quotes from TogZone:  *I'm multi-talented. I can talk and piss you off at the same time  *Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot  *I tried sniffing coke once but the ice cubes got stuck in my nose  *I'm not weird. I'm gifted  *True love burns the brightest...but the brightest flame leaves the deepest scar  *Pride is tasteless, colorless, sizeless but the hardest thing to swallow  *Consciousness is the annoying period of time in between naps  *Sorry, I haven't been the same since that house fell on my sister.  *Sarcasm is just another free service I offer.  *When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different. You know that your name is safe in their mouth.  *The more I know, the less I understand  *As long as you have one true friend you're famous  *Honesty is the best policy but insanity is the better defense  *Things that piss me off:  1) People who point at their wrist while asking for the time. I know where my watch is buddy, where is yours? Do I point at my crotch when I ask where the bathroom is?  2) When people say "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too."  Well, what good is a cake if you can't eat it?  3) When people say "It's always in the last place you look". Of course it is. Why would you keep looking after you've found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?  *Therapy helps but screaming obscenities is cheaper  *Never say oops always say "ahh interesting"  *Some mistakes are too fun to make one only  *We don't need torture cambers~we got them right between our ears  *True love doesn't have a happy ending, true love has no ending  *Once I had a dream. I was in the woods and I was running... running...  running... then I smacked into a tree  *There are no stupid questions, just stupid people  *If you never walk in the rain, you'll never know how good the sun feels  *You never know when you're making a memory.   Ill try to keep updating as much as I can though. Even though Mom thinks the net is evil and doesn't let me on *grr*.  -Michael  PS: Today I had to go to my High School and drop off papers for residency. I decided to take the bus cuz I have a pass and I'm lazy even though its only like a mile, and at the bus stop there was this wierd stoned lady talking to me about college. She seemed sane enough, but was very strange. Then the school told me the bill doesn't say "chula vista" on it...so I'm only half-registered and they need to follow up.  Tonight I'm supposed to meet my English teacher at Starbucks and my Mom said no...so I guess we're disrupting her plans... Which sucks a lot.  Well better get off here before I get caught and busted.

       Well I've been going through this whole crisis situation today and last night about how I want to test out of High School and go on to college and I got tons of good advice and was considering doing it until both of my parents were assholes about it. So I guess I'm staying high school now. Can continue to be anti-social and shit. Oh well.  I guess I'll take another college class and take High School and college concurrently or something.  Should be fun  PS: Would make this longer but I feel like crap, am tired and am in a bad mood. So I dont feel like writing.  Had Subway for dinner. Bombed test today. Put a bunch of cool stuff on TogZone (new avatars and smileys - go check them out - http://togzone.com)

       Evryone send hate mail to Inpop Records (joke). I requested an interview with Superchick so I could publish a story about them in Blurb magazine and they wrote back "Superchick is just too busy right now. Thank you for your interest". I bet if it would have been Peter Jennings they wouldn't have been too busy. But my audience, which is teens would have been much more in interest of the band then the general TV audience. How many teens watch World News Tonight? My audience on the other hand would be 50,000 or more teens in the San Diego area. Probably at least 100 of those 50,000 would have bought their CD (or acquired some of their songs in some way).   So now I'm not too thrilled. I just hope that the band will over-ride that decision if my e-mail gets through to them.

       Last night I was on the Something Like Silas website and I saw that in San Diego they were playing at something called "Flood" a lot, so I googled "Flood San Diego" and I found out that its a cuhrch thing. It looks really really really awesome. I was on their website a long time last night. I definately want to go out there. &nbsp; The only really bad part about it is that its clear out at College Avenue Baptist (like 30 minutes away) and it would be on a Sunday night that we went. Their only services are at 5, 7 and 9 pm. Whats really good though is that I can get a new start there. At Cornerstone I'm the evil sinner person, here they can see me for what I really am. Also its like a huge youth church. Most people there are between 18 and 28 according to the website. And their High School ministry looks small, so maybe I can easily become a leader again or something? I doubt any church will let you just jump up in there like Cornerstone does though. Thats unheard of. To be in leadership after like...3 weeks. Maybe it was my charm? (joke) &nbsp; Whats even better I think Something Like Silas leads the Worship at Flood. So maybe I can get to know the band people and then once I get to know them help them out and promote them and stuff. I've been looking for a band to do that with more directly then I do with Superchic[k], and my heart would be way more in it if the band people were friends rather then just random people who happen to sing well. &nbsp; Also hoping since this is as CABC, and I uesd to go there for BSF, that some of the less decent BSF people (like Ryan) dont go to Flood. Cant say I miss them... &nbsp; But off to shower and then class I go. &nbsp; (and as my cousin would say)   ok well, g2g, ttyl, bye!  (I refuse to do that on a blog - yet I just did it...how wierd. I basically feel this is your thoughts...and though you're writing for an audience, it is not for them like a conversation...so why say bye? I could say doing like I do "running to the shower or school" but to say ttyl (talk to you later) bye. Who are you talking to? OH well...had to put this in there.)

       Ol' Trey (his alias) turns out to be alive after all. I completely gave up on him ever signing back on the net. I used to be really close to him but we both got lives I guess and aren't anymore. I have his phone number and cant call him - so I'm really not holding my breath on ever really even talking to him again. If I do great, if I dont oh well. I've learned that getting close to internet people just hurts in the end when they turns out to be 60 year old perverts or just never come back on. I do, however, hope he's doing good and stuff though. He was an awesome guy. Also hope he's making good choices. Ok - so officially I'm letting go of him now. Used to think he was the greatest person in the world and stuff - no point in that anymore. Bye bye Tommy Miller.  urlLink

       My friend Catherine sent me this e-mail. Its pretty funny   At New York's Kennedy airport yesterday, an individual later discovered to be a public school teacher was arrested trying to board a flight while in possession of a ruler, a protractor, a set square, a slide rule, and a calculator.   At a morning press conference, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he believes the man is a member of the notorious Al-gebra movement. He is being charged by the FBI with carrying weapons of math instruction.   "Al-gebra is a fearsome cult," Ashcroft siad. "They desire average solutions by means and extremes, and sometimes go off on tangents in search of absolute value. They use secret code names like 'x' and 'y' and refer to themselves as 'unknowns,' but we have determined that they belong to a common denominator of the axis of medieval with coordinates in every country. As the Greek philanderer Isosceles used to say, 'There are three sides to every triangle."   When asked to comment on the arrest, President Bush said, "If God had wanted us to have better weapons of math instruction, He would have given us more fingers and toes."

       My views on US-Mexican border relations, as well as other illegal immigration.   For awhile now I’ve been very concerned and infuriated by illegal aliens cheating the American school system and wasting our tax dollars by coming to school, free to them, at a cost to us, in America. Illegal aliens also come to America when they are ready to give birth, hoping to have their child in the US in order to get welfare and other aid intended for American citizens. Putting a stop to this selfish unlawful occurrence would be the best choice for the American and Californian Government.  On top of all the other challenges facing the American educational system, massive illegal immigration is costing the nation’s schools $7.4 billion annually and has added 1.1 million students to the country’s already overcrowded classrooms (Dan Stein, editorial: Massive Illegal Immigration is Crippling America’s Schools, September 15, 2003.)  Living on the border, in California, a border state, I see firsthand on a daily the effects of having a school largely populated by illegal Mexican immigrants has on the California economy. We get new textbooks only every seven years because of budget cuts, are discouraged from using air conditioning unless it is unbearably hot (in schools that actually have air conditioning) because of budget cuts, have outdated technological equipment and generally go without in science labs because of budget cuts. This is but a small list of things we go without due in large part to illegal immigrants. The perks that we get in school usually come from the occasional grant and not the California school system. However, this problem would be greatly reduced if a method of preventing illegal aliens from attending American schools without paying tuition was instituted.  In California, which has the greatest number of illegal aliens in its schools and, not coincidentally, a budget deficit as large as the other 49 states combined, the $2.2 billion now devoted to educating illegal immigrants could be spent hiring an additional 41,764 teachers, or adding enough new schools so that no child in the state is sitting in an overcrowded classroom (Dan Stein, article: Massive Illegal Immigration is Crippling America’s Schools, September 15, 2003.)  Some would say that I sound selfish, others would say heartless, and still others would say I don’t know what its like to not have all the benefits that I have as an American. And they’re right, I don’t know what it’s like. But the opportunities in America are just that, for Americans. Not everyone else in the world who doesn’t want to earn what we, as Americans, have. America didn’t just appear and end up this way. It would be different if the illegals became citizens, but they don’t want to give back to America or have any responsibility (like paying taxes that go toward schools) that Americans have. They just want the perks Americans have earned, without being an American.  Debating this issue with others at my school I’ve been informed that “education is not free in Mexico” and I’ve tried to explain that it isn’t free in America either. Yet most Mexicans and even many misinformed Americans have the misconception that it is free here. Yes I agree its unfortunate that they do not have education provided by the state in Mexico, but why should American citizens have to go without? How is it our problem that education is not provided in Mexico?  This brings me onto another topic, illegal Mexican immigrants crossing the border shortly before they are due to give birth to their child. In many cases the pregnant woman has no idea who the father of her child even is and happens to be so poor that she doesn’t feel she can support her baby in Mexico, so she comes to America to have her child and make her “American” child the responsibility of a government which she does not claim belonging. This is another way American tax dollars are wasted on illegal immigrants.  Also keep in mind, welfare breeds’ welfare. Any illegal immigrant turned temporary resident’s children will think the same way they do. “I have no allegiance to this country anyways, so why not get everything I can free from it, I can always run to Mexico if something goes wrong.” That is exactly the mentality they have; I’ve heard just that, repeated numerous times.  There are approximately 8 million undocumented immigrants in the United States; 2.5 million reside in California. The costs of providing social services to these individuals and incarcerating illegal immigrants is staggering - easily exceeding $3 billion a year (Arnold Schwarzenegger’s undocumented immigrant agenda, http://www.joinarnold.com/en/agenda/#E1.)  Immigration is a national responsibility and California should not be left to shoulder the massive burden of providing public services to illegal immigrants. If an immigrant does not want to be become a citizen they shouldn’t be allowed here unless they have a visa granted for a certain period, to visit.  Amazingly, even with the knowledge of the above stated statistics, very little has been done in prevention. However, one of the most significant efforts within California was that in 1994 by Gene Garman. Garman proposed that California work off of a school voucher system where legal residents of California with social security numbers receive annual school vouchers usable at either a private institution or a public school. This would have made it where residents could go to either type of school and it would have prevented illegal undocumented immigrants from lying about their addresses, because regardless of their “cousin’s” address: no social security number, no American school. It’s as simple as that.  However, the teachers and public school district officials were very concerned that if children had the choice of going to private schools over public schools with school vouchers, they would be unemployed because no child in their right mind would chose a public school over a private, so the proposed bill for school vouchers was pushed out.  The school districts in California try to put a stop to illegal aliens going to our schools, but in all realization they really just make it harder for residents to go to school. Illegal immigrants simply use a relative’s address, lying about having residence and their children go to American schools, undermining the entire purpose of residency verification. I have various friends that brag about how many school documents come to their houses when school is starting and how many report cards come to their house at the end of a semester, addressed to their various distant relations. They think it’s a cool thing that they are getting over on the American Government and getting something for free, at our expense.  Rumor has it that Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California is in the works of passing a law where there will be a certain amount of time for all illegal residents of California to apply for citizenship and then all whom are denied citizenship (or who never sought citizenship) would be deported if over the set amount of time. Though, I have not been able to confirm the validity of this rumor. However, I think this “rumor” easily and without question would be the best-case scenario for California. To have a closed border after a set period of time, where, after the border is closed, all non US residents would have to have a visa for a temporary visit in order to cross the border.  Closing the border to illegal children going to American schools and preventing illegal adults from giving birth in the US would save California billions of dollars and it would make our schools much better in the long run. He would have supplementary current text books, less crowded classrooms, schools that speak primarily one language, newer technological equipment, more athletic resources, more of a budget for clubs and much more. Schools would be better for everyone.  Most Californian schools have bilingual classrooms, a sure sign, if someone doesn’t even know the language, that they don’t live here. Our taxpayers’ dollars knowingly go to educating illegals. What is wrong with this picture? If an American was to go to France or Germany (or gasp Mexico) you can sure as hell bet they wouldn’t be educated in English rather than the county’s native language.  On closing, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a classic example of an immigrant who became a citizen. He came here from Western Europe, knowing little to no English and probably very little about America, yet he tried and worked tirelessly to become a citizen. Look where he is now. He is a very popular actor, who has won multiple awards and has recently become governor of California. If he can do it, any other immigrant can do it; they just have to expend a little effort. If they were to become citizens, and were giving back to the California economy we would be much better off and have much more of a budget not just as a state, but also as a country.  Note: Wanted to clarify, that though I'm still moderatly against illegal residents living in the state of California, someone living here (a resident) has every right to go to American schools. They are a resident after all. My comments on illegal immigrants not going to American schools was in terms of those who come over the border in the morning, go to American schools, use a "cousins'" address and then go back over the border at night.   And on another note, although this article seemingly targets only Mexican immigrants, it applies to any other immigrant too. The problem in Southern California, obviously since we're on the border, is Mexican immigration.   If you would like anything clarified, have any questions or would like anything changed for political correctness, please let me know via a comment or a private message.   Comment I recieved:  Re: Open Us-Mexican Border - A Mistake? (Score: 0) by Anonymous on Saturday, July 31 @ 16:44:04 PDT (IP: 68.32.2.111)  I challenge you on this... America as a whole is a wealthier country than Mexico or most countries that bring in a lot of illegal aliens... and as a Christian, we should be willing to sacrfice things to help others. I challenge you to look at this from a Christian perspective, and remember that Christ requires us to put others before ourselves. What makes you think that just because you were born in a wealthier nation, you deserve to have a better education than the less fortunate? You being born in another country doesnt make you any better or any more deserving than anyone else. Think about this... what if you were one of them? All you want is the best for your child, a strong education and for them to live in a place where they have more opportunity than if they were in their home country. My opinion, you need to stop thinking about yourself and think about others. That's what Christ would have done.   So what? Some of your tax dollars go to those who are less fortunate... think of it as saving a life rather than a waste of money. You are sharing with those less fortunate. Don't be self-centered... Jesus had every right not to die for us, it was unfair of him. But he managed to show his love for dying for us. You should extend the same kind of love for others.   Afterall, Jesus was a Jew and could have only saved the Jews... after all they were HIS people, and he could have wanted only the best for his nation... he could have said, "Only the Jews deserve salvation because only they pay taxes to the Jewish government." Thank goodness he didn't say that, huh?

       Today was definitely interesting to say the least.  I slept in till about 12:00 pm because I was up so late the night before (and am up really late right now) and then went on the computer for about an hour and worked on my site, togzone.com – I installed a bunch of new stuff, answered some of the topics on the forum and wrote an article for it.  Then I worked around the house, cleaned up cat poop, scrubbed the ceiling and cleaned my bathroom (all shiny and pretty now). When my Mom got home I was just finishing up cleaning my bathroom, jumped in the shower and then we went to see “The Village”.  My review of "The Village"   Mysterious from the beginning, the Village was a very unique and interesting movie. It showcases a valley “village” surrounded by a forest and isolated from “the towns’ with happy residents virtually free for any sort of crime and evil.  Written by M. Night Shyamalan, The Village stars Joaquin Phoenix (Mel Gibson’s Brother in Signs), Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver and is categorized as “Drama, Romance, Science Fiction/Fantasy and Thriller” by  Yahoo! Movies .  The villagers stay inside of their village and “those whom we do not speak of” stay in their forest. Until something changes (or does it), the villagers and creatures kept to themselves, in peace. According to one of them main characters, “those of whom we do not speak, have not been inside the village boundaries in many years.”  From the beginning of the movie, a series of odd events happen. Two young women are playfully sweeping their porch until they see a red flower that they promptly bury. Later in the movie, Adrien Brody’s character acquired some red berries that are also promptly buried, implying that something is strange about the color red. What does it do to “those whom we do not speak of”?  The color yellow also seems to be conspicuous. People of the village, at times, wear druid looking robes the color yellow. Also, along the boundary of the village, the torches used to ward off “the creatures” have yellow banners draped on them. What anxiety does the color yellow cause?  M. Night Shyamalan put a lot of deep thought into this movie, many elements of suspense and some very twisted thinking, however the movie gives away the twist (and the climax) way too early. The viewer knows what is going to happen and the plot gets boring for about 20 minutes. Shyamalan would have been better off to hold off the twist, as in Signs, until the end of the movie.  I wouldn’t rate this movie as an excellent movie, however nor is the movie in by any means a bad movie. It is just a very strange movie, one that is not good or bad. I do, however, feel the movie is a very deep movie, with quite a few messages about the nature of man and what anxiety can cause man to do to stop it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who doesn’t frighten easily, as The Village is a very suspenseful movie, however by no means a “horror” movie. Just a tip: plug your ears when suspenseful scenes come on. The music gets VERY loud.  All in all I was disappointed with this movie. I’ve been anticipating seeing the movie since I saw a teaser trailer beck in December and once it was over…I was very disappointed.  Some well written movie review quotes from users of  Yahoo! Movies :  From user  drudashoe913  (their review:  urlLink Click Here )   You will get a great storyline, absolutely amazing acting and characters (probably the best part about the movie, I think some of the acting could possibly be Oscar-worthy!!), some real scares (I almost jumped out of my seat a couple of times), and an ending that will leave you feeling utterly dissapointed. Remeber the phrase, "What seems too good to be true, probably is."   From user  ademptious18  (their review:  urlLink Click Here )   Further, I was shocked that Shyamalan would have so much political commentary in the movie. First of all, the leader, who is trying to freak out all the people as a power ploy, conventiently has the name "Walker" (Funny story, thats Bush's middle name and is a subtle commentary on Bush's policy with the war on terror). Further, the warning colors around the town are the same code yellow that we are on, and the bad color, the warning color, is of course red. I won't continue and ruin the story, but Shyamalan could have made the movie far better by focusing on delivering a worthy scare than on political commentary.     After seeing "The Village" I came to my Dads and then we ordered a pizza, I worked on TogZone a lot more and made a bunch of new changes and a bunch of additions and then talked to my friend Carrie for a long time.  Nothing that interesting today. Mom has actually been letting me on the computer though. Which is big improvement from how she usually is.  And also we're going on this "drive up the coast" vacation thing where we're driving along the coast all the way up to the Bay Area. And then back down. Should be interesting being in the car with my Mom 9 hours each way.  Also: this dude from Cornerstone instant messaged me because of one of my Xscape ranting and ravings where I insulted him. I was totally sorry about it...look what ranting and raving can do to you. So I edited the insult (that wasn't directly to him, but stll taken as an insult) and now that he loves me again, we're gonna go to the movies next week and see The Bourne Supremacy! Yay!  Yesterday I went to my Aunt's house (not really my aunt, but a really good family friend) and I hung out with Beth, best friend/cousin (again, not blood cousin) and we hung out. Then I borrowed The Bourne Identity from them so I could watch it again before I go with that dude next week. Was such a good movie. I forgot how good it was. And the ending rocked.

       Well tonight I've been making tons of changes to TogZone.com  One of my friends, Zach, who I haven't talked to in a long time joined up today and he already has 60 something posts on the forums. Thats crazy. He's really getting it to liven up. I've also been drafting up some documents for the site, I setup a board of advisors (The Council and "The Round Table") and then made a lot of propositions and worked out some errors.  Then I was talking to this guy that I met the other day, Moises and he wants to meet up and go see The Village on Friday. I told him the first time we need up it has to be with a parents present so I know he's not gonna kidnap me or something and he agreed to that. So we shall see if he actually shows up or not. If he doesn't, its a sure sign he's a psycho stalker freak person. If he does, I might have just found a really good new friend.  Well - I have finals tomorrow, I still have some chores to do and I need my sleep - so I'm gonna be going now.  My Mom actually let me on the net tonight. Its a miracle and she even trusted me enough to be on while she's in bed. I feel truly loved tonight. She probably would freak out if she knew I was still on the net...but still pretty shocked she let me on. She usually seems to have major issues with the net.  Oh well. Time to do chores then sleep.

       Today was awesome at school. I got there early, was talking to Manny and this one girl about porn, alcohol and how when you leave home and go out on your own, you dont know how to cook (believe me, I didn't pick those topics). Then we did some last minute cramming for the quiz (which we didn't have - thank God) and we went in the room when the teacher got there.  She called me, Rebecca and this other girl (forgot her name) up to the front of the room and she told us that we have the highest grades in the class and it would be wrong to place us in a group because it would be unfair (we know all the answers so our groups would basically have an un-fair advantage) and then we played "Rocha Jeopardy" (the teacher is Ms. Rocha - hence Rocha Jeopardy.)  Well, we decided that I was going to be the caller-outter person (when they raise their numbers in the air signalling that they have an answer to the question on the screen, I write down their numbers in order) with Rebecca as the score keeper and the other girl as the right/wrong answer teller. We were a good team but I had the hardest job because they were screaming at me and harassing me if they felt I wasn't calling their numbers.  The last question is the one who really determined who won though. It was worth 50 points. So it killed the people who got it wrong and really helped the people who got it right (only two people got it right - one was already winning.)  What was really cool is that because I was a helper person who was running the game I automatically got 25 free points (the equivelant of what first place was). That makes it where I really dont even have to study for the final for tomorrow because it shouldn't hurt me even if I do terrible.  Before the class started I was looking at the grade sheet and I had a 103% and then the 25 points I got today probably put me at 107% or 109%. Maybe not that high, but it was pretty high.  So right now I think thats really awesome.  Need to go work on my site, http://togzone.com and respond to a bunch of e-mail. Peace out.

       Today I got up kinda late. I felt like being lazy again, but I still got on the bus in time to make my morning class. At 9:20 or something the 701 came and then I got to school by like 9:45 and just sat outside of my psychology class reading Black.  My review:  A thriller about the end of the world, Black ties in a lot of elements for a good book. It seems also to have indirect religious messages tied into the story, that would go over many people’s heads, but as a Christian I got them right away.  The book starts out where the main character, Thomas Hunter is being chased around an alley in Denver by loan sharks. One of the loan sharks shoots him in the head and it only makes a dent on his skull without actually hurting his brain. After taking the blow he starts to have these “dreams” of another world. One way in the future. And he learns that in 2010 there is a virus that wipes out everyone. Well, in his alternate reality or non-dream it is 2010, so the fight is on to stop this virus from being released.  Throughout the book, when Tom falls asleep in one reality he wakes up in the other reality, but the realities have no time correlation between each other. He could be in one reality for 15 years and then wake up in the other one and he was only asleep for 30 minutes.  I would recommend this book. Its not the best, and the end was disappointing (since it is a trilogy and the author wants to keep you reading) but all in all it was a fun book. It kept me turning the pages and I was able to finish it in two days. That’s pretty quick for a 400 page book while also in school. That tells you how exciting it was.   Well psychology was good today. This was our last day of actual instruction today. We went over psychological diseases and disfunctions such as bi-polar, syhizophrenia and depression. It was really interesting all things considered. And I got to see the cool people in my class again. Thank God for them. I would be losing my mind if I had to sit through the section 5 Psychology 101 class...really really would. Those people in there...geez. No wonder people from that class come to my class all the time. Between the helpless blonds, the steryotypical Abecrombie-God's-Gift-to-Women-and-the-world jocks to the lady who is inventing symptoms of pregnancy because she wants to be pregnant (tmi man...TMI!!)  Manny was also back today. He is a really awesome guy. I wish I was gonna be at SWC longer to I could get to know him better. I'm sure to him I'm this little kid or something but he is a really awesome guy. Hopefully I can get his contact info and we can hook-up outside of class. But that probably wont be a reality.  Today I got my grade for psychology. I am sitting at 94% before she added the extra credit. Today I got to drop a test that I didn't do too hot on and then I got to also apply my 25 points for perfect attendance. So that should get me back up to like 97% or maybe higher. So if I dont do to hot on the final shouldn't really affect me too much. I should definately still have an A in the class.  Now Mom is kicking me off because I "can't be trusted to get off" so cya. Ill add to this post later.

       Been crazy this week. I got the schedule for my Psychology Class and we're behind so the teacher is cramming in a lot of stuff. Final shouldn't be too bad though because its only 100 points and a regular test is 90 points...so if I totally bomb it (which is very unlikely - even without studying) I should still get out of the class with an A.  Today I slept in because I had some stomach bug thing and wanted to make sure I wasn't still sick so I attended the later class (wow are there some strange ones in that class.) Mental note to attend my regular class the rest of the week. Plus I have some friends in there (or at least acquaintences) that I want to say bye to since this is the last week and get phone numbers and stuff.  Mom has been keeping me off the net and today at school the net was down and then at my Dad's the power went out right when I turned the computer on...so I haven't been on the net in like 5 days... too long!  When I came on today I had a LOAD of email and then I have a lot of activity on TogZone to contend with too. But thats good. People are finally starting to use it without me having to IM them and harass them into it (well...at least SOME people are).  Been reading a lot. Which reminds me I need to update my site of what I'm currently reading. And then I went to the library and got more books today. The books of magic and something else. I want to read Diane Duane's series of young sourcerors or something too. Reading Black by Ted Dekker right now. Its a really cool thriller type thing.  Well - gotta go. Thought I should update so Chris doesn't kill me for not updating. So thurr be le update.  -Mb

       Met some really interesting internet people in the last couple of days. One, Tony, lives here in Chula Vista (I met his on this Church's website's forums when he offered me a ride to church) and we hit it off pretty well. He seems really awesome. We were gonna take a surfing class at SWC this fall, but the class was full...so I guess I dont get to do that.  I was bummed when I went to SWC to sign up for the class and it was booked. Then I tried to sign up for Human Sexuality, but that section (at night) that I wanted was full as well...so in the end I signed up for Social Psychology. It was $58 for the class since it was 3 units and then the text book (used) was $79. Lameness. Textbooks are so damn expensive.  Then also I met this awesome net person in the near past, Carrie. We totally connected, so much in fact she's already an Admin on my website (kinda wierd, but I feel like I can trust her even though I barely know her) and then recently I've met her Boyfriend, who I like as much if not more then her. They're awesome. I hope to meet both of them the next time I go to San Fransisco (they live about an hour 1/2 away, but thats a close central public place for us to meet and hang out.)  Also been talking to Isaac. He seems totally in love with this new girl he's dating. And he has me (indirectly) to thank for even getting to know her. I was going on and on about how crazy I was about this girl (and she doesn't like me in the least...oh well) so he got to know her, trying to help me get a date with her (but when I found out she doesn't like me, I thought "why bother") and through getting to know her to help me out he started having a crush on her and then asked her out. I think he's her first B/F too...not sure.  Right now we're getting ready to go on vacation up the coast. Its gonna be pretty awesome. I'll make sure I have some pics to post up here of the vacation. We're going up all the way to Pismo Beach which is 5 hours away, but we're stopping at various places along the way. Gonna be fun! Then staying at Pismo Beach a couple of days and coming back. But my Mom says we're stopping like at two points along the way, and staying the night, so it will be little like 1:30 hour chunks of travel time. I shouldn't get too bored.  Also, on BookCrossing I was just talking to this dude, who is gonna send me Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass (from Scotland) for free! I had no idea he was in Scotland. I feel totally bad now. Thats gonna be so expensive. I didn't even look at locations when I clicked on his name for the book.  And this other lady I'm trading for "Cause Caleb" by Helen Fielding for "Flowers in the Attic" by Virginia Andrews.  Right now need to get back to my convo and then on with some chores before I head out to bed.  I may be going to see The Bourne Supremacy tomorrow with Christian Cornier, if all goes well with both of our schedules. And then will probably be at the laundry mat late tomorrow night cuz the Rabbit pied in my Mom's bed (and I have to wash the comforters - since as the kid everything is my fault). So it should be fun.  And Illianna, Isaac's G/F was supposed to take this dance class with me, the Modern Dance one in the fall...but she hasn't come to get the papers...so it seems like its not her priority. I hope the class doesn't fill up and she doesn't get to take it. But I'm sure it already has...  So oh well.  Oh - also went to dinner tonight with my Mom and one of her friends from Work. It was cool, except that stayed there talking like 3 hours and I was bored to tears. But the Pizza was good. So I had something to do at least.  But yeah...need to get going. Peace.
