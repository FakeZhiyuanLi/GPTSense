      So.... here I am at 3:00 in the morning... after anothe wonderful shift in hell.... with only $60 to show for it...  That really sucks!  What the hell am I going to do?  I mean really????  I have three kids and NO money to speak of.  I'm going broke here.  I need help.  This is so fucking depressing...    I shake my ass for $4.00 a pop.  Not much cash-o-la.  No body is tipping me well because I don't do the "extras" so to speak.  :(  So sorry asshole.  For four fucking dollars, you get bare minimum!!!  Okay.  I'm done.

      All day long, my kids have driven me nuts.  I think they got together earlier in the day and decided that TODAY IS THE DAY TO DRIVE MOM BATTY...  Right now, the four year old is saying, over and over and over again... MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY....  I've went to him several times to see what he needs/wants and every time he just wanted me to go in there...  I've got my own stuff to do.  I've spent lots of time with him today...  Apparently this is just one of those days that he needs WAY more attention than I am even capable of giving him....  I try not to let him see that its driving me nuts though  LOL  I've spent the better part of my day scrubbing the walls from my waist down where those kids leave little hand prints and dirt tracks...  What fun!  Tomorrow is back to work in Hell... Oh, JOY!

      Okay, here I am...  3:30 in the morning and my mind is in high-gear.  I hate that!  Why is it that I am most productive in the wee hours of the morning???  I'm getting ready to take control of my life.  Starting up my SHE stuff ( http://www.flylady.net or http://www.shesintouch.com) again...  trying to get back on track.  I know how I am, if I am organized, I think better and my mood is WAY better... Typical Virgo behavior.    Then again, I am HERE... PROCRASTINATING!  LOL  How ironic is that?  Tomorrow (or is that later today), I WILL get my shit together.

      Here I am.  27 years old.  Single mom of three.  Working in a STRIP CLUB of all places.  I hate my life.  I love my children.  Those are the basic truths of my sucky, crappy, ICK! life.  So the question of the day (or night) is "where do I go from here?".  The answer is, "I DON"T FUCKING KNOW!"    I read "motivational" books.  It motivates me.  I do nothing.  I have these amazing bursts of energy and optimism and it all crumbles again.  I am left feeling empty and depressed (again).  I sit here in my messy house, laundry piled up, tv on, kids sleeping and I do NOTHING productive (unless you want to count working out my "mouse finger").  I am gaining weight I don't want.  Not fat but working on it.    What do I want?  I want to be safe and warm and happy.  Basic needs.  Harder to get than I thought.  Some say I should take my asshole ex-hubby to be back.  He wants me back.  I don't think so.  He can spend the rest of his life torturing someone else with his infantile whining.  I'd rather be homeless and hungry than be with HIM again.  'Nuff said!  LOL    What can I do to pull myself up from this hole?

      I've been wanting to start a blog for a while and just never got around to it.  Life is at a turning point right now and I have so many things running around in my head, I need to get them out.  A paper journal is not an option because of all the nosey people in my life.  HERE WE GO!!!

      Well, I've finally had enough of that stupid club I work at.  I just can't take it anymore and I'm quitting...  I'm going to be a distributor for Rainbow and make tons of money...  Still the house is a sty...   Must clean.
