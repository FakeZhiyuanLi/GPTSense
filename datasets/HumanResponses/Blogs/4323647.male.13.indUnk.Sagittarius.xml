       americas so  Monkeys Mansion. Were monkeys go to let off some steam. Were you can complain about   mewhat    crApY   goverment. Were you can youre imagination run wild       (i.e. Bob Doll not talking in third person and gee dub does).   Lets get things straight. I decided to start monkeys mansion when i finally got P-worded Off at   the fact that my school budget has always been a piece   CrAp ,  bush stil might have a  chance    of   winning (note I live in oregon), and lots of other reasons/topics(iraq, economy, stupidity, ect.)     My Alias is pulletboy because i like chickens. my favorite color is blue. and favorite game Black and White (not for religous people). Im in sixth grade and yes i do understand politics,note: most of my friends dont know what the word politics means or there smarter than, well, really smart people. I love birds (off topic) and my favorite type is the american kestrel .   Recently   I've noticed a little tention in the white house lately(just a little) and made this up for an example:   Scene:boy wathing t.v.     T.V. noises : bam kaaablooie baaaaaam!!!  BURN IN HELL SCUMBAG !!! Mom: how bloody and unage apropriat! here you go, somthing better changes to political debate, senoter 1: go  CHENNY  yourself senoter 2:  BURN IN HELL COMMIE !!!! Boy: you're right, this   IS   better!!!  Question of the day time!!!! we have top reportors look for are answers on(see begining of paragraph) Q:Mr. Bush, what's youre favorite color? Bush: Yes, i do like cheese.   I  hace made my point, welcome to monkeys mansion.
