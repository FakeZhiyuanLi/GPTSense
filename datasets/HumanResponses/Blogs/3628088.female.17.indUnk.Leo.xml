       have you ever noticed...  &nbsp; that the worst way to miss someone is when they are right beside you and yet you can never have them. and when the moment you can't feel them under your fingertips you miss them? &nbsp;  have you ever wondered...  &nbsp; which hurts the most; saying something you wished you hadn't or saying nothing and wishing you had?i guess the most important things are the hardest to say. they are the things you get ashamed of because words diminish them, words shrink things that seemed timeless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they are brought out. &nbsp;  don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.  &nbsp; if you do, they might break your heart, but if you don't, you might break theirs.have you ever decided not to become a couple because you were afraid of losing what you had with that person?your heart decides who it likes and who it doesn't. you can't tell your heart what to do. it does it on its own; when you least suspect it, or even when you dont want it to. &nbsp;  have you ever wanted to love someone with everything that you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  &nbsp; too many of us stay walled because we are too afraid to care too much, for fear that the other person does not care as much, or at all. &nbsp; have you ever loved someone and they had absolutely no idea whatsoever, or fell for your best friend in the entire world, and then sat around and watched him/her fall for someone else?have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle? &nbsp; we tell lies when we are afraid, afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us... &nbsp; ...but everytime we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger. &nbsp;  life is all about risks.  &nbsp; don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have had, or could have had. &nbsp;  no one waits forever...

      my head can't seem to comprehend this whole entire the world.. the naive views held by the teenage girls with their perfect lives, and their perfect homes, and their perfect boyfriends, and their perfect friends. well... meet me... someone who isn't perfect, meet someone who doesn't have a perfect family, meet someone who doesn't have a perfect boyfriend.. in fact doesn't have one at all.. meet the girl who has nothing even remotely perfect...truth is, all you have to do is step outside your house and take a look around... all the delusional minds and mystical illusions people create aren't enough to hide the truth..yet between false smiles and manufactured laughter... i can see the broken heart and the falling tears.. i can see your tragedy.. i can see the pain of being a teenage girl..  i guess sometimes i just want things to go good.. for a little while so everyone doesnt have to worry about any.. any of anything but having fun?? i guess i dont ask for things to be perfect just.. things to go peoples way sometimes... anyways new begginning of a new week.. hope everyone has a good one.. i guess when you think of it.. no one not one person really realy has a perfect life you know.. even when they seem to.. alot of people just judge whats on the outside.. when really.. your soppose to judge on the inside ... haha i have no idea what i'm talkign about btu i should gooooo ..... bye bye! love you  trisha just got here and scared the living crap out of me but um shes in the shower so i am sneaking in post its just sort of how i felt aaha.. anyway okay okay so wait i'll post up lyrics later i just want to put this part of the song on " and i finally found that life goes on without you ..and my world still turns when you're not around" ....yay for songs but hm haha its just sometimes i wish i could figure that out or feel like that.. i'm dumb bye bye

      it's amazing how much a book change change the way you look at things.. at.. life.. at least for the moment it feels really good.. and i just want to appoligize for earlier... i justhad a really bad break down and fell.. and i'm sorry that you had to hear it.. and sorry for being so selfish.. i guess.. i needed a reason to cry becuase i didn't want to cry over the things i have been crying or that has been in the back of my head that i barely talked about it to anyone or could bare to even think about it.. i guess finding out that my sister moved into my room just.. gave me a reason to cry about everything.. but if anyone asked.. it was just because of my room.. if that makes any sense.. and right now i'm just.. sort of.. spaced out.. thinking.. good but mostly bad.. i locked myself in my room today.. i guess im sorry if well i made anyone worry.. i seriously am in love with the perks of being a wall flower.. mainly .. because well it  has a really good point to it in the end.. and makes me realize alot of things.. alot of it was funny.. sad.. and well just all of it was great im really glad brett perry made me read it and im glad jess told me to.. i'm glad i have great friends.. i know i haven't written in a long while.. and i felt really good to just.. lay it on the table and .. honestly i wrote way to much today.. but it's okay... i guess i'm going to go down stairs now... i think i'm okay.. and well because i saw brett this morning.. i mean i really saw into him.. and how he was really serious and meant it when he said things were over... we'll see how things go from here.. maybe my life won't have as much roller coasters that i have to get on...  i wonder if what i do makes me who i am.. or how i think or do things.. makes me who i am.. i really don't know what makes me me.. i know that my friends and family help shape me to be who i am or who i am not.. i'm not exactly sure of anything at the moment but i'm okay i'm not crying i'm just.. i just am...

      they drove me to the air port.. hugged me.. and he said..  "be good down there alright punk don't come back TOO cowgirled out.." i laughed "i promise mr logan carter".. and he smiled.. "leave some of that surfer style in you..".. and i nodded my head "you promise right? cross your heart hope to die poke a 1000 needles in your eye".. he started laughing "i pinky promise".. and i meant it as much as i could "i'll be waiting for right here, we all will be" "you promise logan?" "you know it!".. and he said it like he meant it "give nicole a hug for me and tell her i said hi cowgirl, and your family to.. tell mike he's a fag" and he laughed hard.. "i will .. love you see you when i get back!!!"... *now boarding flight 156 to houston* and thats when he hugged me and i had to go...  and everyone eles hugged me and said things.. and he promised and i held him responsible for his promises kept...   . and now he's not even here to keep his promise.. and now i miss him..  .. just about one foot into boarding "call me when you get there punk i already miss you" and then they all said the same...  and that was it... that was all.. that was the last time..

      ... i don't know why.. i'm crying...  "because you left, because you chose to leave, because you left me you left us"      "but.. mom it's my room its the only thing i have to... i don't know" "you left it was your decision it was what you chose to do"      "you don't want me to go to college" "you could have stayed here now shut up you took everything and now your on your own and you can't turn back"       "i took what mom? i took my life!??!?! i had to go to college".. and i started crying...          " i don't want you to come and visit me.. not like you ever cared any way"  .........       "vivian what the hell thats my fucking room" "well your gone now"..  god.. i don't know what i'm crying my room was the ONLY thing that kept me sane when i went crazy or when things were just difficult it was the only thing i could stay in and close the door turn off the light shut my eyes close my blinds... shut the world out.. and pretend and and things would be okay.. it was MY room.. sorry if it meant that much to me.. but god.. i hate the fact that my sister is in it... maybe it's more of me knowing i have nothing to come back for.. and i don't.. mean that in a bad way.. it's because i know everything is going to change.. i know.. all my friends are giong to change ..they're.. not gonna be the same.. my family.. my sister my brother... they're all going to grow up.. and.. and so am i.. but am.. i wrong?? for wanted to come back to something that was constant and kept me content with my life?? maybe i'm just scared to change... or.. maybe i'm just crying because this is the only thing to cry about because i'm so scared for tk.. and i hate that logans gone.. i hate it... and i hate that everythings changing.. i mean i knew it was coming.. i knew i was going have to deal with everything but.. having to deal with mybest friend in the hopsitall... with.. losing ... GOSH DAMNIT FIFI STOP! i'm gonna stop crying now.. and.. i'm.. i'm gonan see the good in things.. i'm going to remind myself that things hapen for a reason and ... but... what good comes out of tk being in thehospital? what.. good comes out of logan... not being here.. it just hurts everyone.. NO i'm stopping i'm going to stop crying... everythings going to be okay.. they are.. and the fact that brettt doesn't love me anymore and he doesn't even care..... it's.. it's going to be okay... everyone eles is happy so i need to be happy or at least pretend.... i hate it.. my act and my.. smile seems to be and feel so artifical lately.. it scares me.. but i should be happy right? i'm not the one on the hopsitla bed i'm.. not the one that.. isn't here. i.. but that should have been me.. driving.. that should have been me in the coma... NO STOP make me stop i can't think like that.... maybe i'm just being stupid and crying for no reason.. everything just hurts.. i'm gonna go lay down.. i just want things to fade away right now.. the bad things.. the way my mom doens't care that i moved out.. they way that she thinks its my fault that ... i don't know.. the way that tk isn't doing well the way that logan isn't here to make me smile.. i'm.. i want it to go away.. sorry i didn't mean to break down on you... i'm sorry i'm such a screw up i'm sorry i'm not the best friend in the world or anythign near perfect...i'm sorry

      i.. reallly dont want to talk about it but i'm going to just.. well just.. i don't know i miss logan.. i miss him so much and how does .. someone that matters to you so much.. dissapear like that.. in .. a blink of an eye or.. a split second.. ha.. i can't talk about it any more.. im.. tired of crying....i can't stop.. tk.. that should have been me.. i.. ... i don't know.. i love you so much... um maybe some other day i'll be able to talk about all.. of well i don't know um summer came by.. and that made me feel soo much better.. i guess i should appoligize to her for crying the whole time.. but.. it just made me feel better.. at.. the time.. i just got off the phone with cole.. and.. for once it felt good to just get alot of things.. i guess off my mind it's been driving me .. insane.. and just.. i guess talking to someone.. i don't know.. makes it alot better.. and just talking about other things.. other than what i really have to deal with.. ((am i even making sense rigth now??)) even though i know its.. there and it's reality and its so real even though you don't want it to be.. and it.. sucks soo bad.. but sometimes i guess i shouldnt be doing this but it feels or make me feel better when i can just pretend.. and wish it never happened for.. just.. maybe a littl ebit.. even if its just .. an hour or two and have my worries on something eles that drives me completely insane but doesn't.. like completely hurt me as much as well dealing with um my best friend in the hospital becasue of me or a good friend.. um not being here any more ((am i seriously making any sense? i don't know but in my head it works out)) because having to deal with the things... that.. can completely change my life.. just... has me completely and.. absolutely drained... and.. it hurts.... soo bad.. okay now i really can't talk about it i don't want to cry...... but i'm so confused with me.. with my feelings.. what what and who i feel it for.. and if i even do? i don't know... i got to go dereks on the phone... if i make completely no sense... its just because my life right now is just.. taking me in turns and its taking me a while to realize what is happening...

      yeah... i'm just going to post a song.. and say that i miss tk.. she's going to be okay they tell me she's just resting.. derek and.. everyone is.. they need to know that tk's going to be fine.. theres nothing to worry about.. no more cry please guys.. you guys are scaring me... alot .. i talked to cole.. things are okay.. sometimes it seems to me as if i'm always the bad friend.. and doing things wrong.. never thought that.. it was something i had to work on... being a good friend.. i know i know i'm not the greatest friend a person can have but i try.. i honestly do sometimes i just don't know whatever to do.. i don't want or like to fight with my friends.. espcially the ones that means the most to me.. but anyway maybe i'll write another time about the weekend.. here's a song ((i know its hard to feel.. like i don't care at all.. where you are and how you feel.. with these lights off as these wheels. . keep rolling on and on slow things down or speed them up.. not enough or way too much.. how are you when i'm gone.. and i can't make it on my own.. because my heart is in ohio....so cut my wrist and black my eyes so i can fall asleep tonight or die.. because you kill me.. you know you do you kill me well.. you like it too and i can tell.. youll never stop until my final breath is gone.. spare me just hree last works i love you is all she heard.. i'll wait for you but i cna't wait forever)).. so yeah i really hurt but i'm trying not to show it.. i guess that goes both way phsycially i'm so sore..a nd mentally and emotionally i'm completely .. drained... to many things happen so fasst .. somethngs need not to be happeneing..
