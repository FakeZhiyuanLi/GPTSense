      Hey everyone,  My other bestest friend in the world wrote me. I got her letter today! I was really happy. It's nice to know that everyone cares! Well anyway I took my dog to the vet yesterday and everything went fine. She's doing great. I have a feeling my cat's pregnant, but I think they have to be a certain age. Becky if you're reading this what age is it? And how is&nbsp;Lil Bit&nbsp;and Sasha. Oh I have something for you to Becky:

      Hey Everyone, Yesterday was a great day for me. One of my best friends in the world:Mayra answered my e-mail. I miss all my friends so much, and since she responded, it gave me the little push that helped a lot. So thank you mayra. Love ya girl. Ok other then that I came to my home from Houston and I really missed my room and my animals a lot. But I'm okay now. I'm doing great other then that. Oh and last Sunday, my family and I tried out a new church. It was okay. Actually I liked it a lot. And I saw the new movie "Sleepover" It was AWESOME! I reccomend it to everyone. On Friday, my mom and my sis and I went to Humble just to get away for awhile. And we shopped. It was fun. The mall there is great. It's fun to get away from here every once in awhile, but I wouldnt change it for anything. Well, I guess I'll go now. But one more thing:"The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up."  urlLink  - urlLink Mark Twain &nbsp; I love that quote. Everyone should follow it. Love everyone and God Bless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Paige

      Ok, it's like 7:22 in the morning and I am online. I am an early riser and love fresh morning air. This is my second blog, and don't I seem more perky? Hehe. Ok, I'll start off by saying that my name is Paige. My mom got it from the nurses that delivered me because my mom wanted me to be a boy. Fortunately here&nbsp; I am.(as a girl) I'm 13 yrs. old and I live I think SouthEast TX. I prefer not to go into details about that subject though. I did, as a child grow up in Houston, but I currently moved to a smaller city. When I was 9, my parents divorced, and I am living with my mom and my step-dad mike. I come to see my dad in Houston once a month.(on wknds.) I have 2 sisters: Laci-19, Helena-17. I also have 2 older step-sisters. Pam and Lynn. Their husbands are Evan and James. They all have kids. I have 3 nieces, 3 nephews total. Youngest starting with A.J-2yrs, then Danielle-4yrs, then Jon-61/2(I think), then Ashlynn-7, then Lauren-12, then Randy-15. That's all of my family for right now.Ok, I love to Dance and Sing! If theres a good beat,watch out for Paige. She's dancing all over the place. LOL.I am a christian and I'm currently attending a Baptist Church. When I get Home to MY house, I'll be adding a pic. Right now I'm in Houston with my dad and older sister,Laci.So I guess that's all for now. Talk to everyone later. Love Everyone and God Bless.
