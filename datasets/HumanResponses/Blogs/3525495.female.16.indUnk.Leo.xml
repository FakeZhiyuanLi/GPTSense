      Are humans naturally good or evil? Many have argued over this topic for some time and have never come up with one answer. As for me, I used to try to believe that there some way to find the goodness in others. I hoped that when given the freedom people will choose the right thing. But who are we to say what is right and wrong. There are different rights and wrongs for everyone. And we shouldn't judge someone on what they feel is right. However, now at this time I feel that humans are naturally evil and curios. How do you feel?

      Is it bad for people to hang out with others older then them? Or is it normal? Does it help people learn how to be mature at a young age? Does that help? Or does that take away their childhood?

      This is the song/poem I wrote during 2nd period thinking of someone I lost and am trying to not care about, even though he still is trying to get attension. I hope you enjoy my wining.            "Song to Dan" Take what I say to heart To the grave When you say you meant every word you said While dead  While sleeping What I'm keeping from you will never come close to your ears Make it what you fear Never able to come close to here When you say When you scream at the top of your lungs 'I want to die' Is this the real reason why Never seem to try Make this your goodbye Your hello To the world To this unrelieable answer You never f**king ever said Make it so your dead Make them the understanding everlasting broken promises you made Make it the forever last breath The last thing you said to end this The everlasting kiss Of hatered Of lies Do you still want to die Do you still hear me underneath your pride Your broken lies You cry to never admit to your flaws Your failures Take what I say to heart To the grave When you say you meant every word you said While dead I know you do it on purpose  When you say 'Lose my number, lose my name.'  'Forget any memory you ever had of me' 'I don't want you to be everything you meant to me' And I know you lie You don't mean what you say You still love me You cry with the thought When you say goodbye Goodbye, I hope you die But I hate to say I hate you too Take what I say to heart To the grave When you say you meant every word you said Especially when you lied the words I love you.
