       feelings: Lame   song: Yellow Submarine (lame song from the beatles)&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  It was a terrible day in school. The design and technology lesson was the worst. We had to design a vanity mirror of our own. It was such a mess~!! I hate DNT. I think it is just one of the extra subjects that isn't important. It means nothing spending hours curving out shapes~~ Omg~~ It was last minute till then my group remembered that we still had a science project to do. Hmm... plan= Friends come to my house to do the project and later i hurry off to my barbeque?? YUpz.. sounds good!!~~   THe barbeque was indeed a messy and boring one, i just reached home like about 1/2 hour ago?? Yupzx~ hmm...its rather late for a 14 yrs old boy ya know. However my lastest was 1.30am. I went out with my friends to watch a soccer match. Well that was a excuse, my other friend, she invited me to her house, sad, i wasn't the only one to go.    =( haha.... jkjk.... Yawnz im tired... mY panda eyes coming out le...lol I am still feeling depressed, when will this feeling be gone?? Maybe I should do some soul searching.

       feelings:&nbsp;depressed song: Jian Chi Dao Di&nbsp; (Ah Du)  I have been watchin this series of show for rather many weeks, the title is 'jiu shi gu xiang', its about making wine. However it was like i just found out that this show is very weird and its getting rather confusing, not to the eyes but to the mind. The story is about a girl being forced to marry into a rich family, however the rich family had a son who is dead!! What the~~ Someone marrying to a dead person~~!! Weird yEh..! And out of the blue, the son of the rich family comes back~~ another BIG ? Well~~although it is a weird show, it tells us much about life which i find it very interesting.&nbsp;  Hmm... i am gonna have a barbeque tomorrow after school. It's not a class barbeque but a family babeque. Thats the big difference~~ with family, it;s rather boring in the sense you dont see fathers or mothers foolin around, playing around where there will be much fUN!! NAh stop the crap talk. Back to the topic, my mum asked me to call up some of my friends to join me but it's like last minute and it's after school, who would want to come~!! Haizx!! BAdly planned~~   I've been wondering why I have been feeling rather depressed lately. Of course not due to that crappy somg 'Gloomy Sunday' haha... look!! I can still joke~~lalala. Maybe it's just some personal matters of the heart. i've been rejected twice.. O.. That is like so SAD =( okok.. it's always that, whom u like mght not like you.. but whom you do not like, likes you.. haizx..   CONCLUSION: I will not give up!!!!~.~

       feelings: Gloomy   Song: Gloomy Sunday    yoz.. my friend of mine sent me this song 'Gloomy Sunday' yesterday and i found it a rather old fashion song. Although it was meant to be sad and depressing, I laughed to myself, how did 17 people commit suicide over this song. I mean~~ how depressing a song could get~~! LOl.. okok..   I had a terrible tuition this morning.. OMG I am a express student but i am losing out to those normal adcademic students. So depressing, That what ever topic the teacher taught us today, 'Mensuration' so 'quim', 'quim'= difficuit. That teacher explained rather clearly but i was still a little unsure about it. Maybe I didn't really paid attention, haizx... so stressful.. maybe i should quit tuition lol... BUt i seriously need it.. okok. tonight write somemore~~
