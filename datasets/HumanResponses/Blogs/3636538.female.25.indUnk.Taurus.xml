      To start off with, the shots weren't anywhere near as bad as the nurse on the phone made out.  Instead of having 8-10 shots i only ended up having two... typhoid and hep A.  What was really strange was the guy who'd told me about the travel doctor originally, back in nov last year was walking down queen st on my way back to the bus.  Bizzare.  So the shots are out of the way.  I need to sort out a medical kit.  I also need to hurry up and finish this damn course, lol.  I did two more assignments today and hopefully i can get the rest done tomorrow so i can send it off for marking.   I was talking to Tim today.  He said he didn't think i was the type to settle down, whatever that's supposed to mean.   I pointed out that i would be happy to settle down in a couple of years and he just laughed and said yeah right.  Grrrrr.  I think it's a load of bullshit bcos i know that i'm gonna settle down.  The thing is i do kinda like a guy but it's complicated and i kinda think that maybe i could settle down with him but i don't know.  How are you supposed to know that someone is right for you.  It doesn't make sense that i can think that right now bcos there's so much stuff to contend with but i kinda think maybe i do know.  ARGH. i don't know.  I guess there's no point doing my head in over it.  He's so far away dammit.  I shouldn't even be thinking about this kinda stuff about him right now bcos it's just pointless until i'm actually there or something.  Anyway.   I'd quite like to kiss him.  And dance with him, lol.   Anyway.   I've been eating a lot of chewing gum lately, not sure why.  That stupid travel doctor said that you don't see alot of dogs in china bcos as soon as someone sees one they nab it and put it in a pot.  Not something i needed to know.  Although i already knew, but cmon. Gross.  He has really nice lips.   The guy that is, not the doctor, lol.  I'm so glad they didn't do any shots in my ass.  And an amazing smile.  Ok i'll shut up. lol.  Um.  I'm dying for a coffee.  I started talking to Aram again.   I think i'll stop.   It really sucks when people have to go and ruin friendships over dumb shit.  I might go down to Taranaki before China.  Which would be pretty cool.   Catch up with a bunch of people i haven't seen in ages.  Hang out on the farm.  That kinda thing.  Could be fun.  Maybe even stop by the mountain and try snowboarding. I don't even know if there's snow down there. There must be bcos it's friggen cold up here. Oh well, i'll look into it.  Ok Aram sucks.  I told him what Tim says and he laughed and agreed with him.  He's just doing it to be an ass of course but still.  He sucks.  And not in a good way either.   I can't believe you passed out on me again, lol.  Oh well.  I was thinking that once i get settled in China i might get webcam.  Maybe. Seems like a good idea. We'll see.  I emailed a bunch of people i haven't talked to in ages about going to China.  Not sure why.  Dave, Mark, Frankie, Wy, Other Tim, and Peter.  Sometimes i do stuff and i really have no idea why.  I mean, it doesn't actually make any sense. Oh and Keith too. But yeah, i mean i don't really care if they know or not.  It doesn't make any difference if they do but i still let them know.  Weird.  I kinda worry about Ronin and Aniwa, bcos i'll be gone for awhile.  It seems weird, this is the first time i'll be away from the family.  And i'm probably gonna miss Sarahs new baby as well. Or babies. She might be having twins :)  She's the only one who's not excited about it, lol.  Aniwa isn't very happy either but i think she'll be fine and Ronin's really excited bcos it means more cousins for him. I really hope i make it back in time for the birth but i guess even just being here afterwards will be pretty cool.  I wonder what she's gonna name it.  Or them.  Aram is an ass. And not a good ass.  Ok i should think about bed.  For some reason i'm really tired.  I wish you were here.  Or i was there.  Or we were somewhere.  You really do have the nicest smile :) Dance with me.

      Was a blast, lol.  We went to dinner first which was really really good. (thanks christian).  I had rissoto for my entree, a pork cutlet (perfectly cooked) with parnisp mash(the shit) and fava beans.  Dessert was creme brulee with apple crumble icecream. I tried some of Christians black pudding too which, as much as i tried to like it, was just gross!!   So we decided we'd go to the Empire first and everyone could meet us after they finished work.  Only when we got there, the back was closed for a private function and in the front they were showing the Aussie/England game (england got their asses kicked :) and the whole place was packed.  So we got a drink, watched the end of the game and went outside to wait for Steph.  Steph and Carla turned up and we decided to go to the viaduct.  Txt Shane.   Got to degree and managed to get in before the lines started.  Went upstairs and started playing pool (carla is a shark).  Swapped sim cards with Steph cos her phone wasn't working and she had everyones numbers and we started txting everyone to get their asses here.  Txt Shane again.  Kylie, Jen and Anthea turned up with a new girl, can't remember her name.  That was funny.  Someone told Anthea to distract the guys we were playing so she goes up and starts grinding against this guys ass and then we point out to her that we're not actually playing him.  So then she does it to the guy we are playing who of course misses his shots and his mates are giving him shit for it, lol. Then Cheten and Jinu turned up so we started playing pool on the other table. (it was closer to the bar :p ) Txt Admir but he wasn't answering. Kylie, Jen and new girl were dancing together which looked so hardcase.  Anthea kept trying to dance with me or on my leg or something, lol.  So after we've had a few more drinks and Antheas tried to grind up against Cheten to distract him ( he just grinds back) only he sinks all his shots perfectly, lol, Steph, Jinu and i went down to the dance floor.  The music isn't too bad there but it was so packed and we kept getting elbowed.  Eventually everyone made it down to the floor and we danced and danced and danced and drank and danced. lol.  It's kinda funny dancing in a group bcos it really doesn't matter if you can't dance for shit, which some of them definately can't.  Christian got me a frangelico and coke which tastes really weird, almost chocolatly but i'd much rather have a jack and coke.  I keep getting hassled bcos i drink them like they're shots, lol.  Oh well. I think Anthea and new girl left around two or something and Christian and Carissa left around 2.30.  Steph poked me in the eye with her lindaur bottle when i was trying to see how much she had left which really realy hurt, so i took it off her and drank the rest lol. Not sure when Jinu left but we didn't end up leaving til 4.  Steph and i wanted to go to Provodore and keep dancing but she was kinda drunk and Cheten thought she should go home.  So they went and got something to eat and got a taxi and i walked to the bus stop.  This guy was walking next to me and he says, so did you have a good night.  I say yeah it was good.  He asks if i was out by myself so i say no, i was out with friends.  He asks with your bf? It occurs to me that he's hitting on me so i say yeah and he like oh ok, well have a good night and walks off.  Lol, weird.  Thought i'd catch the bus home but when i got to the bustop the next bus wasn't til 8.30am!!!!!!!! Screw that, lol.  I got a taxi. My new heels killed my feet.  There's more but i either can't remember it or don't wanna tell it so i think i'll leave it at that.  Got home and called Iffi.  Which might not have been the greatest idea cos i was very drunk and very horny.  I told him i love him.  Grrrrr.  Oh yeah.  We swapped our sim cards back but Steph kept putting the wrong code in so i couldn't use my phone.  When i checked it after i woke up, i've got a couple of txts from Shane from the night before asking where we were, lol.  He wants to go out before i leave so i guess we have to sort that out.  Stephs friend is coming on the 16th so if i'll still around i guess we'll do something then.

      The thing about mangoes is, they taste so much better when you can be messy eating them.  There's no fun and not really much point in eating them if you have to be all prim and proper and careful.   I think the best way is to eat them while you're in the bath.   They taste so much better when all your senses are involved and it's messy, indulgent, a greedy delight, almost sensuous... ...the way that you sink your teeth into it and take the first bite of ripe mango flesh and the juice drips down your chin and you don't have to worry about it because you're naked.  The exoticness of it, the steam rising, the way it feels in your hands, the way it smells, the way the taste lingers in your mouth and leaves you wanting more... and at the end of it all, when you're done eating it... licking every last drop off your fingers. Hmmmmmm.  It really is quite good. That being said, i feel like eating mangoes.....

      It's a beautiful day, cold but sunny.  I got woken up at 7.30 by the boys trying to play rugby in their room, lol. Grrrr.  Mum wants to go out this morning.  I don't know why yet.  Of course it could just be that she's trying to cram in as many mother/daughter moments in as possible before i go but i alwasy suspect an ulterior motive with her. Or maybe that is the ulterior motive? Anyway.  I need coffee, lol. Oh, one thing i did like about starbucks was the stuff they had on the walls, which was quite interesting to read while i waited, only they'd stuck a plant in front of it so i missed the last bit on one panal.  Their one redeeming factor i guess.  Iffi says he thinks NZ starbucks are bad and that it's better in the States.  I have my doubts but i suppose i should be fair and try it when i'm there.  But today it'll be atomic or icoco.  Either or.  That's one thing that sucks about selling the cafe.  Not being able to drink as much coffee as i like, whenever and however i want to. I can't get over how nice it is for a winters day.  I should be outside doing stuff.  Dunno what.  Maybe go for a drive out west or something.  I should go to the library too. I haven't read anything since Bone in the Throat, which was ok, not brilliant, although he can really describe food like whoa!  I need to sort out with Christian about sending me books in China.  I need to get a chinese phrasebook.  Argh. lol.  I guess i could always do it through amazon.  I smelt the most amazing candle yesterday.  Vanilla and coconut. Hmmm.

      I like the bit in Calvin and Hobbes where Calvin tries to implode.  I feel like screaming.  The new Asterix books aren't as good as the old ones.  I haven't read Tintin in ages.  Fat Freddys are playing tomorrow and i'm not going to get to see them.  But i'm going out drinking so it's ok.  I have toblerone.  That kinda sounds like a disease.  It's chocolate.  It's freezing here.  Well not really freezing but it's pretty damn cold.  I'd like to go to Paris.  And Italy.  And Morocco.  And Cuba.  Cuban cigars.  Hmmm.  No comment. I need to go to the library.  And the supermarket.  I need you.  I need a good cup of coffee.  Screw the budget, i'm getting a decent cup of coffee tomorrow.  I should get a dvd out.  I need to organise the bungy with Christian.  I should take some photos.  Not of the bungy, just in general.  I don't know why i'm typing like this.  Oh well.  What would be really really really good... is eating a mango right now.  Naked.  In the bath.  I should do a jigsaw.  I don't care if that makes me a nerd.  I wonder what kind of flowers they have in China.  And if they show rugby on tv.  How the hell am i going to watch the All Blacks.  I feel hungry.  I feel like getting high.  No i don't.  Yeah actually i do. I should go and see my sister.  I feel like dancing.  My niece is so cute.  My nephew is a brat.  And a wannabe thug.  But i love him.  Even though he's trying to talk me into buying him a pair of timberlands. Yeah right.  There is no way in hell i'm buying them.   Not bcos i don't want to.  They're just expensive.  Too expensive for a 12 yr old.  He'll get over it. I guess everyone will be getting bday presents from China this year.  Oh yeah, it'll be my first Christmas with snow.  That's gonna be cool.  I can make a snowman.  Lol.  Do 25 yr olds make snowmen? Does it matter if they don't cos i'm gonna do it anyway.  FRUSTRATED!!! I need... Lol.  Ok that's enough.  Bye.

      THE SHOTS: So yesterday i call the travel docter to see what shots i need before i go to China.  She said i should've have done this 6 weeks ago (tough, i'm doing it now).  She also said i need 10 or so shots(that is a shitload of shots).  And then she said it was gonna cost 500 bux(that is a shitload of money).  So on Tuesday i'm going to get 500bux worth of shots.  The only thing that really worries me is the shots in the ass. Not good, not good at all.  That and the 500 bux bit, bcos really, it is a shitload when you're kinda broke.  It's not that i'm scared of needles or anything cos i'm not in small amounts, but 10 seems kind of excessive.  Also, one of the diseases has something to do with the inflamtion of the brain.  Nasty.   THE STARBUCKS EPISODE: Starbucks sucks.  It sucks ass.  I went to get a coffee today bcos i haven't had one in two weeks (the broke thing again) and quite frankly i deserved a coffee, asked for a double shot and just a lil milk.  The dude says, oh we can't do that bcos we make our coffee with lots of milk. (That's so bullshit, bcos if you have a machine you can do what you like dumbass) I say ok look, i really just want a strong coffee with a little milk.  He says ohhhhhhhhhhhh, i can do you an americano.  I say cool, whatever man, just so long as it's strong.  He asks if i'd like 3 shots, i say sure, 3 is good.  And then he makes my coffee and he seems pleased with himself when he hands it to me and says it's nearly full up to the top.  IT TASTED LIKE FUCKING SHIT.  *sigh*  It was kinda like flavoured water that looked vaguely like shitty coffee and smelt vaguely like shitty coffee and tasted very much like shitty coffee only worse(that is possible) It was so bad i didn't drink it and now i'm pissed at starbucks bcos not only did it taste like shit but the guy filled it so full that i spilt it in my car.  ARGH!!  So yeah, starbucks is evil and i don't like them.  How this has become the largest coffee chain in the world i do not know.  Some people have no taste.   I guess i should apologise here if you're a starbucks fan..(no Iffi, you will never get me in there again, sorry)... my deepest sympathy, i hope you see the light some day :p  Ok, enough starbucks hating.   I'm all ready for tomorrow night :) I can't wait actually.  We're going for dinner at the restaurant and then a bunch of us are going drinking and dancing.  Sort of a farewell to me thing.  I need to get my assignments done by next week.   I sold the last of my cds that i'm not keeping today.  The hardest thing wasn't actually selling them this time.  It was walking out of the store without buying anymore bcos i saw the new beastie boys album and the misfits of science single and argh, it was hard, lol.  I wonder what the music stores are like there.  And the bookstores.  I heard it's hard to get hold of english lit. there.  I did see a basketball club in Beijing which would be cool.  I can't find anything about snowboarding at their ski fields, all the talk about is skiing.  I hear there are lots of starbucks. Grrrrrrrrrr. Ok i'll shut up about that.   I'm worried about the coffee though. And yes, i do appreciate the fact that i'm travelling to a foreign country and i should appreciate the natural cuisine and what they have to offer and not be too westernised and moan, but fuck, i love coffee and as much as i can survive without it, i don't want to, lol.  I guess i can always get stuff sent over if there's nothing good there.    I'm really looking forward to learning chinese cooking and going to the markets there.  And trying peking duck.  I know you can get it here, but i'd rather try it where it originated from.  I can't wait for the fruit either bcos there's bound to be stuff i've never tried before.  And fresh lychees. Yum.  It's not that long to go.  I haven't done half the stuff i need to.  I procrastinate way too much.   I can't wait for tomorrow :)  I wish you were here :(

      Even though i like caring, i think i care too much and you don't seem to care that i care at all.   Which basically just boils down to the fact that this whole thing is very frustrating and right now i don't feel like talking to you although I'm sure that'll pass cos i do really like talking to you. But right now... Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr You're impossible and i want to kick your ass.

      I read this on the back of a book about punctuation the other day, but I completely forgot about it until just now.  For some reason it came to mind and at the time it made me laugh, so even though it's kinda lame....  A panda walked into a cafe. He ordered a sandwich, ate it, then pulled out a gun and shot the waiter. 'Why?' groaned the injured man. The panda shrugged, tossed him a badly punctuated wildlife manual and walked out. And sure enough, when the waiter consulted the book, he found an explanation. 'Panda,' ran the entry for his assailant. 'Large black and white mammal native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.'  :)  Is it nerdy to use a colan and a right bracket to make a smile?  Or nerdy to wonder if it's nerdy?   Oh well.

      You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain And I find you spinning 'round in my brain Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne  You got to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise Like a summer with a thousand Julys' You intoxicate my soul with your eyes  Hmmmmm...

      They arrived late at night in a city they had never seen. It was hard to tell much from the windows of the taxi, but although everything about the lobby of the small hotel was unquestionably foreign, arriving there seemed oddly like coming home. They were too tired even to unpack, so they crawled into the high bed and fell asleep under a thick quilt. In the middle of the night he woke up to hear the sound of people singing as they walked by under the windows and he got up and opened the shutters slightly. Groups of people were strolling by, laughing and talking, coming home very late from dinner. He woke a second time, much later, to hear the sound of rain falling lightly in the street.  The next morning they opened their eyes to find that the room already was filled with barred light coming in through the shutters. A bowl of white flowers was on a table next to the bed and they could smell the closed, secret smell of the blossoms. She called for room service, speaking very slowly and clearly in her newly acquired language, then came back to bed. Both of them had drifted back to sleep by the time the knock came on the door. A young boy who seemed to have stepped out of a Renaissance painting came in carrying a tray of pastries and preserves...fresh orange juice and a pot of strong, hot coffee. They ate breakfast sitting up in bed, listening to the sounds of scooters and small cars and people calling out to one another on the other side of the shutters.  They had nothing to do for days - nothing except to be with each other, to read and write, to explore the city, to sit outside little trattorias in the sun. They both got out of bed and walked over to the high windows and out onto the small balcony. In the narrow, winding stonepaved street, the morning light made an intricate patteron of sun and shade on the cornices and lintels and pilasters of ancient, honey-coloured limestone buildings. The air had a fragrance that they couldn't quite identify, but after standing there a minute or two in the sunlight, they decided that it was a mixture of lemons, jasmine and espresso.

        Sitting here, hair wrapped up in a towel, thinking that i need to study, hoping that Someone will im me ;) and drinking coffee. This is kinda bizzare.  There's sun pouring into one side of the house, but on the other side of the house there's thunder and lightening... lol, that's Auckland weather for you.  Ok no, now it's just a thunderstorm all over, the first one this winter i think.  So much for going for a walk.    On the label of Roasted Addiqition coffee...  "If you're looking for Recommended Daily Intake information then you're out of luck. Insomniacs shouldn't touch this at all.  Long haul truck drivers on the other hand should double up.  Other than that, if you can't sleep at 4am because of our product don't come crying to us.  We ain't your mother."    That made me laugh this morning :)

      It's crazy.... Last month I turned 25, I wanted to be a chef, I thought I might do a chefs course and do a bit of travelling or something. This month I'm still 25 (duh!) but I'm about to head off to China to teach (hopefully Beijing) and I can't wait.  Ok so it's a little scary, new country, not knowing anyone, first time travelling alone and all that but it's sooooooooooo exciting.    Finished my TESOL course on Sunday which was great, learnt so much and now I'm just trying to work out which specialisation courses I'm going to do.  I'm thinking Children, Adults and Tutoring and mabye doing adolescents once I'm there, or something along those lines.   I've also started writing a bunch of lists as I'm prone to do, lol.  List 1. Things to do before I go... mundane stuff, farewell dinners, bungy, etc...      2. Things to buy... this one seems to have taken on a life of it's own...      3. Things to take... did you know they only let you take 20kgs of luggage.  20kgs!!!         It's hard to know what to take and what to leave behind.  I can't live without music and decent coffee and the teaching manual alone weighs something like 2.5kg.  I guess i'll just have to get someone to send me stuff over once I'm there.     So much to do and it seems like so little time (yes, i know how cliched that is, lol) Oh well 3 or 4 weeks to go til summer in China :)

      You have to love a lazy saturday.   Slept in and got up late.   Had breakfast then wandered down to Kommik for a paper and espresso.  I think they've changed hands bcos they've gone from using Icoco to using Sierra, which i'm not that thrilled about. Even though it's definately better than Icoco, it's still... Sierra, lol.  When i went on thursday the new barista put my short black in this tiny takeaway cup which seemed cute until i got to my car and had no where to put it and since i didn't want to drink it straightaway, ended up spilling it on my skirt while i was driving. Grrrr.  I guess it's just a good excuse to go to Atomic.  Lol, not that i need one. It's a rest day for the starter.  Went for a drive out to Bethels Beach with mum this afternoon.  I forget sometimes how great it is living in Auckland.  I mean, you start out in the city, drive through a couple of suburbs, then take a scenic route through 20 mins of native bush and you arrive at one of the nicest beaches on the west coast.  You've got just enough sun to take the chill out of the air, windswept black sand that sparkles, huge waves, that whole west coast wild and untameable look.  It was beautiful.   Saw this chick coming in from surfing.  She was about my age and i was so damn envious, lol.  Seeing her made me wanna surf real bad.  We stopped at Ollies place on the way home to pick up a whole heap of grapefruit and had a look at his renovations.   Hmm, grapefruit juice...   And then.... dun dun na... tonight....  the All Blacks kicked Springbok ass.  Woohoooooo.  Well, when i say kicked their ass, i mean they narrowly managed to score a try in the last 30 seconds to make it 23 - 21.  Very, VERY, nervewracking for a while there,lol.  We got 6 penalties, 5 by Daniel Carter and one by Carlos Spencer and a try from Dougie Howlett.  They got 3 converted tries, but they should've only gotten two.  The second one was off a forward pass and then the dude was shepereding and the ref didn't pick up on it.  He was a bit of a dick. And this guy does a high tackle, tries to tell the ref that he was falling which was so bullshit and then does it again, like a really blatent high tackle on Tana Umaga and the ref didn't even yellowcard him.  BULLSHIT!!!  They play pretty dirty.  And Percy Montgomery trying to throw punches on the ground when the ref isn't looking.  Good thing he punches like a girl so it didn't matter, lol. But... we still won :D   Oh and Joe Rokocoko.  DAMN!!! He can run man.  You see a bunch of guys chasing the ball and then you see him just pull in front from behind and wow. He's good.  You have to see him step too.  He steps pretty much better than anyone i've seen in a long time.  He'll step, spin, and still manage to pass the ball off without any hesitation.   There was a news article last week about the Prime Ministers motorcade breaking the speed limit so she could get to the game between the All Blacks and the Wallabies.  Which while i don't condone her speeding, is completely understandable.  After all it is NZ vs Aussie and it is the Tri Nations and it is the Bledisloe cup and we did really kick their ass.    So let me see.  We've kicked alot of ass this year.  England, Pacific Islanders, Aussie, South Africa, Argentina, ... have i missed anyone?  (yeah that's right, i'm gloating :)   Ok i'll stop.   cos i heard it on Base today... -can i kick it? to all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does before this, did you really know what live was? comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz gettin measures on the tip of the vibers rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug if you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug- a tribe called quest

Started the sourdough today.&nbsp; Well no, i started the starter today... organic rye flour and water.&nbsp; Left it out in the sun for an hour, brought it in an covered it with wrap and put it in the airing cupboard.&nbsp; :D  Lol, should i be this excited about bread?&nbsp; I am.&nbsp; Five days man.&nbsp; That seems so long to wait for bread.&nbsp; Anyway, it's looking pretty good i think, not really sure what it's supposed to look like but yeah, it looks pretty damn good.&nbsp;  I'm gonna do a ciabatta which takes two days and a foccacia which takes a day as well.&nbsp; And maybe honey and banana and maybe walnut and maybe... ok so i'm a little bread crazy right now.  &nbsp;  Been kinda depressed the last couple of days.&nbsp; Dunno why.&nbsp; I feel like fighting.&nbsp; Lol, boxing and fistacuffs and ass kicking and a lil rough and tumble.&nbsp; Bizzare.&nbsp; Some bugger stole my car.  I started writing a one year plan last night.&nbsp; I don't know that it was a productive thing to do.&nbsp; Not too specific or anything, except the list of stuff i want to do or try which seems to grow longer every time i write it.&nbsp; Which is probably a good indication that i need to stop writing the stuff and just do it.  And then there's the whole figuring out what i want to do with my life instead of jumping from one thing to the next in search of what i'm looking for.&nbsp; I mean i do have an idea.&nbsp; Lots of ideas.&nbsp; I know what i want, where i wanna be in a year, what i want to have done and be doing and all that, but the whole figuring&nbsp;out how to get there and achieve it all&nbsp;has me a little stumped.  &nbsp;  Last nights top five list of&nbsp;things i think are pretty important to me...  1. Happinees  2. Love  3.&nbsp;Friends and&nbsp;Family&nbsp;and all the stuff that goes with them.&nbsp; Or most of it.  4.&nbsp;Senses.&nbsp; (sensuality, sense of humour, sense of adventure, sense of direction...)  5. Freedom  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  with a sublist of...  1. coffee  2. music  3.&nbsp;chocolate  4. seasons  5. imagination  6. dancing  7. cooking  8. laughter  9. craziness and the ability to be a bit of an ass sometimes (in a good way of course)  10. and certain friends&nbsp; (but then that goes without saying) &nbsp;  Jurassic 5 is coming on the 1st of August.&nbsp; I really really wanna go see them but i kinda can't afford to which is just sad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually it's quite lame.&nbsp;&nbsp; Grrrr.  Ouu and i just heard The Roots have a new album out.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  -where I go I just dont know  i've got to got to gotta take it slow  when I find my piece of mind  i'm gonna give ya some of my good time  where i go i just don't know  i&nbsp;might end up somewhere in Mexico  when I find my piece of mind  i'm gonna keep it for the end of time-  red hot chili peppers&nbsp;

       It was a nice drive down. &nbsp;Stopped at Bosco in Te Kuiti for lunch, got to the farm around 4.30pm.&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole 3 days was pretty laid back, which was nice.&nbsp; Went on the farm a bit (walked through a couple of fields of mud on friday, got stuck numerous times, only just managed to not fall in), saw a field of deer, the two new bulls arive, the ten ginko trees arrive (they have acres and acres of land and they don't know where to put the ginkos!!!)&nbsp;Didn't get to milk any cows cos apparently it's not milking season.&nbsp;  &nbsp;     Got to talk to Ben which was cool bcos he's on the same wavelength food wise.&nbsp; Everyone's looking at us like we're mad cos we were going through the food he's cooking for the culinary competition and talking about food in general and getting crazy excited, lol.&nbsp;&nbsp; I promised to send recipes and cook books and my anthony bourdain books bcos i think he'll enjoy them.&nbsp; We stopped in at Urban, where he works on Saturday on the way home which was cool.&nbsp; Had this killer lemon custard pie thing that just melted in your mouth.&nbsp; Monica, the owner is an amazing cook, a homeopath and has her own olive grove in the South Island.&nbsp; She goes down there at harvest time, has a hand in pretty much the whole process and uses her oil, St Andrews Estate in the cafe.&nbsp; I was wowed, lol. &nbsp;&nbsp; They use Ozone coffee which is pretty good but not quite Atomic.&nbsp;&nbsp; We actually went to Ozone in New Plymouth when we did our cafe crawl a couple of years ago, which is where they have their cafe and roastery.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mind you, 3 days without a short black and pretty much anything would taste good.&nbsp;&nbsp; So yeah, it was a good trip, nice to catch up with everyone and say my goodbyes before i take off.&nbsp; I kinda wish i was gonna still be around to go and watch Ben at the competition and show him around all the foodie places in Auckland but i guess some other time.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's gonna be a kickass chef.  &nbsp;   Worked for mum this morning, we stopped at Huckleberry Farm on the way home to get some organic rye flour for my sourdough that i'm starting tomorrow :)&nbsp; I can't wait cos it's gonna be so good.&nbsp; There will be sourdough updates cos it takes 5 days to make, lol.&nbsp; Got some organic chocolate.&nbsp; It was supposedly belgian but tasted pretty shit.&nbsp; Not that i've tasted shit of course.&nbsp; And if shit tasted like organic chocolate... ok nm.&nbsp; Gross.&nbsp; lol.   Anyway, went to the place next door which is an organic cafe.&nbsp; Kinda interesting but expensive.&nbsp; Got a short black which was ok.&nbsp; I think the brand was kokako but i'm not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing to get excited about anyway.&nbsp; Which reminds me that tomorrow i'm going to walk down to Kommik or Atomic, not sure yet bcos Kommik is just down the road but Atomic is in Kingsland and that's kind of a hike right there.&nbsp; We'll see.&nbsp; Their coffee is kinda worth a hike.  Still studying.&nbsp; I need to get that finished.&nbsp; I need to go to China.&nbsp; I need to get a ticket.&nbsp; I need...  I did have more stuff to write but i've either forgotten it or i can't be assed.  Ollie's coming round for dinner.  I'm in the mood to bake  and dance  and listen to jazz  and some new nail polish i need some flowers in my room  and coffee  and chocolate  and dancing  and you&nbsp;:p  hmm  that would be nice.  &nbsp;  -i miss you like sleep  and there's nothing romantic about the hours I keep  the morning's when it starts  i&nbsp;don't look so sharp  now I got a heavy heart-  you am i

      Andrew came back from Papa New Guinea on tuesday and gave us some coffee he bought from a plantation over there.  Organic Coffee Paradiso Highlands Grown Arabica Coffee Medium Roast Filter Fine Ground  It's the best plunger coffee i've ever tasted.  Got up early today... 9.30am, lol, and rushed around doing a bunch off stuff.  Studied for a bit, sold the remaining cds, dvds, videos, playstation games and some jewellery which i hated and have no idea why i bought in the first place.  Also sold some clothes.  Well no, i didn't sell them, i took them to the place to be sold.  They told me i need to come back tomorrow to see what they want, which means waking up at 7am, catching a bus into town so i can be there when the store opens at 9am and find out what they want.  What pisses me off the most is that they're all labels and i already know they're gonna take them all.  Why they couldn't just sort it out today while i was there is beyond me.  It does give me a chance to have a coffee in town and pick up some last minute things before catching the bus back to be home for 10am so we can leave at 10.30am.  Why do i get the feeling that tomorrow morning is going to suck??? The good thing though is that i might have time to stop in at Real Groovy and pick up the new beastie boys cd :D Maybe.  Which reminds me, i need batteries.   About the mushroom salad.  I was thinking maybe some pinenuts and shaved romano might be nice with it.  I won't get a chance to try it out til next week though.  Hmmm.  Ok so i kinda had an arguement with someone yesterday.  No actually it was definately an arguement.  Anyway, i've been thinking about it quite alot since yesterday and i think they were probably right about a few things.  Not all mind you, just a few, lol. Which makes me think that maybe i need to stop worrying so much and just let things be and live a little.  Maybe.  I guess there's no harm in trying.  You know what would be cool?  If they had actually invented the beam me up scotty thing from star trek. Lol :p I'm a nerd.   Luke wants to go to Hawaii, so we're thinking that maybe after china... we'll do a trip together and then i'll travel on to the States from there.  Lol. I dunno, travelling with Luke??? Could be fun i guess and Hawaii would be nice.     Top five ben harper albums  1.Live from mars (2001)   With a sublist of top 10 songs from Live from mars. *1.sexual healing which follows into woman in you *2.faded/whole lotta love *3.glory and consequence *4.please bleed *5.walk away *6.ground on down *7.burn one down *8.another lonely day  *9.roses from a friend *10.the drugs don't work *#3 but it's an instrumental  2.Fight for your mind (1995) 3.Burn to shine (1999) 4.Welcome to the cruel world (1993) 5.Diamonds on the inside (2003)   Also 'The will to live' which is good but doesn't make it into the top 5.  I haven't heard Pleasure and Pain that he recorded with Tom Freund in 1992.  It's on vinyl only.  Limited Edition of 1,500 copies made. A rare album of covers and originals.   I want it, lol but it's very unlikely that i'll ever own it :( I also want 'Live at the hollywood bowl', any live EP with voodoo chile on and Toots and the Maytals 'True love' album which features Ben Harper and a bunch of other people on it.  That's not much to ask for is it?  Lol.   I read he's doing an album with the blind boys of alabama.  Interesting.   Ok it's kinda late so i guess i should probably get some sleep since i have to be up so friggen early, lol.  Gees, when did i start thinking that anything before 10am is early??? LAZY!  -could've sworn i heard you say amen amen this morning showing some kind of sign that you believe did it fall from your tongue without warning or just another just another trick to fall from your sleave did i hear you say that you believe in angels i guess i bring the devil out in you but we can both remove our halos cos even an angel needs love too even angels need love too  the woman in you is the worry  the worry in me  some things will never never never never never never change some things never stay the same but you're so  you're so innocent i'll take all the blame how i hate to remember for that means the day the day  the day has past sometimes i wonder if i know her or if i really need to ask or if i really need to ask  oh half a man  oh half a man half a man walks with no shadow of life he utters his distaste no apology is expected love carved sorry in his face love carved sorry in his face   the woman in you is the worry the worry in me- ben harper

      I'm thinking about food bcos i've been informed that i'm cooking lunch at the farm on friday.  I'm a little miserable about it bcos John, the father of the family doesn't eat garlic.  He doesn't even have garlic in the same room as him.  Onion, anything spicey or unusual, anything different and you can be pretty sure that you can't use it... it's heartbreaking.  And it's not like i can't cook something up without those ingredients but cmon... cooking with restrictions and especially those kind of restrictions just sucks.  I thought about doing a bacon and mango salad but i'm thinking it'll be too exotic.  I'm thinking about pear, walnut and feta but yeah, same goes.   So.... it looks like a very ordinary quiche, with a very ordinary salad, with some very ordinary cold cuts of meat (no salami!!) and some ordinary fresh bread.  Sigh.  I really wish people wouldn't volunteer me. Ok who am i kidding, i don't mind, lol.  I'm sure there'll be some intersting local produce i can use that'll keep everyone happy.  Just no garlic, or onion, or...    BACON AND MANGO SALAD  Mesclun Bacon, preferably streaky, as many rashes as you like, cooked til crisp. Break into small pieces when cool.  Use your fingers, trust me, its' better that way. Nuts. Anything soft like pecan, cashew, even almond flakes are good. If you're happy to not be an ass about it then cook them in the bacon fat, otherwise use pre roasted. Capsicums (or peppers, whatever you wanna call them), cut into thin strips. Cucumber, cut however you like. Tomatoes, chopped.  Grind salt and pepper on them before adding to the rest of the salad. Avocado, halved and sliced, salt and pepper. A ripe Mango, peeled, flesh cut off it, and cut into strips (and then it's very important that you eat the remaining flesh from the pip). Combine and eat.  DON'T use a dressing.  You won't need one.     PEAR AND WALNUT SALAD  Rocket, roasted walnuts, paper thin ribbons of pear and a good feta like Kapiti danish, crumbled.  Still undecided on a suitable dressing, but i did see one with french walnut oil (i've never seen that around anywhere) which looked kinda good.  I just made mine with a little sea salt, olive oil and red wine vinegar. Hmm, maybe a little bit of pear juice? Maybe not.   I was thinking about a rocket and mushroom salad.  With different kinds of mushrooms, drizzled with truffle oil.  Not sure what else. Still thinking on that one.   I feel like parsnip mash.  Parsnip mash is the shit.  If you haven't had parsnip mash you should bcos it's incredibly good.  Boiled parsnips, mashed, with butter, cream, salt, a little garlic and some wholegrain mustard added to it.  The Shit.  Enough of food for now.  Bedtime.   -sitting on a bench in the sunshine  filling up my belly with the fine wine- apollo 440

      We went to Atomic Roasters and it was perfect.  So perfect i only needed one, instead of the usual two.   A double shot espresso with just a drop of steamed milk, smooth and silky, a deep earthy brown crema just drifting on top... the first sip, which i think is the telling sip, when you lift the cup to your lips and let a little into your mouth and as soon as soon as it slides down your throat, it seems to seep into you, like an elixer is inhabiting your entire body, muscles you didn't even realise were tensed become relaxed instantly, you get this silly smile on your face and you let out a sigh bcos you know it's good, real good. And it's the perfect hotness.  Where if you wanted to, you could easily gulp the whole lot down at once and be left with nothing more than a warm glow in your belly... but then why would you want to?  So much better to make it last, savouring it til you're down to the dregs that coat the bottom, the tiniest amount of silken milk and dark crema that with one last sip slides down your throat as if it were a long awaited reward.  You finally relinquish your cup, placing it back down on the saucer and looking at it, you can just see the last hints of steam rising in swirls from its emptiness.   That's a good cup of coffee.  In Italy, or so i've been told, in the bigger cities they charge you for sitting down in a cafe, but not for standing at the counter to drink.  They have to make the coffee the right temperature for skulling for those who wish to stand and drink quickly.  I like that idea, even if the story isn't true, bcos it never made sense to me to get a coffee so hot that you have to wait for it to cool before you can drink it.  It seems to make the whole experience redundent.  I mean, if you're out with friends or family or a complete stranger for that matter and you're conversing over coffee and you happen to drink your coffee before you're ready to stop talking bcos you happen to have a really good cup of coffee that's been made properly, then the only thing to do is simply to get more coffee.  As much coffee as you need.  Til either your need to talk or your need for coffee is satiated, lol, whichever comes first...  You know when you're a kid and you watch grownups drinking coffee and you want it, not bcos you'll like it or bcos it tastes good but bcos you can't have it.  And they tell you that when you're old enough you'll be able to drink it.  That day that they deem you old enough seems to take forever to come around but finally it does and they let you have your first cup.  My first cup was instant coffee and it tasted like shit.  Only i didn't know that at the time.  It just seemed to me that it didn't quite live up to all the hype that'd been placed on it and definately wasn't worth what seemed like long drawn out years of longing for (but realisticly had not been that long bcos any period of waiting seems infinately longer as a kid) the forbidden drink. My very first espresso drink was a cappuccino at Solla Sollew in Mt Eden (which had walls covered in characters from dr seuss) with Sarah and Mum and i was in awe. I didn't know that coffee could taste so good.  It was milky with a mountain of froth on top, lots of brown sugar crystals and Sarah insisted we had to have it with cinnamon bcos that was the thing to do and it was beautiful.  I had it with a fat wedge of greek coconut cake which i've never had again but would still have to rate as one of the best cakes i've ever tasted.  It was perfect.   -when from a long-distant past nothing subsists,... still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistant, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection- michael proust  After coffee we went shopping.  I got a ZooYork jacket since we're definately going down to Taranaki on Thursday and it's gonne be friggen cold.  Way colder than up here, lol and all the complaining i've been doing about how cold it's been this winter will make Auckland seem like an island in the sun compared to that.  Basically i'll be freezing my ass off, lol.  We're leaving Thursday morning and coming back Saturday afternoon.  Haven't been on a long road trip in ages (it's 7 hrs, or a little over 6 with my driving, muahahaha) so i'm looking forward to it, specially stopping at Bosco in Te Kuiti and seeing Mt Ruapehu covered in snow.  Staying on the farm and catching up with everyone will be good too.  Iffi was trying to tell me this morning, not so successfully, that milking cows counts as beastiality since your pulling on what essentially is there breasts. ????  I think he's just hating on the whole cow milking thing cos he's lactose intolerent lol, jk.  :p   I'm trying to convince mum to take her car instead of Luke taking his bcos i want to drive so im playing on the whole, 'but it's my last chance to drive down country on a long trip before i go away and who knows when i'll be able to again' thing, lol.  We might take Amanda too, not sure yet.  It should be kinda fun anyway.   The turkish feast was soooooooooooooooooooo good.  Like crazy good.  There are certain foods which taste alot better when you use your hands to eat them and i think feasts, especially turkish feasts, are better suited to fingers than cutlery.   I dunno, maybe there's something remotely primal about it but it just seems to taste better when your scooping tabouleh onto a piece of warm pita and sinking your teeth into it, dipping meatballs and falafel into hummus and tzataki, picking up salad with your fingers, the whole process getting them messy so you have to lick them clean.  Then finishing it all off with a piece of delicious pistachio baklava.   Hmmmm.   The feeling of having eaten like a king.  Or at least a very favoured prince. lol.   ten jazz favourites  1. louis armstrong and oscar peterson - you go to my head 2. miles davis - it never entered my mind 3. lee morgan - since i fell for you 4. lou donaldson - potbelly 5. donald byrd - cantaloupe island (also us3's flip fantasia) 6. herbie hancock - watermelon man 7. duke ellington - mood indigo (also dr johns version) 8. peggy lee - fever 9. angelique kidjo - summertime (sexy french jazz...hmmmm) 10. les nubians - autour de minuit (more sexy french jazz) 11. Ok i know i said 10 but r.l. burnside gets a mention for 'too many ups' and 'hard time killing floor' even though he's actually blues bcos i'm not about to make a blues list but i like those songs.  12. And out of left field, jay-z - '1st song' cos it kinda has a bluesy backing to it although, lol, i realise that has nothing to do with favourite jazz. oh well, while i'm mentioning it i guess i should mention 'lucifer' from jay-z too cos it's a good song and i like it. "lucifer son of the morning, i'm gonna chase you outa earth"  13. A bunch of latin jazz which i have no idea who sings it or what it's called but it's good. Stuff that makes you wanna sway your hips :)  five albums i wouldn't mind owning 1. beastie boys - to the 5 boroughs  OR  jurassic 5 - quality control 2. fat freddys drop when it comes out  OR  verse two if it ever comes out  3.minuit - the 88  OR  concord dawn - uprising 4. kanye west - college dropout  OR  souls of mischief  OR  N.E.R.D - fly or die  OR  DMX 5.franz ferdinand - franz ferdinand  OR  kings of leon - youth and young manhood  OR  tool - lateralus  OR  sublime - sublime   huh, that's not 5.  i need to stop with the lists. But most of all... beastie boys  -autour de minuit je donne parfois rancard a ma bonne étoile la plus belle des stars cette étoile au baiser d'azur- les nubians

      You came in with the breeze... on sunday morning...  I always think of that song when sunday rolls round, lol.  The house is filled with the smell of lamb cooking and of rosemary and the jasmine, old roses and fresias (which i think i've spelt wrong) that i picked yesterday. Hmmmm. It's a beautiful day, there's no clouds that i can see and it feels vaguely like a late spring afternoon instead of a mid winter one.  All is good with my world...  Ok so yesterday was um, interesting, for me at least.  Sarah arrived just before midday with Fred and Aniwa.  She's so cute.  You ask her to tell you about Dora the Explorer and she becomes so animated and acts everything out.  So full of energy, kinda hard to believe she's gonna be 3 in December.  I told her we should go sit out in the sun and she said 'oh no auntie... it's too hot' I told her it wasnt hot at all, it was warm and just right so we went outside and walked around the house looking at flowers and the lemon tree and she said 'it's nice and warm in the sun auntie' lol.  I got lots of kisses and hugs and 'i love you aunties' :)  She's obsessed with castles and building castles out of blocks and telling you that the witch lives upstairs and the dragon lives downstairs.   Fred talked alot about their tribe, their land, about old stories and ways of life, which could be boring if told by anyone else but the way he relates it makes it intersting and you can't help but listen and be intrigued.  I think it's his sense of humour and modern perspective on old things that does it.  They stayed for lunch and then left for Coromandal just before 3pm.  I went up to the library for some books, found 3, none of which i'd gone for but seeing as i couldn't find the books that i did want, i got them.  Two suck.  They suck shit, lol. I read the first couple of chapters of both and couldn't stay focused.  So i tried the 3rd which is called 'The Family Orchard' and which im' 2/3 of the way through.  It's not that it's a great novel, but that it's not a bad one.  I did start reading Much Ado About Nothing the night before which i guess i'll go back to reading after i'm done with this, but it's one of those things where you know the story and you know the outcome so it's not really that gripping, but still an ok read.  Have you ever noticed how intricatly some people fold the corners of book pages?  I swear it could almost be considered an art.  Maybe. Saturday night... Everyone else was out and i was home alone.  Kinda bored so i thought i'd go and get a dvd.  Get home and i thought i could smell a candle burning and i was pretty sure i hadn't lit any.  Walk in the front door and look in the living room and i can see glowing embers in the basket where we keep the firewood... not a good sight!!  Luke had put the ashes from the fire the night before into a plastic bag and then in the basket and there were still embers, from the pinecones i think bcos they burn quite long.  So i got as much as i could back into the fireplace, the paper in the basket was starting to catch fire so i stamped that out and then took the basket outside and poured water over it.  There were quite a few moments of panic, lol.  It was a good thing i went out though bcos my room is upstairs and if the stuff had caught on fire i would've been oblivious to it til it was too late.  And seeing as my room is kind of over the living room i don't know that i would've been able to jump out of the window either.  Scary thought.  Then...  yeah, it doesn't end there...  I was walking down the stairs to talk to the boys about the near fire thing since it was their fault for putting the embers in the basket in the first place and i slipped on one of the steps, ended up with one leg underneath me with my weight on it.  Somehow managed not to fall the rest of the way down the steps but fuck, it hurt.  I thought it was broken at first bcos i had no feeling in my toes but then i could feel them and they hurt like hell and my shin was starting to bruise and as is the norm when i'm in pain and don't think i should be i started to shake and couldn't breathe.  So my mum who is usually hopeless with these kinda things sat my in front of the heater, gave me a lolly like a good nurse, lol, bcos i was in shock she said and put cold flannels on my leg and eventually it didn't hurt as much.  She said she'd been talking to Luke earlier in the day and he had said he didn't want me to go to China.  She said to China or you just don't want her to leave and he said both and that he'd miss me which was kinda sweet of him.  I think of all my brothers, (i have 4 and 1 sister) he's my favourite.  He's the younger twin by 8 mins (which John always loves to point out) but he really always was kinda the baby of the family.   Tomorrow is my first day of coffee in two weeks.  I've become addicted to vanilla tea but it doesn't begin to compare to coffee, lol.  I'm craving it.  I'm fiending for it.  I'm counting down the hours.  I'm still trying to decide where would be the best place to get my fix, lol.  I'm thinking somewhere in Ponsonby or Atomic Roasters in Kingsland or that new french place on Mt Eden Rd.  No, probably not the new french place.  It has to be good.  I don't want mediocre coffee that leaves me wishing i'd gone somewhere else for it.  I want a cup that when i take the first sip, my whole body relaxes and i feel like i'm doing what i'm what i'm supposed to and it tastes smooth and dark and good.     'on saturday mornings i would walk to the flavour cup or porto rico importing coffee store to get my coffee.  Often it was freshly roasted and the beans were still warm.  Coffee was my nectar and my ambrosia' from espresso.  I've loved cooking feasts since i was 14.  I would invite 20 or 30 people round and my table would be spread like a banquet, overflowing with food.  After dinner i'd serve coffee and good quality chocolates and we'd sit around til late, talking and laughing.  Tomorrow night is my turkish feast night.  Haven't had a feast in ages and I feel like one tomorrow.  Of course it's gonna be on a much less grander scale than my old feasts, but it'll be a feast none the less.  Tabouleh, falafel, couscous, tzataki, lamb meatballs, pita bread, hummus, chickpea salad, turkish lamb followed by baklava and apple tea.  Which reminds me that i need to go to the Lebanese store tomorrow.   - Tumba palo cocuye!   Conozco bien ese palo porque palo bueno es!

      So we went out for a cup of tea.  The place had changed hands so it wasn't anywhere near as good as it should've been but we stayed there anyway.  Vanilla tea for two.  The actual place is called Tea Total (www.teatotal.co.nz) and is now in Milford instead of Mt Eden. It wasn't all bad though bcos i got to check out my favourite bookstore (can i say it's my favourite bookstore even though this is only the second time i've been there?) Cook the Books which is like heaven. (www.cookthebooks.co.nz) They only sell cookbooks and books that are food related and i can see that this is where i'll be getting Christian to get me books from when i'm in China.  They have the largest range of culinary fiction i've ever seen.  We alos stopped in at The Grocer which smelt really really good and I was tempted to buy the fig and walnut log but i resisted.  Then we went to Huckleberry Farm which is an organics store.  It was funny bcos we saw an old customer from the cafe who we called 'turban lady'(she's an old white woman who wears a kind of turban thing on her head) and we really didn't want to talk to her bcos she has quite bad breath and you can't breathe round her.  So we were trying to avoid her and we thought she'd gone so we'd turn to walk down an aisle and there she was and we'd hurry into another one.  It was quite childish really, lol.    In a very high fidelityish way, here's 5 top 5 lists...   top five songs right this minute... 1. Bob Marley - Is This Love 2. Franz Ferdinand - Take Me Out 3. Kings of Leon - Red Morning Light 4. Jimi Hendrix - Crosstown Traffic 5. Ice Cube - It Was a Good Day  On second thoughts... better make it ten for good measure... 6. Nathan Haines - Squire For Hire 7.Twista - Overnight Celebrity (for the music, the beat the bit the chick does and the fact that he rhymes so damn fast, not the lyrics,)  8. A Tribe Called Quest - Can I Kick It 9. Black Eyed Peas - Lets Get Retarded (they actually changed it to Lets Get Started on radio stations here to be more user friendly.  Can you get any more politically correct than that?) 10. Rage Against the Machine - Bullet in the Head  Do you remember the song about the cows? From the nineties.  Cows with guns?  I haven't heard that in ages.  Dunno what made me  think of it.   Top 5 Auckland Radio Stations... (in no particular order) 1. base fm (basefm.co.nz) 2. 95bfm (95bfm.co.nz) 3. george fm (georgefm.co.nz) 4. channel z (channelz.co.nz) 5. mai fm (maifm.co.nz)  Top 5 magazines... 1. Vogue Entertaining + Travel 2. Cafe 3. Staple 4. Pavement 5. Manual  Top 5 things i wanna do that i haven't done yet... 1. Surf 2. Snowboard 3. Play drums and base (the respective instruments, not as in DnB) 4. Learn Spanish or Italian 5. Get a tattoo (not just for the sake of it, i want something beautiful and intricate that means something to me, or two or three ;)  better make this one 10 as well... 6. Salsa 7. Bungy 8. Flying (as in small planes, not the jumping off from any available thing of height as a kid, flapping your arms like mad and hoping you'd actually fly) 9. Going to the Tomatina festival and or the running of the bulls in spain.  (i'd settle for a san sebastian tapas bar crawl though) 10. Metallica concert. Or Ben Harper. Or beastie boys. Or..., lol.  Argh!!! 15 :) 11. Sky Diving 12. Eating at the French Laundry (i would die) 13. Eating at Les Halles 14. Road Trip (ok yeah, so i've been on my fair share but i wanna do a decent one) 15. Driving a Dodge Viper  Top 5 countries to go to... 1. The States (for obvious reasons) 2. Cuba or Jamaica 3. Mexico 4. Italy, Spain or Portugal 5. Morocco  with a sublist of top 5 cities... 1. New Orleans 2. New York 3. Paris 4. Havana 5. San Diego... should that have been number one? :p   Blooody hell.  5 top 5 lists.  This is ridiculous, what am i thinking??? I think i'm bored...  Wait, one more.  I promise this is the last one...  Top 5 shakespeare plays made into movies that made me actually like shakespeare...(in order) 1. Much ado about nothing - so funny 2. Midsummers nights dream - the movie, although the night theatre play i saw performed by students under the clock tower at the auckland uni was alot better.  3. The taming of the shrew - which was the movie 10 things i hate about you. 4. Romeo and Juliet - directed by baz luhrman. It would be #3 but i'm not really a fan of Leo.  5. The Twelfth Night - If i had seen Looking for Richard, with Al Pacino i would've put that bcos this wasn't actually that great of a movie but i needed a 5th and there's no way in hell i'm gonna put Shakespeare in Love.   Ok that's enough lists for today.  -lights out  guerilla radio  turn that shit up- rage against the machine

      More like a tuesday or wednesday.  I don't think you apprectiate the weekends as much when you're not working bcos they're really no different than any other day so it's hard to get excited about the fact that it's friday and tomorrow is the weekend.  Or something like that, lol.  Tuesday night was good.  Leigh and Sepa and their kids ended up coming round as well.   For dinner i did roasted vege (potato, kumera, butternut, parsnip, onion, red and yellow peppers with maldon sea salt, basil and smashed garlic, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil), a leg of lamb (rubbed in olive oil, rosemary and maldon sea salt), cauliflower mash, warm salad (mesculin, tomato, mushroom, zuchinni, red onion, cashews with garlic and cumin feta) and fresh bread.  Sepa did a roast chicken as well. Not bad.  For some reason my room is a magnet for kids.  That sounds wrong, bcos it's not like my room is set up for kids or anything, they just like hanging there.  All i have is a bed, bedside cabinet, record player, desk, chair and pc, chest of drawers, bookshelf, rocking chair (not mine), a cupboard full of stuff i either don't need right now or don't know what to do with, a mirror, two cd racks and various other bits and pieces.  On the walls i've got surf pics, a framed picture of a sunset on the west coast, some coffee art, a piece of tapa cloth and a replete food co. flax bag that i picked up at Replete in Taupo on a cafe crawl a couple of years ago.  So yeah, nothing too exciting, but they all ended up in my room anyway.  It was kinda fun.  The thing with Amanda and Josiah was funny. Made friends with Claudia, Leighs youngest girl who's 5.  She said, Rachel, i'm going to write my number down for you and you can call me in the morning. Lol. I said why don't i give you mine and you call me.  So she did.  We talked about dolls and shopping and going to the park and how her favourtie colours are yellow, light green, red, pink, purple and orange.  She doesn't like dark green.  Talked to Frankie which was a little weird seeing as i haven't spoken to him for 6 months, maybe longer.  He's still the same.    Wednesday we went pine cone picking in Woodhill Forrest which was kinda fun.  I haven't done anything like that since i was a kid when we used to do stuff like that all the time.  They have a mountain bike track right through the forrest which looks like a lot of fun.  Maybe when i come back...  Then we went out to Murawai even though it was pouring with rain and there was a thunderstorm and hail.  I was the only one who still wanted to go for a walk on the beach, but we did all get out and walk along to the blow hole.  It's a wide expanse of flattish rock jutting out from the side of the cliff and to one side there's a big hole.  When the waves crash against the rocks with enough force, water comes up from underneath and out the hole, spreading across the rock.  It's fascinating to watch, even in the rain on a wild day.  We saw some fisherman and a couple of surfers.  The water must've been cold as but the waves seemed pretty good.   Yesterday was uneventful.  Got an email from Phebes who went snowboarding on the first day of the season.  Hannah went with her but it was her first time which kinda suprised me, i would've thought she'd be really into it.  Lol, Hannah who when we were kids could climb to the top of a tree, no matter the height, faster than any other kid, boy or girl. Haven't seen her in ages.  I keep thinking i should before i go but i dunno, it'd be weird.  We used to be best friends when we were younger.  Then stuff happened and we weren't around each other anymore and i guess everything just changed.  Did some reading, a little grocery shopping, listened to music. If i was staying i would expand my record collection.  Real Groovy and Beat Merchents have some really good stuff.  I saw this tiny little record store last week, tucked in the canturbury arcade between high st and queen.  Looked interesting but i didn't get a chance to go in.  Watched High Fidelity again which i guess is why i'm thinking of records. I like Jack Black in that, the elitist record store worker, lol. Which reminds me, Fat Freddys Drop are supposed to be releasing their album soon.  I have hope and bluey on vinyl and the cover art for it is pretty cool.  Which also reminds me that i haven't checked out that sticker site in ages.  It's this thing where instead of doing graffiti you do stickers.  Some of them are pretty good.  There's this one chick in NY who does realy amazing ones, very intricate and time consuming.   www.stickernation.net  I woke up late today.  Late as in noon, lol.  So the plan now is to go to Huckleberry Farm, Tea Total (which i'd forgotten about until Iffi said he'd gone to a tea place that had a menu 10 pages long!!!) and study.  Which will hopefully end soon.   I feel like going for a drive.  I think that if Sarah doesn't turn up tomorrow, i'll go out to Bethels.   -cos the whole wide world's rock n roll to me-  verse two

      Lisa Bonet singing this in high fidelity... it's pretty wow.   Shadows grow so long before my eyes  And they're moving across the page  Suddenly the day turns into night  Far away from the city  But don't hesitate 'cuz your love won't wait  Ooh baby I love your way (everyday)  Wanna tell you I love your way  Wanna be with you night and day  Moon appears to shine and light the sky  With the help of some fireflies  I wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine  I can see them under the pine  But don't hesitate'cuz your love won't wait  Ooh baby I love your way (everyday)  Wanna tell you I love your way  Wanna be with you night and day  But don't hesitate'cuz your love won't wait  I can see the sunset in your eyes  Brown and grey and blue besides  Clouds are stalking islands in the sun  I wish I could buy one out of season  But don't hesitate'cuz your love won't wait  Ooh baby I love your way (everyday)  Wanna tell you I love your way  Wanna be with you night and day  Ooh baby I love your way (everyday)  Wanna tell you I love your way  Wanna be with you night and day

      We didn't end up going pinecone picking even though it was a nicish day.  I think it's just one of those days where you wake up full of good intentions but then it hits you that it's saturday and you really can do what you damn well like instead of herding out to the westcoast and going for a walk on the beach and getting loads of pinecones for your fire.  Lol, sounds like hard work now that i think of it, but it would've been nice.  Ronin lost his League game but he's happy bcos he got a try.  His Union game was cancelled so he's asleep on the couch after coming home and complaining that he's starving and there's no food.  Lol, so lazy.  Actually before he hit the couch we were playing this really dumb but kind of addictive hit the penguin game on here where you're a polar bear and you have to hit a penguin that's jumped off a cliff and see how far you can get him.  Kinda dumb. I miss parties at Ollies house.  I miss dancing to Bob and dub and downbeat and roots.  And good food and beer and playing tekken 3 on the projector.  Fun times.  I think i need to cut my hair.  Or get highlights. Or something. Haven't decided yet.  Actually i've noticed that i've been undecided about alot of things lately and putting things off and stuff. Not good.  I miss you. I feel like reading too.  Anything except my teaching manual that is, lol.  I will read it today though and take notes like a good student.  And then hopefully finsih my assignments tomorrow. Lol, hmm, i seem to remember saying that before.  Sarah, Fred and Aniwa were going to come up on Monday but now they're not which sucks. Wendy and the kids are coming round for dinner on tuesday night seeing as Andrew is in Papa New Guinea.  I told her we were having tofu and vegetables for dinner and she was trying to be very polite and tell me that she'd had tofu once in pad thai and it had been quite nice.  This said with a very obvious worried look on her face, lol.  Cmon man, i wouldn't do that to you.  Or would I... Muahahaha. (sorry to all you tofu lovers) I'm eating too much chewing gum.  I have 11 packets!!! well no 10 bcos i finished one this morning.   Found this surf camp that i might go to when i come back home from China. http://www.surfcoaching.com The thing is i'm probably only gonna be back home for a month or so before i start travelling again and i have quite a bit to fit in.  Like family dinners and going out with friends and spending time with Sarah and the new baby/babies.  But it would be really cool to take Ronin as a kind of very very late bday present and get to spend some time with him before i take off again.  I kinda worry bcos he's turning into a wannabe thug and he's only 12.  I need to go and see Kat and her new baby sometime next week or the outfit i got for Sara isn't gonna fit anymore, lol.   I went to the cemetry where dad was buried on monday.  I don't know why really bcos it's kind of a dumb thing to do.  I mean i know he's not there but i thought it was probably my last chance to go before i leave.  It's quite a big cemetry and you've got to drive some way to get to the part where he was buried so i finally get there and there's a burial going on and cars blocking the road and i really just couldn't be bothered walking in the rain to try and find it so i turned around and went home.  I'm not sure that it's such a bad thing though.  Maybe i'm past it. Which would be really good.  I don't know, i didn't really feel anything except for being slightly pissed off at the people who'd parked side by side on a narrow road so noone else could get past.  Which is probably uncharitable but still.  I wonder if i should take a photo of him with me to China.  Now that i think about it i'm really not thinking about him as much.  Maybe bcos i'm so happy right now.  Well, for the most part.  No, i am happy. Confused but happy, lol.  I know what i want i just have to figure out how to get it.  I think my biggest problem right now is that i want to go out and buy all the ingredients, bake the cake and eat it too.  And it's a fancy cake at that.  Is it weird that i thought about going to my dads grave, but i don't want to go to my grandparents graves, even though i spent alot more time with them than i did with him? I suppose it isn't.  Shit. Ok.  It's saturday and i'm sitting here writing, lol.  I need to go out and do something.  Later.   - i'll play your fav'rite song, darlin' We can rock it all night long, darlin' 'Cause I've got love, darlin' Love, sweet love, darlin' Mellow mood has got me So let the music rock me - bob marley  I feel like dancing to reggae  Don't laugh, i dance good to reggae :)

      Like how much i'm loving omlettes right now.  lol.  Probably sounds dumb but they're really good... you should try them.  I had one on my last day in Singapore at one of the hawker centres.  Mushroom and chicken and it was really good.  Hmm and then there was this shop brimming with all sorts of things made from coconut *drools* which is my favourite thing after mangoes in that line of things.  Man.  That was so long ago.  That was such a weird trip.  Weird but cool.   Also thinking about getting the top of my ear repierced.  But i might wait til i come back from china.  Not sure.  I'm thinking i shouldn't have sold my rage cd bcos i feel like doing a bit of headbanging.   I dunno.  I'm thinking a bunch of things right now. Related or otherwise.  I'm thinking alot about china.  And about someone.  And about doing stuff.   Jackie and Maureena want to come round for dinner before i go.  I don't know why.  I haven't talked to them in at least 3 yrs and they wanna come and see me.  Argh.  How do you go from hanging out with people all the time to never seeing them anymore and just expect to waltz back in.  It's not that they aren't nice people but i just really can't be bothered with them bcos things are so different now from how they used to be.  It's weird how when you're growing up you think you'll be friends forever and then gradually you drift apart and you get your own lives and you don't have so much in common anymore.   I think it would be nice to start over.  Where noone knows you.  And you can just do what you like and not have to worry that it's gonna get talked about or at least not by anyone you know.  Where noone has a preconceived idea of you and how you should act and what you should like and all that shit.   No, i'm not running away to China, although i guess it might look like that but it's not really.  Or maybe it is.  I don't know.  I don't think i am but it has all the elements of it doesn't it?  I guess i just want change and i don't think i'm gonna get it here and i want to be able to travel and work and see the world.  And i'm thinking that if for some reason i found myself wanting to move to certain places then at least with this up my sleave i'd have a job. or a blob. or a mob. Ok i'm being an ass.   I'm at the point where i want all the freedom i've never had and i want it right now.  But then i'm also a lil lonely and it would be nice to have someone.  Not just anyone though, lol. I want to get away from my family but know that they're there to come back to. I want to live.  I think i want some kinda of spiritual thing.  I'm not entirely sure, but I think i do eventually.  I'm not saying in a christian way or as a way to get into heaven or anything but i dunno, something to believe in other than believing that i don't believe in anything. I want coffee.  No, i need coffee.  It's only 6 months.  Fuck.  Sometimes i feel so alone.  I do wanna do it.  Go to China that is.  And if i wanna teach then i pretty much have to do it as a foot in.   If you liked someone, would it be fair to ask them to wait around for you while you went off and did your thing?   I want to go to the states on my way home from china.    Ok this is getting a little too deep.  Ronin and i were thinking about skateboarding today.  I think maybe the bearings in his trucks are shot bcos it's wobbling way too much when he skates fast.  I can't think of what else it might be other than that.  We're going pinecone picking tomorrow if the weathers good :)  First time this winter. I love the way the smell on the fire.  Oh shit.  My assignments, lol.  I knew there was something i had to do.  Man at this rate i'll never get to China.  You know what sucks.  That there's no victorias secret in NZ. It's just wrong cos there should be.  I know you can buy over the net but it's not the same as going into a store.  That's my rant about underware shops of the day, lol.  I heard this Fiona Apple song called shadowboxer.  I don't think i'm really a fan of her stuff but the song was kinda good.    You made me a shadowboxer, baby   I have a shitload of stuff to do and i really need to stop getting distracted.  Although i like the distractions, lol.   Mangoes would be nice right about now.  And coffee.   songs i like... (they just so happen to be kiwi) misfits of science - fools minuit - menace Datsuns - mutha fuka from hell shihad - pacifier concord dawn ft. scribe - get ready fat freddys drop - hope one million dollars - get off soane ft. freestyle and boh runga - all i need salmonella dub - johnny  black seeds - turn it around verse two - babylon   And the other songs i'm liking right now... Spiderbait - Black betty Beastie boys - Ch-check it out Black eyed peas - weekends remix Metallica - four leaf clover tenacious d - tribute the who - water bob marley - could you be loved  Lmao, do you remember that song 'zoot suit riot'?? I don't know why but it just popped into my head.   I think i need to start to be a hell of a lot more organised and stop procrastinating.   - you’re a menace, to the female sex, you’re a menace, baby  - minuit

      I really really don't understand it.  It just seems like no matter how much i think i have this all figured, i have no idea how it's gonna work out or if it's gonna work out and i'm completely confused.  I think i know what i want but i'm not sure.  And sometimes it seems perfect but argh, who knows.  I wish i had all the answers.  Or some of them even. Having said all that, i wouldn't change things.  Even if it meant things didn't turn out how i want them too.  We'll see.

      I think that sometimes, somethings are better not written here.  Of course i don't think that at them time but on reflection i think, hmm, maybe that's not such a great idea.  But then this is a journal and i'm supoosed to write what i'm thinking right? On to other things.  This lady who wants to take the same course i did has been contacting me to get info.  I emailed and called her yesterday afternoon which was fine.  But then she called me at 8.10 this morning.  8.10!!!!!!  So i drag my ass out of bed, get downstairs to the phone and she says, oh, i guess this is a bad time.  NO SHIT.  Which is what i would've like to have said but i'm far too nice to that so i said no, not at all.  Stupid woman. Cmon. I need coffee.  I should probably go and see Sarah before i leave for china.   I thought about going and seeing Phebes too but i dont' know quite how i'm gonna manage that.  Unless i go to Tarankai and then i could i guess.

      I WAS going to update this on saturday night so i could gloat about us kicking aussies ass in the rugby... only we didn't win. Lol.  We lost 23-18.  It was a great game and even though i love it when we do beat them, i didn't feel so badly about losing this one bcos it was George Greegans 101st game and Matt Burkes last so it was kinda cool that they won.  This is the one and only exception to the never admit i'm quarter aussie rule.  Luckily for me, the being quarter aussie thing comes in handy when we play the wallabies bcos either way i'm on the winning side :p This also works for France, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and it would work for Norway if they were on the Rugby scene but they're not...  It could work for England since my mum is from there, but um yeah, you have to draw the line somewhere, lol. Best moments of the game....  *The Larkin/Spencer fistacuffs. (Bring back the biff) *The ref awarding a penalty to aussie, Greegan running his mouth like always and the penalty being turned over to us.  Does that stop him from yabbering to the ref again?  Of course not, but then this is Greegan we're talking about. *George Greegan taking Mils out, pinning him on the ground and talking shit into his ear and then getting up to walk away and Mils grabbing his leg so he trips over.  *Merthens getting on the field. *The last 10 mins.  When we played such good offense that the fact we didn't score a try didn't really matter.   Having said all that... we need to beat the Springboks in South Africa this week and Aussie needs to lose to them next week for us to win the Tri Nations.  Which is a little bit chancey but possible.   Went to the movies on Friday night with Christian and Carissa.  Saw Hellboy which was alot better than i thought it would be.  Laughed pretty much the whole way through and i have to say, it was alot better done than most of the comic to movies that've come out in recent years, X-Men being the exception.  Spider man sucked, Hulk sucked. I forget what else came out but i do remember them sucking, lol.  Went to burger fuel afterwoods bcos mad dogs and englishmen looked quite dodgy and it was lateish.  Spent way too much time today reading food blogs today but some of them are really interesting.  I was looking at the Les Halles site today and saw that Anthony Bourdain has a cook book out in october. From one of the recipes he has on the site... -When hot--and I mean just short of smoking hot, add the chicken breasts skin-side down. That's SKIN-SIDE down. If you don't hear a sizzle and hiss when you lay in the chicken, your pan is too cold and you've screwed up. If the pan bursts into flames when you add the chicken, your pan is too hot--and you've screwed up.  If flame leaps out of the pan, igniting your hair and splattering burning grease in your face and across the stove--you've screwed up. Call the hospital.- That's some funny shit.   cook books i want right now.   1. Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook : Strategies, Recipes, and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking.  Anyone who writes like that (by the looks of it, just as funny and straight up as cooks tour and kitchen confidential so lots of laughs and language i understand) i can guarantee there book is gonna be well used.   2. The French Laundry cook book.  I've read enough reviews of the place now to know two things.  I have to eat there and i have to have the book.  Also Bouchon. 3. Anything Marco Pierre White bcos White Heat was my first cookbook.  www.cookthebooks.co.nz  Christian copied The Darkness cd for me.  I'm not a fan of glam rock per se but you have to acknowledge any band that has the balls to try it (and pull it off successfully) these days.  Glam hair, glam clothes, glam girly pitch singing and more often than not, cheesey lyrics and catchy tunes.  Some of their songs are not bad.   So in honour...    -i can't get rid of you i don't know what to do i don't even know who is growing on who cos everywhere i go you're there can't get you out of my hair can't pretend that i don't care - it's not fair  i'm punished for all my offences i wanna touch you but i'm afraid of the consequences i wanna banish you from whence you came but you're part of me now and i've only got myself to blame  you're really growing on me or am i growing on you? you're really growing on me or am i growing on you? any fool can see  sleeping in an empty bed can't get you off my head i won't have a life until you're dead yes, you heard what i said  i wanna shake you off but you just won't go and you're all over me but i don't want anyone to know that you're attached to me, that's how you've grown won't you leave me, leave me alone  you're really growing on me or am i growing on you? you're really growing on me or am i growing on you? any fool can see- the darkness

      First things first...  There's been a slight change in plans (isn't there always???)  Last week we were aproached by a couple about catering for their wedding reception. 90 people or there abouts, evening function, cocktail food, at the end of august.  Which of course we couldn't turn down and bcos i'm the creative one, they can't do it without me.  So for the next four weeks i'll be madly planning wedding food and doing lots of trialing and also getting everything set up so i can leave for china as soon after that as possible.  All very exciting, except for the fact that it delays my leaving time by a month so that's another month til i'm in the states.  Which just sucks bcos i want to be there right now. For obvious reasons...  The only thing they're concrete about so far is the cheese board and a croquembouche.  I've been eyeing up cheese the last couple of days and i'm thinking kapiti cheeses accompanied by beesonline honeyed nuts, dried fruits, quince paste and kato chutneys.  Not sure what else yet.   The croquembouche is gonna be kick ass.  Choux pastry balls filled with confectioners custard, piled high into a tower and then with strands of pulled toffee wrapped round it.  I can't do it justice with words so hopefully i'll be able to put a pic up of it at some stage.  Anyway, it's gonna be good.  We're having a meeting with them tomorrow night to give them some more ideas and to finalise the menu.  Bit of a busy week.  Can't remember what i did at the begining of the week.  Except that the starter for the sourdough died a horrible death.  See the thing is, i kinda forgot about it and by the time i did remember it, it was growing copious amounts of mould and stinking the airing cupboard out, lol.  Not pretty.  So i'll have to have a go at that again sometime.  Thursday, did the food for an Art Exhibition at Kings. Sarah came up so hung out with her.  Went out to breakfast with her on Fri morning at Kommik which was nice.  I had french toast and two short blacks.  She wanted pretty much everything on the menu.  Then nothing.  Then half the things. Then back to everything.  Then 3 or 4 things. You get the picture.  Decisions don't come easy for her, lol. She settled for a bagel with cream cheese and salmon and scrambled eggs on toast.  Had to rush into work and help out there for a bit.  Did the food for a party of opera goers.   Went shopping with Sar on friday night.  What a friggen nightmare.  I have words of advice... don't go shopping with a pregnent woman, lol.  I did pick up 2 singles though which was good. Beastie Boys ch-check it out and Black Eyed Peas let's get retarded.  Fell asleep last night listening to the latter.  Went to the Art Exhibition this morning.  There was some good stuff but way out of my price range, which considering the fact that my price range doesn't go beyond free right now... well it's not hard to do.   Then...the best part of the weekend....the food show.  This is a place with four big halls full of anything and everything to do with food.  It's hard to know where to start, there's just so much to see and taste and try and drink.  Normally i'm not the kind of person to go for freebies and in previous years i've held back from trying most things, but this year i decided to let loose.   There were these amazingly good olive oils from Waiheke, quite grassy and fresh.  Chocolate from Bennetts of Mangawhai, which i don't normally like but their feijoa chocolate was pretty good so i bought a bar of their hazlenut chocolate.  This venison steak cooked medium rare from some place i can't even remember the name of, that just melted in your mouth.  Chutneys, dips and hummus like you wouldn't believe.  Cheeses.  Omg the cheese.  I love kapiti cheese and there's a couple of their cheese that i've had my eye on for a while but they're kinda pricey and as yet i haven't gotten round to buying them.  They had them there.  I could probably live without the Mt Hector, but Mt Herbet.  I would've paid the $18 admission just for that.  So good.  I also had Ferndale pyranees which is not a cheesemaker i normally buy from but it was delicious.   And then there was the 7 shortblacks from various coffee companies.  Some were crap, some were ok.  Nothing too spectacular but that along with a red bull and copious amounts of chocolate.... i was buzzing, lol.  There was icecream from movenpick, kapiti, rush minoes and killenchy gold. Liquers, salads, jams, sweets, breads, meat, salami, chicken, bagels, crackers... the list goes on.   Best stands as far as i'm concerned were...  Abe's Real Bagels Bella Verde Limoncello Bennetts of Mangawhai Delmaine Fine Foods Devonport Chocolates Duncan Cervena Elsa's Story Flavours of Spain Food By Chefs Harmony Organic Meat Heuvels Kapiti Cheese and Icecream Kato Pacific Monin Naked Organics Pacific Harvest Phoenix Organics Ponsonby Pies Replete Food Co.  San Pellegrino St Andrews Limes Turkish Kitchen Vanilla Direct Waiheke Olive Group  I got so many good ideas from it and a full stomach, lol.  After 3 1/2 hrs of walking round i was exhausted.   My words of caution to anyone attemping it would be to wear comfortable shoes and don't eat anything beforehand.   Loads more to write but i'm not in the mood so i'll do it later.
