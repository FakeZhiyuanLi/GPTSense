       A panda walked into a diner and ordered a sandwich. After finishing, it  pulled out a gun and fired two shots into the air and started  to leave.  A bewildered and confused waiter asked him what the hell he  just did, and the panda stops and says "I'm a panda. Look it up". He (the  panda) tosses a badly punctuated wildlife guide over his shoulder.  The  waiter finds the relevant entry, and reads: "Panda. Large black and white  animal from China. Eats, shoots and leaves."

       you know what pisses me off? lots of things that i could not mention. but something that really pisses me off is mission football. thats right. everyone says so goddam much smack about us that its not even goddam funny. so if you are one of those people that goes "yeah that persons about as good as our football team", then go join our football team. go make a difference. go be the terrell owens or warren sapp. dont laugh and do nothing about it. if you are gonna laugh, go laugh when you are on the team working your butt off to give our school somewhat of a reputation. laugh at the team when you see everyone working to the brink of insanity to try to win some games. you know what? its not that easy. without enough people its too hard to win games.  ive heard just about all the excuses for NOT joining the team. parents wont let me. scared im gonna get hurt. parents are scared im gonna get hurt. im not gonna play. im too weak. lalala. it goes on forever. well you know what? DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. my parents wouldnt let me play, but because of my persistence in joining, they eventually just caved in. do you know how many people got severely injured last year playing football? 2. if you are too weak go hit the weight room. its free. if you are really out of shape go to both workouts. hey im a twig. im doing football. you wanna know why? because i like the sport and i dont want my school to be a pushover school thats dissed in all areas of athletics. so if you are gonna complain about our football team, first consider how well you would do on it.

       hmm... what's so bad about photobucket? and u prolly could steal Mary's 400 GB HDD and turn it into a server... would be easier than convincing her to connect to the internet again...

       I gave everyone manager priviliges. So you all can go and get more people on here.     Oh and use this as a board to do basically anything. Announcement-type things, random converstations, etc.    Edit: And does anyone know what our reading list is? *geekgeek*

       Just realized: We'll need a good image host to host images for layout. Anyone got webspace we could use? I mean, photobucket is not a happy thing to use.      And anyone else want to join? I'll need your email address.

       Coach Thompson and all three swimming coaches, as well as other coaches on Mission's Sporting staff have been fired due to hazing that happened 7 years ago. Mr. Kew has been put on probation (whatever the hell thats supposed to be, seriously what are they gonna do? make him stay at home while getting the same pay?!). There is a petition going around to get the teachers reinstated. Contact me if you want to sign the petition. I mean seriously, it wasnt the teachers that did the hazing, it was the other athletes that were doing it. WTF is this shit. Well all the football coaches have quit already, so hah. no changed in the football coaching staff. but if you are doing any of the other sports, there is a chance that your coach has been fire. Sign the petition to bring them back!

       this community, like all of the other msjhs communities, is going to waste. i will, therefore, update once.  can someone involved in homecoming keep us posted on this community. cuz the only thing i know about homecoming is that there is a football game that im gonna be playing/losing in. yeah so please keep us posted on how its going. please?  i have posted in this community more often than ihave posted in my own journal. yeah.  have a great rest of the summer. make the best of what you have left, and dont do anything excessively stupid.  and here is a list of stupid things i have done this summer. these are teh ones that stick out. they might not be the most extreme thigns, but whatever. -full moon mission blvd -get kicked off ac transit -almost get kicked out of pga 2 times -kicked out of tap ex -kicked out of taco bell -sign up for 8 hours of classes on tuesdays and thursdays  dont do things like that over your summer. you will regret it. or just dont do the last one.  school starts in 3 weeks. im hella nervous and shit cuz now it fucking counts. wow. okay.
