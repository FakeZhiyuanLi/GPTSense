       Ok well the day before yesterday me and Sam Emerson went on a walk and noticed that my next door neighbors had boys there... Well then we went down to see the horses and they followed us down and all four of us just stood there not talk at all. The boys were boys that me and Donna met two years ago and   there names are Jon and Dillion, creepy right!   Well it turns out that they were pretty hott. We went down the next day and hung with them some more. The cool thing is they might move somewhere around here in the next few years. to bad they are only gonna be here a few more days. Well today we are gonna go see them again and thats all for now.    *Jess and Sam*

        Well Of course First theres  Roxy , she is very bubbly (in a good way). She has been by my side forever and helpin me outa trouble or gettin me into some. Shes the type of friend that wouldnt bail me outta jail because she would be sittin next to me sayin damn that was fun. She always comes up with advise most the time good. Doesnt always say the right thing at the right time...but it makes things interesting. Shes a great friend.    Next theres  Sam E . well sam... shes interesting. Always ready to talk about boys and shopping. Also if i wanta get high of nail polish and see a tree sprout arms i can turn to her. Well there is no way to sum up sam so if u wanta know more about her ask me.    Ok the last friend I gonna talk about today is  Donna . Well me and donna in second grade throu like 6th grade were the best of friends we were praticaly insepriable. In like 7 and 8 grade we kinda drifted apart. We starting to become a little closer right now but no matter how far we drift apart i know donna will be there if something bad happends and i need someone there for me and i glad for that.        i will wright about other friends in other posts
