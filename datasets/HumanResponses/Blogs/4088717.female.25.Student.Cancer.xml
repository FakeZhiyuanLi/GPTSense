      And, for a slight change in pace, here's something to make you chuckle, rather than ponder.   urlLink The Jean-Paul Sartre Cookbook   My favourite bit:  "Spoke with Camus today about my cookbook. Though he has never actually eaten, he gave me much encouragement."  I nearly spat my beer at my monitor when I first read it.

      It should come as no surprise to any of my friends that I am not sexually conservative.  I define sexual conservativism as follows (quoted from "Basic Types of Sexual Philosophy" by Dr. Kurt Preinsperg):   "Sexual conservatives believe that sex purely for pleasure's sake is unfulfilling or immoral (or usually both). Sex is morally right and deeply fulfilling only if it is associated with love, procreation and marriage. Sexual conservatives differ in their willingness to relax these three requirements. Traditional sexual conservatives regard all sex outside marriage as morally wrong and degrading; but modern sexual conservatives usually regard sex as wrong and degrading only if there is not at least a loving commitment between two partners."   In my view, this attitude, while morally permissable, is certainly not morally required. I believe that placing such strict limitations on sex can limit a person's opportunities for fulfillment and relationship enhancement, rather than increase these things as a more conservative person would suggst.  There are many benefits to having sex with more than one person in your lifetime and having sex outside of marriage, including:    Because each of us are indivduals with our own tastes and preferences, it makes sense to discover a person's sexual preferences before commiting to a life-long relationship.  Marrying someone who you are sexually incompatible with may be a recipe for an unfulfilling marriage.  Having a wide variety of experiences is generally considered to be favourable when it comes to nearly everything else in life. For example, if a person is learning to cook, it is recommended that they learn different styles of cooking from different instructors.  Yes, I realize that arguing by analogy is dirty pool, but it really seems rational in this case.  More important than the sex itself is the respect between the two or more persons involved.  Promise keeping, consent, and honesty are morally required in all relationships, which includes ones that are sexual in nature.  As long as these requirements are met, and no one is being harmed in any other respect, what does it matter that a relationship is not one that involves a life-long commitment?   Conservatives would argue against the second and third points by stressing that sex is too special to be shared with multiple people. I find it interesting that sex is viewed as something finite or sacred, as it is simply another aspect of our social lives.  Sex is finite only in the time we have to spend doing it, and our physical ability, which in most people is recovered easily with a bit of rest.  To be continued.  Feel free to comment, but please remember that I'm far from done talking about this topic.

      To begin, I'll start with one of my favourite topics, the philosophy of love, sex and friendship. For the purposes of this post, I'm going to define this topic as encompassing these questions:   Conceptual Questions  1. How can love, sex or friendship be defined? 2. What forms of each can be distinguished? 3. How are they related to each other?   Empirical Questions  4. What are the phenomenological manefestations of love, sex or friendship? 5. How has people's understanding of these phenomena fluctuated throughout history? 6. How does biological sex and socially conditioned gender affect our experience of sex, love and friendship?   Ethical Issues  7. What are our moral obligations in intimate relationships? 8. How can we responsibly balance freedom and intimacy? 9. What kinds of relationships are most healthy and fulfilling? 10. What social changes are desirable if love and friendship are to flourish? 11. Are we morally required to combine sex with love or is sex without love also acceptable? 12. What is the best attitude to take towards marriage? 13. Under what conditions, if at all, is adultery permissable? 14. How should we approach romantic beginnings? 15. What does true equality between lovers require?  These questions come from a handout I received in Philosophy 2210: Contemporary Moral Issues, at Langara College, taught by Dr. Kurt Preinsperg.  He's a fabulous instructor, and I'm really quite upset that the semester is just ending.  How can I possibly cover these issues in the space of two days?  I can't, which is why I'm starting this here.  I'll be posting answers to these questions slowly over the next little while.  In the meantime, however, feel free to make some of your own observations, or ask your own questions.  I would also appreciate any links to good philosophy blogs, or any information about books that are applicable to this or any other of my future topics.  Thanks for reading! :)
