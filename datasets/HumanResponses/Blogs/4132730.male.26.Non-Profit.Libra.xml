      I come to realise something. It takes every lesson you've learned and turns it on its head. "Respect the lives of others." "Treat people as you yourself would like to be treated." Sometimes we close our eyes and just listen to the echoes of our hearts. We all fall in love and there are times when we love so much that we lose ourselves in our emotions. More often than not, we wonder why there are love that grows, and love that grows cold. We would start to search for answers and try to find where love has gone wrong. But in the end, we find ourselves where we started for we cannot question love when it has its own reasons. Love will always be as it always has been....silent, mysterious and deeply profound. Many of us believe that love is forever, that love never dies, only to be disillusioned in the end when we find our hands empty and our hearts longing. We mistakenly have looked at love as a need to be fulfilled. But love is a gift given to us. We should not hold it in our hands for we may never find the strength to let it go when it decides to leave. We should only embrace its warmth and glow while it last and then freely open our arms when its time to say good-bye. When we fall in love, we don't want that feeling to end for it is everything we are, everything we wanted to be. We pray that love will stay and grow in our hearts. But if it doesn't then we should never let our lives be taken by it, for life should not end where heartaches begin. There is always a reason why we have to move on. When we have to say good-bye to the feeling we wanted to stay forever, let us not wave our hands with a heavy heart. For love will have to set its wings free and find the place where it belongs. We may have lost it but then again, when we close our eyes and listen, we will hear that feeling resounding silently forever. Then we'll know that love never left us, for the good that we have become because of love will always stay. Love will always be there, reminding us that we should be thankful and happy not because we have lost love, but because, for once in our lives, that feeling called love lived in our hearts and made us happy.

      We'd probably all agree that going through life blindfolded would be like taking a trip without a road map. Though that journey may be an adventure to remember, it left me lost, confused and disappointed at that time. So much so that school work start to deterioated. My folks at home, they were the comfort and joy in my life. They were precise and positive in almost every way Therefore their affection, kindness, and interest were not shown in a way to spoil me at that time or either in years to come. Their attention to me was for my support and comfort. While their precise rules with me, and their ways before me, were for my good and benefit then and thereafter.  3 years down the road, I finally graduated. Indeed how very true, time did proved everything. I began to accept the fact and trying to get everything behind me. That was also the time where i met her (Think i'll just let her remain anonymous). She was a very beautiful lass with silky layered dark brown hair, hypnotizing hazel watery eyes and long lashes. Met her thru a common friend. The rest of the nobility now think of him as a matchmaker in his own unique ways haha. She and I confirmed the ‘opposites attract’ cliché. She was stunningly intriguing, the kind of girl who would outshone the life of any parties. Sadly we didn't lasted very far. I kept wondering how stupid does one have to be before they realize they were actually trying to move mountains, trying to do what they can't really do. So, I looked at myself, saw the scratches in my thoughts, and I realize that the answer is obviously pretty stupid. Sometimes I find it surprising that I have not seriously contemplated or attempted suicide. haha! Why? Because I spend a great deal of time consumed in self-inflicted doom and gloom. I scrutinized my life, magnify its flaws, and slip into holes of unhappiness. My dissatisfaction gradually added up until I felt like there was a pressure cooker within me. I was strong enough; I would piece myself back together again. And perhaps that was true, my periods of depression were like intermittent rain, they came and go. I was well-aware of my dysfunctional personality and my lack of self-resolve and self-control at that time. There were indeed better ways of handling problematic situations like these, which i admit i sucked at it, and thus the ending. It was an evil ending, but i'm glad it ended anyway.

      Corrine had a loving and secure childhood. She was provided with the bestest of everything. Dad was a successful businessman and mum was a devoted housewife. Yes, she's the only child, so her temperament was considerably more confident than her parent's ever was. It was proof of the loving atmosphere that Corrine had cultivated in her early teenage years.  Time flies, We are into our 8th year together. Corrine's graduation from college had just taken place. Both parents had proudly attended the ceremony at Temasek JC, each taking enough photographs and video footage of her graduation to embarrass even the most devoted child. Now that she had completed college, her parents expected her to go to Australia to further her studies. She had long planned to continue her education, but when it actually came time, She was unsure. But doting dad eventually had it his way. Corrine was to be gone in Australia for the next 4 years or so.  We had promised to write to each other and call each other constantly, a time where emails ain't very popular. But, like what everyone expected, after a few weeks, the phone calls became less frequent and the letters in the mail stopped coming. Corrine had been there for almost 2 years. It was time where exams and tests are at their critical stage for me. The class work was harder than anything I ever had before. So I hunkered down and mapped a strategy to make it through the rigorous school, by keeping to myself and focusing on bunker mentality, like what all my other classmates like to put it.  Half-way thru the rigous path of school examinations, the devastating news came. It was April 15th 2000. Corrine was involved in a car accident round Sunshine Coast, Brisbane Australia. It happened before dawn on the day that Corrine was to have put herself on a flight to Tasmania where his father would have been waiting. The details from that point were sketchy as she was travelling in her brand new Ford Fiesta LX alone. The roads there were narrow, hilly dirt roads that to this day are intimidating to even the most seasoned city drivers. A blizzard hit. According to local police, the corner of the car caught Corrine, slamming her into the windshield and throwing her onto the pavement. Of all the things to happen to me in my life, none would be quite as significant as this one. Everyone was devastated. Nothing prepared me for the intense loss, anguish, and fear, let alone the parents, who have raised this only child expecting and giving only the very best to her.  Grieving is as much a part of me at that time as a foot or an eye. Many people told me of the stages of grief I would go through. There were days when I felt sadness, missing her presence, her hugs, laughter, and smiles. At that time, if you heard my laughter, it's not because I've forgotten or stopped mourning. It's because with the help of friends I am slowly beginning to see through the storm to daylight again. It is said that something like this shows you who your true friends are. Many of these people are common friends of ours, and I thank them deeply. Her parents fought hard, never losing hope of winning the battle. But I lost a soulmate, a friend, a sincere partner on April 15th, 2000. The battle wasn't lost, however, the victory will be hers in the end.

      The memories of my happy, care-free teenage days were often with me. It was 1990, where war between US and Iraq was raging. That great event in history was a matter wholly outside the realm of our childish interests. Of course we heard our elders discuss the various events of the great struggle, but it meant nothing to us, not to Corrine and me to say, as we were both totally immersed in our very own worlds.  We met in the most normal of all circumstances, denying prevalent opinion of relationships via being classmates initially. It seem to me that the whole view of the world had just changed rather abruptly. The class had a wicked sense of humor at times. Things weren't going very smoothly at first. It's a very funny thing. Avoiding personal blame and responsibility is to blame the relationship itself. We let each other down at times in the early stages. That was when both of us were not clear on what's the perspective towards this relationship were to us. She had a "boyfriend" outside a boyfriend, and i had a "girlfriend" outside a girlfriend. Ya rite, blame it on some unchangeable characteristic of each individual. Bullshit, crap! It's all self belief. This kind of excuses are either a cop-out or a dead end to all relationships. One partner can make the other miserable, but can't make the other unfaithful. Gradually both of us recovered from this "setback" and learn to cherish each other better. Who knows, amist all the hype and criticisim, we still managed to hold out the relationship for a good 8 years. People often say that true love should include faded love or love that has died. I say this is not exactly true. We survived all hardships, time, distance, even death itself.

      My surrendered life sounds a clarion call to this generation, to a commitment that will make my spiritual destiny glorious. Sounds bad? Not exactly. The year was 1989.. Our friendship has ripened with the years as together we have shared the hopes and disappointments. I have wrote with deep interest this story of my life and is a pleasure for me to write this word of appreciation for a soulmate, a friend, a saviour, a lifetime partner who has shown such unselfish devotion, Corrine Lim.  Some time back, I was asked by a friend to write an account of the background and of the facts of my life. The request never appealed to me from any angle so it just passed by without comment. These requests have somehow, through the years, lingered. "Take the case," said he, "of Corrine. Why don't you write out the story of your own life, how you got over it, started afresh, telling frankly about her as you have learned it."  She was a beautiful girl. Long straight tresses with shades of chestnut brown. A frank, open hearted woman with tender sympathies and an unusual readiness to help any and everybody. Her position back then gave her a large opportunity to supply the bodily wants not only of her associates but also of that class 1E6, Mayflower Sec, 1989. So proficient was she in many ways that she caught my attention soon after. We started those small conversations at the very end of the class for almost every other subjects, so your guess is as good as mine. She not only grabbed my attention, but also that of the teachers. The school was noted for its order and discipline at that time. The headmaster, a progressive, matter of fact man, seemed to have no racial prejudice and did not hesitate to hold up this school as the model for the country, irrespective of race. As a result, we were often spotted standing outside the class. Wave of interest was evident. There were many conversions and great excitement for miles around. Corrine doesn't seem to mind. So weeks passed by, and affections grow.  It was April 1989. I couldn't really remember the exact date. Those days were fraught with varied experiences. I was enthusiastic and determined to be and do my best I entered an important stage of which I had much to learn, how to be a good boyfriend and what relationship was all about. Gradually, I found my heart turning more and more towards the challenge. We began going out, initially in a group, then groups of 4, and finally became a daily routine that we meet up after school to catch a movie or just chill out. Then came a time where I was struck by the real need frankly expressed, and carefully answered, saying, that though my time was fully being to juggle between school, work and her, i wanted her to become my soulmate, my girlfriend. Thinking more seriously and realizing that I might 1 day regretted all these if I don't make her mine, I took action. I was surprised to find myself holding her hands. At that time i was thinking, "We would have to rely more on each other, after all we are getting more sensible now and its good for us to seek comfort and companionship with each other". I remember what our friends used to say about us. I don't know if it could be done, but i tried anyway. Most of the time, we choose the easy way out. Just keep quiet about it. I will tell her when the time is ripe. So when will time be ever ripe? Tomorrow? What if it does not come? Wun everything be too late then? But i'm glad i did tell her eventually, because if i didn't at that time, I would never ever have the chance again....
