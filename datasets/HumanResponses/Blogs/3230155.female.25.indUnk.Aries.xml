        The past few days in pictures...   The most important thing that happened is that I now know how to post pictures in my blog! Yahoo! Super thanks to  urlLink Bianca   for bearing with the techo klutz that I am :)  I also went out with my HS barkada and finally met Annika Reese Garcia-Mendoza. She was such a sweet and cheerful baby, specially when you consider that we just barged in their house at 1am and woke her up (and mommy and daddy too!). However, instead of getting all haughty and uppity (as babies are prone to do... :) she graciously blessed us with countless toothless but severely charming smiles.   Tita Rosella was obviously smitten and couldn't keep her paws away from the baby girl. Quote for the night: Ella says "Ang bango! Ang lambot! Kaya pala ganito mag-kiss ng babies ang mga lola no?" (and then proceeds to kiss and sniff at the baby all over again)"   Ayeese + Ryan = Annika Reese (definitely a great cocktail of genes)     The Santos sisters came over for a visit (but thankfully they weren't at the house at the same time, or things would have been veeeery exciting...) and it's adequately proven that mugging for the camera is definitely a genetic thing.            On the television front, I'm now addicted to Wazzup, Wazzup (I crush you Archie Alemania! *blush*) and  urlLink American Idol .   But my favorite John Stevens has been voted out! Booooo!!!     My vote now goes to George Huff. You're my dawg Mr. Huff!  That's about it. I hope to hear from people very soon, or else this blog will go to seed... (did anyone feel threatened with that? I didn't think so. :)

        Dear Fellow Pinoys,  I hope you were all paying attention while watching "The Day After Tomorrow", for that movie laid bare the most feasible way for a third world country, such as the Philippines, to become a Superpower.  It is more than apparent that we can never compete with the Superpower Countries in terms of economy, so if we cannot beat them at their own game, let's just wipe them off the face of the planet (or at least the Northern part of the US and some European countries).  By changing the flow of the Atlantic chuvachu, the delicate line between the saline and fresh water churvaness will be disrupted and so the earth will experience a major climate change. Think tornadoes, rapidly dropping temperature, halestorms etc. However, only the Northern part of the earth will experience such catasrophe (Read: the developed countries), the southern part will continue sipping pinacoladas and island hopping in their 1701 (high tide) islands.  So the solution for world supremacy is obvious, let us just continue burning fossil fuels by the truck load and Superpowerdom will finally be within our grasps. It may seem harsh and extreme, but we have to do it for it is the only way that we can make the bagoong at par with Beluga caviar and replace Ronald McDonald with our beloved Jollibee.  Kaya natin, basta't tayo'y magsasama-sama.

        Reminiscing   While browsing through the photos folder last night, I chanced upon various Zobel pix(graduation, plays, christmas parties etc.) it was then I realized just how much my little school has grown.   When I first entered as a first grader, the canteen was at the basement of the main building (it had styrofoam celings so kids were always standing on the tables furtively etching their names or their crushes name, before some authority figure caught them). The library was at the 2nd or 3rd floor and it wasn't airconditioned yet. Now, the canteen is in a separate building altogether (which made recess quite inconvenient during the rainy season because of the longer trek via the covered walk rather than the more convenient walk via the uncovered walk). The library is now at the basement and being airconditioned, became the tambayan of some students who valiantly tried to smother their giggles or keep their chattering to a hush.    About a year after I graduated, the theater was formally inaugurated. It has an artsy fartsy sculpture in front probably to further bolster its claim as "The CCP of the South". Somehow I think my life would have been better if the theater had been in place when I was still in Zobel. If we were to go by stereotypes, I would have been a theater geek, so it would have been my place of solace where I could fine tune my art. I could have been an artist, rather than the artisan in training that I am today! Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Of course, what would our school life be without our teachers? During my sister's graduation, I was all giddy looking around for my past teachers for a photo-op. I don't know why, but at that time, I felt like I was having a photo-op with an artista. Yes, I was that kilig to have my pic taken with them.     Ms. Delfin (or Mommy Dee or Judge Dredd, depending on her mood) has to be one of my most favorite teachers of all time. She exemplified the ideal teacher, for she was nurturing, loving and I'd always go to her whenever I needed a hug. However, her outbursts were also legendary. The first time I heard her shout "Hunghang! Linoloko mo pa ako!" in class, I was flabbergasted. After the nth time that happened, I would just try to prevent my lips from smiling while watching my unfortunate classmate try to worm his way out of her disapproving gaze and machine-gun like tirade. Of course, I was also at the receiving end of her "Halika nga dito at kukurutin ko ang singit mo!" a couple of times. Oh the good old days :) Right now, she no longer teaches, instead, she holds an administrative position because a past operation makes it difficult for her to climb stairs (and the HS is at the third floor, so you can just imagine the stair-climbing involved there).    My most memorable, unforgettable teacher would have to be Mr. Elloso. I had a run-in with him that would forever be etched in my mind. So anyway, it was one of those regular classes where we were waiting for the next teacher to arrive, I don't remember why it took so long for her to arrive but some of my classmates must have been feeling playful so two of them (Martin and DA), started kicking a box if front of the class. Some other boys joined in the fun, while the girls were chattering and laughing like banshees when suddenly in walks Mr.Elloso. He was fuming mad. He berated us for our behaviour, saying something like "Sigurado ba kayong pilot section kayo?! Pwe!!" then he walked out, even madder (if that was possible) than when he entered.  Everyone tried to be quiet while waiting for our next class, but I was facing the window and so I saw that he was at the other side of the building glaring at our class. I told Maggie (who had her back to the window) and she's like:   M: Anong ginagawa niya ngayon?  J: Nakatingin pa rin, galit na galit siya grabe.   We were trying to contain our laughter all this time, but horribly failing when suddenly...   J: Oh shit! Pabalik yata siya dito!   Everyone tried to look innocent and angelic when he stomped his way back to our class   Mr. Elloso: Ms. Sabitsana! Anong nakakatawa?!  J: S-s-sir?  E: Ano sabi ang pinagtatawanan niyo?!?!  J: S-sir wala ho...  E: Walang nakakatawa pero tawa ka nang tawa? Alam mo ba kung saan linalagay yung mga taong tumatawa pero wala namang nakakatawa?  J: Sir, sa mental?   Elloso exits in a huff and class breaks into laughter  Of course, it was obviously intended to be a rhetorical question and so I should have just kept my trap shut. But as you can see, from the pic, we're friends now. Actually, immediately after the incident, he waited for me outside the classroom and lectured me on politeness, decorum etc. I apologized like there was tomorrow and the good thing about Mr. Elloso is that he really doesn't keep grudges, so upon seeing that my apology was genuine and that I didn't mean to insult him with my brainless (pun intended) comment, he forgave me right there and then.    I also had the chance to play teacher when I volunteered (but with remuneration) to teach at Zobel's Adult Night High School. I taught English (Grammar and Reading Comprehension) to the 2nd year and 5th year (preparatory for college) students and it was definitely one of the most fulfilling experience of my life. I was so happy to see some of my students during the graduation rites (apparently, the ANHS own ceremony was right after the day HS). I don't know what has happened to my fifth year students, I'm hoping that at least some of them are in college now. My 2nd year students are in their 5th year now (how time flies!) and I promised to attend their graduation next June like I attended (and even emceed) my 5th year students' graduation.  So while some people think of spoiled brats and more spoiled brats when Zobel is mentioned, I'll always think of it as home.

        The Passion     I was so excited to learn that the rights to my favorite  urlLink book  had been bought by Miramax and that Gwyneth Paltrow and Juliet Binoche had already been signed.   I wonder who'll be playing Villanelle? I can't quite imagine the ice-cold Paltrow as the boatman's daughter. Juliette Binoche seems more credible as Villanelle since she has this earthy aura around her that the sophisticated Paltrow sadly lacks. But Gwyneth has a boyish figure and so that will also factor in with Villanelle's penchant for cross-dressing. Hmmmm....  Another thing I'm antsy over is the casting for Henri, the peasant-boy turned soldier. Henri was described as a simple and steadfast person. The perfect foil to Villanelle's fiery ways. Of course, Villanelle had red hair (red=fiery/passion) while Henri's hair color wasn't dwelt on, so taking off from his description in the book I'm assuming that it would probably be some mousy color. Please let it be Jude Law!  I really took to this book because it came at a critical point in my life and through it, I began to understand myself more. I finally saw that I was an Henri and not a Villanelle. That I was French countryside and not mystical Venice.   Just like Henri, I knew that something was missing with my life and so off we both went in search of our passions. But unlike Henri, I didn't sign up for the army, however we still found the passionate person to whom we were instinctively drawn to.   We tried to keep up with our passionate loves however, our steadfast ways were not enough for them. Fire cannot be contained, it must die out on its own.  And so he's in his Rock Castle and I'm in my fortress, both of us singed and wary of the same thing happening again. But here comes the all importance difference, while Henri has permanently cloistered himself in his castle, I am merely gathering my strength within the walls of my fortress. I have already taken a few tentative steps outside my walls and everything seems to be in order once more. The dating life goes on:).  Trivia: It was because of this film that Mel Gibson's  Passion of the Christ  was named as such. Gibson originally wanted to name his opus  The Passion  but Miramax already beat him to the title. So there.

        Feeling Sosy   I just spent the last two days at a hotel in the Ortigas business district playing the role of the token adult to my sister and cousin.  Staying in a hotel room for two days made me realize a few things:  1. The view from the 23rd floor is amazing! That's probably why those gods and goddesses at Olympus loved playing around with the humans, it's so much fun to see them scattering about like ants.  2. Playing voyeur on the people in the next high-rise is only fun for the first 15 minutes. I sadly didn't see anyone getting whacked or anyone getting lucky.  3. These bones are Pinoy through and through. That room was sooo cold and to think the thermostat was already set at 25.   4. Piped in music in the bathroom and a hot shower are must haves in the future.  5. A breakfast buffet is man's greatest invention and a "Last Call for Buffet" sign can cause a panic attack as well as a stampede (gotta have more bacon!!!).

         Peekchur, Peekchur...   Yesterday was my parents' 26th wedding anniversary so the whole family (minus Santi, Char and Mick) heard the 6:30pm mass and then trooped over to, where else, Chicken Bacolod.  Seguey time. A typical restaurant searching conversation in our family goes like this:   Tatay: San nyo gusto kumain?  Jill: North Park!  Tatay: Mamamatay ka ng maaga sa vetsin don.  Melo: Shakey's!  Tatay: Kayo lang naman natutuwa don e.  Krissy: Conti's?  Tatay: E kaka-paorder lang natin don.  Everyone: ...ummm...Chicken Bacolod?  Tatay: Don, buti pa don na lang. (and proceeds to park the vehicle in front of Chicken Bacolod)   So there we were again at Chicken Bacolod. I ordered isol (again) and Drago told me (again) that "You are what you eat". To which I responded: "Nya-nya-nya" (again).             check out Melo's finger   HAPPY ANNIVERSARY MAMA AND TATAY!

        Dear Pogi Potential Boss (PPB),  You don't have to play games with me. I can see right through you. I can see that you're totally into me too *blush*.   I only sent my application through  urlLink Jobstreet.com  yesterday afternoon, and yet when evening came, we were already burning the phone lines! I feel so connected with you, you were such a great listener. You patiently listened on while I talked about my past job experiences (none); how law school is going (so-so); whether or not I would consider working for the company (with you!) and so on and so forth. You know all these things about me and yet I know nothing about you! Do forgive me for my self-absorbed ways.  We then planned to meet today (supposedly for an "interview", but I know better *wink*)and again you surprised me with your thoughtfulness when you moved the "interview" to the coffee shop across the street. It was allegedly because no one was still at the office, but I know better. You let everyone else come to work late just so that we could meet for lunch! You are just so dang sweet!  I was kinda hesitant with the change in venue, for how would I know it was you? I'm sure our souls would have immediately known each other, but sometimes my feeble mind just cannot grasp such esoteric intertwinings. And then you said the most magical words: I'll be wearing a blue shirt. How did you know that, next to pink and red, blue is my favorite color?! You are just too much. Dressing up in my third favorite color just to please me.  And so destiny was set to happen. I was writing down my thoughts on such a momentous occasion when you said my name and I looked up to see you resplendent in blue. Never had I ever seen such hue look as good as it did on you (uy it rhymes! You've made me into a poet...). You offered to buy me lunch but I politely demurred while ever so primly sipping my iced chocolate. Again, we talked about me. But I felt your discomfort as you could not look straight at me and instead focused your attention on the resume in front of you (you were probably transfixed with the 2x2 photo delicately posted on the upper right side of the sheet of paper). You dropped magical words like "offshore" and "consultancy" and I felt like a humble student listening with awe while a benevolent sage imparted his wisdom.  I knew then that I had to take matters into my own hands and if I were to know anything about you, I would have to seize the opening because being such a humble person, you would not volunteer information about yourself. So when you asked: Do you have any questions? I immediately asked about this great company you have loyally affiliated your kind self with. I listened in rapture while you told me about the company's beginnings in some far-away land called America. I imagined just how envious Camelot would be seeing that it is but a mere hamlet when pitted against your glorious kingdom.  Alas, all good things must come to an end. I vainly tried to prolong our "interview" and yet I knew that I must not be selfish and keep you to myself when others were also desperate to bask in your presence. We said our goodbyes with the promise to get in touch either this week or the next. I can only carry on the pretense of living until that fateful day, so do not let me suffer for so long.  Until our paths cross once again, I remain your potential Girl Friday (or GF, as I like to term it.)

         Dear Dindo,  You are such a killjoy.  You knew that I had been raring to go to Bohol and to visit my tarsier friends, but were you sensitive to my needs?! NO!  Your callous self just had to visit our islands and thus cancel the inter-island ferry trips.  I hope you take a moment (nay, take two moments) and realize just how inappropriate and how selfishly you've acted. And maybe then, we'll be on speaking terms once again.  Think about it.

         Jill's List of Necessary Evils   1. Handbags/ Shoulder bags- personally I can't stand the thing. As much as possible, I try to carry just enough stuff (keys, money, phone) that will fit in my pocket.   2. Lotion- it's sticky and hot, however, it's a must use unless you fancy your skin resembling asphalt.  3. Glasses- it's uncomfortable and it gets in the way of...umm...other more important things in life.  4. Contact Lenses- they quickly dry out and become dreadfully annoying halfway into the night. (what I wouldn't give for Lasik eye surgery!)  5. Stilettos(sp?)- they cause foot pains, back aches and they could be used as a weapon (Hey! That's not an evil! :), but they do make one's legs look long, slender and vavavoom!  6. Mel Tiangco- I hate her voice but her work with children is highly commendable.  7. Waxing- enough said.  8. Headlines- it's usually just bad news in bold print but it's necessary to keep oneself informed.  9. Thongs- the things women suffer through for vanity and a smooth VPL-less backside.  10. Democracy (at least for now)

        Whattaday!   Today was a very emotional day for me.  I finally had my long overdue talk with my dad (no thanks in part to my sister's meddling!) and at the first sign that this was going to be "the talk", i felt my eyes watering up. He reminded me of how lucky I was to be where I was, how literally thousands would beg, steal and kill to be in my shoes.  Although I knew this was coming and I thought I was prepared, all I could say was "Ayoko na talaga" over and over again before succumbing to tears.  I realized then that the answer: I was not happy anymore/ I was miserable where I was, just did not cut it with my family. Personal feelings took a back seat to one's obligations and duties to the family. Did I ever mention that my family sees itself as the Corleone family in The Godfather? My tito Sandy is Michael while my tatay is Santino, which is funny because they both named their sons Michael and Santino respectively. But I digress.  But my tatay took a PLDT "Kung saan ka masaya, suportahan taka" kind of stance and didn't raise the issue anymore. It was a pretty emotional moment, to tell you frankly, and I didn't have PMS to pin the blame on, like I usually do. Maybe it's about time to come out in the open and come clean. Hello, my name is Jill and I'm a closet crybaby. (Hello Jill!)  I took a drive to my dorm and cleaned out my mess. I said goodbye to my roommate Karen, but not too loudly because the new roomie was still asleep. It was pretty amazing that 1.5 years of stay could be packed in one large bag, a big wire basket and a laundry bag filled with shoes. I guess that's why I've never been too attached to material objects, because if I were to gauge my life on my material possessions, I would probably have a bag of junk and used clothing. So what does that say about my life?! Again, I digress.  So now I'm at another crossroad. However this time, no one's prodding me on which fork to take. And that's the way I like it.

        Tsismis   Who's this southern chick who recently went to an even more southern town with a potential significant other?  Said southern chick and potential S.O. have been burning the phone lines and making much use of their cellular phones, contributing significantly to the rise of the industry (much to the delight of a certain Mr. JPC).  This blog can only speculate on what really happened in that southern town, which affords a nice panoramic view of a half-submerged volcano. Because even with persistent badgering, the hot southern chick still would not divulge the juicy details.  Clues?  The southern chick is undoubtedly one of the more kikay denizens of a certain law school in Quezon city while her current paramour's name sounds almost like our beloved secretariat head's name.  Guess away :)

        Thank you   It has oft been said that the only thing that's keeping the literary effort alive in this country is the Carlos Palanca Awards. The Philippines is just not a "reading" country. However, it warms the cockles of my heart to see that another bigwig family (the Gokongweis) has also taken on the challenge of infusing the love of reading into the populace. And so a new genre in Philippine literature is born,  urlLink chick lit .               I read an article of the Summit novel launch a few weeks ago and I found the picture of Prof. Christina Pantoja-Hidalgo (Mam Jing) with Myrza Sison hilarious. It was like Cosmo Girl meets the Prudish Prof. One is nonchalant when it comes to issues on sexuality while the other thinks it already daring to wear open toed sandals. One writes good catholic girl type of short stories while the other writes about the modern kamasutra.  Yin and yang. Day and night. But with a common love and endeavor, that being to get most of the Pinoys and Pinays to just read (dammit!). And that is already a laudable effort IMHO.

        Travel Time   The travel bug has definitely taken a huge bite out from this family.  The virus first hit Drago and Margot and accompanied them all the way to Calatagan and Boracay.       Right now, Sir Ed has put on his travel cap once again and hied off to Dumaguete. He plans to visit Apo Reef daw.  I've only been to Galera since summer started, but next week brings about a wonderful change in venue as I go to Cebu (makikipista ho!) and then on to Bohol. Where I can finally accomplish one of my dreams in life, that being a photo-op with a tarsier. Damn the Chocolate Hills and Loboc River, I just want to get near those bug-eyed mammals.  Santi, Char and Mick also went to Bohol for the Holy Week, and to Galera before that. Mick had tons of pix taken with a tarsier! Thus fueling my desire to have one of my own too. Oh yes, you will be mine...  As with Krissy, she's been a virtual boarder at home (only stopping by to deposit dirty laundry and to get clean clothes) ever since Chiki arrived from Cebu. They've been staying at hotels, touring the metro, watching PBA games and doing the grand mall tours. Today they plan on watching MTB (definitely my sister's idea) and I'm just positive that she'll be wearing some bright color and texting the moment a camera swings by their way. My sister, the ham.  Melo hasn't been anywhere since summer started! Tsk-tsk-tsk nag summer classes kasi si Milo e. However, the gremlin has been boxing at Wildcard (where he gets to hang out with the likes of Manny Pacquiao) so I think he's pretty content staying at home, near his beloved gym.  Francis and Candice also visited us from Cebu last March. They too played tourists and visited Baclaran, Quiapo, Greenhills, Megamall, Enchanted Kingdom, Splash Island and Batangas.        Tita Violeta is again visiting from the States just to attend the fiesta at Moalboal. She just has to be my most favorite tita. My ears always perk up whenever I hear her name mentioned because she's such a character.   Every time she's here, she goes all around "para magpabeauty", as she terms it. She has her hair permed; her warts cauterized; shops for a new wardrobe and goes ballroom dancing all night long. However, her last visit was different because she had liposuction done on her abdomen and arms and had her eyefold fixed. I was away at the dorm when she went under the knife and was so excited to come home and see what the results were. Unfortunately, she wore a robe the entire time so I was unable to see her overhauled figure. As with her eyes, maybe it's just me, but I really didn't see any difference! That's plastic surgery for you.  I'm sniffling and sneezing while typing this because a different type of bug has also caught up with me. But the thought of having unlimited internet access once more and packing my backpack once again has already more than cured me. Hallelujah!

        Giddy   Yahoo! Our DSL is back! No more flickering lights! No more hit and miss when it comes to browsing!  And all it took was a week of persistent phone calls and two visit from the PLDT team. Apparently, there was something wrong with the underground connection or something to that effect. Mr. PLDT Repair Guy asked the Night Team (as opposed to the Day Team I guess) to work on the wiring chuva-chu. Et voila! DSL connection is restored once more.  So I am surfing and browsing to my heart's desire again and I can hardly contain the joy sweeping through my body :)   I swear, I can actually feel the power of the net surging from my ecstatic fingertips! hehehehe (a certified net geek, I confess :)

        Crunch Time   I received some bad news yesterday. But it was also the sort of news that made me reevaluate (for the nth time!) my current position in life. The same old questions resurfaced:   What am I doing?  Why am I doing this?  For whom am I doing this?   Let me tell you now that I didn't like my answers to any of those questions.  I've always been obedient (hello Ella Enchanted?) to my family but up to what extent? I guess it took me quite a while to realize that my family's plans for me do not automatically equate into my own. I alone am responsible for my own happiness in life. It would be a sad and sick world if people could blame others for their misery. Oh, people already DO blame others for their misery :) so does that mean that it's a sad and sick world?

        Grrrr...   ...Our PLDT DSL connection is still erratic! For the past few days, I've only been able to log from 6-8am. AND I was informed by a friend, whose family owns an internet cafe, that they experienced the same problem a few months ago and it took about a month for their DSL to function 24/7. I sure hope I'm getting that promised rebate.  ...Friendster is down.   It's gonna be a loooong day.

        My Line up    President:  Roco (there's no such thing as a wasted vote people! Wake up people!)   Vice-President:  Legarda (Loren over Noli? Anyday, sweetheart.)   Senators:    1. Yasay (he should have made it in the last elections pa) 2. Lim (whom Ping should emulate IMHO) 3. Pimentel (such a gentleman, this one) 4. Anson-Roa (the anti-thesis to all the artistas running for office) 5. Mauricio (free legal aid from Atty. Batas) 6. Madrigal (she should get voted, if only for her tenacity in running for a seat. Oh yeah, Juday endorses her too, so she can't be all that bad :) 7. Cayetano (UP Law! Love your own, ika nga.) 8. Roxas (effective and gwapo. Need I still elaborate on why he has my vote?:) 9. Sonza (a probable Noli? I hope not...) 10. Chavez (the most dashing sol-gen this country has ever had. Sigh.)  That's about it. I'd rather vote for 10 people that I believe in than completing all 12 slots just for the heck of it. Although it might appear that I might have based some of my votes on qualifications other than the ability to serve (guilty!), I beg to differ. I believe that some beautiful and charismatic people do have the strength of character to hold public office. The voters just have to learn how to pick one bonbon from another.  Besides, how can you go wrong with Roxas and Chavez in office?   For Paranaque mayor, I'm going for Olivarez. Alma is just as corrupt as her husband was. Six years of the Moreno-Marquez tandem has made Paranaque into one stinking garbage pile. Enough!   So to the people who registered (yes Colleen, you do need to register to be able to vote :), go out and vote. To those who didn't, shame on you and do remember that you will have no moral ascendency to bitch and whine about the state of our country for the next six years. Yes, you won't even have that luxury, because you did not exercise your right to vote.   However, you can redeem yourself, and up your good karma in the process too. Just volunteer for poll watching or counting and you may be able to undo some of the bad karma now hovering around you. hehehehe

         Thought for the day     "Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent.  Most talents are to some extent a gift.  Good character, by contrast, is not given to us.  We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination."  – John Luther   Wilson Lee Flores began his article in today's Business Leisure portion of the Philstar with this quote (ku-wowt).  I don't normally dwell on the Business section, a quick perusal of the other sections (including the Headlines) is usually more than sufficient before I settle in with the Lifestyle pages. However, I found myself reading and rereading Flores' article.   Check it out for yourself.  urlLink What Kournikova, Kobe & Beckham can learn from Pat Tillman.

         WAR!   Attention:  For the past 5 days (starting April 30, 2004) up to the present, our PLDT DSL connection has been extremely unreliable. Members of this household have had to play dice with chance just to be able to log on. Watching the DSL light flicker to see if our luck would hold out, has been virtually a game to place one's bets on, the odds being a paltry 1 to 8. However, there are those odd moments when the DSL light would remain glorious green and those moments are worth dying for :P.  Anyway, before I start blubbering here, I HAVE reported said inefficiency to the PLDT office. I have endured the 30 minute holds where I was made to listen to senti elevator music, punctuated every so often with "All our operators are busy at the moment. You will be attended to as soon as an operator becomes available. Your call is important to us. Please wait." Sure.  Apparently, I'm supposed to send an email (hello!) to report the error and then wait for the PLDT repair crew to swing by and make things all fine and dandy once more. It's been five days and yet no PLDT people have come knocking. My surfing powers are waning, must...get...internet...fix...NOW!  What I don't get are:  1. The nice people at 171 and 173 have consistently said that a report has already been filled out. However, they just can't follow up the repair team because they are, you know, on the streets right now. There's just no way to contact them. That would be plausible of course, except for two things: Cellphones and the fact that they're PLDT! They're only the biggest telecommunications provider in the Philippines no! If they themselves can't get in touch with their own people, what hope do we little people have?  2. How many repair vehicles does PLDT really have? One?! I just can't believe that it would take this long to pay a visit to my house (which isn't really in Batanes, for crying out loud!) and then make a cursory check up on the modem.  3. What's up with PLDT's aggressive campaign for it's DSL services when they can't even provide a reliable connection for their existing customers? Biting off more than you can chew eh?  4. Lastly, when I asked about their SOPs WRT termination of services due to supreme suckiness, I was told by a smirking CSR (in fairness, I just imagined the smirk, probably from listening to  Ice Castles  and  My Heart will Go On  as interpreted by an elevator) that there is a pretermination fee (around 3k) if one opts for disconnection less than a year after availing of the services. Hel-lo and Hell NO!  Suntukan na to .   Paging Mr. Concio, or whoever will evaluate my disconnection letter and decide on the applicability of the pretermination fee, I will not stand for this. As Creasy said in  Man on Fire : Justice is a dish best served cold.  Kind ladies of 173 and 171, we will meet again.

        Hard Won Peace  Finally, that protracted chapter in my life is over. I can now confront my ghosts and demons (of course, that doesn't mean I'll now actively pursue said ghosts and demons) without the danger of breaking down into overacting hystrionics. I've stepped off the roller coaster into the calm and serene waters of everyday living. Sure it's not as exciting nor as thrilling as a triple loop roller coaster, but it will do for now. Besides, I don't think my heart can weather another round any time soon.    So this is what being at peace with yourself feels like. Hmmm....not bad.

        Ramblings   It's Saturday night and I'm home typing this entry. The sadder thing is that it's exactly where I want to be. This whole week has been physically draining for me and so I more than welcome the chance to rest and recuperate. I've never felt this fragile since I was hospitalized for dengue fever a few years back. It's scary how your body can sometimes do a 180 on you. You think you're okay and then a few minutes later, you're in the bathroom coughing like crazy until tears start streaming down your face (thanks for the literal pat on the back toni!). Somehow, while writing this, I'm reminded of the cigarette vendor in  Amelie  and I realize just how annoying it is to listen to a litany of someone's aches and pains, so I'll just stop now.  I've decided to stop obsessing about future plans (like what I did with the Fete and my aborted trip to Bohol) because it's just like handing out an open invitation for the universe to throw a monkey wrench into your well-oiled itinerary (hello Infanta Quezon!). Besides, it's usually those spur of the moment outings that end up most memorable and usually end up happening. Somehow, I'm addicted to lists and making plans but making those plans into reality is something I still have to work on.   One sure thing though, is the Inter-C party next Saturday to be hosted by 2-C. Remember sophomores, the bar has been raised from last year's fabulous bash. Bangus and Paradox, are you sure you guys are up to the challenge? :) Last year had Bacon Ben with Beer; Tequila shots in the dark which triggered a romance; an impromptu swimming party and a trashed house. What will this year bring? Stay tuned for more news next week.  Charmaine left for Australia tonight for a three-week training session. So now I'm trying to be extra nice to Mik seeing that he has no mommy around. Instead of waiting 10 minutes before I start bugging him to get off the computer, I now wait for a FULL 15 minutes.  I look at old married couples and I envy just how comfortable they are with each other. That's exactly what I want. I want to flip my life calendar 40 years into the future and be an old fart with another old fart. We'll be reading the newspaper (I'll have the Features and he'll have the Headlines) while waiting for the grandkids to come over and I'll constantly remind him about his medications and he'll be mad at me because of my incessant nagging. Ah, bliss :)  I'm looking at a copy of  The Da Vinci Code  right now. I have no idea whose it is, just that it's right in front of me and it's killing me. It's tempting me to pick it up and leaf through it's controversial pages. But I know that once I start, I won't be able to put it down. So NO. NO. NO. NO. There's a time and place for everything, and now is not the time for  The Da Vinci Code .   Things are steady and calm. School is steady, in a frantic but predictable sort of way. But I've been assessing my relationship with my friends. I'm sad to note that I have no best buddy here in Manila. The kind I can just call and yank whenever I want to go to the mall or hang out. Somehow, hanging out has become a logistical nightmare these days, requiring a flurry of text messages to ascertain everyone's availability at a certain day and time. That's what happens when you grow up. So now I'm left without a buddy because it's either he/she's: a-at work, b-in school, c-no longer talking to me. Sigh, new buddy wanted. Anyone can apply. Preferrably someone in the Alabang-Paranaque-Las Pinas area. Sige na! Let's hang! :)  So thus endeth my ramblings.

        Meet Prof Antonio "Bote" Bautista   Bote: Can a torn panty, not owned by the plaintiff nor the defendant, be presented as evidence in court? (shuffles card and picks one out) Guballa! Answer.  Khay: Sir yes sir. A torn panty even though it belonged neither to the plaintiff nor the defendant can still be presented as evidence in court.  Bote: Really? Why?  Khay: Sir, because the torn panty is in the form of a demonstrative evidence. A demonstrative evidence is a tangible item (such as maps, diagrams and models) not directly involved in the litigated occurence...  Bote: (interrupting her and turning to the class) What do you call that panty that girls wear when they don't want their panty-lines to show when they're wearing tight pants?  Khay: S-sir?  Bote: I think it's called a V-neck...  Khay: Sir, it's called a T-back.  Bote: CORRECT! You're very good! I like you! Sit down.    A Bote quote: Class, if we were doing a strip recitation, you'd all be naked now!

        Sneaky Post   I should be studying right now. I promised to "forgive" myself for cutting property class if I immediately studied after I got home. So why am I blogging away instead of hitting the books? Have I no control?! Am I that weak-willed?! Yup and yup.   Anyway, I've always been a very forgiving person so I'm sure I'll end up forgiving myself for this transgression. As for my punishment for myself, I'll just limit my Go Nuts Donuts intake this week to 3 instead of my usual 4 (desert is very important IMHO). Grabe! I'm so disciplined it's almost bootcamp like :)  The virus that's been going around has finally hit me too. I have tonsilitis (which was aggravated by a chocolate donut earlier today  Sabi ko na nga ba wrong mistake yung donut na yon , but what a way to go...) and a persistent cough that's making it difficult for me to hide in the background during class time. I personally believe in the "no sudden movements" rule during class time. I think the professors are just jamming when they say that they call students for recitation at random, they even make a show of shuffling the cards and then pulling one out from the middle. Oh c'mon, I know that they WILL the card they want to appear. They're THAT devious.  So anyway, you can just imagine how impossible it is to play invisible when you're coughing the sticky phlegm out from your lungs.    Jill: Shit...di ako nag-aral (cough-cough). I hope he doesn't (cough) call (cough) me. (attempting to activate invisibility mode)  Prof: So who's the lucky person to be roasted today. (card shuffle) Ah, Sabitsana!    Of course, my theory hasn't been scientifically proven yet, but I can feel that it's just a matter of time before it is finally revealed that the secret requirement in order to qualify as a professor in law is a keen sense of "bulakbol radar". For how do you explain them calling on you to recite on the one and only case, out of a stack of 20, which you sadly failed to read? Coincidence? I think not.

        TGIF   I never knew that I could welcome a day with this much fervor. THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY!  The whole week has been really stressful. Although I'm an irregular student, the load being extremely wonderful (note the sarcasm) coupled with my return to carpooling, always leaves me dead tired. Right now, my idea of bliss would be to sleep for 12 hours straight without thoughts of law school intruding into my dreams. It's not like I get enough Law in the Grand Manner during the day, even my dreams are peppered with Malcolm related things. Argh!   Some people might think it's unwise that I returned to carpooling, seeing that I live in Paranaque/Las Pinas and I go to school in UP Diliman. But there's just something about living at home that dorming can never replace. Of course, it's more convenient to just board somewhere near, but I just got so lonely and miserable in my dorm room that I might have even been clinically depressed for a time there. For no matter how late I returned, I was always the first one in and being alone with my nagging thoughts was a real downer. Looking back now, I should have at least brought a radio along. Listening to the radio would have been much better than blankly staring at the walls (as I sometimes found myself doing then).  But more than the convenience that dorming brought, I wanted to stay near school for another reason. A personal reason. However, said personal reason never went beyond the platonic stage although it almost did (I think) and things were never quite the same between us ever again. At present, I would be straining the definition of a friend if I were still to call him as such. Although it's been more than a year now, I still get sad when I think about what I lost.  It's never pleasant to lose one of your bestfriends.  So if you're reading this and you suspect that it's you. Yes, it is you.

        Thank You!   Sabitski Point would like to say "Thank You!" to our favorite cousin in the world, Tessa, for generously sending over a shirt from Bohol.

        Dear Tessa,  Please stop texting me na about the fun time you're having there in Bohol no! I really don't care! So what if you're billeted in a fancy hotel, with a pool and jacuzzi and great (free) food?! So what?! It's not like I'm inggit no! Not. at. all.  Besides, it's not like I'm not having fun myself. While you're playing tourist and soaking up new sights, I've been busy myself with so many fun, fun, fun things. Like, um, reading jurisprudence on judicial notice! Grabe, you have absolutely no idea just how riveting and exciting it is to learn about the intricacies of the two types of judicial notice (mandatory and discretionary, if you really want to know). Dapat nga, you should be the one inggit of me, not the other way around. Of course, I'm just saying that as a hypothetical thingymajig. Because, as I already said, I'm so not naiinggit of you right now. So not.  I mean, it's not like I want to go swimming in Panglao (nog-nog alert); or see the Chocolate Hills (once you've seen one hill...) or have my picture taken with a tarsier (those bug-eyed yucky-kadiri mammals). That's so touristy kaya! Yuckers!  So stop na no! Or else I'll hit you na on the face with my baby pink Jelly Kelly (a certified original, not from that japex heaven Greenhills) the next time I see you.  Your Loving Cousin, Jill

        Dilemma   To my dear readers and fans (all three of you),  Sabitski Point is at a quandary at present. For the first time in months, I actually have a weekend gimmick that will make any weekend warrior proud. However, I am now faced with TWO possible gimmicks, each one equally alluring and seductive as the other. I have to choose one because they are not mutually compatible. This is where you all come in, please log in your votes, comments, suggestions with regard to the two choices soon to be laid bare before you. No comment is too insignificant nor too grand that will not be contemplated upon by my humble self.   The choices are:  A) An overnight stay at some posh resort with FREE jetski and speedboat. The whole family is going and will be spending father's day there.  B) Attending the Fete de la Musique at Eastwood. I've been wanting to go for the past two years, but it has only been this year that the opportunity to grace the event became possible. I want to have Penny Lane moments (minus the backstage services of course) and play Band-Aid the entire night and have lots of photo-ops with famous people.  So that's about it. Please, please, please put in your two cents' worth.

        Things to do   I woke up today with the most ridiculous smile on my face, I guess this silly girl was excited because this was going to be a busy day and so a list was necessary! Yey! I love making lists.  I'm not really as OC as most of the people I know (you know who you are). My notes (with my horrible handwriting) are all written in dull black (or leady-y gray); I'm happy with just one dermatograph for my books (all those bright colors give me a splitting headache); I have no strict way of arranging my things (although I do try to keep my closet color-coordinated, try being the operative word) and I firmly believe that there is something grossly unnatural about a neat and tidy room (messiness equates to character, I always say). However, the same cannot be said about me and my lists. I live to make lists (but completing all the items in the said list is another story altogether). I get a certain sense of satisfaction in putting little check marks beside each item. I feel so accomplished and so organized, which is always good.   Looking back at my old journals, I now see that they were more than the "Dear Diary" variety (although I did have a lot of cringe-worthy entries. Man! I had a loooot of crushes pala. I was so Sweet Valley High in my orientation) as they were the "Things to do", "Places to go to", "Christmas List" type. My cousin and I, one boring summer day back in 1999, even made a "Life Checklist". These were the 20 things on my list:  1. Go to Boracay (done) 2. Be a student assistant (done) 3. Work in a magazine (nope) 4. Finish college (done) 5. Tour Europe (nope) 6. Live abroad for awhile (nope) 7. Fall madly in love (done) 8. Get a teaching job (done) 9. Have something published (done) 10. Get drunk (DONE!) 11. Get a diver's license (nope) 12. Enter law school (done) 13. Learn to cook (done) 14. Wear a bikini (done) 15. Learn a foreign language (done. Je parle un peu francais) 16. Work in a cruise ship (nope) 17. Create a webpage (done) 18. Watch a Broadway play (nope) 19. Donate blood (done) 20. Travel by myself (nope)  So that's 13 out of 20 (and that's mostly because the other unaccomplished things require money, which this student still does not have a lot of.) Not bad. My nineteen year old self would have been proud.  Anyway, today is also a list-worthy day and here it is.  1. Collate readings 2. Organize sales readings 3. Buy shoes 4. Buy school supplies  5. Study transpo 6. Start on torts paper 7. Deposit CD remittances 8. Organize shoe closet 9. Clean the war room   Of course, I'm obviously going to do nos. 3 and 4 first and I have the whole weekend to do nos. 5 and 6. Just because I made a list doesn't necessarily mean that I have to accomplish everything on it right away. Making a list already shows my good faith and good intention and that's more than anyone could ever ask for.

        Homesick   These are the things I would rather be doing now.  I want to be seated at our back porch devouring this view.     I want to demolish a pizza in this place.     I want to go swimming in this beach.     I want to see the sunset from this vantage point.     I want to go back to Moalboal Cebu, where time is slower and the days gracefully blend into each other. Isn't it obvious just how homesick I am? And this post is not making things any easier.Sigh.  P.S. Sabitski point would like to give a shout-out to kuya Oliver who took the time out to call our grandparents (who are in town for their regular medical check-ups) this morning. I'll immediately inform you if I have new tsismis or balita. Isn't that what Instant Messenger is for?

        Letter of the Day   I was so happy to receive this email from my cousin/tita Ligaya (she's really my aunt, but because she's only 3 years older than me, it seems quite ridiculous to call her Tita Ligaya). I missed her wedding in Cebu (damn law school!), I missed her when she visited the house before going back to Luxembourg (damn law school!) and I'll probably miss her again when she returns to visit (damn...you know the drill :).  Anyway, this is the first email I received from her since she left for Luxembourg. I'm glad to see she's having a ball on the other side of the planet.  Ligaya writes:   Hi Jill kumusta ka na??? sayang hindi kita na meet last time....busy ka daw sa study mo.Ok lang ako dito. sa Aug.balik ako sa cebu! pero mga 3 weeks lang kasi sa sept. i´ll continue my french and german language class ...pagkatapos mag trabaho na ako para magka pera naman(heheehehe)...pero now i can speak and understand french and german(hindi pa nga lang fluent...)

        New Housemates   Sabitski Point would like to welcome the "Return of the Comeback Kids" a.k.a. my brother (Santi), sister-in-law (Charmaine) and nephew (Mick).    Of course, life would be more exciting with this gremlin back in the household 24/7. I can just imagine the future power struggles over the computer and television because Mick is addicted to www.cartoonnetwork.com (or cartoon-cartoon network as he calls it) and always stakes his permanent claim on the computer and boob-tube every time he visits, much to the chagrin of everyone around him. However, all this is still beside the general chaos that a little boy wreaks with just his immediate presence. It's gonna be an exciting year, that's for sure. Three more people in an already crowded household equates to a virtual party every day (or a very tense household. But only time will tell because, hopefully, things will be different now).  Oh yeah, and having my brother back home again is also a plus :)

        Last Hurrah   So it's the last weekend before school starts. I'm through with my yearly summer island hopping (which was cut short, no thanks to that partypooper Dindo); logged enough tv time to make even the most ardent couch potato proud ; spent quality time with my family to the point that we've become quite sick of each other and the insect bites and jellyfish stings on my arms and legs have swelled down into the most unflattering specks of brown (Note: the Godiva anti-jellyfish sting sunblock is the biggest rip-off of the season. I know of four people, including myself, who bought it but still got stung). Yup, I think I've had enough of summer. It's time to pack the swimwear and the flip-flops and air out the jackets and boots (oooh...boots! hehehehe).  Of course, I have a sneaking suspicion that less than a month into the schoolyear, I'll be retracting the above paragraph and praying for the next long vacation to harken. But as of the moment, I more than welcome the respite that school will bring. Sure.  Back to school list 1. multivitamins- kasi bawal magkasakit sa law school 2. school supplies- one of the few fun things in studying. Somehow, studying seems so much more enjoyable when you're faced with not one, but SEVEN different colored highlighters! (hi joan and juno!) 3. sense of humor- the most important sense, as one beauty contestant masquerading as a rocket scientist proclaimed. 4. a big slice of humble pie- pride? what pride? 5. happy thoughts/memories- things you can look back on when things look grim and dreary (read: midterms) 6. ice cream- mmmm....chocolate....  So there, I'm prepping myself up for the upcoming Malcolm onslaught. But before I succumb to the inevitable, I'm going out for one more gimik with the gang. As hot momma Ella said "Lubos-lubusin mo na ang saya before school starts", because come June 7, 2004, a dark cloud will once again loom over the entire Malcolm-dom and it's subjects will once again be reduced to their automated states.

        Confessions of a Choir Girl Priss    For all my talk of moving out of one's comfort zone and extending oneself to the point of discomfort, I am  sadly very content to be inside my bubble and, anyway, I have never been flexible.  Maybe it's a mixture of spending 10 years in a Catholic school + always wanting to please my parents + not being proactive enough, hence I've become this pathetic person.  Just blowing off some steam here. I can't even muster up the courage to go to UP just to see if I passed freaking administrative law. I'd rather simmer at home, anxiously biting my nails than to march up to the secretary's office and then demand for my TCG. Obviously, I'm a firm believer in the credo that "What you don't know won't hurt you."  Oh well. I'm giving myself a good kick right now (ouch!)and tomorrow I'm commuting to UP (an extra punishment for myself because Bebengski is color coded every Friday) and finally facing the music. Oh yes, I haven't been the best student in the law school world and so there are repercussions to be faced.  Law school life, oh my law school life, every second kay ganda   P.S. If you're reading this, I'm really sorry but it's not gonna work out. I was just being polite, please don't mistake that for interest.

        Brain Drain   I can't think of anything coherent to blog about. My blogger juices run dry (it's about time! some wise-ass might say).  Somehow, my blogger instincts are overriden by an impending state of doom, that being enrollment and the release of grades. Pasado kaya ako o take two na naman?! Argh!  To the incoming Malcolm freshmen, welcome to the jungle :)

        Saturday Stress   I'm so wired up today! I have a lot of things zipping through my mind. Even my dreams acted as virtual post-its of all that I'm currently anxious over.       I'm dreading the upcoming two weeks and the barrage of exams they will bring! (Papa Jesus take me now)    I'm worried about her because I've never seen her this sad and depressed before.    I'm annoyed with myself because I thought I was totally over the f*cker, but I still find myself giggling and fixing my hair in his immediate vicinity!     I joined something I totally suck at, all because I made a promise that I would join and at the time of joining I didn't realize I would be that sucky. Now I get palpitations with just the thought of going onstage, but a promise is a promise (and it doesn't help that all of my Catholic guilt kicks into overdrive at the mere mention of Charivari). I'll just watermelon my way through the ordeal (as usual).    I offered to write for the Lex mostly as a gesture of peace (I know you're reading this JP, peace na tayo right?), but now I don't know where I'm going to steal the needed time to do my piece.    I'll be driving home late again from QC tonight and that's usually enough source of stress for me.    I had money issues (which turned out to be principle-issues) with my mom yesterday and it saddens me when we fight because we're both the non-confrontational type, so we just end up giving each other the silent treatment. Sometimes I wish we could just have a scream fest and get it all over with, but I choose to assert my being a Drama Queen in other venues, not through that.     Okay, my ranting's over and done with. (exhale)    What's so great about putting everything down in writing is that I can actually confront them better than if they were just hazy nagging ideas wandering through my mind. By relegating them to paper, they become concrete and concrete things can be easily disposed of. I now wait in anticipation at the thought of crossing out those above mentioned things one by one.    That is my only source of pleasure for now. How utterly dismal.

        Doctor's Orders   I visited an optometrist today to have my glasses "upgraded". I thought it was about time, what with all the nasty headaches I've been experiencing these past few days and the fact that my current glasses are more or less 3 years old. (FYI: The rule of thumb is that one should change one's prescription eyewear once a year.     &nbsp;   Anyway, I was about to have my eyes checked when the optometrist (Nella Sarabia, probably the coolest optometrist in the Philippines) asked if I was "puyat". Duh! Law student! Lack of sleep is my middle name and Stress and Tension are my kissing cousins. So my check-up was rescheduled for tomorrow and I was instructed to get AT LEAST 7 hours of sleep.     &nbsp;   What can I do? The&nbsp;doctor's orders must be followed to a T. Sigh. Being forced to sleep, such a travesty... :)     &nbsp;   So I guess I'll be foregoing my beloved books for tonight. I'll miss you dears! Don't worry, mommy will be back before you can say Jurisprudence.

        Tumultuous Years     I don't know if I did it subconsciously or it was by mere coincidence, but I found myself watching "Thirteen" last night and after rereading my last post, I now realize just how in point that movie was to my lamentations about&nbsp;beginning to see&nbsp;things through my parents' eyes.     &nbsp;    For more info on the movie, please go   urlLink  here.         Everyone knows that the teenage years are the worst years in a person's life. There's the&nbsp;constant identity search coupled with your over-active hormones and the appalling realization that your body is&nbsp;changing virtually overnight ( what?! this wasn't here last night!!).  However, I&nbsp;now wonder if the turbulent teens phase is more of a Western import than anything else. For it seems&nbsp;to me as if the more  American &nbsp;Filipino teeners get, the more&nbsp;the term "troubled teen" becomes applicable. My parents tell of the good old days when such a thing as teen-age crisis was unheard of during their days. The rules were simple then, children followed their parents and then&nbsp;toiled to bring honor to the family name (or at the least, not to muddy it).     Back in the pre-angst era, children were expected to immediately&nbsp;become little adults. There really was no time for self-discovery and the like because the fields needed to be plowed and there was still that nagging problem of where the next meal would be coming from. But now that we're more better off, we have all this time to ponder about ourselves and our meanings in life. Isn't it great just how much we have evolved and progressed from our parents' days? :)    &nbsp;   The movie intrigued me because it also brought back memories of my own turbulent teenage years. I was the happiest kid growing up but once puberty hit and my oil glands started working overtime, I was reduced to a big mass of insecurity. All of&nbsp; a sudden, from being a cute and vivacious kid (please bear with me :) I had morphed into a zitty, skinny and klutzy teenager. So I retreated into the wonderful world of books and pretty much preferred  Nancy Drew  and the  Little House Series  over actual human interaction. Oh yes, I became (and still am) a bookworm.     But my books did not stop the confluence of emotions that swirled in me. I was mad, I was sad, I was irritable, I was snappish, I was prone to bouts of crying&nbsp;and I had no idea why. I just was. I guess I was just a teenager.    Which now brings me to parents and teenagers. I have long come to the realization that there is no exact formula in life. Much more so in raising a child. In the movie, Mel was a hands-on mother. She insisted that her children stay at home and she constantly supervised them to the best of her capability (since she also had her own demons to handle). She was an uber-cool mom. She even tried to be more of a friend than an authority figure. But that still did not stop Tracy from experimenting with&nbsp;sex, drugs and rock and roll with her new cool and manipulative&nbsp;friend. There's really&nbsp;only just so much that&nbsp;parents can do. For they can't lock their kids up until they're pretty much over and done with their teenager years. The most that a parent can actually do is to try and inculcate all the good values in their kids (but not to the point of overwhelming them) and then hope that their kids will be sensible enough to stay away from trouble or that if they do get into trouble, that it will be of the reversible kind and that there will be enough of the kid left to save.    My next door neighbors (the Villasors) have three beautiful kids (Ariana, Victa and Thomas). I think their ages are 10, 8 and 3 respectively. So&nbsp;the two girls&nbsp;will become teenagers more or less at the same time and&nbsp;I'm sure that their parents are already having nightmares thinking about the not-so-distant future when their sweet girls will suddenly transform into  *shudder*  teenagers.    Thus,&nbsp;next to stretch marks, another reason why I don't want to have kids is the horrific knowledge that my cute bundle of joy will one day be a teenager. Or maybe I can make a deal with God and just go straight to being a grandparent,&nbsp;where my only role&nbsp; would be&nbsp;that of&nbsp;spoiling my grandchildren  (Don't listen to your mommy. Here, have some more candy)  and the rearing would solely be left to the poor parents. Ah, bliss.  &nbsp;

        Through Litiginous Eyes    I commuted home from Malcolm&nbsp;today. My afternoon class got cancelled so I asked if I could hitch with the leave 230 trip and I was informed that I could. However, there was a mix-up of some sort (that would be  you  Matt Mathay), so the 230 trip left without me (cue:  I'm so wawa type of music ). Anyway, as aforementioned, I commuted and it was fairly uneventful. But upon disembarking from the bus&nbsp;at the Alabang market, I was shocked to see a man lying on the street, looking as if he was having an epileptic seizure.     &nbsp;   The man was wearing a red shirt, khaki shorts and rubber slippers. The accident must have just happened because only a small crowd had begun to gather around him. Two men then picked up the prostate man and brought him to the sidewalk. I observed that there was no blood on the street. So does that mean that the impact was not that strong and that he'll eventually be alright? Or does that only mean that he was suffering from internal hemmorrhage and the extent of his injuries was just not immediately visible?     &nbsp;   I still don't know what hit the man (if it was a bus or a private vehicle). I now wonder if contributory negligence could be attributed to him, because he was lying far away from the pedestrian lane. Meaning, if he had been crossing the road when the accident happened, he&nbsp;was jaywalking, and if there was an ordinance against jaywalking in Alabang, then he would have been held negligent. However, even if he had been jaywalking, it could also be argued that it is already common knowledge that in populated areas, such&nbsp;as the Alabang market, pedestrians dart in and out of the traffic, so the driving population should be extra cautious in such areas.     &nbsp;   But given the reality of things, I doubt that a case would even be filed. He seemed like an ordinary person with limited means (I wouldn't be surprised if he was one of those vendors who get on a bus to peddle mineral water and the like). With the way things are around here, he'll probably end up as just another statistic and by this time next week, no one will even remember that a life was lost or almost lost&nbsp;near the toll gate at the Alabang market.     After taking up Criminal Law 1 and 2 and Criminal&nbsp;Procedure, I'm almost tempted to just barricade myself inside&nbsp;the house and just order&nbsp;whatever I need&nbsp;online.&nbsp;For a quick perusal of the cases&nbsp;would immediately lead one to conclude that danger lurks everywhere. That&nbsp;just the right amount&nbsp;of alcohol&nbsp;can lead a man to commit the most dastardly act (like raping a 5 year old girl). That the&nbsp;littlest provocation can &nbsp;make a person lash out at another (slander). That a seemingly&nbsp;trustworthy person&nbsp;will not think twice about&nbsp;swindling another&nbsp;person if he thinks he can get away with it (estafa and illegal recruitment).       And I'm taking up Torts this semester, so car rides have become a virtual&nbsp;exercise in pinpointing the negligent act&nbsp;whenever&nbsp;we pass by a scene of an accident. I now take a quick scan before stepping on the sidewalk, for fear that there may be an open manhole or unfinished digsite lurking around. When I was downed by food poisoning 2 weeks ago from eating kwek2x and cheese sticks from a vendor in front of Vinzon's Hall, I seriously thought about pursuing a case against the vendor. However, I began to doubt the success of my advocacy seeing that I impliedly took&nbsp;an assumption of risk by eating at said food stall (it sure ain't the Hyatt).       So gone are my carefree days when I could just shrug off my parents' seemingly overly cautious ways and chalk it up to merely being perenially OA. Because now, I can see exactly where they are coming from. And if I were to have a kid myself, I would also probably be just as strict with her/him as they&nbsp;have been&nbsp;with me  (Nasan ka na?! Why do you make me worry about you all the time?!?).  You know you're all grown up when you already see things&nbsp;the way&nbsp;your parents do.

        Over the Hump     It's finally Wednesday afternoon! I thought the first half of the week would never end! I dread to think of just how much more similar toxic days the next few weeks would bring, seeing that midterms is practically looming across the corner. Note to self: don't hyperventilate. Breathe in and out...   I really can't think of anything to post about at the moment. I guess I could blog about school but there's just nothing substantial to say about it. It's mostly: study, study, study&nbsp;go to class and attempt to activate invisibility mode, cringe while cards are shuffled and either exhale a big sigh of relief when another person is called or experience a temporary numbness when your name is called and immediately stand up in preparation for the grilling,&nbsp;class ends and then repeat the entire thing all over again.&nbsp;You know, usual run of the mill stuff.   Maybe I'll blog about my law school crush. I think he's fourth year now. He looks Chinese, but I'm not sure if he is. I'm not sure if he can talk because I've never&nbsp;actually heard&nbsp;him talk, but I'm assuming he can because I don't think interpreters are allowed in recitation. He looks good in red. That's about it. So much for romance huh?   Oooohhh...speaking of crushes, one of my long time crushes texted me last Monday. It was really innocent though. By no stretch of imagination could I possibly impute anything romantic&nbsp;with his SMS. Anyway, that little detail didn't stop me from daydreaming about what our future children will look like and what the motif will be on our daughter Tatiana's (nickname Taters)&nbsp;1st birthday party (Lilo and Stitch or My Little Pony?). Sure it was pathetic, but it was fun and I found myself giggling like a loon the whole ride home, making the whole foray into la-la land worth it.   This is what can be considered as a pro-forma post. I just wanted to write for the sake of writing because the last time I blogged was Sunday and it kills my OC self to go two days without blogging. So bear with me while I twiddle my thumbs.    Imelda  is showing in Town! I wanted to watch this evening but in my state, I will probably just sleep through the entire screening.&nbsp;Thank goodness they decided to bring it here to the dirty South, I was again feeling  wawa&nbsp;is me  (self-pity) because I wouldn't be able to watch Ramona Diaz's controversial documentary, but now, there's no need to go into wawa mode! Yehey! I really do wish we had our own Art Film Cinema in Town or it's counterpart in Festival Mall ( asa pa &nbsp;wishing that Southmall will also dedicate an entire cinema for art films).   I can't stretch this post any more than I already have. I'll probably be sleeping in an hour or so because I've been up since 3am studying for Transpo. Sorry to seatmate Roy because he experienced first hand just how crabby and terse I can get when stressed:    Roy: Anong assignment for today?     &nbsp;   Jill: Last 6 cases.     &nbsp;   Roy: Six? Diba five cases lang?     &nbsp;   Jill: Fine! The last FIVE cases then!     &nbsp;   Roy: E ba't parang galit ka?     &nbsp;   Jill: Kasi I'm stressed.     &nbsp;  Alrighty. My work is done. My beloved blog has been updated. Jillsabs now signing off.

        Simple Pleasures     I remember reading this book for Children's Lit class called "Serendipity".      It tells of a girl who read the word  serendipity  in the paper, became fascinated with the word&nbsp;and&nbsp;was not quite satisfied with her mother's explanation, so the little girl went out&nbsp;on a quest to find out what it&nbsp;really meant. I&nbsp;have kinda forgotten exactly how&nbsp;she went about with&nbsp;her search but it more or less followed this pattern: Could serendipity be the feeling I get when I'm high up on a swing? (as she swings back and forth) Could serendipity be the leaves falling from the tree? (as she&nbsp;dances amidst the falling leaves causing the people around to also join her) Could serendipity be this little puppy in my arms? (as she nuzzles and kisses the puppy)&nbsp;and so on and so forth.  &nbsp;  So what is serendipity? The girl's mother called it&nbsp; "finding happiness in the most unlikely places", which was exactly what the little girl discovered on her search.  &nbsp;  I think that this world would be so much better if we were to find happiness in the little things around us and the little gestures of love and kindness bestowed upon us. Sure, having lotsa money and a great epic-story-kind-of-love affair is fantastic, but sharing a quiet evening&nbsp;bonding with a good friend&nbsp;can also be&nbsp;just as amazing.  &nbsp;  Call me shallow but these really  do  make me happy.       1. Knowing that my friends will listen and commisserate with me when I whine (for the nth time) about how X is so much happier than&nbsp;I am&nbsp;right now.        &nbsp;    2. My Malcolm friends and how we can just hang out for hours without doing anything at all.        &nbsp;    3. Warm brownie cup at this place in Banilad, Cebu.        &nbsp;    4. The Sunday paper.        &nbsp;    5. The start of every month, because that means new magazines!        &nbsp;    6. Driving around aimlessly with Riza and Peachy.        &nbsp;    7. Congregating at the Mojes or the Wagas when the gang's all complete.        &nbsp;    8.&nbsp;Teasing my nephew (No baby, we're not laughing at you, we're laughing with you!)&nbsp;          9. Gossiping with Tessa about our dysfunctional relatives.        &nbsp;    10. Hearing my tatay's Dolphy jokes at the dinner table.        &nbsp;    11. Watching my mother embarass my siblings as she reduces them to being 3 year olds once again (Baby! Shamangalangga-langga!) and then seeing my siblings cringe with embarassment (specially Krissy, who's the most pikon among us all).        &nbsp;    12.&nbsp;Toiletries shopping.&nbsp;        &nbsp;    13. My blog and anything about blogging in general.       &nbsp;   14. Making lists :)

        Test Results    Now these are the types of test results I like. From this   urlLink  site   .    &nbsp;     Wackiness: 44/100    Rationality: 34/100    Constructiveness: 62/100        Leadership: 46/100       You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a  hippie . You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.Please don't get even with this web site.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Remind me to start wearing peasant blouses and peace signs come Monday morning :)

        New Look   I wonder why Blogspot sprung this new look on its subscribers? It's definitely more user-friendly than the last one (I think I can now upload pix directly to it and not through the way of the Photobucket) but I miss the old format. The font I use is not in the menu of fonts and when I try to copy and paste from my past formats, they just don't come out the same! I guess I still need to figure out this new thingamajig. Good luck to me.  &nbsp;  Oh why wasn't I born with technical savvy instead of these damn good looks?! :)

        Horrible!    It was utterly horrible! This evening's traffic that is.  &nbsp;  It would usually take us around forty-five minutes to an hour to get home but today, that same amount of time only got us as far as the Ortigas intersection. If I had walked, I would have probably gotten earlier to the C5 intersection. However, surprisingly, &nbsp;the SLEX was an easy ride. I guess someone above decided that the torture of trudging from Katipunan to the C5 intersection was more than enough and so pulled a few strings (or deleted a few cars?) and made the second leg of the trip more bearable.  &nbsp;  The formula still holds true: Payday weekend + rains = monstrous traffic jam. Man I hate Manila traffic! This is the sole reason why I choose to cultivate friendships and relationships primarily with my fellow southerners. I have long lost track of the numerous gimmicks I have had to forego because the party planners set it up in Ortigas or Quezon City and me and my lonesome self would still be coming from Las Pinas/Alabang. I don't like driving alone late at night. It's just not a smart thing to do these days.  &nbsp;  As with relationships, let's just say that the next boyfriend has to come from the south too, no ifs and buts about it ( So you're from Project 4? Ummm...let's be friends na lang, pwede?).  Sure, the romantic will say that love will (or should) conquer all, even the monster known as Metro Manila traffic. But this romantic-realist-optimist-pessimist wants her quality time baby! And quality time is not the two hours&nbsp;spent trudging through a sea of automobiles.  &nbsp;  Bottom line is, traffic sucks. Big time.

        A Font-astic Romance  This made me laugh out loud. To read up on the background, please go  urlLink here.   Anyway, enjoy :)   Times New Romance is a wonderful story of two lonely individuals who find love when it's spelled out to them in a bold 72-point font. Poor graphic artist Jake Estrella hates the new member of their design team. She is a loud headstrong female who's popular with the company but is quite too much for Jake who finds Camy (short for Camilla) uncouth and illiterate (she only reads Paulo Coehlo and J.K. Rowling). He discovers her weakness for terrible fonts and sends her fake memos in Chalkboard and Marker Felt with the forged signature of their boss in hoping that the notes bring about her immediate resignation.  When this attempt fails, Jake brings out his greatest prank and re-prints all her printed documents in Comic Sans MS. Finally this gets a reaction out of Camy, although not one Jake hoped for. Camy is affected gravely and suffers a seizure and is rushed to the hospital immediately where she remains unconscious for several days. When she wakes from her font-induced coma, Jake is there. No words come from his mouth. Instead, he raises a sign with the basic 72-point font that reads: I'M SORRY. Jake is forgiven by Camy immediately and they embrace and kiss. Why? Because the simplest fonts express the deepest of feelings such as love, oh! They learn this moral lesson and delete the thousands of useless fonts they have accumulated all these years, thus freeing hard drive space and freeing themselves from font dependence. Their story gives courage to other lonely font-obsessed individuals and soon they start their popular workshops and seminars like "Superscript Your Life" and "Verdana & The Truth About You."  They spearhead an online petition to remove Comic Sans MS from seeing print in any medium, and soon even Microsoft heeds their demand.  Then their first implied tasteful love scene, and the end.   Now that's a great love story!

        Hmmmm....  I played hooky from school today, in an effort to avoid embarassing myself in school (I'm not going to elaborate any further) and amidst all the free time I had, I seriously got to thinking about volunteering again at Zobel's Adult Night High School. I could sure use the extra money and I can spare 2-3 hours per week. The last time I taught at ANHS was the year before I entered law school and it was a very memorable experience. I taught English to two sections and as the cliche goes, I learned more from my students than they did from me.  So I guess I'll be paying Ms.Telen a visit tomorrow and I'm crossing my fingers that she'll hire me again. Wish me luck!   P.S.  This is my third post for today. Somebody obviously had a lot of time on her hands this day.

        Poor Little Girl   Poor GMA. She wanted to be president so bad. She pulled strings left and right and moved heaven and earth just to be seated again in Malacanang. And now, even before the honeymoon is over, she's faced with the Angelo Dela Cruz hostage taking situation. The most apt saying to this fiasco would have to be: It's like choosing between the devil and the deep blue sea.   If she refuses to withdraw the Philippine troops from Iraq then her popularity ratings will plummet. However, if she does remove our presence in the Middle East then she will most probably displease the United States and its allied countries (as they have already eloquently hinted)   What to do, what to do...   This morning's news said that there will indeed be a troop pull-out and so the corresponding American show of displeasure was quick to come (Tsk-tsk-tsk! Bad little brown monkeys!).   That's the trouble with being the Chief Executive, you just can't please everybody. But on the other hand, she shouldn't even try to. I think that we've played the role of America's willing sidekick/servant/brownnoser for a long time now. It's time that they clean up after their own mess. After all, the Earth is not divided into America and others (or at least it shouldn't be).   GMA is probably asking herself right now: "Why did I want to be president again?"

        Post-Its  1. Stay away from kwek2x, isaw and the like. The past few days have more than adequately shown the disgusting consequences they bring.  2. If he wanted to, he would. But he didn't, so he doesn't.   3. Pana-panahon lang yan.  4. You receive in proportion to what you're willing to put out.  5. If it hurts you, cut it off (so goodbye friendster!).  6. Sure, your breath still catches in your throat, but what matters is that you choose to breathe again right after.  7. Hang-ups are only good for hanging yourself with.  8. Early mornings are the worst time to write an entry. It's so lonely and conducive to shoulda-coulda-woulda musings. Sigh.  9. Enough.

        A Comparison  Yesterday's Jill would have been extremely irritated with her mom's constant badgering to finally get her hair cut. But today's Jill would just zone out her mom's incessant nagging about how her hair tends to go limp so a short 'do suits her more; how a "pa-sweet" hairdo is not "bagay" on her blah-blah-blah.  Yesterday's Jill would have had a sassy retort ready when her mom criticized her outfit for the nth time, comparing her to a street walker (Hello! We're in a tropical country! What do you expect me to wear, a nun's habit?!?). But today's Jill would just shut her trap and bite her tonge, letting her mom finish with her ranting and then walk away when said mother ran out of steam.  Yesterday's Jill would have snuck out of the house to go out, just to avoid the impending lecture from the parents. Today's Jill would stand her ground when the sermons would start to roll and then say "Hello, 25 years old! Never been pregnant! What other proof of responsibility do you need?!"  Yesterday's Jill would have made a snide comment when the mother started talking about her religion. Today's Jill would really listen so that she'll know where her mother is coming from, in an effort to finally understand her.  Yesterday's Jill would have made some feeble excuse in behalf of the people who disappointed her. Today's Jill would do no such thing. Some things just can't be explained away.  Yesterday's Jill would have obsessed and cried over why a certain someone doesn't like her. Today's Jill would say "Kung ayaw mo, wag mo. Jerk!"  Yesterday's Jill would have insisted on wearing contact lenses even if they sometimes made her head ache like crazy, just so that she'd feel like she looked good. Today's Jill would wear coke bottle glasses and wouldn't care less.   Yesterday's Jill would have attempted to control everything open to control and would have gotten upset if things didn't go according to her daily planner. Today's Jill no longer keeps a daily planner (but she still prints out a calendar once a month just to have a semblance of organization in her life).  Yesterday's Jill would have thought "If you loved me, you'd change" and then think: "I'm so wawa". Today's Jill would say "Kung ayaw mo, wag mo. Jerk!"  Yesterday's Jill saw things in black and white. Today's Jill sees that nothing is clear-cut and certain. Thank God.  Yesterday's Jill lived in a bubble. Today's Jill still lives in a bubble BUT already acknowledges the existence of said bubble.  Yesterday's Jill would stiffen up when people complimented her. Today's Jill can handle compliments with panache while saying "Thank you. But tell me something I don't know"  Yesterday's Jill cried the first time she watched "I Am Sam". Today's Jill still blubbers while watching that movie.  I guess the point of this self-serving blog entry is that I've finally become comfortable in my own skin (large pores and all). And all I can say is, it's about time.

        Father and Son    I wanted to post a better pic of my brother and nephew, but apparently, the Mandala pix weren't uploaded or something. So this will just have to do.  Anyway, the two are currently in Agta, Biliran right now. Living away from the hustle and bustle of the city life and with their own pre-established missions.  Santi: to dig for hidden gold in Tinago Mik-Mik: to detoxify his system from too much addiction to computer games  Hmmmm...something tells me that it would be far easier to strike it rich than to expect Mikael to give up his computer games.  Anyway, my dad called up his brother there and basically gave Tito Sandy the go-signal to discipline Mik-Mik if ever he starts acting up again (brat alert!). However, we were surprised to learn that he had been, and I quote, "perfectly well-mannered" ever since they arrived in Agta. It seems as if on their first day there, he fell into the fishpond and so has been less makulit than usual and would actually listen to his dad! Well, miracles do happen after all.   Poor baby...hehehehehe

        Dear You,  One thing you have to know about me is that I "love hard" but, I don't "hate hard". Instead, I just ease the offender out of my Life Radar. It's because I believe that the opposite of love is apathy.  I also don't believe in communicating, I personally think it's a waste of time, I stick with my tried and tested "Rule of Three" (I don't tell a story more than 3 times; I forgive only up to the third time; I let myself be used only for 3 times). I know Jesus prescribes forgiving seven times seven (or something to that effect), but I'm no God, I'm a goddess wehehehehe.  But I digress. Let me establish the fact that with you, I even managed to go beyond my usual Rule, so that should give you an idea of just how much I valued your person. However, though exceptions are sometimes to be admitted, the general rule should still be upheld. So please note that from now on you no longer exist for me. If ever I do acknowledge your presence, know that it's mostly pro forma and for the sake of being polite.  It was nice knowing you.

        Scammers at Work  Yesterday was Maha's birthday and Maha is Prof. Bote's favorite student in our block, so a scam was immediately concocted by the scammers and jammers collectively known as C2006. A "reliable source" told us that Prof Bote's class last year threw a party during class time and he gamely went along with the festivities (meaning no class for that session!).  So Ian called Pizza Hut and had some pizzas delivered to the Ambion Room. Some kind soul also took the initiative to write "Happy Birthday Ms. Llamas!!" on the white board. Unfortunately, there were a few kinks in our plan. First, we weren't sure if the pizza guy would arrive before the Professor and, most importantly, the birthday girl was missing! We were all afraid that she was going to cut class to spend some QT with her boyfriend. Anyway, Plan B was quickly hatched, so if Maha was indeed going to ditch Evidence that afternoon, the "Happy Birthday Ms. Llamas!!" on the board, was going to be changed to "Happy Birthday Ms. Dimaano!!". Ms. Dimaano happened to be our Professor's second crush, next to Maha. However, there was no need to switch to Plan B because Maha, being the trooper that she is, showed up 2 minutes before 2pm and the pizza guy a minute before her.  Maha was quickly appraised of the plan of attack. The basic plan was that she would walk in a few steps ahead of the Professor so by the time he entered the class, we would be in the middle of singing the birthday song. She waited in the corner and a look-out was posted on the other side of the Hall. When the look-out gave the signal, she hurried inside and we started with our song.   When he entered, albeit a little belatedly because the College Secretary caught up with him outside the room, necessitating a second round of the birthday song, Maha asked him "Sir, if you're hungry, we ordered some pizza for the class." Judging from his girth, you'd think that he wouldn't turn down a free slice, but apparently, he had just come from the new faculty canteen, and he kept on raving about how good the food was and how much it looked like a hotel dining room.   But seeing that it was Ms. Llamas' birthday, he offered to sing her a song. With a few caveats to the class about how his taste might be a little antiquated for our generation, he then proceeded to serenade Maha with something that went like  "My beloved...the moon on your face...you will always stay young to me...".  I had no idea what that song was but it didn't matter, I was laughing so hard that I probably didn't even catch the rest of the lyrics.   Anyway, we ended up having class that afternoon (boooo!) and I got called for recitation pa (double boooo!) so the failure of this scam brought a couple of coulda-shoulda-wouldas to mind.  1. We should have stacked the pizza boxes on the teacher's table and not at the corner of the room. 2. When should timed it so that we were in the middle of eating when the Prof arrived, that way, he would have been forced to wait for us to finish or he would have joined the merry-making. 3. The scam worked last year because they had balloons. We should have had more foresight and also put up balloons and streamers. Party hats for everyone would have also been great. 4. Aman is not a reliable source.  This also proves that students will resort to  anything  just to have a free day.  But it wasn't a total loss, we still feasted on the pizza after class. And in fairness, pizza still tastes good even when cold. However, it would have tasted so much better if it had been coupled with an Evidence-free Monday. Sigh, oh well, next time.

        Prophetic Feeling  I woke up today amazingly rested and energized. I spent all day of Sunday sleeping and reading "The Da Vinci Code". So I guess it's safe to say that I'm battle ready for the upcoming week.  Upon waking up, I had the strongest feeling that this week would a be generally a good one. I'm not sure in what way, but just that it would be different, in a good way. I then went down to the computer room BUT it took me around 50 tries to log on! So now I'm thinking, was my intuition off track? Is this really going to be a good day/week? Or judging from the difficulty in logging in, is the Universe trying to tell me to reign in my optimistic mood because this week is going to be a doozy?  I love being fatalistic. I get to discard my being Type A for at least a few moments :)  On another note, the Inter-C party was great! Kudos to 2C for sponsoring the event. Not to brag or anything (hehehehe) but the C parties are known for being fun, rowdy and noisy. You know, the good things in life.   The most memorable moment for me would have to be the Stripping Game. The general rule is that every item of clothing corresponds to a certain amount of money. So the more pieces of clothing you plunk down in your designated heap, the more money your team gets. So the boys started stripping off their shirts (it was then I realized that the Malcolm boys need to work out more, seriously!) and harassing anyone who was too shy to remove theirs. Prompting Woowee to say "Guys! We don't need the money that much!" in response to Garth and Johnny wrestling with him in an effort to remove his shirt. But this wasn't about the money, it was about block pride!  I immediately took off my shoes and socks (20 pesos) and dumped then in our pile. However, I was kinda worried when I saw that the other piles were bigger and that some guy was removing his pants (50 pesos!). So when a bra was produced by the sophomores, I started assessing my blouse to see if I would be committing a public scandal if I were to do the same and I tried to remember if I had a good, "pretty" bra on (because if it was to be displayed, it might as well be display-worthy). Apparently, the choice really wasn't up to me anymore because Toni suddenly wrestled me from behind and removed my strapless bra. So we had 60 pesos more for our pile! Yahoo!  The funnier thing was that I guess Toni felt guilty for her strong arm tactics that she eventually removed hers too and even made a public celebration out of it. But as I told her, I wasn't mad, not the slightest bit "Konting kalabit na lang no, tatanggalin ko na rin naman e!" hehehehehe  So anyway, our block did win. Go 3c! And we accepted our 260p prize with Tupas of 4c shouting from the audience: "Ang lalandi niyo juniors!" I ended up with 50p for my contributions. Block pride and toll fee, definitely not a bad deal in exchange for a bra, socks and shoes :)  So to the freshmen, please remember this Inter-C tradition (the fun parties, not really the stripping game). The bar was raised last year and it was adequately met this year. The challenge is now with you to sustain our pristine reputation. :)

        I'm just so tired.  It's not even the physical kind of tired (although I am currently that too), it's the "I-don't-want-to-get-out-of-bed-and-go-through-another-day" kind of tired.  I just want to curl into a little ball on the sofa and watch tv the whole day while eating potato chips and M&amp;Ms.  I want to wake up without a mental checklist of the things to do for the day.  I want to go through one day without hearing the words "bitch" and "slut" from someone. We're friends so it's supposed to be alright, but it's not. Just call me sensitive then.  I don't want to go to choir tomorrow but I'll probably end up with enough guilty feelings for three people if I don't go. Bahala na.  I'm so tired I don't even want to think of a title for this post.  Tomorrow is Ayeese and Ryan's themed anniversary party. That should drag me out of my doldrums. I hope.  I wanna go on vacation!!!!  I'm tired.

       Dear Fellow Malcolm Law Students,  It has come to the attention of my good person that you have once again desecrated the venerable name of our esteemed institution. What am I talking about? I am talking about that bacchanalia of banality called "Freshman Night".  For the life of me, I really don't comprehend what sort of pleasure you derive from participating in said insipid activity. Sure, you get a few laughs (alright, admittedly a LOT of laughs), but after that, what else? Did you find that your knowledge of substantial law has increased tenfold? Or that your mastery of remedial law suddenly rivals even that of Baltic, I mean Prof. Antonio Bautista? Of course not! Ergo, I conclude that it is as worthless an activity as, say, the Moot Court (Because hello! You're arguing on something that's already, you know, moot and academic! Hello! Earth to UP Law!).  However, as it is more than painfully apparent that you are not willing to give up this whole affair cold turkey (it saddens me to see how the weak-willed hold on to their vices with an iron grip. Sigh.), I have taken it upon my benevolent self to introduce a few improvements to what you have deemed as "Freshman Night". I sincerely hope that you will take my suggestions to heart, specially when placed vis-a-vis with what actually happened last July 31, 2004.  1. I suggest that we retain the Freshman centric theme, thus continue with it being called "Freshman Night". However, rather than making our newest brothers and sisters dress in drag and showcase their singing and dancing talents, we should all just line up side by side, Freshmen on the right and all the upper classmen on the left, and then we introduce ourselves to one another, all along saying "Welcome! Welcome!". After this rousing bit of introduction, we all settle down and listen to a reading from one of Justice Panganiban's decision. Pure intellectual bliss...  2. I will never be able to understand why those poor freshies allowed themselves to be dressed up in women's clothings and then have their faces slathered on with the loose woman's war paint, make-up. And then they even caroused on stage wearing nothing but a bikini top and a barely there bottom (of course, some of them looked good without their shirts on...But that's beside the point!). So as an alternative to all this hulabaloo, I would have to refer you to the previous number.  3. As for the talent portion, I suggest that we totally scrap that out altogether. I mean we are in law school for a reason right? The reason being that we have absolutely no talent in singing or dancing, because if we did, we wouldn't be slaving away in this salt mine for four years. I mean, what was up with that monologue? Sure dear, they were laughing their guts out while you were performing, but how sure are you that they weren't laughing AT you rather than laughing WITH you? Think about it.  4. With regard to the intermission numbers from the five blocks, what exactly did you intend to accomplish with the fact that: 1A could do a mean "Pearly Shells" complete with accompaniment. Or that the 1B people can dance the swing while their well-crafted video presentation played on. Or maybe that 1C and 1E are great dancers. Or perhaps that the 1D girls could give the Hot Babes a run for their money. What do you want to prove? That your batch is overflowing with talent and that the upperclassmen should already start preparing for the upcoming Malcolm Madness? Alright! Point taken! Next issue please.  5. As for the winners, I only have this to say to you: Incriminating Evidence.  I could go on and on about how I would change this orgy of freakish fun but I have more important things to do (i.e. read my cases and underline them with my four different colored dermatographs. Red for the facts; Yellow for the issue; Orange for the holding and Pink for the ratio). So please do take my comments under consideration and remember that we are in UP to be serious and great lawyers and not to have fun. Because if it were the latter, then what would be inscribed in the main hall would not be the revered words of Justice Holmes, rather it would be something along the lines of "Party! Party! And more party!" We wouldn't want that, now would we?  Sincerely Yours, A Concerned Student  P.S. Some of you might ask how I got my information about this year's Freshman Night. Ummm...I refuse to answer said question on the ground that it may later on incriminate me.        *Note: This is my take on last Saturday's "Freshman Night" and my contribution to the Malcolm Lex (official school paper of the UP College of Law). I sure hope I don't get any hate mail :)

        Disturbing    I usually do not make it a policy to be affected by some thoughtless comment but I just couldn't take this one lying down (or sitting down, to be more accurate).     For the second time in two weeks (and I only see this person once a week, so her batting average is near perfect) I heard her comment on the way the Fine Arts people dress. Her past comment went something like "Why do those FA people dress so weirdly?" and tonight's winner was "She was a weirdo, obvious ba? Look at the way she dressed!".I really don't know why people feel the need to rag on the way other people dress, specially those from the College of Fine Arts. And the funny thing is that these so-called "Fashion Police" are no fashionistas themselves. If there was a pigeonhole for fashion, they would be in the "safe, so-so and bland" category.     Apparently, with that last comment I just about lost my moral authority to blog about the evils of judging people by the way they choose to garb themselves. But I won't stop, because it really irks me when someone passes judgment just because of another person's choice of clothing. Statements like "You look like a (insert derogatory comment here) in that top!" should forever be banned and those who uttered them should be hung from the ceiling by their thumbs. It is exactly this mode of thinking which perpetuates such warped notions that a woman deserved to be raped/harassed/wolf-whistled/felt-up or other whathaveyous just because she was dressed provocatively or she acted like a (insert derogatory comment here).    To all those who still think in such a manner, please do grow up.    And to the above mentioned "fashionista", if the FA people are weird just because they don't conform to some standard you've already set in your mind (the set standard being your own manner of dressing and sense of fashion) then I'd rather be labeled alongside the weirdos rather than fashion (pun intended) myself to what you deem as normal. For if you're what's normal, then I'd rather be with the freaks and the retards thankyouverymuch.    God forbid that we should all try to be our own individuals and not blend in with the rest of the flock.
