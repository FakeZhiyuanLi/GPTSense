      I sit poised at my computer.&nbsp; I should be adding one&nbsp;number&nbsp;to another number and muttering things about effective tax&nbsp;rates.   But no...&nbsp;   I am rebelling.      Well - Ok - &nbsp;rebelling but in&nbsp;a small way.&nbsp; I am blogging.&nbsp; And for the first time too! Woo hoo.

      The management of The Bailowdown would like to make it clear that they are in no way associated with  urlLink contemporary Greek dancing.   Any potential students of Yo Bailo should proceed with extreme caution.  Seek the opinion of your local  urlLink healthcare provider , make sure your  urlLink affairs are in order , then throw back a shot of ouzo for luck and let the sound of the  urlLink bouzouki  take you over.  Ok - think I've got the hang of links now...

      Work is going SLOWLY this week.  It seems like it will never be Friday.  I'm sure its been Thursday 3 times already this week already.  Yet there are still 2 more days to go!!    Actually its not really the work thats draging - its the fact that I've got something BIG to look forward to on the horizon.  Just booked flights to the USA.  Woo Hoo.  Fly into San Diego on the 15th of September.  Fly back from Las Vegas on the 1st of Oct. Nothing else is sorted out - but I'm sure it will all be fine.  I havn't been to the west coast US before and I am jolly excited.  I have visions of hiring a big convertible and seeing as much of the country as I can in a short space of time.  Got to leave room for an Elvis tribute in Vegas though.  It would be rude not to!

      I've found  urlLink this  news article  which scares me no end.  I think if i start walking now by the time I'm 47 i'll have burnt off all the MacD's cals that I've eaten.  But i could be wrong as the study does not include Mcflurries.  Oh dear oh dear oh dear.

      Last weekend was a bit of a stressy one.  How do you tell long-standing friends that you are dealing with your big secret demon?  How do you tell people that you have shared many many happy times with that you have been holding back?  That you are gay and sorry for the deception that has been a central part of your friendship?  Answers on a postcard please.  The Bailo approach has varied, a couple of times over dinner with a bottle of wine, a few more over a cheeky-pint-after-work.  This weekend it involved a sunny afternoon in a riverside Nottingham pub.  As I've already said it also involved many of my best friends - which made it a BIG DEAL to me.  Most importantly though it involved wonderful people who were humblingly great and understanding about the whole thing.  They just cared about their friend being happy in his life.  Why was I so worried that they wouldn't react that way?  So now for honesty on the blog too.  Chances are if you have found your way here you won't be too surprised about the gay thing.  If you are - oops sorry.  Meant to tell you face to face but probably havn't seen you for a while.  I just don't want to start off dishonestly in the virtual world - tried that in the real world and it wasn't much fun!!

      Ok - so been a bit quiet on the blog front. Sorry. Having set the damn thing up I then promptly forgot my password. Sad but true.  Passwords are a bit of a peril of modern life. You end up with so many of the blasted things that they all end up written down on a post-it note somewhere. Lose the post-it and the blog is silenced!  Fortunately, I remembered my password after a drunken evening. Yay alcohol I love you. Unfortunately by that point I'd couldn't quite recall my username. Sadder but just as true.  A few emails to the lovely chaps at Blogger support and I'm sorted. Blog up and running. No reason not to post. Hurrah!
