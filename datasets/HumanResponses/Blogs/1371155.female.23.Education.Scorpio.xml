						   Interesting article, link via Kitabkhana, on  urlLink Nigerian literature . Wonder if its a model that will follow the Indian one. I suspect its going to be that way, but the markets changed entirely, so itll be interesting to watch. Also read this feature in the Guardian on  urlLink great unfinished films &nbsp;which made me wish i knew more...and a nice article from the BBC on  urlLink Tolkien's reviews 50 years ago . Which just goes to show that none of the Moorcock-esque critiques of Tolkiens work are particularly new. Its just the racism thing which isnt discussed at all - but then again the reviewers there, like the ones here, were all circuit/circle/club types anyway. Multipolycultureliterariomniopinionatism has a lot to answer for.  The trailers for the  urlLink new Batman  are out. Apparently this is all dark and scary and everything. Good. Lots of follow up links on the page too. Christian Bale should be all intense and muscular, and the advantage of wearing a mask is that no one will have to see that the top half of his face doesnt move much either. Rest of the cast sounds super...Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Ken Watanabe, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer...good lord.  Hmm. saw the trailer, which says nothing. presumably the dark and mysterious and sinister grey/brown/black/blue theme is supposed to be impressive. Will wait for it.  More interesting stuff: On the Hill website, an article about how Putu's main man Ali G did in  urlLink another hapless politician . But what is a definite mustread is this page about  urlLink ninjas

						   of the office, Putu casts a supercilious eye about and settles down for a morning read.  What delights me is the spirit, if not the letter of this book that's come out in France that encourages people to  urlLink do as little work as possible . Yet another book Putu would have written if Putu could have taken time off from being absolutely fabulous.  The BBC's entertainment page has a story about  urlLink complaints to the BBC  that sounds a lot like the Monty Python skit of the same name    Complaints   (Flying&nbsp;circus season 2...from montypython.net)    Dr Cream   I would like to take this opportunity of complaining about the way in which these shows are continually portraying psychiatrists who make pat diagnoses of patients' problems without first obtaining their full medical history.   Cut back to milkman with doctor.   Milkman  (handing over yogurt) Mind you, that's just a pat diagnosis made without first obtaining your full medical history.  Cut to man at desk.   Man  I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified.  Cut to Dr Cream.   Dr Cream  Are you referring to me?  Cut back to man.   Man  Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.  Cut to Dr Cream.   Dr Cream  Oh yes, I noticed that too.  Cut to BALPA man.   BALPA Man  These are not British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.  Cut to man.   Man  Sorry.  Cut to BALPA man.   BALPA Man  They are in fact British Sugar Corporation Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint.  Cut to Dr Cream.   Dr Cream  Yes, that'll teach him.  Cut to BALPA man.   BALPA Man  However, I would just like to add a complaint about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very tedious for the average viewer.  Cut to another man.   Another Man  I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it.  (the sixteen-ton weight falls on him)&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Anyway, there's also a nice profile of  urlLink Spike Lee  on NYTimes. And one in the Independent on  urlLink Daniel Pennac . The Independent also carries an interesting story on the super-sales of  urlLink The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time . Hey, nice books page on the Independent. Will add to template. The Not-so-secret diary of Putu the Cat is now on Blogshares. Invest, invest!

						   Putu is thrilled to read this very positive  urlLink review of Catwoman  in the Guardian; Putu saw the trailer during a trip to see spidey 2 (yes, again) and was most enchanted by Ms Berry's cat.  Another movie that Putu recommends highly, though it has nothing to do with cats and is a thoroughly bad movie, is Barbarella, Queen of the Galaxy, starring Jane Fonda and a host of other bad actors.     The classic climax sequence where the villain tries to kill Barbarella by playing a piano that has sex with its victims till they die (Ms. Fonda takes it all and wants more and the piano explodes in flames) is truly one of the best sequences of 20th century  filmmaking.   So, you escaped the birds!Just as well. It is my turn for some amusement.Come with me.This way, please!-  What is this thing? -  You will soon see, my dear. It's... sort of nice, isn't it? Yes. It is nice... In the beginning.Wait until the tune changes. It may change your tune as well. Goodness, what do you mean? When we reach the crescendo, you will die... of pleasure.Your end will be swift, but sweet... very sweet.What is this? I don't believe it.It couldn't be!Wretched girl... What have you done to my excessive machine?You've undone it. You've undone me. Look, look!Energy cables are shrinking. You've turned them into faggots.You've burned out the excessive machine. You've blown all its fuses.My goodness!You've exhausted its power. It couldn't keep up with you.Incredible! What kind of girl are you? Have you no shame?Shame! Shame on you! You'll pay for this.I've got something for you. You'll wish you had died of pleasure.Now you shall learn the wisdom of the lash.Haven't you done enough to me?I'll do things to you that are beyond all known philosophies.Wait until I get my devices.  The movie is based, of course, on the comic strip     In other news,&nbsp; urlLink R2D2  has been voted the worlds favourite droid. And even the New York Times has discovered, suddenly, that a lot of  urlLink movies are being made from comics and graphic novels . Interesting slideshow on their site chronicling  urlLink lowbrow stoner comedies   On second thoughts, its quite bad, but hey, Putus put up the link anyway.    &nbsp;

						   At an unearthly noctural hour Putu discovered the  urlLink online edition of Granta  and spent the next few hours devouring the  urlLink extracts  that are available online. Putu in particular would like to recommend,  urlLink Granta 77: What we Think of America , which has a series of marvellous essays, including two by Amit Chaudhuri and  urlLink Ramachandra Guha.  It ought to be read in conjuction with  urlLink Granta 84: How America Sees the World . Unfortunately to read most of the articles you need to subscribe, i.e. pay, which Putu will certainly not do. But if that's depressed you, you can always turn to the  urlLink features section  to cheer you up and look at  urlLink what Granta was reading in 2003 .

						   Besides all that angelic excitement, Putu has been catching up on the reading as well. And speaking of reading, Hurree Babu on Kitabkhana has blogged an interesting list of  urlLink books to be read twice (or not).  And BookSlut links to an article in SFGate that ponders the immortal question,  urlLink Why aren't butt-kicking superheroines getting film debuts?  A question rendered interesting by its timing, coinciding with the release of Catwoman. Putu shakes a weary head at all desperate-to-fill-space journalists (part of Putu vaguely remembers being one). Though  urlLink this cartoon  is interesting. But best link of the day by far is this extract from a book on the Guardian website. I'd tell you what it was about, but I'm  urlLink too lazy  to type any more.

						   Yesterday Putu sat in Calcutta, feeling incredibly whole, and watched Charlies Angels 2: Full Throttle. A part of Putu felt like Putu had seen the movie before, but for another part, it was as if it were the first time.   Charlies Angels 2, Putu insists, is one of the great movies of all time. True, the script and plot leave something to be desired, but for non-stop, all-fetish-encompassing, multi-coloured in-your-face high-octane double-barrelled explosive entertainment, there can be nothing else. So much beauty, crammed together on just one screen....brilliant.

						   ...that is the rather appropriate blurb for rather extraordinary debut novel- Star by Pamela Anderson. From  urlLink all accounts  it seems like a semi-pornographic story about an aspiring starlet called Star Wood Leigh who wears skimpy t-shirts with messages such as "Shuck me, suck me, eat me raw" and aspires to make it big in Hollywood. Ms Anderson admits that the story is  urlLink partly autobiographical  and that the name of the protagonist is the name she would have adopted had she been a porn star, and then provides this fascinating insight: "Somebody told me once that you figure out your porn name by taking the name of the first pet you ever owned and combining it with the name of the first street you ever lived on."  Despite the rather thin storyline, the debut novel has quite obviously generated  urlLink some media interest  (perhaps because it features her topless on the cover and contains a fold out nude photo of herself)  and the Independent even  urlLink admits  that as far as trash goes, it's not all that bad, and she herself is quite pleased that she need not  urlLink take her top off  to get people to say that it's not all crap.

						   To date, Putu's most creative plot for a best selling novel came in the middle of the night in a Glasgow hotel..but never having managed to actually to write that novel, Putu is most heartened to see this  urlLink latest enterprise  by Sam Brown and Caroline Jupp. Titled The Library of Unwritten Books, this mobile collection will contain unwritten gems such as The Man who was Addicted to Seeing and Scrumping in Persia. Carried around in a little trolley this art exhibition, which is what this really is, will be on at the Aspex Gallery in Portsmouth till August 28, which means...ahem, that there is little chance of Putu personally visiting it. Which makes me wonder why no one's ever done this online before....a blog in fact, would be a good place to start. So if any fellow Putuian has an unwritten novel that they can't quite get across to Brown and Jupp in time, Putu would be glad to blog it.

						   Books about lies and books that lie- 'fake' books of various kinds have been in the news.  While most of Putu's erudite readers would be familiar with the  urlLink story of Norma Khouri  and her book about honour killing in Jordan, a new book about lying has just hit the bookshelves. Linda Greenlaw who was denied the opportunity of starring in the The Perfect Storm with George Clooney has written a book titled " urlLink All Fishermen are Liars' . A fisherwoman by profession, in a tough male dominated world  urlLink she chronicles  the exaggeration and lies that a characterises a fisherman's world. In her own words: "And it's not only the quantity of fish that gets twisted, it's also the location where they were caught and the type of gear, bait and technique I found successful," she writes. "Hell, I have even been known to stretch the weather report to my advantage." But the NYT has been  urlLink less than kind to her  and suggests that while she is "a terrific spinner of sea stories", "On dry land, where drama is not as reliant on the threat of physical peril, she is awkward and uncomfortable describing her emotions."

						   The Kuwaiti government in all its wisdom has banned  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  for exposing links between the Bushes and the Bin Ladens. All the evidence that Moore presents and more has been catalogued in Craig Unger's House of Bush, House of Saud and Putu recommends  urlLink this review  by Martin Jacques in the  urlLink Guardian . Interestingly, in a related development,  urlLink Amazon UK  has refused to carry the book on its website. As  urlLink this article  points out, this is more than baffling because the book is available on its  urlLink US site , and can be ordered to the UK by someone in the US. And given the general litigious nature of life in America, Putu can't help but wonder why Amazon is more worried about being sued in the UK than in the US. Frankly Putu can't quite figure out why Amazon should be sued at all....but then again maybe all the butterscotch icecream I've had today has made my brain a trifle slow..........

						   Putu recommends that you read  urlLink this interview  of Amitav Ghosh by Indrajit Hazra and take particular note of this bit:   "There is also the more obvious ecological message in your book. How seriously were you trying to impart it to the reader?     Ecological destruction does bother me. But I’m a writer, not an activist. So for me, it was a concern that I firmly placed within my story. The problem in India is that the State’s ecological programmes are sometimes lopsided. People are not allowed to gather honey from regions of the forests as it will disrupt the ecological balance. But then how do they earn their living? The root of the people-environment problem is left untackled."  Not sure if he's saying something nasty about Ms Roy, and it's unlikely that Amitav Ghosh would. But he makes a subtle point about the 'duty' of the writer that rather different from one the one which Ms Roy makes about the need for writers to be activists as well.
