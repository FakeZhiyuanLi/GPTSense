      So I'm sitting here in IT, on my own, surrounded by people. Smike went well. Random people come up to me when I'm at school and compliment me on my performance, but it's not the same withought Hector and Kathryn and all the others. I'm so lame. I seem to have no life of my own. The moment I'm on my own I go to my form room and sit there with the tangled mess that is my thoughts. I guess that I need other people a lot more than they need me. So what else is new.  On a random note, I am now constantly looking for spam on my blog, and in my inbox because Chris Waring asked for my email adress, which by the way is tru_neutral@hotmail.com, and for the adress of this site.  I'm all out. See ya. xxx

      So, as anybody who knows me knows I had a party last friday. Weel, I didn't get p1ssed which was good seeing as I had a theory exam the next morning. I only had a couple of Archers Aqua, a couple of beers so I was ok. I love Archers Aqua. Its sooo nice! I must have been a little pissed though, because In a game of spin the bottle I got off with 3 people, two of which were girls.  1. Kathryn, as in mrs Squeers (who is a great kisser) 2. Jenny (who is a baaad kisser) 3. Hector (I didn't get off with him properly though)  I feel grief for him, I cannot seem to help it, I wish to do more violence  I love angel, and Illyria. It doesn't help that it was the last ever Angel on saturday. Lame. Poor Wesley.  Gotta go to lameass registration know *bangs fists* See ya xxx

      And to think that this morning the worst of my worries was not being able to see all my friends at drama again. I guess that you really should never say things can't get any worse. They always do. It seems that what happened on the bus is going to happen again on a much larger scale. The school. I can't believe it. 'They' said they'd drop it. It was a stupid mistake. Bastard!

      So, I'm siiting here in the office, writing a blog and eating sherbert lemons after getting back from a Smike rehearsal. There is less than a week to go and I am scared sh1tless. I hope I don't mess up. WISH ME LUCK! I had a huge long post to write (3 sides of A5) but it wasn't meant to be, because I seem to have lost it. Oh well. I love Sherbert Lemons, do do do! I am very pleased with the responce to my new blog, but I think I might change. I think i might be indecisive, but I'm not quite sure. Did ANYBODY watch big brother? There was a fit guy in a th0ng, but I'm sure that would've been enough to inspire Patrick to watch it, but the ever-cynical patrick probably hates it.  He's so fit. The guy in the th0ng i mean not Patrick. See ya. I love y'all

      So Chemistry was lame today. I came into IT during the lesson. Maya and Patrick were in here, which was cool. I actually did work, which is always a first, and I did a page for my Chemistry Analysis. Lame. MY MUSICAL IS NEXT WEEK TODAY!!! I'm gonna die so badly. I don't know all my lines yet, but I know most, I haven't even done one of my songs. I'm the lead and I hate surreya because she just hijjacked my computer and posted and I had to edit it. Lame. I spelled her name wrong on purpose by the way. I say Lame too much. Lame. I wonder how Kathryn did on her French exam. She must have finished by now... Speaking of French exams I swear I have my listening (Which I will fail) next. La... Not good. I love this new blog. It's so cool. I can say whatever I want on it, it looks respectable (not as good as scribblejournal but much better then my old blogontheweb, unlike Yas's which looks amasing. WINDOWS XP), and it has a decent comment system, so make the most of it!  WOO!

      So, faithful blog readers... You have succeeded in your endeavors to find and start to read my blog! You obviously have no life. Wooo posting. So lately I have been really stupidly spending a hell of a lot of credit texting Matt Foster, Josh (Who goes to my drama) and Rachel (who also goes to my drama). Yeah, so I now forget that I have a limit of credit. HI MATT! My entire class thinks I'm hung, which is quite disturbing!
