      Hi!!!  This week, we (i.e. Part II people) didn't really do much, because of Sabbaticals and after-school activities that happened to happen on Tues and Thurs...   But during recess, we had a rehearsal, and also working on lines...   I just hope that everyone will turn up when it's their turn to rehearse (provided they've got some urgent matters...) :)

         Hello&nbsp;everyone!  This is Miss Ng here *waves madly*   Thanks for your contributions and honest feedback so far.    For a start, I'd like to put on record my gratitude to VERONICA and MICHELLE who have done a wonderful, wonderful job in leading us through the conceptualisation and rehearsals of BSD. THANK YOU and because of you both and everyone else who have&nbsp;been so committed, be it in acting, publicity, design, we are going to put up a fantastic play!        And as Shaoming reminded me, thank you to CHENG SHAN&nbsp;for leading the Chinese cast. I have complete faith that the 3 parts will come together beautifully by end of August!    Some of you have highlighted that we only have a month or so left, so things are taking on greater urgency.    And these are some very URGENT MATTERS TO ATTEND TO:     1) PROPS AND COSTUMES     - We need to confirm the props and dimensions of props by end of this week then start getting them constructed so that they can be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.    - For costumes, designs for all characters must be confirmed by early next week please. If we need to custom-make some of the costumes, it will take at least 3 weeks, so please get the costume designs done soon.    - A list of hand props must be confirmed ASAP too.     &nbsp;    2) PUBLICITY     - We will start publicity and ticket sales in about 2 weeks' time. This week, we'll be printing posters and we'll start with publicity and ticket sales within the school. Posters will be put up and ticket order&nbsp;forms will be given to each class.&nbsp;Subsequently, we'll 'invade' other schools&nbsp;to set up ticket booths&nbsp;in about a month's time.    - For school publicity, we need to think of a captivating way of introducing our play to the whole school during flag-raising, so start thinking ok?      3) COMBINED REHEARSALS     -We must run through the whole play (all&nbsp;3 parts) in about 3&nbsp;weeks' time. Music&nbsp;must be confirmed by then too.    - For rehearsals in the AUDITORIUM, I managed to get 3 dates: 3 Sept, 6 Sept and 8 Sept.They will be booked for about&nbsp;4 hours each time from 12 to 4p.m. Be prepared for intensive rehearsals everyday of the Sept hols for the last lap!          4)  AOB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        - Let's start taking photos of the rehearsals and other prep work so that we have lots of photos to choose from for the programme booklet/exhibition/our own memories.&nbsp;     - We'll print the posters and tickets on our own to cut down costs. For the programme booklet, we'll ask a professional printer to print about 500 copies and these will be given to members of the audience who give a token donation. Otherwise, we'll give out programme leaflets which will feature the synopsis, cast, crew, acknowledgements which will be mass printed in school.    OK, i'm sure i still have lots to tell you, so i'll update this once i remember what they are. (Michelle, wanna update anything I've left out from our informal meeting this morning?)      &nbsp;THRIVE ON! THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!

         Yep. I have decided that I like grey font now.     &nbsp;   Ehhhhh. Refleckshuns.     &nbsp;   Wow everybody is being rather agreeable. I think I will go with the flow.    We need to speed up BSD. I think the rehearsals are going fine, but it's the technical stuff we need to get done.    We definitely need to make a clear stand on what the heck we need to do for exhibition. I am still fairly clueless. I know it's about Western and Eastern culture, but what we put up there, and how we do it is still confusing.     &nbsp;   I think we can follow Wenqi's idea of a trail, with one side Eastern and the other Western. Left and Right. East and West. Compare and Contrast. Something like a museum but definitely with more space for stuff.     &nbsp;   As for experiences, it is rather exciting to do a class play, especially after R&J and CHV. It's different because like what many people pointed out, we are doing this pretty much on our own. Although it might get a little exasperating when we are short of time, I'm sure when the show is over, we will be hugging each other and hopping and crying like maniacs. :)     &nbsp;   Working with the class so far has been pretty good. I haven't gone berserk or started screaming at anybody, so I must say it has been really excellent.     &nbsp;   Pictures! We must take pictures! And make a pretty scrapbook! It could be our class's heirloom!     &nbsp;   Sorry if my points are not very connected. &nbsp;

       Hey people! It's WENQI. Pretty much obvious.    &nbsp;  As far as costumes go, design is coming along pretty well. Although there's supposed to be classification by colour but no one's actually realised that when they're designing. But all that can be fixed later, I guess.    &nbsp;  Exhibition is pretty slow&nbsp;right now&nbsp;but I'm sure it'll pick up. 10 posters in 4 weeks! We're also way below budget at the moment, after calculation we'll only need $65 at most. At least, maybe $45.     &nbsp;  Meetings have been coming along pretty okay. We've decided on our location, time, most of the props needed, and some other stuff like allocation of tasks. The proposal will be coming back soon, and for the non-exhibition people(okay now i feel like an exhibit), watch out for the exhibition!&nbsp;Coming your way 30th August to 3rd September, only in NY canteen. Guaranteed fun and enriching&nbsp;- with free food. Don't say&nbsp;we didn't tell you about it.    &nbsp;  I think&nbsp;those in&nbsp;exhibition have been really easy to work with so far. Everyone's been really spontaneous with suggestions, although sometimes they get slightly far-fetched, and out of point. (Yes, like Peranakan food.) But all in all it's been good, and from what we've got so far progress will be pretty fast once we start on the posters.    &nbsp;  Ms Fong was wrong about the class spirit - it's the same thing everyone was telling 2/13 last year. We really DO have class spirit. Everyone's just too lazy to do anything about it.&nbsp;September the 10th is only 46 days away (trust me, that's not a lot. I speak from experience with CO concert.)    &nbsp;  I'm not going to say we CAN do it, because we WILL do it. =) Rock on, people!

      oh yay. yeah, shao. i agree with you because i think our bsd production has been quite okay so far but we need to speed up a little=) we're doing in house printing for tickets and posters so that should save us some money. so far, i think i've learnt more from this bsd production the chv one because we had professional people to guide us but now we're really on our own=) other than ms ng, of course. so i suppose i'm learning to be independent and benifitting greatly.   the marketing sector has come up with the ticket and poster designs. tickets and one of the posters are by shao *grinx* and the other poster is by carol. i think they're really pretty and since we took a class vote on what posters to use, then i don't think it will be a problem. i hope we can work faster, although we've been pretty on task. we'll be pasting up posters in nine schools, i think. the 7 gep schools plus njc and hwa chong. so that's about all for updates now.

      Hi all!  QiuRong here. I would just like to say that I agree with what ShaoMing and Michelle wrote (seems like we are doing alot of agreeing here...)   Anyway, I think that our preparations for the production have been going on quite well for now, so hopefully if we carry on working hard for the production, it will be a success!  :)

      Yep, I agree with Michelle that it's been great working with everyone so far - (for me) ie the people in publicity, Ms Ng and the people involved in rehearsals. Just in case you're wondering, I don't do much in English rehearsals - so far I just took some pictures and stood in for people who weren't there. For Chinese, it's been great fun (of course, I'm sure we'll also benefit from all this, and not only "have fun") rehearsing "zhen1 xin1" and my line "me1" (?) with Veron and CS ( we  I still can't get it right!) At this point in time, I feel that I have already learnt quite alot from this whole production. I've learnt about how we go about making a production, rehearsals, and about how you  must  listen to others and take in others' advice, to make everything work well (i.e. what Veron and Mich are doing really well). If I may say so, I think this production is bringing our class a little closer together, and making everyone more cooperative, more responsible people (sorry if the sentence looks/sounds weird, I didn't know how to phrase it properly).. :) Jia you, everyone (especially the main cast), in whatever else you have to do for the production! Oh, and also, I must add that the directors (for both Engilsh and Chinese) are  great ! Keep up the good work! :)

      Since our blog is seemingly empty, I'd like to start the ball rolling by posting some reminders:   1) Those who are clueless about bonesetter's daughter production updates, there is a bonesetter's daughter noticeboard at the back of the class. Cast and crew list, as well as meeting minutes will be posted there to keep the whole class abreast of things. So please check regularly.   2) Exhibition people can make use of the noticeboard to post announcements, etc. It is not solely just for the production only.   3) The electives next week will clash with the first 1/2 an hour of&nbsp;our consultation/rehearsal time. or maybe even the whole hour. Please check the noticeboard for rehearsal time updates.   Continue to work hard so that we can pull of a good show and exhibition! Everyone's doing a good job. Try not to worry about the SIA marks, I have great faith that Miss Ng will help us with that as long as we fulfil our responsibilities and keep a record of it.   Working with the class has been a satisfying experience, for me at least, despite all the hiccups and *ahem* a few people who have not been putting much effort into this project. I've learnt to be a better listener (at least I hope so) where the directing of the production is concern, I'm still trying to be as firm and decisive as Veronica ^_^ I'm very thankful for all those who have taken the initiative to make this production work and I hope you guys don't feel any resentment towards this project, and even if you do, we'll still have to stick it through and carry on with it. Just try to enjoy yourself, okay? And remember to post reflections!

       Maybe ure just thinking excessively.. Rehearsals are not really fun ALL the time, they can be quite difficult you know, especially for the directors cos we have to oversee everything and be vigilant always. Actually how do you feel towards acting? I personally think acting is fun cos you can impersonate someone else and walk in the shoes of another person for a little while.. And lose yourself in that character momentraily.. Ain't that good?  Its perfectly fine if you don't enjoy urself to the fullest during rehearsals. Luling is not a cheerful charcter after all.. If you're feeling blue in the midst of acting means part of you has already become luling. That's not a bad thing exactly. Its never easy to get yourself absorbed totally in a charcter. Maybe you'd be wondering. Who am I exactly? But its important to concentrate completely if not your attention will be diverted easily and you can't do your job properly. You need a paradigm shift. Rehearsals are hard work, but once you're 'lost' in them, you'll enjoy them already.  In my previous production I even found rehearsals painful because it felt torturous sometimes to get on with those rehearsals. But on the day itself, everything will seem different and feel different. Once you went past that "hu3 du4 men2" you're luling untill the curtains draw to a close. When the production is over you'll feel glad, probably, but sad as well because you'll find that a feeling of emptiness swallows you. What you will be left with are only memories. Tears, frustrations, scoldings, compliments, hard feelings--- all gone.  -not tezuka.

       Finally got myself an account. Sorry I took so long, but I'm not really used to this... system.       We finished the chinese script quite some time ago, so all I have to do now at present is to finish my Luling role.     what i did     1)Started memorizing my lines about 2 weeks ago... but it doesn't really work unless we try it out together   2)Attended some rehearsals... but we don't seem to be progressing. the most recent rehearsal didn't differ much from those a few weeks back.        reflection    i was quite surprised when i first read the comments and reflections posted by everyone else because they are so positive. why does everyone find the rehearsals fun? i really don't see how. So far, i find myself not sinking into this production, not involving myself. The production is due within a month is it? I don't seem to feel anything.    And the rehearsals... how exactly are we supposed to improve? and is it just me with a problem and that we are actually progressing just that i don't see it? because the english scenes seem to be going very fine, and the chinese ppl find rehearsals fun.        what i have to do    be more involved? haven't figured out how yet, but i suppose the attitude is v. important because apparently mine is all wrong and i have no idea what i am doing.       i don't get it. i really don't get it. how in the world do people look forward to rehearsals and have fun?     i am very lost... happy national day

      Huh. I've never used a blog before. It took me pretty long to figure out how to join. But I've finally added myself! Congratulate me.  This week was tough, what with all the tests one after another. [am going to fail physics] But we did manage to squeeze in a few rehearsals. We did the Ruth/Francine scene, the I-can't-find-my-purse-must-be-gaoling-took-it scene, and the playground scene. We modified the script a little during the rehearsal.  Also, I'm supposed to re-write the last part of the script. The epilogue-thingy, where Young Ruth, Old Ruth, Young LuLing and Old LuLing come out. Suggestions needed! It's a bit messy now, with all the characters taking turns to say lines. Oh, and any suggestions as to how Ruth introduces Art? She goes, " Art’s my live-in boyfriend of ten years. I first met him at a yoga class.  " But that's a little odd, right?  Oh well.  And to Michelle [Wong]: Keep the faith, yo. Great work so far! Speak louder. *grins*

      hello! sorry i haven't posted anything so far...I haven't been doing much these couple of weeks except rehearse the chinese scene 2, which was fun, and discuss a little bit about the western exhibition=$. still, i think everyone's been doing pretty well considering that this week's been chock full of tests and last week was the electives=) jiayou, we don't have much time left! I remember how we rushed for bridging worlds last year, and was thinking that this time round we'll be even busier, but i'm sure it'll be worth it in the end. I apologise for not having contributed too much so far, but I'll put in as much effort as possible from now on try to work on the exhibition and marketing stuff. We're cutting up the tickets and putting up posters for marketing right? I think we need to meet about western exhibition sometime soon as well. Anyway, special thanks to shao, nicole, carol and charmaine for doing a large part of the marketing stuff, and of course to veron michy and CS for basically making all the rehearsals work!

      My turn to post about this week! :)  We (i.e. the part II people) had rehearsal on Thursday, and another recess one... I forgot on which day. Anyway, the Thursday rehearsal was hilarious, as usual, and we had quite a lot of fun, which included laughing and giving each other comments  :) Still, I look forward to rehearsals... maybe because its a good 'de-stressing method', with all that fun...

      okay im like blogging this in sch library now bcos my home comp has practically no internet connection. and well. so i think we finally really really decided on the two poster designs. they are the brown one by shao (with the ribbon thinggie) and the blackish one by carol. our production booklet will be using shao's design for our cover pg. the tickets are being printed on metallic paper by azone. and its ex. its like $4.75 for 20 sheets. so we HAVE to reimburse ms ng k? with roughly 25bux.  the maketing n publicity sector has merged with the accounts ppl. and i've started doing some research for exhibition and we basically completed the content for the production booklet. we need to get down to taking photos and designing though. and currently, the content is being edited by veron n mich c. yeah. thats abt all.

       Lately I've been stressing out over everything because all the nightmarish SIAs are due and there are tests and it seems that I never have enough time. But I always manage to have fun during rehersals, so that is a very good thing.      So far, I have not done anything for Accounts, because nobody has spent anything. I know that Accounts is now under Publicity/Marketing, but I'm still not sure of whether our group is included in all publicity events like letter-writing and poster-pasting because nobody has told us what to do. I do hope we can get the accounts started soon though...       Acting-wise, I'm still trying to memorise my lines. I did think I had them memorised until I tried to say them without the script and said "ru guo wo men zhen de you yuan..." instead of "ru guo ni men zhen de you yuan...". Which is a  very  big mistake. I am beginning to hate that line. Argh. I can't say it at the right speed, without sounding too pleased that Kaijing is dead.           I also said lines at the wrong times. -___- So yeah. More work needed. (I just don't feel confident without the script!) Maybe we should rehearse more often, with all the characters present. Or maybe run through all the scenes at once. We haven't rehearsed with the props either. *screams* I can't believe we only have one month left.

      Okay, since Ms Ng says that we're to update every week, here's my post this week. (:  Today, I sent Ms Ng the final copy of the ticket design so that she can print it.. I made this pretty stupid mistake of putting "nygh auditorium" instead of "siew may auditorium".. But this doesn't beat a previous mistake when I put the wrong timing on the poster >  About cutting up the tickets, I think anyone and everyone who's free in 'publicity' group should help. So far I think we've got Nicole, Charmaine, Ren Yi and I.. but shouldn't a few more be better? =P Or would too many people be useless? I don't know, I have to ask Nicole/Ms Ng/Charmaine first.   As for the publicity letter, I'll be getting the addresses of the schools from the school websites/moe website, type it in and try and print it out by Wednesday. But I'd have to ask Ms Ng when we're going to the different schools so that I can type it in, unless we'll write it in later (in which case, would we be writing in the addresses too?)  I think that's about it.. I'll update again when I get something else done! ^^ Oh, and I'll go for the next rehearsal (Thursday, right?) to take pictures (if I can borrow the camera from Ms Ng)! Also, keep up the good work, everyone!!
