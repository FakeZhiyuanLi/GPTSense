      You might think I'm crazy, because I just saw a movie, and now I'm freaking out about it, but I don't care! The Day After Tomorrow could happen! Whether we like it or not. It's very unlikely yes, but it could! Shut up! I know I'm crazy! But! We need to conserve energy. Especially things that pollute because that's just nasty. So, don't by SUVs people! By the Toyota Preus that is sitting on the lot just waiting to be used. Just think too! If you have an hybrid, less gas money! It's crazy, saving money and your lungs at the same time! I know it sounds impossible but its not! Also turn the stupid light off when you leave a room, and shut the water off when you aren't using it. It's just that easy people, it's just that easy. Me and Aimee went and saw this movie tonight, and I think everyone should. Because they need see what they are doing to this world. So conserve energy! Alright, I am officially the biggest loser in the world. But who cares! We need to say the world!

      If you see a veteran today. Say thanks for all that they have done. Since it's Memorial Day and all. You should all be thankful. So if you see one. Tell them thanks. Alright now back to my day. Yesterday, since I didn't write, I got up and got ready and drove over to my cousins house. We had a party for Matt and Annie because it was there birthday this week. And then me and Michael were staying over at Matt's for the night. We could of went swimming, because they have a heated inground pool which is hott, but we decided not to. We decided to bug our aunts and uncles till one of them took us driving. Which finally Danny did. I was the best driver because I'm just that hott. Michael you ran the stop sign. Matt was actually okay for a 14 year old. And then we rode the Gator, which is the coolest little truck thing in the world. And then I freaked out Michael by acting like I was on something. It was pretty funny, I actually made it really believeable. Then we talked online and went to bed. We got up, and Michael had to leave to go play in the band, so me and Matt just rode the Gator around and then he took me home. Now I'm there and my uncle and cousins are over on my dad side to have a cook out thing. I still need to take a shower though. I read some of the comments and they keep coming in. I still don't see why people come here if they don't like me. Oh and Mercer, I knew it was you who wrote it. CJ told me, well not me but he can't keep his mouth shut. And I found it hilarious how you still called me 5 times, and even asked me to your birthday party. But I was a nice guy and wasn't mean even though I knew you said all that. And I do kinda feel bad that I accused CJ and Tejas when it was you. But thats how life goes. Now, like I said. If you don't like it here. Leave. You are hurting people that shouldn't even be hurt. I'm not saying I'm not either, but this whole this is over now. No more about it, or it will be deleted. Because I'm almighty like that. Well I need to go take a shower! Happy Memorial Day everyone! And don't forget to say thanks to a verteran! Later.

      Well, now that I just got done typing that huge thing about the comment fight. Back to my day. Today was actually very short. I didn't do much. I got up, took my shower and just sat around a little. Then my dad asked me if I wanted to go fishing so I said yeah. So me, him, and my brother went out to Eureka Lake and fished. Now, the fish there are stupid. We never got one bite. A huge lake. Not one bite. And we asked 3 other people. And they said they got the same thing. No bites. How stupid! Stupid fish. So we got done and drove home. Then I said good bye to Andrew and Brian because they left for South Carolina today. They get to go south while I'm stuck in this stupid state. It's gonna be borning without them though. At least they are only going for a week. Then I went to church, and came home and ate. And just sat at home. I was gonna go bowling with Aimee but my parents went to the movies with my brother. And they just got home. And I have to get up early tomorrow. So paying 11 bucks to go bowling for about an hour and a half doesn't seem good money wise. I'm sorry Aimee! We'll have to go get some baked rigatoni at the Brick Oven when I get back on Monday night! And then we can have a cookie desert too! Yummmy! But then, because of my parents being gone. I sat at home and am still sitting at home. I have to get up early tomorrow so I'm gonna go to bed early tonight. For I'm not dead tomorrow. Later.

      Well, I didn't think I would have to address this, I actually never thought it would get this stupid. But here goes I guess. I've been called many hilarious things which I laugh at. Some including a racist, a fascist, a nazi, a fake, and that's just in one post. I don't care what people call me so those things don't bother me. I'll defend myself though. Racist, no I'm not racist. Do I have many friends that arn't white? Nope. But there arn't that many people of other ethnic backgrounds in our town. That's just the way it goes. And yes, I did tell Tejas to go back to India. Was it out of racism? No. I would tell a white British person to go back to England if they are just over here to steal from our countries wealth or brag about what they are getting from our country, which I have heard from Tejas. And plus, I never labled Tejas as an Indian. He did, that's his main saying, "I'm Indian." He was born in Winsconsin. So that makes him just as American as me yes. But he said he was Indian, so I told him to go back to India. Makes sence doesn't it? Do I believe in fascism? Nope not on a government standpoint. Can I be a fascist about this website and say who can come here and who can talk here. Heck yes. This is my website. I can dictate it however I want. Am I making you come to this website like a Nazi could? Nope, actually you never have to come to this website. And like I said, if you don't like it here, leave. You don't have to stay. I'm not forcing you like a Nazi would. I actually asked CJ to leave. Did he? Nope. Because he believes it's fun to make fun of me, which is very immature. But I guess its his right. But I never started any of this. I would of never commented on any of you people if you guys never would of came here first. I never stated anything offensive to any of you until CJ decided to come and leave a comment like "or just die." And then all these other people started leaving them. So what did I do? I left one too on my own site. Do you have a problem with that? I never bug you guys. I never IM you. You guys IM me, decide to put stuff on my site, I don't do that to you. So get over yourselves. I never bugged you. You just judged me. Nick you have no clue who I am. I don't know you. So I don't know why you are commeting at all. Isn't that just a little judgemental? Which you are accusing me of being? As I said to CJ last night, I don't talk about any of you guys, do anything to you guys, or hurt any of you guys. CJ just told me I was ignorant and everything I did was wrong. That could be true! But just ignore me then. I don't go around saying any of you guys are wrong. You guys come to me because you think its fun. If you guys come and do that to me, I'm gonna respond. It's ovious. And don't threaten my friends or me. Because that's the most immature thing I have ever seen. Like I said, if you don't like me, great. Just leave me and my friends alone. It's simple and smart right? Wow, I guess you learn something new every day. Well like I said, I can't believe this even got this far. I'm sorry if I affended anyone. But like I said, if you don't like what you see here. Use the little X at the top right of the screen. And then everything will be alright for you! And as for you people who say this is retarded for me to post my life here. Awesome! I hope it is! Because, man those other millions of people out there who use these blog sites must be retarded to! Well now that this is all over with, I'm gonna go get some food.

      I thought it would never come. But it's finally here. Summer. I got up today at 7:00 and went to go take my last final. Which I got a C+ on but thats besides the fact because I got an 97 in the class. But then I found out I got an A in English. That made my day, only like 5 people get A's in her class. And I was one biotch! After school I had to clean out my lockers and then I got yelled at for talking on my cell phone on the side walk. I was like "hey! if they can give condoms out on the side walk, I can talk on my stupid cell phone." Well he wasn't to happy so I stepped onto the road. Then my mom came and I went home and got online and was bored. And very hungry. So me and Kyle decided to go somewhere. We decided to ride to Nancy's over near Krogers. So we took the back bike path which is really cool. But there was this freaky guy who like wanted to rape us. Luckily we weren't raped. We ate and then went to Kmart, Krogers, and finally the great Walmart. Then we road around and then went backed to Kyle's house where I almost beat Kyle in pool. But then I rode home and just got back online for a little. Then I went and picked Kayla up and we went to Codi's and Brie's going away party. Which was interesting... The cops came which is always fun. Andrew and Brian are leaving for South Carolina tomorrow. So yeah, like the next week is going to suck and be borning. But I'll find ways to occupy myself. Oh! If you want to see a cool converstation and how cool some people are, look at the comments on the post before this. I just don't see why if someone hates you, they don't leave you alone. It makes no sense to me. But I guess it doesn't have to. I just stay away from them, but they come to me. I just must be that cool. Tom Green is on Jay Leno. He is a great man. Later!

      Today I had three more finals. English, band, and PE. I have to get a 89 or higher on my English final to get an A in the class. So I took the whole hour. So all you people who finished early and wanted to talk. Too bad for you. Then I had band which was just playing and talking the whole time, no real final. And then PE we finished our PE test which is totally gay anyways in about 15 minutes because we cheated. Easy as that. But then the like hour and 20 minutes in there was horribly long. I thought it was never going to end. But it did, and then me, brian, and andrew walked home. We went to Brian's house and dropped off his stuff, then went to Andrews and I guess he couldn't come out to eat with us... so we walked to my house to go get my bike. But on the way there the wonderful Haley was driving with her sister and they picked us up and we went to Monicals with her and Jenny and millions of other girls. It was awesome. Then after that, my sister came and picked me, Brian, and Haley up and we went back to her house and played the best game ever. Dance Dance Revolution. I mean you can't beat that game, its imposible. Even when you cheat like we did. People who do that are crazy... and I mean really crazy. So we stayed there for awhile, and then left. Then I went over to Brimfield and watched my cousin Matt graduate from 8th grade. Then we went out to his house and he lives on a farm in the middle of nowhere. It was beautiful. I just sat in the middle of the road, because there was no cars ever! I could sleep out there in the middle of the road. Its that dead! I loved it! It would be so awesome to live out there. But then it got really weird on the way home. First, we hit traffic. I mean come on! Who in the heck has traffic at 10:00 at night!? Well I guess East Peoria and Peoria does on I74. Who ever made that genious idea up, screw you. So there was traffic and we were in it for about 10 minutes and then we took an exit through East Peoria. We were going and my mom totally like lost it, she had no clue where she was going. She was pulling into Steak 'N Shake and I'm like, "Mom what are you doing?" and she goes "Oh what am I doing!? I was suppose to go left!" I'm like wow... So we finally get going the right way. And then we were at a red light right, and there is this guy in another car right. Well he was starring at me! I'm like what is this guy doing!? And then he nods at me! Well this guy was a guy that looked like he was gonna rape me. So I go "Mom this guy is scaring me" and she is like do you know him? And I'm like, No. She is like "Oh look! Green!" and she slams the gas. I felt like the guy was following us. But he wasn't, or so I think. If I die tonight, you know who did it a guy in a silver Lexus! But we finally got home and it's like 10:39 right now. Hmmm, I don't want to go to bed, but I have another final tomorrow. Should I? Well, I'll stay up to 11:00. Tomorrow is the last day of school. Only till 9:55... I'm sorry if I'm wrong about that Ryn. I believe it's 9:55, hopefully? Oh well, time to listen to some music. Or eat something. Food is good too. Music or Food? Who knows. Nite.

      Ahh, I got to sleep in today. I didn't have to be to school until 8:15 which is really nice. But my dog was barking for 10 minutes before like 15 minutes before I had to get up. And my stupid brother wouldn't stop her from barking. So I had to get my cell phone, becuase I was just way to lazy to get out of bed, and call my house to yell at my brother. So finally they got her to stop barking. Then I got up and took my final. I got a 93 on my Algerbra one. He has a freaking huge curve! Which is the coolest thing ever! Because I would of done horrible without that godly curve. Then in speech we ate brownies and food! That was a great final. Then in Spanish we had a great final. It was 100 mulitple choice off a website! I love you Mr. Blair! Then I got out and came home. And then listend to music. Oh yeah people I'm the Captain! I have whole topics dedicated to me ->  urlLink link

      Today was the last day of full school. Thank god. I loved it. No more 0 hour for awhile. I took a no dress and went to study hall. Wow wierd people in study hall. Really wierd. I found out the only final I really have to study for is English. And I have to study my butt off to keep an A. But after school I walked home and then KLT came over and we studied math. Well really didn't study because we didn't get anything done. Her cookies were good though. Then I just got online. That was my day! Finals are gonna suck! But hopefully i'm good at it. Well sleep time. Later

      Yep... you heard it right. I made another journal. This time who knows if i'm going to keep it. Or if I even show it to people. If I do show it to people, get over yourselves. If you don't like something I post, use the little X at the top right corner of the screen. And then all problems solved. Amazing right? If you have something to say though, you can comment on a post at the bottom. That would be cool if you did. Well, I have had a crappy day. The only good part of my day was the free chips I got in 0 hour. But the rest sucked. People suck or I suck either one. Who knows. I just feel lonely, I guess there is nothing I can do. I feel like every friend I have met this year is gone. I don't think I feel it, I think I know that they are gone. I tried to get one back, but I totally screwed that up. Oh well I must be annoying or something. I think I'm getting a cold or something. I don't feel to well. I have a whole bunch of homework to do and it's not gonna get down. Oh well only a week left right? Who needs finals? Then just two weeks off and then school again. Then camps all the way back to stupid school. This sucks... I'm not looking forward to anything. I'm gonna go listen to music. Maybe some Starting Line will cheer me up. Later.

      Well I haven't wrote for like three or four days so I'll write right now. Well hmm what did I do on Sunday. I really don't remember. I got up oviously, oh and then went out to breakfast at the cracker barrel and got my normal, the all you can eat biscuts and gravy, but i never eat the gravy i just put butter and jelly on the biscuts and eat about 9 biscuts. But after that what did I do? I really can't remember at all. Oh I think I did a whole lot of nothing! I sat at home and did nothing, I believe, but maybe I didn't. This is hard I shouldn't wait this long to write. Sunday is totally lost in my mind. If you remember what I did, which I would feel really sad about myself if you did, post it in a comment. Wait! I came home after breakfast and did nothing. And then Andrew and Amanda and Whiteny walked over like at 3:00, and we walked to Andrew's for a little, and then he had to do something, so we left and went to Whitney's and played basketball. I had to leave around 3:30 though because I was going to a movie with KLT and Haley. They were picking me up at 3:50. So they came and picked me up, and we got to the movie theater and we saw someone who made us laugh. It was Jeff Zuckerman. Well if any of you know Zuckerman you know that he is just... yeah, Zuckerman. But we saw him and then, we went to see the Notebook. Very good movie. For a love story and from a guys point of view, great story and great movie. The actors were awesome, the guy was a phenomial actor, and the girl, who was the same person from mean girls, was also very good and very pretty. I didn't cry but I hear alot of guys cry at the end of the movie, KLT was crying at so many points. But I when that movie comes out on DVD I'm gonna buy it. It's just very good, go see it. But then after that, I got home. And then after that I went over and visited Amanda at her house. Then after that, I came home and did I don't know, on to Monday. I got up, went to school, and then came home. My dad left for a buisness trip at like 6 in the morning, and then my mom got called in. So after all that I had to wait for my mom to get home. And then I rode up to Walmart and then stoped at Kyles for awhile and visited him because he can't get out much anymore. Then around 5:00 I went home and then I think I went and visited Amanda again, and then I had to go. And then her, Natlie, and Whitney walked over to my house and we talked for awhlie. And then I went inside and started my homework. Wait, in between that I went to Haley's really quickly and we did something for a friend. Then after all that I started on my homework, and then talked to KLT on the phone till around 11:45, and then finally went to bed. Then I got up today, went to school oviously, and had an easy day in school. On our break there was this cracker with ants all over it. It was really nasty, their was so many of them. Someone started to block there pathway though lol, it was cool. But school was really easy, and then after that, I was giving Kyle a ride home and my mom said Mrs. Riedel called and I could have a computer from St. Pat's that they didn't need anymore. So me and Kyle went there and we got the computer. Thank you Mrs. Riedel! I got to see Mrs. Campbell again to which was really cool, she was my 6th grade teacher and by far my favorite at St. Pats. But I got my computer, and then went and took Kyle home. Then I set up my computer and then went to Brimfield with my mom and sister. We went to my cousins to go swimming and pick up my brother because he spent the night there. Well I rode the gator for a long time and went a lot of places. And finished one of my goals. And then I went swimming, and then rode the gator again. And then we had to leave around 3:30. But it was nice to spend the afternoon out there. They have a heated in ground pool and they live out in the middle of the country. I love it, it's so peaceful, surrounded by cornfields, I loved it. The weather was awesome a nice breeze and around 80. Oh, I want to live there. But then we left and I had a metting for Student Council, we picked our shirts, thankfully Mike picked the good one. Sorry to all you girls out there that liked the camo, it was nasty. And Mr. Sanders is leaving! He took a job in Morton! He was the coolest teacher/advisor ever. He let us do almost whatever we wanted and he treated us like we were equal to him and like we were his friends. It was very nice, it makes you get past the teacher thing and actually lets you get to know the person. So I'll miss you Mr. Sanders! But then after that, I came home and then watched a little Summerland, and then Amanda called and told me to go up to the soccerfields. So I went and her, my buddy Andrew, Amy, Kacy, and Natelie, and Brian but only for a little. We stayed and talked for a long time, and then Angela Gotchal came, along with some of her friends and two kids from Metamora. Well one of the kids was my age, and they were buff and could kick my butt any day. Even the one who was a year younger than me. So I was just a little intimdated. But they were cool, and we all talked for awhlie. But one got out of his consitution test because he told the wresling coach he was going to be in wresling, so the coach just gave him an A without him taking it. Only in Metamora can that happen, sports over everything, especially football you little steroid driven punks! Wait to harsh, those two kids were cool, so they don't take steroids but everyone else from Metamora does! Evil little metamorons! Oh well back to my day, after that we all had to go home, so I rode Amanda home and then I came home and it's taken like 45 minutes to write this. I'm very off task. I have my US Consitution test tomorrow for APS becuase you have to take it in high school again, isn't 8th grade enough? But I'm not gonna study because it should be easy, they have to make it so people who arn't educated pass it. So why study, if I fail its my fault. Oh well. I'm really tired though, and I have to much stuff to do. Tomororw I have to mow the lawn, I almost did it tonight at 9:45, I was tempted, but the grass was wet. So oviously that doesn't work. But oh well. So remind me to mow the grass. Well I'm tired and this is long enough. So good night!

      Well as most of you know, this morning or late night in our time zone, the power to govern Iraq was passed from the United States to the new Iraqi government. This happend two days ahead of schedual, as it was suppose to be done on June 30th. But because of gorilla's with thier recent insurgences and promised insurgences to stop the handover of power on June 30th, the US in secret handed over power today. After our year and a half "war" with the stupid country thank god it's over. Now, don't get me wrong, I am paterotic and all, but going to war with Saddam Hussein was the stupidest descion ever. Well, I guess that's what we get when we have a President in office the country did not want. Yeah, that's right, the country did not want Bush as a president. And we are losing our countries money, supplies, and most importantly our military over his stupid little greediness to finish the job his dad started as President. We have pictures of us Americans, and other nationalitys being beheaded over in Iraq and other Arab countries because of this war. Car bombs are a daily occurance, sometimes an hourly occurance, and again most are because of our presence in the Arab countries. Now Saddam Hussein was not a nice man at all, he did some horrible things. But so have other people. Castro in Cuba isn't the nicest man, and you don't see us going after him. Everything Bush backed his war up on was proven wrong. We didn't find any chemical weapons and Hussein did not help with 9/11. So what was the reason we went after him? Well Bush was greedy and wanted oil, and again to finish his dad's job. So he sent our military over there, one was my good friends dad, who had to leave while his wife was pregnat, so he couldn't help there, and missed everything of my friends 8th grade year, from may crowning, to graduation all because he was sent over to some country to help with the war. He wasn't even in Iraq. But then there are the thousands that lost their life. And all to get to this day. The Iraq people are now in charge, but did you know, that over half the American population think Iraq will be another dictaorship in less than 5 years? What are all the families who lost thier love ones going to think in 5 years when they know the war was pointless? It's going to be horrible for them. Iraq is in a horrible state right now as proven because they had to move the handover up insecret just becuase of it. We can't force our government upon someone else. The people they interview on the news who say they love americans are a very little minority over there. The news is bias. Any intelligant person should know that. But most people don't want anything American, including democracy. They want us away from them and as far as away as possible. So really today marked a day that should of never happened. And we'll all soon see that. How stupid our President was. The President we didn't want. The President that screwed us over.

      I didn't write yesterday just because it was late and I was tired and I didn't feel like sitting on the computer writing it all out. So I'll combine yesterday and today's posts all into one compact one. Well yesterday, I got up, and then went to school. I already wrote about my test in a post before this, I think. Sorry if I didn't it, but I'm not writing it again, just because I'm lazy, sorry. Well after my test I came home and really did nothing. I really didn't do anything to later on that day. But around 7:00 I went over to Splashdown, because my ortho, Dr. Arkwell, rented it out. Well it's only been like 68 degrees out lately. And this is in late June. How stupid is that, it's summer and its not even hot. So I didn't swim, I just got the free food they give out. I got some nachos and a powerade. Then I was in the car and Brian and Melissa called and asked if I wanted to watch 50 First Dates with them. So they came over and we stuck it in and we watched it. I had already seen it before, but it was still a good movie. I really like Adam Sandler, he is really funny. So we watched it and then hung out after and then they left. Then I just got online and really did nothing. Then I went to bed and got up today. Me and my parents got into a fight which really put a damper on my day. I asked to do something about three months ago. And they said no. But then about 2 days ago my sister and asked they had no problem with it. So wow was there yelling. Hopefully I get to go with my sister though. But then after all that I really had nothing to do. At around 1:00 my nieghboors who moved here from Massachusetts. They brought like 17 live lobsters back, and like Clams, and all this. And made fresh new England Chowder. Well, I'm not really into seafood. I like crab legs and thats about it. And then there were no kids there under 23. So, yeah. I didn't stay long. I went home and just sat and did nothing. I have been really bored lately, me and Kyle can't ride are bike to K-Mart anymore which is making me sad. He just needs a new leg right now! Right now! Well since he isn't in shape to ride, I have turned to my alternate material. MTV's the Real World. Now I'm not really the person who watches that much MTV, let alone TV. But The Real World is really growing on me. I know some of the people are there that just want to get a start in Hollywood. But then some are actually living it out for real. And it is unscripted which is cool, so its random. But I have been watching the marathon of the San Diego one, and I have been watching it for about 2 and a half hours. I just can't stop. Well I can and I did for a little because I went outside and played basketball with my brother for about a half an hour. But I have been watching a lot of The Real World. I also was downloading an album and the stupid leechers on bittorent screwed me over. I was on 99.65% and it stopped. And there were no more seeds for over 6 hours. I had uploaded over 300MB to other people in seeds, but no seeds out of 114 people for my album. So after I let it kill my connection for about 6 hours I just said screw it and canceled it. But I was mad. Stupid 99.65%! Well back to the Real World! Later!

      Let's talk this over, it's not like we're dead. Was it something I did? Was it something you said? Don't leave me hanging, in a city so dead. Held up so high, on such a breakable thread. You were all the things I thought I knew. And I thought we could be. You were everything, everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... You've got your dumb friends. I know what they say. They tell you I'm difficult, but so are they. But they don't know me. Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me. All the shit that you do. You were all the things I thought I knew, and I thought we could be. You were everything, everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... It's nice to know you were there. Thanks for acting like you cared. And making me feel like I was the only one. It's nice to know we had it all. Thanks for watching as I fall. And letting me know we were done. You were everything, everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh... You were everything, everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away. All this time you were pretending. So much for my happy ending. Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...  So much for my happy ending...

      Alright since my sister got out of this while I was writing it last night. I'll rewrite it. Alrighty. I got up yesterday and had school like normal. I wasn't really tired, I don't know why, I got a little more sleep than normal so that was probably the reason. I went to APS and it was an okay day. We reviewed a little, took notes. And then we watched this really cool movie called FEED. It was a documentary about like presidental canididates when they were getting ready to just go on TV, but the cameras were already running just in case they got the server feed early or late. So it was pretty funny to see what they do when no one was watching. It was pretty cool. Then I was done with APS and I went home. I made myself some breakfast and just kinda hung out. Then my mom came home and she asked if we wanted Little Ceasers Pizza. Oh, you can not beat Little Ceasers. Five freaking bucks for a large pizza!! That is so awesome! And their pizza is very very good. You can get like 3 of them for the price of one at pizza hut. And Little Ceasers are so much better. Oh I was in heaven when she brought home that half cheese half pepporoni pizza and then cheasy crazy bread. Oh, I want some right now. I love that stuff so much! But then I ate. And then I watched the Newlyweds on MTV. Well, Jessica Simpson is hott. So, yeah I watched that for awhile. But she is kinda really stupid. They were talking about a double in baseball, and they had no clue what it was. They thought about it, and finally shot down the right answer and went with a new one. But it's perfectly okay because she is hot and really rich. But while I was watching that KLT called and asked if I wanted to go to Hollands with her, Natilie, Haley, and Kayla. So I went up there and me, KLT, and Natilie waited awhile for Kayla and Haley to come. They came and then we stayed there for awhile and then we walked back to KLT's house and me and Natilie both had to go. So we rode home. Once I got home, I ate dinner, but I forgot what we had. Oh well. But then Andrew asked if I wanted to go over to his house. So I went, and then Andrew drove us to Wild Bills. Andrew got his permit. Be afraid. lol actually no. He is an awesome driver. He did nothing wrong when I was there. And then we go this really good strawberry sundae at Wild Bills and then Andrew drove us home. Then we got online for a little and then asked Amanda and a lot of other people if they wanted to go play soccer again. So Brian came over, and then we walked to the field where we went Natilie and then Amanda and Amy came. And then we started to play, and then Chris Whitmer came and then we played more. Well, I suck at soccer, and most of the girls did to. So we got killed. But then we just ended up talking on the ground like we usally do. And then at 9:00, me and Natilie both had to go home, so we walked together, and then I went to Andrew's and got my bike. And then I saw Brian and Andrew and Chris walking together and then I talked to them for a little. And then rode home. I hadn't even started on my APS. I had a test today, and last night I didn't study till 10:30. Opps, and I only studied for about 15 minutes. Hopefully it pulls out. I'll find out on Monday I guess lol. And then my dog kept barking so I held her for a little to get her to stop. And then I finally got in bed. Then I woke up this morning, and went to school. I had my test that I just said I hardly studied for. I wrote four pages worth of stuff. I'm always really close to that time limit though. I'm scared that one day I won't make it. But my hand killed after we did that. After that, we got a 10 minute break and we went outside like normal, but then it was to cold so we came back inside and just talked. Then we went back to the room, and got assigned departments of the cabinant. We had to find information on it. Tara was my partner and we got the Treasury departmant. So he took us up to the computer lab, where hardly any of the computers worked. They all sucked, and were all broken. So me and Tara finally found one that kinda worked so we used it, and found our information really quickly and then had nothing else to do. So we just played games and just talked. My computer didn't have a mouse so I had to use the computer the whole time. It was horrible. But I did it! And then finally he let us out about 5 minutes early, and then I gave Ryn a ride home, and this is where I am now. Oh wait! This morning, when I was brushing my teeth. I broke a freaking bracet! I have never broken one in the whole year and a half I have had these braces. I have ate so many things I'm not suppose to, and it never broke. But when I freaking brush my teeth, all of a sudden I feel a pop, and then it comes out. It was really stupid, especially when I just had an ortho appointment two freaking days ago! I was not happy because now I have to go again. Oh well I guess. I have nothing to do today. So if you want to do something. That would be awesome because I'll be bored if noone wants to. Well food time! Hopefully I covered everything that was in my last post. If not, oh well I'm hungry! Later!

      Well I just had a huge post all typed out and my sister decided she had to put up her buddy list. And she messed up and hit my exit on accident. So I'm tired and I don't feel like writing it all over again tonight. So I'll just write it tomorrow. It was a good post too :-(. Oh well, the title was "watch out!" because Andrew got his permit today. That crazy boy. He is an awesome driver though. I got to ride with him! :-). Well I'll right more about it after summer school tomorrow. I have a test sadly.

      Well today was another wonderful day of school. I liked it again though. Today was hilarious. We made laws again, and lots of funny things were said. Like Mr. Reem's six-year-old daughter and birth control lol. And how Roxanne predicted what was going to be said. It was just an awesome day. And I got the most bills pasted! So I was happy. Then we took notes because we have a test on Friday. And then that was all we had to do. We got to leave after that. Then me, Bree, and today Ryn were gonna walk home again. But then the awesome Tara took us home again. She told us to get in her car and there was no exceptions. So we did, she is an awesome driver. It's always fun riding with her. Then I got home and did nothing for a little. And then I cooked myself two grilled cheeses for lunch. After that, I just kinda hung out. I went outside for a little. And just listend to music on the computer for most of the time. Then my dad got home and he mowed the lawn. And then Amanda came over with her dog which has the coolest name in the world. We talked, and then I had to go becaues my daddy was taking me out to eat. We went to Mcdonalds and I got two double cheeseburgers becasue we had coupons! My dad got to Big Mac's because he also had a buy one get one free coupon too! I love coupons! I could live off them, getting things for cheap or free is awesome! Like my two pair of jeans that I got at Old Navy one day for nine bucks each. Yeah they are a little bigger in the waist, but hey they work! You have to love Old Navy. But back to my day. I got home and ate with my dad, and then I just went and got on the computer and Andrew asked me if I wanted to go to the park with him, and he told me to invite Amanda, Natalie, and Whitney. So I did :-D. Whitney was in St. Louis so Amanda and Natalie walked to my house, and then we went to the park and met Andrew there. We played there for a long time, me and Andrew swung on the swings and I almost hit the tree, three times! It was scary, but fun too. And then Brian came with CJ. And then we decided to go play soccer at the soccer fields. Well we had to get the girls shoes so we went to Natalie's house and Amanda just used a pair of her shoes. Then we went back to the park, and then Amanda forgot her cell at Natalie's house so she ran and got it and then we went to the Soccerfields. And then Brian and Andrew killed us in soccer. They even let us have 5 free points! That's how horrible we are! But it was extremely fun. Then Andrew kicked the ball and it totally hit me in the back of the head. He didn't do it on purpose, but it hurt lol. But I still love you buddy! Don't worry! Then we played "smear the queer" which kinda worked out but Andrew was just way to fast for any of us to catch him. And then we just ended up on the soccerfields sitting and talking. And then we all decided it was time for us to go home, so I walked Amanda home, and then I walked home and drank about a half of a picher of koolaid. I was so thirsty and how can you not like koolaid!? They have a mascot that is a huge picher! How awesome is that!? And he busts in to peoples houses!! I always wonder if stuff falls into his huge hole on the top, and then that would just be nasty koolaid! But that's besides the point. And then I just came downstairs and did my APS. And then there was  urlLink this . Wow this kid is crazy, he has way more muscle then I do! Just think when he goes through puebrty! He is going to be one buff kid! I'm jealous of him! I have no muscle at all. Which makes me sad. But I'm just way to lazy to get any. Oh well. Well I told myself I was going to bed by 10:00, and that's oviously not happening. I'm talking to KLT on the phone which usually takes a long time. I'll just think about how I still love Mary-Kate Olsen evne thuogh she is in rehab for anorexia. I still love you Mary-Kate! Tell Ashely I miss her! Wow I'm to obsessed with them. I just need to stop right now!! Well I need sleep really really bad. So I'll talk to you later! Night!

      I got up today, and I was like when you feel like you arn't tired but the only reason you know you arn't tired is because you didn't get hardly any sleep at all. Well I felt like that. The night before I found out my brother sleep talked. He went "What!? What!?" and it kinda freaked me out lol. Then I don't know if this was a dream or not, but I thought he got out of bed, went somewhere, and then came back and touched my bed and me to see if someone was there, then he just got back in bed. I don't know if he was sleep walking, or I was dreaming. I don't know. It was wierd. But then I woke up and I didn't feel tired, but like out of it, but not tired! I went to school, and we did something awesome in APS. I loved it. We got to play some polotics. I was republican as you should know if you actually read my journal. If you don't, well that's your problem! But, we got to vote and pass laws. And we had the majority, so we killed almost all of the democrats laws, and debated about them. You would think this was borning as most people do, but I live for this stuff. I love it, I know I'm a loser, but I'm a cool loser! :-D But that was awesome in APS. Then Tara Adams gave me and Bree a ride home, so thank you for that Tara! Then, I got home and cooked myself french toast, and an omlet. It was good, my sister asked me if I wanted to go over to Peoria with her, but I said I would just stay home alone. So I did, and did nothing for a long long time. For dinner I made myself another omlet which was better than the one before. It was good. Then, I just did nothing again. But then at 8:00, the wonderful, specatcular, awesome, hotty, Brian came over. And we talked and I attempted to ride his skate board but it didn't work. And then the wonderful Amanda called me and told me to go to the park with Brian. So we went, and her and the awesome Natilie was there. And then the cool person Whitney came. And yes I am using adjectives just because I'm bored writing this and it makes me laugh. But we talked, and played in the sand, and talked more, and then Brian left, and then we played in the sand more. And then we thought people were spying on us. Well we thought it was people who particular don't like me, but it turned out to me random wierd people when we caught them. I think one sophmore, and a few younger freshman. It was wierd. But then, we decided we would walk to my lover Andrew's house. We stayed and talked to him for awhile, because he is just that cool. And then me and Natelie called it a night and walked home, while Amanda and Whitney sayed with Andrew to talk. Well this is where I am now. I hated walking home in the dark alone, it always freaks me out. But I saw a humgo, yes humgo, plain. It was big. And it was flying really really low. It was wierd, but at this time I was running home because I thought someone was chasing me, which I usually do feel like when I'm walking home in the dark alone. That would be freaky if someone was actually chasing me. Ah that sends shivers down my spine. Well I'm gonna call it a night early tonight; because I need to get some sleep for I'm not dead for school. Have a great night!

      Well today, I had to get up and go to wonderful summer school. Getting up at 6:30 is really tough, especially when you go to bed at 12:00 every night. But what can you do? We took notes for half of the time today, and then we got to go into "committees" and pass bills and revise them and kill them. It was actually pretty fun. Jenny, she is harsh in that lol. She stole my papers and stuffed them in her pocket because I had many many bills passed that I wrote myself. She wasn't a happy camper. Nananana! I beat you! Oh is it fun to act like a third grader again. After school, I gave Ryn a ride home, and then came home for a little. And then my mom asked if I wanted to go to Chili's with her, my sister, and her boyfriend, Jason. So I went, and it was pouring down rain. Like a huge downpour. It was pretty cool, I love to watch rain. It's very interesting. I know I'm a loser so shut up. We got chips and salsa and then I got backed potato soup. Which was really good. Then we came home, in the lots and lots of rain. And then my sister and Jason went back to St. Louis. So I said goodbye to them, and really after that I did nothing at all today. I just sat around. I ate dinner, and then just sat aorund again. It was raining so I couldn't go outside. I finally got to go out tonight, and it was all foggy. Wow it was erie but really cool. It's like one of those nights that you sneak out and go have a sayons (spelling? even though I have a spell checker on this, I'm just way to lazy) in the graveyard at 12:00. Like on Now and Then! Great movie, thankfully someone else knows that movie besides me. And that girl is the coolest in the world, Amanda! But that would be so cool to go out there so late at night, and with it all foggy. Wow I want to do it. But it was to wet to stay outside for a long time, so I came back in and desided to do my APS even though it's not due till Wendsday. Well I got it all done thankfully meaning I have no homework tomorrow night, hopefully that is. I can watch Summerland with out having to worry about homework. Whitney just told me this story I kinda understood lol. I guess I would of had to of been there. Something about a kid they thought it looked like me, but then it was to big to be me lol. Well in Amy's mind she thought it was me lol. And Amanda is sad tonight! So she went to bed to try to get happy, hopefully she does! Or I'll have to tell her a lame joke for she might laugh at that! Hopefully that is lol. And I just found out Whitney has feelings for food. Maybe that will make Amanda happy because that's hilarious lol. Brian just got online to wait for his mom to get out of the bathroom, he has to go to camp tomorrow. We are both going to be dead tomorrow. Oh well! Well I really really need sleep. Night!

      Well, I got up today and had to wait for both my sisters to take their showers to take mine. But once they went to 11:00 Mass I got in and took mine. Then right when I got out KLT called me and I was getting ready then the awesome Brian came over. And I gave him his CD, but then I had to eat, so I ate. My sister's boyfriend Jason is staying with us for the time him and my sister are here. He is a really cool guy, he is sleeping in my room while I have to sleep in my brothers with him in his other bed. But Jason is really cool, after we ate, me, my dad, my brother, and Jason went golfing together. I haven't been golfing forever and I totally sucked it up. Really I did, it was horrible, but what can you do. Then after that, I came home and really did nothing. I just kinda did nothing. I just said that didn't I, oh well. But it was an awesome day outside. It was b e a utiful outside. Like 70 degrees, sunny. It was amazing. Then at 5 we went out to dinner for my dad. We had to register my brother at Bradley for his basketball camp first though. So we went there, and then went to Lo's Drive-in. I got chilli cheese fries which were really good, and an awesome choclote shake. Then after that we had to take my brother back to Bradley and then we went and visited my Step Grandpa, well kinda step. But they are the funniest people ever! I love them it was great just to talk to them. They are so upfront and say whatever, it's great. I love people like that. We stayed there for about an hour and a half and then went and picked up my brother from Bradley and then went home. I totally forgot about my APS. So I had to do all of it. We got home around 9:30, and I hadn't started any of it. But I just finished it 2 hours later. Oh well, at least I'm done. All I have to do is go wash my face and brush my teeth and then fall into bed. I'm going to be dead for summer school tomorrow but I always am so it's nothing new. I didn't get to talk to Amanda today though :-(. That made me sad, well I can see her tomorrow after summer school. So that's good. Well, I'm going to finish listening to my Brand New and then going to bed. See some of you tomorrow at 7:30 to learn about the Goverment and such!

      I got up today to my brother and Chase screaming over how they won this game or something. I wasn't very happy. Then I just took my shower and really did nothing. My cousins came over with my uncle and we hung out for a few hours. Then I had to clean my whole room which was a mess so it took awhile. My sister and her boyfriend are coming to stay here tonight like at 3:30 AM, and he is sleeping in my bed. So it has to be all clean and all that, and I had to move some of my stuff up to my brothers room. After that, we went over to Peoria and went to church at St. Vincint de Paul. It's always packed there so I had to stand the whole time. Which isn't that bad actually, I kinda like it. After church we went over to the new mall and I bought some awesome Puma's because I needed new shoes, I wanted some Addias from Gallians, but no they didn't have them, stupid Gallians. And guess what, Footlocker didn't have them either, but my Puma's are cool so it all works out. Then we went to Old Navy and I found a shirt for a dollar and 79 cents. Now that is a deal. It was the ugliest thing I have ever seen, it was a brown long sleve kinda sweater/shirt thing. I didn't buy it, but I thought it was cool that it was only $1.79. Then we went to the CAT store because my dad wanted a new shirt. I found that CAT has some hott shoes, but they were like 90 bucks. But they were the coolest things ever, when I start working soon, I'm gonna buy a pair. They are hott. Then we went to Sams, for no apparent reason, were there, and were just like, "why are we here?" So we left and then went to Cubs and my mom bought some stuff. And then we came home, and had Taco Bell for dinner. After that, I went outside and played basketball with my dad, and then Amanda came over and we talked for about an hour. She was cold, and lied and said she wasn't! lol you are awesome Amanda! After she left I just came inside where I am now. Really bored. Just listening to music. My fav. Brand New is playing right now. You have to love them, they are just that amazing. Well I need sleep, have a great night! Aloha!

      Well, today I had a test in APS. I get there, and I really didn't study for it. Because I'm just that stupid, and procrastinated so I only had 15 minutes to study. But oh well. I start taking the test, and I like how Mr. Reem sets it up. He is a really cool and a very good teacher, haven't had one of those for awhile now. So its good to have him. But his test, we were given a time limit. And I really cut it short. I was like 2 minutes away from the one hour time limit. I wasn't the last one done though! So that made me feel better lol. One girl just took forever, and after I was done, we got a break, and she never came back from the break for a long time. So I'm guessing he gave her extra time to finish. But after the test he gave us a whole hour and let us right fake laws. It actually was pretty interesting. Except for Roxanne who refused to let me write a law with her. I guess I'm not cool enough to write a law with Roxanne, I see how it is! No you're awesome Roxanne don't worry. But then he let us out like 5 minutes early, so me and Kayla went out and I walked her half way down the road while I waited for my mom to come pick me up. She did, and then I came home. I really didn't do anything at home. Just listened to music. Then I called Andrew and asked if he wanted to go play basketball with me at Taylors. So I walked over there, and then it started to rain, but we didn't care so we headed off to Taylors. We got there, and were wet so, we still wanted to play because we were already wet and so why not get more wet lol? So we went out there and they both kicked my butt in Xylophone and Pianist. Yeah you heard me right! Xylophone and Pianists. Thats what kinda of basketball games us bandos play. The we played some music, and I watched Andrew and Taylor play for a little. And then me and Taylor watched Andrew teach soccer to Taylors brothers and sisters. But, then Andrew ran into a tree, and you can fill in the rest from there. Lol you're a smart one arn't you buddy? Those trees just fly out from nowhere. Then Taylor had to go get ready so me and Andrew walked home. Then I got home, and made my family breakfast food for dinner. You got to love when that happens. I love breakfast food for dinner, its so different. Because it's breakfast, at dinner time! WOW! Amazing right? Yeah thought so. Well then I just kinda did nothing. But then my parents asked if I wanted to go on a drive with them. So I did, and we went to really cool places that I didn't even know excisted in Washington. They were really far out in the country, and they were huge houses. I want to live there. They were probably around 10 minutes away from town, they are that far out. I like that. We took our dog along to, so I played with her in the car. She is still soar from getting fixed though. Poor girl, that shouldn't be legal, cutting out her stuff like that. Ewwy! Well after our driving we got home, and I got online and talked to Amanda. I said I would talk about her in this. Because she is just one of the coolest people in the world! I'm taking forever to type this lol. I'm sorry :-). Well really thats all I have to say. I'm tired, but its the weekend, so who goes to bed on the weekends? Oh yeah, I do sometimes, oh well. See-ya later!

      Wow, I do not want to study for my APS test tomorrow. So I'm stalling, even though its already 10:00 at night. Oh well. Well after what I already did today which I said in my last post. I really did nothing else. Haley called and asked if I could give her and Ele a ride to band, so I left to go pick them up and went to band. We had Karth again. He gets out the stupid gock block. That man is nuts. But that's how it goes. But then they bribe us to go by giving us candy, which I guess all works out. Ele's mom gave me a ride home, and then I got online. My parents then told me I was going to Dairy Queen. So sorry I couldn't be outside when you went by Amanda. I wanted to though! I saw you driving there though! :-) Which made my night, so I'm in a happy mood right now. But I just found out someone found out my password. So if someone IMs  you on "A Lost Solution" (an old screen name i used to have) it's NOT me. So do not listen to them, and block them. People are out to ruin me, and I don't know why. It's getting really old though. Especially when I have done thing wrong to any of them. Well you can't let those people get to you. They are just sad, and I know how they got the SN now to. Which was very uncalled for by the kid. Who used to be against all this, but now some how is part of it. But yeah! My old password was jtbk13. I made it when I was 10 years old and the JT stands for a girl (Julia Thomspon) I met at a camp I went to (cute huh?), oviously the bk is me and I needed two numbers, so I picked 13. Just incase you didn't hear already. Well I really need to study, have a great night! Later!

      Yeah it's still suspended. None of you can read this because I'm typing this in note pad. So hahaha beotches! Well if this is up that means I'm not suspended anymore. Yay! And if it's not up for awhile. You can blame the people who have no lives and posted over 400 comments in less than one hour. Yeah, that have no life. Oh well. Well I didn't write yesterday, which was Wendsday if you're just clueless. So what did I do yesterday? Well I got up, which sucked, because I didn't fall to sleep well at all, I got 4 hours of sleep at the most. So yah, that really sucked as you can imagine. And then I went to APS, APS isn't that bad actually. I really like Mr. Reem, he is really cool, which makes the class actually okay. But we had homework to draw maps, we were suppose to have a lot more, but he cut it down a lot which was really cool of him. After that, me and Ryn walked home, and I really did nothing after that. I just hung out at home, and then KLT called me and asked if I wanted to go to hollands with her and Haley. So I went up there and we stayed there for awhile. Then we walked to KLT's and we played with Amandakins, that's KLT's name for her baby sister Amanda. You are wierd KLT. But then, we had to get a chair and clean it, because that was KLT's present to her dad for fathers day. She bought him a chair, so we had to get it out. Haley got out of it lol, not fair. But then we got it out, and she vacummed it and then we went inside for awhile. And then I rode home. My parents made nachoes for dinner, yummy! After that, I finished my APS, and just listend to music. And then Natelie called me and told me to go outside. So I did, and Amanda, the coolest person in the world!! came over! We talked for awhile. And then she had to go home. But it was awesome. After that, I went back inside and watched Summerland because I taped it from Tuesday. Man you got to love that show. But it's not as good as One Tree Hill, man I can't wait for the fall when that comes back on. Haley off that show, man, you can just look at my buddy icon to see what I mean. After that I just talked online, and then I went and washed my face and brushed my teeth and did all that. Then I watched some of Jay Leno, animals were on. And I really like animals so that was cool. Then I went to bed. And now on to today. Today I woke up at the normal early time of 6:15, then I got ready and headed off to school. Today in APS we took our notes and reviewed for the test. We also got split up into politcal parties for an activity we're gonna do. Well the irony about it, me and Ryn were Republicans. Well both of us are strongly democrats. So yeah, it sucks for us lol. We have to fight for laws in this activity we don't even agree with. But I guess that's the point of this activity. It should be interesting however. We have a test tomorrow, I have never took a test with Mr. Reem. So I don't know how it will be, I'm gonna study, but hopefully it's easy. Because studying in the summer does not look fun. So hopefully it's easy. After school, my mom came and picked me up and I just came home. Then after awhile, Andrew asked me if I wanted to come over, so I went over there. He played some mad guitar, man I wish I could do that :-/ oh well. Maybe some day! But then after that, we went to Mcdonalds which was good. Taylor, we saw your brother there, he was all alone though, so me and Andrew were going to be his friends for a little lol. After going to Mcdonalds, we rode back to his house and played Tony Halk for about 10 minutes. And then we walked up to the high school because he had leadership, which I couldn't do sadly, but oh well! So after that, I wanted something to drink so I road to CVS and bought an apple juice and then rode home. Now I'm at home and I have nothing to do. I'm just talking online. Well I'll find something. Well, see-ya!

      As of right now I am suspended from writing in this journal. I'm just writing this in note pad, so if this is up, that means I'm not suspended anymore! CJ and Mercer, I believe it was them or it could be someone else but its probably them, posted over 400 comments in less than one hour. To prove to everyone they have no life, probably. But those 400 comments, and me trying to remove them all at once, got it suspended. But I emailed them, and hopefully they unsuspend it soon, but like I said, if you're reading this, it's already unsuspended. Well yesterday, I drove myself out of bed, it was hard let me tell you. Getting up sucks, really really bad. And then going to school in the summer is just depressing, but at least i'll get it out of the way. It's better to take it for one month, then to take it a whole semester. Well hopefully it is. And plus, me taking summer school means I don't have to have 0 hour my second semester. So that is always a plus. Well after summer school I came home and then just waited and then at lunch time me and my family went to Pizza Hut which was good. Pizza is good. I like pizza. Exspecially lots of it. After that, I came home and I was so tired. SO I took a three hour nap. It was nice, but I got up, and had a crap load of homework to do, so I did my two hours of APS, and then off to band I went. No one was really there, me and Haley were talking about ditching it lol. But we stayed, with the Mr. Karth as dirtector. Yuck! I do not like that man. But I got through it, we actually have some cool songs for this years show. I just hope the drill is cool. But then after that, I came home and got online and talked for a little. And then I went outside and played basketball. I then just talked online and waited for my account to get unsuspended. Well, that's really all I have to say. Later.

      I really did nothing after I last posted. I did my APS homework. And that was really depressing to have homework in the summer. But that's how it goes. I kinda did it off and on and really did nothing. And then I went up to the pool and swam for a little to just unwind. Then, I ... ummm ... yeah! I did nothing else lol. Wait! I went outside and played basketball. Oh and on my way home from the pool, I was about at my house, and i can see my dad letting my dog out. Well there are two old people going down the road in a hover round. Well it turns out that my dog thinks he can take there wierd hover round things she has never seen before. So she takes off down the road after them. Well she catches up and I'm really close to them and my dad yells at me to get her. But the old guy was so awesome. He was like "Aw, the dog finally thought he could take on something his own size, let him run after us, he is just having fun." Well my dog sees that I'm there so she stops. And I run and pick her up, and then take her back to my dad. It was pretty funny. Well I guess you would of had to of been there. Well I really have nothing else to say. I have to get up at 6:30 tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to that, but oh well, what can you do. Well I have nothing else to say. Have a good night! See some of you tomorrow bright and early!

      Well yesterday was a fun day. I got up and took my shower and just kinda hung out for a little. And then me and Andrew walked around together and then went and visited Haley. We looked at her pictures and played with her TalkGirl, great times. We ate a lot of gummy bears and I put these little things in Roxanne's hair just to annoy her. Because I'm cool like that. You liked it Roxanne. We stayed till around 4:30, and then we walked back to Andrew's got his bike, and then went to my house and I got my bike. We then road up to see a really cool car. And then we road back to Andrews house and he kicked my butt in Tony Halk. Then, I had to go, I was going to have to watch my brother, but he was invited by a friend to go to the pool, so my parents took me out to Pizza Hut instead. And then I got home from that, and Kyle asked if I wanted to go ride around with him. So he came over, and then we started to go on our regular bike ride to K-Mart. Well the wierdest thing happend. I was riding along right? And there was this bird in the road, I really didn't think anything of it. I was right in my path, and you know they move before you even get close. Well this one didn't, but I really still didn't think anything of it. Because it still had time to move. Well, It didn't. I look down, and I see this bird, and then I see my tire just run over it. I just scream omg! And Kyle says the same thing because he heard the crack. It was the wierdest thing, after I ran over it, it kinda flapped its wings a little bit, wobbled over to the side of the road, and then just feel over. I felt bad, but why didn't it move? I was going like 3 MPH on my bike. I think it was stoned or something. But may that bird rest in peace. Well, after that wierd phomonon, me and Kyle take the new bike path to K-mart because its a really good ride. Well we get to K-Mart and go for the drink isle like normal. And let me tell you, K-Mart sucks. They have nothing to drink. At all. So after that we go take a look at the CDs. We leave our mark like we usually do by messing with the little signs they have. It's fun, and they never fix them so there always the same way everytime we go back. But we were thristy so we go over to Krogers. We get there, and we both find a drink we want. Even though Krogers really didn't have anything either. And I was really mad about that, stupid Krogers. I can't wait till you go out of buisness when the new Super Walmart comes. But I buy my chocolate milk and Kyle buys a soda. And then we see someone. Well, we decided we wanted to wait to see this someone again. So we just sit outside the store on our bikes. Well in this time I coudln't get my stupid chocolate milk open. Kyle couldn't either. It wasn't the cap, it was the little sealing they put over it. Well Kyle finally got it open for me and then we see the person come out. Wow, I could sit there all day. Yes I know I'm a loser shut up. But then we ride home, and the way home, we get really lucky. We think it was the bird, we don't know. But it was hott. So we ride around and then Kyle went home. And then I went over to Andrews again, and played Tony Halk with him, and Steffan. Then, I went outside to go home. And there were people standing there. Well they call me over to talk to them. And it happend to be Whitney, Amy, and Amanda (I remembered your name :-) so we talked for about 20 minutes. It was really cool. We just sat outside and talked lol. Then I went home and got online. I talked to alot of people and then KLT called me. This was around 10:30. Well, me and KLT talk for awhile like we usually do. Well we end up talking till 12. And I had to get up at 6:15 the next day. So I got like 6 hours of sleep. Oh well. So I got up today and then got ready, and then went off to a joyous day of summer school. Got to love American Politcal Science Honors. Wow, why did I ever think about taking that!? School in the summer!? It's crazy. I could of just took it during the year, but no, I wanted to get it over with. Man, am I stupid. But actually it wasn't that bad. I was lucky and got Kayla right behind me where I sit, Ryn right beside me, Roxanne diagnole from me, and Bree right in front of me. So I actually got a very good seat in the seating arangment. But the sucky thing is, I already have homework to do. Oh well, I guess getting this class over with is a good thing. Even though I have to be there at 7:30 every morning. I can deal. Well after summer school me and Ryn walked home, I got home and let my dog out. She was going crazy. Then I just have done nothing. I got a blow though to me, someone who I thought was my friend, I guess isn't. They can be that way all they want. Maybe I'm not perfect enough for them. Well I'm glad I'm not. If they can't except me, well then screw them! Well thats really been pretty much all I have done today. But I keep getting annoyed by all these people who have these picturetrail things. They really bug me, once one girl gets them, its like a huge chain of followers. They are the ugliest things ever. Just ditch picture train and make your own thing. It's not that hard. Some things even do it for you. But those things really bug me. Oh well, I bet this things really bugs some of you, oh wait! I know it does because some of you have told me. But good, I hope it does :-) Well time to go!

      Wow today was a hot one people. Over 90 degrees. Now that is just crazy right there. I was going to go to the pool, but I knew it was going to be packed because it was so hot. It's just that crazy. So I just stayed home. But then me and my parents and brother decided to go over to Peoria. We went to Target, went out to eat at Avantis, and then went to the new mall. It was pretty fun. Then I got home and noticed I had a huge virus on my computer. So because of that, I had to reformat my computer. I wasn't happy as you can tell because reformating takes a long time. So me and my dad did it. And alot of the time is wasted because you dont' have to do anyhting, so I went outside and played basketball. And then something freaky happend. Someone came running, and screaming, and jumped on top of me. I thought I was going to be raped 20 times over. But it just happend to be my good old buddy Andrew. He was walking around, and then he walked to my house. So I went with him and we went back to his house. We played some Primus, which is the coolest band ever, because they are just that random and talk about lost puppies. Anyone that talks about lost puppies is my hero. And then he kicked my butt in some hardcore online games. You got to love Slime Volleyball. If you don't, there is something wrong with you. But he rules at that. And I just suck. Hopefully things get better for ya Andrew. I'm praying that they do. But then after that, it was dark, and I didn't tell my parents where I was going lol, so his mom took me home. But I didn't get in trouble, so that's a plus. And then my dad poped in a movie that we watched. Well I talked online while watching it, becuase I already have seen it. But its an okay movie. And then me and Danetta had a little argument. Danetta, you arn't changing my mind. I did it in your best interests. No matter what you say :-) But really that was my night. Now I'm going to go get some food. Goodnight!

      Yeah, I didn't write yesterday I noticed too. That's because I was up arguing in a chat room till 1 AM. It was a good chat wasn't it Nick? But before all that, after I was disgusted at Mcdonalds, I came home and did nothing. I just sat at home and then around 6:00 my dad asked me if I wanted to go to the pool with him and my brother. So I did and swam a little with Tony and Mark because they were there. Then I decided to walk home. So I walked home and got dressed and then just listened to music. And then my sister told me some of my friends where here. It was Brian and Melissa. They walked over to visit me. We came down in my basement and had some pretty interesting converstaions lol. Remember your drawing Melissa, I forgot to throught it away lol, but my dad did and I don't think he saw it lol becuase it was all crumpled up in a ball. And remember how Brian was molested as a child :-) Nah, I'm just joking with you Brian. You two need to come and visit me more often. I emailed you Brian like you told me too! Well they stayed till around 9:20 and then Melissa's mom came and picked them up. Then, I went and got online, and CJ was just be a retard, he kept making Andrew show me all this stuff because CJ "had to talk to me" for some reason. So I unblock him, and he is just being his stupid self. We get into the argument of Animals and reason again. And we find out CJ is wrong like always. He still believes dogs can reason, I find it pretty funny how he won't give it up. He kept telling me that I'm stubborn, and I tell him all the times I actually said I was wrong, but he would not give it up, even after me and Nick told him too. He didn't though, because he just thinks he has to prove he is better than me. He said next time I annoy him or something he is gonna hurt me physically. And I laughed and went, "oh yeah that proves awhole lot doesn't it CJ" and he got all mad and said I'm gonna get hurt and all this. Well CJ if you have to become physical to try to prove to everyone you are somebody, you're sad. You are one of those sad people that the commercials talk about on TV about violence. I actually kinda feel sorry for you. But if beating me up proves anything to you, you need help. If I annoy you, maybe you should just leave me alone. Because you even said I leave you alone. But thats another story. After that I found something out that I wasn't really happy about. Not that they have it, just how it got there, and even both of them. Hmm, I'll have to find out. Well after my chat room about the animals with reason, I washed my face and headed off to bed. Then, I got up, and took my shower and went up to get a hair cut. And guess what, it's short. Yes you heard it right, its all gone, i have short hair. It's nice now that I don't have to do anyhtign to my hair now, I can just get up and go. And it won't look like a frow anymore which is a plus. So I'm happy about it. After that, I just came home and its really hot outside. Let me check the tempature. Yeah the "feels like tempature" is 90. That's crazy. At least my new hair cut will keep me cool a little. But yeah, I had pizza rolls and fries for lunch. They were good. And now I'm just listening to music, and just keeping cool. That's about it. Well I'll talk to you later! See-ya

      Well I decided to make a special post just dedicated to this. I found it really disgusting. So after my last day of being a leader at Vacation Bible School my dad said I could pick where me and my brother wanted to go out to eat. So I decided Burger King. Well we got there and I'm like you know what, I can get this cheaper at Mcdonalds. So I go back to the car and tell my dad to go to Mcdonalds. So I get into Mcdonalds and I'm struck by a guy with no shirt on. I felt really disgusted. It's not the fact that he didn't have a shirt on, but it was because he was in Mcdonalds ordering food without a shirt on. And I look on the door, and it says "No shoes, No shirt, No Service" And i'm like oviously they arn't keeping up to that. So I order my food with this nasty guy with no shirt on next to me. I get it and walk out as fast as possible. So I'm really disgusted right, so I find the Mcdonalds Comment line on my bag. So my dad told me to give it a call, so I whip out my cell phone and give Mcdonalds a call. And tell them how disgusted I was. The guy is like yeah, that's not our standards, and he took my name and address and all that. So hopefully they get me something free. I know thats buying me off, but I don't care, its free at least. Maybe I should call the health deparment too, because our Mcdonalds got a 100% on there inspection, and oviously, that shouldn't be happening. But hopefully I'll get something free. You're nasty Mcdonalds. Well, that's all I had to say.

      I didn't write anything yesterday except that quote. I thought it was a really cool quote. It's a great movie where I got it from. I watched that yesterday. "O". It's amazing. Yesterday all I did was go to Vacation Bible School, go to peoria with my mom, sister, and brother, get godfathers pizza, and then eat it, and then watch "O". That was really about it. Today, I got up, went to Vacation Bible School, got home from that and did... absolutely nothing. I just sat at home. I walked up to the pool because it stoped raining and it was actually pretty warm, but it was closed. How stupid is that. The pool is getting worse and worse with this new managment. First the picture IDs and now this. They are killing me here. So after that I took my dog on a walk. She is sycko, i don't think thats how you spell it. But she would like run all over the place and almost choke herself to death on her leashe. I think she would finally get the point that she can't get away from it. Even with bitting it. Wow freaky. Then I got home, and just did nothing. After that me and my family finally decided to go get a movie. Well by now it was storming like crazy. And my mom felt like going to the Dollar General to buy some cheap stuff. So we drove her all the way down there, and my dad wanted to go trade in his change jar for money. So we go to Cefcu. And by now it was crazy crazy outside. And I mean crazy. The roads were like rivers. But, its pooring down rain, and my dad goes to go to the bank. Well he runs to the door, and he tries to open this automatic door, and it won't open, so he runs back. By now me and my brother are just dieing laughing. He is soaked from being out in the rain for just like 30 seconds. But we guess the bank just closed randomly. There were other people there, and they were doing the same thing. No one knows why it was closed. I guess it was just one of lifes mysteries. Even the drive thru's were closed. Freaky. But then we go back to get my mom, she bought an umbrella there and so she used that to walk the litterlly 2 feet she had to. But if she wouldn't of, she would have been drenched. Then, we went to 2nd Cinema, and just my luck, all the movies I wanted were out on DVD and even Video. So yeah, Brent didn't get a movie, but Nathan, my mom, and my dad all did. So that wasn't cool. So I come home and burn 15 CD's because I'm goning to reformat my PC tomorrow and I don't want to lose my 110 music albums I have on it. So yeah, I burned many CDs. Then I just talked to KLT on the phone, and looked and hilarious college quotes. I showed them to Andrew and we both got a kick out of them. But when I was on the phone with KLT. She proclaimed God is a Cross Dresser, and is sexists. But then she says she thinks God is a girl. She is one crazy lady. What would I do without you KLT. But now I am just watching Jay Leno, Vin Disel is on. He is one muscular guy. He could break me like a stick. I should be in bed by now, but oh well. I have to get up tomorrow like at 7:00 then go to church, and I have to do the Response Sorial Psalm. And watch little kids. Wow, not gonna work well. But oh well. Well, I need to at least go get ready for bed. This girl on Jay Leno, I can't tell if I think she is hott or just looks to hott which could make her ugly. It's wierd. Well I really need to go. Nite

      All my life I always wanted to fly. I always wanted to live like a hawk. I know you're not supposed to be jealous of anything, but...to take flight, to soar above everything and everyone, now that's living. But a hawk is no good around normal birds. It can't fit in. Even though all the other birds probably wanna be hawks; they hate him for what they can't be. Proud. Powerful. Determined. Dark. Odin is a hawk. He soars above us. He can fly. One of these days, everyone's gonna pay attention to me. Because I'm gonna fly too.  - Hugo, in "O", a modern retelling of Othello

      I volunteered at Vacation Bible School again today like I will be doing all week, it's actually not bad. I have a really cool group of little kids, so they make it fun. After that though I just came home and did nothing! At all, today I sat at home. Oh wait, my mom took us to Taco Bell, which can't be beat. So I did do something, but we just went through the drive-thru so I don't know if that counts. But after that I sat at home! Like I have been doing alot lately. But I got to watch Summerland tonight. It was amazing, I was dieing from One Tree Hill not being on till the fall, so this temporary replacement works wonders. It's even on at the same time. It diserves a cookie! But, next week Braiden is going to do drugs for this very very hott girl. Her hottness makes him do it, she is just that hott. That lucky bastard him, with that hott girl. But she does drugs, so thats a major turn off. Girls I won't like you like that if you do drugs. So don't do drugs! But that show is awesome. Oh! And a great great movie is on The WB tomorrow night at 7:00 PM. It's "O" with the one and only Julia Styles. It's an amazing story, it's a remake of Shakespeare's Othello for all you deep poetry people out there. And oviously Julia Styles is just hott, so that makes it extra hott. So watch it at 7. And, does anyone wanna buy me a digital camera? Because I asked my parents for one, and they said the good old no. So if anyone wants to buy me a $150 dollar digital camera for an awesome gift for your great friend Brent I would love you. Well thats really about it. I have to go download the Sugarcult CD, because somehow it's mysteriously gone off my computer. Sounds like Nathan needs some explaining to do. Well bye!

      I had to get up today at 7:00, and then I got ready and then since my mom thought it was a good idea, I had to ride my bike with my brother to Vacation Bible School. I volunteered to be a leader there this week. So I get there, and one person younger than me who also was voluteering like tried to tell me what to do. Well Ellan, I'm sorry but you aren't allmighty. And no, I wasn't going to go into the gym then, or anytime. Don't tell me what to do. K? :-) So I got my group, which is a really cool group by the way. Then we sang songs and danced. You can imagine how that was. But! I had Natelie become my co-leader for the day because she was a volunteer there and had no group. So she joined mine. So me and Natelie went around with our group and when they were in there little session things we went down and got a drink. Then there was more, dancing. And stail ice cream cones. They were nasty Natelie, along with the Kool-aid. Then there was more singing and dancing. Then we went home. Once I got there I just kinda hung out until 2:30 and then I walked up to the pool and swam for a little. Not long though probably only about 10 minutes at the most. It was packed, so I wasn't a big fan of that. And there were also these obnoxious 8 year olds that were annoying me because they think they were cool. Well I put an end to that quick. I got home and layed outside for about 10 minutes and then KLT called and asked if I wanted to go to Hollands with her and Haley. So I went and we stayed there for about an hour and 15 minutes, until I found a hair in the popcorn and ran outside. I almost threw up. It was really really nasty. I went home and my parents had dinner ready. So I ate and then just went outside or stayed inside, what ever I felt like every 10 minutes. It changed alot. But just about 10 minutes ago, I was walking outside and it was dark, and this car kept driving by me, I even saw him turn around in the pool parking lot and drive past me twice! I was pretty freaked out. So I walked home really fast. and I mean really fast. Then I got inside and now I'm writing this. For Love or For Money is on. Let me tell you girls, you are morons if you don't pick a million dollars. If you pick "love" from a guy you have only met like 10 times for about 15 minutes each, over 1,000,000 dollars. You are the studest person ever. Well, I have to get up early again tomorrow. I wonder how everyone is doing who went on the Kings Island trip. That was way to early to get up and get home for me to go. Well, I'm gonna go get some food. Later.

      Today was really almost the same as yesterday. Except minus a few parts making it more borning. I got up, took a shower, and just listend to music and went outside. Then I walked up to the pool and bought a candy bar and a cup of water. We should not have to pay for a cup of water. But it was good water so I really can't complain. Then I came home and went to Krogers with my dad and brother. And then just played outside and talked to my dad. And really thats all I did. Everyone is going to Kings Island tomorrow. Andrew says I should sneek into one of his carry on bags. But, I don't know getting up at 3:30 in the morning to make it up to the school by 4 AM doesn't sound to appleasing. Thats why I didn't go in the first place. But I have to get up early tomorrow still. 7:00 at least not 4:00. I'm volunteering at my churches Vacation Bible School. So I get to help little kids learn about the Bible. So that should be good. Maybe I'll go to hollands afterwards or something with KLT and Haley. I'm doing that all week though so it should be fun. Today was the 60th Anniversery of D-Day. So that's cool. Well, I need to go get ready to go to bed or I won't be able to get up tomorrow. Good Night!

      The pool opended for the first time today. Me and my family went up to go get our passes and they made us go to the stupid Park District to get our stupid pictures taken, we have to carry I a picture ID to get into the pool these days. It's crazy, things aren't what they were the before. First the Gus Macker is coming here and now this! But that's the way it goes. After I got my pass my dad and brother drove up to the pool, and I decided I didn't want to go. But then, I decided to just go buy a candy bar. So I walked up there and talked to Candace for a little. And then I talked to Mary. Thanks for the candy bar Mary ;-) Then I walked home, and went to church. Then me and my family went over to Grand Pairie. I got two pairs of pants and Old Navy and two pairs of sweats that were only $3.97 each. And my pairs of pants were only $9.99 each. I got out with a deal in that store. Well I didn't, my parents did at least lol. Then we went to this new Mexican Grill over in Grand Prairie. Which was really good. Then we came home and I played basketball outside in the dark listening to music for about an hour. Then I just came inside and kinda just did nothing. It's just a blur of my last 2 hours. Don't know why. Oh well. Brian and Andrew just got home, which is cool. And on a sad note, Former President Ronald Reagan died today at the age of 93. He was my very first president, and he was only president for me, for about 5 hours. I was born on the day he left office, the day George Bush Sr. got sworn into to office. But President Regan was still my president for about 5 hours until the ignogoration took place for George Bush. So may Ronald Reagan rest in peace. God Bless and I'll pray for ya. Well back to my boring night. See-ya.

      Today, got off to a slow start. I didn't do anything at all. All day. But that's alright. My dad came home and then we went to the Kapraun Family Benefit and had some spagehetti. Which was good because I liked the food. It was yummy. Then I got dropped off at home while the rest of my family went to Wal-mart because I didn't feel like going. Then I went to Harry Potter 3. Those Harry Potter movies get more and more bizarre every time. This one, they had a bird-horse, a rat that turns into be the killer of Potter's parents. Ouch, I'm mean, pretend you didn't hear that :-) But I told you not to read this. So that's your problem. But it was one bizarre movie. But it was actually okay. Then I came home, and I burned a CD for my KLT. And now I'm really tired. So after I'm done talking to Mary. I'm going to bed. Oh yeah! Andrew and Brian come home tomorrow. Which is awesome. And Haley is leaving tomorrow for her mission trip, so pray for her! Well I'm gonna go. Later!

      I got up again today to hearing my loud brother. This time though luckly he was coming home from school and it was about 9:45, so I was okay with that. I got up and didn't get ready until 11:30. My mom brought home Garlic Cheese Bread from Little Ceasors. It was yummy. Then I got ready, and went over to Kyles. From there we went to Nancys, K-Mart, Walmart. We were trying to find a camo shirt for him. But we couldn't find any. So then we went back to his house where I beat him in pool. Yes, I won in pool its amazing I know. After that I went home and then Aimee came and picked me up to go to the cherry festivle. I didn't ride any rides. My moto is "if the person running the ride is missing teeth, I'm not riding it." So that means all the rides were out of the picture so I didn't go on any. It saved me 10 bucks so that was a plus. But then Aimee had to leave because she had to get up early to go to work, so I went and hung out with Haley, Jenny, Abby, Roxanne, Ele, and Julie to watch Heroes By Nite. They are a great band. Amazing 3 out of the 4 came from Washington. And the other he might of, he is from around here I know that, he just went to Peoria Christian. But they were amazing. All thier songs were original. Which is hard to come by these days. But after two songs, they were starting to talk about God and how he was good. And then Alan just screams out "Show us your boob!" This is right when Kyle Yocum the main singer goes we are here tonight for God, and then you here Alan go "Show us your boob!" Well this was oviously very out of place. And everyone laughed for a second and then just gave him evil stars. So he left. But after the concert, his mom was looking for him. And she was screaming for him lol. I was wierd. And right now, I'm talking to Haley and she said he was caught by the cops up at the square. That's one crazy kid. But go check out Heroes By Nite. They are amazing. I'm hoping they are going to play again in Washington, and then I'll buy one of their CDs next time. I should of got one this time. Oh well, if anyone has it, you would be awesome if you would let me make a copy of it. Alright, well I'm tired. Nite.

      Today, I got up at 8:30 because my stupid brother is to loud. You don't have to be that loud to go to school. Actually when I go to school, I'm perfectly quiet. He just needs to shut up that stupid retard. Screaming about a stupid water gun, god. Oh but I love you Nate. So I got up, and had nothing to do because I have no life! I sat inside all the way till 7:30 tonight. Well my mom brought me home two Cheesy Gordia Crunch's from Taco Bell so that was good. Wow I would die for those things. I found out my good old friend Jerry is into Brand New finally. After about two years, at least someone else has some good taste in music. But other than that I sat at home doing nothing because I have no life. Then, Kyle asked me if I wanted to go riding at 7:30 so I said yes because I oviously had nothing else to do. So we rode around, went to K-Mart, Stopped by the Cherry Festivle for a little, then just rode around till about 8:50. It was cool but for the first half hour it like peed on us from the sky. Stupid mist, you can burn. But then it stopped so it was all good on earth again. Kyle, I still can't believe that girl. Totally lost all my expecations for her. Oh well, that's life. Some of you might have seen just that part of the article. That's because I stopped in the middle of writing this and went upstairs. So I thougth what the heck I'll publish half of it. So that's what I did. I really have nothing else to say. I just ate some beef stew. That was good. Donut holes are good too, just had some of those also. I was talking to Haley and made myself look like a complete idiot when I asked where Arkansas is, I still feel really wierd about it. I never knew that was how it was spelled. It has Kansas in it so I was like Ar-Kansas? I was so confused. But then she explained lol. And I'm an idiot. Well I have nothing else to say.

      I got up around 11:00 today. Did nothing till 4:00. Then Kyle came over and I burned him a CD and we hung out till like 5:30. Then he left and then my night started to suck. I might be dropping out of my summer school class and take it during the year. I don't know yet. So tonight, I spent the night mostly outside, except for watching the new show Summerland, which was actually pretty good. But then I just went out side and took a jog around my neighboorhood to clear my mind. Someone is posing as me on this. I have my thoughts that it's Brent Mercer so really he wouldn't be posing as me, just using my his name but acting like me. Which is really retarded. But whoever it is, they have no life to create a profile almost exactly like mine, and even a journal. Wow you take the time to actually do things like that. Get a freaking life you loser. You are just proving you have no life. But you think you're cool so keep doing it. I can just delete them. It's that easy. So everyone if someone posts as "brent" and it doesn't sound like me. It's not me, and the will be deleted when I come. Alright, Jay Leno is on. See-ya

      Well I have been really busy lately so sorry I haven't written in this much. I have been slacking off this month in these posts. But I have been really busy lately so sorry. Last week, I'm gonna try to remember it, but I don't know if I will be able too. It was two weeks ago so yeeeaahh. But I finished summer school last week. That was a nice accomplishment. No more APS which is always a nice plus. I turned in my term paper and everything. In the last week we really had nothing to do, he would always let us out early and we would just watch movies. We watched this comedic documentary called "Journey's with George." It was about George Bush and his presscore. It was actually really good and funny. It made me look at George Bush in a better light too, which is a hard thing to do, but I guess he isn't that bad of a man. He just sucks as president. But yeah, on Friday, we just went in there, and people turned in their term papers and we watched our final project videos. Me and Ryn, or Ryn and I for you english people,&nbsp;made ours in light of John Kerry oviously. We had George Bush endorse John Kerry, it was pretty good. We made him eat ketchup since John Kerry's wife is the billioniar&nbsp;heir of the Heinz company. And then we worked "as normal people" for our second commerical. But after we played all our videos it was only like 8:30, so he just let us go that early. So, I was relieved to be done with summer school, but I had to go home and make sure all my stuff was packed because I was leaving for Chicago at 10:00. So I get all my stuff ready and then me and my whole family, because my sisters both came home to go, went up to Chicago. It took about three hours to get there, but it didn't seem that long in the car, and when we first got there, we had the task of finding our hotel. It was crazy, and my family is very disfunctional, but we finally got to the Embassy Suites we were staying at in the Loop. Once we got there, we decided to go on a walk, and we went around the Loop and went to Michigan Avenue and went to stores that like no one can afford to shop there, or at least we can't lol. But, we just walked around and went to Water Tower Place and stuff like that. It was fun. Then we came back to the hotel and got free drinks because that's what the hotel gives you I guess. The adults got free alcohol, and us minors got Sprite with Grindeen in it. But, my dad and my mom and my sister tried some alcoholic drinks, and I got to try some of theres, and let me tell you, I would rather have Sprite with the&nbsp;cherry crap in it, over the alcohol any day. I don't see why people love to drink so much, it's so nasty tasteing. Oh well, I'll figure it out when I'm 21 I guess. But then we just went around again, in chicago its crazy which is always fun. And we did the same on Saturday, but on Saturday, we decided we were gonna be cool and ride the L. So we went on the L and rode that to the end, and then rode it back, just because we are cool like that. And then, I went and bought a smoothie at this really cool Health Grocery Store/Cafe which was really good and really really cheap. I even got a free energy boast in it. For dinner on Saturday, we went to this really really cool restaruant named Benehanas. It's a Japenese restaurant where you have your own personal chef and they make it right in front of you and they do all those tricks with their knives and stuff. It was really cool. I got terriaki steak which was really good, also very expensive. It was very good though and a very good expereince. On Sunday we took another walk and did many other things in chicago, and then we packed up and left the hotel for Shamberg because we wanted to go to that cool IKEA store. So we figured out how to get there and we went there. It's this huge, and I mean huge, blue and yellow store. It has three floors of just tons of stuff for your house. They had esloclators for your carts. It was the coolest store ever. I got a cinumum roll there, which was only one buck and it was really good and big. We stayed there for awhile, and then we drove all the way home. When I got home, I had to unpack, and then wash all my clothes, and then repack for camp. And then I went up to Walmart and saw Jenna and she told me she was trying to get ahold of me and that she could give me a ride to camp. Then I came home and then went over to get Amanda, and then we walked to go see Kyle because he had just finished his sergery on his leg. So we stayed there for awhile and visited him, and then I walked Amanda home, because I had to be home by 8:00 because I still hadn't packed for camp. On the way home, I called and asked if I could go see KLT and Haley since I was leaving and they said yes so I went and saw them. And I walked with them for a little. And then I stayed at KLT's for a little and then I ran home and packed for camp. Then I woke up and made sure all my stuff was packed and then waited for Jenna to come pick me up. And then I went off to camp. I'm going to write about camp in another post then this. It will be after this one because this one is too long to begin with. If I missed anything in last week I'm sorry. I know I missed alot, but I can't remember lol. It's just gone from my memory, I've been to busy to write too. So these things keep getting longer and longer don't they. I probably hung out with Kyle and Amanda and KLT and Haley alot. Oh yeah! And when I got home I had my summer school grades which was an A. But he didn't like my term paper or my final project or anything big I did. He was never like specific though on them, he was just like "write a term paper on this prompt." We'll I did write a term paper on the prompt, so why'd I get a B on it? Oh well, I got an A in the class, and I also got Mr. Blair for my spanish teacher, so I'm happy about that. Well I'm gonna go upstairs and give my cousin a call. I'll write about camp soon. See-ya.

      Alright so I haven't updated this in about a week, so shot me :-D. Well maybe just nothing happend in my life, so I had no reason to write. Well, that's not the case. Well some times it is, becuase this was very rare, but I've actually been way to busy this week to write in this. I have been doing so much stuff. So sit back, and be ready for the longest post I have ever written. This baby is going to be huge, well thats if I can remember all of it. I can't even remember half of it now. But I have been hanging out with Kyle alot. One of the days we went to little ceasors for lunch because you can get a pizza for 5 bucks! And that's just crazy not to go and do that, so we road there. Me and Kyle always have awesome luck and wierd things to. Kyle, going to Krogers first that day was an amazing thing on your part lol. And our trips to K-mart because no one goes to K-mart ever. And then off to Walmart we always go, because people actually go there. We have done that pretty much everyday this week. On Thursday, the 8th, I went out to lunch with Kyle, and then we hung out. And then I went home. And then I went back over there and we watched the Breakfast Club which is the best movie in the entire world! And then we just sat outside for a little, and then Andrew came over and they did thier math, and I just watched them as they did crazy things. Then they finally got most of it done, and we decided we were going out to eat. So me and Kyle had our bikes, and Andrew is crazy and he ran home and we followed on our bikes. Wow, I can never run home I'm not that out of shape. But we got to his house, and he got some money, and then he got his bike, and then we went to my house and I got my money. And then we went to Dairy Queen for dinner. I got two cheese burgers, and I tried some of Kyles Moco Ice thing. I was going to get one, but they are like 4 bucks. And I could get a much better one at Starbucks for the same price. So I decided against paying the 4 bucks and I just tired Kyles. Then after we were all done, we rode to the swimmeet. There I talked to Amanda and everyone and watched Amanda swim. I met Zac who is new, and a really cool kid. And me, Kyle, and Andrew just hung out there. We played cards, which didn't work out well, because people are just plain idiots. And then we just talked for awhile. I talked to Taylor there, I haven't talked to her forever so it was good to talk to her again. And I talked to everyone else there, like Natalie, and just everyone else. Then I had millions of people come up to me and told me to ask Amanda out. So me and Amanda left early, and I walked her home. And we talked for like a half an hour on her driveway, and I did what they told me to, I asked her out :-D. So at around 9:20 on July 8th, 2004, I became a very happy man and got a wonderful girlfriend. Amanda... wow :-D she is just so cool. But then I had to go home because my mom called me and told me to get my brother at the pool and bring him home. So I had to go do that, and then I came home and got online and talked. I found out that Taylor was asked out by Chris on that night too! So we both have like the same day aniversery things! That is so awesome! Natalie enlightend me on that lol. So thanks Natalie! So that's awesome for Taylor and Chris. But, becuase of all that I didn't get any of my term paper accomplished, but oh well. So I just went to bed a happy kid. Then I got up on Friday and went to school. I took a very easy test given by Angle Lee and Abby House. And then Parrot and Collin gave there presentation. And then we had our break, and in our break, we just decided we weren't going back to class. So we just didn't lol and waited till Mr. Reem had to come out and get us. He wasn't mad though which was cool. But what could of he have done to us anyways? Almost half the class was out there lol. But there is always those people who go in and rat us out, which I think two did. But oh well, Mr. Reem is cool. And then after school, I came home and I think I went back out to eat with Kyle and hung out with him again. But I could be wrong, this was awhile ago. But I did all that, and then I came home. And Amanda wanted to go to see Sleep Over with everyone. So me, Kyle, Zac, Marcus who I don't know, Natalie, Kacy, Whitney, and Amanda all went and saw Sleep Over. Wow, was that the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Its for 10 year old girls who need to feel good about themselves, no joke. It's going to put images in there minds to make them think they can do things like that, which they can't. It's just not possible. But after the movie, it was storming out, and we went home. And then I just talked online for awhile, and then went to bed. On Saturday, I woke up and I don't remember what I did. Umm... I think I hung out with Kyle again. But I don't know for sure. I really don't remember what I did on Saturday afternoon. Maybe I didn't do anything, oh well, its a lost in my memory. But I went to church at 5:00 I know that, and I sat with Haley and Kristen, and then afterwards I went out to Mcdonalds with my parents. And I hate how Mcdonalds was so dirty, so I refused to sit in there, so I went outside and sat in the car, that didn't make my parents very happy, but oh well, it's better then sitting in filth. And then after that, KLT and Haley came over, and then Kyle called and we invited him over too. We started to watch the New Guy which is a great movie but they didn't like it lol, so we switched DVD's to Big Trouble with Tim Allen in it. I love that movie to, but Kyle and Haley thought it was retarded lol, but oh well, it had goats and that awesome toad lol! That movie is just so random. But then Haley had to leave around like 8:00 and we just finished watching the movie, and then I called Amanda and asked what she was up to, so we decided to go visit her and Whitney at Whitney's house. So me, KLT, and Kyle walked over there and we talked for awhile, and then we had to leave, so Kyle just road home, and then me and KLT walked back to my house. And we got there and just talked, and then KLT left. And then around 10:25, Amanda called me and told me to go outside, so I went and her and Whitney had walked over! So I talked to them till around 10:50 when they had to leave, and then I went inside and just talked online for awhile, and then I went to bed. Then on Sunday, yes I am almost done with this post, it's long I know, deal with it. But I got up like at 8:00 becaues my family was being so loud. And then around like 8:30, they said they were leaving for Bloomington and if I wanted to go, I needed to get ready. Well I already had stuff planned for the day so I didn't go. So I slept in and then got up and just downloaded like 50 albums till around 12:00, you have to love IRC and free music. And then I had to get ready. At 12:45 I rode over and got Kyle and then we went to Pizza Hut for Bree's going away party thing. We had to wait for a table because pizza hut was packed and we had like 17 people with us. It didn't take as long as we thought it would though. And we just ate tons of pizza becuase oviously its all you can eat. And yeah, I wanted my freaking 6 bucks worth. So I ate alot. Then after we were done, we all decided to go over to Lincoln, and this is the most random thing ever, but so awesomely cool, we played this huge game of dodge ball with like 30 people. It was crazy! It was so much fun though, it was hot outside, but it was just an awesome random thing you do in your life. We played that for over 2 hours, and then me and Ryn walked home and went to his house to start on our APS project. We have to make 2 1 minute commericals on a political figure. It's going to be easy, and were going to make it hilarious. But Mary came over and we didn't get any work done lol, it was a very interesting day lol. But it was hilarious. But then she took us to Taco Bell and payed for us so you have to love Mary! But by all this time, after Taco Bell and when I got home, it was around 7:00. And I still hadn't started on my term paper yet, so I started on that. And then my parents told me someone came over to see me, so I went outside and it was Brian, and we talked for a little. And then some thing out of the very randomness in this world happend. Two clowns, one with a mask of paper, ran at me with squirt guns and squirted me with water for about 2 minutes lol, while I was extremly confused on what was going on in this freaky world. Then they ran off. It was the funniest thing ever. When they ran off I noticed it was Andrew and Kyle lol. Brian just laughed and told me they asked him to come get me outside for they could do that lol. And Kyle just told me to call them the Caped Crusaders lol. But you have to love them. They dressed up in clown out fits and then went through the nieghboorhood to my house like that lol. It was the coolest thing ever lol. But after they ran off, and I was all wet, I went inside and stripped down and put on new clothes. And then Amanda called and told me I could come over and watch a movie. So I got on my bike and rode over there, but on the way there I forgot that it had rained, and since I'm just a moron like that, I rode through some grass, and then I felt all this mud and water splash all over me, and I was all dirty on the clothes I had just changed into lol. But I got to Amanda's and we watches this really bad, sick, nasty, wierd movie called Monster. Never rent that lol, it was just nasty. There was this lesbian couple thing in the movie, and they were the main characters, and one was a hooker who turned serial killer. Yeah, not for kids, or even my age at that lol and I totally wished I had never of saw that movie. But I got to be with Amanda so it was all good lol. But then I had to leave early, because I had to go at least get some more of my term paper done. So I rode home and my term paper put me in a very bad mood. But I got over half of it done, so that's good. Then I just listend to music and talked online till about 10:45, and then I went upstairs and had a sandwhich and a bowl of Rasin Bran, you have to love that Rasin Bran. Then I finally went to bed. And today I got up and went to school, took Parrots and Collin's test from Friday, and then Mollie taught her chapter, and for her game we played Around the World. And man, that brought up memories of grade school and how I loved that game so much. And then we had our break, and then we just talked about politcal stuff afterwards for about an hour with Mr. Reem. Then he let us out 10 minutes early, and I waited for my mom to pick me up, and we gave Ryn a ride home, and then I came home and I started typing this at around 10:30 and now its like 11:00. This thing is huge! Wow, if you read this you have way to much time on your hands, I even have to admit that. I have way to much time on my hands right now to be writing all this. But oh well, I think I'm going to go out to eat with Kyle again today lol. But I need to stop typing this my had is starting to hurt. Well if you just read all this, you are awesome and I owe you a cookie! Maybe even two cookies! Well time to go, have a great day! And sorry again for not updating this for awhile, I'll update the CD of the week when I'm done typing all this. Well see-ya!

      Well I got up yesterday and went to a joyous day of school. Jenny and Kaile taught a lesson, and so did Haley and Roxanne. We played a game and got chocloate and then after school I got a ride home from Tara and then just kinda hung out. Then I rode around with Kyle and went to Nacy's and Kmart, where my great CD labels were still in place from the last time i went, and Walmart where I bought a chocloate milk, but then I spilled it on my kacki shorts, so I wasn't very happy about that. Then we went back to Kyles and just watched some TV and I played Snake II on his cell phone and just listened to music, then I had to go home so I rode home and then just did nothing, then my dad got home and I waited him to cook dinner but I was starving. By then I had a start of a headache so I took some medicane and then just hoped it to go away. But my dad finally cooked dinner, he cooked chicken but there was no barbcue sause, so I just had cooked chicken which isn't my favorite, and then he made this pasta that I hate and only him and my brother like. So I just had the chicken and the rolls, so waiting for dinner was pointless. Then after that, I went down and tried to get my project for APS done which was due the next day, but then Natelie called and told me to go up to the swim meet so I went there and watched Amanda swim, but then I had to come home and do my project again. Then at 8:00 Summerland was on and I haven't watched it for about two weeks so I had to watch it. Braiden lost his virginity in this episode. Great episode lol. But then I had to get back to my project and was doing it during the commericals, and then at 9:00 I was almost done with my project and kinda worked on it while I watched the Real World San Diego "I'm to punk rock for this" reunion. It was pretty good. And then around 10:00 I had my project finised and my head was pounding. I went up to get some more medicane and I told my mom Jessica Simpson has the same kind of dog as us, and then I just went downstairs and went to bed. My head was pounding but I went to bed pretty fast. I got a good nights sleep, and I woke up this morning actually not that tired. I was tired but not as much as usual. And then I went into school a little earlier and had Mr. Reem copy something for my report. And then when school started I had to take Jenny and Kailes quiz which was hard, I don't know how well I did on that. But Haley's and Roxanne's was easy, so after that me and Ryn gave our project and I think it went pretty well. Mr. Reem kept adding stuff, but I think that's a good thing. Because everythign he said, we had, so hopefully I get an A on it, that's all that matters. Everyone got lots of suckers from us, especially Tara, she got tons. But after we gave our report we finished watching the Sex thing on Clarance Thomas, and then it was time to go. I still haven't started my term paper for that class. I'm so screwed. But after school I gave Ryn a ride home but we had to go pick my brother up at golf first. Then I am home right now just doing nothing. I'm bored. Well I'm starving too. Talk to ya later. See-ya.

      Well I hope you all had a great and wonderful 4th of July. I got up that day, and just kinda hung out for awhile. Then I took my shower and all that and got ready. We left around 11:50. I had to find my MP3 player though, and I finally found it, and it was 11:50, but I wanted to put some songs on it, so I ran downstairs and put about 7 on and that took about 4 minutes, while my parents were in the car honking at me. Well I finally finish and run outside, we get in the car and set off for Brimfield. Well, I find out my songs didn't get copied, so I wasn't very happy. I had this hour long of driving and I didn't have anything to listen to, well I did, but just the stuff that was on my MP3 player before, so I didn't listen to it that much. But on the way there we stoped at Cubs because we wanted to bring chicken out, because you could by that and you didn't have to make it. So me and my mom went into go get some, went to tha back to the place where you get the chicken, wait in line, finally we get to the lady that takes forever, and we are already late, but she finally gets there, and goes "you'll have to talk to the chicken man." And we were like alright, so she goes back, and he doesn't come out, she stays there talking for about two minutes, and finally she comes back and says, "the chicken is going to be around 20 minutes, he has a huge order right in front of you." And well oviously we didn't have 20 minutes, and we were mad because they didn't have any stupid chicken back there stupid Cubs. But then she said there might be some around the store like in the front. So my mom goes to another place, and I run to the front of the store, and I see the last two, two 8 piece packages, we wanted 16 so that worked perfectly. So I run and get it. Then we check out and my mom gets some dessert too to take out there. And then we drive and get there. We get there, and this is out in the middle of no where on the farm. I love it out there. We get there, and then we check out Aaron, my like 8 year old cousin, new moterized scotter. I had my cousin Jay on my sholders, so I couldn't ride it. But then we went inside and ate. And then we tormented the adults like we always do to either go driving or ride the gator. And they always say no. So we just keep bringing it up like every 2 minutes so they just get so annoyed that we get to drive it. Well they didn't budge, so we just went swimming in there inground pool. And then we went back and bugged them again, well they still wouldn't give it to us, so Michael had the idea of pushing it out so they would have to give it to us. So we do, and then both of our moms come out screaming at us lol. It was pretty funny, they were all mad and we were just laughing and I didn't know who to listen to because they were both contridictin themselves lol. It was pretty great. But then after that, we took a walk, and then it was time to go. Well me and my cousins always ask them to spend the night, and we always torment them and give them all this B.S. for them to finally let them let us. It took over a half an hour of negotiating, but we finally got it. My parents were gonna have my two cousins come home with them and Nate and spend the night at my house, and me and Michael were going to spend the night at Matt's house. So we finally got them talked into it, and my parents left, and then we went swimming again. After we went swimming, we got out and got ready to go over to Elmwood to go to the fireworks there. We got in the car, and then went and picked up my little cousin Jay and my other cousin Jed. So we went to the fireworks, and let me tell you, they were horrible. I am used to the Peoria one which is huge, and then I go to this little farm town that looks like a little kid is setting them off. They had huge breaks in between like every firework, and there was no more than 3 in the sky at one time. And this is how country this was, a train right in the middle of the show, came through and it was right in the middle of where everyone was sitting, we were behind the tracks of course so we lost about 2 minutes of the whole huge 10 minutes it was on. There were little kids right near the tracks to, and the train was going really fast for intown, so that was an accident just waiting to happen. But at the end of the show it was a joke, you are like "it's over?" There was no finalle at all. It just stopped, so we got back in the car, and my littlest cousin Annie, cried the whole way home. I have never heard that much constant noise before, it was crazy. But we got home, and we wanted to sleep outside because that's just what we wanted to do. So we get blankets and take them outside, and we were gonna sleep on the trampoline, but it was wet. And then I had this really cool idea, of one person sleeing on the fort, one sleeping on the other fort with your feet on the slide which wouldn't be that bad, and there was one tent out there that someone could sleep in. But Michael just thought that was a crazy idea, so we decided on the deck. Well we lay all our stuff down and use the pads of chairs for a materous which actually was comfortable. So I talk to Michael for awhile because Matt is already asleep, and in the middle of nowhere out there its freaky to be outside in the dark. You hear noises, but your in the middle of nowhere, so its wierd. But finally after an hour, we decided to go inside, not because we were scared, but because it got so damp outside. My pillow was soaked, and it felt horrible, so me and Mike woke Matt up and headed inside. We got into bed and then just feel alseep, then we woke up, and then went down and ate breakfast. Diana, my aunt is hilarious, she speaks her mind and its funny and very true. She tells Matt off all the time and we just laugh at him and its hilarious. We ate some hunnycombs and then we had lunch which was hotdogs. And then we went swimming becuase our hair was all over the place. And then Danny took us out and tried to teach us how to drive a stick shift on his truck. They say that if someone other than your parents teach you, it's much easier, and we think it was proven true when Danny was really helpful to us, and we a little different with Matt lol. Danny is really cool though. Well Michael wasn't that bad, but he already had his permit, so he didn't have to worry about the driving part just getting the gears just right. Well I had to get the gears just right and worry about driving. It's not the easiest thing in the world. I wasn't that bad at it though, the hardest part is just getting moving at the beginging without killing or like pealing out. I finally got it though after a lot of tries and once you get it, switching gears is pretty easy. But driving them is still very hard, that's why I'm never buying one. Matt kept killing it, but he is only 14 so we understood that. But after he took us all on the truck, we got in the Jeep he built himself and tried driving that stick shift. I liked the Jeep better because the stick wasn't spring loaded and you could feel where you were going easier I thought in the gears. We all drove that, and then we stopped and my mom was there by them. Then we got in the Gator and just drove around for awhile. We kicked Matt out which was pretty funny and then just kept going, and them I went to go see something and Mike drove away so he was the only one on it. So on the whole way we were all fighting to push people off. We never got our goal accomplished though. Mike and Matt, I'm still thirsty, we have to do that next time. It always never works out lol. But then after that we just talked for a little and then I went home with my mom and we took Michael home. After that, my mom had to stop at Kohels, so we went there and I just sat in the front of the store on those chair things, and then I came home and ate some taco salada my dad made and then started on my APS project, then we let off fireworks and then I just came back inside and just listend to musis. Wow, this is really long so I won't get into what I did today. I'll just write again tonight, because I'm hungry and am going to go get some food. Oh yeah, KLT, you are a wild girl lol. I still can't believe you have did that! I thought I would do something like that before you did lol. That's hilarious. Oh and Mike and Matt, you have to tell me soon about the concert for I can go buy the tickets. Matt lets see if you win a thousand dollars lol, I don't think you are going to be able to go, but if you do get to call me. And Mike I'm guessing you will, great idea about your dad going for my dad has something to do up there too. All those bands it's going to be crazy! Alright well time for food. I'll write about today tonight. Just becasue I'm tired of writing this long entrie. See-ya!

      Well I got up today at around 8:30, I don't know why, I just woke up then. I kinda just hung out for awhile and then I went up and made myself some breakfast. I had three pieces of french toast, and an omlet. Thats five eggs and lots of cheese and three pieces of bread and lots of surup. So my colestral is probably through the roof now. But oh well, it was good. After that, I finally got in the shower and took my shower and then got out and was ready by like 11:30. Then I ate lunch, which my dad made spaghetti which was good. After that I just kinda hung out downstairs and then my half cousins came over for a little and then they left, and I started on my project for APS that I'm never going to get done. I still have my term paper to write too. But after that, my dad took me and my brother to church at St. Vincint de Paul at 4:30 and then we went to Spiderman II at the Rave. I've been really wanting to see Spiderman II and go to the Rave so it was nice. The Rave was amazing, the arm-rests go up, the seats leen back, the seets are very nice, stadium seeting, a huge screen, and too top it all off for going to Spiderman II you get a free popcorn and soda. It's a nice theater, very worth it to go to. Spiderman II was good, it wasn't amazing like I thought it was going to be, but it was still a good movie. I had to keep going to get a drink though during the movie because I don't drink soda and the popcorn made me very thursty. There was a lot of people there too, Spiderman II was playing every half hour and our theater was crowded, so I'm guessing the other ones were too. After the movie, there was a line at our bathroom. I got in there early so I was one of the first ones, but I've never seen a line at a guys bathroom, but I have today. That's how crowded it was. After the movie, we went over to that new American store. We looked at the digital cameras because I want one, my dad said I could probably get one for Christmas, so that's good. Then we just looked around at other stuff and sat on the massage chairs, you have to love those. I could just sit in there all day on those. It was nice. But sadly it was raining outside, because we were gonna go watch the East Peoria fireworks but, they got postponed till Monday because of the rain. It's suppose to rain tomorrow to. That's not cool at all. I am going over to my cousins in my Brimfield around 1:00. So hopefully its not raining then, for I can ride the gator and stuff or jump on the trampoline or go swimming. After that I'm gonna try to go to Eureka with Amanda, Nat, Whitney, Kacy, Andrew, for the fireworks and a thing for Amanda and Andrew's church. But I don't know if I will be able to yet. Well I'm tired. See-ya! Have a happy 4th of July!

      My dog is barking like crazy because she is in her cage and no one is there to play with her. Well I hate to tell ya Grace but its 10:15 at night, everyone is tired and we already played with you, so shut up. Even though I'm going up to play with you after I write this, you are making me go nuts. Alright back to my day, after I had lunch I kinda just sat around and hung out all day. I went outside because it was nice out for a little. And then me and my family went to Ruby Tuesdays for dinner. Our waiter was really cool, I don't know why, he just seemed really cool, that's all I really noticed about that whole thing. I got a bacon cheese burger which was really good. My dad got a steak, my mom got this chicken thing and my brother has to always be difficult so he had to get shrimp. But when we were there, it was very crowded, and then it started to rain outside. But right went we went to the car, it stoped, so it was nice. And then I came home and really did nothing. I have kinda just been either sitting inside or going outside. I talked to my cousin, Michael, on the phone for about a half an hour, and then I talked to KLT for about an hour, and then Amanda and Natelie and Whitney for about a half an hour. And now I'm just bored. I'm thinking about starting my term paper, but I don't know. I'm not in the mood to do homework, but I have that and a project do, really soon. Its going to really suck to do, because I'm going to keep putting them both off I know it. But this is all I have left to do in this class, so it's not that bad. Only 9 more days of summer school. We have Monday off thankfully because CAT takes it off, so we follow because almost everyone's parents work there. My dad does, and I'm sure if you're reading this your mom or dad does also. It's that crazy. I hate this area, it's so perdicatable. The west coast looks very good. I'm trying to decide want I want to do for the rest of my life too. I'm still kinda on the lawyer thing. But there is something else that looks very appleasing, but a little harder to get into. But very simple, and I like that. So we'll just have to see. A lot of deep thoughts are coming out of me tonight. Oh! And this happend awhile ago, but I finally got something from Mcdonalds for calling them. I got a gift certifcate for a free large sandwhich. It's not much, but hey! It's saving me 3 bucks! Which I don't even have, I have one dollar in my wallet and that is the exent of my money. I'm broke and need a job horribly. But I'm not going to get one till next summer, so I'm going to be broke for a long time. And I'm getting my license in January, how I'm going to pay for the $2.00 gas, who knows. It's going to be crazy though, and I'm going to be stretching it really far. They put tennis on over Jay Leno, they are delaying Jay Leno for a half hour of tennis? It's just a recap to, I hate when they do this, they do it the whole time of the Olympics. Wow, I have nothing to do at all. I need to start that stupid term paper or the project, but that's not gonna happen. Well my dog finally stoped barking, after about 20 minutes of me writing this, she has finally stoped. Thank gosh. Well I'm going to stop this before I just keep rambling on. See-ya.

      Alright so on Wensday what did I do? I got up and went to school, it was the US Consitution Test day! Yippy! We got there, and we reviewed for a little, you have to love the review games we play. They are actually fun and entertaining. And then we were given time to study, and then there was two parts to the test which both had 50 questions each. Well, that was one of the easiest tests I have ever taken. I got a 100 on one of the tests and a 98 on the other. I was very happy, but then after school, I took Kyle home and then me and my sister went and picked up my brother at golf. While was getting him, I saw Tony and talked to him. Tony is an awesome kid, it was good to talk to him again. It brought back awesome memories of us hanging out at St. Pats. But then, I went home and I'm trying to remember what I did after that. Well, I ate oviously, and then my brother went to the pool, and my sister left for work. And then I just kinda hung out for awhile. Then Amanda, Natelie, Whiteny, and Kacy, and me hung out for about an hour. We stayed in someone else yard and on the sidewalk for some reason, and we played with the basketball. And then after that I had go home and eat. And then after that I really did nothing else I don't think. If I did I don't remember. But then I went to bed, and then got up on Thursday and went to school again. We reviewed for the IL Consitution Test, and then after school, I gave Ryn and Kyle a ride home, and then I had to go to the ortho because of my stupid bracket. I get all the way over there, and they are just like, "we arn't going to put it back on, you don't need it." So they just cut my wire and I left. Pointless, but then we got home. And my mom went and go food from Taco Bell which was good. And then after that I called KLT and then went to her house and then we walked up to Hollands, I bought a nasty grape shaved ice, it was sick. But then we walked back to Kristen's and just sat on her portch, or however it's spelled, and I stayed there for about an hour and a half. And then I rode home and then got online, and then I was riding to Kyles, but then Bree came out of the pool, and I stopped and talked and we ended up talking for over an hour and a half. It was a great converstion, we both said we had no lives and we are gonna hang out now since we have no lives. It should be fun, but then after that I went back home, and then got back online to tell Kyle I was finally coming over. So I rode over to Kyles and we went down stairs for awhile and then went outside. We stayed outside for a long time, and then about an hour and a half later I had to go, so I rode home. And then I ate, and then me and Kyle decided we were bored so we went to the swim meet. Stayed there for about 2 minutes because no one was there, and then we just walked back to my house. And then Amanda, Natelie, and Whitney came over and we talked for awhile, and then Kyle had to leave, and then the girls did to a little after. Then my mom left to go pick up my dad at the airport because he came home last night from his buisness trip. Then I came inside and got online and just listend to music. At around 11:00 I was jsut listening to music singing it because that's what I do, and then I decided it was time to stop and go get ready for bed, and I still hadn't studyed yet. So I got ready for bed, and then just read over my review sheet once. And then went to bed. Then I got up today and oviously went to school again, my dad took me, because he is home now like I just said, I told him to buy a lottery ticket because the Jackpot is over 290 Million. And that is just a crazy load of money which would be very nice to have, even Matt Lauer from the Today show bought over 400, he is a smart, but rich already, guy. But then my dad took me to school and I sat outside talking for a little, and then we went inside and we played another game to review for our IL Consitution Test, then he gave us time to study, and then we took the test. Again, a pretty easy test, after the test he gave us a ten minute break and we went outside like we always do and sat on the steps in the sun. Then we went back in and since the test was Scantron he had them graded and gave us our grade. I got a 100 on it so it was nice. And then after that, we watched this video. It was interesting at that lol. It was about Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court appointment and the sexual harassment that he was accused of. Well the lady who accused his said he said some pretty colorful words. She said that he said that he loved to watch porn of girls doing it with animals, and he would talk about his penis as "long dong silver" and many other worse things were said in that video. It was a very interesting video to be watching at school. But it was interesting about the case. Before we left for the day we talked about it and decided on who was lieing and who wasn't. Some think that the girl was and some others believed that Thomas was. But we haven't finished the video yet so I don't know who is yet. Thomas oviously won because he is on the Supreme Court now, but its a very interesting video. The sentors just yell and are wierd some times lol. It's interesting. But then after that my dad picked me up and I went home, and then we went to the bank, and then my dad took me and my brother and we bought some fireworks down in East Peoria at the place with the big roaster which is the coolest thing in the world, and then we came home and had lunch. And now I'm bored. So if anyone wants to do anything the rest of the day, I'm up for it. I haven't seen Spiderman 2 yet and really want to so if you want to go see that, I would love it :-D, but if you want to do something else to that's alright. I'm just sick of sitting at my house. Well I'm going to go outside before it starts raining and I am going to play some basketball. Have a great day. See-ya.
