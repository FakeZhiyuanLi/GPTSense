        When I was two years old, I went on a train trip. I know I was two because my Mom had just had my little sister and she is just over two years younger than I am. My older sister also accompanied us, she would have been six. I don’t remember a lot about the trip except that I had a lot of fun playing on the seats. They faced each other and I could lean and bounce onto one and then turn around and bounce on the other. I remember other passengers giving my Mom a few “oh, how cute” statements when we got on the train, and then being a little annoyed at our exuberance a few hours later. I giggled a lot and my youngest sister cried sometimes. It wasn’t until I was forty years old that mention of the trip ever even came up again. My Mom asked me if I had ever been on a train. I said just the once with her when I was really little. She didn’t remember a train trip. I gave her all the details I could remember and she thought I had dreamed it all up because she had never taken us on a train. A few days later I asked my Dad if Mom had ever taken us three girls on a train anywhere. “Yes”, he said. “Right after your sister was born your Grandmother had a heart attack.” Grandma lived 12 hours away and Mom needed to be there. Since my Dad couldn’t get off work on such short notice, and Mom couldn’t drive, just having had the baby, he put us on a train then met up with us a few days later. Even this did not really shake my Mom’s memory but that’s OK, I ‘m sure traveling for hours with three little girls is not something most people would want to remember.  My parents have always been a little bewildered at the things I remember from my childhood, but have never made a big issue of it. They usually chalk it off to me repeating stories I have been told or remembering a picture instead of the event, but after I fill in the details, there is no denying, I remember a lot of things about my early childhood.  Before my mom even had my little sister, I was hospitalized with a severe bladder/kidney infection. I remember going into the emergency room and four to six people holding me down to catheterize me. I remember the rough green wool pad that they had under my bottom as I lay there screaming, humiliated that all these people were looking at my naked body. I remember they later put a net over my crib because I kept climbing out. I remember them coming in every morning to take my temperature. I remember there were quite a few other cribs in the hospital room and that mine was the second one on the left when you came in the door. I remember my mom getting furious over the fact that they had put a diaper on me after she had already potty trained me. She was expecting another one soon and she didn’t want two in diapers at the same time!  There is a psychological test that is used sometimes. The question is. “What is your earliest memory?” It is always fascinating to see people go through their minds and search for details. It is also fascinating to see how much of an impact that memory has had on their entire life. For instance, my brother’s earliest memory is being on a little plastic motor cycle that you push with your feet, only he is speeding down a hill fast and out of control before he crashes big time at the bottom. The need for speed is a huge factor in his life.  My earliest memory is of waking up in my body after I was born. I know, I know, everyone says “No, way”, but I really do remember. I woke up and I was laying on my right side, wrapped up snug; my crib was on the back right side of a room. I could see a red brick wall outside the window. The window had a black metal grate over it. My first thoughts were, “Wow, it is so cold and tight here”. I remember this very vividly. I was so tiny compared to the crib and compared to how I was previously. It is this memory, this awakening, that allows me to know for sure, that a human soul does not enter a body until it is born. How do I know? I remember. We all have this memory; we have just chosen to forget it.  I have a cousin that molested a two year old girl when he was 14. When he was about 21 he got a 14 year old girl pregnant. He married her and they had a son. She quickly learned the true nature of her new husband and bolted pretty fast after the baby was born. I don’t know if she was pregnant when she left or if that came later, but it wasn’t long before she found herself expecting again. She went to what my mom described as “a back room butcher”. Abortions were not legal in 1970. She died the next morning. She bled to death at the age of 16. Her son was awarded a million dollar settlement that he received when he was 18. They were able to put a dollar figure on her life.  These two pieces of information have been woven together in my mind and in my very being. In a perfect world every child would be a wanted child. In a perfect world all children would be taken care of; they would have enough food to eat, a roof over their heads, cloths to wear, clean water to drink, a decent school to go to, and at least one person to love and care for them. That would be a perfect world. Until we, as a society, can provide those things for every child that is already born, then we have no right to force little girls to have children that they can not provide for. There is a bottom line when it comes to the quality of life. There is a point where you would be better off not being born than being forced to live under the conditions that a majority of our world’s population currently live under. We can do better; and when we figure out how to provide a dignified life for all of the people who are on our planet right now, then we can worry about some little girl needing to have some cells scraped out of her body, so she can have a chance at a life that is not filled with strife.
