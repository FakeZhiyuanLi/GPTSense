      Today I got up around 10:00 after sleeping in for the first time.&nbsp; Boy did that feel good.&nbsp; Then I hung around all day doing nothing, but playing games on the computer and talking ot friends, before leaving to go to the RSS Grand Rapids, Marine Corps station and working out and running.&nbsp; We actually played a soccer game.&nbsp; However, I hurt my SSGT Palmer in the last minute of the game.&nbsp; I felt really bad.&nbsp; He could have fractured his bone below his knee cap.&nbsp; Yikes!!&nbsp; I didn't mean to do it and he knows that and he tells me not to feel sorry, but I do and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I'm sorry SSGT Plamer.&nbsp; Please for give me.&nbsp; For now I have nothing more to say....but I'll write more later.  ---Gyzmo

      So yesterday I arrived at Fort Custer, Battle Creek, Michigan around 5:30 Pm&nbsp;and experiance some tought drills, and training.&nbsp; I thought it was fun though.&nbsp; Then around 8:00 we headed into the mess hall for chow and we had our first meal and lesson about chow time.&nbsp; Then we headed back to the&nbsp;barracks for tivoli.&nbsp; Then we hit the dubbies and the head, and lastly the racks, after a debriefing about Fire watch for each of the 21 females from 4 different RSS platoons in Mchigan.&nbsp; Then it bagan.&nbsp; Fire watch and I had the first duty.&nbsp; That was quiet interesting.&nbsp; Then the next day revoli was at 5:30 am and it was off to the guys barracks and then the Chow hall for some morning chow.&nbsp; And man did we PT a lot because our guidon had been stolen in the guys barracks, because they sucked a fire watch.&nbsp; Anyways, then we had more PT-ing, IT-ing, and field day stuff, and games in the boondocks and classes about Marine Corps basic knowledge and history.&nbsp; It was fun, and I was tired though and I lost my voice.&nbsp; It was hard that night to do fire watch.  But I'll tell you more on this later when I get the time to write, for now though I have to go.&nbsp; Bye!  ---Gyzmo

      He's alive.....I'll tell ya the story later!!!!!!  Thank God for Pat.  Sorry God, I never meant to be mean and say that I hated you.....I was just angry but I bet you already new that, because you have my whole life already planned out.  Thanks God for bringing Pat back to our lives.  And I'd like to pray for Nick who was also in the car accident and did die.  Please God be with his family.  And I pray that his soul would be at rest.  He was my special project and I did my best to preach the word of God to him, in every way. And I pray that Pat will come from his surgery and all will be alright.  ---Gyzmo

      Hey, so today sucks even more, because today is Pat's visitations at his funeral.  That's right a funneral for a seventeen-year old.  God, I'm so upset, confused, and sad by this whole thing.  I don't even know what to say or think right now.  It's not fair!  Where's God?????  Where the heck is God at a time like this and how could he let something like this happen?  Well, you could say that God wanted him home and that's why he had to die, well there's been some times when I've wanted things and I haven't gotten them.  Why should God!?!?!  I hate God! I hate him!!!!

      So today was ok.  This morning I got up and went to church and our pastor Michael Spitters talked about "letting things go"...(like things from the past, or things that you don't wan tanyone to know about) and it hit me really hard.  I will write more about this later though.  Like tommorrow.  Oh and then I went water tubing, sea-doing and swimming at Green Lake at my friend's cottage.  And then I got to talk to Ben!!!  yeah!!!.....but I still miss LCPL.  =*(   Anyways though....I have to go right now but I'll type more tomorrow because I'm like four days behind.  Geez...I'm so busy!  Bye!!!!  =D  ---Gyzmo

      Today was very intresting, because I didn't do anything. All I did was play around, at the "Y" where friends could be found. I just "hung out" that's all I did, and and made new friends with younger kids. But when the time came to close, I started home and took a doze. And now that it is getting late, I'll go to my room and sit and wait. I'll read a book or think awhile, and then I'll close my eyes until tomorrow. And who know's what tomorrow will bring, because everyday there's a new something. So that's my poem about today, and that's really all I have to say.  ---Gyzmo

      Hey, this site was created today for anyone, anywhere, to read and just get a grip on what a teenager might have to say about life. Many teens might have thoughts or questions about life, (I know I do) and they might not know how to express them. This is just merely my way of expressing what's running through my mind, as I go about day to day.  Each and everyday, notes will be posted relating to that day; and all past notes can be found in the archives below. Simply click on the archive button of the month that you want, and search for the day of notes that you'd like to read.  Also, feel free to express your thoughts, comments, or questions on this site, through the area labeled "Comments". Please remember that your comments will be made visible to all who access this website (the public); and that any derogatory terms, or inappropriate language (including that which may offend others) will be deleted. Thanks and enjoy!  ---Gyzmo
