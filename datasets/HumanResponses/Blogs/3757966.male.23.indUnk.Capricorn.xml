      Just a thought for the National Anthem! How well do you know about it? I have always wondered who is the "adhinayak" and "bharat bhagya vidhata", whose praise we are singing. I thought might be Motherland India! Our current National Anthem "Jana Gana Mana" is sung throughout the country. Did you know the following about our national anthem, I didn't.  To begin with, India's national anthem, Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka, was written by Rabindranath Tagore in honour of King George V and the Queen of England when they visited India in 1919. To honour their visit Pandit Motilal Nehru had the five stanzas included, which are in praise of the King and Queen. (And most of us think it is in the praise of our great motherland!!!)  In the original Bengali verses only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. Punjab, Sindh, Gujarat, Maratha etc. were mentioned. None of the princely states were recognized which are integral parts of India now Kashmir, Rajasthan, Andhra, Mysore or Kerala. Neither the Indian Ocean nor the Arabian Sea was included, since they were directly under Portuguese rule at that time. The Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka implies that King George V is the lord of the masses and Bharata Bhagya Vidhata is "the bestower of good fortune".  Following is a translation of the five stanzas that glorify the King:  First stanza: (Indian) People wake up remembering your good name and ask for your blessings and they sing your glories. (Tava shubha naame jaage; tava shubha aashish maage, gaaye tava jaya gaatha)  Second stanza: Around your throne people of all religions come and give their love and anxiously wait to hear your kind words.  Third stanza: Praise to the King for being the charioteer, for leading the ancient travellers beyond misery.  Fourth stanza: Drowned in the deep ignorance and suffering, poverty-stricken, unconscious country? Waiting for the wink of your eye and your mother's (the Queen's) true protection.  Fifth stanza: In your compassionate plans, the sleeping Bharat (India) will wake up. We bow down to your feet O' Queen, and glory to Rajeshwara (the King).  This whole poem does not indicate any love for the Motherland, but depicts a bleak picture. When you sing Jana Gana Mana Adhinayaka, whom are you glorifying? Certainly not the Motherland. Is it God? The poem does not indicate that. It is time now to understand the original purpose and the implication of this, rather than blindly sing as has been done for more than past fifty years.  Nehru chose the present national anthem as opposed to Vande Mataram because he thought that it would be easier for the band to play!!! It was an absurd reason but today for that matter bands have advanced and they can very well play any music. So they can as well play Vande Mataram, which is a far better composition in praise of our dear Motherland -India. Wake up, it's high time!  Shouldn't Vande Mataram be our National Anthem?

      About 10 years ago, I started a job as a trainer for a Telemarketing agency.  In one of my first classes the head trainer told a very motivating story that I would like to share with you.  He began by drawing a diagram of a stick man standing in the middle of a circle. To make it more interesting, he drew things like a house, a car, and a few friends inside the circle.  He asked the question "Can anyone tell me what this is?" In a long silence, one guy decided to throw out "the world?" The trainer said "That's close, this is your Comfort Zone. Inside your circle you have all the things that are important to you. Your home, your family, your friends, and your job. People feel that inside this circle they are safe from any danger or conflict.  "Can anyone tell me what happens when you step out of this circle?" A strong silence came over the room. The same eager guy abruptly announced "You are afraid". Another guy said "You make mistakes". The silence continued and the trainer smiled and said "When you make mistakes what can the result be?"  The first guy shouts "You learn something."  "Exactly, you are learning." The trainer turned to the board and drew an arrow pointing from the stick man directly to the outside of the circle. He proceeded to say "When you leave your Comfort Zone you put yourself out there, in front of the world to be in a situations that you are not comfortable with. The end result is that you have learned something that you did not already know, you expand your knowledge to become a better person."  He turned again to the board and drew a bigger circle around the original circle, and added a few new things like more friends, a bigger house etc.  "The moral of the story is that if you stay inside your Comfort Zone you will never be able to expand your horizons and learn. When you step out of your Comfort Zone you will eventually make your circle bigger, to challenge your mind and grow to be stronger, and all in all a better person."

      Deccan Herald : An angry letter from a young lady made JRD Tata  change his rule  Sudha Murthy was livid when a job advertisement posted by a Tata  company at the institution where she was completing her post  graduation stated that " Lady candidates need not apply" . She  dashed off a post card to JRD Tata, protesting against the  discrimination. Following this, Mrs Murthy was called for an  interview and she became the first female engineer to work on the  shop floor at Telco (now Tata Motors). It was the beginning of an  association that would change her life in more ways than one.  THERE are two photographs that hang on my office wall. Everyday when  I enter my office I look at them before starting my day. They are  pictures of two old people. One is of a gentleman in a blue suit and  the other is a black and white image of a man with dreamy eyes and a  white beard.  People have often asked me if the people in the photographs are  related to me. Some have even asked me,  " Is this black and white  photo that of a Sufi saint or a religious Guru ? " I smile and  reply  No, nor are they related to me. These people made an impact  on my life. I am grateful to them. Who are they ? The man in the  blue suit is Bharat Ratna JRD Tata and the black and white photo is of Jamsetji Tata.  But why do you have them in your office ? You can call it gratitude.  Then, invariably, I have to tell the person the following story. It  was a long time ago. I was young and bright, bold and idealistic. I  was in the final year of my Master's course in Computer Science at  the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, then known as  the Tata Institute.  Life was full of fun and joy. I did not know what helplessness or  injustice meant.  It was probably the April of 1974. Bangalore was getting warm and  gulmohars were blooming at the IISc campus. I was the only girl in  my postgraduate department and was staying at the ladies'  hostel.  Other girls were pursuing research in different departments of  Science. I was looking forward to going abroad to complete a  doctorate in computer  science.  I had been offered scholarships from Universities in the US. I had  not thought of taking up a job in India.  One day, while on the way to my hostel from our lecture-hall  complex, I saw an advertisement on the notice board. It was a  standard job-requirement notice from the famous automobile company  Telco (now Tata Motors). It stated that the company required young,  bright engineers, hardworking and with an excellent academic  background, etc.  At the bottom was a small line: "Lady candidates need not apply." I read it and was very upset. For the first time in my life I was up  against gender discrimination.  Though I was not keen on taking up the job, I saw it as a challenge.  I had done extremely well in academics, better than most of my male  peers. Little did I know then that in real life academic excellence  is not enough to be successful.  After reading the notice I went fuming to my room. I decided to  inform the topmost person in Telco's management about the injustice  the company was perpetrating. I got a postcard and started to write,  but there was a problem: I did not know who headed Telco. I thought  it must be one of the Tatas. I knew JRD Tata was the head of the  Tata Group; I had seen his pictures in newspapers (actually, Sumant  Moolgaokar was the company' s chairman then).  I took the card, addressed it to JRD and started writing. To this  day I remember clearly what I wrote. " The great Tatas have always  been pioneers. They are the people who started the basic  infrastructure industries in India, such as iron and steel,  chemicals, textiles and locomotives. They have cared for higher  education in India, such as  iron and steel, chemicals, textiles and locomotives. They have cared  for higher education in India since 1900 and they were responsible for the  establishment of the Indian Institute of Science. Fortunately, I  study there. But I am surprised how a company such as Telco is  discriminating  on the basis of gender."  I posted the letter and forgot about it. Less than 10 days later, I  received a telegram stating that I had to appear for an interview at  Telco' s Pune facility at the company's expense. I was taken aback  by the telegram. My hostel mated told me I should use the  opportunity to go to Pune free of cost and buy them the famous Pune  saris for cheap! I collected Rs 30 each from everyone who wanted a  sari. When I look back, I feel like  laughing at the reasons for my going, but back then they seemed good  enough to  make the trip.  It was my first visit to Pune and I immediately fell in love with  the city. To this day it remains dear to me. I feel as much at home  in Pune as I do in Hubli, my hometown. The place changed my life in  so many ways.  As directed, I went to Telco 's Pimpri office for the interview.  There were six people on the panel and I realised then that this was  serious business. "This is the girl who wrote to JRD,"  I heard  somebody whisper as soon as I entered the room. By then I knew for  sure that I would not get the job. The realisation abolished all  fear from my mind, so I was rather cool while the interview was being conducted.  Even before the interview started, I reckoned the panel was biased,  so I told them, rather impolitely, "I hope this is only a technical  interview."They were taken aback by my rudeness, and even today I am  ashamed about my attitude.  The panel asked me technical questions and I answered all of them.  Then an elderly gentleman with an affectionate voice told me, " Do  you know why we said lady candidates need not apply? The reason is  that we have never employed any ladies on the shop floor. This is  not a co-ed college; this is a factory. When it comes to academics,  you are a first ranker throughout. We appreciate that, but people  like you should work in research laboratories. " I was a young girl  from small-town Hubli. My world had been a limited place. I did not  know the ways of large corporate houses and their difficulties, so I  answered, " But you must start somewhere, otherwise no woman will  ever be able to work in your factories."  Finally, after a long interview, I was told I had been successful.  So this was what the future had in store for me. Never had I thought  I would take up a job in Pune. I met a shy young man from Karnataka  there, we became good friends and we got married.  It was only after joining Telco that I realised who JRD was: the  uncrowned king of Indian industry. Now I was scared, but I did not  get to meet him till I was transferred to Bombay. One day I had to  show some reports to Mr Moolgaokar, our chairman, who we all knew as  SM. I was in his office on the first floor of Bombay House (the Tata  headquarters) when, suddenly JRD walked in. That was the first time  I saw "appro JRD ". Appro means " our"  in Gujarati. This was the  affectionate term by which people at Bombay House called him.  I was feeling very nervous, remembering my postcard episode. SM   introduced me nicely, "Jeh (that's what his close associates called  him), this young woman is an engineer and that too a postgraduate.  She is the first woman to work on the Telco shop floor."JRD looked  at me. I was praying he would not ask me any questions about my  interview (or the postcard that preceded it). Thankfully, he didn't.  Instead, he remarked.  "It is nice that girls are getting into engineering in our country.  By the way, what is your name?"  When I joined Telco I was Sudha  Kulkarni, Sir, " I replied. "Now I am Sudha Murthy." He smiled and  kindly smile and started a discussion with SM. As for me, I almost  ran out of the room.  After that I used to see JRD on and off. He was the Tata Group  chairman and I was merely an engineer. There was nothing that we had  in common. I was in awe of him. One day I was waiting for Murthy, my husband, to pick me up after  office hours. To my surprise I saw JRD standing next to me. I did  not know how to react. Yet again I started worrying about that  postcard. Looking back, I realise JRD had forgotten about it. It  must have been a small incident for him, but not so for me.  "Young lady, why are you here ?"he asked" Office time is over. "I said, " Sir, I'm waiting for my husband to come and pick me up."  JRD said, " It is getting dark and there's no one in the corridor.  I'll wait with you till your husband comes. "I was quite used to  waiting for Murthy, but having JRD waiting alongside made me extremely uncomfortable. I was nervous. Out of the corner of my eye I looked at him. He wore  a simple white pant and shirt. He was old, yet his face was glowing.  There asn't any air of superiority about him. I was thinking, " Look  at this person. He is a chairman, a well-respected man in our  country and he is waiting for the sake of an ordinary employee."  Then I saw Murthy and I rushed out. JRD called and said, " Young  lady, tell your husband never to make his wife wait again."  In 1982 I had to resign from my job at Telco. I was reluctant to go,  but I really did not have a choice. I was coming down the steps of  Bombay House after wrapping up my final settlement when I saw JRD  coming up. He was absorbed in thought. I wanted to say goodbye to  him, so I stopped. He saw me and paused.  Gently, he said, " So what are you doing, Mrs Kulkarni?" (That was  the way he always addressed me.)"Sir, I am leaving Telco." Where are  you going?" he asked. " Pune, Sir. My husband is starting a company  called Infosys and I'm shifting to Pune..." " Oh!  And what will you do when you are successful." " Sir, I don' t  know  whether we will be successful." " Never start with diffidence, " the  advised me. "Always start with confidence. When you are successful  you must give back to society. Society gives us so much; we must  reciprocate. I wish you all the best."  Then JRD continued walking up the stairs. I stood there for what  seemed like a millennium. That was the last time I saw him alive.   Many years later I met Ratan Tata in the same Bombay House,  occupying the chair JRD once did. I told him of my many sweet memories of working  with Telco. Later, he wrote to me, " It was nice hearing about Jeh from you. The  sad part is that he' s not alive to see you today."  I consider JRD a great man because, despite being an extremely busy  person, he valued one postcard written by a young girl seeking  justice. He must have received thousands of letters everyday. He  could have thrown  mine away, but he didn't do that. He respected  the intentions of that unknown girl, who had neither influence nor  money, and gave her an opportunity in his company. He did not merely  give her a job; he changed her life and mindset forever.  Close to 50 per cent of the students in today's engineering colleges  are girls. And there are women on the shop floor in many industry  segments.  I see these changes and I think of JRD. If at all time stops and  asks me what I want from life, I would say I wish JRD were alive  today to see how the company we started has grown. He would have  enjoyed it  wholeheartedly.  My love and respect for the House of Tata remains undiminished by  the passage of time. I always looked up to JRD. I saw him as a role  model for his simplicity, his generosity, his kindness and the care  he took of his employees. Those blue eyes always reminded me of the  sky; they had the same vastness and magnificence.  Sudha Murthy is a widely published writer and chairperson of the  Infosys Foundation involved in a number of social development  initiatives. Infosys chairman Narayan Murthy is her husband. __________________________________________________________ Article sourced from: Lasting Legacies (Tata Review- Special  Commemorative Issue 2004), brought out by the house of Tatas to commemorate the  100th birth anniversary of JRD Tata on July 29, 2004.
