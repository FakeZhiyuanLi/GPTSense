      In an earlier post I said that I suspected Swiss ref Urs Meier would get a few e-mails via his web site after his controversial decision. Well he did - 16,000 of them:  urlLink BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Referee under police protection   The e-mails include death threats. After the World Cup in 1998, it was Beckham getting death threats for his sending off against the Argies. It seems the English are not happy unless we have someone to threaten with death after we lose at football. How sad.  This is why I don't really like football (the so-called "beautiful game").

      I did warn you:  urlLink BBC SPORT | Tennis | Henman crashes out   To recap on this summer of sport so far:  Soccer: Insipid England crash out of quarter finals Rugby Union: Limp England lose 4 Tests in a row Tennis: 'Pussycat' Tim Henman crashes out of quarter finals Cricket: England officially shocking at one-day cricket (though we are unbeaten in 7 matches in Test cricket)  No wonder the English love to support underdogs at sports...  I'm at a loose end now. Is there an English tiddlywinks player I can go and cheer for?

      What did I say about England not being totally rubbish at cricket? They now appear to be competing with the football and rugby players to see who can be most arse-clenchingly bad!   urlLink 4th Match: England v New Zealand at Chester-le-Street, 29 Jun 2004   And to add insult to injury, two the players had all their stuff nicked from the dressing room while practicing for their rout - for some reason, Darren Gough possessed 17 credit cards...   urlLink Vaughan and Gough robbed

      England are out of Euro 2004, largely thanks to this bloke:  urlLink Urs Meier | Swiss Referee . I suspect that one or two disgruntled people might be filling in his feedback form with some less that complimentary messages! He is currently the proud owner of a beard that makes him look a bit like Richard Branson (not shown in pics), according to my girlfriend - apparently this says a lot about his trustworthiness!  The English summer of sporting disappointment will no doubt continue with another lacklustre performance from 'Tiger' Tim Henman at Wimbledon ("come on Tim"), and England's Rugby Union team getting murdered by the Aussies. Oh well, at least our cricketers aren't totally rubbish at the moment, which is all that matters to me :-)

      The title of this blog is of course a homage to  urlLink Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American  by Michael Moore, which I recently finished. It's very entertaining if a bit disjointed, although US politics has moved on a bit since it was written. I am looking forward to seeing Farenheit 9/11 when it opens in the UK, which I believe is in July.

      I thought it was time to give blogging a go - it's perhaps not very important whether anyone reads it or not, but maybe an outlet for my thoughts could be useful. I have never tried keeping a diary, so I might not be up to much, but here goes!

      The last gig I went to was  urlLink Sonny Rollins . It was cool to be able to see a major jazz musician who has been active since the 50s and who has played with all-time greats like Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. My favourite two tracks were his two Calypso-tinged originals, Don't Stop The Carnival and St Thomas, but I enjoyed it all very much.

      Went to see  urlLink Bill Bailey  at Ipswich Regent on Saturday - hilarious. I laughed so much my head hurt!  Highlights included a rendition of the Hokey Cokey in the style of Kraftwerk ('Das Hokey Cokey'), 'Zippedy Doo Dah' as an alternative national anthem (as it would be performed by Portishead), some brilliiant original comedy songs and lots of rambling stand-up inspired by all kinds of weirdness - swimming with dolphins, ways to cook cannabis and his unique approach to vegetarianism ("well a duck's almost a fish").  Highly recommended if you get a chance to see him (and I think there is a DVD of the tour coming out later in the year).
