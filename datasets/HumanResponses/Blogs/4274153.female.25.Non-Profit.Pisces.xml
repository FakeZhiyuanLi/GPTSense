      Happy Birthday Aunt. Mom says it isn't going to be very happy since you have a houseful of kids and it is raining out so they'll have to stay inside. Hope you survive. Oh and say Hi to Milo. OK Piddlepup too, but tell her not to try and lick me.  Mom said she ran my name in a generator thingy and it said I was infected by this:      Doctor Unheimlich  has diagnosed me with  Mrs. Kitty's Syndrome      Cause :  running too fast     Symptoms :  French accent, swearing, extreme absenteeism, extreme warts     Cure :  exercise     Enter your name, for your own diagnosis:         Does that mean I can't eat anymore ladybugs? Or maybe it means I could do a duet with French announcer guy, whaddya think?

       I was traumatized today.      It was horrible.       Mom let me outside to play. I was having a grand old time. I teased the hamsters in their cage. The little balls of fluff just hate it when I paw the bars. They puff up and jab at me. Little buggers have a heck of a bite when the catch ya though.      When that got boring I spent a little time hunting bugs, though I have be careful to stay away from the rock garden and the flowers that attract the best bugs.      After my belly was full I started my rounds and was on the far side of the house when I was suddenly soaked. Rain came out of nowhere and I just got drenched. I had to sit and cry at the back door screen for five whole minutes before mom let me in so I could dry off in my bed.      I am still a little damp. I am not sure I will recover anytime soon.      I heard mom say that it is supposed to rain all week. I think I will stay inside, no matter how much I crave a good crunchy bug.

      Mom has really irritated me all day. She won't stay away from here computer long enough to pet me but 5 or 6 times. She forgot to put ice in my water bowl and then yelled at me when I tried to lick the ice in her cup. She forgot to leave the TV on when she left earlier so I had nothing to watch while she was gone.  And what really got my tail in a knot? Well Mom and Grandma sat here and watched some make fun of cats show right in front of me. As if I wasn't even in the room. I mean geez what do they think, I don't have feelings?  I think I will knead her arm extra hard tonight.  Meow!
