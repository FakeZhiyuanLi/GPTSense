      you must be dumb if you read this first sentence. BEOTCH. did whats with people calling things gay like this games gay. How the hell is the Game gay, its not like it can screw another game. people are really really stupid. someone once asked me (nathon) if i could do anything today and i said i had to go to billings with my mom and when i got back like at 2p.m. he called 2 hours later letting the phone ring for almost 3 minutes. What a crazy nut case that kid needs to get somone else to do something with besides me. Telling me his problems constaly he gives a person no room to have peace. he has problems about obsessions with too many people and gives them the stupidest nicknames like poptart....  WHAT AN IDIOT. he has nothing to do he needs something to do. I have a liking for nathon but hes the biggest pest you'll ever meet. if you hate people like that dont talk to him. my dad once said nathon just walked in our house without knocking or anything. What the hell was he thinking. he always wants food at peoples house. ya a drink there and here wouldn't mine, but he seems like heres been here a month in one day.     gonna get interview at the end of the month at Dj's to wash dishes nathon said. if your reading beyond this point your thinking to your self what a stupid idiot and you know what thats right.  people never listen to much intrumental music these days good intrumetal artists Joe Satriani Steve Vai ynqwie malsteen jhon prutucci and classical music.. yes i like classical   KNOCK KNOCK WHOS THERE.  only time only time time.  now im here thinking if i should go get insurance or buy a new guitar so many decisons.  geroge bush cant spell potato unless that was a different president or canidate but what the hell i dont trust bush nor kerry . keryy voted agaist body armor for our troops bush killed nearly 900 soilders. kerry looks like a zombie. bush is a monkey. where is this country going to. also arnold as california's Gov. people are trying top change the laws so arnie can run for president what the hell. too much to do and say in this country untill november 4th and see what happens. they should change the voting to popular not electetorial. gore would of won 4 years ago but damn florida and jeb bush . as we know it were gonna go down the tubes America is........................................................................................

      seems so so that school will be starting andi will be a Spohmore in high school. only seems like yesterday when i entered high school and picked my scedule. soon i will be a junior than a senior than out of high school. where will i be, playing guitar, i hop that comes true. Maybe i will be doing other stuff like fixing computers. Hell i dont know where i will be yet. My dad always asks me what i wanna be and i say i dont know bcause im so shy to everyone not to talk, but i really wanna start a band even if we dont go far. i was inspired by music by my dad when i was little, but didnt take much into consideration till 7th grade. i played string bass in band, but no one could hear me or care. kyle stembaugh also played and he couldnt read music hahahah. He always asked me to tab it out for him and i told him to go learn sheet music and he didnt really answer me when i tol him to.  Today huh well went to Steve Blairs B-day and went around and around. His parents to wal-mart to change there lube then we headed to the golden corral to eat, but they changed their mind because it was seafood and steak so we walked all the way to Dos Machos. that was a good place they give you tortillas and dip as a apetizer. as we were eating were talking about movies and crap. one of the waitress asked if it was somones birthday and she would bring the mexican band to sing happy birthday but were so unpatient we left and steves mom said that they brought some icecream but oh well. then we went to toys R us then to big bear then we went to the movie gallery to rent video games for the xbox we rented red dead revolver and mortal combat deadly alliance.    THE GAMES SUCK.       but we played halo   . me and steve jammed out on guitars. his parents limit him 3 hrs a day well that sucks. they should let him play a lot, hell you never know that he might become a guitar legend and i might be at his side...or not.     then travis controller for xbox was going wacko the left trigger didnt work. steves mom insisted she wanted to buy travis a new controller and he said no , and she insisted yes. blah blah blah blah more or more yes and no from each of them. then they dropped me off. i ate a cheeseburger and fried my mom made, shes a good mom. watched the phantom mennace for a little bit probaly 3/4 of it. then played guitar now im here bored as hell im only doing this blog so i can reflect in some years what i did and hope i want to do  bye for now
