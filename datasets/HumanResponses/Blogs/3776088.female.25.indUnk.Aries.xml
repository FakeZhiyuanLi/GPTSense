      I'm sure we've all heard the statement: "I just don't understand where little Johnny gets all of his energy from!".  Well, I can explain it to you very simply, as told by grcmnky to me.  We are all born into this world with the same amount of energy, only children have smaller bodies which require less energy to maintain them.  Thus, they have all that much more to burn.  As for older folks; the older you get, more energy is required to maintain your body and keep it running.  Therefore; adults seem to have less energy than children, when, in fact, we all have the same amount.  It's all relative.

      As I've gone through the years as a parent, I have come to realize that many parents are germaphobes.  That is all good and fine, to an extent.  Keeping a child from touching things like raw eggs, raw meat, and dead animals makes a lot of sense to me.  However, freaking out if little Johnny touches a grocery cart that hasn't been cleaned; plays in the mud; sticks his binky or sippy cup back in his mouth after it hit the floor; chews on the neighbors dog; plays around children who have a cold; or doesn't wash his hands every thirty minutes, well that just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Yes, I recognize that being clean has it's good points, but there is a such thing as being too clean.    I know we don't want our children to get sick or injured, but I feel that protecting little Johnny from everything in the world is actually more detrimental than letting the child be.  Our bodies need to be exposed to germs and bacteria in order to learn how to fight them off.  Often times an illness will be harder on someone who catches it for the first time at an older age than if they had been exposed to it at a younger age.  I would rather my children have a tough and strong immune system than to be knocked down by the simplest thing.  The best way to build up a strong immune system is by allowing exposure to minor things here and there.  My mother has a friend who would freak out in his daughters first two years of life if anyone was around her who had a cold.  Her immune system stinks because of that.  My husband, on the other hand, has been exposed to a lot of nasty things in his life and he's hardly ever sick.  My way of thinking has made people raise an eyebrow or two to me when we're out and about.  Just a few weeks ago Mugwump dropped her sippy cup in a restaurant.  It didn't land on its spout or anything like that.  The waitress looked at us like we were from Mars when we declined her offer of washing it for us.  The cup didn't land in anything nasty, I couldn't see the point in washing it.  We also don't use anything to cover the table before Mugwump eats off of it.  She's 11.5 months old, all she's going to do is destroy the item her food is placed on!  I wonder though; are we getting raised eyebrows on that simply because of the germ factor, or the mess the wait staff has to clean up?  Another thing I fail to understand in public is those buggy covers that you see for sale.  You put them on the interior of the shopping cart seat so that little Johnny can sit in a nice clean seat and mommy doesn't have to worry about Johnny touching or chewing on a surface that some nasty person with nasty hands did.  Or people who wipe down the carts with anti-bacterial wipes before touching them.  Or how about those loverly paper toilet seat covers, the ones that resemble tissue paper.  I wonder who ever thought that one up.  They don't really protect you from anything, and it's not like a lot of things will survive if it did get on the seat anyhow.  It really bothers me how society has evolved into thinking that everything must be germ-proofed.  These innovations didn't exist 100 or even 50 years ago.  What is the big push to have everything pristine?  Is it that inner control freak that resides in us all?  Germs are a part of nature, and nature cannot be contained, only worked with.  So, for all of you germaphobes out there, you can just keep on sterilizing.  Me and my family will be carrying on, not worrying constantly about all of the germs.

      So I take the kids outside to play, great for them to use up some steam before bed.  We discover that someone is stealing our kids toys!  Yesterday we were suspicious because their Clifford ball is missing-we were debating on if wind could've blown it away.  Well, now it's official.  Another one of their balls has gone missing, an old volley ball.  I think some of their toy cars are gone too, and a plastic furby.  I know the whole reason this happens, the ignorant parents in this hell-hole of a trailer park who let their kids out alone to play.  I'm not talking about 6, 7, 8 year olds or even teenagers.  These buffoons leave their TODDLERS out alone to play!  Often, I've seen 3 year olds left to watch 18 month olds!  It's so infuriating.  These children steal toys, play in the road (and look at you like you're evil because you're driving), and just raise holy hell without any supervision.  A good number of these parents are either sitting on their duffs watching TV, doing drugs, or banging someone while their kids run amuck.  I will be so very glad when we move.

      I've got a lot of stuff to do, and so little time in which to do it.  We're trying to buy a house, and I have things with that to get around-not to mention PACKING!  I hate moving, but we haven't a choice in this one.  We live in a place that is far too small for all of us, and we just can't stay here any longer.  Not to mention, I hate it here.  Trailer park living isn't for me, that is for sure.  Hopefully I can get Miss Thang to take a nap so I can call the mortgage agent in peace.  I need to give her the address to the house we're interested in to see if it qualifies for the Rural Housing Program or not.    Monster Man is up for another MRI on the 16th, and I'm not looking forward to that.  They just want to make certain the scar tissue on his brain isn't getting worse, but I still hate it.  I know it's needed, but AFAIAC if he's doing better (he is), why is it needed?  Sometimes I have to wonder if doctors do things because they are needed, or out of greed for themselves.  I don't have much faith in the medical community these days.  On top of everything else, I have to make certain the house is in order at all times.  God only knows when that CPS lady will show up again.  I really wish people would just mind their own freaking business.  So our house is a little cluttered, it's not a danger to anyone.  650 sq ft of living space + 2 adults + 3 kids under 5=CHAOS!  There's just not enough space for all of us and our shit.  Thus why we're looking to move!  Another thing that doesn't help anything is little Miss Thang aka Madame Destructo.  She's already destroyed her dresser to the point that I had to throw it away.  She tried to do the same thing with Monster Man's dresser, so that is out in the shed.  This leaves no where for their clothes to go, so they reside on the dryer.  And both Monster Man and Miss Thang love to torment one another, I can't leave them alone together to clean somewhere else.  Shit, I can't even go piss without taking Miss Thang with me.  Mugwump I think is part Klingon the way she loves to be attached to my breast or hip all day.  I don't mind it though, it's fun and I wouldn't trade my kids for the world.  So my house isn't spotless at all times (hell..when has it ever been spotless for a moment?), I'd rather have fun with my kids than have a pristine home.  It is nice being able to walk through a room with out stepping on legos (those damned things hurt!) or other toys though. :)  Ahh..my life is so much fun!

      I finally started a blog.  Been meaning to for some time, but just haven't gotten down to it.  This should prove to be interesting.  Can't write much now though, the children are beckoning for me. :)

      Mugwump was born on this day, last year at 6:06 am.  I can't believe she is already 1 year old!!  Time flies so fast.  This is kind of bittersweet for me since she is our last.  She's growing up..and very very independent.  Happy birthday darling!

      The little things mean so much.  Grcmnky came home today with four long stem roses for me, 1 red and 3 pink.  He did it to say: "Thanks for tolerating me.".  He's not been home a lot as of late, he's been helping out on the family farm after work.  He gets home around 1pm and sleeps until 9pm.  The kids barely see him.  He also let me get in a shower before he scampered off to bed.  Nice cool shower...mmmmmmm.  I don't like it when he's not around much, I feel it cheats the kids, but I understand why he's doing this.  He likes to help out family, and he's trying to earn some extra for when we go to move.  Moving expenses suck.  He is a good man, and I think it's nice that he let me know that he appreciates me.  I needed that. :)

      Ugh.  My mom was telling me what my cousin L had to say about me being fat.  Mom had sent a pic to my Aunt C (L's mom) since Aunt C had asked if I was still doing the renaissance festival thing.  I just got a new costume for this year and I took some digi pics and sent them to mom.  Well Aunt C sent the pics to L and L saw it fit to send a rant to my mom about how being fat was bad and blah blah blah.  L is quite skinny, but not very pretty.  She has some nasty scars on her back due to scoliosis surgery and some scars on her face and collar bone from a car accident.  But L seems to think that she is the shit just because she's thin.  So fucking what.  Skinny isn't everything.  I'll admit, I'd like to lose the weight that I've gained over the years.  But I am currently nursing Mugwump and the only thing I've found to work for me is Atkins, which I cannot do while nursing.  Mugwumps health is far more important to me than fitting into a size 12 (that's the skinniest I can go, I'm 5'10" and large boned).  I'm also hypoglycemic, and suffer from IBS.  My mom totally went off on L in a response, defending me and telling her to not talk smack about her daughter.  I just hate how some people get such a superiority complex about themselves!!  All that really matters to me is that grcmnky likes me the way I am.  That is what is important, that and me being comfortable in my own skin-which for the most part I am.  I don't mind the weight gain that I've had from having children.  I regard it in the same way I do stretch marks, battle scars!!  L can shove her hoity toity attitude right up her bum!

      Monster Man will indeed be in Young Fives this fall rather than Kindergarten. He was tested today and it turns out that he's on the same level as a child that is 3 years and 9 months old. He's simply not ready for K and Young Fives will help him get up to par. The teacher was thinking that maybe we could get him on speech services-something we tried to get done after his first MRI in December, but was told he's borderline normal, so he didn't qualify. I have a hard time believing that he was even borderline normal then if all he is at this stage now. He's been improving since December, so I can't see how that diagnosis was correct. I just think they didn't want to help us for whatever reason. We had tried getting an appointment set up in January of 2003 and they didn't show up and didn't return my calls to re-schedule. Then they told the pediatrician that it was my fault...they were to come to MY HOUSE, so how is it MY FAULT they didn't show and wouldn't return my calls? I'm just glad that Monster Man will be getting what he needs now.  For those who don't know, Monster Man has scar tissue on his brain in the left quadrant that the neurologist thinks is congenital. He's not had any severe head injuries, so this is the only logical conclusion. He doesn't have any diseases either. What tipped us off was his severe speech delay, he only started talking coherntly shortly after turning 4. We finally got a pediatrician that took us seriously and didn't just say "he'll grow out of it", she ordered testing. First, two EEG's (one, and then the other when the first was borderline abornormal). After that, we were referred to a pediatric neurologist who ordered the MRI's. The first one showed scar tissue in the left quadrant, possibly old gliosis. This explains the speech problems, memory problems, and severe left-handednesss. He'll use his left hand, even when inconvient to do so. The second MRI revealed no change, which is good. It's been a long road..and I don't think the end is in sight any time soon. I've got a feeling we're gonna be fighting for him for a long time.

      Ugh, I just got off of the phone with my BIL (D). He and SIL (N) borrowed some money from us that was loaned to us for a down-payment on a house. They needed to do that because D started a new bank account and the bank didn't inform him until after he deposited his payroll check that there would be a ten day hold because the account was under thirty days old. They had drafted a check against the account for their mini-van payment, so they needed to borrow the money in order not to bounce the check. Grcmnky agreed to it as long as they paid it back when they got the money. They were supposed to have the money in the account yesterday. Grcmnky said to give them a day to pay it and then call. I call today and D informs me that they had this problem with the check deposit cleared up last week and that they won't have the money to pay us until Friday! WTF??? The agreement was to pay us back when they had the check cleared. Not spend our money and pay us when it is convenient. We need that money for making a down-payment. I didn't think it was a good idea to lend out the money, but grcmnky insisted that he should help out family. Well, no more. I won't allow it. I don't care if I look like a bitch. N is known for spending beyond her means, and so is D. They filed bankruptcy 2 years ago because they couldn't handel their finances.   It didn't teach them much of a lesson, grcmnky &amp; I are both waiting to see how long it takes them to have either their truck, van, or house re-possesed because they can't pay their bills.

      Monster Man informs me that SIL's (N) friends (S & S) son (C) told him that grcmnky isn't his daddy, but that he is Miss Thangs daddy!  This is true, but we wanted to wait until Monster Man was a bit older to explain this to him.  We've mentioned it a bit, but haven't gone into too much detail as he is only 4.75 years old.  I want to know why they were even discussing this around C, he's only a few months older than Monster Man.  It's not their place, or their kids place to tell Monster Man this!   How would they feel if I or Monster Man told their daughter (J) that S isn't her father?  She's 9, and they don't intend on telling her anytime soon (I don't think they ever intend on it, they want to wait until the time is right.  There isn't really a right time.).  They'd be pissed if someone told on them like that.  Just like N would be pissed if I or Monster Man told her daughter (M) that BIL (D) isn't her father.  Or if we told D's family that he isn't M's father.  They've even lied to them about it.  N was 2 months pregnant when her and D got together.  His name is even on the birth certificate.  But you don't see us discussing these matters around our children, or tatteling on them because it's not appropriate.  This just adds on to the reasons I want to stay away from S&S and their kids.  It's proving to be a damn near impossibility because N is constantly having them over to her house, and fails to inform us when she does.  Grcmnky doesn't want to deprive the kids of seeing family, so we go.  I will be so fucking happy when we move out of this damned town and away from these idiots!!  If we don't live nearby, we won't have to see them!!
