      God its like every time I have plans to do something with my friends it gets screwed up! I hate it soOo much. I'm always working always always always! I hate Babysitting my Aunts evil brat. And she asks me to everyday! I was supposed to go to the movies and the mall. But noo I have to fuckin babysit! When can I just get out of the fucking house with out someone being on my ass about something and just have a good time! But whatever I think I'm gunna bail I dont care about the money.. I have enough right now.. I could use more but fuck it I'm not anyone's slave. Even though sometimes I feel like it.. I seriously feel like my cousin Olivia is my baby.. I'm with her more then her mother is. I'm the one she comes to when she's getting fussy. I'm the one who feeds, washes and puts her to bed practically every night. She even calls me mommy which I hate. I'm not a mom even though people could get the wrong impression because they always see her with me.. But who cares what people think.. Not me.. Well I'm gunna go get ready my dad is having some friends over for some thing for work.. I dont know but of course I have to help out.. So I'll write more later..

      Its days like today where I look back on everything thats happened in the last few months and I feel like I was stupid..Ever since I started going to see Raechel..I feel alot better..I can finally confide in an actual person. Not in a journal or something. Yesterday when I went to visit her. I cried I told the first adult that I used to cut myself. I told her how I used to feel like it was me against the world. And there was nothing I could do. I used to feel so fucked up inside that I wanted to die.. I wanted everything to end and I wanted to die and let every one suffer the way I thought I was suffering. Being 14  and depressed isnt easy. I had a boyfriend who tried to get me to have sex with him every chance he had. A mother who I could never turn to because she never understood she would always act like I was being dramatic when all I tried to do was tell her how I felt. All my friends never knew because I tried to pretend like I was okay but everyone knew it wasnt when I fell apart and freaked out at school. Screaming just going nuts I hated everyone.. And thats when the school called my parents and told them that I needed a therapist. But what ever..Today was pretty boring .. I cant wait till school starts a new school a new year a clean slate.. this year things will be better I'll make sure of it..It'll be hard making new friends but I'm in recovery of my self esteem so hopefully I feel alot better about myself I have 3 weeks..but eh.. I'm tired I think I'm gunna go to bed... Got people coming over tomorrow.. So night!
