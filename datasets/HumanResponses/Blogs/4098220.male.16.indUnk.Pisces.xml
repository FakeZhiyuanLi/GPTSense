       since this is my first entry, I thought that I should give some background of current life. I have 3 bros., Justin(14), Zach(10) and Kyle(7), I also have 2 sis., Julia(8) and Kirstynn(6). Shall I go on with my life?  Lets see, where to begin... Well my "father", who I have disowned, has filled for custody of my brother Justin. And of course him being my brother I don't want him to leave. But it looks like I am going to lose that battle because Justin wants to go live with him.  Kyle, who I don't see anymore, because my "father" threatened his mother so she left with him and her family to live where they won't be found, is missed dearly by me... And I hope that one day I can see him once again. I have only gotten to speak to him once and I have some updated pic. of him, which I would like to get to have more of both.  So what's going on now? Well theres this girl, Jessica, who I like VERY much. But of course she is into another guy who I dislike VERY much. So I'm not sure whats going to happen there. There is this other girl, Stacie, who I have fallen in love with, over the past 8 years that I have known her. And I really don't know what is going to happen there either.  My best friend, Justin, who I have know for ever... has just recently told me that he is gay, which of course was a big shocker to me and the rest of mine and his friends.  So as you can see my life, to me, is very complicated and confusing, so by writting these entries, I hope that it will help me with how I am feeling.   (To Be Continued...)

       God Damn it... I keep forgetting about this. Well the past few days have been so-so. Monday, I had to babysit and go to my first day of band practice. Oh yah band is here, it's about freakin time.  Anyway... Tuesday, My sister, Kirstynn, woke up and let her friends in the house while I was still asleep. Oh did that piss me off... Oh well, later we went to McDonald's for lunch... Woopty-do-da-day!!! Then even later that night I had to go to band practice. But we did not get to march outside because Freshman had there...I don't remember what you call it. So we were stuck in the band room for a whole 4 hours.  Today, I had to go to some court thing and boy-o-boy was that fun... NOT! I had to get up at freakin 10:30am just to be downtown at 1:00pm for a hour and a half appointment.  This is where I must end because I have not lived the rest of the day yet. So tune in, hopefully, tomorrow...(To Be Continued...)

       Well I can not seem to find my disk that has my past few days of entries, so let me tell you has been going on... lets see where to begin? Well umm, band starts tomorrow and I can not wait for that to begin. I know I have said that before but I can't seem to stop telling about it. You have no idea how much I have been practicing for drum major and for band this summer... oh wait...I haven't practiced at all.  My brother Zach slept over last night, oh what a project that was. He is always needing attention... Arg ... thats not easy to do for me I mean I get bored with things after a while.  Oh I want to also say that I have noticed that Justin is not allowing comments on his page anymore. Why not??? Could it be for the fact that Logan might find out about it? Hmmm makes me wonder... makes us all wonder.  My shows on tonight... I can not wait for it to start. Only 2 more hours to wait, thats why I am typing this up... it gives me something to do. But it will not last that much longer, because I have nothing more to write about. *Tear* well maybe not, but hey it gave a little more to talk about. Oh but I do have something to cry and/or complain about... there is only 2 more episodes of it left for this season... how sad.  Oh yah... I saw Sarah P. at McDonalds... She was my health buddy this past year and she was and still is in my band. I am going to miss being her health buddy. We had such fun times.  Well I have nothing more to write about, so I am going to end with... well nothing... (To Be Continued...)

       Man, I missed another day. I have got to be more consistent with these, otherwise it will seem like I was M.I.A. (missing in action) for those missed days. Any way my last few days went from boring to completely awesome back to boring, or yet less entertaining.    (What I was going to write yesterday) Yesterday, Monday, was absolutely boring. Well to continue from yesterdays entry... I had to baby-sit my sisters, again. Julia was acting up, so I called my Aunt Sharon to see if she could come and pick us up to go swimming of her house, she said yes, of course, and that she would be on her way after her kids finished their chores. So about an hour and a half later, she calls back and tells me she’s going to be leaving, to come pick us up, in a couple of minutes. She also told us to be ready to go. So, I got the girls in their bathing/swimming suits and we waited... and waited... and waited. Aunt Sharon ends up calling me again, about another hour and a half, and says she’s not going to be picking us up, because she was fighting with her daughter, Malissa, about cleaning her room. I was pissed now. My sisters and I had just spent around three hours waiting for her, and now she’s not even coming. Oh wait but she did say that she would pick us up tomorrow. Urg, now it was about 5pm and now my sisters have nothing to do, and neither do I. What an afternoon!    Later that nigh... I called Aunt Sharon back, about 6:30pm, I think, and asked if I could pick us her son, Christopher, because I was extremely bored. She said I could, so I did. Chris and I got back to my house around 7:15pm’ish, and we played video games till about 11pm then watched Family Guy, and then Futurama. If you can’t tell he spent the night. Of course after watching those programs we still weren’t tired so we stayed up for another hour or so chitchatting.    This morning Chris and I woke up about 9am, and we stayed in my room just watching T.V. and stuff until 11:30am. We had a hard time keeping my sisters out but I just told them that Chris was still sleeping and that they could come in when he was awake. Is that smart of me or what?    Later around 12:30pm, Aunt Sharon called and said that we could go over and swim if we wanted. So once again I rounded up the girls, but this time I drove them over there. When we got there she was cleaning the pool so we still had to wait, but that was ok, cause we were going to go swimming this time. We were there till about 4:30pm’ish, oh by the way, Julia, she’s at one of her friends house. I dropped her off there sometime earlier. Anyway I took Kirstynn home around 5pm and then went to pick up Julia. I can’t wait to see what the rest of my day will be like! (To Be Continued...)    (What I am writing today) It turns out that the rest of my day yesterday was great. I had one of my best friends, Justin, spend the night, and we were up till about three in the freakin’ morning. Oh I was so tired but I just couldn’t fall asleep. We ended up just talking about "stuff".    That same morning, just much later, approx. 9am, we both woke up and went down stairs to get something to drink. That’s when, I think, I told him about my really cool dream that I had last night. In my dream I was taking things and "kidnapping" my brother, Kyle, from my "gathers" house, because, well if you don’t know yet... I don’t want "wayne" to ever see him again, and sometime near the end of the dream, I ended up killing him with his own gun. Now I know to most people that would seem disturbing, but for those people who know my "sperm donner"... well I think you get it. Actually come to think of it I don’t remember telling Justin about the Kyle part.    Anyways... later that day we played video games. on his Xbox, I don’t remember what the game was called, but it was cool. Actually I believe we played it the whole day, well not when I had to make my sisters lunch, cause oh yah, I had to baby-sit, them yet again. But baby-sitting them today was, well funny. I let them draw on the walls, with chalk, and I also let them jump around my Justin’s, brother, bed. I think they had a lot of fun today. They better not tell what I let them do, because if they do, I will be in so much trouble. So, I ended up taking Justin home around, oh I don’t remember. But it was after my brother, Justin, got home from HIS fathers. According to someone, who shall remain anonymous, said, and I quote " that kids a piece of work." And I completely agree with that person.    Oh I forgot to mention something earlier... before I picked up Justin, friend, my sister, Julia, and I cleaned out my fishes tank. What a job that was. First we had to take out about 15 gallons. of water, then catch the fish, completely empty the tank out and clean with soap and stuff. Next we had to replace everything, that’s when I left to go pick up Justin. When I got back we, Julia and I, put the fish back in the tank. We had to wait till after I picked up Justin, cause the water wasn’t room temperature yet.    I can’t wait for this weekend to come, I invited my brother, Zach, to come spend the night on Saturday. I am so looking forward to seeing him again, cause I haven’t seen him sense about the middle of February, or so. I really don’t know what we are going to do while he is here, but I’m sure we will find something to do. Oh man, I can’t wait! (To Be Continued...)

       The day started out slow today... I had to get up early, about 9:30am ish. Anywho, I got up and I found that I had to go to see my phsyco doctor, you know to talk about Wayne and shit. What a blast that was... not! On our way home Julia, my sister, started to throw a temper because she though that Justin, brother, was going to be mean to her all day. Well Justin ended up going to his dads. Thank God, I mean me...  Later when we got home, Julia was starting to throw another screaming fit because I wouldn’t take them to the playground... come on I am a night time person. So anyway, my mom had to go to work, so what did Julia do? She started to scream and bitch about that. Oh what a nightmare. Hopefully when I call my aunt Sharon she will be able to bring Malissa, cousin, over to come play with the girls.  On my next entry you will hear about how, unhappy, the rest of my day is...(To Be Continued...)

       Well once again my internet is not working so when this is posted as an entry and you, the world, can finally read it you should know that it was cut and pasted. To start off the day, I got up at about 11:00am, and that is very early to me... anyway... I got up, and I realized, or better yet reminded, that I was to go pick up my uniform from the school today. Ha that was a trip. So I got there around 12:15pm or so, and of course everything was a mess. I went up a size in pants, but hey there is a good side to my visit, Jessica actually said hi, well ok... she said hey... but that’s still weird cause, as you remember she is mad at me. While on my journey at the school, I also ran into Jill Certo, and of course she is looking fine, as usual. To bad she is, or was, just a dream.  The Days was on today, again another wonderful episode. I can not believe the shit that goes on in their lives. But I still think that it would be cool if my life was like that. My mom is also now hooked on the show, she says that she doesn’t like it, but I caught her watching it in her bedroom.  Christopher, my cousin, was over today, oh what fun that was. We watched the Blair Witch Project... oh it was so scary. And the ending, wow I never saw it coming. Maybe I will invite Jessica to come and watch it with me, that is of course if she is still talking to me.  Hmm I just realized that typing up my thoughts on how the day is or has been, is a lot easier for me than if I wore to have to write it in some entry for English class or something. I don’t know, maybe this will be the “new” me. Ha, I hear Al, stepfather, in the background talking to himself. He seems to do that a lot, like he wants me to be listening or something. Which reminds me, I found that parents can be so unfair, I mean “they” tell us that we can’t do something yet they go on ahead and do it. Why do people act this way? Should it not be the same for all people? I mean isn’t that what this country is all about?  You’ll have to hear the rest in my next entry, but until then... have the best days of your lives... I know I’m not... (To Be Continued...)

       Pay no attention to the last entry... I was just having fun and messing around with Justin. So my computer has not been working the past few days, so I am typing up this entry over my aunt and uncles.  2 Days ago... I really did nothing, I mean... Well yah I guess I did nothing. It was such a boring day, for some reason I have been having a lot of those lately. I don't know... Oh that's right, I went over to Crissy's house, unfortunately Jessica went over there to, so I ended up going home after a little while.  Yesterday I got my shots and my family and I went to Jim and Jens... Their friends of the family. While I was there I got a new playstation game... Driver 2. I also borrowed a movie... The Blair Witch Project. I have not watched it yet but... I hear its good. Is it?  Today I helped my Aunt and Uncle pack their stuff. I guess they are moving from Waynes County to somewhere near Indiana. So they will live pretty far away so we won't go and see them as often as we do now.  Tomorrow I am going to pick up my uniform for band. I hope that I will see some of my old friends there. But who really knows? We will just have to see. (To Be Continued...)

       Yah so yesterday was a complete bore... well until big gay Justin came over. I called him about 9:30pm and told him to pack his bags, cause I am going to pick his ass up. Well maybe not in so many words... but hey I got to spice it up for the entry. Don't I? Who cares cuase I am going to do it anyway.       So... umm... Jessica is still not talking to me, but something tells me, I don't care... oh wait thats just me. Eh shes a bitch anyway. Justin just said that hes always limp... well not when he sees matt and logan. Well see if I care if hes not for me... am I not good enough?!?!? So I hear that he also likes to keep his legs wide open...and his ass... just incase... if you know what I mean.      I write more when Justin is not around.(To Be Continued...)

       Well the rest of my day yesterday was ok... until I got the letter/note, from that horrible "Bi-atch", Jessica. For every one who wants to know... heres what it said... and I am leaving nothing out...  Tommy, Why did you write that letter to me? I really don't and have never, had those kind of feelings about you. I love you as a frien, nothing more. I'm pretty sure that I never gave you the impression I liked you like that, Especially loved you! If it seemed like I was flirting with you at all before you went on vacation I'm sorry I meant nothing by it. You having those feelings for me being the reaso why I shouldn't be with Matt is selfish. I don't want to lose you as a friend but I can't return those feelings because I have them for only Matt. I'm sorry I also think it was unfair of you to tell me. Right now I don' tthink we should hang out because I'm kind of uncomfortable by the whole situation. I'll let you know when I wanna talk again. Jessica  What a note huh? Well I don't think that I am going camping with her and her family this coming weekend. But hey who knows right?  Oh I want to thank Justin for not sending me that picture last night. I was so afraid to open up my email. And I am sorry, Justin, that you had to see what you did... although you probably liked it...  Well tomorrow is another day, so maybe everything will pan out in the end... we just have to wait and see. (To Be Continued...)

       Today is going to be pretty boring... I have to babysit my two little sisters today, which sucks cuase now I can't go hang out with my friends. But its not like I would be able to anyway, because, as I said in a previous entry, they only come out at night. Oh yah that reminds me... I gave Jessica the note, I do know what she thinks about it yet because she read it last night, well I think she did. And I have yet to hear from her. Speaking of Jessica, yesterday I accidentaly hit her in the eye with a kick board, when we were swimming at my aunt Sharons house. There we, Jessica, Melissa, and I, played volleyball. For some odd reason the ball kept going out of the pool, we just blamed it on Julia!  So my show, The Days, was on last night. It was such a good episode, oh I can not wait for the next one. I told Justin, best friend, to watch it, he better have or he's going to get it.  I can not wait for school to start... I'll get to see my friends that I don't get to see over the summer... such as Sam, and Karly... of course there is many more but It would take up to much space to type up.  Julia just did her hair... it looks so funny, but I dare not tell her that... or do I? It would be fun to watch her get mad... its always funny to see that. Speaking of watching, I am watching the Fairly Odd Parents Movie, Channel Chasers. Its not the best, but it is wasting time...  Hope the rest of the day is better, but you won't find out till tomorrow afternoon (To Be Continued...)

       Well as I can tell, so far it is going to be a lay back kind of day. Last night I hung out with a couple of my close friends, Melissa, Jessica, and Allie. All we really did was walk around the neighborhood and sat around in Jessica and Allies driveway... somehow that's what we always end up doing... Wow we are pretty damn boring.  The only thing I really have to look forward today is my show, The Days, which comes on at 10:00pm on channel ABC if anyone cares to know. What am I going to do till then? I would go hang out with some of my friends, but for some reason they only come out when it is cloudy or night time. Oh I just remembered I have a note to give to Jessica, I don't know what it is but I can, for some reason, say things better on paper. Is that weird?  So Al, step father, has finally decided to let me use his car to go to school, for my early bird class, of course I don't how long that will last... Oh for those who don't know what early bird class is... its a class that starts at 6:45am, you know... before school starts.  My life Blows... (To Be Continued...)
