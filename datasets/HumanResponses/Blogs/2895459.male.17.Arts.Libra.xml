       Thomas, thanks for re-sending the invitation... I'm doing a poem, not sure if I'm gonna do Robert Frost, though.  He doesn't really have a particular style.  Some poems he does 10 syllables per line, some 9, some 7, etc...  But then, I could just combine elements of all of his poems...  If I was doing one of the essays, though, I would do the Robert Frost one.  It seems easier than all of the rest.

       Hey Everyone: IS EVERYBODY EITHER DOING A POEM OR DOING THE ESSAY THAT TALKS ABOUT ROBERT FROST? Anybody doing any essay prompt besides that? or I'm just such an outcast that I can find not a single accomplice to share ideas with

       Hey how did everyone think of that really "interesting hands on" activity we did on "CELEBRATION?" I guess it was a really powerful activity for our class (third period) to get all the people engaged. I celebrate the fact that we don't have to do that activity every day, only a little change for one day.

       To me it seems like Whitman's going on a "poetic rant" of sorts on his thoughts of life, love, happiness, etc.  He's not necessarily praising himself as much as he's just praising his life in general.  Man, I could sure use a fat bag of the crack he was smoking right now...  ;-)

       I have to say that I'm not as interested in reading Night because I read it in eighth grade and it is a very emotional book that I would prefer to read once only because it is so sad.  However since it seems curriculum here is different and students here haven't yet read it, I suppose that's unfair of me.  I'll read it again if I have to.

            -Hello AP English, this is Ryan Elliott and I'm a rookie to Blogger.com.       I recall reading Night freshman year in Mrs. Micheel's English class, and the impression the story left on me brings to mind the narratives of Fredderick Douglas and Harriet Jacobs.  The accounts of the Holocaust enable the reader to experience the horror firsthand, and each individual number in the death totals suddenly forms a face.  At the beginning of the year I remember Mrs. VA stressing the importance of showing and not telling in writing, and I feel in many cases that history can tell a story, but it takes a first person account like Night or the narratives of Douglas and Jacobs to show the reader a story and make them live it.  Considering the current study of World War II in AP History, I think Night would be an excellent compliment.        The present study of World War II with Ms. Clark has made me feel disappointed in American diplomacy because of the decision to drop atom bombs on two Japanese cities.  When encountering the situation, I pretended I was a soldier in WWII, and I tried to think of how I would have felt about our actions.  Not only am I shocked at the civilian aimed tactics implemented globally during the war, but also I am troubled by America's decision to take part.  Personally, I would have difficulty enlisting in the military because of the possibility that I could be asked to carry out a mission like the one presented to Paul Tibbets, the pilot of the Enola Gay.  I believe war is a conflict between armed military soldiers, and does not involve intentional civilian casualties.  In today's military this death count is accounted for by the term collateral damage, which masks its true definition probably for the morale of soldiers and the maintenance public relations.  I can't imagine I would feel at peace pledging allegiance to a nation who was engaging in civilian warfare.  I love my country and would no doubt serve if conscripted; however, I feel the line in the pledge of allegiance, "with liberty and justice for all" extends to all people of the world, and that the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were injustices to the Japanese people.       I believe pledging allegiance to the United States of America means promising one's devotion to preserve the liberty and justice of our nation while attempting to extend the basic courtesies to all who we come in contact with.  The invisible borders separating the people of the world are self created illusions, much like the concept of racial differences, that do nothing to obscure the sanctity of democratic rights or our responsibility to uphold them.

       YES I'M VERY MUCH INTERESTED! To me, historical literature are especially fun to read, especially when it compliments with what we are studying in history. And the holocaust is certainly a dramatic period of history and literture that would sprout out many ideas about morality, wars, politics and the whole theme of race and injustices. I may not be able to speak for the whole class, but it's certainly a great topic to discuss and read about! I'm sure Tristan would be interested in it too! :)  And well, since Rob, you've started the pledge of allegiance debate, I have already posted a huge long post about the pledge in the history blog, but I think it's relevant for me to post my argument on this blog too because it touches on the issue of individualism and what is to be an American (the whole themes we've studied all year).  And don't blame me for writing about this thing for so long, but it is inevitable. Of course everyone knows that the 1st Amendments guarantees "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.......". And then one can debate FOREVER what does that mean, either pro pledge of allegiance, the under God phrase, or opposes it. Either way, both sides can site the constitution to argue for their sides. LOL that's the beauty of our first amendment, even tho it may be concise, it's still very interpretative. And the society is sooooooooo complex that a few words in the constitution can be argued forever into future generations.   As a former buddhist, and currently agnostic, to me personally, the "Under God" phrase doesn't offend me. But the act of conforming is. I have nothing against people saying or chanting Under God at anytime, anywhere, or under any occassion; the constitution guarantees their rights to do so. The thing that bothers me is the act of telling others what to do or not to do. How does that relate to the pledge of allegiance is the fact that little kid six years old have to say the pledge of allegiance. And did you know all the MEANING of the words in the pledge of allegiance when you were six? To me it's almost ridiculous to impose others to say what they don't even know what they are saying, and what it means......let alone believes in it. So the little kids just memorize the phrase and spew it out like robots. And that's not what America is all about.....  What makes America great and the beauty of this country is the fact that it's a country of immigrants, and EVERBODY is different, and the constitution really protects the DIFFERENCE of all individuals. In fact, individualism is not only protected, but glorified and encouraged all throughout American literature from the declaration of independence and onwards.   And from individualism comes with it, differences of ideas, clash of cultures, criticisms, and sometimes stuff that people don't want to hear.  What bothers me is when people stop wanting to hear complaints and other points of views. Any criticism, or other radical ideas becomes BAD and immediately shuts off from debates........And everybody has to praise everybody, praise the government, praise all the institutions, all the ideas and so on. And even if you don't, you are somehow peer pressured, or forced to comply with the "majority" point of view. Some of America's greatest writers were critics of the time, and often deemed radicals because of their foiling of the truth......truth that the majority didn't want to admit. Like Mark Twain's Huck Finn realism style writing that foils the true life of the South from a common southern white orphan boy's point of view. (Of course it's not just happy little child pacifer literature that's all happy and good. Because the society isn't always that good).   Seriously think about, what a society would be like if everyone is the same, think the same way, and all are happy with each other with no reason. Everybody would just lose their personality and the society itself will become dumber.   And education is really when the clash between conformity and individualism occurs. In order to preserve the individualisms as America's embodiment, I believe that in schools, since it's a public place, the state or government should have no say in what the kids should say. The kids are just kids, they are learning and developing.........And wheh pledge of allegiance is inserted to thehir curriculum since their first day in school.....And have memorize something they don't even know what it is......it totally defeats the American character. Education is to develop people to become individuals, to become smart citizens with an critical eye, and not to turn everybody into robotic conformists.   And as always, I welcome all dissagreements, criticisms, opinions and would like to debate this issue with others.  Differences of opinions is good!  Thomas Chen

       Hmmm...I'm starting to think ahead to curriculum after spring break, when we will have time to read another book and also to prepare for the AP exam.  I know from talking with Miss  Clark that her classes have recently been spending time studying the Holocaust, and I'm thinking about Kailie's expression of frustration.  Why didn't Jim just run?  A similar question is often, "Why didn't the Jews just band together and keep the Nazis from treating them so poorly."  I'm wondering...are you folks interested in reading a first-hand account of Auschwitz after break?  The book I'm thinking of is Night, written beautifully by Elie Wiesel.  It's a quick read, but it's also a hard read because of the subject matter.  It isn't American lit (Wiesel was Romanian, I believe), but that doesn't really matter for the test.  What do you all think?  Would it be best to be presented with a variety of options before deciding?  As for your question about the Pledge of Allegiance, Rob...I find myself asking many more questions in addition to the one about the "under God" phrase.  For example, what does it mean to pledge allegiance to a flag at a time when patriotism is so integrated with war-making?  I cannot help but remember photos I've seen of Nazi swastika flags hanging over church altars during World War II.  As a religious person, I want to see a full separation of church and state so that I am left to practice my faith as I see fit.  I believe others have that right, too.  Although I believe that we exist by the grace of God, not everyone does.    So what does our flag stand for?  When we pledge allegiance to it, what are we promising to do or not do?  What is the role of God in a pluralistic country?  What binds us together as a people, particularly as we become a more diverse society every year?  Does pledging allegiance mean committing ourselves to creative peace-making, or only that we will pick up arms if attacked?  And what about "justice for all"?  These are the questions I ask myself every day at the beginning of third period.  What do you all think? Mrs. V-A

       First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please.  It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different?  I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid.  The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge.  I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them.  To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state.  Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it.  One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology.  Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please.  With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs.  The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones.  As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country.  For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life.  Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so.  My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me!  If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short!  Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break?  Because they all spark my interest.  Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning.  Love,  Rob

       In response to Kailie, I think your point about how Jim's not afraid of enduring through all of these ridiculous rituals imposed by Tom (If I interpreted you correctly), illustrates Jim's complex charactor and heroic quality. Jim, as a slave, probably has a really low self-esteem and he comes from the world where slaves have to listen to whites for every little nuts and bolts. Of course Jim did not know he was free, (any slave would think it's a miracle if somebody proclaimed they were free). So he just thought "this is the way everything is done, because Tom said so".  Even though he has the brain to mention it's a ridiculous idea like making up a coat of arm, but he still follows the order, because who knows what will happen to him if a slave doesnt obey a white man's order.  But I understand where you come from. I also felt very weird these things were happening, but lots of weird things happen back then, a lot of things today would consider very very sick and unbearble......So in trusting Twain's realism style of writing, I have to just interpret what I can about the society from Twain's words.

       I was really frustrated when reading the end of the book when Tom and Huck were "rescuing" Jim. I couldn't help but get past the idea that, if Jim were really worried about getting away from slavery and afraid for his life, he wouldn't jump through all the hoops for Tom's perfect scheme. I felt it was a little unrealistic; it's natural instinct to run when given the chance -- just like if a dog were to get free, he wouldn't sit around and wait for the perfect getaway. He'd just get out of there! Did anyone else feel anxious while reading this part in the book, or is it just me?

       Knowing what Jim had to go through and then at the end for him to just give it all up for the sake of Tom, proves Jim to be the more significant hero.  Throughout their whole journey Jim was always worried about Huck and concentrated on his friendship with Huck.  Whenever they were separted Jim would search forever for Huck until he found where he was.  They always ended up reuniting due mostly to Jim's love for Huck.  Not until the end of the book did Huck ever truly try to find Jim.  However at the end of the book Huck's love for Jim became more prevelant. Although Huck knew better than to do all the crazy things that Tom insisted they do in order to free Jim, somehow Huck's love for Jim was submissive to Tom's influence over Huck.  After trying so hard to escape to freedom then putting up with Tom's ideas of freeing a slave, Jim was still willing to risk it all for the sake of saving Tom.  This is what a true hero is.  Huck didn't have anything to lose, if people found out he had been trying to free a slave they would send him back to the widow's house and people would just think "that poor boy needs to be civilized." However for Jim, he had everything to lose, and he was willing to lose everything for Tom, who wasn't even a true friend to Jim.

       While both Huck and Jim can be seen as heroes, Jim is the more siginificant hero of the two because of not only the racism he faces by being a slave, but because he can overcome this racism by saving Tom in the end of the book.  In Tom's cruel and "adventurous" plan to help Jim escape to freedom puts Jim in a place where he is locked in a cabin, when he could be free.  Jim doesn't object to this plan because he figures that Tom is white and thus knows what he is doing.  After putting Jim through a month of being locked up, Tom does manage to help Jim escape.(even though Tom is shot in the leg)  This is the point that seperates Jim's heroism from Huck's.....Jim throws away the freedom that he has endured a month's "cabin fever" for to save Tom that has just put him through this month of isolation.

       In my opinion, Huck and Jim are both heros in this novel.  Huck is a hero in a sense that he decides to go to hell to save Jim, which was a huge decision to make at such a time in the South.  Later in the novel, Jim becomes the hero when he sacrifices his freedom (or so he thinks), the freedom that Huck has worked to protect, to save Tom's life.  Both Huck and Jim have their heroic moments by making huge moral decisions.  They both have to decide whether or not to do the right thing, and the fact that they both end up doing what's right makes them both heros.  Sorry, that made no sense...talking about stuff like this confuses me sometimes; I know what I want to say, but it just doesn't come out right!

       Hey guys, you can add one more to the total # of bloggers, making 19 i think?  Anyway, addressing Tom's point from the essay that Twain was writing for a racist audience doesn't sit well with me.  I'm not disagreeing that there were (and still are) many racists in this country, and probably some of them were fans of the original, Tom Sawyer, but I just don't get the feeling Twain wrote for an audience.  He was already a very successful author who had stopped needing to write for money, so I don't think the bottom line was his issue.  Every example of Twain's writing I've come across challenges cultural norms.  Whether addressing Christianity, poverty, or racism, he attacks each issue with the underestimated weapon of satire.  Flooding the tongue-in-cheek essays and novels with his own opinions, no matter how controversial.  I don't believe that Twain could be writing for a racist audience while openly attacking the Ku Klux Klan, and the entire establishment of Christianity.  If Twain avoided openly expressing Huck's love for Jim to the world, it was to get around his own nagging imperfections in his relations with blacks.  I don't believe that this was as much of a concious effort as Miss Morison claims.  Sometimes things are better off left to the imagination, e.g. the "humbles himself to a nigger" sentence is much more effective in my eyes than, "I'm sorry Jim, I didn't mean to worry you."  Lastly, although Morison's essay was very well articulated and worthy of consideration, it was very much speculation, just as I am writing now. I look forward to posting often and lengthily in this blog, so you've been warned.  By the way, the appeal to the removing "under god" from the pledge of allegiance began this week.  I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on that, as well as on Huck and the recent essay.  Love, Rob

       Hello!  My assumption is that extra credit will motivate many of you to access this site this weekend, so I thought I would throw out some questions we didn't have time for in class.    Who is the hero of the novel?  Huck or Jim?  What are the most significant themes from the book that affected you personally?    What about Toni Morrison's question:  "Yet the larger question, the danger that sifts fr om the novel's last page, si whether Huck, minus Jim, will be able to stay those three monsters as he enters the 'territory.'  Will that undefined space, so falsely imagined as "open," be free of social chaos, personal morbidity, and further moral complications embedded in adulthood and citizenship?  Will it be free not only of nightmare fathers but of dream fathers too?"  Have fun!  Remember to study for Monday's test.   :-)  Mrs. V-A

       HA....What I found so interested while reading through this essay was the fact that even tho Mark Twain might be a staunch abolitionists....For racial equality during that time period........But he also has to sell the book, make the book noteworthy.....And so Twain has to insert a lot of audience-awareness into his novel.......And since he knows a lot of the readers at the time are rascists......Therefore he makes Huck sometimes very uneasy to comment how good Jim is......Even tho Huck probably knows deep inside that Jim is a very good person......But he fails to admit it to anybody else........Even fail to admit fully to Jim and himself Huck's true feelings.  And of course Twain probably didn't know the future status of blacks/slaves, and all is very uncertain........So he had no choice but to retain some of the old stereotypical qualities.........Only today can we see it from an objective point of view.

       Don't blame me everyone..........but i've just thought of a great idea to implement for this blog......There are those "Open-ended" free response questions in the AP English exam (usually one a year), that has an open prompt and one has to write a mini expository essay about it, from your own experience.  And last year's was:   urlLink  "entertainment has the capacity to ruin society"  , defend, challenge, or qualify this assertion. Soooooooooo any cool ideas/agree/dissagree viewpoints on this statement.

       It was an astounding discussion today! I'm surprised at our third period class today, we actually did some genuine discussions! Without more than five minutes of silent stares at each other! That's a huge benchmark for us. LOL.   Ok Nova, we may have a different stance on this issue about the discussion of "racism". I think the controversy of it is really really interesting, and really relevant to the society we live in today. Maybe whining about it doesn't help, and only makes the matter worse. But one has to study the history behind racism, the history behind slavery, and study the current society in general to get all these controversies and see that these debates are very interesting. If we are living in a place like Chicago, Los Angeles, NYC, San Francisco, or Atlanta, we might see the issue and controversies surrounding the issues of race and racism in a very different way, because the societies of these urban centers are so polygot that you CANNOT ignore the issue of race at all. And it becomes so relevant to your everyday lives, whether you like it or not. So I don't think we can make a judgement on how the issue of "racism" is sooooo out of date and dumb now. To a lot of people, it's very relevant to their lives. And reading this book Huck Finn I'm sure will help us understand better the deep history behind slavery, race relationships between whites and blacks, that still influences our thinkings today. And I agree with today's discussion just banning the N word will not solve any any racial problem at all, not even down to the scale of molecules. There are a lot of other forms of racial discriminatory actions that we can not ban because of free speech issue such as Erin's description of all the confederate flags in the south still. And for christ's sake it's a piece of literature, one of the best pieces of American lit every written. And to the issue of calling people "whites", "blacks", "African Americans" whatever, I agree with the discussions today that it's a matter of respect. Some people maybe offended by calling "black", others maybe "African Americans", so it. But I agree that in general, we just have to see all people as one group of Americans, and not place any body into a race or cultural profile. --------- So, what do you think of that?

       The entire racism argument makes me mad.  Do people not get that Twain was anti-racist?  That he was trying to make a statement with Huck Finn?  And also, the "n-word" was used back then, and it was the common word for black people.  Making all the poor white people of the south talk in a more socially polite way would have been defeating a major point of the book, realism.  100 years from now, what if "black" is not politically correct?  Will they ban all the books written in present day, to censor "bad words"?  These people make me so mad!!!

       I think the people who are against this book for its portrayl of blacks need to look at how it shows whites. It shows cruel whites, white drunks, white racists, whites who steal, lie, cheat... so how does Mark Twain show black people in a negative light, when the majority of his criticisms are demonstrated through his white characters?

       I think we should have a discussion on Huck Finn and the controversy, it seems very interesting. I read this particular interesting thing in the passage that implied you need to be a "good teacher" , to actually use all the positive aspects of Huck Finn and teach more about the truth of slavery. One needs to teach Huck Finn in conjuction to the historical period behind it. An "insensitive teacher" may allow the racial impacts the word has on the students in the classroom goes unchecked, and allow students to "read aloud" in the classrooms.  But "on the contrary, studies have shown that, in the hands of a good teacher, the novel can actually have a positive impact on racial attitudes and increase in interracial understanding. I agree with the fact that if you don't see the true picture of that period in history, to see the life of a "common man", and use the language they use back then, one can not grasp a true concept of. And of course all of this have to be carefully studied in conjuction to a great understanding of the history of slavery and slave trading. That's why having the book in elementary and middle school is probably not a good idea. Because the kids then can't get ironies, satires, and the historical behind why Twain wrote this book and used the bad words to portrait the truth.

       Well, I would have gotten the first question right...  Anyway, Natalya, Tom suggested I talk to you about taking his place in the district MUN coming up in May.  I have the basic understanding of what goes on, but if you would like me to join you, you can e-mail at attakid117@attbi.com or call me at 574-1916 with info (specifically what I would need to do to prepare).  Hope to hear from you soon...  And to everyone else, Good Luck Monday!  Love, Rob

       Sorry, but I had to post this poem I found in one of the practice tests I have been taking. I really like this test because of the fact that a lot of the experts that they give for analysis are actually really interesting to interpret and are great works of literature:  Virtue George Herbert (1593-1633)  Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,      The bridal of the earth and sky; The dew shall weep thy fall tonight;      For thou must dies. Sweet rose, whose hue, angry and brave,      Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye: Thy root is ever in its grave,      And thou must die. Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,     A box where sweets compacted lie; My music shows ye have your closes,     And all must die. Only a sweet and virtuous soul,     Like seasoned timber, never gives; But though the whole world turn to coal,     Then chiefly lives.   Just a couple of questions for practice:)  The subject of the poem is: a) mortality, b) immortality, c) the beauty of nature, d) the impact of evil,      e) the essence of goodness.  The speaker conceives of the world as: a) ending in ashes, b) repeating the cycle of birth and death,       c) having the strength of "seasoned timber," d) eternal, e) being the secure dwelling of humanity  I am looking forward to frisbee tomorrow; I have to agree with Frank that sometimes it is just better to simply relax and take your mind off all the fidgeting and worries. By the way the answers to the questions are: e and c.

       All this death and gloom over the AP test, we all need some happiness... Well, okay, i'm no good at being happy, so here is some dark sarcasm. Good enough?   Bush To Iraqi Militants: 'Please Stop Bringing It On'  WASHINGTON, DC—In an internationally televised statement Monday, President Bush modified a July 2003 challenge to Iraqi militants attacking U.S. forces. "Terrorists, Saddam loyalists, and anti-American insurgents: Please stop bringing it on now," Bush said at a Monday press conference. "Nine months and 500 U.S. casualties ago, I may have invited y'all to bring it on, but as of today, I formally rescind that statement. I would officially like for you to step back." The president added that the "it" Iraqis should stop bringing includes gunfire, bombings, grenade attacks, and suicide missions of all types.  Props to the Onion for that little piece. My two cents on the AP test?    AHHHHH. Now, were did all those grammar/rhetorical thingy lists go to?  --Beck--

       I just took the collegeboard test and I have to agree that it is much, much easier than the one we took in class, at least my score went up by 10 points:) I agree that literary terms are crucial to know both for mult. choice and essays, but grammer is also really important, they have a few questions like:  lines ... contain which of the following?: a) elaborate metaphor b) parallel syntax c) a single periodic sentence d) a compound subject e) subordinate clauses I am currently looking through all the grammer packets Mrs. VA gave us in the beginning of the year. Yeah, I am kind of starting to feel a bit nervous already.  P.S. The evil that men do lives after them, the good is oft intered with their bones. (not sure if that's how it goes:)

       Friends, English Classmen, lend me your ears.  It is true what you say... the test is subjective, subtle, and DIFFICULT.  But you are more prepared than you think.  By now we can all write 9-caliber essays with the right inspiration, and the multiple choice is less perilous than you give it credit for.  The tests we've taken from the books are meant to trick you- beat you on a technicality and so forth.  So much so that the objective (I hope) is to get you to read the questions so closely, you don't get fooled on the test.  However, there is evidence for hope.  The test that I gave a link to in my last post, was a sample test written by the college board... after a 50% on the Peterson's test, I got an 80% on the real one... that's a huge improvement.  It's also great for confidence.  We can do this, class!!!  The best advice I can give is to know the literary terms like the back of your hand... what they are, how they're used, and how you can recognize them in a passage.  That's the heart of these questions, and if you can identify those terms, you will have success.  Love, Rob

       My only suggestion to those who want to "study" for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time.   I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays.   So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms.  My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word "object" (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that "dispute" and "argue" are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.

       To be perfectly honest, i dont really see how you can study for the AP test. I mean, of course you can review grammar and rhetorical strategies and how they effect one's writing, but i dont think it's worth getting overly stressed. Be confident in the knowledge you already have; we've all been preparing for this since the first day we signed up for AP -- just do you best. For me, I'm planning on going in on Monday with what I know...that's all we really can do. You know what you know, and as long as you try your best, that's all you can do. So dont stress out too bad. Just think, by noon on Monday, it will all be over!  Kailie

       I have to disagree Thomas.  The AP English test is definitely tough, but I don't think its the toughest.  While a lot of the multiple choice questions are subjective, the essays make up for it.  If you write good strong essays and support your points, you should (hopefully!) do well.  I think people just find the test to be hard because its not something you can memorize out of a book; its skills for recognizing rhetorical strategies and writing well that count.

       Ok maybe it's just me, but I would rank AP English tests the hardest tests.   The multiple choice questions on the AP English tests are harder than SAT passages (which i already did horribily), not only are we suppose to know the meanings of the passage, but exactly and thoroughly understand how authors wrote it and carefully constructed the passages.  There are several reasons for this ranking that puts English on the APEX of all AP tests:  1: The questions are the most subjective: Everytime when I take the AP English multiple choice tests, for every MC, I feel my hands sweat and my mind full of doubt when I bubble in an answer for that question. There is NEVER a single question that I can feel 100% confident on that I'm sure I got it right. Unlike all other subjects, including US history, where there is just some straightfoward concrete fact that's either right or wrong.  The meaning of every excerpt, sentence, even to the every word of the question can be interpreted in a variety of different ways. And as Chad mentioned today in class, that we are taught so much about how to infer, imply, that we sometimes forget the LITERAL MEANINGS, and we lose perspectives. In short, every question we can "Overthink" it.  And again being the subject of English, there is no fine line as to where is "overthinking", and where is "underthinking". To a point, it gets to be rather annoying, all the shakiness and uncertaintiness in answer EVERY SINGLE QUESTION.  2: When you get an answer wrong, and you read the explanations that explains why, you are never ever 100% convinced. There is always that self-righteous factor that comes to play that doubts the correct answers, simply because words and phrases can be interpreted differently in everybody's minds. Everytime I feel the urge to argue with whoever thought the right answer to a question is this letter, while two other letter of answers can probably be interpreted as correct.   3: For almost every other school subject, the teacher, the student, if he or she is willing to learn or improve, can easily identify the weak areas, which FACTS the student's missing and so on after some assessments......But for English, I just  know I'm not prepared for the test, and I know did bad on the practice ones, but still there is not some concrete evidences I can point out that here, this is my weak area, or this I really do not understand. So it becomes a matter of trial and error and practice, which seems limitless and endless.   And Finally, this is the most unique about the English test that's different than EVERY OTHER SUBJECT: ---- YOU CAN NOT CRAM AND STUDY FOR . Yeah it is right that after maybe several, maybe several dozens years of intense study.....You maybe say I'm fully prepared now for the AP english exam........And still the questions bombards you with subjectivity. And just the shear size of the vocabulary, the subtle difference between all the synonymous words, (overstatement, hyperbolie, implies, infers, suggests, what is the intent, argue, dispute...). And it's like your whole life of culture and experience in the world culminates and contributes to your performance on this test. Yeah for a really really stressed, miserably failing, troubled, an extremely unprepared and uncertained kid one weekend before he has to take the AP English language test, This test is just not the test to cram for.  All in all, AP English test in my feeling is just hard.......harder than every other test.   Unless you are Matt Wu of course.  I don't know if any of you share any of the feelings I listed above.   So there is my emotional turmoil of the day.  Thanks all to all of you who were willing to read this. Thomas Chen

       Hey, for those of you feeling stressed about the AP test next Monday as a result of some negative test scores on the Peterson's practice we took, there is a College Board written practice at   http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/sub_englang.html  You may have to download a new Acrobat reader, but this should be a slightly more accurate prediction of your success than the Devil's own instrument of torture; The Peterson Test.  Good luck to everyone on this practice test, remember to take it within the alotted time, it is good practice!  Love Rob

       Thomas, I totally agree with you that standardized tests are simply unfair/wrong since individuals are not standard. It seems like in America everything is about individuality and ability to strive and achieve, yet society still places standards upon us that we have to pass in order to be "good citizens." I'm myself very frustrated with SATs and ACTs cause no matter if I am “super smart,” or get 1st places in competitions, I am just bad in analogies and my vocab doesn't include such words as vituperative, or flabbergasted. I personally just came from the WASMUN competition where I was elected Best Negotiator, and Rapatour (I don't know how to spell that) and spoke in front of 600 "delegates," and yet all of that doesn't matter cause I still feel "not good enough" cause my awesome SAT scores place me into the "average/standard" herd of students.  Actually I think it's an awesome idea to encourage our fellow students to participate in conversations by addressing them directly, it really does work... sometimes. In our "committees" in MUN (yeah, I am a nerd like that) we can just say "I yield my time to ...." and name a delegate that seems to be the least awake; it mostly ends up that he/she has a lot to say and starts participating in the debate, or else you at least you wake them up… for a while:)   About the practice AP test we took, I find it to be the best preparation for the test we can get. I just want to know what I would actually have gotten if it was the real test. I found mult. choice test to be the hardest part of it (stand. tests), the essays were fine. The prompt about Emerson was interesting, especially since we have studied him and read his works; I didn't focus as much on conventions, except for the usage of simple/complex sentences and the "..." to communicate effectively. Shakespeare essay was awesome cause I just have read a lot of him and the prompt was pretty broad and open for interpretation. It helps a lot to have background info about prompts. Now I think we should just really focus on reviewing the literary terms and grammar, I have problems coming up with literary terms, and also some of the mult. choice questions on grammar need review. I think our class is well prepared, we all read and write a lot, and Mrs. VA covered grammar/terms pretty well.

       I feel this is a great article that everybody should read:  urlLink   Segregation no longer black and white New issues fifty years after Brown v. Board decision  It supports some educator's arguments that today's schools are actually as segregated or even more segregated than ever. Segregated for a variety of reasons: huge discrepancy of wealth, economic gap, culture differences, community separations, and continued racial problems and misunderstandings. This culturally, economically, and racially segregated school systems in turn shows up in the huge differences in the "standardized" testing scores. This problem really boggles those "No Child Left Behind" testing conformist's mind and is a threat to their "everybody conform to the same standard" ideology.  I would like to hear everyone's arguments and opinions on this issue.  Thomas Chen

       Mrs. VA,  I think trying to get more people involved in the discussions is a good idea.  However, knowing what it's like to be one of the ones that is not easily motivated to state my opinion during class, I feel that the best way would be to encourage the other students to try to bring the less responsive ones into the discussion.  Having a teacher pinpoint you in the middle of a discussion never seems to work too well. Throughout middle school and other classes many teachers have used that as a technique as a form of punishment for not paying attention, but for our class, many people are paying attention they just don't say as much.  Therefore if it's the other students it wont be as much of punishment, but should bring about more of a casual converstion which will allow everyone to feel more comfortable.

       As far as I know, Kailie Veys had the highest multiple choice score with an adjusted (incorrect guess penalty included) score of 23/43.  Sorry if I betrayed her trust in this, but I'm proud of her accomplishment.  On to class participation; I don't think bribing responses is the way to go.  Everyone comes out of their shell, some of us are fortunate to have expatriated earlier, but sometimes forcing someone to respond only delays their comfort.  The best possible scenario is to create an environment where the shy can feel that their thoughts and feelings will be appreciated.  Many people have expressed to me that what they have to say they don't feel other people want to hear; that their thoughts aren't on the same level as the "intellectuals"; that they feel stupid with what they have to say. While there isn't anything that can be done about those angsts, for those that don't feel confortable contributing; know that you needn't worry or feel judged.  Anything that can be contributed adds to the formation of other thoughts and truely helps a discussion.  Lastly; some of those questions in those Peterson tests are so damn frustrating and often times ridiculous.  There should never be a scenario where one must choose between "argue" and "dispute."  They're the same thing!!!  In history, the Fed either "raised interest rates" or "discouraged borrowing."  All the Fed does is control interest rates and inflation, so the answers are the same!!!  Traditionally, the practice tests are harder thant he actual tests.  For a potentially more accurate representation of your score, you can take old tests that were prepared by the college board, accessible at www.collegeboard.com.  Find the AP section, and we're taking AP Lang, not Lit, so be wary.  Once again, good luck on the test!  Love, Rob

       Mrs. VA, I absolutely agree that it's time to use some forceful means to rally everybody into sharing their ideas and speak up in class. That's actually a great idea actually of setting up a ground rule for everybody to speak, except that I'm not that kind of person who wants to jumpstart forcing other people to speak. But it would be nice for everybody in our class to finally break the "shyness" barrior.......after almost a whole year has gone by.  So for all you, please just start randomly question "Underrepresented" people "what do you think of this", or "what's your opinion on this issue".  I'm SURE everyone has great ideas to share, the "laziness", "uncertainty", and "shyness" are the only barriors.   In other news, third period would really like to know what was the highest grade on the English AP practice test multiple choice section in first period? Somehow almost every member of third period has a feeling that first period is "smarter" and engages in better discussions that us.   Don't be shy to share your comments now :)  Thomas Chen

       Hello!  I'm so pleased to see you all carrying on such a lively conversation; you're informed, you're responding to each other, and you're connecting all kinds of ideas and subjects.  Literature leads to culture, which leads to politics, which leads to a need to communicate civilly, which leads back to writing and literature.  Truly, you folks are the kinds of students teachers dream of when they first go into teaching.  I also appreciate your feedback about what is happening in class.  Concerning discussion...this has come up before.  Those of you who are participating feel like we are in a rut, as if you are dragging many unwilling--or unresponsive--bodies along with you.  Speakers and non-speakers become entrenched in their roles, and soon, class is predictable.  Boring.  So why have I allowed this?  Part of my role as a teacher is to facilitate, to push students to do what they would not be willing to do on their own.  I have a preferred style, though, that is based on respect of students' choices.  I find it very difficult to make a person speak if he or she is not willing.  Why?  Some people are painfully shy, and to be made to speak causes that student to suffer.  I would like class conversation to work like it does at a good dinner party, where people speak because they are interested and engaged.  I give all of you prep work, and I make the assumption that if you have done the work, you have the tools to speak.  And I expect you to be motivated enough--courageous enough--to conquer fear of a large room and state your opinion.  Perhaps this is idealistic of me, yet this is what democracy depends upon.    In the way we have a large group of silent people, our class is echoing a societal trend. Small numbers of people bother to get out and vote; small numbers of people in class participate in discussion.  What do we do?  I could be an autocrat and put people on the spot, giving "points" to those who have an anwer.  Is this the role of a teacher?  Is this what you want class to look like?  Feel like?  Do you want speaking aloud to be connected to rewards and punishments?  To take this analogy further, should we somehow punish people who choose to avoid their responsibilities as US citizens?  Dock their pay if they don't vote? The classroom is a special place, though.  It wasn't until extra credit was offered that any of you chose to participate in the blog.  So what to do? When leaders are organizing activities, one of the things they know to do is to invite specific individuals to participate in the group.  All of you who participate in this blog participate in class, also.  By speaking aloud, others will see you as class leaders.  If you want to maintain a democratic classroom, where students feel like equals and I am not treating you all as minions, what if you were to start inviting other students to respond?  Why should I be the one to ask questions, just because I am the teacher?  Don't you all ask questions of each other when you are in small groups? What if you start doing this in a large group?  Who do you want to hear from?  Ask that person a question, draw them in.  What kind of encouragement/lessons/announcements (if any) do you need from me to help you take a more active role in making discussion work?  I have been in classes before where one of the ground rules for discussion is that no one in the room may make more than 2 comments until everyone has been invited to share something with the large group.  We could do this if you'd like.  It can feel contrived; however, if you want to change the dynamic of class, this is a system that can help encourage change.    What do you think?

       Yeah I can finally blog, Ryan I too am a rookie at this. It was so nice to go outside today instead of look at another essay. I feel that occasionally a break from strenuous study adds to your understanding of whatever your studying. I found this to be true when I was reading Thoreau (WOW that was a long time ago) and I practice this regularly. I don't know if that is a good or a bad habit. I wanted to test out the waters of blogging and I have, so Good Night!   ~ Frank

       I was dreading taking the practice AP english test all week, anticipating the worst possible three hours, or coming really close to having to take the french one.  However, after taking it today it wasn't as bad as I had thought. The multiple choice part wasn't too bad but I tend to take too much time reading and rereading... oh well.  The essays weren't extremely difficult either, and amazingly i finished all of them, even with a conclusion.  However the second one where we had to discuss how Emerson used the English language and conventions was a little more difficult.  Also, like it was said earlier, I noticed that Shakespeare was used and I found that to be odd considering he wasnt American, which is what we have been studying all year.

       There were a few obscurites in the multiple choice section..never felt overwhelmed though, and finished in plenty of time.  By the way, did anyone notice how I used an elipsis instead of transition words there?  Basically, that's how I responded to the Emerson prompt.  Picked one or two conventions that seemed blatantly obvious, and beat them till they died, then beat them some more.  I can't tell if I was too redundant or not, but the familiarity with the author DEFINITELY eased the pain.  It made reading the passage go much smoother, and I felt not bad about it overall.  I was suprised at the Shakespeare prompt because it was so vast and wide, not really what I'm used to.  It also suprised me that it asked for Shakespeare (which I remembered enough of to respond), because he's super old and not American.  Overall I feel confident (more so after some grammar review), but this will not be my most difficult test.  Good luck to everyone!  Love, Rob

       Hey, how did everyone think of that practice AP multiple choice/three essays practice test we took? how do you think you are prepared? Any comments/feelings/complaints/sorrows/anger/stress/suggestions/questions about the AP English test?  To me personally, the multiple choice section was harder than the free response section (Still a lot of interpretations, confusions, and ambiguities in the multiple choice answers). And within the free-response essays, i felt that the one about the English conventions/language was the hardest, although since the passage was about Emerson, the familiarity of the author kind of comforted me a little. It was weird talking about how Emerson persuades the reader his opinions with the use of "conventions", such things as grammar, the parts of English language that I tend to ignore its importance. Yeah so overall, that was a challenging piece to write as the essay prompt demanded "a well reasoned and organized essay".  But other than that, I liked the free-free response essay that we can draw on our own experiences, readings, and observations for that last essay. It wasn't so strict as to just interpret a small piece of passage..   Please do respond with your opinions on the AP english practice test.   Thomas Chen

       O Paul! I read the Da Vinci Code! It's a GREAT book. I recommend it to everyone. The different hidden symbols found in the artwork and the secret organization of the Priory of Sion is just so interesting. However if you do read it I recommend you go online and look at some of the paintings discussed in the book. This will give you a good visual of what's described in the book. It's very entertaining and it allows you to explore new ideas. It's also fun to try to solve the different puzzels throughout the book.

       About third period being soo quiet, I think it's almost become a routine that others don't notice or don't care anymore. I know some people are just lazy, and believe me, third period just seems to drag on forever, but I think some also feel intimidated.  Everyone, well the only five or so people that actually talk always have really good ideas and are usually really smart, so others, including me, only think of the obvious when it comes to most of our discussions.  So either you don't want to state the obvious or someone else says it before you get the chance.  This has resulted that now when Ms. VA asks us all a question that no one really understands everyone leaves it up to the same people who always find a response that fits what she is looking for.  If people know they can get away without having to say anything during a discussion they will probably stay that way for the rest of the year, so unfortunately it seems that the same people will lead the discussions once more, unless something drastic changes.

       I would just like to make a comment in general.  I don't know if first period is the same, but our third period class really bums me out sometimes.  I am pretty vocal in class (I need to shut up sometimes) but honestly a lot of the time I end up raising my hand and commenting because so few people do!  Our class discussions consist of about five people talking, and everyone else just sitting there, and I think it would be really nice for everyone to get involved.  Just sharing a thought...

       Paul we're both too worried about our images.  Maybe we didn't need to apologize, but we'll just chalk it up to dignity and chivalry.  Even if our politics don't see eye to eye, we agree on the worth of the New York Times.  The NYT (as it is known by those IN the know) posts its articles online without a monetary fee of any kind, all they ask for is your e-mail.  If you want, The NYT will send you the morning headlines on the subjects that interest you (business, politics, international, sports, etc.) with links to their articles, but more on that later.    I haven't read DaVinci code, but I'm damn interested.  Copies are flying off the shelves, and I'm all for a nonstop read (I've read every Harry Potter book but the last one atleast 3 times, and I'm not ashamed to admit it).  For something shorter and tied to "Night," a town in Italy is attempting to convict several former Nazi SS members (a story I got through the free NYT e-mail headline service).  You can read about it here; http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/international/europe/18TUSC.html?th .  I have my opinions, but didn't read "Night," so I'd like it if someone else gave theirs.  I'm posting this on Miss Clark's blog as well, so if you have her for a teacher she feels neglected because her blog doesn't get this kind of action.  I'd also like other viewpoints on the issues and differences in opinions Paul and I worked ourselves through.  I'd enjoy this to be a political forum, and I know you all have something to say on the world as is today.  Love, Rob

       I feel I came off as too defensive.  I really don't mind anything political getting posted here, I just feel... obliged to post my rebuttal wherever it's relevant.  That being said, you really don't have to 'clarify yourself in a dignified manner'  I felt your original post, even if meant for Thomas' rather less tame personal blog, was fine and no personal slight at my personal politics at all.  I guess I was just on a defensive republican bent that night, probably worrying about Kerry's successful poll numbers:-)  So I guess I'm apologizing for sounding like a bitchy little republican, you really have no reason to apologize, clarification is often a must in debate but I really don't think you said anything out of line or offensive to me.  So to steer the conversation anyway in a different direction....  Who's read the Da Vinci code here?  I started reading it yesterday and really can't put it down.  There's nothing particularly wonderful or interesting in the prose, but I find the storytelling and suspense to be excellent, as well as the subject matter.

       Paul, your arguments were effective, logical, and I respect them.  While this isn't an excuse for anything I stated, the post was meant to go to Thomas Chen's personal blog, but I'm on three of them, and all the post screens look the same except for a small titleline in the top right corner, and I accidentally posted it on this one.  Anyway, the first half of this is an apology for the crude, unpolished, vulgar post from before.  This is not characteristic of me, as my previous posts (I hope) convey.  Back to the issue at hand...    I'll sum up the previous post in a more formal language; There is an element of monarchy (in both Democratic AND Republican parties) in that there is a lineage of elitists that are pedigreed to run the country, and that these families become separated from many of the realities of Joe American, which I believe manifests itself in the use of American soldiers as expendable tools.  John Kerry was one of these expendables, and as far is foreign policy is concerned, could draw from his personal experiences, which were perilous no matter what that article implied (Don't try to tell me that having a rocket shot at your boat doesn't deserve an award if you are the commander, as well as going after the shooter who could very well have been able to defend himself with another, closer-range firearm.  And don't forget the Oregon vet's story that was so popular on the campaign trail, and that may have been Kerry's push over Dean.  And demeaning the Purple-Hearts is also a joke... as if it was his obligation to reject them???  But I've digressed).  Back to the issue; a man who knows the detriments and personal losses of war would be more hesitant to thrust the volunteer (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMDs) soldiers (How many soldiers do you believe volunteered to fight for Sadam's phantom WMD's) into a frivolous war.  Point 2.  I believe Bush's war against Iraq is entirely a farce with negative short term and long term affects.  The short-term affects is the death toll that grows daily.  Long term affects are more anti-American senitiments that take a death toll and add hundreds or thousands in a single day (9/11, USS Cole, embassy bombings).  If a regime change is the goal, don't lie about it, but as of now Bush is using American men and women to fight for oil, which is necessary to accomodate America's mass automotive transportation.  And reflecting current consumer trends and the pressure on Bush to secure American jobs (ridiculous amounts of which outsourced by GM to Mexico), more gas is needed to satisfy the throats of gas-chugging SUV's, trucks, and to a lesser extent, vans; in all of said categories American companies generally control the market.  If gas gets too expensive, American cars depreciate in a hurry and sales numbers go down, resulting in more GM/Daimler Chrysler layoffs.  I'm entirely aware that Japanese car companies have success in this country for a variety of reasons, which I understand to be largely affordability, dependability, and gas mileage.   GM is one of the largest companies in America, and rather than allow the pressure from another market to create a need for quality improvement, Bush's actions act in giving American motor companies too much room for error.  The last point that a gas tax would emphasize fuel-efficiency, environmental protection, and reduce accidents is largely unarguable.  If you disagree with the principal of taxes, that's your opinion, but let me point out that Andrew Sullivan, the author of the article that brought the issue to my attention, is a REPUBLICAN.  Not that a Democrat wouldn't support it, but take care when you go throwing around those increasingly meaningless slanders such as "liberal and conservative."  I hope I have clarified myself in a somewhat dignified manner.  If I missed something, you have further questions, or just plain disagree, please post a response.  One more apology for accidentally posting a private on a public, I will be sure to take more care in the future.  Love, Rob

       I really don't have much to say about AP tests or ASB elections... but politics---  If military experience was a prerequisite for being a successful President or commander in chief of the armed forces I'd fear for the future of this country.  And I'd hardly compare Kerry to true war heroes such as Audy Murphy, here's a section of an article describing Kerry's Vietnam medals and tour.  But neither of those matter, the bottom line is, when you enlist in the military you are enlisting in the military.  You job is to be ready for war.  In war you are put in harms way.  Everyone in Iraq right now knew what they were getting into, we have a volunteer military.  The loss of every life, especially the civilian ones, is a great trajedy, the real issue is should we even be in Iraq, but that's a whole other issue.-     Kerry served on swift boats for about four months. During that time, he was awarded the Bronze Star (the lowest decoration for heroism in combat) and the Silver Star (the next higher decoration for valor) and three Purple Hearts for wounds sustained in battle. These latter decorations — like my title of "nationally syndicated columnist" — sound more impressive than they are. All three wounds were minor cuts from shrapnel, which, according to Kerry, caused him to miss a grand total of 2 days of duty.   For soldiers and Marines, especially of the enlisted variety, a Silver Star is a big deal. You've got to do something profound to get one. But the rules were different for officers, especially for naval officers.   This is the action on Feb. 28, 1969, for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star: A Viet Cong fired a B-40 rocket at Kerry's boat, Patrol Craft Fast-94. Tom Belodeau, manning the twin 50-caliber machine guns at the rear of the boat, opened fire on the VC, wounding him. The VC fled behind a hooch. Kerry ordered PCF-94 to shore, leaped out of the boat, pursued the VC, and finished him off.   I can envision grizzled infantrymen shaking their heads. "He got the Silver Star for that?"   Kerry had an advantage most servicemen do not. Medal recommendations have to be made by the commanding officer of the unit in which the heroism took place. Kerry was the commander of PCF-94. Presumably, Kerry's medal recommendation was made by the commander of the squadron to which PCF-94 belonged. But Kerry's commander wasn't there. The evidence he had of the heroism of Lt (jg) John F. Kerry came chiefly from the after action report of Lt. (jg) John F. Kerry.   Shortly after being awarded the Silver Star, Kerry took advantage of a provision in Navy regulations that permits a sailor who has been wounded three times to obtain early release from his combat tour. For Kerry — since his wounds were so minor — this was taking advantage of a technicality. There is nothing wrong with this. Many officers similarly situated would have done the same. But it wasn't heroic.   To recap: Kerry was a double volunteer. As a swift boat commander, he was brave and able. But I am unaware of any soldier or Marine who was awarded a decoration of any kind — much less the Silver Star — just for killing a wounded man who was running away.   Though it is being hyped far beyond what it warrants, Kerry's Vietnam service was honorable. What is not honorable is the way Kerry — in testimony before Congress in April, 1971 — falsely accused his fellow Viet vets of routinely committing grisly war crimes. Nor does it speak well of Kerry that in several demonstrations he marched under the flag of the Viet Cong. It is one thing to oppose the war in Vietnam. It is another to cheer for the enemy.     Why is there hope in John Kerry?  If the major issue with the president choosing to send troops to war, because of the evils of war, then no President since maybe Gerald Ford(I'm just guessing) would fit your criteria.  I find it hard to believe President Bush is as cold and heartless as he is portrayed to be here.  I really doubt he's any different than any other President, I'd just like to say that character slander is not an effective means of policy debate which is what is truly at debate here.  Tell me why Kerry won't be bought because his wife has billions?  Kerry is already bought, he's bought because he wants to win.  You can't buy votes with billions but you can buy votes with endorsements.  Kerry's wife is rich, yes, so she can fund his campaign along with George Soros.  But Kerry is already bought by the standard democratic special interest groups, labor unions, environmentalists, trial lawyers(by far the worst) because he hopes their endorsements will entice members of their groups to vote for him.  In exchange for those endorsements he agrees to give them more sway in his administration, it's just how the system works.  It would be nice if everyone looked out for everyone and the common good but that's not going to happen.  All politics are corrupt, Democrats and Republicans equally.  I agree completely that we went to Iraq for oil, and I don't think we should be there.  I certainly understand the benefits of securing a new nation under our sway in the middle east, removal of bases to Iraq from Saudi Arabia would certainly quell some anti American sentiment in that nation and put our bases closer to Israel.  OPEC has too much power over the United States economy and the global economy, but setting a precedent of a preemptive strikes frightens me.  Nothing would make me happier to see the US freed from oil, and the Bush administration has done an admirable job of using tax credits to push ahead gas/electric hybrids and to cut oil usage, such as in new federal requirements tying fuel efficiency requirements to vehicle weight.  The single issue of gas prices is not what gives the Japanese car makers the edge, it's a rather unique combination of luck, trade policies and union interference that has put detroit second to tokyo as of recently.  But this years trends from detroit have been towards cars, while some from Tokyo, most notably Nissan and Honda have certainly been to expand into less fuel efficient vehicles such as SUVs and trucks.  It's impossible to generalize on such as level or attribute it to something as arbitrary as gasoline prices.   Rob's suggestion of putting a 1 dollar tax on gas is why I'm not a democratic supporter as a general rule.  Liberal policies dictates a negative approach to social engineering.  Why not offer an incentive, a tax break on buying a gas efficient car or a hybrid.  Democratic ethos dictates, RAISE TAXES.  Push people away from gas, not try to entice them away.  The federal government is simply too inefficient and bureaucratic to justify it taking any more tax money from the private sector.  Democrats want to take it away more so than Republicans, but they both want it.  Lesser of two evils.  I guess that's a rather sad commentary on my approach to politics and maybe our system in general but I digress.  Read the New York Times at www.nytimes.com even if it's a liberal rag it still beats the pants off the Columbian and Oregonian combined.

       I would actually vote you for ASB president, believe it or not. And I would take on the responsibility of an ASB selected position if I can get my .5 credits of PE waived. I will already have five AP classes next year, and if the PE department won't be like a bigot like they usually do, I could manage my sixth period a leadership class. But if they become a usual royal pain in the ass, (Yeah they think PE is so much harder and more important than AP Literature or AP Physics) then I will have to resort to my last resort, and that is, to take all SIX AP classes.  But anyways, a new book just came out on Bush's secret plan to invade Iraq right when the invasion of Afghanistan started. The book is called "Plan of Attack" by Bob Woodward.  Peace out, and let's all have a moment of silence for all the innocent soldiers killed in Iraq.  Thomas Chen

       Stress is right...thank GOD for the weekend.  I'm taking three ap tests which will sound infantile and scoffable next to Tom's FIVE or so, but I'm working on Prom day and night.  Laugh if you want for me expending so much time and effort perpetuating a night of drunkeness and morally relaxed practices, I sometimes shake my head myself, but it's what I signed up for and it's hard and stressful.  Go to prom and appreciate my hard work damn it!  Any way... it sickens me that the people that send others to their death a.ka. the Bush administration, do so without feeling the pain so many American families do when they lose a brother/mother/father/sister/friend/lover/fellow blogger in Iraq.  Bush's connection with the world has been GENETICALLY REMOVED.  Whether like to think of it or not, we elect monarchies.  W. Bush is something like the great great great great nephew of Madison or something.  There's no difficulty tracing a Kennedy bloodline either.  There is hope in Kerry.  He opted to fight in Vietnam rather than lynch himself over a balcony, and his experiences there gave him credibility teaching (what should be the obvious) wrongs of war.  His wife has billions, so don't expect him to be bought, and he doesn't claim his greatest mistake was TRADING SAMMIE FUCKING SOSA.  The dumbass Bush couldn't run a major league baseball team successfully, but we gave him the country!?!?  Edwards was the best answer, but he was too decent to sling mud, so Kerry it is.  I think it's obvious we went to Iraq for oil, becaue Iraq isn't/never was a threat to the security of the u.s. (North Korea is however) and the war has done nothing but stimulate enrollment for Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, and other groups hell-bent on making their suicide hurt anyone that's not Muslim.  Bush and Cheney are both oil-men (duh) and they're sick of having their balls in opec's vice, so they want to secure an oil flow.  How bout eliminating the need for oil?  Andrew Sullivan wrote a thought-provoking essay supporting the case for a gas tax of $1 per gallon.  It's what the rest of the world does, and it would result in a trend toward fuel-efficient cars, cut down on polution, and get many people off the road-reducing accident rates and deaths.  Bush won't do it though... it would give Japanese carmakers too much of an edge, and right now GM is pumping out SUV's as fast as bunnies are pump out kittens.  By the way, I'm going to run for ASB president next year, and I want to see some representation from the bloggers that post on this site.  Elias, Tom, Pav, et al. if you have schedule room, uncle sam wants YOU!  Help to keep the ASB diversified.  And if Alex R. still wants to talk shit bout Evan Cate, shame on him... I've been sitting on this for a while, but Evan is one of the most honest, genuine kids I know, and I'm glad he's my friend.  I'm out- talk back.  And if nonconformity becomes too popular, conform to nonconform.  Love Rob

       Thomas - I agree with you absolutely that individualism is absolutely great and that America is truly a country of immense opportunities.  But I think too many people in this country tend to look up to their heros who dared to be individuals, yet simply stay satisfied and happy that someone else represents them so well and that they can get by, by simply idolizing these heroes. Maybe its not right to say this, but there are too many people that look like blind, brainless cattle that has to be guided and taken care of. Not just in our school, or just in America, but everywhere I have been. I work as a teller and see many people come in during the day, but there are only a few faces that I recognize when they come back, becuase these faces have something special about them, like a special radiating energy of being different. Yet, I believe in a "friendly individualism," where people are not simply egoistic and competing, but where they help others and modivate people around them to develope their own individuality.  Rob - I think American culture as a whole seems to tend to idealize and make everything seem heroic. I just think that there are way too many controversies in American history and literature: Jefferson, freedom and slaves; WWII, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima & Nagasaki; Freedom, civil rights and gay marriages; the only thing that seems to go hand in hand is Bush and his idiotism (no offence to anyone).

       I'd have to agree with Natalya on the theme of Self-Reliance and individualism is one UNIQUE theme to American literature and Americans. This is probably the only time I will appear as an American egotistical bigot. But I truely believe that America is a country founded on progressive beliefs, reforming individuals, and revolutionary ideas. Famous Americans of the past had always had an urge for freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and freedom of THINKING. The famous American authors of the past: from founding fathers Jefferson, Franklin, Paine, to Transcendentalists Emerson, Thoreau, to poets Whitman, Dickinson, to realist writers Mark Twain, Faulkner, to muckrackers Tarbell, Steffens and to civil rights activist MLK; they all inspire Americans with the vivid themes of individualism and the interaction between the individual and the society. Many of them of course were all considered radicals just because of their progressive ideas. But they are some of the most brilliant Americans. All of them wanted to, and they did, forever change America for the better. Seriously, in comparison, Chinese classical literature is all about the art of war and at the same time harmony with nature (juxtaposed against each other), and respecting elders, and conforming to society (which of course, many of you know I abhor). Yeah the theme of individualism is a farfetch idea in most of the world.  To truely live up to the American ideal, I believe American citizens have to always strive for the theme of believe in one self, and strive for individual rights, and find one's unique place in the society.  It's when people stop thinking about American literature with the theme of individualism, self reliance, and self-expression, that causes me frustrated. When people stop using brain and thinking about the society with their own unique point of view, and let others make judgements for them, and blindly conforms to the mainstream society, then they've lost the integral value of American individualism. Losing one's unique place in the society fundamentally degrades the morals of human beings, and dictators dreams to have a society of dumb people that blindly conforms to the society. I don't believe that's what America, the land of opportunity, is all about.  Thus................Always think for yourself, and always question all authority.   As always, I welcome all dissagreements (P.S. Dissagreeing is also one element of American individualism).   Thomas Chen.

       Paul, thanks for bringing up the nature of other categories of national literature.  Last year we had a much more cosmopolitan curriculum, and thinking back to Dr. Zhivago, I have to agree with Natalya on the desolation that Pasternak wrote about.  We read about Okonkwo too, and the let down he obviously felt when his tribe was weakening.  We also have read some western European novels and essays- Tale of Two Cities, All Quiet on the Western Front, et al.  Tale of Two Cities was really a political observation where personal relationships just worked themselves out, and All Quiet addressed the feeling of hopelessness war carries.  America truly is unique that it hasn't had to experience the despariging wars (other than Civil War) that Europe and Asia have dealt with, and that's the best evidence I can uncover to explain the difference in literary themes.  Many people in the world view Americans as arrogant and possessing other undesirable characteristics.  Does the attitude that we can do it on our own come through in the lit?  Or do Americans just lust for heros?  I find this all very interesting.  Maybe Tristan will tell me what I want to hear.  Shifting gears, what did you all think of the in-class essay today?  I enjoyed it, but being a dick, I could swear that passage came out of Disability.  No matter how strong Mairs portrays herself, you can still see her pain in the words she uses.  Lastly, in his press conference, Bush claimed he couldn't think of a mistake he's made in office.  You have to respect the guy a smidge for believing in himself, but I'd like to make a list of mistakes he's made.  Ignoring all his verbal blunders, I'll start the list off with the suggestion that Saddam and Al Qaeda were linked, last time I checked it was a lie, and it got Clinton impeached (which he deserved).  If anyone's got an item to add, please post it.  Love Rob

       NIGHT.  A very compelling read.   But since everyone is talking about their books on here I thought I would mix it up a bit.......and give some references to music.  First of all, Im sure there are people out there with different tastes in music......I myself prefer a mix of alternative, rap, and classic rock.  Sorry I'm not an Enya fan.  First of all I would like to make the recommendation that by sigining up at Yahoo Music, you can create your own radio station that plays almost every genre, customized to your own style.  This is free and is VERY useful when I get sick of all the stuff that is played on the radio or on CD's.  But anyways......a few recommendations.....for a pop type of CD I would recommend Hoobastanks new CD, listen to "The Reason" or "Lucky".   I classic rock CD I would recommend would be the Red Hot Chili Peppers greatest Hits or anything by the Beatles(can't really go wrong with the Beatles)  A rap selection...lets see....Kayne West or Twista seem to be two of the most popular at the time but a solid choice would be Jay-Z's Black Album.....Jay-Z's last album.  If you are into the same music of me.....I would recommend anything by 3 Doors Down or the Goo Goo Dolls.....very solid choices in those albums.  Anyways, just thought I would mix up the blog with a little culture.  -Pat

       Beck- I absolutely love you, no seriously, it's like you have been reading my mind, only you are way better in expressing it. I agree that it's funny how we worry about the least important things every day, and if you look at the big picture our lives so unimportant, they can be simply compared to that pile of ants, each ant is so small and what he does is so small, and yet I am sure he thinks that what he is doing is important. I mean, 4 children die every hour from malnutrition... strange, I have been reading Biology for the past hour... 4 children just died... do I feel anything? No. Can I even comprehend the fact that 4 innocent lives just died? Not really. I was watching the news today and they were talking about one of the Italian hostages being killed in Iraq, and I remember thinking: they make such a big deal out of this one death when at the same time there are hundreds, thousands of people dying every day. I think it's simply because we have gotten used to these statistics of how many people are dying in Africa from AIDS and how many have died during the Holocaust.  The horror simply gets saturated and you get used to it, and that's how saw Wiesel's experience as his story extended in the book: the first time he saw babies been thrown into the flames of crematory his reaction was " How could it be possible for them to burn people, children, and for the world to keep silent? No, none of this could be true. It was a nightmare...," compared to the reaction of when his father is taken away to the crematory "I did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I had no more tears. And, in the depth of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched it, I might perhaps have found something like - free at last!" I have heard from many people about Night and everyone said that they cried whenever they read it, but strangely the first time I read the book I didn't shed a tear. I have read many books like this one, I cried reading "The Pianist," and "All Quiet on the W. Front," even "Of Mice and Men" but this one was dry, it felt as if Wiesel was simply stating facts and these facts have been already known and there was simply too much of it and too hard to believe that such things could be true, too saturated with horror.   Paul - it does feel like self-reliance is much more prominent in American literature than in any other. At least drawing on what I know about Russian literature that's the feeling I get. I read A LOT of Russian novels and most have this trend of sorrow, grief and disillusionment with the people and world around, maybe that's why Russians tend to be so "mean," cynical and full or sarcasm. But I think Russian authors are great on analyzing human nature, and our lonely desolate souls; read "Crime and Punishment."  Ryan- you know it's funny how in America everyone simply stands up for himself and takes care of his own private business, but that does leave us lonely and without friends or anyone to talk to. George has to get rid of his burden too in order to be able to go on, but does he need the farm, now that he doesn't have his friend to share it with? Does the old man, Candy, want to go on, now that he lost his dog, his only friend? I think self-reliance and independence are over-rated.

       Going off of Ryan Elliot's post, the theme of loneliness struck me the most when I read 'Of Mice and Men.' The old man who lost he dog is so frightened of being all alone for the rest of his life that he still wants to join George and Lennie's dream farm even after Lennie kills Curley's wife. Also I think that Curley's wife is one of the loneliest people in the novel. I think the thing she wants the most is a friend and someone to talk to. She's so lonely that she tries too hard to be liked by all the farmhands thus becoming unpleasant to be around. She dislikes her husband and she doesn't know who to turn to. Lennie is the only person who will talk to her. However, it's also Lennie who ends up killing her.  On a side note I think Paul's post was really interesting about self reliance being more of a human concept in our literature.   I think it would be nice to "live on the fatta and lan."  :)

       Amazing what extra credit will do for a blog, won't it;-)  I never really have much to say anymore, but I know our whole theme this year has been self reliance in American literature.  If self reliance is American literature, what's British literature, or French literature or Russian literature or Chinese literature.  I'm simply curious as to if it's really uniquely American, or more a human concept in our literature.  As for turning the blog political, I say go for it, I just wish I had more time to frequently check in here.

       I'm really liking the fact that so many people are posting.  There are a lot of good ideas generated in each mind/group/class period, and I'm really enjoying reading them so keep it up!  (Beck, your post was especially eloquent)  Today in class, (M&M) discussion seemed especially productive in my group, and I thought we came up with a really thought-provoking level 3 q.  Lennie and George rely on each other for various reasons; does their relationship signify a shift in American Literature AWAY from self-reliance?  I think it's quite interesting because since Emerson and Franklin to Huck Finn, there has always been that underlying theme.  The suggestion that Lennie and George can be viewed as one entity and are self-reliant in that way was one way of countering the question, but has anyone read anything to suggest that there is a paradigm shift in American Lit?  What events could be triggering this shift?  Post your thoughts, and anything else you'd like to say... I'd like this blog to become somewhat of a politcal/current events forum as well, because I like to argue.  Love Rob

       I wasn't so excited to start reading these books, but I had heard that Of Mice and Men was an excellent book.  It is very intersting to see how Steinbeck shows how much these two men resemble people in a family.  I relate this a lot to myself, I see Lennie as my brother who has some difficulties and challenges, and me as George.  Sometimes I get real fed up with him, and extremely annoyed, and I do things like George that then tend to hurt his feelings, make me feel bad and then apologize and make it up to him.  My brother is also big like Lennie, and if anyone else trys to take advandtage of him or make fun of him, it ticks me off.  The same thing is with George, no one else can do anything to Lennie except him.  I like the way Steinbeck uses a lot of sentence manipulation so you can get a real grip of the attitude the characters have espcecially Lennie, it really helps the reader get into the book more.

            In a discussion about "Of Mice and Men" our group observed that George and Lennie's mutualistic friendship creates a theme of interdependence, which differs from the popular theme of self-reliance of the past semester.  The works of Emerson, Thoreau, and Franklin represent the fruits of solitude, and promote the benefits of self-sufficiency.  In contrast, Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" shows the loneliness of seclusion and explains how interpersonal relationships are necessary in leading a fulfilled life.  When George and Lennie arrive at the ranch they are hired to farm, their bond surprises a well respected ranchhand named Slim.  George takes exception to Slim's reaction and Slim explains there aren't "many guys who travel around together...maybe ever'body in the whole damn world is scared of each other."  Slim and the some of the other workers are envious and almost admire the friendship George and Lennie share.  Their relationship enables them to divide the stress of work and travel, as opposed to bearing it individually.  As the novel progresses the theme of mutualism stretches to recruit other characters.  Candy, an old, one-handed swamper, loses his dog to old age and sees lonely, desolate days ahead of him.  This depresses him and he spends most of his time staring at the wall of his bunk.  Crooks, the negro stable buck, isn't allowed to play cards with the guys, and is forced to sleep in a solitary room away from his peers.  Time eats away at these friendless men because as Crooks put it, "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got nobody."  Although self-reliance produces independence and pride within a man, it cannot pat him on the back, play a game of cards, or swap stories the way a friend can.  Living as an equal in the world is an inherent human goal, and to sacrifice societal equality for isolation produces a burning loneliness that must be tempered with humanity.    A few thoughts- Ryan Elliott

       Like many others, after today's small group discussion I have new thoughts on the book Night.  My group spent much of the period analyzing what the main theme of the book was and we came to two conclusions.  The first theme that we noticed was the naive/optimistic attitude the Jews had towards the Germans and the treatment they would receive in the events that led up to being sent to Auschwitz.(sp?)  The basis behind this theme most likely comes from the strong faith Jews had in God at this time period.  Even after being sent to the concentration and experiencing the cruel treatment of the Germans, Jews still had an optimistic view stating "God must be testing us."  Although Weisel himself begins to lose faith in God, many Jews still believed God was "just testing them."    The second theme my group noticed was individualism in the concentration camps.  Because the happenings at Auschwitz are so horrible, they begin to mold the spirit of many of the prisoners, Wielsel in particular.  This theme is best shown when Wiesel's father is being beaten severely by a crazed guard.  Instead of Wiesel becoming angry toward the guard, he instead is angry at his father for getting in the guards way.  Wiesel, like many others, lose their ties with family and friends in an effort to "fend for themselves" at the concentration camps.   These are the two most prominent themes my group saw in the book, are we missing a big one?  -Pat

        During the group descussions today in class, my group noticed something very interesting. I don't know where i'm going to go with it, but i thought i might throw it out there anyway. Our group was talking about Night, and we were busy discussing how horrific/depressing the book is when we heard a neighboring group mention how someone in the other book had lost his pet mouse and therefore all the joy in his world. We went kind of silent for a minute and looked at each other. How does a mouse compare to the Halocaust? And then we just went back to our discussion.   But i've been stuck on it all day, and i think that our reaction has as much to say as the juxtoposition of the books does. And i think that it all has something to do with the human ability to completely ingore huge, world changing events (or the inability to understand them), like the halocaust. I'll let the great Eddie Izzard make the next point:   "Pulpot killed 1.7 million people, we can't even deal with that. I think we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prision. If you kill 10 people, you to to Texas, they hit you with a brick. That's what they do. Twenty people, you go to a hospital, they look at you through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Somebody's killed one hundred thousand people, we're almost going, 'well done! well done, you killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down to the gym.' ...So i suppose we're glad that Pulpot's under house arrest, at least we know where he is. Just don't go in that house, you know?"   Some people would probably say that we find little ways to deal with huge or horrible things ...like pet mice. But i think that we just completley ignore them. A revolution in Haiti? Ten thousand citizens dead in Iraq? Ariel Sharon pulls out of the West Bank? Terrorists attack Madrid? Oh. Okay. ...Did i leave the iron plugged in? God, my boyfriend's being so annoying these days. Do i look fat in this shirt?... Nevermind the 25 million people that die every year from hunger. Or the 34.3 million people who are looking a little skinny since they contracted AIDS.   I'm not suggesting that we should think about this all the time every day, but it is valuable to be reminded every now and then.   So yeah... I'd put some sort of conlcusion on this... but it'd be way easier if people posted responses (seeing as you all completely ignored my last post) that i could then steal ideas from.  -Beck

       I just have to mention the observation that as if 7:02 April 13th, we have two distinct ads on top JUXTAPOSED to each other. One about "supporting the loving conservative BUSH administration", and the other "Support Anti-War movement". Kind of hilarious. Yeah if you haven't figured out, Google (the owner of blogger), periodically "reads" your blogs and accordingly put appropriate banner ads on top. So our posts about drafts, holocaust probably caused google to put those ads up.  And Megan, that quote there from Night is really insightful. Especially the part of "if we forget, we are guilty". (That's why history, historiography, and historical literature is so important). And finally Rob, to bring up that draft thing into perspective, it was actually two democrats who first initiated the plan. They think it would "democratize" the army system. Because they think it's not fair for a special group of people to fight. And of course many many Republicans support their plans, it helps them win their ambition of occupying Iraq. But yeah, there is some level of extremely scary muti-partisan support of the draft in the congress right now.

       I finished 'Night' today. Mrs. VA said we may have to read it in chunks if it became to emotional for us, but I found myself not being able to put it down. I went online and looked up information about Elie Wiesel. I read his Nobel Prize Acceptance speech. Check it out, it's really good.  http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/ElieWiesel/Nobel_Speech.htm I also found some pictures of him. Mostly when he was older, but I found a picture taken when he was 15 or 14 before he was in the concentration camps. It made me think about the end of the book when he's looking in the mirror. I looked at the picture and I tried to imagine what he looked like at the end of the war. Here's a good quote from Wiesel. I think it does a pretty good job at summerizing why he wrote 'Night' and why understanding what happened during the Holocaust is so important.  "I have tried to keep memory alive, I have tried to fight those who would forget.  Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices...That is why I swore never to be silent whenever wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation. "

       I'm a "Mice and Men" kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' "it's a comfortable read" quote.  It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly.  Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected.  Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military?  Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries.  Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again?  Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq.  Afghanastan was a justified war.  I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade.  What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade.  He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief.  Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected.  I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions.  The more I think about it the sicker I get.  I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit.  Love, Rob  P.S.  I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.

       Maybe contrary to a lot of people, I'm reading "Of Mice and Men". The book so far is faring better than it's intro paragraphs, which when I heard Ms.VA read in class today, I thought it would be so boring. But right now it's becoming more and more like a Western Thriller book, with A LOT of Western vernacular language (as oppose to the Southern vernacular language we encountered in Huck Finn). It's easy to relate to that a lot of language directly imitates the coloquial language as people are speaking (non-sensored words). So overall, a comfortable read.  Other than that, I encountered this article:  urlLink  about some members of the congress are even THINKING of RE-INSTATING the DRAFT.........Utterly sick..........   Yeah anyways, thats a great article, also talks about in December 2003 the United States had 1.44 million troops stationed in 141 countries.  And here is an excerpt from an article from CNN:    CHARLES RANGEL   Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet   Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home.   To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the "citizen soldier" ideal that has served our nation so well.  As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices.   CHARLES MOSKOS   Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee   Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls.   We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories   JAMES INHOFE   Republican Senator from Oklahoma   I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country.   I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.

       So far I am really enjoying the novel 'Night' due to the way in which the novel is written.  The novel consists of choppy, simple and compound sentences, to enforce the view which he is writing from(a child's) while also creating a fearful, anxious tone in the book that comes from these choppy sentences.  In class, Ms. V-A spoke of the novels "poetic tone."  I believe this tone is derived from the sentence structure Wiesel uses in the novel(or atleast the first 15 pages).  Is everyone else seeing this tone? Or something different?  -Pat

       Ya, I also already read 'Of Mice and Men.' I also read the New York Times at 4:30 in the morning everyday. I only read it then because I have to wake up early for zero period. 'Night' is really good so far. Really really sad though. My math teacher said he read the book when he was in high school and that it gave him nightmares. I hope I don't get nightmares. I don't know about the rest of you but AP testing is comming up too quickly.

       Why didn't more people choose 'Of Mice and Men' than 'Night', there appeared to be at least twice as many people reading Night.  For me personally, I've already read Night so Of Mice and Men was the logical choice.  And go read the New York times, it's free online, www.nytimes.com it's good for the brain.

       Hey, I hope you all had a fantastic break... I know I did.  I read "Catcher In The Rye" over the break because there are a lot of references to it in other media sources...Six Degrees of Seperation and Chasing Amy are two movies that the book influences, but I never really felt the significance of it.  It's a book narrated by a student our age about himself.  He's having trouble dealing with his life- he makes references to suicide, he's kind of cynical, thinks everyone's a "phony," as well as intermitently dealing with the death of his brother.  It's written coloquially (like Huck Finn only NINETEEN 50's), and it's kind of funny at times because Holden (the narrator) is such an oddball character, but it's nothing that's really going to change my life.  If you're disconnected with your surroundings and like a straightforward read, you could identify with "Catcher," or if you're Thomas, and are rooting for the nonconformist protagonist, you might really identify.  I guess it just wasn't what I expected, but I AM looking forward to "Of Mice and Men."  Love, Rob

       I visited some schools on the East Coast, and they had similar requirements. For Cornell and NYU, they usually take 4's and always take 5's. It appears some places accept 3's on a few tests, but that usually just allows you to transfer out of the class, it doesn't get you any credits. To actually get college credits takes a 4, or a 5, they seem to be more strict on the science and English tests most places I looked.

       Hey that's a very good question and interesting topic. Yeah some school may offer a credit system in which a 3 may get you into a basic class, and 4 or 5 a more advanced class. But in order to eliminate 5 or more credits, most schools has to see that you have at least a 4 or 5 on most AP exams.  UW is a very typical example of this AP credit system. Here is a link to see how much credits UW offer base on your AP scores:  urlLink UW AP Class Credits

       I know this may be very off topic but I just returned from Gonzaga and found out that Gonzaga and many other schools demand a 4 on the AP Test to count for college credit.  While many of us last year when taking the World History exam believed that to "pass" we needed to get a 3.......well I guess we passed but it doesn't count for anything at alot of the schools that we may be trying to get into when applying next year.  I have also heard a rumor that the University of Washington doesn't accept 3's......this is only a rumor but I would like to hear from anyone else who visited schools to see what other schools demand on the AP Test to count for college credit.                            -Pat

       I started reading "Fountainhead" a while ago, but I wasn't able to finish it. Too much stuff going on. If anyone is looking for a good book to read I recommend anything by Ayn Rand. She's an amazing author.  Over spring break I plan to read "A Passage to India." I don't know much about it. My mom said it was good book. I should start reading it but I'm too absorbed in another book called "Battle Royale." It's by a Japanese author, and the book reminds me a lot of "Lord of the Flies."  The government sends a bunch of kids out on an island and they have to kill each other and whoever is left alive at the end wins. It has a lot to do with government control over the people and what fear can cause you to do. It also relates to the saying of it's a dog eat dog world. It's really bloody, but interesting.  Recently in AP US History we just finished up with WWII. We watched some video clips of the Holocaust with was really shocking for me. Anyway, I remembered something Mrs. VA said about her German friend and how he is still paying for WWII through high taxes, and how he was really upset because he had nothing to do with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. An interesting book which relates to this is "The Reader" by German author Bernhard Schlink. It's a deep book containing a lot of philosophy. It centers around a young man who wasn't involved in WWII but still has to deal with the horrors of postwar Germany.

       Well yeah, "Fountainhead" has a very straight-forward message for individuality, which I absolutely adore, but some people can probably find it a bit too zealous. Are you going to write the scholarship paper for the book Thomas? I think it's due on April 15th. I think you should also add a link to fastweb.com, maybe some people will find some good scholarship opportunities to write for.  Do you have that list of 100 recommended books from collegeboard.com? I have "Candide" next on my list; let me know how good the book is.

       Very inspirational post there Natalya. I agree that we need to have lots more multiple choice practices. And more examples and practices of creating the three levels of questions would be very helpful. Hmm I never thought "Fountain Head" was that good. I'm personally reading this philosophical book by Voltaire called "Candide". What are you all guys reading for spring break?

       Well I joined you guys here too. I was looking at the AP English Barron's book and it seems that in order to do well on the test we need a lot of just practice of taking the answers and knowing what kind of questions are on the test and how to interpret, it's kind of like SATs or ACTs, you do better on english part with more practice. I hope after spring break we will have a lot of practice on the AP mult choice and some timed writing.     The Challenge is to read some good books, I personally recommend "The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand about individuality, the best book I have read and very inspirational. Also if you want some more background on the Holocaust you might want to read "The Pianist" or rent the movie, which I found to be very powerful, yet disturbing. I find reading literature such as "Night" important to remind myself every so often how superficial our problems are when compared to what people had to undergo during Holocaust, WWI, WWII, and even now around the world. Though I find it ironic to see American propaganda against German Nazis and the genocide directed toward Jews, when arguably Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be viewed as genocide directed toward "Japs." Also the fact that U.S. was supporting Iraq against Iran at the time when Sadaam was gassing Curds is especially interesting since the Kurds genocide is one of the reasons we had the war with Iraq. History is very controversial, especially when put in the context of literature. So yeah, liberty and justice for all (with exceptions to those that are different from "all").

       Thomas, I feel like this has become a dialogue between you and I, not that I'm complaining.  It's unfortunate we haven't had as much forced social contact since 8'th Grade Spanish, we sure had good times.  Anyway, I wasn't in class for English today, would anyone like to let me know what the "Spring Break Challenge" is?  It was mentioned on the syllabus, but haven't heard about it since.  Have great breaks everybody!  Love, Rob

       Wow in suggesting me to perform any kind of fashion or dancing show is like thinking the unthinkable. If that made any sense. But anyways, you certainly have a very interesting humor there Rob....And I'll certainly commend you for spicing this blog up with some humor :) As to breakdancing, do you know who's going to be really good at that......Tyson Cecka. So if you ever have any trouble looking for a good break dancer, Tyson Cekca can do it all for you.   And for everybody here, I demand all of you to have an awesome Spring Break!

       Haha, sorry about that Tom, hopefully this one only shows up once.  We got a new desk for the computer, so maybe some good karma comes with the hardwood.  I appreciate your optomism about the assembly, I'm not on the committee so I can just sit back with my fingers crossed and enjoy.  Did anyone approach you about being a model???  If not, we'll have you up there next year in the trashiest outfit Anchor Blue has to offer.  I can see it now...you'll be strutting your stuff down the runway, stopping, turning, throwing your jacket over your shoulder and giving a sexy, heart stopping look Derek Zoolander himself would be proud of.  You're a natural-born star, Tom.  Maybe you can guest-star as a breakdancer for the Rick White experience.  Love,  Rob

       Hello all! We've got quite the rousing discussion going on here, and I figured that I should contribute.  (Sorry this got half published before, I don't know what happened)  I wanted to respond to Ryan E and point out that there have been reports of at least 8,000 and up to 10,000 Iraqi civilians killed in our invasion of their country. I no longer pledge allegiance to our flag. Of course there are many reasons why I no longer pledge allegiance (the false election in 2000; Martha Stewart going to prison while Ken Lay, and countless others, get off; the "defense of marriage act*" +constitutional amendment, the "no child left behind act," and the "patriot act") but the war is a major one right now.   I also agree with Rob though. I suppose it's alright if they keep "under god" in our little third period prayer. It really doesn't bother me; when I still said the pledge, I simply left that part out. And yet, the wanted gap between church and state that would justify keeping "under god" (with Rob's argument) isn't always evident. When the president says, "Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots..." (2/24/04) I lose confidence in the separation between his religious convictions and his political policies.   Here's a site that put the war into perspective: http://www.infoshout.com/the_toll.htm ...Liberty and justice for all, eh?  *AHH! How can they use words like "defense" and "protection" when all you need is $54 to get a license? No proof of love, no plan of action for good intentions, just some cash and a couple signatures. http://www.thestranger.com/2004-03-11/city4.html     ~Beck Nelson~

You can re-enforce your point of view to other people just in case they missed your point on the first post....they have the second and the third post to remind themselves of your arguments. :) Oh yeah and about the assembly, I'm so sad that I can't be there tomorrow, because of the NorthWest Science Expo, I'm sure it will be awesome.

       First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no problem with mandatory repetition of the Pledge of Allegiance because it stands for becoming INDIVISIBLE in an effort against conformity...promotes LIBERTY- the liberty to think, act, and live without government intervention...as well as JUSTICE FOR ALL- the permission for everyone to live as they please. It may be ironic that there is a uniform method of promoting the liberties that lead to diversity, but if everyone is made different through the same process, are they not still different? I recognize the recitation of the Pledge alludes to military service as flags are used to determine a soldier's allegiance in war, but I also believe that the Pledge is more effective with a visual aid. The debate today is whether or not "under GOD" should or even COULD be allowed to stay in the Pledge. I outlined the current particulars of today's case in a previous post, if you haven't read them. To me, this is a case defining the separation of church and state. Although this country was outlined around that seperation, there is nothing that states that government can't recognize the ideology of monotheism, or other belief structure, as long as it doesn't allow the government of religion to directly affect it. One could argue that excluding the possibility of a deity's existence would be not seperating the state from atheist ideology. Tom C addressed free speach...that each American has the right to say what they want and worship as they please. With compliments to that right, many Americans feel the direct connection between Providence and the success of this country, and that excluding their right to express His influence in relation to the country would antithesize their beliefs. The same issue is currently being presented in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as an Atheist man argues that with each (socially) mandatory oration of the Pledge, his daughter is taught that her father's beliefs are the wrong ones. As for me, I believe that eliminating it from the Pledge restricts the large portion of Americans who recognize the Glory of God as parallel with the liberties of this country. For those who are polytheistic, "under god" can be translated as recognizing a "higher power" than is visible in daily life. Lastly, for those that don't recognize any supernatural force or deity, "under God" may be substituted with a respectful pause while those who do choose to recognize God do so. My views have been presented, but I'm all about becoming as educated as I can on the attitudes toward the aspects of life that effect the way we live every day... so school me! If "Night" is a good read, then I'm all for it...especially if it's short! Also, are Rip Van Winkle, The Grapes of Wrath, or The Catcher in the Rye worth reading over break? Because they all spark my interest. Have a great break, and the fabulous assembly ASB will be presenting Friday morning. Love,  Rob

       This is a repost, I accidentally posted over an earlier post of mine, so if it appears twice, you now know why.  I'm about as tech-smart as the chair I'm sitting on.

       Thomas thank you for setting this up.  It took a while but I finally got your email.  Today is Memorial Day and I was just thinking how much I appreciate all the freedoms and protection we have as Americans.  Both of my grandpas went to war.  On my mom's side my grandpa served for four or more years and on my dad's side he served for about four years as well.  It's crazy to think that they went through so much for us today.  It's also weird knowing that someday some of us might take part in a war.  I just wanted to get my first post out and see what other people thought about on Memorial Day.  GOD BLESS!

       Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP English website for the better. There is a "contributing members" section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our AP English friend's blogging profiles. And I've added two things:   1: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 2: Comment option for every post. Hey, if you feel somebody's got a very interesting, or hilarious, or horrible post, feel free to write some comments about that peculiar post.   THANKS ALL MY FRIENDS!  Thomas

       As the year winds down, I want to give some love to the class, especially everyone that posts.  We've had some good times, and I think it would be both mentally beneficial as well as fun to continue blog participation through the summer.  Pat, your essay was inspiring.  I'll be interested to see how the follow-through manifests itself this summer.  Look forward to raisin some philanthropic funds at the fireworks tent across from Blackjack.  To all you potential fireworks buyers this July, Support The Fort!  Blackjack has some good advertising and stuff, but it's run by some weird ass people, I know from experience.  Natalya, I hope your experience doesn't support the thesis you've generated from TEWWG.  I won't deny that some fellas have very rigid beliefs as to how a woman deserves to be treated, but don't let that discourage any of you fine young women.  There are plenty of GOOD guys to go around.  A little format note; I've always wondered how publishing companies created the extended dash, but I've figured it out!  (I have a bloody iMac, so I'm not sure about this on Windows, but...)  Holding the option key and shift key, pressing the button in between the 0 and = key produces the punctuation I've long looked for: — (compared to -).  This makes me so happy!  My essay I wrote easily in one sitting.  It was nice to forego a certain amount of literary analysis and focus on personal response because I felt like I was able to get something off my chest.  I'll post it if desired, but it's more or less a more personal extension of the post with the long quote.  Lastly (this is a very quick-moving post), the Harry Potter story line is nothing new.  The classic series'; Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars have taken the theme of the conflict between Good and Evil and given it a different setting.  The story lines each include some standard elements of personal struggle and sacrifice, making the story quite predictable, yet gripping nonetheless.  For example, Luke Skywalker must resist the Dark Side of the Force, Frodo frequently expresses the grip he knows the ring has on him, and even Harry Potter fought with himself in his choice of House, ultimately siding against Slytherin's beckoning promise of power.  I could make a pretty good guess to the end of the series because they all end very similarly, but I will NOT stop reading them till Voldemort is contained and Harry graduates (or maybe he dies in sacrifice, that OCCASIONALLY happens, but I doubt it in this instance).  The key to writing a successful series is the ability to weave reader interaction into a story as Rachel addressed, and equally important, putting a unique spin on the fantastic setting.  To reiterate, I love you all  Love, Rob

       I found Catcher in the Rye to be a bit scary too once I realized that Holden was really mentally unstable. My paper was a parody on Holden and I just hope Mrs. VA won't be too disturbed by the "creativity" of my imagination in this paper. It was actually really fun to explore the thoughts of a potential character like that, I could draw a lot for my writing from my guy-friends and their thoughts that they express verbally, I think I could write a whole book just in that kind of a colloquial style, exploring the different ideas people have in their mind during the day.   I ran our of my reading mood, so Their Eyes were Watching God is only half finished for now, but so far my reaction to it is: men are sexist and generally evil, with rare exceptions. That is of course an exaggeration but the feeling I get from the book so far is that men find a girl, get what they want from her, that is love and attachment and then either get bored and move on to another "victim" or exploit the already used and hypnotised girl to fullest potential. I just couldn't believe it how Janie's first husband first begged her to marry him and then went to by her a mule so that she could plow his fields. The same with her second husband Jody who first says: "you behind a plow! You ain't got no mo' business wid uh plow than uh hog is got wid uh holiday! ... A pretty dall-baby lak you is made to sit on de front porch and rock and fan yo'self and eat p'taters dat other folks plant just special for you." It's ridiculous how he very soon placed her behind the counter of his shop and scoundreled her for miscounting. I just wouldn't believe the swift change from adornment to "... you [Janie] need tellin'. Somebody got to think for women and chillun and chickens and cows. I god, they sho don't think none theirselves." I just love the comparison between women and chickens, no wonder the word "chicks" addressed toward girls is still in the lexicon. I want to finish the book though, maybe Tea Cake will bring some optimistic news about the race of men and will lower down my cynicism.   I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas about the significance of Janie's beautiful hair and the crazy mule running around.  Call me a nerd but I love Harry Potter books, they are just so beyond imagination it's fascinating. They inspire me to write something like that too, only it's hard to come up with new ideas for a story; I think I am going to go think about some potentially successful ideas for a plot, maybe that will get me into Harvard, or at least I could make millions of dollars selling the books and then just bribe the admisions officers;) I think the movies are not that great though. Lord of the Rings series were better and closer to the actual book. These kinds of books are just fun to read in order to get away from the ordinary world, afterall it gets really boring here sometimes and they don't take that long to read becuase they have such straigh-forward ideological content: the good always wins, yet I have to agree with Pat that they are a bit stricky in the story line. I am still struggling with Fountainhead though, that book is insane, the more I read of it the harder it becomes and the more I want to read it.

       I don't know about the rest of you, but I would like to read some of the other papers that students have written to see different perspectives on the topics.  I will share mine, it was based on The Great Gatsby, and I chose the second prompt that concerned how the book has influenced our beliefs....read mine but I would   really   like to read others papers so please share.  A Positive Influence on My Beliefs  	I have been raised to believe in the importance of Christian values that have shaped me into the moral person I am today.  After reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald and encountering the degradation of values concerning upper-class society in the 1920’s, I have been influenced to strengthen my moral values. 	Fitzgerald’s novel is portrayed through a description of two wealthy Long Island communities where the center of attention is the Gatsby mansion where “The Great Gatsby” holds his famous parties where Fitzgerald focuses his novel on the characters of Tom and Daisy Buchanan and Nick Carraway(the narrator).  Fitzgerald uses the beliefs of these characters to mock and show the beliefs of 1920’s upper-class society. 	Jay Gatsby is an “Oxford man” who, after fighting in World War I becomes fabulously wealthy through criminal business to pursue his love-Daisy Buchanan.  Gatsby is portrayed as a mysterious figure who everyone admires for his extravagant amount of wealth.  Gatsby’s attitude toward money is shown in a quote that is taken from a flashback on Gatsby’s life stating  “To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.”  The authors reasoning for showing the materialistic attitude is for the reader to make the connection of how money can corrupt one’s thinking.  Gatsby, like many other characters in the novel, is so engrossed in wealth that it seems to be the sole thing that gives him satisfaction in his life.  	Gatsby’s obsession with wealth is nothing compared to the attitude of Daisy Buchanan, a longtime lover of Gatsby.  Daisy Buchanan is not interested in love, but completely in material possessions.  Daisy’s attitude is best described in a quote when Daisy is admiring en extensive collection of Gatsby’s shirts.  She states,  “They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in thick folds.  ‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such-such beautiful shirts before.”  Fitzgerald is able to portray a multitude of character insights in this small quote.  First and foremost Fitzgerald is depicting Daisy as a fool for being so engrossed in a collection of shirts.  Also, the author gives insight as to what Daisy’s true love is-wealth.  Daisy married her husband Tom because he had money, not because she loved him as a person.  Tom knows what Daisy’s true love is, and in response began an affair with a woman in the city.  Fitzgerald uses Daisy’s attitude and the relationship between Tom and Daisy to show the corrupt beliefs of upper-class marriages during this time period.  Fitzgerald is saying that upper-class marriages weren’t based upon love-but two selfish people getting what they, without regard to morals. 	While most the characters are immersed in materialism, Nick Carraway has contrasting beliefs.  Nicks beliefs are based upon morals, not money.  In the end of the novel, Nick makes the decision to move away from the upper-class society of the East, and move back to the Midwest where morality is more important than money.  Nick describes his decision when saying “...the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.  So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry on the line I decided to come back home.”  Nick makes a decision to get away from what he knows will influence him and eventually corrupt his beliefs. 	Through analyzing the beliefs of these characters, my own personal beliefs have been influenced greatly.  Fitzgerald’s portrayal of a corrupt upper-class society made me realize that I am so very fortunate and that I take for granted the wealth that I am immersed in.  I am far from a Daisy Buchanan, but am still caught up in material possessions from time to time.  After reading this book, I am sickened that the upper-class in this book wasted their lives living a life where they were unable to love one another normally because they were so greatly influenced by material possessions.  What is the point in having an extravagant shirt collection?  Where is the need to host a party every weekend that leads to a myriad of people being plastered with alcohol.  It is a complete waste that I don’t ever want to be a part of.   I have developed such strong beliefs from reading this book that instead of spending my money on upgrading my car this summer, it will go towards something useful.  I am so very glad I read this book, for it opened my eyes to what is really important in life and that is not possessions, it is giving back when I have the ability to share my wealth. 	 SO THERES MY PAPER.......WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK?

       First of all, I have to say that Pat you couldn't explain Harry Potter any better.  Something about the plot captivates the reader, but I have never stopped to think about what it could be... How could I when I wasn't even able to stop to put them down?  Being a person that has read all of the Harry Potter books countless numbers of times, everytime I read them I pick up on another clue that has a link to a later point in the plot.  You don't even understand how excited I was to realize that Moony, was because he was a wearwolf, Wormtail was because he was a rat and had a tail like a worm, Padfoot the dog, and Prongs was the stag.  I seriously set down my book and was amazed... Maybe it was a little more obvious for others, but when different things in the book all of a sudden click and come together and you get the feeling that a light bulb just came on, its irreplaceable.  That's why these books are good for all ages, younger kids wouldn't necessairly make all of the connections but the mere plot and setting of a magical place that all of us wish we could be a part of would be enough to draw them in.  While adults and teenagers are able to make all of the small connections that makes for a thrilling read. As you can tell, I'm absolutly in love with Harry Potter, and June 4th is marked on my calender! I can't even wait...  Now for a more serious side, Ryan I can see exactly what you mean about Their Eyes Were Watching God.  It definitly focuses on how money and status are not everything in a relationship and you can't "buy" love.  Although it's always said, but it's true, love only comes on its own.  Janie could have had anything she wanted when she was with Jody, but the love was not there.  However when she was with Tea Cake and didn't have a big house and everything else she was never happier. It just goes to show that love is the most important part of relationships and nothing can replace it.   - Rachel Penny

       	The most respected black writer of the Harlem Renaissance, Richard Wright, said of Zora Neale Hurston’s novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, “[it] carries no theme, no message, no thought,” and after reading the novel for myself I came to the conclusion that Mr. Wright’s perspective and preformed filters limited his ability to perceive the delicate and emotional subtleties of the story.  Their Eyes Were Watching God records one woman’s pursuit of love, a venture which is beautifully complex and unexpectedly educational.  Unlike a majority of black writers in the 1930s who created serious, in-your-face literature, Hurston chose to write a novel that extended beyond the black protest tradition and connected with readers on a level unaffected by race or gender.  Hurston does not blatantly broadcast an image of black struggle as her early critics would have preferred; instead, she unfurls a story, revealing intricacies of love and emotion that many men are never privy to.  Although writers such as Richard Wright believe love to be trivial in comparison to the awareness of black oppression, Hurston’s novel should be commended for discussing unique and unexplored topics.  Their Eyes challenges the notion that riches and status alone can attract a woman to a man, and reinforces the message that a man must respect a woman for her mind for a relationship to be truly fulfilling.  The emotional journey of Janie Crawford, the female protagonist, encouraged me to believe that true love is attainable through perseverance, and that the tragedy of loss is outweighed by the memories of time spent with a soul mate.

       Hi everyone! I have finally been given permission to post on our class blog.  I just wanted to make a quick post and say hello.  The Catcher In The Rye was a quick, and enjoyable read.  I thought this book was very depressing, which, I'm sure, is a shared opinion between those of us who have read it.  Holden, the main character, scared me quite a bit.  Throughout his decline, I began to notice quite a lot of similarities between he and I; this is scary because Holden loses control of his life.  I'm curious to find what other people's opinions are of this book, and if they felt any connection with Holden.

       I've mentioned how much I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code on this blog before and Pat's post about Harry Potter is similar to how the Da Vinci Code is affecting adults.  The book isn't too long, and isn't hard to read, but it's not a ground breaking novel either.  The subject matter I think is what has made the book so popular at first glance.  Everyone knows about the Holy Grail legend, Leonardo Da Vinci, and secret societies.  The success of the book builds upon itself, like Harry Potter, word of mouth causes a snowball effect on popularity.  But I digress, I just hope the movie is as good as the book.

       With the approach of the latest Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban, I would like to take some time to reflect upon arguably the personally fulfilling series of books I have read. (Don't laugh, I know all of you read these books.....and love them)  First of all, the genius of J.K. Rowling is her organization.  How many times have you been reading these books and come across a turn in the plot, and then remembered hearing a small clue earlier in the book or in a past book that led directly to a crucial part in the book.  To clarify that last statement I will give some examples.  EX 1: Harry has to live with the Dursleys-find out later this gives him protection when he's away from Hogwarts.  EX 2: Ron's rat Scabbers-find out later it is Wormtail, supporter of Voldemort who framed Sirius and lived with Ron and his family to be able to hear news from the wizarding world concerning Voldemorts whereabouts/possible return.   While the plot is deeply woven for a simple children's novel, this is not the only reason for the success of these books.  What makes these books so wildy popular is the way in which the reader is so captivated by the setting of a wizarding world in which spells and flying is a reality.  What kid could resist a fantasy like this?  I sure couldn't.  I am 17 years old and am still spellbound(pun).  I have talked to adults that are more obsessed than I am.  If anyone caught last weeks TRL on MTV is was all about Harry Potter and kids dressed up in robes and competed to get a role on the next Harry Potter film. One girl participating was able to name the license plate number of the Weasley's car in the second movie.....that is seriously ridiculous.  Speaking of ridiculous, the winner was a kid about our age who literally was jumping up and down, crying with joy after he won the contest.  I'm sorry but after reading Benjamin Franklin's autobiography I was hardly jumping up and down with joy.(I am not bashing Benjamin Franklin-just pointing out how a setting can contribute to the joy of reading a novel)  So now that I have gone off on a tangent, I would like to hear from anyone else that has been so engrossed in the novels as I have.  Call me obsessive, I don't even care.  Read the books-then call me obsessive.  Yes, these novels will probably not help you get into an Ivy League school but don't we deserve a treat after all the reading we have done this year?  Like William Forrester said on Finding Forrester, "I read the Times for a main dish, and the tabloids for a dessert"  Go on, treat yourself.  Or even better, start an argument against me.  I would love to hear it. -Pat

       I'm 100% in favor of isolating and analyzing those philosophical quotes in the hearts of novels.  My favorite (besides "my mother is a fish") in As I Lay Dying comes from the woman who lays dying.  The quote comes at the end of a chapter that deals with the nature of words- how words and names are used to describe emotions and feelings but they're always insufficient if there isn't first hand knowledge of the experience that the word's trying to describe.  As an example...  "I would think Anse (the name of her husband).  Why Anse.  Why are you Anse.  I would think about his name until after a while I could see the word as a shape, a vessel, and I would watch him liquify and flow into it like cold molasses flowing out the darkness into a vessel, until the jar stood full and motionless: a significant shape profoundly without life like an empty door frame; and then I would find that I had forgetten the name of the jar.  I would think: The shape of my body where I used to be a virgin is in the shape of a            and I couldn't think ANSE, couldn't remember ANSE.  It was not that I could think of myself as no longer unvirgin, because I was three now (had three kids now).  And when I would think CASH and DARL (the names of her first two children) that way until their names would die and solidify into a shape and then fade away, I would say, All right.  It doesn't matter what they call them.  "And so when Cora Tull would tell me I waas not a true mother, I would thinnk how words go straight up in a thin line, quick and harmless, and how terribly doing goes along the earth, clinging to it, so that after a while the two lines are too far apart for the same person to straddle from one to the other; and that sin and love and fear are just sound that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words.  Like Cora who could never even cook."  Sorry for the long intro- but keeping that attitude towards words in mind, comprehend the significance of the quote I really wanted to address.  "One day I was talking to Cora.  She prayed for me because she believed I was blind to sin, wanting me to kneel and pray too, (this is the big part) because people to whom sin is just a matter of words, salvation is just a matter of words too."  I read it as questioning a lot of peoples' grasp on religion.  Sinners who believe that sin is just in words miss the meaning of words, miss the meaning of sin.  Addie really does know sin, she has a child from a man outside her marriage and holds resentment towards her whole family as well as God.  I think this is a quote that can have a lot of interpretation, so think about it and post your thoughts.  Love Rob

       Catcher in the Rye is such a comfortable read and a great book that many of us at this age can relate to. Even with Holden's very personal, eclectic ideas, interrupted and day-dreaming like train of thoughts, my brain can somehow feel a connection. And actually this personal and colloquial style is what really makes this book engaging, interesting, and awesome. I feel like I can easily follow Holden's train of thoughts, even when he daydreams from one seemingly unrelated topic to another. That's just how the human brain thinks. Salinger constructed such a real, believable teenager figure.  Finally, as Paul advertised so nicely, besides the great New York Times, there is also the great magazine New Yorker everyone should read. Especially in the May 23rd edition in which there was the famous article "The Gray Zone" written by Seymour Hersh probing the secret interrogation agencies and facillities that were in widespread use. All of these abuses we are witnissing today directly relates to the intentional or unintentional commands from the Pentagon (including Rumsfeld himself). But yeah, read this famous article "The Gray Zone" by Seymour Hersh.

       Holden reminds me a lot of someone who's eyes aren't open to the real world.  He's had his life handed to him by his parents, and no doubt while he loves them a lot of his frustrations are coming from a lack of direction.  He's been directed all his life and he struggles to be who he wants to be.  Because he's never worked for anything he doesn't understand the value of anything and throws away his extremely valuable education and life his well to do parents have given him.  He judges people and fails to make successful relationships because he's placed arbitrary value in some unimportant things.  However I feel Holden has a kind heart, and that counts for a lot.  He's simply, uninformed to say the worst, and is a bit odd.  For me, the character makes sense, and I do find the book extremely memorable, much more so than many other novels I've read.  I find the conciseness of the book commendable, Orwell's philosophy of saying what you need to say without the fluff is philosophy now too.

       I actually really like the prompts that we have for the writing assignment, they give a lot to write about. I am going to write a parody on Catcher in the Rye, the book itself provides a lot of ideas to write about.  I think one of the major problems with olden is in his believe that people do things for the wrong reasons: not because it's what they want to do, but because it's what everyone else wants them to do. He expresses it in this quote about lawyers: "Even if you did go around saving guys' lives and all, how would you know if you did it because you really wanted to save guys' lives, or because you did it because what you really wanted to do was be a terrific lawyer, with everybody slapping you on the back and congratulating you in court when the goddam trial was over...?" And I find that to be true for myself, I sometimes wonder if I want to go to a great school like Harvard just because it's a famous school and it will look good on my resume or because I believe that I will actually learn better and enjoy studying there; I have to admit though that often the answer is: I like the name a lot, sounds big and important:(   I was also looking at this quote by Mr. Antolini in the book : "If you go along with it [academic edu.] considerable distance, it'll give you an idea what size mind you have. What it'll fit and, maybe, what it won't. After a while you'll have an idea what kind of thoughts your particular size mind should be wearing." I just happen to really disagree with this quote, just because I am against any kind of parameters set on a human mind and consciousness, I believe that there is no limit to our ability to learn and understand new ideas, and so there shouldn't ever be such thing as a "size mind" ... do you like it small, large, or supersize?  I like to analyze different "smart" quotes from books, gives you something to ponder about.

       Ryan, I agree that more guys should read Their Eyes Were Watching God. Men and women have different perspectives on life and think completely differently. However I think Their Eyes Were Watching God allows the reader to get inside the mind of a women and how they view relationships. This could be very benefical for guys that read it to understand how women think... It's also a good book besides that and isn't the "girl power" book you would think it would be. I highly recommend it.

       Pat, I agree with you that Gatsby is a success as a story critical of the society during the 20s, but the only analogy I can make to the book is that of a turkey that is served for Thanksgiving dinner, it doesn't have its feathers and it doesn't look as beautiful as it did when it was alive but it's still a bird, so is this book, it has a story but it lacks the "feathers" - it lacks commentary and reflections of the author; it's just a story with a very interesting plot and a straight-forward message of society being corrupted and fake. And it's true that maybe the story doesn't need the extraneous ornaments but it's just much more engaging to see what the author himself has to say about the story, it creates a conversation as you read the book between you and Fitzgerald.  Rob, sorry but I didn't find AILD yet, so I started on Their eyes were watching God, but I will get to it as soon as I find the book. You should start though on Fountainhead, that book is really hard to read, partly because it has so much philosophy and such a complicated plot in it. But you definitely should read it, I really need someone to discuss it with:(  Discussing Catcher in the Rye today helped a lot, there were a lot of things that I haven't even realized as I read the book, such as for example the fact that Holden ends up in a mental hospital or that he is crazy all along in the story. As I read the book I had this feeling that he was a bit strange, but because the book was written as his own personal thoughts I just took it for normal that his mind wondered all over, I sort of think we all have that in our mind where we think of random thinks during the day once in a while. I also heard a lot of criticism of the character, but I still believe that he is a really nice person that has just come to a state of dissatisfaction with the society around him; he does exaggerate a lot and he seems to be critical of everyone and everything he sees, but it sounds like it all comes from bitterness and depression of his character. Maybe he wants to be a catcher in the rye because he knows that there is no one else to catch him if he were to jump off a cliff. It's strange how the more I think about him the more depressed I become myself. Ducks are lucky, they can just fly away whenever it gets too cold ...

       If love is a battlefield as Pat Benatar famously said, then Their Eyes Were Watching God is a top secret report addressed to the Female Commander that was intercepted and expressed mailed to the Male General.  Zora Neale Hurston writes about a woman named Janie searching for her soul mate and finding a few duds along the way.  In the process, Hurston provides insight into the female perspective in a way I've never encountered.  When women speak of love it seems as though they carefully construct a model of an ideal relationship, but the honest solitude of writing allows Hurston to leak key secrets about the art of war/love.  A recurring metaphor in the novel compares perfect love to the blossom of a pear tree, and through the exploits of Janie, the protagonist, the author defines the love blossom as a relationship in which a man treats a woman as his equal and respects her mind, all the while making her glow from every fingertip and toe. Easier said than done? Absolutely, but Their Eyes chronicles the mistakes of foolish men, writing a virtual how-not-to book on love.  I feel I'm a more complete person after reading it because I attained a deeper understanding of female emotion and compassion.  I believe Their Eyes is a book that should be read by all men because it teaches how women feel and why they feel the way they do, key bits that are rarely divulged and usually left to be deciphered through telepathy, a skill that few of us poor saps are granted.  Zora Neale Hurston's novel may be about encountering womanhood, but it’s a worthwhile read for everyone because it demystifies the differences between the sexes and could possibly save or prevent a future dysfunctional marriage.   -By: Ryan Elliott   PS - I had no idea anyone could think as beautifully as Hurston does in this book

       I'm coming to the end tonight Beck, but there is certainly no doubt in my mind that each one of those Bundren's is crazier than the next.  I certainly enjoyed kickin it w/ you and the crew at Mr. Skyview, and I'd like to commend Divcom for raising 6 g's for Make a Wish Foundation.  Natalya; Fountainhead is Ayn Rand, is it not?  I'll read it if you read AILD and we'll have a two book discussion going on.  Pat, I'm in agreement w/ you about Gatsby.  One of my favorites of the year... I really enjoyed a fictional approach to social commentary.  Not really satire, but 100% effective- a challenge to the alcohol consuming socialites who had lost the traditional values of the turn of the century.  It's a direct insult to those who live that life.  And the whole time there is the allusion to "big brother" with the doctor's eyes.  My take is that although the socialites attempted to cover their moral discrepencies in speakeasies and  private parties, it was clear to everyone what was really going on.  Just a thought, no evidence to back it up, but I think it sounds good.  One month of school left!!!  Love Rob

       Who says The Great Gatsby is a boring book?  I have heard that from countless people who have seen me reading the book and its not true.  The novel, like other successful American Lit. novels, criticizes society through the experiences of a narrator that is a central character in the novel.  The Great Gatsby criticizes the "roaring twenties" by depicting the upper class' lifestyle that consists of breaking prohibition laws, having affairs, and murder.  Throughout the book I felt a sense of this lifestyle that I can only describe as "hollow."  That may not make sense, but it seemed to me as if the novel showed the upper class as not having a role in society, just partying and living a life that didn't have a significant meaning.    Going back to my thought on how this novel is successful due to its criticism of society, I can draw many similairities between this novel and Huckelberry Finn.  Both novels consisted of a central character that had the role of the narrator, both mocked society of the time period, and both novels a relationship between the narrator and another central character that grew as the novel progressed-both resulting in the parting of these two characters at the climax of the novel.    Maybe there are some other thoughts on this novel.....anyone?  -Pat

       Okay, I just finished "the catcher in the rye" and I don't quite know what to make of it. This blog entry will double as somewhat of a discovery process (hopefully) for me and I will hopefully be able to come to some sort of conclusion about some aspect of the book. If I begin to ramble I apologize.  First I'd like to talk about the significance of the title. When his sister asked him what he liked I was anxious to hear his answer. Immediately he ponders some off-the-topic idea and comes back to the topic after his sister says, "You can't even think of one thing." He responds with, "Yes, I can. Yes, I can." He than talks about his brother and the enjoyment he gets out of talking to his sister. These things he comes up with are so simple. Then he tells about how he simply wants to be a catcher in the rye. I like the connection Natalya made with the James Castle and the "catcher" Holden. This seems like one of many intricate connections that Salinger makes. Finally I think the title signifies he wants a simple life with a simple purpose. Now I finally see the connection with his displeasure with "phonies." Phonies to Holden suggest some sort of unneeded attention aimed at bettering the perception other people have on them. This adds to the idea that he wants a simple life that is not fake and that has a purpose. Obviously one can see that being "phony" has no "real" purpose. This contributes to his dislike of the idea.  One thing I noticed was the abrupt conclusions Holden comes to when looking at different situations in his life. It's hard to find examples, a few off the top of my head are: the inferiority complex and the conceited men, the kids always having to meet their friends and the yearbook handsomeness. He even ends his story with a simple conclusion of his.  Hmm... That was somewhat helpful for me. I hope I didn't sound like a rambling idiot. Oh yeah, does anyone see the significance with the ducks? ~Frank

       I'm reading "AILD" as well, Rob, and i quite agree; it is fascinating. Have you got the end yet? It's CRAZY. Sort of.... unexpected anyway. Mrs VA introduced the book by telling us that the Bundren family was simply unintelligent ("really stupid," i think she said) but i've come to a different understanding of them. (No offense to Mrs VA - I was just using you as a handy introduction-type idea). Anse is the only person in the book who strikes me as truley stupid, but i think his stupidity comes from his country stubborness and pride. The rest of them are pretty much just pure crazy as opposed to dumb. Cash pulls through in the end as the sanest of the bunch - too bad his leg is rotted off. I think that Darl's developement is very interesting; his narrations retain some of his characteristic vocabulary, but he is badly cracked by the end. And i see what you're saying (Rob) about Vardaman's run on excitement, but i think it runs right on through to insanity. (conclusion)  -Beck-

       Hey Rob, I am going to start As I lay Dying tomorrow, I'm not sure if we will have any more time for discussions, but I would certainly love to talk about the book. Discussions are great, as long as people are interested in talking about a book.  I personally recommend everyone to read "Fountainhead." Every time I come back to reading this book it elevates me to a totally different level of understanding of life, it's so crazy, it's like a philosophy book but the only philosophy is in the lives of the people that are in the book, I mean it's just great! You have to read it, there are no words of explanation for this masterpiece.  People "die with every day that passes. When you meet them, they're not what you met last. In any given hour, they kill some part of themselves. They change, they deny, they contradict - and the call it growth. At the end there's nothing left, nothing unreversed or unbetrayed; as if there had never been an entity, only a succession of adjectives fading in and out on an unformed mass."

       I'm glad everyone has found a book that's suited them for this most recent project.  Having read both Gatsby and Catcher, I find it kind of fun to play along as you get to know Holden and slowly resent 20's life.  Right now I'm reading As I Lay Dying, and it's like nothing I've ever read before.  The style is insanely unique (albeit a little difficult to get used to) as Faulkner switches narrators from one miserable member of the Bundren family to another with each passing chapter.  Faulkner gives real personality to the characters not by description, per se, but by narrating  as they think.  For instance, Vardaman is the youngest of the characters,  and his narration is distinct for his simple vocab and run on sentences that accurately depict the excitement of a child.  Darl on the other hand is viewed as a deep thinker so his vocab is more expansive and Faulkner really tries to play around with language and philosophy under the pretense of death.  While I rejoice that my classmates enjoy their respective novels, I'm slightly disappointed I have but one compatriot that can share the sentiments of my novel.  If you have some free time this summer, AILD will keep your mind engaged.  Keep up the great work as the instinctual countdown in your brains approaches june 23!  Love Rob

       Hey Nova, thanx for joining us, it's been getting rather quiet here lately.... The Great Gatsby is not that great after all, I guess it's just not my kind of "great literature." First I though I was missing something in the book, but now I think that it's the but the book that's missing something... The author states his doctrine on the first page: "whenever you feel like criticizing anyone... just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had," which dictates the rest of the book making it "lack" any kind of criticism expressed by the narrator or any "reflections" upon the issues raised by the actions of characters in the book. He simply leaves it all for the reader to interpret and draw her/his own conclusions. I understand that's great in the fact that it makes you think for yourself about what you read instead of just reading off the dogmas that the author provides you with layed out on a silver plate. But my problem is that I need someone to discuss the book with, even if it be the author himself through the context of the "sophisticated sentences" he writes down in his book, or his thoughts.   That's why I think I liked Catcher in the Rye so much more, the author just told you everything he thought, even though all the digressions could sometimes get distracting. It's strange how the book just gives you three days of this boy's life but you know everything about his character you could ever find out. I first thought he was rather sardonic and just negative in general toward life and people, all of his comments and criticism, but toward the end of the book I couldn't help but love this boy. The way he just tells his little sister how he wants to be a catcher in the rye.. "standing on the edge of some crazy cliff... I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff...I have to come out from somewhere and catch them..." and just makes you feel like you know that he would have caught that boy that jumped out of the window and that he would have kept that young girl from selling her body and that he would have donated all of his money to those two nuns if he could... just the simple things he says and does make him so unrealistically true and "good"... I am trying though to figure out what is the significance of the carousel at the end of the book... why does it make him so happy?

       Hello all.  It's Nova.  How is everyone's book going for them?  The Great Gatsby is pretty good.  I thought it would be boring but I actually got into the story, although some parts of it were confusing.  The people in our discussion group were having a hard time trying to figure out Dr. T.J. Eckleberg.  Does he represent God?  Nick?  Or just a random billboard, watching everything?  Anyone have any ideas?  Also, we had a group consensus that we dislike Tom and Mrs. Wilson (well, mostly a consensus).  I have to go, but I'll come back later! Bye

       Like Corey, I am also reading Their Eyes Were Watching God.  I really enjoy reading it. It's more relaxing of a read opposed to having to analyze a piece for rhetorical strategies.  It's nice to have no pressure after the AP tests and be rewarded for spending the first three fourths of the year challenging ourselves and preparing for the "big test."

       The blog's been rather quiet lately.  I'm finding the catcher in the rye an easy and memorable read.  I personally find the characters very realistic, especially Holden, I enjoy how the entire book is simply living the life of somebody who's our age, but engrossing simply because Salinger paints such an accurate portrait.  But I'm not hearing unanimous agreement from others, since people in my small group are finding different views of the book.  But what's really on my mind isn't the catcher in the rye, for me it's the aftermath of the ISEF fair.  Aside from meeting kids who I'm sure will be extremely successful before they're 30, I saw a group of 4 of them on my favorite business commentator's show, Lou Dobbs, talking about their projects tonight.  I wish I could accomplish as much as they have already.  I'm having the hardest time finding a good idea which real practical applications.  Getting started is always hardest but I digress.  I just feel like there is so much any of us could be accomplishing and I hate feeling like a sponge.  But there's always next year!  Or this summer I should say!  -Read a real newspaper, go to www.nytimes.com

       Hey everyone whats up?  I like how we are ending the year with fun reading and basic skills about research and other things, after taking the AP test it should be this way.  I am reading Their Eyes were Watching God, it is a really good book and I highly reccomend it, because it's a story that tells of a woman who had tough relationships, and you may know people like this girl, and eventually meets this awesome guy named Tea Cake, I mean with a name like that why wouldn't you want to read the book.  -Corey Furin-

       I personally think everyone should congratulate Rob for his 2nd place at MUN this Saturday! He really did a  great job and it is thanx to him that our team got all the first places:) And I invite everyone to join our club, you never know what hidden talents you have.   Going on to Gatsby, I see the irony of Gatsby's "friends" not even coming to his funeral and the fact that his beloved Daisy runs off and he has to pay for her mistake with his own life. The scenes of the party in his house are truly what the 20s were like for the elite and give me just a general visual of pigs partying in dirt, a feeling of disgust. Also disturbing is the fact that Tom's mistress Myrtle is like that puppy he bought for her on the street, and that he can throw her away as easily as that puppy. I loved the description of women of that time as elegant and mysterious which then created a special contrast with their greed for money and superficial expression of love. I mean I see a lot of themes going on in the book and they are quite obviously related to materialism, but it feels like there is something missing in it, like it's too easy or maybe I just expected too much from the book after hearing all these great things about it. I liked the book, but I don't feel like it changed my life or like it is a masterpiece of literature.

       Hey Rob, in response to your welcome to me as to returning to the "real world", I have a few words to say. Forgive me if I sound like a nerdy bigot here.  First of all, I have to say that yes, certainly, I've got your note you so graciously left on my exhibit booth. I have to thank with my deepest appreciation to all and everyone who came to visit Intel ISEF on Thursday or Friday.   With all the scientific jargons EVERYWHERE in the beloved ISEF exhibits hall that would probably intimidate a good deal of people just with their first step into the ISEF exhibit hall, yes I do agree the environment I was immersed in for the past whole week is out of touch with the "rest of the society". But on a different note, we had the wonderful opportunity to meet people from ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.....We were chatting about not just what scientific discoveries, methods, projects we worked on over the past years, but we ISEF finalists also discussed politics (yeah discussing politics with people from other countries is kinda interesting), our hometowns, schools, and just our personal nerdy lives in general. We also have had LOTS AND LTOS OF SOCIAL LIFE....more social life in the past week than I've ever had in my life. Just being in the convention center makes you feel more mature, and everything was in adult settings and business attires. All the strict rules, politeness, civilness in conjunction with meeting professors, Nobel Laureates, leading scientists and teachers of all fields that represent modern society. True, all of these cameras, press, Nobel laureates are probably very special, but these famous people (both adults and ISEF students) I met do constitute part of our world and the contributions of the scientists is what move the society forward, not the verbatim politicians. Besides, I'd rather be in a environment of overly academicness, formalness, and overly famous people to see what really the world of brainpower is like than be in an environment that encourages some kind of phobia to academia and modern sciences (We had some fun times chuckling and making fun of Bush on the bureaucracy and the political barriers to modern science advances, such as the stem cell research, and it was started by Nobel Laureates) YEAH SO ISEF ALL THE WAY....5000 times more REAL WORLD! lol.   And now I'm looking forward to catch up all the work I've missed the past week lol. Catcher in the Rye seems to be a very comfortable reading right now. I've looking forward to discussing the book with other interested readers.

       Wow, it's been a few days since I last checked the blog and I feel so out of touch... so I have some preambulatory clauses to address before I get to the real, English-related topic of the post.  First and foremost, I'd like to  CONGRATULATE the members of Skyview MUN for their various awards and other successes at the district tournament this weekend, RECOGNIZING the efforts of the Russian Federation in successfully warding off the political opposers of the Rodina FURTHER RECOGNIZING that said efforts resulted in both best team in General Assembly as well as best team overall and, LOOKS FORWARD TO seeing the big ass trophy that results  I really had a good time and look forward to participating in the future.  Secondly, Thomas, welcome back to the real world.  I hope you got my note when I went to visit you and you weren't there, but if you didn't, I came to support the scientific mind Natalya has recognized as a Hottie.  Now to the Great Gatsby... I feel like a major nerd here, but I really enjoyed the book and feel I was able to track the author and accompanying symbolism.  (This is where I feel like a nerd)  I would therefore like to reference the independent reading report I did on it earlier on in the year; 	  The Great Gatsby is considered the great American novel because below the cloak of an extravagant love story is the erosion of American society in the Roaring 20’s, or “Jazz Age,” as Fitzgerald dubbed it.  Gatsby himself is the symbol of the American dream as Fitzgerald saw it:  he’s rich and therefore a socialite, he throws lavish parties where hundreds of “friends” come to his mansion to glorify the vices of society, namely alcohol and sex, and he pursues unrealistic fantasies on a whim, attempting to bend reality to fit his sensibilities.  Gatsby’s love interest, Daisy, is respectable and accountable, besides being desirable.  When Gatsby tries to woo Daisy, and runs into obstacles, it is apparent in Gatsby’s demeanor that the American lifestyle is unraveling, as demonstrated in his cessation of party hosting.  In the end, when Gatsby’s protection of Daisy results in his death, it is apparent at his funeral when none of his “friends” come to mourn how the American lifestyle is truly viewed; as base, vile, and taboo.  Long story short, Gatsby was symbolic of the twenties life-style, (as AP US History should have taught you) a life-style that Fitzgerald was against.  Viewing Gatsby as an embodiment of the Roaring 20's may alter your position toward him and his actions as you read.  Some other interesting symbolism was the role of the Green Light that was Gatsby's hope in reuniting with Daisy, and the role of the Dr.'s Eyes.  I really really enjoyed Gatsby, so if anyone who is reading it wishes to discuss it extracurricularly, I'd love to participate.  I'd also like to note that Faulkner's As I Lay Dying is an entirely different style than I believe I've encountered before, and the humor and complexity of the book make it a lot of fun as well.  I love that post AP test, there is still so much interest in American Lit.  Love Rob

       HEY MS.VA AND ALL MY AP ENGLISH FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!  I just would like to say that Thomas Chen had had the wonderful opportunity to experience through one of the best week in his life. Intel International Science and Engineering Fair is truly world class and the experience once in a life opportunity.  The awards and free stuff we got were only a temporary excitement, but the most valuable experience was making great friends from all 50 states and 40 countries around the world!!!!!! It's 100% probable that one or two friends you make in ISEF will be in the future leaders of the world, billionaires, or Nobel Laureates. The country and state pin exchanges, the plethora of ISEF ceremonies, all the social events were truly amazing. Furthermore, we the ISEF competitors got to be in a press like room with the Nobel Laureates as a panel. We were like the press asking the prestigious Nobel Laureates questions and they would answer us right there. It was truly astounding.   Yeah I guess the most important idea I've learned and experienced through this ISEF event is that seriously, there are sooooooooooooooo much talents and brainpower out there in the world, even with the everyday person around us. The project I did was just one grain of sand morphed into this vast lake of sand dunes stretching thousands of miles.  All the 1400 projects there were simply impressive.  I wil see everyone on Monday.   Thomas Chen

       I agree with you Natalya. The ending of "The Great Gatsby" left me hanging also. I feel like I missed some hidden messages or themes. Mr. Selby, my ASL teacher, said he loved the book and that it made such an impact on him... Yeah, I think I'm missing something. I liked Fitzgerald's imagery throughout the book. It was really amazing. There were some very beautiful passages. I need to do some discussing with my group.

       I just got back from the Talent Show and I was really impressed by the last song by the White Bros, piano and violin really made it just ... special, so props for Ben Perry and Matt Wu. Sorry Rob, but Matt WU is way hotter than Thomas, although I have to agree that Thomas by all parameters is qualified for the title of a hottie.  I just finished "The Great Gatsby" today and I have kind of mixed feelings toward the book. I have heard a lot of people say good things about it and on the back of the book it says "American masterpiece" but my question is: what is the point of the book? I just feel dumb right now cause I didn't really find an actual point, or an underlined message or some "truth" or a "revelation." The book was really well written and was engaging, I thought it was great from the very beginning, but I somehow expected more from it and I guess the end just threw me off, as if Fitzgerald just left the book unfinished. I didn't even get it first that the last page I read was the last page of the book, I expected a "to be continued..." So I am really looking forward to a discussion of the book as soon as everyone has finished it, meanwhile Catcher in the Rye seems quite interesting, I like its colloquial style and a somewhat humorous tone, the author is great in his ability to delineate a very vivid and a realistic picture of this boy, I like the beginning: "I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened..." a nice start for the book, sort of sets you up in the right mood ... enjoy the show ... .

       I was certainly happy to hear absolutely no strange Skyview news on Monday morning.  After a big weekend like prom, I always wonder...will we be having an emergency faculty meeting?  Thankfully the answer was no.  I'm glad last week's presentations and class discussions made an impact on you.  Let the message stick.  I have been so pleased to see how well you've all supported each other through AP testing.  You have worked hard and applied yourselves, and through that process, you've been united by a shared goal.  Hang onto this; let your mutual respect for each other be the prevalent theme of your senior year.  The worst part of high school is living with the horrid restrictions that come from cliques; if you can see past those imagined lines, you won't need to live your life with a countdown.  I encourage you to come to school each day with the intent to build relationships so that by the time your ten or twenty year reunion rolls around, you'll genuinely want to go and can show up in a non-inebriated state.  Thanks, everyone, for your honest evaluations of class.  The consensus of the group was that it would have been helpful to have seen practice exams earlier in the year in order to have some context for our topics of study.  I also realized--far too late--that I could have made our SOAPS/Tone analysis more relevant for you by asking you to write essays that incorporated it.  I made the assumption that this was something you already knew, but Natalya's posting made it clear that this was something she (and probably most) had to discover.  My guess is, though, that many people haven't made this connection.  So...I know what I can do to improve.  This brings up an interesting observation in response to Thomas' posting about teachers and students.  Teachers think they're invaluable...students think they can independently learn everything they need...I believe that neither is true.  Bad teachers limit good students...A teacher can only be as good as students allow her to be. The best classrooms exist where everyone realizes that mutual responsibility is necessary.  So, as always, thanks for coming in with curiosity and a good work ethic.  As for you, Thomas...IF you have time to read and think about Catcher in the Rye, here's what you need to know.  Sydney Clos, Mina O'Brien, Matt Goosen, Mitch Amort, Chris Tamura and Tyson Cecka have signed up to read the book.  I assume you have Tyson's e-mail.  If so, find out what his group has decided upon for their reading schedule.  Wednesday and Friday will be discussion days.  On Friday, students will be turning in their book notes, which can be written in journals.  (Obviousely, you can turn in your work late.  We'll talk when you return to school.) The directions are on the syllabus.  Do you still have it?  If not, let me know and I'll get the directions to you.  We're thinking of you with pride every day!  The air circulation system has turned off and I'm starving.  Time to go.  See you all tomorrow!  Mrs. V-A

       I just wanted to tell Thomas how hot he was in his Oregonian picture.  With that kind of outward sex appeal I'm amazed that he hasn't pursued a full-time science t-shirt modeling gig.  I know that however hired him would have a customer in me for sure!  Good luck Tom and Skyview in the ISEF comp!  By the way, Catcher in the Rye isn't for everyone, if you don't like it from the start, you might want to switch because it doesn't change much.  However, some people REALLY identify with the desperate feeling of not quite fitting in with the world.  The book didn't grab me like Gatsby did, which I really enjoyed, but As I Lay Dying needs some love too, so far it's me and Kailie V and I'd like some people to share with, so think about it.  Love Rob

       Hi this is Thomas Chen posting from a HUGE GIGANTIC computer lab inside the Oregon Convention Center. Everything is going well so far,and it's an awesome place here, although I'm feeling the PRESSURE of this immense Intel ISEF competition more and more.  I had a wonderful chance already to meet people from all around the country and the world, and I have collected emblems from most states of the US and over a dozen other countries via the student pin exchange program.  I'm still assuming we are doing the book group. And Mrs.VA, I've decided to read "Catcher in the Rye". So I just need to know my book group and our agendas and plans for the week, such as what's the project all about; book notes; other works and preparations? Keep posting on the blog and keep me informed through the week.  See ya all next week.

       Just looking back at this year all I can say is that it flew by fast, way too fast to even realize that the junior year is gone... well almost gone. I think senior year will go by even faster, the more you have going on in your life the faster it seems to flow, every day is inundated with just ... life! I just have this analogy in my head: h.s. is like our salmon creek, college is like an Amazon, and after that it's an ocean, and hopefully you get into the warm current;) I am personally looking forward to the end of h.s., I just want to go out into "real" life and be sort of extricated from the feeling of being trapped in this tiny box, cause life just has so much more volume to it than we can actually see right now. I think college should be awesome, better classes, more people to meet, better professors, just feeling like you are your own person and you can do anything you want with your life. Actually when I was at Stanford our tour guide told us that students there can get as drunk as they want and have as many parties as they want as long as they don't bother anyone and don't get out of the dormitories, I think that's in a way a safer way to drink if you do drink than going out to the woods "camping." I missed the accident scene yesterday and the assembly today, but I also would like to think VA for talking to us about this issue today, it just makes it so much more personal and real when you talk about it, and I love it how our teacher actually cares about us. Really, thank you.

       I just wanted to say that I think we had a really good discussion today third period.  It was only some of us, but it was really really nice to talk about current issues within our country with other people my age, and Mrs. VA of course.  I really enjoyed it.

       I just wanted to commend Mrs. VA on a drunk-driving presentation that connected better with me than the pseudo-accident or marathon assembly.  Personal relationships are what have the most influence on peoples' lives, no matter how much pop-culture goes into an assembly.  So this weekend be safe, sober if possible, but if you do choose to drink, remember to have a plan, and that drunk-driving is NEVER the best alternative, or acceptable at all.  Once again, great job AVA, have fun but be safe!  Love, Rob  OH, by the way, Thomas mentioned some independent reading?  Could anyone fill me in on what that will entail?  And while I'm having after-thoughts, good luck to everyone that's taking their AP History tests tomorrow.  Happy Review!

       I just wanted to say that i was quite impressed with the whole 15 minutes thing. The crowd was quiet and respectful in both the commons and the parking lot and there weren't too many jokes cracked later on that day. Either something of the message got through to the general mob or i have greatly underestimated their intelligence. ...well, probably the former of those two options.   I also wanted to thank Mrs VA for the discussion we had in third period. First perioders truely missed out.   hmmm, that was oddly written. Oh well. --beck

       After two AP tests, I'm absolutely DYING to discuss some multiple choice questions... please!  Somebody!  Did you get D. on question 28 or A. on 17?  All this anti-cheating just sounds like a challenge to me.  So here's the plan for u.s., we all fabricate test booklets, replace them with the real booklets when our booklets get picked up, and mail the originals back to the College Board.  Our goal is to have to take next year's tests in facilities with prison-like security.  We'll call it operation Rebel Yell.  Anyway, one day you'll look back at high school and just admire your naievity and such, and you'll be pleasantly nostalgic, at that point you'll buy yourself a Harley and hit the road for a couple months.  As soon as H.S. ends I'll be anticipating my mid-life crisis (maybe crises), because maturity and responsibility are WAY overrated.  ENJOY IT WHILE IT LASTS!  Carpe Dium!  Much love to all bloggers for making MY h.s. experience memorable  Love, Rob

       I don't know about all of you, but I'm REALLY REALLY GLAD High School is almost over................It's time for the real college lifelong challenges. Although I have to admit that I've learned and experienced sooooooo much in the last three years.  And Here is a little vivid memory from my three days of AP tests in as many days: "Remember, the Multiple Choice questions may NEVER be discussed in any shape or form with ANYONE at ANYTIME, failure to do so may result in the invalidation of grades and possible legal actions for COPYRIGHTS VIOLATION!"  Yeah you realize from the AP test experience how much your mind has been trained to memorize stuff........because i've literally memorized the whole AP instruction script by now.   I'll see all you guys tomorrow, the only day I'll be in school for two weeks.

       As Fleckenstein would say, I pooched that test.  Which is a first class bummer, but I'm just glad to be finished.  I need to take more english in college anyway.  Anyway, yeah, you guys know we're seniors next year.  Maybe it's just me, but I still feel like we were freshlings just a short time ago, not 3 years....

       I share the relief that I am sure everyone is feeling. I can't believe how fast this year went by and I am so glad that we were well prepared for the test. I can remember reading all of the documents from or about Indians but that was almost 6 months ago. WOW this year flew by. Thomas you're stress level must be through the roof and Rachel that must have been the most fun you've ever had. Hmmmm... Sarcasm. My mind is still spewing literary terms. Ah almost time to sleep.

       Wow, you two must be taking the AP French test also. Congratulations to you two for surviving two AP tests in ONE DAY! That double test experience must've eclipsed any academic strenuous activity you've ever accomplished in your life. I can't even imagine how I would survive because I just went home and slept.  For me, the continued stress hormone pumper is still pumping strong doses into my brain, for I have four more AP tests to go, three MORE this week......Yeah I'm begging myself that hopefully I can survive like you guys too.. And have a happy stress relieving time in English class the next two weeks!

       Yeah wow... I can't even describe this feeling right now... Chad can understand what I'm talking about. After enduring about 10 hours of testing today and now having it all over.  It's undescribable.  The English test itself wasnt too bad, I think I anticipated it to be much worse, considering the practices seemed to be much more difficult than the test itself.  Also, what a relief that one of the essay prompts wasnt based on a passage.  I hope everyone else felt that they did well... Congrats on surviving the AP experience.

       Sigh..........Relief............And what not..........I can't believe three years' of English language and composition career just culminated in this huge grand assessment exam, and it's over in a flash of thought. Seems like I haven't done anything significant and it's already over......Yeah it's time to have a moment of silence........To honor all the three years of learnings we had that prepared us for this exam.  Anyways, how did everyone else feel about the test? (Remember, NEVER discuss Multiple choice questions.......lol).

       I was reading the free response essays and scoring commentaries that Thomas posted a link to and I just had a revelation: there is a purpose to SOAPS! No really, most people that got 9s or 8s used the SOAPS method, they talked about the subject (themes and ideas), occasion for the writer to write addressing this subject(s), audience whom he/she addressed, what purpose the author had when writing this piece and style of the writing including tone and rhetorical strategies. Now after two years of thinking that soaps is a waste of time I finally come to a conclusion that it is really the best way to organize your thinking and to make sure that you include everything in your essay in order to score all the possible "points." I tend to just randomly name facts as I go, mentioning the style, occasion and everything in a mix, but I think putting info in a coherent and organized manner will show the scoring person that you actually know what you are talking about, you can express in a very erudite and orderly manner and you are not just brain- storming. So my another suggestion is practice soaps, just look at some of the essay prompts on the link Thomas gave us and as you read each one of them jot down just a couple of words for SOAPS that you think you might have used if you were writing the essays at the exam.  Or better yet, relax and forget all about the test until 7:30 on Monday morning:)

       Hey Frank, go here  urlLink AP Central's English Language and Composition past essay prompts. , although you need a collegeboard Login (Which it's good and very helpful to have one).  Here is an EXCELLENT article from "KidSource Online"  urlLink that provides insights into students' attitudes in schools with survey statistics and some common misconceptions. All students and especially teachers should take the time to read this article .   This statement below from that article is VERY true:    Popular opinion has it that students' academic success depends on the quality of their teachers and textbooks. Ask the students themselves, however, and you get a different view. Here is how they account for their academic achievement:   Most students believe their ability and effort are the main reasons for school achievement. By the same token, if asked whether they would prefer to be called smart or hard-working, they will choose smart almost every time. Why? Because they believe that hard-working students risk being considered either excessively ambitious or of limited ability, both of which they would find embarrassing.

Despite a somewhat stressed out, apprehensive studying for AP Test period, we've had lots of fun in that class. We've grown both academically and socially.   So enjoy the rest of year three days of school.......Make the most out of your junior year.....Great memories will be with us forever. And old friendship and fun times may never be replaced.   Hopefully I'll see some of you again next year in AP English or AP COmparative GOvernment class!  FINALLY, KEEP THE BLOG UP THIS SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  IF YOU CAN, BLOG ANY AND ALL OF YOUR SUMMER FUNS! SHARE ALL YOUR STORIES WITH US!!!!!!!  Best Wishes  Thomas Chen

       I have been injected with some sort of spirit now that the only things left to do in English are sign yearbooks and watch Ferris.  Thanks Mrs. VA for an awesome year and such a simple yet appropriate pair of final prompts.   As far as school spirit goes this last year was not only unprecedentend and uncharacteristic of Skyview, it was also PHENOMINAL.  The key was a group of kids, mostly seniors but several juniors and sophomores as well that were willing to set aside their images (rip up their cool cards *wink*) and have fun with outfits, chants, and the good feeling they got when Skyview won.  If we want to have that kind of a fall and winter sports season again it's going to take some leadership.  Kids quickly forget how much fun it is to get G'd UP from the feet up and yell at Prairie high school, but all it takes is a key figure like Jake Valentine this year to really motivate kids.  Cheerleaders keep up the good work, but help is needed to generate school-wide spirit.  Everybody keep blogging this summer!  I'm pretty sure we'll have a summer reading list so we can talk about that, but with each passing day, November draws closer.  Love Rob

       So this is a really exciting blog, so I've decided to spice it up a bit...or at least try. I don't know if anyone has noticed, but our school generally lacks school spirit. I admit, last year was AMAZING compared to every other year I have been at Skyview, but there is still room for improvement. During cheerleading practice we were discussing different ways to implement more school spirit throughout Skyview. However, it's going to take a lot more than just 15 girls out on the sideline.  If anyone has any good ideas of how to get more of the student body involved, blog away! It will be greatly appreciated and we can have a super fun year next year being the old men (and women) on campus! Rachel Penny

       It's very true that we don't realize our milieus until we move away from them.  When I moved up here from North Carolina, there was something different.  I couldn't really describe what it was, but something in the personalities of people.  There are pretty much the same restaraunts, stores and things to do around here as there are in most areas, so i could never figure out exactly what was different.  Then I figured it out. It's the people.  For the most part, people living in the Northwest are more "natural." Like Seattle is known for being artsy, and Portland is more of a naturalist area.   Also, the first thing I noticed when I moved was the California pride.  I never understood what was so special about California. Maybe it was just being in middle school when everyone is trying to find themselves by bragging about everything possible, but California always came up as a bragging right.  It was amazing to me how many people were like, "well I'm from California!" My response was always was "your point is...?" To this day I have yet to figure out what is so special about California. Yes, it has great weather for the most part of the year, which is more than I can say for here, but I couldn't see myself just packing up my bags and moving down there.  Even given the opportunity to, I declined to move to sunny So. Cal.  Which brings up a whole nother aspect of milieu.  Families. You would be surprised how completely different people live.  Having my mom move down to California this past summer, I was completely excited to move in with the Gilfoys. Even though they seemed like a "normal" family.  I realized there is no "normal" family. (Kind of like there are no "normal" people, like Thomas stated.) I always thought that I just lived in the most "interesting" family, but every family has something different about them. After moving in with them, I have realized many small things that I love about my own family and how differently I used to live.  I guess it's kind of like leaving my family a couple years early.  Next year when most of you go off to college you think you will never miss your family and you're dying to get out of your house. Getting out of the house will be great, but trust me though, you will miss them and all of the small things, especially your own mother's cooking.  -Rachel Penny

       Ok, this blog needs to be spiced up once again. So what did everyone think of the great and rather humorous documentary?   First of all, in the film so often you'll see all the "weird" cultures, and the people in these communities/sect will be so proud of their culture and heritage and religious practices.   To go off on Mrs.VA's commment that "we don't see our own milieu when we are living in it", I believe this statement to be mostly true. If a person has never moved to a different state/country, then that person will always see himself as a "normal" human being, because they are so immersed in their culture in which they were born. But when you move, that's when you will discover your milieu, and when you move to a drastically different place you also can more objectively see the milieu of your new home. That happened to me several times already, first the culture shock when I moved from China to California, and then I then I brought an interesting mix of Chinese/California culture when I moved up here to Vancouver Washington.   Here is just a list of the many many milieus of Vancouver, if you don't realize already:  1:As Erin mentioned: "ALL THE SUBARUS AND SUVS!!!!!!"(this is a very interestiing discovery as I moved here, I guess even Georgia has much less SUVs) 2:Ski and Snowboarding Crazy(Go figure with all the outdoor opportunities here) 3:People drive soooooooo painfully slow and very carefully obeying the speed limit(Compare to California....You'd be kidding if you sped just 10mph above the speed limit....in California 50 mph 5 lane highway completely jammed with 80mphers) 4:People very much obey the law, the society as a whole is a lot more strict and calmer.(People very rarely question authority here, I can elaborate on that later).  5:The society's pace is soooooooooooo slow(downtown stores close before dark, what???? that's unbelievable in california) 6:I've never heard the word "Spendy" before I moved to Washington 7:Fast food dominates(somehow people are ok with fastfoods here) 8:All these wetlands and storm drainages(which of course the "rain milieu" of washington) And there are many many more.............Milieus and these subtle differences of cultures are what's so unique about every place, everyone of us......Catch a glimpse of New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Honolulu, Victoria(BC)......Wow what a range of different milieus.   Too often have I heard people calling each other "you are not normal", or people urging me to "just being a normal person". But I will often ask back, "what do you mean by NORMAL?". "How do you define normal????" Because "a normal" human being is different in each culture/country, and you have to have a firm grasp of the milieus of that culture to be normal. Like people will always see me tapped on with Chinese culture, even if I realize it or not. And I will not try to act like everybody else just because I want to look like "a normal person", because THERE IS NO NORMAL PERSON, especially in America.   The immigration and custom scene where people from all corners of the world feeling all patriotic and excited to become an American Citizen is simply a phenomenal picture patented for America. After all, America is a country founded on uniquenesses and differences and immigrants and we continue to pride ourselves for that. And thus in America, the world "normal" is moot and there is simply NO NEED FOR NORMAL! America has always to protrude out from the world as NOT BEING NORMAL!!!!!! In the land of the free, uniqueness is happiness; And differences drive our country forward;

       Nostalgia as a whole is vastly underrated.  Advertisors recognize its potential, filling ads with subliminally old soundtracks that put you in a good mood for being 19 once.  Nostalgia is all around.  People take pictures so they can look back 20 years from now and remember how good they looked in that sweater, or what they barbequed that fourth of July.  I myself enjoyed my own dose of nostalgia going to a concert by the Presidents of the United States of America.  They were super popular in elementary schoo with hits like Lump, Kitty, and Peaches, but took an 8 hear hiatus (sp?) at the height of their popularity.  They've reunited and played at the Rose Festival for the glorious price of FIVE DOLLARS.  I had a great time, and so did several non-blogging peers.  They played all their hits, some new ones (yay!) and even covered some Beatles, Sex Pistols, and Video Killed the Radio Star.  Rick White said it best.  I always loved PUSA, but I never dreamed I'd finally see them my senior year of High School.  Somehow I think it will be a memory he sure as hell won't forget.  Love, Rob

       I too fondly remember a time when I could fit both legs into a single pantleg of my size 30 waist JNCOs in the 4th grade.  I also remember the furious discussions with my father after covering them in grass stains playing football at recess.  It is an era I will forever remember with a twinge of longing in my heart.  I believe the same will be true once I exit high school.  In the elementary years all my friends and I could think about was reaching middle school, and now I wish I had savored those moments.  Understanding this time conundrum, I refuse to make the same mistakes twice.  Not even in the most boring, drawn out day of high school will I ever say “Man, I wish I was in college,” because I know I’ll blink my eyes and be a forty year old man sitting in a recliner in my underwear with a beer on the table and a hand in my drawls as an homage to Al Bundy.  For a seventeen-year-old that is a terrifying thought and one I’m not ready to accept, but that day is point B, and fortunately I’m still at point A.  But unlike my 11-year-old self, this time I’m going to enjoy the journey.  Today I still wear size 30 waist pants, only they fit a little differently.   -Ryan  PS – Pat and Ryan – stunning resemblance, but I think it’s Alf, (Alien Life Form)

       Pat I have to thank you for that shout out.  But i do have to condone you because Alf is spelled with fa "f" and not a "ph", if youre going to post about Alf get it right. I have had some friends in the past month bring up this fact that i do resemble Alf the tv icon.  i think its great and will make sure that this never dies.  Another thing i want to add is i loved your little peace on JNCO.  i was one of the unfortunate kids and never did have a pair because my parents thought they were hideous, but i envied everyone that had a pair.  --Alf

       First of all, praise to all of you who went to see harry potter, my respect for you is boundless.  It's interesting to hear the feedback from the movies, so no one else was disappointed that it didn't show Gryffindor winning the Quidditch cup....I was im not going to lie about it.  Yeah Yeah, the movie couldn't be that long....but why not?  Anyone who goes to see the movie most likely has some interest in the book so they will not mind staying in the theatre an extra half hour to see some vital parts of the book. I am not saying I didn't enjoy the movie-it was quality, I am just saying I stayed up till 3:30 to see a movie and it didn't even have quite possibly one of the most important parts of the book in it.  So ya, enough about that. Now that thats over with, I would like to give a shout out to Ryan Vasbinder for his stunningly real portrayal of Alph, the TV icon, in the late 80's and early 90's.

           What's every person here thinking about Clark's party? It'd be cool, and I'll certainly enjoy sending her off. I liked having her as a teacher. I'll miss VA more though (if you're reading Mrs. VA, someone's paying me to say this). It's been great having her two years straight and seeing my writing grow, as well as having her watch the progression and help me through it. I know that there's some of you who've had her for three years and are ready for a new teacher, and I see your point. I find it interesting the difference between last year and this year. It's a difference which struck me when I was looking for stuff to write my PDP's on. I'm glad how she conducted the class this year; it was very worth while.      Poor Alex is right here next to me. It's Clark's 2nd period, and she still can't access either one. I'm guessing that all of you are very ready to just leave. The will to work is leaving, and I really just don't want to do to much. I'm ready to hop that plane to Germany, head off to my summer concerts, not as ready to do side work (but will somehow), and just slide into next year. It won't be so easy, especially all this college stuff, but I'm ready to start anew with senior year. I really just want to throw away all the college stuff that isn't Washington; I'm not really interested in leaving the state, and I'm even less interested now. It's not smart to trash the stuff yet, but sometimes I don't want to be smart.      Anywho, I'm going to check scholarships or the US blog. Till next time - Adios and God bless.

       For someone who has never read Harry Potter, never seen Harry Potter, not because I don't like them, I've just never been interested, the latest movie was very entertaining.  I've finally picked up the sorcerer's stone, which I think is the first book(someone tell me) that has been sitting on my shelf for an eternity and decided to read it so I think that's telling about the movie.  I enjoyed it, definately a visual feast and fun.  Even not knowing the background the story was simple enough to understand.  Is that kid who had the blonde hair and was a little biatch in the first 2 movies?

       I have also seen the new Harry Potter.  Although some people are disappointed in the movie, I thought it was actually good.  There is no way they would be capable of putting the entire book into a movie.  However, if I hadn't read the books, some parts would have been a little bit confusing.  The only disappointment I had with the movie was that they never really explained the map in full detail.  If you are they type of person who only goes to see the movies, or if you just haven't been caught up in the HP frenzy, then I highly suggest you read the books. The movies are good but they would never be able to give the books the justice they deserve. The first book takes a while to get into, but it is definitly worth the energy. Rachel Penny

       I spent the entire weekend basically watching Godfather, and thus coming to a conclusion that I am in love with Al Pacino and that therefore I shall go to a cloister unless I meet a prince on a white horse who will be an identical twin of Al, but preferably a couple of years younger (about 40...). Al Pacino is the greatest actor in the history of man and is a true inspiration. After watching the first two movies I was going to resign as the KGB princess sure that my destiny is to become a mafia godmother, but with all my regret I have to admit that the third movie sort of disillusioned me with the tragic life of mafiosi families, so thus I decided to stay in KGB for a while and then maybe go to a monastery once I am too old to search for my prince Al Pacino's YoungerTwin:( Anyway I encourage all of you who have not seen the movie to see it, believe me that you shall not regret the nine hours of your life spent to see the greatest classic of all time.  I saw HP3 this weekend also and I have to admit that I was very impressed with the new director and that I actually really liked the movie unlike that first two:) I agree with Rob that the movie's main improvement was that it was fast, entertaining and much more like the book. I couldn't believe that it was over so fast though, I want more now:) I think we should open a club in our school, called something like "HP Nerds, Unite!":)

       Bethany, your parody brought me back to the days when I used to live near Seattle with your description of Puget Sound.  After reading your parody, I was reminded of a part in Huckleberry Finn, I don't know if you remember but Mrs. V-A called it the "mini-vacation" or something like that.  It was the scene in Huckleberry Finn where Twain is describing the sun rising over the river.  Your clear and thorough description of the events taking place and the surroundings is what brought me to recollect this scene in Huckleberry Finn.  Also, I applaud you on writing a parody-that can be a lot more challenging than cranking out a compare/comtrast paper.  So, in essence, as a Compton native would say "mad props to you, it was off the hizzle fo shizzle"

       Hey, great action on the blog and I'm sorry I don't have time to post on that right now, but it's 330 in the morning.  I'm up because I saw the greatest wizard/witch-based movie of all time— Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban.  It was my favorite book, but I loved one and two as well and I didn't think the movies had entirely done them justice.  The new one is just that; new.  The new director, Alfonso Cuaron (something like that, he directed Y tu Mama Tambien) did an absolutely fabulous job making some changes that made the first movies lose a little magic (pun intended) compared to the books.  For instance, robes are worn only once that I can recall, being replaced by jeans and sweaters, making the characters more comparable to the muggle adolescents in the audience.  Also, Draco Malfoy, though still hateable, is now a coward in the face of confrontation.  He takes on the role of a character like Wylie Coyote in the fact that he had malicious intentions, yet always ended with a frying pan bent around his face.  Lastly, Pat said that it didn't always follow close to the book.  Don't get it twisted— none of the story was altered, however, in the interest of time, much quidditch is subtracted in place of plot advancement, which is entirely ok, because the foreshadowing is MUCH better orchestrated than in previous movies, making it much MORE like the book in that sense.  If you can't tell, I LOVED IT.  It was funny, fast, and satisfyingly sentimental.  I'll see it again w/ anyone that wants to go.  A word to the wise, I might be a little grumpy with the mere 3 hours of sleep I plan on getting, so if you must talk to me, PLEASE let the topic be Harry Potter.  Kahli Veys was there too, so if she's at school, she too can fill you in on the glory that is HP.  May all your sleeping patterns be much more consistant than mine,  Love Rob

       Umm ya, its about 3:06 in the morning and i just got home from seeing harry potter.  I am seriously tired, but I thought it would be important to blog to share the improvement of the third movie in comparison to the previous two.  Go see it, its better.  It doesn't follow the book as strict as some would like, but it makes for a quality flick.

       Hideeho Bloggeroonies  I same to be borrowing a page from Ned Flanders on that one. What's going one you probably all asleep people? I know that lots o' people are off at that Harry Potter opening, my little sister included.   Bethany, I'd like to read that parody gig sometime, it'd be cool to see. It can take time to write a nice parody, or a nice thing in general. I'm still trying to finish up my Stalin/Spongebob parody (it's almost done, and thank God I finally have an idea for the ending!). It's fun to write these things, and we all have our different styles, and practice makes perfect, so don't worry. Also, true dat about leaning on God. Coming to him makes us realize how stupid materialism, selfishness, etc. can really be, if we take time to be sincere and thoughtful with him.   Speaking of said parody, it's at the center of what I want to do for my senior project. I'd like to direct and produce it next year, try and make it part of a student-written winter one-acts show that we've had in the wings throughout this school year. I know Megan might be interested in writing a piece. My thesis'll center around different styles and methods of directing, but the project is what I'm really interested in. VA really liked that I'm going to do it, and she's been encouraging in telling me to do a project that is important to me. I've worked almost all school year on my play (named Stalinpants = Stalin + Spongebob Squarepants), so it'll be a great way to tie that in to something like senior project. Hope some of you guys might be interesting in trying out next year. We'd love to have you in any of the shows, and Stalinpants specifically has a large cast, so you'd have a nice chance of getting a part.  Anywho, I find it interesting that we've got senior boards next year. I can totally understand though why some juniors last year were quick to decorate themselves and their cars in Senior '04 stuff. It'll be a fun year (pre-nostalgic sigh). Anywho, I'm going get going, and maybe go to bed sometime soon; most likely. Till next time. Adios and God bless.  Tristan the Yeehawman.

       "Anthem" Ayn Rand  "I am. I think. I will.  My hands.... My spirit.... My sky.... My forest... This earth of mine.  It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. It is my mind which thinks, and the judgment of my mind is the only searchlight that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is the only edict I must respect.  Whatever road I take, the guiding star is whithing me, the guiding star and the loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to me.  I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but  a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no nigher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its on goal. It is its own purpose.  And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peacs and pride.  This god, this one word: "I"

       (Ego translates as "I" from Greek) I have never asked myself that question before, the answer always seemed to be: duh... evil! Of course until... I read the Fountainhead, which I finally finished today and have successfully proclaimed to be my Bible:) Although it is as radical in its ideas as any philosophical book could possibly get, the philosophy is integrated in a great, crazy story of an architect: the greatest egotist alive, a man of highest level of integrity. And here is what he says at his trial before the collectivist/altruist world accusing him of being an egotist:     "The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man's first duty is to himself. His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes.     "From the beginning of history ,the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the second-hander. The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive.      "The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of compulsion. It demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are secondary. Second-hander declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. No man can live for another.      "Men have been taught dependence as a virtue. The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption.     "Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Men have been taught that it is virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator is the man who stands alone. Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But the creator is the egotists in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, judge, or act. These are functions of the self.      "The egotist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man - and he asks no other man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men.      "You can fake virtue for an audience. You can't fake it in you own eyes. Your ego is the strictest judge. It's easier to donate a few thousand to charity and think oneself noble than to base self-respect on personal standards of personal achievement."     "People are not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander's delusion - prestige. They don't say "This is what I wanted because I wanted it, not because it made my neighbors gape at me." The only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. If one doesn't respect oneself one can have neither love nor respect for others.      "The only thing that matters, my goal, my reward, my beginning, my end is the work itself. My work done my way. A private, personal, selfish, egotistical motivation."     "I never think of myself in relation to anyone. I just refuse to measure myself as part of anything."     "I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. I am a man who does not exist for others. The integrity of a man's creative work is of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a slave society."    "Is sacrifice a virtue? Can a man sacrifice his integrity? His honor? His freedom? His ideal? His convictions? The honesty of his feelings? The independence of his thought? But these are a man's supreme possessions. Anything he gives up for them is not a sacrifice but an easy bargain. Self-sacrificed? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed."

       Hey guys!  So, I know that I'm a little behind the times with the blog, but I just wanted go back to Pat's thing on the essays and sharing them with each other.  I think it's a really good idea, especially for people in the other classes to share essays about the same books.    Anyways...Pat, I thought that your essay was really good.  It reminded me of how materialistic America has become, and we all get swept up in it.  As much as you think you don't, I'm sure that all of you have.  I mean, we all go to Skyview, and none of us seem to be doing that poorly.  I mean, my parents both of decent jobs, we live in a pretty nice house, and we have enough food and clothes and things.  I just throw myself a pity part sometimes, when I go over to a friend's house who lives in Ashley Heights or has a closet full of nice clothes, or wears a different outfit every day...it makes it really hard to be content with what you have and to not be dissatisfied.  But (I'm gonna be religious here), as long as you lean on God, you should never be dissatisfied with what you have.  And that's something that I struggle with, but that your essay reminded me of.  So, thanks Pat.  I wrote a parody, and it's not too bad.  It follows these few pages in "Their Eyes Were Watching God," and it's a really amazing part of the book that I wanted to try to recreate.  It was hard, so I'm not sure how good my parody is.  Read it, see what you think of it!  But I've gotta go.  All of the Junior Project stuff is do tomorrow...I should start.  Bye!  Bethany          Mary looked up at her with hungry eyes, only wanting to listen to the unfolding story of her Mom’s life. Sarah looked around as her eyes slowly took in the summer surroundings.  Bees swimming drunkenly from flower to flower, the sun slowly dipping into the Puget Sound, and the gentle crash of waves on the shore.  She smiled and gazed down at her patient daughter.  Mary’s unanticipated interest in Sarah’s teenage years inspired her to tell her story.      She thought of where to begin, and her eyes glanced heavenwards.  The afternoon sunlight danced through the branches of the weeping willow tree and made playful shadows oh Mary’s excited face.  Sarah sighed with content, and decided to begin at the time when she first imagined that maybe she wasn’t a little girl anymore- that maybe she was growing into something greater.  She decided to tell Mary about the time she swam in the ocean at midnight.      It was a warm, summer evening on Whidbey Island.  Sarah had spent the evening roasting s’mores over a beach fire and singing songs with her family.  Every evening of that weeklong vacation, she had been on the beach.  She spent every moment walking along the shore, but at night liked to listen to the waves crash on the rocks, slowly churning beach glass and barnacles into sand.  The ocean called to her, like a mystery that needed to be unearthed.  Not in the way that the ocean calls to a sailor, but she was mesmerized by the intense drifting current and the white foam that disappeared after only moments on the rocky shore.  It inspired her.  How?  Why?  It was like a beat lost long ago, in another time, drifting across the ocean to meet her.  What?  How?  Why?  The song of the ocean was not a real song, yet the salt sea air made her drunk to the world.  It followed her through her every move, and it pleasantly haunted her dreams and thoughts.  The ocean sang to her, the waves the symphony and the air its conductor.  It seemed to connect her to a place or time almost unreal; her observations became acute and alive.  Things that she had not noticed suddenly became vivid and momentous.  They were unearthed and filled her mind and conscience.      She took a few steps towards the water, admiring the sparkling rocks and glistening water.  Although her father’s guitar was now safely inside the cabin, the song still swayed in her mind, a friend in the warm night.  Suddenly the guitar, waves, and air were all playing together in harmony; a melody so strong and inspiring yet so soft and beckoning that she could hardly contain herself.  She fell against the soft sand and stared at the stars, twinkling happily in the dark sky.  Why had she never noticed them before?  The song of the ocean controlled her; she closed her eyes and seemed to float closer and closer towards heaven and the stars.  Did the waves always make music?  Did the moon always make the water sparkle like diamonds?  Yes, but not for her.  Tonight was her night.  She felt limp and drunk with flying towards heaven and listening to earth’s song. 	    After awhile she stood up and looked across the Sound.  She was seeking some sort of confirmation of her vision, her dream, her revelation.  She received her answer.  The water nodded its agreement, the waves roared its truth, and the stars shone in affirmation. The waves rushed over her bare feet, a usually chilling sensation that now left her smiling with indescribable warmth.  She waded into the water.  About to dive in, she glanced back at the cabin where here parents and siblings were sleeping.  She turned around and dove into the cold water.  She was seventeen!  She was a dancing star and a singing wave, turning over and over in the ocean.  Was the sky so joyful for her?  Nothing answered.  She searched the heavens, floating across the waves in the water.  Looking, waiting, breathing short with impatience.  She stood and looked around her; the world was made in a new light.

       The school food actually sounds like a good idea. Or how about how it's not healthy to have to eat within 30 minutes? If you go out to lunch by the time you get there you only have 10 minutes to eat before you have to leave.  It took me forever to decide what topic I wanted to do. However, once I picked it seemed like good topics came up everywhere, it's crazy how that always seems to happen.  I finally chose to do the benefits of extracurricular activities. It's actually interesting how being involved in an after-school club or sport is related to higher test scores and better attendence. It'd be interesting to see what everyone else came up with for their junior project. Have a fun time with all the nice weather while it lasts!   - Rachel Penny

       So, this is my first time blogging for English class, whoohoo!  This is very exciting.  I don't quite know what to say, there really isn't a whole lot of controversial stuff to talk about here like there is in Clark's class.  What is everyone doing their Junior Project on?  I'm doing how disgusting and unhealthy school food is, because honestly...yuck!  The deep fried fries and extremely greasy pizza everyday, that needs to stop eventually.  Paul, I totally agree with you about how it's hard to keep your mind engaged on school when you do nothing in other classes...ah!  I don't know what to do with myself, I have absolutely no motivation to do anything.  What a great attitude, right? Haha.  Anyway, I'll see all you kids at school tomorrow!

       Rob I commend you on your idea.  Most students won't be able to vote on their own, I for one(missed the cut off by 2 weeks).  Paul, your recomendation on Ma$e's new song is superb, I heard it last Saturday and recognized the unique lyrics and smooth, calm vocals, so I had a feeling it was Ma$e.  Do you know if that was a single, or if it is part of a CD?

       Gosh, I remember JNCO's.  4th grade, had to get me a pair, couldn't afford it, I was a very sad little boy.  I remember them having innovative tee-shirts too.  Amazing how everything changes, since I don't think any of us would go near JNCO's now.  Are they even still around?  I think your skyview votes for the vote idea is very innovative, it's the kind of idealistic idea I'd expect to read about in Newsweek or something...  Oh the possibilities.  Is anybody else having trouble focusing their energy.  We have work in this class, clarks(somewhat), and my math class.  But everything else, especially my 3rd and 4th periods, are nothing.  It's really hard to keep a work minded mind not having to do any work.  I love summer, but I hate the mindless feeling I get from it.  I always like to have my energy focused on something.  I think I'm going to end up being one of those guys who can't bring themselves to retire, and when they have to they hate it and go back to work after 8 months.  Closing note, Ma$e- bling bling- is back.  Everyone needs to go listen to 'Welcome Back', who else can you see sampling the welcome back kotter song?  It's actually very good, and he hasn't given up on his preaching, which is cool.  But it's definately a break from the all the mindless club music I hear all the time now.

       i think that would be a good idea.  there is no way to have a student government that completely represents the school, but your idea is definitely an improvement.  seeing as this is my first year at skyview, sometimes it seems like asb doesn't really do anything aside from blatantly violating the dress code and getting away with it.  perhaps that's just me being cynical about the way things work.  haha.  go for it buddy, anything is worth a try.

       Rob, what you will be doing is unprecedented, unique, and first of its kind.(For that matter you can patent this ingenius idea.......JK.....or at the least claiming your originality of that idea as your intellectual property).   But seriously, if I interpreted your message correctly, I think core concept is to get more young people our age involved in politics, the political process, and especially how the political process works in a democratic society - with the funamentals manifested in the act of voting. We all realize the age group of 18-21 represent the lowest percentage of elligible voters that actually vote in an election. For some odd reasons young people our age just does not care about policies of our nation(Heh when there is a draft I bet a lot more people will vote then, but then again it's too late by then).   Youngesters, take your legitmiate part of control over the government!!!!!!!! We do not want the same old/senile/retired generals and shrewd politicians dictate our lives and draft us to be killed in some unknown regions of the world without our consent!!!!!!!!!!  I support the statement that those who do not vote does not deserve complaints.   THUS............GO VOTE, AT ANY OPPORUNITY YOU CAN.......AND THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US WHO ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION A TASTE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS!!!!!!!  TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR YOUNG LIVES AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE THROUGH THE ACT OF VOTING!  And finally, people on the AP Fest party committee, please blog in and speakout about your plans and what activities are we going to have.......or is it a secret surprise party?

       Maybe it's because it's one in the morning, but I had a thought that intrigued me a lot.  I was thinking a little bit about how representative the ASB is of the students— and it's basically trust on behalf of the student body that gives the governing body "artistic license" to run the school as it sees fit.  There are no referendums, and although meetings are open to the entire student body to sit in on, nobody ever does, or probably even knows it's an option.  In an effort to make my presidency more directly representative as well as continue my theme of the importance of democratic participation, I would like to have the school vote on how I should vote in the elections held this November.  It would be one vote representing the entire school, and it would sacrifice my own voice, but I think mock campaigning in school for candidates at all government levels would expand the knowledge and interest in politcs of the school: a heritage that would be far more valuable than the vote I would cast on my own.  With a fervor that hinges on administrative support, I would like to pursue this concept.  What does everyone think?  I want comments from both students and their parents on this one.  But not Mike Rush, he is an ignorant Pig-Dog who deserves no respect from anyone.  (Mike demanded I begin trash talking on the blog).  Secondly, I want to organize a large-scale trivial pursuit contest- who would be down to participate?  Trivial Pursuit will be the next big thing in this school and nobody wants to miss out on this.  May democracy live long and prosper.  Love Rob  P.S.  Create Blogger profiles, they are kinda fun to do and give ME something to look at when I'm insomniacing

       Whatever happened to the greatest corduroy company of all time?  JNCO.  The name radiates a sense of "gangster."  In the grunge era of the mid 1990's, bands such as the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana influenced me, as a elementary schooler, to pursue such the novel brand of JNCO.  Now if you are pronouncing it JUH-N-COH, start pronouncing it JEEN-COH.  During this time of my life, others strayed to other brands such as Lee Pipes-a jean that went straight down and was usually ridiculously baggy.  Another blogger, Rob Muilenburg recalls JNCO's by stating "they changed my elementary life in a time when I hated Phil Sobolowski"  Yes, Rob, I agree with you, they did also change my life.  The JNCO scriblle will always live on as long as there is the memory.

       Hello!  I arrived at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth on Sunday night and am enjoying a new climate, new colleagues and new sights.  Since Thomas asked about summer reading, I thought I would answer.  Mr. Wargo and Mrs. Grey-Hatton will be teaching the senior AP classes next year.  They have not assigned you any summer reading.  However, take advantage of your freedom and free time this summer and read on your own.  Your primary focus next year will be British literature and poetry.  Perhaps this summer you can indulge yourself in more modern fiction.  You might want to focus on prize-winning book lists like Pulitzer Prize winning novels or Booker Prize winners.  Or focus on modern writers from around the world.  Another option to consider is set yourself up with a book list of classics, because I guarantee you that you'll be in lit classes in college and wish you'd taken better advantage of your free time as people allude to books and authors you've heard of (maybe) but don't really know.  A few books I'd recommend?  Reading Lolita in Tehran The God of Small Things Persopolis Love in the Time of Cholera Anything by Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Ibsen, Woolf, Hardy, Neruda Red Azalea Germinal  Have fun reading, be safe, and have a happy summer!  Mrs. V-A

        I just finished my six weeks of intense math camp.........And a short two and half day ASB Leadership camp!!!!!!!!!! Wow...........Way too much to say............... The math camp has elevated my life to a new dimension, with numerous epiphanies occuring and many new friends and bonds made. And many valuable lessons I've learned from math camp, including the fact that I felt incredibly stupid when I was immersed in a sea of of 23 geniuses. And how important friendship and "constructive" competition is. And that's besides all the six week full time math we learned.   I miss the university setting soooooooooooooooooo incredibly much!!!!!!!!!!! I wish I could just be a college student and live in the McMahon dorm from now on for the next few years! Home only brings me the memories of stress, depression, loneliness.............and what not. While the math camp at the university was completely motivational, stress-free, fun......Fun together with learning/bonding experience.   Otherwise, the ASB retreat was mostly a taste of what we have to do next year, the responsibilities we have, the goals we have, and the people we are going to working with. It was quite interesting.........We'll see next year............Although I seriously wish Ms.Clark was still here!      Thomas Chen
