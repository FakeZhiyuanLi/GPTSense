      Its amazing what "getting something off your chest" can do. I feel tons better as I write this. I have had way too many feeling bottled up inside. Now that they are released, I am looking at life fresher again. I am glad that everyone that has listened to my crap, has been there. You know who you are. Lets hope tommorow is a day of fun. And that things in the future can remain exciting and fresh like the days of old.

      I have started doing some exercises (gasp!) lately, mostly push-ups and sit-ups and I have noticed something. Excercising is only for the single and bored (or insane). I mean who wants to waste time working? Its gotta be one step above alsolute boredom, which I seem to be experiencing. Being so bored also let me understand the power of blogging (another tool of the single and bored). I have never updated my site this regularly, is it a good thing? Well, if your reading this trash, then I suppose it is. Wow, I just re-read all that and I have no idea what I was trying to say. I gotta go finish my reps. Peace.

      Sometimes I wish life was a video game. So I could cheat at it. Imagine being able to redo things because you messed up somewhere, or type INEEDCASH and have assloads of money appear and wouldn't it be great to skip this level and see what happens next without waiting? Maybe all this technology is no good. Its creating waves of impatient people. I pride myself on having enormous amounts of patience, however lately I am the most impatient person I have ever met. Something’s gotta happen soon, right? If not please email me the code for the next level. I am getting impatient here!

      I think I am getting an ulcer, my stomach is killing me today! My weekend was all gravy. I had a great time on friday night eating some dinner at the cali cafe and catching a friday night feature. Sat was also a really cool (but hot!) day at the manayunk arts festival. In the blazin heat I managed to snag 2 really sweet peices. Both with a similar theme of graffiti. Sat night I headed out to NYC to play some video games, lol. And sunday I went to Red Bank, NJ to visit Kevin Smiths store  urlLink Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash , which sucked as a comic shop, but was full of movie memoribila. Unfortuanly I had to end the good times with the pain in my stomach (and a slight headache from missing my coffee today).   Pics I bought this weekend -  urlLink 14x14  and  urlLink 24x16 .

      So, I was listening/watching one of my great xmas gifts, the Beastie Boys Videos Boxed Set - Critereon Collection, which to my surprise contains no Licensed to Ill songs (Def Jams fault), however worse is the fact that the songs are censored!! WTF? This is the Beastie Boys. I was utterly crushed.      Ever have something stange happen in Windows XP, for example stuff that was in the right-click menu are missing? Go to Start->Run and type: regsvr32 shimgvw.dll

      What was I doing without HBO for so long. Now that comcast offered it to me for $7/month (on top of the $112/month I already pay). I can watch Curb Your Enthusiam till my eyes drip gore. I am watching them in order, and finally reached episode 28 - Krazy Eyez Killah. LOL. classic. What else is on the channel thats good?

      I have done absolutly nothing for 4 days but relax and enjoy beimg a lazy slug. Just what I needed to start the new year. I did manage to get out to see Big Fish by Tim Burton. What ever happened to Mr. Burton, I mean he used to be known for dark gothic flims, now he just makes crap. I guess the dark juices stopped flowing. Oh, and I finally got a haircut after 6 months!

      Now you will receive us. We do not ask for your poor or your hungry. We do not want your tired and sick. It is your corrupt we claim. It is your evil that will be saught by us. With every breath we shall hunt them down. Each day we will spill their blood ‘til it rains down from the skies. Do not kill, do not rape, to not steal. These are principles, which every man of every faith can embrace. These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption, into our domain. But if you do you, one day you will look behind you and you will see we three, and on that day, you will reap it. And we will send you to whatever god you wish. And shepherds we shall be, for thee my Lord for thee, power hath descended forthfrom thy hand, that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. We shall flow a river forth to thee, and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In nomine patrie, Et fili, Spiritus sancti.  -Boondock Saints

You have a sweet plan or one that stinks? Lemme know in the comments!

      Did you ever notice that when your a kid you can watch the same movie like 300 times without getting bored of it. Why do you grow out of that phase? I used to watch Condorman with my brother till our eyes we dry and crusted in blood, and we never got sick of it. Now if I even see the opening credits of something I have already seen, and I am already grabbing the remote. Maybe when your a kid your expectations are low and you assume every movie must suck as much as the last one you just watched. Maybe those kids are on to something...then again maybe not....

      Ahh yes, its the wonderful time of the year where its reversed and the govt gives us money back. Luckily this year I got back more than I was expecting which is going to finance my trip to Aruba later in the year. Hopefully everyone else is in the black and is not getting a night time raid from the IRS and Uncle Sam.

      I refuse to update becuase I am so lazy in getting the site switched over to the new design. But here is past few weeks have included catching a wild loose dog, skinning the palms of my hands, new computer toys, finding out I had a dermal fibrosum(sp?) and getting it burned off, finally getting some sleep, trying new beers, season premeires of Sopranos and The Shield, and more. Feel free to ask any questions you may have. I need to work up the motivation to push live the new design.

      Fuck I hate spam, for you old folks, I am not refferring to that overly saltly horse meat in a can. I am talking about the never ending tide of people hawking the penis pills, diplomas and overseas casinos. Fine, I have accepted the fact we get junk mail, I don't even see the subject in my inbox anymore, I delete them so fast. But whats really gotten my goat lately is these fucknuts attacking my site. First it was spamming my comments with their website urls, so I disable comments after a week or so, and banned their IPs from commenting. Now its them spamming my REFERRERS page! Fine, I upgraded the script (luckily the folks at textism.com were aware of this already), working the php to prevent mass fake refferers, dumping my database, yadda yadda yadda. Then I banned them from reffering AND from ever visiting my site. Fine. Right. Wrong. Apparently my site (a solid 6/10 google page rank) is high enough in google where people are creating FAKE sites of with MY NAME as the keywords! Take a look at a simple google seach for my name...  So I looked more into this and found a bunch of other sites being affected like these: site, site, site, site, site, site, site, site all from a simple google seach. It seem that this program Referrer Advertising System 2004 (yes, someone wrote a program to do this) was responsible

      Hot damn, Dieselboy's new album Dungeonmster's Guide is about to drop, preview it here. Tour dates also up, check me out at the philly show, bitches.  Update: Well, I finally got a chance to sit down and really listen to the new CD and its quite a new direction for the genre. This CD isn't so much as what you expect from a Drum n Bass CD, its really pushing the current standards and limits by mixing trance, dnb and electro breaks into a jazzy soundscape. Its not a CD you turn on and then tune out, its a complete audio experience thats best listened to from start to finish. With alot of the tracks being older songs remixed for the CD you also get a strange sense of nostalgia from the beats and sounds of some of the better tunes from the past years. All in all its a really good CD, however its not a really good DnB CD, Dieselboys past CDs are good examples of that (ie. Soldiers Story and System Upgrade), but this is the cutting edge of electronica and I plan on turning it up.  Rating: 8/10

People are selling there beta accounts on ebay for $50+, yes free email accounts selling for those prices. Anyway, I check my blogger account hourly (supposedly they are giving advanced accounts to blogger members). Whatelse is a nerd supposed to do?

      My new projects that I am trying to complete are as follows: Spring cleaning in my apartment. I mean like a total every room, closet, box, etc. Also switching out the winter clothes and bringing out those summer ones. But a larger hard drive into my Xbox, I currently have a 40 gigger in there, but with games weighing in at 3-5 gigs its fills up fast. I have a stack of about 5-7 harddrives in my closet including a 80 gig that will work quite nice. Upgrade the Tivo's harddrive. With me getting more into a couple of shows and trying to tape shans stuff the 30hrs are constantly full. I am gonna buy a 120 gig drive which should give the tivo 120 hours on medium quality and 84hours on best quality. It all sounds like fun, well except for the cleaning part...

      Well, it seems I accidently left my Axim on for too long which drained the battery and erased all my stuff. Today I will be reinstalling all my apps, here are some more that I find useful. WisBar Advanced converts your almost useless menu into something functional, its the first thing I install. Next up is SysWatch which puts your memory, cpu usage, etc. into the system tray so you can always keep an eye on it. Next up I install basically everything from PHM including PocketPC Plus, Powertoys, Regedit and Device Manager. There are a few more I install, however I will update this post later in the day

      I was playing the E3 Alpha of GuildWars which looks quite intresting. The Graphics engine they are using is really nice and there is an almost painterly feeling to the game. Its like a 3d diablo style type game from what I can tell so far, the free preview is only available for a few days so check it out. I also have some screen shots which you can view below.

      I was having my doubts about this award winning game when I was about 1/2 though the main story line. I just recently started playing again in the desolute barren wake of no games out to play. I must say however, that just after the mid point Knights of The Old Republic really picks up the story line, you gain tons of force powers and I am really enjoying trying to get to the end of the story line. Pick this one up if you haven't played it yet and are looking for something to tide you over till HL2, DOOM3, STALKER, etc.

      One of the more difficult things I fought with trying to get this css layout, was the different margins that IE6 and Mozzilla display for the same margin width. A 15px width margin is alot smaller in Mozzilla than in IE with was causing the middle and right columns to press up against the left most edge. Below is the solution I found to fix this:  #maincol{  float: left; width: 476px;  background-color:#fff; margin: 8px 0px 8px 15px; padding: 0px; border: 1px solid #ccc; }  html>body #maincol { /* these margins affect Mozilla and Safari */  margin: 8px 0px 8px 31px; }  html>body #maincol is a selector thats valid CSS code that IE6 dosen't read, so the rule of margins gets overwritten on Mozilla and Safari browsers.

After nearly 20 years "Kaufman" started and blog and submitted an interview and new photos to the internet to prep his big return to the world. Believe it or not, its makes for damn good gossip, linkage follows:  Yahoo:http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/040519/234/726q1.html  MSNBC:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4933551/  His Blog:http://andykaufmanreturns.blogspot.com/  Snopes:http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/kaufman.asp

      Seems like blogger is giving away gmail invites again. If your an active (lucky) user, just sign in and look on the right hand side to see if you've won the gmail lottery!  On a side note, I feel for all you unlucky folks with cars. Here in philadelphia your lucky to find stations charging $2.10/gallon some of the well places gas stations are charging upwards of $2.20/gallon this week! And the worst part is, the prices are supposed to continue to rise even higher.

      A very hot weekend, with the daytime high hitting 92 degrees over the weekend. With some free time on saturday I finally beat KoTOR (my first game beaten on the xbox). Sunday, Shannon and I walked about 20 blocks to the ASPCA cat and dog fair over on boathouse row. It was a beautiful day to be walking around one of the better parts of Philadelphia. I wish I had taken my camera and snapped some photos.
