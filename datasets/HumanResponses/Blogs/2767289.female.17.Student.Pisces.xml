      The concert was AMAZING!!!  I wish I could experience this again!  I absolutely   loved   all the songs Josh sang!!!  My favorites, though, were My December, Oceano, Mi Morena, Remember When It Rained, and Never Let Go.    After the concert, Alisa, Catherine and Serge and I went over to stand next to the busses and wait for Josh to come out.  Surely, he did, but he just waved and blew kisses and hopped into the bus.  I understand its for health reasons and really because they had to leave for CA.  But anywho... we met the band (which is the next best thing, hehheh) and got their autographs and pictures.  Wow.  I never realized how easily approachable they are!  They're sooo nice!   Well...I still can't get over the fact that I have seem Josh LIVE!!!  It might take a while before I come down from cloud 9... heeheehee!!

      How weird...  I just got a message from someone saying "Hi, you don't know me, but I just wanted to say hi..."  Strange thing... it was a phone number from ARKANSAS!!!  Whoa!  I just got a phone call from ARKANSAS!!  LoL.   *** I'm feeling kinda down.  I checked Ticketmaster and the only tickets available to Josh's concert is the lawn.  The LAWN!!!  I don't know if I should buy them now, or wait till the concert date and see if I can get   better   seats... *sigh*  I had a wacky dream last night.  Usually I don't get crazy dreams... that's Alisa's and Catherine's thing.  (inside joke).  But Josh was in it! He was in my living room, and he gave me a nice hug and two tickets to his concert!!!  LoL.  It was sooo real!  I know I'm sounding dilusional... aaaggh!! *** 1)Saw two of Mr. Groban's photos in the Willamette Week. 2)Message from Arkansas! 3)100% on my Anatomy Exam!  Carpe Diem!!

      I just happened to stumble upon a   pitiful   show on WB tonight.  It's called something along the lines of "Superstar USA."  They've pretty much stolen American Idol's "idea."  But with a twist!  A really horrible twist!  They hold singing auditions, but they only choose the WORST singers!  They give them hopes that they are PHENOMENAL!  And apparently, once they build up their ego, they will let them know that it was all a prank.  How horrible is this??  How   low   can these producers go??  Is this what America wants to see?  People being humiliated, laughed at!!  These judges just sit there and LIE to these poor souls!  Tsk tsk...  Oh, speaking of American Idol... I hope Fantasia wins.  There's something about Diana that I dislike... But yeah... that's my spiel.  As for my daily happy list... 1)"G'morning, Hollywood." 2)I found out the chords for "Million Years From Now". 3)Got more funky lookin' shades, heehee!!

      Knowing me, you would probably see that I try to make the most in life.  I try to notice those little things, that eventually make a really big difference.  Say for instance those little tiny things that make us happy each day... So... I was thinking I should list at least 3 things that made me happy each day. Here's 3 for today: 1)Tim got me funky lookin' glasses 2)Chinese convenience-store guy 3)Guitar teacher...really cool guy...  I'm actually planning on listing these things everyday--that way, I could learn to appreciate those little tiny things that people often times pass by and aren't able to see the beauty of life!  Make it a good day!

      I am thinking of starting a seperate blog...  I really feel the need to thank Mr. Fitz.  I don't know what it is... actually there is ALOT of things about him, but I really admire and respect him... more than any other professor I have/had.  So, eventually, when I gradute, maybe during my graduation speech, or after, I am planning on saying a great-big-huge THANK YOU to him.  And so this new blog that I am contemplating on, I guess I'll just gather my thoughts and then put it all together into a beautiful speech/letter, heh, heh, heh.   *** So it seems like things have been getting a   little bit   better between Serge and I.  We're getting to that point where we're starting to talk... small conversations, but still... Oh God!  This seems sooo immature of us!  I know!  But I can't go on without someone to hang out with... all my other siblings are never around, and he's the only one who's kinda my age, and he really does understand me...in some cases... I try and try to be patient with his "bad" side, but there are just those times that enough is enough and I burst out and tell him, and it all just crashes from there....blah!!!  Anywho, for all it's worth, I love my brother, and hopefully nothing like this will ever try to anger us again... *** I've got this awesome book at Presents of the Mind.  It's a wish list.  Haha!  There's like 6,000 things to do in life.  Really neat.  Kinda makes me think tough... once you accomplish all those items... how wold you feel?  Bored?  Like you've done   everything   that there really is to do?  Or create a new list?  Hm... to early to answer that, eh?  I'll write my answer once I complete the rest of the 5,950 of them...teehee!  Carpe Diem!

      So I didn't get to see Kerry on Monday.  It was pouring and I wasn't planning on getting soaked.   Anywho, yesterday completely   sucked  .  And it kinda rolled over to today,too.  The whole situation with me and Serge has been gettin worse and worse.  I'd elaborate, but I'm not the kind to complain... I'll just keep it bottled up till the day comes, and then... KABLOOM!   ...

      So this weekend turned out to be a complete waste.  I've done nothing productive.  Hopefully Qianna won't ask me to babysit Jasmine for the whole weekend anymore... whew! She's a good kid, but it's such a hassle running around the house, checking up on what she's doing; making sure she isn't sticking her fingers in the outlet,or touching something sharp or whatnot...   *** Watching the 11 o'clock news right now.  Supposedly they're promising thunderstorms tomorrow... If only it be so.  I miss the lighting and thunder and pouring rain...  Reminds me of childhood back in MA.    John Kerry is stopping by tomorrow at the Pioneer Square.  So I'm guessing it'll be really busy downtown tomorrow.  I was thinking of stopping by after school and see what's going on... but apparently they're not allowing backpacks through the gates...  so, I don't know... Tomorrow we'll see....

      Serge is a freakin dumbass.  At times I just wish he could see things through my eyes!!   It’s like he doesn’t even have a clue that what he says and does is stupid, irrelevant, and most of all disrespectful and hurtful!  And at times when I try to explain to him in a CALM voice how his actions bother me… he just lashes out at me and things just are chaotic!  Lately, I haven’t even bothered pointing anything out to him because I just HATE it when he acts like a complete retard afterwards.  He’s manipulative.  He’s stubborn.  He touches his stupid hair too much… he could make it as a fag without even trying hard.  He’s way too freakin self-conscious!  Always asking me about his damn nose, his stupid vein that is somewhat visible where his under eye area is… always ALWAYS asking me about his HAIR!!!  And if I ask him how my hair looks like… he’s just like…hmm…yeah…good….  Don’t get me wrong… I’m not that soft.  It’s just that he doesn’t seem to get it…  He always expects the best for himself and he gets it!  But when people ask him for a favor… he strikes them with haughtiness and refuses or expects to be paid for it.  And he never seems to do things out of goodwill.   Now I’m not saying I completely HATE him… He’s a great brother when he’s not in his stupid mood swing phase.  We have fun at times.  Comparing him now to how he was like just 3 years ago… he’s changed for the better.  But there are still things that he can’t seem to get rid of.  And he’s also seemed to have developed this pride, this arrogant personality.  At times, I don’t even want to argue with him, even though I know I am 1000% right!  And even at those times… I can’t tell if he’s serious, or just being a plain dumbass!   Anyway… I just pray he will change.  Till then, I’ll just express my rage by cursing under my breath and through this blog. LoL.

      Seems like everyone’s goal in life is to strive to be a freakin’ millionaire.  Yes, sure, it would be quite nice to have a million bucks lying around, and being financially secure and what-not…  It just pisses me off, though; how some people are telling me “you should invest.  You should buy mutual bonds.  You shouldn’t be an employee; you should buy your own company and be the boss. Yada yada yada…”  You know what??  First  you  do that!   You  try buying and running your own damn company when you have never even worked in your life and have no experience in the real world.   Once  you become a fuckin millionaire,  then  will I only listen to your small-minded advice!!  Personally, I would feel a lot better about my self, of who I am, if I were to serve the community somehow and get paid for service.  I don’t even think I would need millions in my life.  I just can’t seem to see myself doing stocks or whatever…trying to be rich.  I wouldn’t be able to go through everyday having to check if I should sell or buy or fire or hire a new broker…. I think with all that stress, I’ll die too early and wouldn’t even have a chance to see my riches.  LoL.   Sadly to say, people are never happy with they have.  They always seem to desire for something better, something more superior.  So if they were to have that million, will they be happy with that??  My guess is no.  I mean, if you can’t be happy with what you have now… how can you expect to be satisfied with something more??  Wanting is an addiction. Now I’m not trying to say that doing stocks, investing, etc, is considered greed and its evil…ooo… no!  Not at all!  It’s just that I’ve been noticing that lately that’s the only thing on people’s minds!  They don’t seem to see and enjoy the simple pleasures of life.  Nothing has significance to them!  They’re like robots!  Work/School, sleep, eat, repeat, etc.  It feels like we’re losing culture.  We’re losing those special moments that appear before us, but we just don’t realize it cause we are too caught up in our oh-so busy lifestyle…  Pity.  Life has soooo much to offer than that...

      Well well well...I'm back. So Josh Groban was my last topic, eh?  So I guess I'll just start off there... I found out that Mr. Groban is coming to the NW again this summer.  Too bad I didn't get the tickets in time... I think they're probably sold out already... that's nothing new...  But I hope to still go down to the amphitheatre and get them the day of the concert... which is still some months away... I've got alot of things going on before then... The Bloody Lovelies are coming to Portland again!  And I'm fairly excited.  I hope I won't miss their concert this time.  Last time, I came right after they were done and packing their stuff... but I still got to hang around with the band and get their autographs.  Luckily Eric had his camera, so Serge took some pictures of me and the band and they sent them to me later on.  Nice group of guys.     I'm planning on inviting Irina to go with me.  For many reasons, really.  One, is she's never been to a concert...EVER! and I can sympathize.  Two, she's like the only one of my friends that actually would ENJOY the BL's music and not criticize any of it.  She's cool that way.  And, well... she always provides some sort of entertainment and you  can't   not  have a good time when she's around.  She's great.  I am also planning on surprising her with the Josh Groban Concert.  But...the thing is... I dont have the tickets yet... KEYWORD: YET!  Which means that I  WILL  get them!!! Promise to keep this updated.... Make it a good day!

      So I've been sick pretty much all week...  And I don't think I've had a good night sleep yet.  NyQuil doesn't seem to help.  I'm hoping that I'll feel better by tomorrow...I have to get to school.  These attendance points will screw up my grade...  Plus there's 2 tests tomorrow.  aaargh!!!!    I should start packing this weekend--14 days till my vacation!!! woohoo!

      Well I'm sick today, so I'm missing out on school... with these stupid attendance points... I might as well get a B in all my classes... bummer. *** So talking to Eric was really the highlight of my Saturday.  He's really a cool guy.  I still wonder how old he is... hmmm.....   I got the vibe from him that they are kinda sick of the Grobanites.  Well...not really   sick   of them... just that it's getting out of hand.  And when I told him that I found out about the BL's through the Josh Groban forum... he was like... "oh...josh groban..."  It seems like the only fans they are getting are grobanites.  I think, just once, they wanna hear someone say... "I read an article about you in the magazine and you guys rock!"  But instead they are getting like 50-60 year olds stalking them.  LoL. I don't think I really fit in with the Grobanites.  Yeah, I'm a HUGE fan of Josh and I adore him for his voice and maybe his beautiful looks and personality... but it's not like I travel to every concert venue he's at and do all the crazy things they do.  And like Eric said... Im not 60! LoL.   Anywho, I am kind of inspired (more) to learn the guitar... and I mean LEARN THE GUITAR.  Not just the chords, or the picking patterns, but EVERYTHING!!!  So I'm thinking of taking Guitar1 at PCC maybe in the fall term... I still have to check if they'll be offering it...   as for my happy list: 1)Seeing Randy and Eric again 2)Chatting with Eric 3)Playing ping-pong with Joel

      Right now I have like a million thoughts running in my head...  I don't even know how I feel!!!  (this is a sign of a moody blog...)  I have been waiting to see the BL's for about 2 MONTHS now!!!  I was freakin hyperventilating this morning!  And becuase of the stupid, dumbass Stepford's Wives movie... I missed it!!!  I am in complete outrage!!!  Yeah, it was great coming in there, and joke around how consistent I am...being late for their SECOND gig...  How much of a supporter am I?  And it was realllllly nice(for lack of better word use) for Eric to hang out with us over coffee and just chat.  That sorta compensated for missing out the show, but I really wanted to see them play and sing and actually go to a LIVE band concert!  (Other than Josh Groban's)  And I'm just completely dumbfounded by this whole experience today!  I actually felt uneasy talking with Eric, cause I felt like I was doing all the talking and everyone else was like... why does she keep talking?  can't she shut-up?  And I saw the look on their face when we were talking about Mass.  It was sorta like "alright...exclude us out...we don't know what she's talking about..."  I know I know... I sound like I'm putting myself down excessively... but how can I not feel this way, when lately, everything seems to never go my way.  And it's not like I want all the attention in the world and people serve me seedless grapes on a silver platter while I'm in my Egyptian Cotton lined bed!  You know what?  I don't even know WHAT to expect from people now.  Before, all Alisa has been talking about was Andrey Slezko and how she liked him and then hated him, etc...  Andre and Irina talk about their horrible house life.  And lately all Catherine is doing is sulking around and panickingly thinking of what to say to her hearthrob Tom the next time she's gonna see him.  Don't get me wrong.  I love my friends.  And I am more than happy to have them pour their hearts out to me; just the fact that they trust me enough to tell me their feelings, wow, what an honor!  But I guess I don't understand one thing... why can't I ever spill my feelings out to them.  Why don't I have enough... I dont know what... to say, "this is what's going on in my life, and this is how I feel about you, you, and you." ???  Or when I actually DO tell them my deepest darkest secrets... I guess this "oh...okay" reaction.  Anywho... maybe I'm just overexaggerating or maybe I'm just in a shitty mood after this whole concert situation... I felt Catherine and Alisa's not wanting to be there.  Catherine never even spoke!  That's one thing I don't get about her... she doesn't take compliments easily. She puts herself down too much.  Why???   Anyway, the Stepford's Wives was a total waste of VALUABLE time and money.  And I'm forever gonna hate it cause it will remind of what happened today.   What I guess I'm trying to say is... that I always do things that everyone else comes up with, like let's go to the park, or, lets watch Stepford's Wives!  And when I decide to announce 2 months ago to go watch the freakin Bloody Lovelies show, it doesn't happen cause once again, Olga has been too nice to speak out and say NO! This is ridiculous!   I'll compile my happy list tomorrow, for I don't want to ruin my angry mood that I've been building up.....................................................................................

      I feel like I haven't been trying hard enough in school... Either that, or I just don't feel challenged enough.  There are students around me that all they do is stress out over a   simple   vocabulary quiz.  My God!  How EASY could the prof. make this damn test?!   I freakin procrastinate like CRAZY!  I never take notes, just doodle.  I just briefly glance at my study sheet half an hour before the exam. I listen to lecture without even TRYING to understand what the hell she is talking about. I get A's.  So now I'm thinking...I procrastinate and get A's... So I guess procrastination isn't all that bad, eh??   Then there's the feeling that I don't even LEARN anything!!  I can retain it in memory for a week or so, but ask me what a neuromuscular junction is next term and I'll just stare at you blank faced.  I feel like I'm getting softened up too much here, when I should be developing thick skin for when I start attending OSU.  I know graduation is only 6 months away, but I've been thinking about it excessively.  I'm actually kinda scared of going out into the real world.  School has been sorta like a "bubble" for me.  I'm allowed to go in there and learn.  Once in a while I am allowed to come out and make a mistake.  But I can't imagine in the real world: making the tiniest error could kill someone.  And I feel like I'm not getting enough time to perfect my technique!   I don't think I have a happy list today...  Couldn't think of anything, yes, shame on me.  I finally watched Shrek 2 though!  That's something to be happy for, right?  Here is something irregular though: A guy tying his tie...How hot is that?????  LOL. I actually saw this one guy tie his tie on ths bus this morning... and for some odd reason, that just struck me as something very intriguing.  LoL... I'll elaborate more on that later...........................................

      Okay, this is gonna sound crazy:  I'm home alone today.  And from my window, I can see two strange lookin guys running up our driveway, up the stairs and loudy banging on the door and ringing the doorbell maniacally!  Normally, if I hear a doorbell or knocking, I just run up and open the door.  I don't know what, but something stopped me.  I was standing DEAD STILL in the hallway, hoping they wouldn't see from either windows...  I can say I've never felt that scared of being home alone.  Just when I think it is safe to go to the window and check if they're gone... I hear them running up again.  They ring the doorbell, pound, then leave.   ...Just a thought>We should get a peep-hole on our door...   Happy list: 1)Adam sleeping on the table... awww, how cute. 2)Fitz let me hold his glasses!!! LoL (inside joke) 3)I FINALLY met Gnome today on my bus stop...

      Feels kinda weird after not sleeping for 48 hours!  II just have this thing, where I sorta feel uneasy about having someone drive at night... I get paranoid that they might fall asleep behind the wheel, so I just sit in the front and keep them company.   It's soo uncomfortable trying to sleep in the car!  But then again... once you're past the "tired" stage... you can't fall asleep anyway... so yeah... I've got humongous bags under my eyes!   So the visiting those people in CA wasn't all that bad.  They're kinda... well... STALE!!!  I've only enjoyed the company of like 5 or 6 people(out of like 45 that were there).  Three of which were grownups and the others were lil kids.  There's this little boy... probably around 9 or 10, he's soo adorable!  We were saying our good-byes to each other for like half an hour! He said he loves me! Awww... Sucks I didn't take a picture, though!   *** I missed school today... yet again... We came back at 6:30am.  I was tired out of my freakin mind!!!  And I wasn't planning on going with blood shot eyes!  Geez I hate that!  I hope I won't get a damn B in English just cause I missed a few attendance points.   This whole attendance crap is STUPID!  Like in typing... I was typing OVER 55wpm!  I was doing 75wpm!!!  And I got a freakin B in that class because I missed 4 days of it!  Goodness!  So, what was the whole point of the class then?  To improve your typing?  or to just BE there?  It's ridiculous!   And then there's that whole lecture on if you're gonna be absent, notify the instructor...  Notify MY ASS!!!  What's the point of that anyway??  It's not like they're gonna "not count" it.  I used to do that.  I e-mailed my teacher and told her I had surgery, so I can't come in the next day... And??  I still got a B for missing that one stupid day!   Anywho... happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts........ 1)That little boy I met in CA (don't remember his name) 2)Serge said I'm smart (it's an honor getting a compliment from him) 3)Got 4 hours of sleep this morning in my oh-so comfortable bed! :-)  Well... off to work out!  Carpe Diem!

       I think I like Adam.&nbsp; He looks like a nerd... actually that sounds mean, but he's adorable in his own quirky way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I like his lil chipmunk smile...heeheehee!&nbsp; So cute!&nbsp;    Anyway... now that I got that off my chest...&nbsp; I've been feeling very artsy lately...which is a good thing, right?&nbsp; And I'm actually getting better at it.&nbsp; I drew 3 portraits in a week... and Sepadai wants me to draw her...I think she said she'll pay me... but I don't really care... I do it for the enjoyment purpose... Although I  do  need the money.&nbsp; I'm going to Six Flags San Francisco in August... so yeah...    &nbsp;  I find it so strange how the Ticketmaster system works.&nbsp; The week the tickets went on sale, all the front seats were sold out and the only thing available for months was the lawn seats.&nbsp; And now, the concert is only a month away, and the best seats are available!&nbsp; ...I'm feeling lucky lately...tooooo lucky.....hmmm.....

       This reminds me sorta of the movie Cabin Fever... But I'd like to call it Hotel Fever...&nbsp; Here we are, in one hotel room, and all of us are sick with sore throats.&nbsp; We first started blaming Serge, now we're all aware of each other.&nbsp; We're making sure we don't touch each other's towels, don't touch the ice, don't share any food or drinks in order to not catch each others' germs.&nbsp; It's hilarious, though!    Earlier today, all four of us walk into Walgreens to get medicine.&nbsp; We're all standing there, sounding SICK! with these deep, scratchy voices... trying to decide which meds are better...&nbsp; So funny!!

      I've just noticed how Oregon differs from Florida...other than the obvious...&nbsp; Here in FL, it's more superficial.&nbsp; Everyone's into shopping, tanning, beach...etc.&nbsp; I cherish Portland more though.&nbsp; It's laid-back, no-rush, artistic and full of music and culture.&nbsp; The people are more mellowed out and enjoy more than complain... if that makes any sense.&nbsp; I miss home.&nbsp; Yes, I'm having an incredible time on vacation, but it's only a vacation.&nbsp; You know it's gonna end soon and back to my daily routines.&nbsp;  People come here to FL (Serge, for one) and all of a sudden are saying the  love  it here and that they wanna  live  here.&nbsp; Things here are so expensive, yet they pay you crap!&nbsp; It's not all fun in the sun here, unless you're retired, of course, hehheh.&nbsp;  But most of all...Portland's tap water tastes (and smells) good! &nbsp;

       It seems like everyone grows up looking up to a role model... What the hell is a role model anyway?&nbsp; Is it someone so freakin' perfect in every way that makes you want to be just like them?&nbsp; Or is it someone who you like spending time with; someone who teaches you important life lessons; someone who touches your soul profoundly...?  Sad to say, I didn't grow up having this role model character!&nbsp; You ask kids who they wanna be like when they grow up.&nbsp; Mostly you'll hear "my mommy" or "my daddy".&nbsp; I love my parents but I can't say that I admire them.&nbsp; Sad.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I grew up learning morals and lessons my own way-through my own trial and error.&nbsp; Not that I am complaining-just that I'm kinda missing out on that "my mom always told me...", "my dad taught me..." &nbsp;I've never had any stories told to me that were passed down from generation to generation.&nbsp; No recipes, no heirlooms...&nbsp; I get everything I need.&nbsp; But is that love?&nbsp; I'm  positive  that my parents love me... but maybe in a "wrong" way...or maybe it's just me... I want them to ask me how school is going, check my grades, ask about friends, life... anything !!!Butt into my life!!!&nbsp;  I don't recall ever having a profound conversation with them!  Oddly enough, I'm proud of who I am; of who I've become and who I am growing to be.&nbsp; I'm a producy of my own equation.&nbsp; I've learned to take all the negativaty and reciprocate it into positive factors.&nbsp; I have my own visions.&nbsp; My own opinions, ethics, morals, standards, values...whatever you wanna call them.&nbsp; I've learned to develop tough skin and not take any shit from anyone.&nbsp; I don't give it damn what anyone thinks of me or of who I am.&nbsp; I believe that I am a great being.&nbsp; And I'm not meaning to toot my own horn here, but I have never done harm to anyone...(not intentionally)...at least I've never been confronted of it.&nbsp; I have no desire to do evil, or get pleasure to watch someone suffer.&nbsp; I love life.&nbsp; I love people.&nbsp; I love the little simple things.&nbsp; I just wish everyone did.&nbsp; That everyone would stop this hate and criticism, stop putting others down.&nbsp; To just take notice of others' feelings and consider that what they do is having an affect on others... ahh.... I guess I'll only daydream about this metaphoric utopia...la la la....

      As of late, I've been feeling like shit, parcticularly when it comes to the topic of my friends--Alisa, Catherine, and Irina.  Ever since I've come back from Florida,  everything  has been turned upside down and shaken up.  Nothing's the same.  I feel like a complete dufus in their presence, like I shouldn't even  be  there at all.  Maybe it's me who's changed, or at least my views.  Maybe I'm not conforming with them just like they are with each other... I don't know, but it is really getting to me.  I feel like I can't talk to anyone about  anything  anymore, unless it's about guys or some gossip or judgements.  It's sick!  I can't have those intellectual conversations anymore.... pity. I also feel like, well... I don't know how to describe it...  I think I've mentioned this in a previous entry--I wanted to see the BLs concert...never got to it.  Last weekend, I wanted to go see the Flugtag, Catherine and I got there, and then she tells me that she has to be home by noon...what the hell???  Didnt you know it was gonna start at 1??  And you were home for only like half an hour and the rest of the day you just hung out at the bookstore???  Then there was the time when Irina and I were gonna go downtown Friday, we planned it like a week,  then she never calls me or anything... so yeah, that gives me a right to feel shitty.  Why?  Because I feel like they're not being honest with me, I mean, if you don't want to go out and hang out with me, say so.  Don't give me pathetic reasons or try to sway away from doing it.... gah!!!!!!!!!!! Then all 3 of them have this whole new boyfriend issues, which they are reluctant to discussing with me... I still never understood why...am I really intimidating??  seriously... why the hell not?  If you are reading this... please, answer me... what makes me the only person, whom you consider a friend, who you  never  speak of these issues with??  All I get from you is a  "oh, I'll tell you later..." (never do, by the way) or a "oh, it's nothing"  or "Oh, alisa, I'll call you later tonight and tell you what HE said to me"  Fuck...go ahead...I don't really need to hear anything about your damn issues, just do me favor and don't mention them infront of me!!!  If that's the way it's gonna be, I won't be discussing anything that goes on in my life with you out of spite...  Actually... I don't think that would even bring the slightest interest,eh?  That's all.
