      So yesterday I smoked Shisha (a.k.a. hookah a.k.a. water pipe) for the first time. It was an unplanned event entirely. A bunch of us went out to see Fahrenheit 9/11 and then wanted to go to Zen Cha, but it was closed. So next best thing? The Shi Sha lounge on High St. I've never smoked anything before, but since I know its really watered down tobacco, I admit, I have always been a little curious about shisha. It was rose flavored to boot, and the pipe (someone said its also called a bong, but I thought a bong was the smaller kind of pipe, whatever) was really pretty, so I tried it. Donny kept laughing at me when the smoke made it mostly out of my nose and the rest came out my mouth. Apparently I didn't smoke properly. But I did smoke a lot. I was in between Scott and Oren, so each time they passed the pipe back, I got another hit. Smoking twice as much as either of the guys didn't make a difference though. There was no buzz, no sting, no coughing. I think I would definitely do it again given the right group of people and a good flavor. And no, its not my gateway to more nicotine. I hate cigarette and cigar smoke. Its too acrid. I wonder though if the Smoke Free Columbus deal applies to Shi Sha. Especially since its a really weak smoke. I guess I wouldn't miss it if it did. Glad I tried though.

      I'm cooking for the mudphud dinner tonight and it smells like turkey in here.   Aside from that, I'm studying the specific mechanisms involved in constipation and diarrhea (both types), and watching my cat sleep.   Its times like these when I think, damn it'd be nice to have something else to do, but til then, I better really enjoy this! Really really.   Ciao peeps.

      Check out the blogs of my friends. After all, they got me into this mess. :)   A man of rhyme and rhythm, and just the right words, my dear buddy from CWRU,  urlLink Shareef   Fellow OSU mudphud, favorite Iowan, traveling buddy, and partner in crime,  urlLink Aaron   Law student, shopping buddy, co-habitant of COJ coffeeshop, and professional cutie,  urlLink Chris   What's interesting is every one of these guys is politically inclined. I guess that makes up for my dearth of political commentary. Really, you'd think it would rub off on me by now, but so far all I have is a deep appreciation of Michael Moore's works and an interest in voter registration among minority communities (like mine!). Ah well, Enjoy!

      So this weekend I attended my first wedding of a close friend. Although Donny (my good buddy and wedding date) and I were too late to see her walk down the aisle, it was still totally surreal to see her up there, in that dress, taking vows, exchanging rings, and being dubbed a Mrs. for the first time. I think I was in a trance or something for those few minutes, and all I could think about was, "Are we sitting on the wrong side of the chapel? Oh SHIT. We ARE sitting on the wrong side of the chapel. Do I know anyone on this side? What was the groom's name again? What if the bride sees me on the wrong side? I think I just ruined her wedding. Oh DAMN." Donny and I made it out alive though. We even ran into an old friend of Donny's named Steve who also sat on the wrong side of the chapel (opposite us). I really liked Steve. Total cutie and really passionate about what he does with his life. Really outdoorsy kinda guy too. The reception was really long, but having Steve and Donny there made it go by much faster. Add to that the five high school friends I ran into. Apparently I was sitting next to one in the chapel and we didn't even recognize eachother (OH NO we're that OLD! and OH NO, she knew about our faux pas!). Other people I ran into were my high school orchestra stand partner and one of my best friends' sisters. It was driving me crazy how much PDA there was going on among this particular group of people. Lots of fiances and spouses, and they were all really reeally clingy. I don't like that at all. It shows a total absence of trust when a woman is hanging onto her SO's arm for dear life, or lips for that matter. In any case, dinner was excellent and dancing followed. Donny and I didn't get to waltz but we did get to swing, which was a ton of fun. An electric slide and Casper's mix later, and we were out with our complimentary jars of honey as wedding gifts "Sarah and Matthew Stuck Together June 2004."   Now all I need is my own honey to be stuck to. Yeah that's exactly what I thought at the wedding. Weddings have a funny way of making you want to hook up, even if you are living a perfectly happy independent life. I think I'll get over it...

      Ok, I'm cheating. This is a recycled email-turned-post from February. But I had saved it for just such an occasion because I think its one of the most random emails I have ever written. Ok, definitely not the most random, but its up there. One of these days I'll actually write something current and put it up. But til then...    Here is the article a friend sent me that was all about sex clubs. Read it and just TRY to tell me that it doesn’t sound like something you’d totally think about trying just once for fun (but also never actually do it cuz its one of those, gee sounds sexy, I'll think about it, but umm NO).   http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/fashion/11SWIN.html   And just because I was curious I looked up some caffeine stats. The MW of caffeine is 194 g/mol. There is on average 200 mg caffeine in a regular strength 8 oz cup o joe (100-120 mg in soda, 60 mg in tea). Thus, the average 8 oz cup o joe has about a 1 mM concentration of caffeine. Who knew?  And finally, someone asked me about migraines so I looked that up too. Migraine headaches are quintessentially caused by stress. Stress causes arteries that supply the brain to go into spasms, which leads to some platelet-clumping within those arteries and ultimately releases serotonin. Serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and causes other arteries to constrict, but this begins to limit blood supply to the brain. So what does the body do? Can’t shut the brain down… OoOOHHH noooo…the brain is very very important. So as a compensatory method, arteries begin to dilate all over the brain, from the initial source of the headache through the scalp and neck, and presumably supplies regions where pain receptors can be stimulated. And this, my friend, is what causes the pain of a migraine headache. ARE YOU EXPERIENCING STRESS?   http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/health-info/dis-cond/headache/migr-hea.html  Tata!

      Tuta Tara (“broken star” which is what they call a shooting star in Hindi)  Sometimes it seems the broken sky is gathering at my feet And in my haste to avoid the mess, clean up the mess, or destroy the mess I forget to look up again And see the holes left in that sky, twinkling down at me A gentle reminder that not everything has fallen Not everything is shattered And in the larger scene, even as the debris collects below, Punching those holes out of the dark was necessary  To create the greater beauty that remains

      Mudphud  (about being md phd and why we love it even though other people find it scary)  A mudphud is a special kind of animal who is always Seeking relief of that inner itch to know or do something new	 The myriad jewels of knowledge and experience  That can ever be grasped or fathomed  In all of mudphudland, In all the world. All of them glitter as hopeful possibility on the road towards perfection To these highly capable creatures who are Fully talented, grateful, and aware that To whom much is given, much is expected. To observant mudphud enthusiasts, and there are many, This species of soul has never been observed Actually performing its required task of self-directed studying But the mudphuds are a secretive sort Who could never understand why learning is so easy for them, only that it is And that they love it, and they don’t care what judgment others pass of their own individualized education. In the mudphuds natural habitat of the library, a coffeeshop, or highly personalized personal abode, One may observe a range of mudphud dialogue, from intellectual procrastination to uberproductive idea exchange to regressive but necessary childish antics Wary of what is revealed and what is concealed about themselves Presented with interesting situations or options, in any sphere of life, they have never been observed to say No I can’t or No I don’t want to And they are never lying when they do this. Because somewhere inside there is a little spark for everything in the mudphud, and  They naturally want to build a fire for every spark of potential that they have. Some are so fascinated by the multitude of sparks they don’t know which fire to kindle first Others kindle flames as they come, seek the warmth of the blaze, and then move to the next, leaving the first one behind, Yet others take a middle path. Mudphuds as a species will always question themselves But perhaps all they really need to learn is that setting limits, making difficult and honest choices, does not suggest incapability, but strength of character In the end, deep down, these animals trust mostly themselves, and by the magic of intuition, Know exactly what they are all about and what they need to do.

      Crazyhoney bee  Lone honeybee zips from Fragrant flower to flower Neglecting none, sampling each one Unable to recall the distinct Image or aroma of the first Flower she passed because Its own nectar mixes with the next into sweeter Confection as she travels to Novel and enticing Patches in the delicate wilderness  The hive beckons for her Contribution to the blend, and of this She can proffer much. Her collection is Great in variety, but only Because she takes the Tiniest samples of each Of many, many, blooms before She starts out again on the mad chase For sweetness…  Only occasionally looking back With her wide open eyes With her episodic mind And remembers everything with gratitude. She cannot recall the path she  Took to arrive there but only That the trip was sweet and pure Beautiful and intriguing Just like her when the sticky honey Abundant and burdensome,  Spills and adheres to her motorized wings  Forces her to stop her bumbling And breathe it all in for a moment  It may be flighty and unstructured to the keen observer,  But it is fulfilling, purposeful and Colorful, the life of a lone honeybee

      Ode to Sandy’s Round Tooshy Ass  The informative self-contained message at the visitors center Was played for you in all its sensational flaky glory Over the span of nine minutes it addressed all you needed With my boy Bob the Japanese guy to answer every major concern you could have had Especially regarding if you can touch me, feed me, or murder me in cold coral blood When you fear your own imminent death approaching Apparently you forgot all about me, after all I’ve done to bring beauty to the world Even after the catchy song and dance of oughts and better nots That you memorized and adored for all its inherent dorkiness And even sang as you thought about skipping down the street After all that, after all that You still wiped out my entire existence and that of my beloved family With your huge ass.  Extra golden brown and slightly firm as it was, It wasn’t worth the ultimate price, Sandy. And you let your thigh take out my cousins. I hope that hurt bitch.

      "So Farsi So Good Blogging boom gives Iranian women a voice: "Take one exasperated Iranian woman. Add a computer. Hook it up to the internet. 'And you have a voice in a country where it's very hard to be heard ...'" Nice! Maybe that should be in our tour. "   My sisters are hooked up! I always get excited when I hear about Muslim women taking steps in the right direction. Speaking up, getting out, etc. I remember what it was like in Bangladesh a loong loong time ago, and women couldn't even go to the mosque with the men. I remember I got sneered at when I went with my dad, and I was only six years old! And what amazes me more is that these repressive rules weren't part of Islam as it was originally. I'd be happy to share resources if anyone is interested. And I'm way generalizing here, but its pretty fascinating what a little bit of superstition, an overactive and undereducated rumor mill, and some institutionalized dogma can do to entire cultures. Speaking of education, I still think women's education will save the world. Mothers are the first teachers after all.

      Chasing after shadows In a parallel universe My mind wanders in  The happily controllable mystery I’ve made in the reaches Of my mind lies a distant village Where the beauty of the day Wakes the sentiments of hearts	 And relationships are honored and doors Are left unlocked in seeming love Yet deep in every mind of every villager Lies the urge to know, to discover Something true about the village Or the mind in which it rests, far behind The windows that open to the world Where practicality and semblance Of reason rule over the expression Of purity of thought precious gems Which are made inside the dark behind The curtains which we only Truly peek through now and then   I break my own heart fifty times a day Building up innocent Expectations and being crushed anyway I am not naïve, I’ve only chosen not to play your game. How disappointing that people Do not trust each other, love each other, or connect With one another anymore? What is it we are so afraid of that keeps us further frightened And why rely only on pride to bring us happiness When the world contains enough simple beauty to do that on its own I do not want to lose myself in the cold when only I feel warm.   Someone told me they heard their father tell them these three words Only one time during their life What shame is there in affection and passion That we distrust it entirely and have eradicated it from the public sphere The inner anger and frustration of sons around the world Seeking mother figures and open hearts and selfless acceptance Has contaminated daughters too  And now it almost seems the world is flushed with the bitterness We once implored ourselves to hide beneath our smiles In the name of honesty and vulnerability with our inner negativity Have we not made ourselves More vulnerable than we started In the interest of being ourselves Have we not stunted our own growth Man has never been a purely angelic creature Yet so often we strive to lower ourselves to that level Instead of living up to what we were made for   When you don’t care or care too much I use my own heart as a ruler And I psychically predict the future of All our relations By the congruency of our hearts, moment to moment, The enigma of whether we are worthy to pursue In the grand scheme of the world Or if I am again better off alone and hidden As I was before I chose you to bring me out And only after much disappointment, guilt, Chronic self-beratement I am seeing better  How ineffective heart matching is In this world of constant dynamics Because I really cannot, No matter how I try or wish to Change you or improve you or teach you, Unless you ask me Allow me to know you And do not be afraid.   Why do matters of the heart frighten some people? Is it a sign of weakness to them? I do not understand. How else does one realize the true reaches of one’s strength If not through testing their vulnerabilities And reinforcing what they built A weak shield results when never taken to The battlegrounds of life And this is the shield that remains In the secure realm of home, while others  Fight the necessary struggles   This moment  In which I Move This, here, Is the very life I  Live and must This new virgin Moment that has Arrived Decked in splendor Novel beauty Has already Erased The one in which I started This thought And everything That lies before It and now And onwards Onwards to virgin moments   You are an enigma to those who Hold on to our self-control And being of us, I feel your Pain, of losing sight of yourself It was in those efforts to please  Yourself, seek yourself Taken out of hand in your way Of always being Out of control, out of here, now here, now there Nowhere Gone too far, too wrong, too gone And then you were pleased, you found your Semblance of truth, so you thought But you knew It’s the world that the rest of us Choose not to visit Out of perfectly sound reason It’s the song of the sirens You think it is your truth But let me tell you what is true For those who seek escape to eternal bliss To plastic paradise Ephemeral imaginings Unrealized hopes and dreams shattered and discarded In favor of a realistic fictional realm So inward you go, diving and diving, Pursuing the elusive When so much has always been right there in your reach Could you still be you, still be there, deep inside, somewhere The you that we loved and we know, who smiled and cared Illness creates geodes out of perfectly beautiful people But what illness is it if you chose it of yourself So much is said of cures, healing, treatment When the real disease is still what it has always been Disease of the heart At this point, I cannot tell if you are A victim or a burden or a coward or pathetic Even accepting pain as part of life, Of believing in positive reframing, courage And the development of pearls Uncertainty is certain and the gray times of life Are what get me brooding   I never asked for much  Of what I’ve been given Rarely complained about my cheese being moved Except once or twice All my unworthy tears for minor frustration and Self-created problems Dried up the wells That are so inaccessible now When I feel like I should need them most   Ripple effect of tears and frustration Shattered dreams gathered and reglued Old pains and mistakes Brooded over like a cycling record Shame and guilt and pain Needing resolution, with roadblocks In ever foolproof plan Only a fool could block them anyhow The core issues, seen differently in the six sided  Prism reflecting everywhere And nowhere is there clarity of focus A direction in which we all can look and examine While the True Core is missed entirely, surrounding us, Within us, carrying us, What pain can result when Someone does not think thoroughly of the consequences Of their actions And how frightening, self reflection, self-identification For those who are still around   Today I cry inside my heart For all the heart I spent on you The times I played my part So many times I’ve been the hero Rising above my victimization So angry at your puppeteering Of lives bound by the sanctity of family You play us like the characters Of your personal show The rescuer, the evader, the hero, the neglected, the needy How self-centered and manipulative You steal away our true roles The identities we were meant to have And that I was only able to find By leaving you   Porcelain doll woken rudely From slumber to terror In the home where nothing bad happens Her pretty eyes widen in shock A channel of tears pours down her cheeks Carrying in them fear, love, anger, disappointment So much sadness Who sees the porcelain doll? So fragile and tender When the world has become rough And all has turned hardened Who dries the porcelain doll’s tears? Lost innocence is a shame When it is to a young and precious Porcelain doll, crumbling in fear Beauty hidden by confusion

      DTR and who am I of yours?  A lot of times I wonder how I present myself I only really know how I see me And never really how you see me But I do wish I could climb into your head At every moment that you are you And really find out when I am there And what fancies, colors, settings, and memories You have put me there with Because really, there is a bond Outside of us, but what is it inside?   It was amazing to see Everything I loved about The world The sunshine, stars, waves, Touristy people, attractive young men,  Sandy beaches, city life,  Culture, sunsets on the  Horizon, mountains, villages,  Childish song, and dance In a tiny speck of an Island in the greatest  Of the oceans All in four days with you. I can’t think of anyone else I could have created those particular Memories with Mahalo, my friend.   Freewrite on the beach  Five shades of blue Crystalline see through The odd sailboat The odd white foamy wave Total lack of hot men Except the gay one next to me I wonder why they call it diamondhead I love the natural distribution Of the palm trees As though they are not Artificial There to be seen but not there out of someones showmanship Beauty that doesn’t know it Fobiness extends everywhere and I don’t know hardly what to do with it I wish I could see a sea turtle Or lose this belly Ohmigod if I could lose this belly Battle of a lifetime I tell ya Maybe I could lose the flab and somehow use it to make the sun come out from behind the clouds again I love the slow rhythm of the waves hitting the beach   Sad day poem  There are times I feel I can’t keep up Or don’t belong It’s a world that I am not accustomed to that  Occasionally my companions are swept into And then I just want to go away And hide Or pretend it doesn’t matter if I’m there And I try to force myself to stick it out Be patient and dorky and dumb Fake energetic and happy Try to jump into the joke Because that is how I feel  And I know you don’t intend it But it is part of the dynamic And I love people too much To just leave them  But you know what I worry Sometimes that if I left Few would notice Or know me deeper than the surface It’s counterproductive and safe  To be social and antisocial at once And now it is written down

      These are all some short poems I wrote in November 2003. They're all untitled at present, but if you can think of a good title for any of them, or revisions or changes, let me know.   I heard you cough as  You said nothing was  Wrong The familiar cough Of a familiar problem The cough a dying  Man releases Hoping his spirit will Flow out with the  Blood and phlegm Did you hear me When I said I loved You and did you know I meant it    My heart fluttered for my friend And it was as though I never recognized you Did you say I had grown up? Did I look into your eyes As we smiled and laughed And wondered curiously? How did you interpret our time was it like me? You were one of many who had lost respect for me And perhaps it is because  I had lost an ounce of respect for myself, For not living up to the standards that so many respected me for.   You dared me to break wide Open Even though I felt too scared I have worked so hard to Build layers of protection Around my fragile heart And your strength of  Spirit shattered those  Walls I am glad that you did Because I was not about To do it myself I am relieved     So your kid sister has grown up Or your confidant has changed I am sorry I inspired you So much that I let you down I knew all along deep down That “me” was too good to be true,  Too good to last for you For everyone who thought it And especially for me But I like who I am now I’m glad to be stronger A little wiser, a little more trouble I just adore challenging people Perhaps I always will And despite how I have changed I still love being around you, knowing you,  Sharing with you, laughing with you You must know how much I admire you The way you treat everyone you know With such friendliness and respect If I could only get past my fear of your judgment I could let you know me as I really am Sorry my friend… and thank you.   Whimsical determination Her iron will shines through her worry She doesn’t know how her Laughter revives us Those of us who live by her Smile and loving heart For such a tough shell There is a deeply tender Adventurous, imaginative spirit in there That doesn’t know her own strength  And possibilities Don’t you ever cry When your laughter is like a  Heartsong for us   We are only intimidating Because we dare to break the rules for ourselves And challenge who you think you are And what you think is possible    Vibrance radiating from The toughest shell It is like iridescence How beautiful, colorful, The shine dancing through the air The brilliance eludes many From seeing too far inside the ornament Which you can only do if you step close enough To the star that you no longer see the rays alone But the fiery source that produced them Admit your vulnerability Because that is what makes you perfect. 	  Sometimes it seems the broken sky is gathering at my feet And in my haste to avoid the mess, clean up the mess, or destroy the mess I forget to look up again And see the holes left in that sky, twinkling down at me A gentle reminder that not everything has fallen Not everything is shattered And in the larger scene, even as the debris collects below, Punching those holes out of the dark was necessary  To create the greater beauty that remains

      As of September 2003   OK, this time I've really done it. I had totally forgotten about the little web "home" that Becky had so generously acquainted me with so long ago. She told me in 1996 that someday, when we're all reclusive people whose primary identities are found on the internet, it will be really nice to have some space to myself, like my own webpage. Well Duck you were right!  It looks like I haven't written since Junior year of college... um, thats a while, so I'll try to fill in main events right now.  The end of junior year came and went really fast. Through Spring, Summer, and Fall 2002, I was primarily devoted to my research in the Pehek lab when I wasn't in class. I managed to get 3 studies out of that lab: the SPUR study on D1 receptor specificity that took me to the Society for Neuroscience Conference in November 2002 (almost IMMEDIATELY after I was declared out of the severe stage of mononucleosis--see below-- I was on a plane to Florida! let's just say, never go to CityWalk unless you remember your ID! The only places we were able to go in were MoTown, MargaritaVille, and someplace else I can't remember. Although, dancing with the students from Alaska and Birmingham in the middle of the street for 2 hours was totally fun! So was getting reimbursed for the trip later!!), and then the Risperidone study took both Omar AND me to Colorado Springs (Can anyone ever forget the superposh BROOOOOOADMOOR Hotel? OOHHH GOOOOOOOD. or running into the other two indian/arab students from vancouver that were there and goin out with them for nearly the whole night (on Omar's heavenly bed, wasnt it)? or meeting the guy that invented Clozapine in person? perhaps driving "into the hills" during every spare moment, and watching EVERY STAR IN THE SKY SHINING above us from the pitch black heights of the Rockies! and then freaking out because the pot dealers brought their pickup to teh same ledge we parked our rental Camry! And finally, did I drive 10,000 ft into the sky? Up the tallest mountain in the continental US? in a RENTAL CAR? AWWWWWWwwww YEEEEAAAA baby!), and finally, I got to work on a really fast project to try to look at prolactin regulation of dopamine (American Cancer Society summer grant... that was the time Dan came by and nearly puked when he saw the rat guillotine). And all that fun was just from working in the lab! Let this be a lesson to those of you who think research is boring and for, dare I say it, NERDS.   but I still managed to have a life ON campus too. I TA'd BIOL 210 and 211, for Missy, who was once my own TA back in the day! Teaching is SO in my genes. My grandfather was a teacher, my dad is a professor, my uncles are professors, my other grandfather was a spiritual advisor. Its in my blood to teach people. I knew that academia was totally for me because of my TAing... and of course, I also got to meet all the cute little froshes and sophs. Admittedly, I had my favorites, and its been so cool to watch them "grow up" and start doing research of their own, get their own fellowships, etc. I miss em!  I also continued to work, at least peripherally, with ICDG and MSA (probably not as well-organized as I was initially), and RA both Glaser and Kusch (top of the hill buildings). I wasnt very good at either of these huge projects during senior year for several reasons. First of all, I got mono at the end of September, JUST after I submitted my AMCAS. So, I sat in bed, thinking I was dying, waiting for my spleen to rupture as I tried to breathe, propped up on 4 pillows for 2 whole weeks so that my throat wouldnt close on itself (it was SO swollen!), and surviving solely on ginger ale and Caprisun liquid calories. I dont think theres a single episode of The Wedding Story, Trading Spaces, or The Baby Story that I ever missed. For someone who never watched TV, I watched more than I needed to make up for it during those 4 weeks in bed, and the following 2 weeks "adjusting to light activities." So, in the meantime, my secondaries piled up skyhigh, and I scrambled to finish my coursework so I could still graduate on time (did you know mono counts as a student disability?). I actually took the midterm and final for my Pharm 430 class within ONE week of eachother!!  Second reason I was underinvolved Senior year was cuz of med apps. I applied to several schools, from what I remember, they were OSU, CWRU, Wright State, Northwestern, Vanderbilt, U Illinois, Boston U, NYU, U Michigan, Duke, and Wash U if I remember correctly. Aside from the "only in-state applicant schools" like MIch, Boston, and NYU, I got interviews at every school. I actually ATTENDED interviews at OSU, CWRU, WSU, UIll, and Wash U. I know I know, why would I cancel an interview at Northwestern or Vandy? Believe me I got slapped across the face by many a compatriot premed for being such a snot. But honestly, it was because I knew I wasnt going to make it into their MD PhD programs (I missed the deadlines for that application at those schools) and I had already been accepted to MSP at UIll and OSU and waitlisted at CWRU. Wash U was really tempting until I actually went to St. Louis. I didnt like it. And yeah, I lived in Cleveland for 4 years.. St Louis should be a step up eh? Whatever... Ultimately, I picked OSU.  It was good for me for a lot of reasons. I knew that an 8 year investment of time would require a lot of family support, and also perhaps more of my own support of THEM. So I wanted to stick close. As Westernized as I think I am sometimes, whether thats actually true or not, I still have the ingrained belief that its my job to take care of my elders in their old age. Its the least I owe them for all I've put them through... I mean seriously, I would have a really tough time trying to raise a kid like me! I'm always so damn complicated! Also of course, I liked the OSU program better than UIllinois. Funding and resource wise, social life and urban access wise, OSU had the goods and U Ill didnt (as much). The third and final reason I was underinvolved on campus was cuz I spent so much of my spare time either in the lab (I'm talkin weekends and evenins here!) or with the former BF Dan (yes, former... we'll get to that). When we spent time together during the SUmmer of 2002 living in Clarke tower, we had a great time. I could totally be myself, immature goofball that I am a lot of times when I let loose. He taught me how to swing dance, and I gotta admit, when a man knows how to treat a lady as a lady, and dance with her as a lady... dude thats impressive. We did the whole moonlight stroll thing, sharing our personal poetry with eachother, discussing our views of the world, etc. Then I asked him out (I'm always making the damn first move... can someone ask ME this time around?) and the rest is history. Coping through my illness, his LSATS, both of our application processes and interviews, my cousins illness and death, and pre-graduation craziness... in some ways, the point of the relationship got lost for me amidst the fun. I mean, who doesnt like having ready company thats always comfortable, easy to understand, and available for hugs? I'm a sucker for a hugger. OK, that sounds so weird, but if you can stop laughin at the statement, you know what I mean.  ANYWAY, it was only when we spent several weeks apart during summer that I realized that our relationship was built on some flimsy idealisms, my own stubborness to make everything work no matter what, and the CWRU environment (which indeed is a bubble, and anyone who has ventured out of CWRU knows this... its not a bad bubble.. its a bubble you miss.. but its not a bubble you can take with you when you leave). We broke up in August just before classes started here at OSU. We're on hiatus but trying to be friends, but I think we'll manage.  SO yeah, in May I graduated. In June I started the MD PhD program here at OSU, also called the IMSP. I'm doing my PhD in integrated biomedical sciences, which essentially means I have access to rotate through and/or do dissertation work in any lab at OSU that studies something relevant to human disease. Its a different program than traditional MD PhD programs because it involves taking some grad classes and some med classes simultaneously at all times, but in the end, you get the dual degree and usually even shave a year off the time. For the CWRUers, its something like the BSTP and MSTP program all mixed together.  So far things are going well. Its definitely taking some adjustment, a new place, a new bunch of people, a bunch of people from my past that I suddenly run into (and had lost touch with.. so where do we pick up now?), and new responsibilities. I have never been a drinker, but suddenly I'm in this place where everyone drinks when they go out, so believe it or not, I'm finally learning to be a DD (i.e. I have been). I discussed this with Saad the other day. No matter how bad things got at CWRU, alcohol-wise... it was nothing compared to down here. AND, nobody ever really drove much (beyond across campus... a whole 2 miles), IF EVER. So this whole analysis of drinking and driving is totally new to me. Does that make me naive, innocent, or clueless? Anyway, its one of those new things, I'll learn, and I'm fine with it as far as my end is concerned. I'd never make someone stop drinking if thats what thy really want to do, just like I'd expect them to never push me TO do it, because I really dont want to (i have my reasons...). If theres anything CWRU taught me, its to be tolerant, and be yourself.  I do love bootyshakin on teh dance floor, and people watching, and meeting people, and of course sarcasm and "those random connections" (all the way back to Peter's connections journal) gets the best of me ALL the time, so I've still managed to have a good time between study sessions (and even sometimes AT study sessions!) I gotta admit its hard here. As a mud phud, I dont quite fit into the MD1 class, or the IBGP PhD class, because my course requirements and schedule always differ slightly. Its easy to feel disconnected from both. Then of course, I'm THE female rep in our 4-person mudphud class. I can't reeeally complain because its such a small program and I assume the fellowships are more smarts-related than gender-related. There are two other women mudphuds this year but I've only met one. Natosha is great though, just further ahead in her career and in her life. We connect as women and friends, but its different than chillin with my fellow 20-something ladies. I mean, I've actually always gotten along better with guys, and when I count my closest pals, I'd say a good 70% are guys. But still, amidst all of this disjointed social life and scrambled academic schedule, I need some sisterhood ya know? What happened to my always reliable always fun always social activist dance-lovin posse of Soumzy, Samara, Hadele, Maheen, Yasi and Ro? Cooking together and bellydancing and playing powderpuff sistas "Fooooball" trying on outfits and guy-bashing and analyzing Trading Spaces and planning community service projects? I'm still in touch with everyone from CWRU, thankfully, and of course, I'm making my best efforts socially down here. Never really been afraid to go up to someone and start a conversation. Even if you're only 30% successful at keeping in touch with the person, its a better chance of finding cool peopel than if you say nothing at all. So yeah, I've met a ton of people, and theres definitely people I could go up to and make small talk, or joke around, or study with, or invite out for the weekend, and a handful I could even "talk" to about the things that I really* think about. But overall, this early in the game, I think I agree with Nupe when he said, "its like you end up making these really good friends, people who are always ready to hang out with, people you have fun with, have tons of inside jokes and history with, but when it comes down to it... how many could you tell your life story to? or talk to about the bad things, the sad things, the things that worry you?" I guess overall what I've been feeling lately is something between the thrill and contentment of being independent combined with the boredom and frustration of being alone. Its the pain and excitement of the lone adventurer starting on a hopeful journey..... I guess its time to call it a night. As usual, my best writing/venting is at 3 AM. Still hopeful though, and working hard to be the best damn Mud Phud Chick there is.  "I wonder what wonder the world will bring me today?"

      again, i havent updated anyone on things, so here we go.  1) i've moved to columbus. got pretty new furniture and set up the place so that all my friends can come visit. hint hint! 2) bought a used car. 98 camry. compared to dans screeching hyundai, this is by far better.. not just better, to me, it feels like a brand new car from teh dealership. i LOVE it. its so cool to say, hey i bought that myself. never did that before. 3)finally found a jean skirt! hehe. i know thats not that exciting to many of you, but realy, i have been trying to find a slitless denim skirt for SO long, and i found one finally! and it was for only ten bucks at lazarus! and its not like a bad quality skirt either, i just hit it lucky that day. yay! 4) have been at home off and on the past few weeks. my cousins are visiting since their father is currently seeking work. one is 8 months old, the other is 8 years old. the 8 yr old is a little, shall we say, rambunctious. shes got energy out the wahoo and i worry sometimes that shes ADD. she cant focus on anything for longer than 5 minutes. then she says shes bored. even when she begged me for days to take her to see finding nemo, and i finally did.. she complained the whole time we were in the theater! anyway, i've helped her learn to read a little by enroling her in our community summer reading club, and hopefully that should help her find some focus. she actually likes reading now, so it made me feel good to do that. as for her baby brother.. he's the cutest baby in the entire world! he's ALWAYS laughing and playing. its soo cute. and he said Maa (mother) the other day when he wanted his mom. learning to talk too! i think he'll be walking by end of summer because he's getting good at pulling himself up to a stand. aww... i miss him now. :'( 5) going to NYC tomorrow to see dan and his parents. super pumped. i love their family and the city too. i think this should be an awesome trip. my mom wasnt too ecstatic about it, and like with every other trip i ever go on, she tried to convince me not to get on that plane. also, shes uncomfortable that i am visiting dan. i tried to reassure her that his parents are there too but i think all her denial that i'm actually really dating him, and really serious about loving him, is finally sinking in. its a shock to her, but i have to stand my ground. any tips on how to stand my ground but still help her feel a little better? 6) i start school in two weeks. less than that actualy. orientatino is the 20th and classes for the PhD start the 23rd. i will be working in a cancer immunologists lab for my first rotation. again, i'm excited. august is the actual beginning of medical school for th rest of the MD students(only md phds start in summer.. so we get a head start befoe everyone else). i need to send them my measurements to figure out what size short white coat i will be wearing. i still cant believe theyre actually gonna let me wear one! ;P  well, thats all for now. take care everyone. HAVE A LOVELY DAY! :)

      Well let's see here. Current updates: I decided to go to OSU for MD PhD. Dan also decided to go to OSU after all, which is so exciting because we get to kind of embark on the adventure together, which is actually very nice to think about. WHats better than starting something new, different, and BIG, with the person closest to you, right? I am looking forward to suporting eachother through our professional educations. SOOO< right now I'm trying to find a used car and a nice reasonably priced apartment near to campus. IN addition, I am trying to decide if I shoudl get my currently 4-yr old computer fixed, or just get a new desktop and shift my old components over to the new one. I'm thinking the latter choice, but its sortve expensive. OTher stuff? WEll, I have basically been hiding out in the lab for the pastmonth or two because my thesis defense is coming up soon and I needed to complete my final experiments, data analyses, and stats. THen I had to write the whole darn 40 pg paper itself, and next Tuesday I get to defend it. Before that can happen of course, I will be getting my wisdom teeth out (AAK! tomorrow morning!) Wow. thigns are moving so fast suddenly. I've got my cap and gown, my senior week tickets, and everything, and I'm even packing some thigns to send home to my house tonight with my dad, who is visiting. I am hoping that my daddy and my Dan Ye can spend some time together and get to know eachother better, since they havent had many opportunities. Hopefully when I am at OSU he will be able to get to know my family better. ANYWAY, back to work. but its nice to do some LJ for a bit. LATA!

      i don't have a clue what the last thing i wrote ab0out on here was, but i thought i'd add a tidbit to update those of you who may be reading (and i probably see you all the time anyway, whoever you crazy fans may be out there...).  i interviewed at OSU for their MD and MSTP programs (MSTP is MD PHD combined program) the monday after the huge-ass game against Miami. Believe me, in addition to being an Ohio native, having half my high school class at OSU, and having people from my high school on the ol' BUckeyes team... I still had alterior motives for cheering for the Bucks (ohmigod, what if my interviewer was a big fan and gets pissed off if the bucks lose??). Anyway, it was a bizzare scare, but it prompted me to watch the entire game and i loved every minute of it. FOr those of you who saw it, you definitely know why. A nail-biter to the very finish!  Other interviews I've got lined up are Wash U, WRight State, Vanderbilt, and CWRU. I don't have a first choice really. Pretty much whoever will pay me the most to go to their school (weighed by their academic reputation also and whether or not I get into MD/PhD somewhere).   IN the meantime, being healthy again is so nice that I have been spending all my time planning and dreaming and organizing all the "cool fun stuff" that i missed last semester. Hey, theres always time for make-up fun! I want to travel this summer, and read a lot of books that I have been putting off, do a lot of research, volunteer, etc. Theres a ton of things that I have missed doing and right now it feels like the pull is every direction.  BUt luckily, Dan keeps me (relatively) sane with all these futuristic goals and helps me enjoy these moments that we have as seniors. Its also exciting that a lot of my pals from last year that were gone fall semester have returned, so lots to share and catch up on yet.   Well, thats all for now I guess, have a lot of reading to do and work first thing in the morning (I guess morning is going to creep up soon enough since its already 5:30 am! yikes!)

      So as long as I was here, thought I'd throw in an update. Healthwise, I'm feeling better, much better than before anyway, but inside I'm freaking out about medical school applications and catching up with classes. I'm trying to be patient with myself and just take things day by day, but it would definitely be nice if I relaxed a little more. Just need to chill! I've missed a lot of class since I've been sick, and being the overachiever I will embarrassingly admit to being, it's hard for me to just give in and say, "Hey, i need more time" or "I need to be excused from this" when I'm so sick of being sick!  Luckily, my throat pain has subsided, fever is long gone, I'm fully decongested again, and my appetite has returned (somewhat). All I have left of mono now is a nagging need for a nap about three times a day and an inability to walk more than 400 yds without breaking a sweat. This is, of course, a significant debilitator to my everyday activities, so it's something to which I'm still getting accustomed.  On the bright side, I have learned so much from these events. Our health is so precious, and so basic to our ability to function at our best. There is definitely a reason that basic human needs: food, water, shelter, security, and health, are at the bottom of Maslow's hierarchy and self-actualization is at the top.  Mono is just a minor illness--inconvenient yes, but still minor--on the grand spectrum of pathology, and it has managed to teach me this. As a result, I am further impressed by the strength and resilience exhibited by people who deal with more severe chronic illness. At times, by comparison, I feel like a wuss for being such a whiney, cranky, sleepy, sick person whenever I shuffled from my bed to one of three places--1) the computer, 2)the RA microfridge, or 3) the bathroom--and back again a couple of times a day. :) Don't worry, this wuss is going to tough it out! I'll still be nice to my body though.  So.. I was incapacitated for a while, but I'm getting back on my feet, and now the mountains of work that I ignored all this time are screaming for attention. Pray for me. I need strength!

      Today i tested positive for mono. As well as strange liver enzyme action, which apparently comes along with mono. And although yesterday nothing hurt where it was supposed to, today, everything hurt where it was supposed to. Dammit! The doctor sent me home with more information, instructions for rest and fluids, and a few bags of medications.. no joke.. I have these cute little bags of it.. WOW. Its a lot of ibuprofen, cepacol, and codeine. Wow.. codeine?? i'm a little nervous about taking that. But then again, the pain at night is really sucky... hmm.. I'll consider it. Anyway, so I have mono. i'm glad to know what I have, but i'm a little pissed off that I wont be getting better soon. It also feels weird to talk to people about it. There seems to be that stigma that I must have kissed some big bad virus...and EVERYone wants to know if Dan "has it yet." I honestly don't have a clue where I got mono. It could be through a number of close friends or relatives who I share food with or spend time around (a sneeze, a cough, anything can have it if theres body fluids in it), or even through the dental school, which is one of my guesses, but unlikely...my cousin Sajid is the only person in the past few months that I have heard of with mono. My family went to go see him a little before he came down with it, but I didn't go with them. Of course, then I saw my family afterwards, so thats the best possibility. I still can't believe i actually have mono. I guess its better now than later. I'm worried about my classes and medschool applications. So much to do and so little energy! I am having trouble getting to know this new "sick self." I'm not used to not bustling about going places, talking to people all over... It exhausts me to walk down a single flight of stairs now! What happened?? Dan brought over some popsicles the other day. They are fabulous. Its the only thing that numbs my throat enough to sleep. Also, I've been watching more TV lately than I have in the past 5 years altogether. I feel like such a bum! by the way, theres this great flashy gay guy with an interior decorating/cooking show. The Chris Lowell Show I think. he's kinda fun to watch. Ok, I don't feel like a bum. I feel like a homebody.. sitting at home..all day long... on her bum.

      PSCL 315 Extra Credit: The estranged prom queen experiment  On March 19, 2002, the social norm I violated was casual dress code in everyday environments. I decided to wear a big poofy blue prom dress to several places around University Circle, social psych class, down the street, VA medical center, on an RTA, Thwing center, and the Baha'I club cultural dinner--for the duration of an afternoon. I chose this because although I would violate a norm, I felt like dress code is a social norm that would be something that could be "positively" violated, that is, no one would get angry or get in trouble for this prank, and I felt that was important since it was just an experiment. To plan this, the day before the experiment, I spoke with my VA lab director to make sure she was aware that I was fully sane and doing this for class and not to lose my job (the idea of working with lab rats in a prom dress struck her as very funny, admittedly, but she said Ok and that she couldn't wait to see it.). So, I came back to my room during my lunch break and took my dress to my first class in a bag, since I didn't have time to change, and changed in between that class and my social psych class. When I took the dress out of the bag in the Baker 1st floor restroom (my dressing area), I realized that I had forgotten to grab my nice shoes and a matching "hijab" (the scarf I wear on my head). I was getting a little nervous about that, and even contemplated waiting until the next day to do this experiment. However, I pushed myself against my own doubts to not only don the dress, but accompany it with the hiking boots, white ankle socks, and maroon hijab that I already had on me. Regardless of how beautiful the dress was, I was less concerned with looking out of place than with looking just plain tacky with the clunky boots and mismatched headgear. I ran into Jessica in the bathroom and she guessed that I was doing this for my project, but I told her not to tell anyone, and she didn?t. In addition to looking funny, I arrived late to class, my dress making a "swish swish" sound with every step, whereupon I heard lots of laughter as I tried to find a seat as quickly yet nonchalantly as possible. When Natalie asked for examples of projects, I raised my hand and mentioned another incident that I had done previous to this class (passing out smiley stickers to ER patients). At that point, I felt like everyone was watching me: "So, if you did that ER thing for your extra credit? what's with the ball gown??" At least, that was the effect I was hoping to achieve. I wanted to control for the bias of our psych class. After a while, no one seemed to notice my fashion faux pas, but on my way out of the building, I caught one male student giving me a really weird look as I dragged the tail end of my dress (its easy to clean off luckily) up the stairs. I went to KSL after that to check my email, and made it a point to walk around the 1st floor a lot.. to use the bathroom, to visit a friend, to check my email, etc. I ran into three friends, who all asked me why I was so dressed up. I said I just felt like it. They said I looked "really nice" and laughed when I revealed my hiking boots. One of them, the only guy of the three friends, didn?t say a word to me when he typically is very talkative with me, so I found that interesting. By this point, I was having fun and forgot the inconveniences of wearing a prom dress, so I swished around the 1st floor some more, wrote a couple of email, and headed out to work again. As I walked to the VA medical center where I do research, I saw a Greenie coming and I was near a stop. I raised my hand and started to move to the stop, and the Greenie passed me by. However, that could have just been a really picky Greenie driver too, since I wasn't yet exactly* at the greenie stop. When I got to the hospital, I entered through the main hospital entrance instead of the research building entrance I normally go through, and walked nonchalantly through the waiting room. Heads definitely turned. I saw them. I bought a chai from the coffeestand, and as I waited in line, a male nurse (perhaps in his late 30's )approached me and asked me if I knew "some girl who looked just like" me and had a bookbag like me who worked in research. Some research study that had to do with dogs?? I said, no I didn't. He then asked me what I did and where, I told him research and gave him a very vague response as to where (it was a little scary) "I work in research.. in the research building." He suddenly got really animated and said "It's YOU!" So I corrected him and told him a little bit about my research. He tried to ask me some questions about ant brains and whether or not I found them fascinating too? I think he was just trying to make conversation. I know nothing about ant brains, so I had to shrug him off in order to get to work. I was able to do my lab work without any problem, and afterward, I went back to the waiting room and sat very conspicuously right next to the TV, so that anyone watching TV (which was everyone), would have no choice but to see me. I sat there for 20 minutes, looking around the room, even examining the sign that pointed to the Mental Health ward (I thought it would be a nice touch). I caught about 3 "one-time only starers" and 5 "repeat starers" out of the 20 people in the room. One man approached me and told me I have a lovely complexion. (What the???). After 20 minutes, I got up and walked out to wait for the bus. I got on the RTA, using my handy dandy RTA pass, accompanied by two men with prosthetic legs. There were only two passengers on the bus already, and they didn?t seem to be fully alert to what was happening, so I had an uneventful ride over to Euclid. From there I went to Thwing center, where I spoke with a couple of my friends who were highly impressed by my dress and made me spin around princess-style for them in the Thwing atrium. It was Elyse and Jackie from social psych, no less.  They also wanted to know if it was a special day and why I dressed up so nice. I said that I just felt like it, and they gave me an understanding, "oh?" I could see that they weren't exactly satisfied with my answer, but they made it sound like they understood anyway. It was the social norm of politeness, I felt. At this point, I went to the Baha'I club dinner a half hour early. I am not an active member of the club though I am on the mailing list and know the president really well. I walked in, and though I didn't know anyone but Aaron, asked if they needed any help setting up. They were a little surprised at first, but then welcomed the assistance. Swishing around the Thwing ballroom in my ballgown and hiking boots, I set up the tea and coffee table and the programs. Aaron and some of his friends were standing with me at one point when a middle aged man who had come to attend the dinner introduced himself. Speaking only to Aaron, he said, in total seriousness, "I'm guessing you guys are all from Baha'I club right? And it looks like she [referring to me] just kind of wandered in?" Perhaps he was kidding, but he really seemed to disapprove of my presence at their cultural dinner for "good people," since I looked out of place. Aaron flashed me a "Yo Sanjida, disregard what he said" look. I wasn't offended but I didn't respond to him either. In fact, after the rest of the day's glares and politeness, I was surprised that the man had made a comment directly about my belongingness at this particular event. During the dinner, I received several comments that I looked nice and they loved my dress. I noted one friend who had a nice sweater and nice pants on, even say that she felt "really underdressed" for the occasion... although the occasion was clearly semi-casual to casual, and not a formal affair by any means. At Thwing I ended up telling my friend Hadele, about this experiment. I really felt like telling someone about my day's experiences. She promised not to tell until the dinner was over, but was the first to admit to me that yes, my outfit was tacky and that she was shocked I didn't match my hijab to my outfit as I usually do. I realized something at that point. Throughout the day, I really had to know that SOMEONE nearby, be it Jessica in class, my lab director at the VA, or Hadele at the dinner, knew that I was still a "normal" person, that I was not crazy and that this was "just for a class." It reflected my own insecurity about being different from others. That was probably the most interesting thing I learned from doing this, because at first I didn't even realize I was following this pattern everywhere I went in my dress. I walked home with Yasamin and Amit. After I debriefed them post-dinner, Yasamin said that "several" people had approached her during the dinner and said "Sanjida looks really nice today." I suppose that some people may have decided that since I had "tried" so hard to "look nice," the fact that I didn't match didn't matter (E for effort?), and overall, to them, I did "look good." However, another possible explanation is simply the social norm of polity. It is "common knowledge" that one should not criticize someone to their face because it might hurt their feelings. That is, keep the negative opinions to yourself, and express the positive. It is probably a good thing that we do this, survival wise. I don't think everyone would want to know what I totally honestly think of them at some time or another, and I don't think I would want to know what they totally honestly think of me at some time or another. So, it makes me wonder how often we are truly sincere in what we say to others. Had I not told anyone ahead of time about my project incentive, I probably still would do this activity, but only if I could debrief everyone afterwards. It is important to me that people see me as a rational person. My concern about my impressions on others, especially those friends and people who know me well, overshadowed my desire to be unique to the extreme. Also, my self-consciousness probably colored my attributions to others' behavior or intentions in what they said to me all day long. I don't see any way to avoid that false judgment when breaking the norm. I would definitely dress up again just for fun on a school day, but probably not to the point of breaking out a prom dress. If I ever DO break out the prom dress again, at the very least, my hijab and shoes have GOT to match. There just ain't another way to do it.

      As of February 10, 2002:  so a lot has been on my mind, and where else but my e-diary to vent it all. just call me the mistress of self-disclosure...  i love poetry, and i miss it because i have been too busy to actually write it all down, but at various points throughout my week i'll note a cool idea or concept that is poem-worthy.. and very rarely do i take the time to follow up on that. i tried though the other day, and got some poems started, but none finished. soon hopefully  busy. yes i'm a busybody, a busybee. i dont know what life would be like if i weren't busy. many people have asked me if i've ever been bored, and i can't say i honestly have. i have too much fun wherever i am and whoever i'm with. as frank vizarre said, there are no strangers... only friends we have not met. and on the rare precious occasion of solitude, i find moments of peace, rest, meditation, poetry, art, or music, to occupy my time. i have also been known to dance wildly around my room when no one is looking. ;) hey, ya gotta practice moves somewhere*. i have been studying for my social psych test (tomorrow) lately and the concepts in this field are really intriguing to an introspective soul such as myself.   elyse and i debated whether i'm individualistic or collectivistic. a 1st generation bengali, i think there are elements of both in me. we discussed the possibility that organized religion may be a cohesive force in some ways that seeks to collect people, but on the other hand, allow independent thinking (within reasonable means). i think the most interesting concepts to me are the ideas of false attribution error, self-serving bias and self-fulfilling prophecy. its amazing how these ideas play out in our lives at all moments but we never really notice. false attributino error is when say, you do something weird, and i say "you did somethign weird because you ARE weird." but when I do something weird, i think to myself "well, i only acted weird this one time because of such and such circumstantial reason." self-serving bias is pretty self explanatory. we do things for our own perosnal benefit most of the time. did you know that in a survey of hundreds of people who "ranked who would go to heaven (or not)," more people (87%) thought that they would go to heaven themselves than people who thought mother theresa would go to heaven (73% or so)!! self-fulfilling prophecy is when what i think will happen becomes what occurs. we subconsciously act out our predictions, positive or negative. definitely gives a big boost to teh importance of PMA! :) ok, my first two tests of the semester are tomorrow, so i best get going. more later.    As of February 18, 2002.   i realized that in this minibio, I have yet to actually put much about my biographical info. So here it is.  Sanjida is known to sleep little, talk much, and be so busy that people have asked her if there are two of her on campus. Sanjida was born in Cincinnati, OH and has lived in Ohio for the majority of her life. She is a junior at CWRU, double majoring in Biochemistry and Psychology. She intends to pursue an MD/PhD in neurology/neuroscience once she graduates in 2003. Currently she does independent research at Louis Stokes VAMC on an antipsychotic drug called Risperidone (Risperdal, commercially). Sanjida has worked actively with CWRU's Muslim Student Association and Muslim Campus Outreach group since 1999. She has further been involved with several Muslim youth groups, camps and seminars since high school. At CWRU, she is also a Resident Assistant in a dorm building, and a Teaching Assistant for an introductory biology lab. In addition, she has been president of CWRU Intercultural Dialogue Group for a year now. In her "spare time," she likes to volunteer at UH and the Free Clinic, play violin, go shopping with her sisters, listen to all kinds of music, write poetry, paint, watch movies, and take long walks with friends.

      January 1, 2002  Wow. I'll be 22 this year (and I just turned 21 yesterday. Gotta love that new years eve bday..). I didnt have a party. too many people were out of town, and out of a favor to my mom, I thought I'd make it a family night. So, my family and I went out to eat at Bravo! and afterwards watched Shrek on teh bigscreen at home. To welcome teh new year, i found Jupiter and Saturn in the sky overhead outside in my front yard. The ball was just too much hype for me. I love new york, but seriuosly, theres planets in the sky that are not always visible.. versus a bunch of lightbulbs? Please...! such an easy decision! it was also really cool to be outside just after midnight, instead of by the TV. you could hear the screaming in everyones houses, and the noisemakers and fireworks and stuff...what a celebration! Why sit on the couch at home? For my birthday, I had a piece of tiramisu with one candle in it. No one felt like buying or making a cake, and I dont even like cake all that much, so piya arranged to get me tiramisu at Bravo! and my family gave me a hopeless rendition of happy birthday at the dinner table. hey, at least I got Calamari fritti earlier on. YUM!:)   ANYWAZ. So many thoughts I have been meaning to jot down. I got back into my journal-ing. It has definitely been a missing love in my life. I hope to write a lot before I go back to school: poetry, fiction, inspiration, whatever I can get my mind to churn out. There were some initial plans to possibly go to NYC this week, but I don't know if that's working out or not.   So I was thinking about something recently, it's a helpless and haughty thought I assure you, but I will share. "A twist of fate and I would have been raised on the rice paddies of a Bengal village." Actually, that would be kind of beautiful I think? I've seen the village, and its so serene and innocent! At least it was in 1989, yes its true, I have neglected the homeland for over 12 years now. I really haven't had much say in the decision making process. Three years ago I wanted to go back to visit, after I graduated. It didn't happen due to family issues. Since then my own dream has been to go make umrah with my family and go to Bangladesh for a month or so. Problem is, the political condition of Bangladesh is awful. Hartal (strikes, which often become very violent) are all over the country... roads, even cities, are closed for them. Mafia-style crime is rampant as well, in addition extreme Islam is rising. At this point, it is literally life-threatening for a woman to travel the streets alone. And yet, I look back to racing my 4 yr old brother to the nearest vendor to buy a Fanta and some "chanachur" with the allowance my grandfather gave us (when I was 6). I never did take the time to know my grandfather on my dads side (Dadu) very well, I was too young to understand, but I do remember how much he loved us. He cherished me particularly because I was his first grandchild. Wrote me a song for my aqiqah, which was held belated in Bangladesh (perhaps so my dadu could attend), that all my relatives sang to me.   My most precious memory though is a simple letter. My dadu wrote me a letter at the end of January 1991 (I was 10). He asked me why I hadn't written to him, how he was getting old and would be leaving the world soon, that the sound of my voice (specifically, when I spoke English), was like music to his ears, that grandchildren and grandparents historically are best friends, but I hadn't kept up my end of the deal. Within three weeks, he died of a stroke, inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun. It was my grandfather's last letter. :(  Looking back, I don't know if there was anything else I could do to heal. My dad was stationed away from home during the Gulf war (Army medical reserve). I missed him so much, and I was helping my mom with the "new baby" (Piya) and my two younger sibs. At school, my teacher would take extra time with me to talk about the war going on, how I felt, I would write letters to Saratoga soldiers (the Saratoga was the ship that sank a couple of years later) with my class, because my teacher's son was on it too, I still have all the pictures of soldiers and American flags and peace signs that I would sit and draw with my brother (and then ask my mom to choose which was "best".. of course, we both were..;P). I regretfully think, because my Dadu had passed away far from home, and I hadn't been there to see it, and my dad was also away from home, and I wasn't seeing his pain, I moved away from the sad news terribly quickly. For a 10 yr old, perhaps that was best, the Qadr of Allah (Destiny from God). Once, about 2 years ago, when I was very sick, I saw Dadu in a dream, with my boro chacha (who was killed in the 1971 war) and they were telling me some beautiful comforting things. The words themselves, I don't remember specifically. But still, I'll treasure that too. I do hope to see them again One Day.   Oh yes, Bangladesh, when I arrived there at age 6 with my parents and brother (sister number one was still in Mom's tummy), we got off the plane, walked down the stairs (there was no walkway) and were immediately surrounded by a crowd of people, the beggars. "Paisa den bhai.." (please give some coins). My brother and I were frightened at the grabbing hands, the thinness, the shouting and pushing. My dad pulled out his change, American coins because he had not yet exchanged it for Bengali currency. One woman picked up a dime, and then put it down in preference for a penny, which was larger and a different color? by that point we understood what was happening and my brother and I tried to yell at her to come back "Hey, that's just a penny! Take a dime!" But she didn't know English, and our Bengali, well.. it sucked at that point. I don't think I will ever forget that scene.   Another scene I will never forget, and perhaps this is a subconscious root to my feminaziness, was at the mosque. In Bangladesh, women typically don't attend the mosque, or if they do, they go after the men have prayed and left. I remember looking down from my dadu's balcony and seeing the men flocking to the mosque next door after adhan (how I MISS that! It echoed through the sky, I thought the whole world could hear it!) and then 20 minutes later, a much smaller flock of women in their salwar kameez and dupatta. Since my mom did not have a habit of attending the mosque (when she was young she was taught that women didn't have to go, so she only goes on Eid), my dad took me with him during the men's time. Bear in mind, I was a 6 yr old. You know how 6 yr olds come: short, cute, often disproportionately lanky? So there I was 6 yr old me.. still innocent and little, going with Daddy to the mosque. It was very very hot, so I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. As I sat with my dad after salat, and he did something else next to me (sunnah perhaps? my memory is fuzzy on this point), I was looking around the room. An old man in front of me, with a long beard, turned around and sneered at me! He stuck out his tongue and kinda gave me an evil stare, I looked at my dad but he was still praying. I looked back at the man, and he looked at my legs and did the evil sneer face thing again. I seriously think he was condemning that I wore shorts to the mosque. I was 6! Anyway, that was my first experience with intolerance and modesty-patrol (which I will explain later). Thus, this has been a bit of my past geneology. It has its sadness, but it as human as any other. I do not wish to end here. I still have more to share.  Modesty-patrol is what I have come to call the people who have nothing better to do during salat (prayer), but make sure that everyone else is covered and non-nailpolished. For example, some woman at the mosque I attend is a modesty-patrolwoman. More than once, it has happened that during sujud, my hijab slips to the side, so a bit of hair peeps out the bottom. This woman literally starts tugging at my hijab while I am praying to fix it. I understnd that perhaps she is trying to save me from jahannam, which is why I don't' confront her or complain in public (except on the internet, and only anonymously!). But really, have you ever had someone PULLING ON YOUR HEAD while you were trying ot concentrate on prayer to your Lord? It's a little unnerving. More so because we are in the sisters section, where not a male in the universe is allowed to set foot, and there is no one but other women there anyway. Other modesty-patrol people scan toes during Ruku. I've seen it out the corner of my eye.. some woman is glaring at my toes? oops.. Sorry ma'am .. I had no nailpolish remover left for today, astaghfirAllah (May God forgive me). "Allah looks not at your bodies or your forms, but at your hearts and your deeds." We can all learn from this. Modesty Patrol people can relax. Accidents happen, mistakes happen. We are human. Let us pray!   I guess I shouldn't be soo overtly cynical. Perhaps they are better than I am and perhaps their intentions to help their sister are more pure than my negligence. Another example of modesty-patrol that I find more humorous than anything else occurred when tamina was alive. We walked into the brothers section of the mosque to advertise for IAW (because we didn't have any brothers volunteer, besides, who cares, we were covered head to toe like we were supposed to be..),so we walk in. the room fell silent, all 30+ of the men were in awe.. (how dare they!!!!).. some small conversations continued.. we started to hang up the flyers, not saying a word to anyone.. but the room was still uncomfortably quiet, and some brothers left? I felt like a harlot. Scarlet Letter anyone? Some random brothers came up to us and very courteously told us the directions to get to the "sisters section" (salam sister, the other sisters are down that hallway)? if I wasn't polite, I would have told him, "yes brother we know.. we just came OUT of there.." but instead I just kept my mouth shut and let tamina explain our MSA publicizing purposes. Eventually we got to speak with one of the higher-ups who didn't mind having us there. I have to ask, "sisters rooms" (with the TV broadcast of the imam's pulpit) could not possibly exist prior to 50 years ago. So how is this sunnah?  Such thoughts and memories scramble through my mind at times. but so much else too! Latest procrastination tactic: finding englsih translations to my favorite hindi songs. There is so much beauty in their meanings that I was unaware of before! I found a "me" song too! "Mein Albeli" from the movie Zubeidaa, always had a special ring to it and I love listening to the song. The dance too, is really cute. The lyrics though, bear an uncanny resemblance to me. Check it out. :)    I am lovely, I wander alone, I am an enigma... The mad winds may take me anywhere I am a friend of these winds I am a deer in the forest, a bud in the flower garden Sometimes I am dew; sometimes I am a flame Mine, the hundred shades of dawn and dusk In the end, even I do not know exactly what I am (You are lovely, you wander alone, an enigma, an enigma...) Such is my share of troubles: No matter where I go, my heart worries God knows where my restlessness might take me I'm here one moment, there the next. (You are crazy, you are capricious) (You've been raised in a world of dreams) In the end, even I do not know exactly what I am (O, you are lovely...) I am the traveler without a destination I am that longing which knows no object I am the wave that has no shore My heart is fragile... My heart is not made of stone (You are ignorant, you are insane) (You've come to a world of stone with a heart of glass) (You are lovely, you wander alone, you're an enigma) (The mad winds may take you anywhere) (You are a friend of these winds) ~A.R. Rahman's "Mein Albeli" from the movie _Zubeidaa_ For more hindi song lyrics in english, check out Bollywatch.com. I was thinking about these lyrics a lot. A sole wandering enigma, carrying a heart of glass in a world of stone. That's me. I'm not sayign I'm upset, no shattering glass here... In fact, its the opposite. There is a certain freedom and peace in being a wanderer. I have been blessed in my journey to have encountered such peace as much of the world bears only as a pipe dream. But that is the essence of peace, at least in my current philosophical moment... a glass heart in a world of stone.. is peace. Its beautiful, fragile, and its clarity is such that some can't even see its presence... Latest favorite movie: Lord of teh rings all the way. Its ridiculous how some peopel find hte "ending was stupid." My gosh. My favorite character was Aragorn.. he's so cute, a valiant prince (big girly sigh, lutfi-style)! Ok, really, my favorite character was Gandalv. So wise and good. "I wish I had never been given teh ring. I wish none of thsi had happened." "Dear Frodo, waht has happend has happened. it is what you will do with what has happened in the time you have left that will matter." Another favorite line that echoes in my mind simply because Cate Blanchett said it sooo well.... "Aha.I have passed the test. Now I shall go off.. into the East.. and forever remain... Geladriel..." Also, I love when the Dwarf says "NOBODY TOSSES A DWARF!" finally, "Even the smallest of creatures can change the course of the universe" (geladriel again). Oh yes, and Legalos has amazign hair. I maen, it woudl be more amazing if he wa s girl, cuz he looks awfully girlish with that hairstyle.. but its so shiny and long. I mean, and this is unanimous between my sisters and I, but he had the best long hair in the whole movie, even better than Liv and Cate's! Man, the irony, eh? If you havent' seen this flick yet, you definitely* should (and you should definitely invite me because I will definitely go with you.. I cant pass this one up!.. "inshAllah" to all of the above). LOTR is an excellent movie, perhaps the best I have seen in a very very long time.   i watched LOTR in Nashville when I went during Christmas weekend to visit my relatives. Pics are up on my old site. Go to the homepage to get the link. It is always a great experience getting together with my mom's side of the family. We are way artsy on that side. Song, dance, music, abounds. We have three professional musicians on that side of the family. And of course, I'm a dancer like my mommy. :) In fact, my sister and i held a dance show when we were there, for all the ladies. They taped out craziness. We came up with a really dirty dance for "No. 1 panjabi." I mean, its not dirty dirty, its just really modern, kinda hip hop, more than I'm used to ever doing in public...it threw our "older audience" for a loop. ;P I refuse to repeat that dance for any male I'm not married to! (HAHA, I'm posting this later, and I have DEFINITELY danced dirtier for many men I have no intention of marrying. Just an aside. I'll butt out of my old post now) Aside from that, we did some cute ones to "bumbro," a hilarious rendition of "chori chori chupke chupke" (think.. what else do people do "on the sly and surreptitiously?"), "mehndi," "humko humise" was a flop, as was "pairon mein bandhan hain," but "nimbooda" was ok (got cut off on the tape). My rendition of "Radha kaise na jale" was really good, according to the feedback i got from my mom, but we didnt get it on tape. oops. Quick! Shoma's favorite hindi movies! Lajja, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Lagaan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Taal, Chori Chori Chupke Chupke  OK, I think I'm drained of thoughts for the moment, or perhaps I'm making excuses because I'm sick of typing. As soon as my computer learns to dictate, you'll get much more out of me. :P  Later on, I'll try and write about the following things that will take more time than I currently have available...Rookie/Sanjida conversations on gender relations and modesty in Islam.... Lutfi/Shoma conversations on the "predictable downward spiral of Shoma's interest in her crushes" (at least he says so...)...Dadima/Bitiyarani conversations on the meaning of life, the method of living life, and other way too deep issues...and of course, more on shoma's fave hindi flicks  In closing, here is a beautiful lullaby from the song Mission Kashmir? it is "So ja chanda" (sleep, lovely moonlight child..). Shoma means moon, my birthday was on Monday, and I found this song on my birthday. InshAllah, whenever I have someone to sing to sleep... (another big girly sigh)   Sleep, my lovely moonchild; sleep, my prince. Come to the world of dreams; come. The sleep-fairies are here wearing anklets on their feet.

      I didn't expect to be writing again so soon. But I am a little upset.  I sent out a petition to help Muslim women. Here is the response of a brother...    Brother: I do understand what you are saying about the women of Afghanistan ... but the thing is what you hear is it the Total Truth?, what is your source and from what point of view are you looking at this issue? with all respect and humbleness, Almighty Allah knows the best, I don't know much about the Taliban Govt. and just like me there are thousands of Muslims and nonmuslims here in USA. So whatever i know is what I hear on the Western TV. and news paper run by Western people, So how real and true are these sources ?? .... So my question is what is your source, and how strong and real is it? Until you are sure of something, don't speak of it. I suggest you do more research on this issue.   So of course I wrote back vehemently... what? why do our superficial egos tell us that we gotta keep our mouths shut if someone who claims* to be like us is doing somethign utterly WRONG?   This is what I wrote.   Me: Thank you for your comments. I appreciate that you wrote back to me. Not to belittle anything you have said, because I understand you mean it in best interest, but I have heard this skeptical comment before. The interesting point? I hear this always from brothers, never from sisters. out of curiosity, do you believe what the taliban demanded of women was islamic in any way? i am a practicing hijabi and believe in it. i chose it against my mothers wishes. i have studied the concerns of women in afghanistan in depth. i support the petition not because of who is promoting it but simply because I do not beleive that the so-called "Islamic state" the taliban had started is at all Islamic. some statements in the petition description may be worded incorrectly. however, I believe that the main objective, obtaining the women's rights as human beings is clear, and that is what I am keeping in mind. I'm for truth, no matter who tells it. I'm for justice, no matter who it is for or against. I'm a human being first and foremost, and as such I'm for whoever and whatever benefits humanity as a whole. Malcolm X i read 30 books on this "issue" of Muslim women of afghanistan and abroad and wrote a 40 page paper abotu muslim women. i've spoken at countless forums about muslim women. Women in Afghan, who were renown and excellent surgeons/businesswomen/lawyers before the Taliban came along, were made to lose their jobs and be secluded in their homes SIMPLY and ONLY because they were female. The taliban stopped educating their women, why? it was against the law to educate a girl. mashallah some sisters began underground schools to teach their daughters. there are public beatings of women, which i have seen footage of. 12 year old boys are given "guardianship" of 4 or 5 older women. It is not false propaganda. It DOES happen. I hate that muslims all over the world are keeping silent in the face of such injustice, simply because the unjust ones are labeled as Muslims. beign muslim isnt impunity. we WILL be asked one Day. so we should fear that and remember. so why is this? because the "degree above" women that taliban believe men have is apparently as high as teh sky! because women are "weak in religion and intellect" (an absolutely false statement attributed as 'hadith' in some areas of the world). if that is the case, then why was Ayesha (ra) the Prophet Muhammad's favorite wife? she was educated, she was modest, she was strong, and argued, she* taught men* religious knowledge and medicine... even treating Abdallah (ra) as close as a son. she never had children of her own, and she expressed her jealousy of the other wives. she was beloved by the Prophet (Saws), so much that he died in her arms. a real strong woman, mashAllah not the stupid barbie doll that the Taliban think women are. and also, why is fighting and killing one another, even other muslims, such a priority for them? what about hadith that guarantee paradise to any parent who raises a daughter and gives her a good education and good marriage? what about the hadith that the strongest person is not the one who wins at a fistfight but the one who controls their anger? what about the hadith that said "now we go from the lesser jihad (war) to the greater jihad (jihad of the nafs, the battle against your inner self)? where is their mercy? I suggest you do more reading and contemplating. Do you honestly believe that our Merciful Lord wishes these conditions for women? Do you believe this is how women lived during the time of our Prophet (saws)? Peace, Sr Sanjida

      As of December 7, 2001  So today was the last day of Fall Semester 2001. I still have 2 papers, a quiz, and 7 finals to take. however, I felt this would be a good writing point too. Honestly, I've been craving some alone time to just gush all my thoughts freelance onto paper, no time limit, no reality limit.. just throw it out quietly to the universe, and be safe in letting go of my background noise (worries, negative thoughts, sadness, fears). I recently lost a friend in a tragic car accident. She was an inspirational girl who touched all the lives she knew (and THEN SOME).   Spiritually, intellectually, even physically, I've accepted her passing. Though I know that I could, I am not going to take this opportunity to gush and rave all about her life. We have all done that and those of us who knew her well know that words are not necessary to understand those simple qualities about her that made her so special to us all. In this critical time, many of my friends have lauded my "strength" and "energy".. "how do you do it Sanjida?" I hear...And yes I know I tend to be off the wall at times... that I can be the world's greatest actress if it helps me get through a difficult time... that I love to have fun, but more than that, see that my loved ones are happy... and my loved ones grow in quantity day by day...   If only they knew.. after all whatever it is that I do is yet so small.   I remember Sr Aminah (my mentor) said once that since she accepted Islam, her heart expanded to be filled with love for all of Allah ta'alas Craetions...that at times, she felt so loved and loving, that she feared her heart may burst with positive energy...wow... what a state of Iman (faith)..   I realized yesterday that with 9-11 and Islam awareness becoming a major issue, as well as Tamina's death, and the 23 credit hours, and the campus job, and extracurriculars, and a social life... this has been one CRAZY BUSY semester... I feel at once, that i have lost so much and yet gained even more. in Ecclesiastes it says "To everything there is a season..." and in Asr it says "By Time, verily, man is in loss." That is SO true. This was the time for me and those around me to be tried, in our faith, in our actions, in our characters.   Well, to give the abridged update of S life, I'm back into playing violin. i love it with a new passion. I saw Midori perform last night at the Orchestra and it was so absolutely beautiful I was not only awestruck but speechless.   I've learned to defer stress for teh finer thigns in life.. friends, love, sleep, chocolate, smiles and hugs... Such amazing healing mechanisms in all of these.   I have much more I wish to share with, um, my secret admirer? Who else would come here? but alas, I am exhausted and my bed is beckoning with that come hither look that I just cannot resist... gnight friends.

      As of October 1st, 2001  Random Rambling and Grumbling from me. Ok, ok. it's been an insanely long time. I know I never update this thing. I should. My apologies to my fans who come and read this obsessively. :) ... This summer, I did research on rats. i took teh MCAT. I became an RA. yes "life as an RA" is good. Believe me, I prefer not to identify myself as anythign besides a Muslimah. every other identity is a peripheral thing. The most important thign about me is my faith. i think I've become more spiritual, but less religious. Does that make sense? It is a common trend in our society, and I hope its not something that is just a fad (liek my vegetarianism back in high school). I am more focused on developing sincerity, havinga good worldview, and trust in Allah to get me through the storms of life, rather than obsessing over the correctness of certain miniscule issues (i.e. make up and stuff). I know I may not be the most "correct" person on earth.. but i am trying to do the best I can while maintaining room to be myself.  I plan to pierce my nose eventually. I don't know when.  ... I'm still a biochem and psychology major.. premed.. I want to go into an MD PhD progtram in the future, hopefully.  ... The latest book I read and loved was "my many colored days" by Dr Seuss.. its one of those cardboard books for toddlers.. btu I'm telling you.. its a LITERARY MASTERPIECE. The latest album I listened to and loved was "look into the eyeball" by david byrne.. which, incidentally, I just burned from my new friend. Adam, just today. :) its really upebat and i like the lyrics. Again though, many of you know my trend of being obsesed with some album for a couple of weeks and then tossing it aside for something novel.. so lets see how this one goes. :)  My favorite movie is hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.. as usual. :) Nothing beats Aishwarya rai's dancing in that flick. I wish I could dance like that.  my biggest pet peeve right now is having a good hair day at 2 am. which is my current state. UGGGH. ... i'm still teh night owl caffeine addict that I've always been..  I'm also idealistic, as usual, and prefer world peace over al the turbulence being caused everywhere. i'm sortve in a weird position as an American Muslimah. And I realized today, that i really dont have any connection, desire, or skill to assimilate into the modern islamic" world in  the middle east.. theres so much cultural, tribal, adn political separation over there, and i find that very contrary to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (saws).  Also, in conclusion, i am doing just fine. i am stressed out (again, as usual).. . I mean, as I mentioned to Ro the oter day, I dumped stress long ago.. i told Stress to get lost.. that I was too good for him.. but he still stalks me.. and I'm working on getting a restraining order.. Any Stress Lawyers out there? take care all. gnight. ma salama

      It seems the whole world has gone Blog these days. Or maybe that's just the two people I've been hanging out with for the past week. In any case, this Blog, my new home in cyberspace, has arrived in due time. I have several posts, poems, commentary, and quotes from two earlier websites (Geocities '96-'02 and LiveJournal '02-'03) to transfer to this Blog over the next few weeks (hopefully). It will surely be a tedious process, but, I hope, well worth it for all of you. Be sure to stop by later and check it out! Ciao.

      I spent three hours at the Aveda institute today and now, not only do I smell totally fantabulous, but my hair is so dark I could hide my cat in it.  And who knew my natural color is actually dark brown and not black? Sehr interresant!

      A+ Harold and Kumar go to White Castle  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll squirm with disgust, and you'll probably laugh some more. This is the funniest movie I've seen ALL summer.  It reminds me of nights in Cleveland where we'd pack a couple of cars and set out trying to find Shaker Square or an open grocery store after 9 PM or the "Denny's off Richmond" that we STILL have not found (!). We always wound up somewhere in the ghetto or the boonies, but of course, we didn't run into NPH (Neal Patrick Harris) or runaway cheetahs or Freakshow (so yeah, you'll just have to watch the flick). The moral of the adventure of course is, the value of the destination comes from the journey--and the company. I also have to point out that although its not a huge part of this movie, it really takes 1st generation humor, which is so often "insider,"and makes it known to the world. Parent pressure, social stigmas, language barriers, cultural expectations, etc.; I love that this stuff is hitting mainstream media. It makes an ABCD like me feel more at home. ABCD (American Born Confused Desi).  And as for its funniest movie of the summer ranking, that is in competition with White Chicks (B+) and Dodgeball (C+) and Saved! (A-).  Check those out too.

      Waaaaay too cute to pass up. Check it out.   Julie: Yeah, indian guys are just confused. They are all shy... can't talk to girls. And they don't know if they're white or black or what! It's like "Yo homie, let's go play some tennis, yaar?" :P

      Back in the day,&nbsp;my high school radio station used to play music over the PA system between bells for Spirit Week. The song they played the most often was "Freefalling" by Tom Petty and its been one of my favorite songs ever since.   I knew there had to be a reason.   Here's the full story of my first skydiving experience, my own personal account:   For a full 24 hours, I was pumped, and way too excited to study. I was on the phone talking to people, friends in Cbus and elsewhere, getting tips from veteran skydivers,&nbsp;visualizing the jump,&nbsp;and&nbsp;even getting a couple of "farewell" hugs from Ruthann and Victoria (which did freak me out a little).&nbsp;&nbsp;Then around 3 PM Friday,&nbsp;it came time for Aaron and me to go to Richmond. About 20 minutes into the drive, it really hit me that&nbsp;going skydiving&nbsp;was no longer just a fun idea, but a real experience, we were REALLY going to go do this thing. HOLY SHIT MAN! That was a crazy realization, or maybe it was then that I realized I was actually crazy. Crazy or not, from what I remember, we listened to some good CDs, hid our nerves best we could, and finally&nbsp;arrived at&nbsp;a&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;airport outside Richmond, IN where we met Donny and his friend Kevin.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The people at the office were fun-spirited and really nice. That made me feel a little better right away. But then came waivers. I think I signed in at least 15 or more places that I "understood that skydiving is a dangerous sport" that I "understand that I could be killed or mangled in efforts to skydive" and that I "will not hold Wayne County Skydiving accountable should these events happen." All those nerves I had overcome during the drive came back like a flood as I signed those. It was a slow and steady reality check. And to top it off, I made a nice dent in my credit card as I paid for the whole experience.   Training took about 2 minutes! My instructor, Jason, gave us a quick overview on plane exiting postures&nbsp;and pointed out where the ripcord was for the parachute. I started to get really nervous when I realized I missed that part about the ripcord!   Donny and Kevin decided to go first, so Aaron and I watched as they got all suited up in the UGLIEST jumpsuits imaginable. They were navy blue and neon orange. Truly disgusting. Anyway, it only took a few minutes for them to climb into their gear, and then got on board the tiny plane. It took literally forever&nbsp;until they finally parachuted down, but they made it down safely. It was good to see them. I knew then that I would survive my own jump. Thanks guys.  Then it was time for Aaron and me to go. While Aaron got to&nbsp;wear a larger size&nbsp;black and red jumpsuit, I&nbsp;sported Donny's used navy blue and orange one. Yeah I know. I paid 159 bucks to wear my friends sweaty jumpsuit? But it was too late to turn back. The thing was way too long on me, and&nbsp;when&nbsp;I got my gear on finally, the whole middle part of the jumpsuit wrinkled up like a scrunchie. Eeeeww. Ah well, I&nbsp;WAS intending to jump out of a plane not&nbsp;pose for a&nbsp;girly mag.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Once we were all suited up, the instructor guys started making fun of me cuz I was nervous. They would ask eachother "Hey, did you check her gear? Don't mind that guy that you're jumping with, he's new." ETC. It kind of worked though, because in laughing at myself I remembered to&nbsp;relax again&nbsp;and have fun.   So, we climbed into a Cessna jet the size of a Mazda Miata. It was so small the only way for me to sit down was to have my legs entangled with my instructors, which I honestly didn't mind. ;P  And poor Aaron was squashed between the pilot and the door of the plane. The way we were all sitting, I couldn't see Aaron at all. That was hard because I was REALLY nervous once we got on the plane, and it would have been nice to have my buddy around. Thing is, when I'm nervous I get quiet. And to beat it, I have to talk. So I ended up talking to the instructors for the whole 30 minute (?)&nbsp;climb to 11,000 ft. I&nbsp;know I was definitely nervous because in addition to asking them EVERY&nbsp;SINGLE question I could think of about skydiving, I even talked to them about our MD PhD program and our 7 yrs-7 jumps deal and how I hadn't told my mom and how&nbsp;she would be sooo mad at me,&nbsp;yada yada... Sure it might have bored them to tears, but I felt sooooo much better. I bet these instructors hear a lot of great stuff during the flights up.&nbsp;&nbsp;   At least the instructors sang me a song together. "Fly fly fly your plane, gently through the sky... Merrily merrily merrily merrily, we're about to die!" And it was even in tune. Lovely. :P Oh, and then, sometime around 7,000 ft, one of the instructors asked Aaron and me if we had ever felt zero gravity. I didn't know what he meant, and then next thing I knew, the plane took a nosedive for 5 seconds and we all&nbsp;FLOATED in the cabin! Aaron somehow wound up in our section of the plane, and somebody's pen landed in my gear but we sorted all that out real quick.&nbsp;Zero gravity&nbsp;was TRULY an amazing feeling. It makes me want to be an astronaut. :)   We soon reached 11,000 ft altitude and it was time to go. The instructors hooked themselves to our gear and tightened everything. When my guy asked me how I felt, I told him I was ready to go. My body might have been shaking but that was all that was in my head: Cmon, Bring it. :) I watched as Aaron climbed out onto the step and next thing I knew he was gone! If reality hadn't hit me fullforce yet, it did then. I climbed out there myself and crouched the way they had showed us. As I sat out there for a couple seconds and looked out, I was astounded that I had even made it that far. And next thing I knew, Rock, 1, 2, 3.... and I was airborne!   The initial shock&nbsp;can&nbsp;pretty much be summed up as "What the hell?!?!" I think I was reaching for something to hold onto or step on, and then next thing I knew, I was on my back, watching our plane fly away without us. As I rolled over to face ground again, I finally remembered that I still had an instructor attached to me and I had to position myself accordingly. Apparently I kicked my instructor in the butt around that time. But he was nice about it. We did some horizontal spins, which I loved. And then, it was time to check the altimeter and pull the ripcord. As I mentioned before, I missed that crucial bit of info in our rapid training course, so I tugged at something that I thought* was my ripcord, and it obviously wasn't! The altimeter was going down fast though, we were at 5,500,&nbsp;so I pointed at my instructor and he found it and pulled it for me. &nbsp;I think I'm going to regret that until next year's jump. I've got to pull my own cord!&nbsp;   When the parachute deployed, I felt a huge TUG upwards at my shoulders and my legs.&nbsp; That was when I really took in the view. My first words were "WOW. That was the most amazing thing I have ever EVER done." I totally loved parachuting. It was a slow descent with an awesome view. And the instructor even arranged to do a quick fly-by near Aaron's parachute. We weren't the greatest conversationalists in the air. I think I screamed "Whoohoo!!" and he said "HI!" I distinctly remember hootin and hollerin all the way down in my parachute. I felt like I was at a rodeo or something and all I could do was celebrate how much fun I was having. I figured, dammit, the world needs to know. :P And from hundreds of feet away, Aaron could hear me. But ohh, my poor instructor. Hehe.  About four minutes after our parachutes opened, we hit the ground, with a "tippy toe soft landing" as promised on the website. And what a reception! Donny and Kevin had recruited a member of the office staff and they all met us out on the field. Cameras going off, hugs all around, high fives. It was awesome. And the instructors even showed up with certificates and "report cards" of our dives. I felt like I had won some big prize. And I think, in fact, I had. Sappy as it sounds, I had definitely won&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;degree of faith in my own courage, willpower, and independence. GO ME.  After a TON of phone calls, Aaron and I celebrated on the drive home by having a&nbsp;steak and ribs dinner at TGI Friday's, and playing&nbsp;our favorite Game Show Network&nbsp;trivia game.&nbsp;Can I just make one point about steak and ribs though? Have you ever changed your order at a restaurant because someone else you're with ordered the same thing? Aaron refused to order the New York Strip steak when he realized I was ordering it. Since when do I have a monopoly on New York Strip steak? I'm glad he was happy with his ribs, but after seeing the guy jump from a plane, I thought food ordering would be a more trivial matter, no? Touche. I made up for it by letting him win the trivia game in the restaurant. ;P  In reflection, the day was&nbsp;exciting, memorable, and life-altering. After enjoying the air, it felt unreal somehow to be on the ground again, doing normal things like eating and&nbsp;driving and using the phone. It felt that way for all of Saturday too. Life was so blase again, back to biostatistics class as usual, and it was hard to believe that the whole experience had even happened. In the back of my mind though, all I could think about was the skydive, and how I would&nbsp;improve next time, and how I still cannot believe I&nbsp;got myself to do it.&nbsp;But I DID. And I guess that means I can do anything I put my mind to.&nbsp;  And as for the question, will I ever go back and do it again? Well, in addition to Aaron and my 7 yrs-7 jumps deal, I honestly think I left my heart in the sky. &nbsp;Guess I'll just have to go back and get it now, won't I? :)

      So I DID IT.   Today, I&nbsp;dove out of a plane flying at 11, 000 ft above the earth ... with&nbsp;my trusty trained professional strapped to my back. And I'm still here to tell the story.  Which I'll have to tell later this weekend because I am EXHAUSTED.   But I did it. I definitely did it.  As a random thot to fill the post, the music replaying in my head right now is: "Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away..." ~Frank Sinatra  Apropo, no? And oh yeah, I did it. Damn straight I did.

      I've had Biostatistics class day in and day out since last Saturday. "Welcome to the wonderful world of pie charts." "What is the correlation of # of beans eaten&nbsp;and # of smelly farts?" "If the average student in this class requires three cups of coffee to stay awake, what is the probability that the professor will say something interesting?" Arrrgh.   So what's the probability that&nbsp;I'm going to  urlLink jump out of a plane  tomorrow? Its lookin like a 100% baby! Donny, Aaron and I are going to jump tandem from 14,000 ft, with a 50 second free fall, and hitting terminal velocity around 130 mph. Wooow.&nbsp;If blogs don't appear by the weekend, do worry about me.   I'm sooooo excited though. I haven't been able to study all night. Just been talkin on the phone with old friends and planning my New York trip for August. I caught up with New Yorker Nina and Jersey Boy Lutfi. And who knew that both of them had gone skydiving before? They said I'd be scared to death but I'd love it. That's definitely how I'm feeling right about now. I guess no amount of preparation and coaching can really get me ready for the real thing.   The pre-thrill is making me antsy.   My biggest fear as I get ready for this? That they'll open the airplane doors before I'm strapped to my trained professional and I'll get sucked out of the plane sans parachute.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Luckily,&nbsp;Soumya says that can't be possible because the negative air pressure inside the plane sucks air IN, but I don't know if our plane will be pressurized or not.   I guess we'll see how it goes tomorrow. Regardless, the probability of having a great time? 150%  Blog ya soon!

      And a final thot for the day... I am SOOO excited for Sharmin's wedding. I just gotta let it out. I mean, I gotta admit it&nbsp;freaks me out&nbsp;that she's getting married. She's two years younger than me after all. But I'm still pumped because it's gonna be one of those four day traditional Bengali weddings, complete with the bridal blessing, groom blessing (the "gayer holuds"), wedding ceremony/reception ("beeay"), and groom's party("bowbhaat"). Lots of fun outfits to wear and people to meet. And so many old friends are gonna be there that I haven't seen in ages. There will be Hadele and Soumya and Samara and Sadaf... and I'm especially excited to see my old buddies Yasir and Rukhsana (Rookie), and of course Sharmin. :)&nbsp;My fam and I will&nbsp;be staying with my dance student and her family (Sakura, the little girl I taught dance to last year) so it will be good to see them too. Only thing is, I'll be missing the ISNA (Islamic Society of North America) conference in Chicago for the first time in five years. I guess I'll survive tho. It'll do to&nbsp;see all my friends at the wedding instead of Chicago.&nbsp;And it will definitely be sad to see my little&nbsp;Sharmin go. So, all y'all going to the wedding, see ya soon!!! :)

      Today, several engineering graduate students&nbsp;performing&nbsp;robotics research&nbsp;at Wright Patterson Air Force Base were humiliated in a robotics contest, by a HIGH SCHOOLER. The contest was to design and program a robot to pick up and carry three eggs across a room and put them in a basket without breaking them, in the shortest amount of time.  &nbsp; I am PROUD TO SAY, the high schooler that showed them how its done was none other than my very own 17 yr old sister, and future engineer elite, Leena Saklayen. She may not know how to drive a car from the grocery store back to her house, but dammit she can build you a robot! &nbsp; Given this scenario, I, as a graduate student, would move back to Bangladesh and "breed and feed" mini Bengalis for the rest of my life if a 17 year old had to show me how to dissect a brain out of a rat in 30 seconds or less. C'mon little snots... bring it. &nbsp;

      Continuing my movie reviews, reminiscent of the Critic, I give the following movies the following ratings.   B+&nbsp; Spiderman 2 (Special effects were amazing, but&nbsp;comic book villains are a little overdramatic&nbsp;for me and Kirsten Dunst's lines sucked.)  &nbsp;  B&nbsp; How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (Matthew McCoughnohay--sp?-- is sooo beautiful, but the ending was really hokey)  &nbsp;  B- &nbsp;I, Robot (Not the most intelligent of films. Given that, Will Smith is also beautiful, and so is his bare ass, which bumps this one up from a C) See  urlLink Aaron's rating  too. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  More when I see Anchorman, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, and The Terminal, among others.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      This week has been relatively quiet but as my loyal blogging audience, I have to update you. My mom underwent surgery Monday, a hysterectomy and appendectomy all in one (i.e. she had all sorts of little parts taken out). They did a biopsy and luckily nothing was cancerous. My dad was really nervous all the way up until they did the surgery, and I guess that was why. No one told&nbsp;us (my sisters and I) that cancer was even a question. Its funny how we sometimes&nbsp;protect people from vital information. Is it because we can't handle it or because we think they can't or because we're in denial or what? Regardless, I'm glad it wasn't cancer.  &nbsp;  And overall, things went well. I spent two nights at the hospital with my mom and then the&nbsp;next&nbsp;two nights she felt more comfortable staying by herself. Spending the night&nbsp;on the 5th floor of MVH&nbsp;was strange. Someone or another came in on the hour every hour. And in the meantime my mom was feelin a lot of pain so I talked with her and helped her walk to the bathroom every now and then. I gotta say, watching your mother shoot morphine every ten minutes is kind of interesting too. If there wasn't a limit on the pump I would probably have to worry about her. I think the craziest thing about the week was that after the sleepless nights, I left the hospital at 6:30 in the morning to stay home with my youngest sister so my dad and other sister&nbsp;could leave for work. Who knew that leaving the parking garage at 6:30 incurred no charge? How bout that.&nbsp;Although it wasn't easy&nbsp;being up so early, I have to admit, it was nice to see the sunrise again.  &nbsp;  Other memorable notes from the week include the lady voice in the hospital elevator that said "Going up." It sounded like a dumb cheerleader saying "going Uh-up!"&nbsp;I bet it would have flipped its hair in my face if it could, but it WAS an elevator after all. I swear I've never heard an elevator talk like this one did.&nbsp;Although I wanted to strangle that voice a few times during the course of the week, I do sortve miss it now. And oh yeah, is it just me or does every hospital in southwestern OH have a Wendy's? My youngest sister, Piya, and I starred in our own episode of Supersize Me, eating off the Super Value menu every day for a week. UUUGGGHH. I think I have liver cirrhosis.&nbsp;I'm telling myself I have to avoid fast food for a month. At least until New York (which I finally settled on, over a really if-y trip to Orlando).  &nbsp;  This morning was really cool too. As we drove to the hospital, my sister asked me if I saw words in the sky. And at first I thought she was crazy, but when I looked again, I saw a skywriter actually writing something. Along our half hour journey down St. Rt. 48, we read "AIRSHOW. WOMEN FLY. :)" You go girl. As we walked into the hospital though, something on the newstand caught my eye. It was a front page article about the nation's best female skywriter as the star of the Dayton Airshow this year! Guess I got a free show. :)  And among other ironies, being such a dedicated daughter and student, I had taken my endocrine notes with me to study at home. Little did I know, that after 106 pages of reading, I had been reading the wrong material! Thank goodness for a phone call from Aaron regarding the Cedar Point accident. We cleared it up real quick. So now, though I feel really good about myself, I'm a week behind. Gotta get back to business...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I was really close to finally getting integrated into the Bengali community in Columbus today. But this community picnic got rained out. Daimit! (That's how they say it in Indian movies!) I can't imagine it would be much different than the Cleveland community. Bengalis are so family-centered, showing up as a young single woman is like way taboo. My only saving grace is that I'm a dancer, and they all love that. Here's a runthrough of typical experiences as a young Bengali.  All the aunties (older women) want to know who your parents are and what they do (score 1 if your daddy's a doctor, score 2 if mom is as well), for future reference of course. They ask what you're doing in school (and to them, I am definitely doing the wrong thing in school.. after all, when will I ever get married?!?!)). They ask where in Bangladesh your family is from, and in my case, I know my parents birthplaces and thats about it. But I couldn't even point them out on a map if you showed me. They look you up and down, and spying my belly, they'll say "Ohhhh, you look so... healthy." Which means I really should point out that their's is ten times bigger. We got super healthy aunties over here. If you opt for Express over Indian clothes, you get glared at like you're wearing a brown paper bag with the word "Disenfranchised" on it. And let's not even get started on what would happen if I don't eat meat (which I don't sometimes cuz I'm not a fan, and I used to be all veg.). They talk about vegetarianism like its a mortal affliction. Let's see, anyone with a chid between the ages of 14 and 30, will introduce me to their female kid who's the "same age as you, you can be friends." And then of course, all they ever want is to get their kids married off, but then there's NO opportunity to meet any decent guys. Cuz why would a girl talk to a boy? God forbid men and women could interact without jumping eachothers bones. The attempts at sexual repression border on ridiculous. Especially knowing my generation doesn't follow the rules anyway. Hmm.. OK. I guess I'm not missing much by not going to this picnic thing.  And I love my culture. Really I do. There's so much color and poetry and art and beautiful clothing and music and great movies and the language is so pretty and the family values are so deep... but in practice, its just plain silly sometimes. OK, I'm done ranting and raving for the time being. :)

      It all started when I finally took my GI test. After nearly 5 weeks of preparation, and a morbid fascination with the word "poop" during the last week, I took the damn thing and PASSED with flying colors!!!! Altogether now, who's the shit? ME, ME and ME! I think I had nearly forgotten that great feeling of being transiently free of school, at least during this past month or so. There are times it feels I'll be studying the same thing for-freakin-ever. Its a great feeling to reach a milestone. The MD PhD program is plenty short of them.    With the test over and done, of course I took the rest of the weekend to celebrate! Friday night was pretty funny. First I cancelled on some friends who were going out for french food, with the promise that I could go see Jewel with other friends. Then, Basheer and Saqib and I spent an hour and a half cruising around PromoWest Pavilion trying to scalp tickets to the Jewel concert. After two tries with every scalper in sight, we gave up and headed to Zen Cha, my favorite little tea cafe. Basheer bought me a bubble tea to make up for the mess and knowing me and bubble tea, you can bet that made my day. We decided to head to Easton from there and saw Spiderman 2. Excellent movie, especially if you've seen the first one. I give it a B+. I know, I'm a little harsh. Movie critics have to be.  Day 2 of post-test partying involved a road trip to Sandusky and Cleveland. Aaron and Scott came with. We left at 7:30 in the morning to get to Cedar Point, taking every back road in the state of Ohio (or maybe just OH 250). The two and a half hour drive was a little much, but the guys made it bearable. It started to go a little downhill when they started dealing out IQ points to me for proper driving etiquette, and taking them away for the slightest mistake. I think by the end of the night I was somewhere between a dumb blonde and Forrest Gump. Yeah, apparently not a perfect driver. But dammit we made it there and back in one piece.   So with all this intraCamry drama, we eventually arrived at Cedar point and met up with my dear friend Soumya (Soums). The first ride we rode--Soums and I kicking, screaming, and praying the whole way--was Top Thrill Dragster. Shot out of an electromagnetic starter at 120 mph and going straight up and down 400 ft, with nothing but a lap bar to hold you back (Aaron says I'm obsessed with restraints, but I did used to work with them back at WPAFB) it was by far the most amazing thrill I have ever EVER experienced. If I remember correctly we were all in some hysterics as we got off that ride. Watching the ride is astounding enough, and lots of people did, but actually being in those seats is incomparable.    After that, we went on Millenium Force, which went 93 mph and was about 300-350 ft tall. Aaron bet me a corn dog that I wouldn't be able to put my arms up going down the hill. But the corn dog was too tempting. I went down that hill with my arms over my head thinking "I WANT MY COOOOOOORN DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG!!!!" Truly amazing what motivates me. The ride was really smooth, it felt like flying! Definitely my favorite ride in the park. And although I was too obsessed with the first hill to enjoy the view of Lake Erie very much, it was a great view as well.   Well, after those two amazing rides, it was back to the less intense, but fun ones. We rode the Iron Dragon (although I'm not sure why, it was STUPID) and then met up with Hadele, Mourad, Sogol, Shaker, Shabnam, Amir, and Daniel to ride the Gemini and the Magnum. Hadele and I are still twins. She has the same majors as me, is a CWRU hijabi on exec board of MSA, works with all the cultural dinners, and turns out, screams EXACTLY like me on rollercoasters. Same pitch, same duration, it was really freaky when we were riding Magnum together and it was like "AAAAAAAHH!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!  " at the exact same time! After that we split off from the CWRU group and Soums, Aaron, Scott and I rode the Raptor, which was a fun ride too. And then it was off to Cleveland.   We made it to Cleveland with plenty of time and even took a little road tour of downtown. Public Square, Gund Arena, Tower City Center, Jacobs field, and the BP building. I never did find out what the name of the tallest building in Cleveland, the one immediately North of the BP building, was. Hmm, gotta find out. Anyway, Fat Fish Blue was just how I remember it. Fun, relaxing, and tasty. I got a souvenir glass with my root beer float, just for good time's sake. And of course I ordered my usual fried green tomatoes and watermelon-cucumber pan seared salmon. It was DELISH. And we finished off with a Carpetbagger. This dessert that looks like a chocolate paper bag, and is filled with fruit and mousse and cake. MMMM MMMMMM. Its definitely still my favorite restaurant in the city of Cleveland. In addition to the great food and fun silverware toys (we named all the toys: Janet, Red, Spike, Charlie, Tiny, Slim, and Ugly), the thing that made this particular night memorable was seeing all my friends at once. Soums, Sahar, Aaron T, Aaron T's girlfriend Zaynab, and his brother Dan, were all there. And in addition of course, my newer friends Aaron K and Scott.    Having Soums, Sahar, and Aaron T in the same place again was wonderful. It was back to talking about Pakistan and China and world religions and all the dreams we have, or had, our families, our other friends... It was just nice to be back home again. The only thing missing was a certain Tamina we all once knew. I missed her a lot more than usual that night. I can't believe it's been almost three years since she died. It makes me really reevaluate what I've done with those three years. Did I spend them right, did I do enough? I guess I'll see as I go.  On a more positive note, I really liked Zaynab. I think she's really good for my Aaron T. I can't wait to see where things go with them. Hopefully all good things. So, after Fat Fish Blue, we went to Pick Wick's Martini Bar, where I had my very first virgin martini. I asked for a diet coke too, and the lady said "Doublefisting tonight?" That was probably the funniest thing I heard all night, next to Soumya's "I was praying to all the Indian gods before that ride, and there's a lot of them!" After our drinks, the night was over and it was time to go home. It was so hard to tear myself away from everyone, especially Aaron T, because I know he's moving back to China again soon, so I probably won't see him for a long time. Somehow we all said our goodbyes, probably til next year, and Scott, Aaron K, and I hit the road.   I drove from 12:30 to 3:00 in the morning. I never believed that you could actually fall asleep at the wheel until I felt it last night. The blankness of the road, the way you focus on the painted lines, the way the view never changes from "just dark"... its overwhelmingly soporific. Aaron was a doll about it though. He stayed up and talked with me the whole time, about some really mundane stuff too, I think, and kept the radio going strong. THANKS AARON! :)     And to seal off the evening, let's just say Vanessa Carlton's song "A Thousand Miles" came on the radio, and Aaron and I sang it all the way home ala White Chicks. (And from the backseat, a rudely awakened Scott goes..."OH GOD NO!")   The perfect end to a perfect weekend.

      Wouldn't ya know it the maintenance man was up on my roof this whole time fixing my damn AC. So the second I submitted that post, he shows up at my door, "Yeah we're done."   LIFE IS PERFECT. Now I don't think I'll ever get outta here...

      My air conditioning has been broken since Monday and its still not fixed. Apparently the whole thing needs replaced. This was discovered yesterday, after the maintenance man poked around in my apartment, and then up on the roof, for a good two hours. He said he'd have the new one put in this morning, but then the bastard didn't show up! Now the leasing office is hunting his ass down for me. I WANT AIR CONDITIONING! I went to visit Anupam's new place the other day and I paid no attention to his fabulous decor. He was asking me what kind of rug to get for the living room and I was like "Ooooh yeeeeeah baby" cuz I was too busy slathering myself in the pure goodness of his air conditioning. I have two fans going right now. Its not enough. I can only hang out in my bedroom, so now all eating and studying operations have been moved to this little itty bitty room that the fan can actually cool. And the cat is PSYCHO. You know how they say heat affects amygdala functioning? Like, when someone's hotheaded and angry, they might actually be feeling hot? OK... I'll find a link for that later. Its hot in here and I'm pissed. In any case, my cat has been excessively vicious lately, with the claws and the teeth. Kitten teeth are nasty, man. And she zips around here like she's gonna find the air conditioning around any corner. QUIT IT ROXY, IT AINT HAPPENIN. Well at least none of the furniture's melted, yet. It is now 80 degrees Fahrenheit in my apartment. I gotta get outta here...

      I TA'd BIOL 211 and 214 at CWRU during my junior and senior years. Recently, one of my former students and also good friend, Yasi, had these up on her away message and my inner dork just couldn't resist. Now THIS is how molecular biology oughta be taught. Isn't it cuuuute?  PRIMER TO TEMPLATE: "HEY BABY DOES THAT POLYMERASE GO ALL THE WAY"   RNA POLYMERASE: "C'MON BABY LET'S KEEP GOING"  mRNA: "I TOLD YOU UAA MEANS UAA!!!"   A-HELIX: "HEY BABY WANT TO ANNEAL?"  B-HELIX: "GET LOST! I TOLD YOU I DON'T TURN THAT WAY!!"  DNA STRAND 1: "HEY BABY WANT TO LIGATE? OUR STICKY ENDS WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER"  DNA STRAND 2: "KEEP YOUR STICKY END TO YOURSELF OR THE NEXT LIGATION YOU PERFORM WILL BE BLUNT ENDED!"

      I was flipping channels a few days ago and ran into the following commercial.   Its for the local oldies station. People are singing along to their favorite oldies songs and completely butchering the lyrics. My favorite guy is singing in the shower to "Sugar Fried Honey Butts" (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch).  Do try this at home: Sing that song, with the new lyrics, at the top of your lungs like I did.  And just TRY not to laugh.

      I spent so much money today. Talk about falling victim to the commercial beast! I went to Bath and Body Works, the Limited, American Eagle, Victoria's Secret (Semi Annual Sale again baby!), Banana Republic, and Lazarus (store closing sale, yay!). It was all I could do to tear myself away from Express, Forever 21 and Kaufmanns. And now that I've said all that, I'm thinking, damn, my life belongs in a teen mag.   All personal greed aside, I did do a very good deed today. My friend Kat and I made an unbeatable care package for our dear friend Crystan who is serving overseas in Tikrit. We know the "new" military Crystan has to be professional and official and stuff, but deep down we know she has a thing for all items neon, toe socks, and coloring books. So of course we're sending them over. I wish I could see the customs officials when they scan our package to find Dunkaroos, Goldfish crackers, Crayola Markers, and a set of pink pajamas. And of course, an Elmo coloring book. Its not the typical cigs and beer care package one might expect. I can't wait to hear if she got it! Kat and I totally agreed that its more fun buying gifts for friends than shopping for yourself. The reward is in the thought.  And finally, as we shopped for a card for Crystan (Ultimately settling on two: "Friends Forever ... In any kind of weather" and "All I wish for are 1) World Peace and 2) You to come back.... But I can do without world peace."), I ran into the following card. Enjoy!  Outside: Girlfriend, we're at an age where if the gynecologist says "You have acute vaginitis." Inside: "We say THANKS!"  I thot it was mighty cute. Cute enough for a vaginitis. Aight thats it for tonight. Time to rack my brains. THANKS Y'ALL!

      It all started when one of my friends arrived at my apartment in tears cuz she got a speeding ticket. We consoled her best we could and it was then that we knew: we were in for an interesting night.  The drama began when we realized that three separate and very different people had invited us out for fireworks. After a half hour of discussing the matter and coming to no conclusion, we decided to discuss it over a sushi dinner.  Restaurant Japan is my favorite sushi venue in Columbus. I initially found out about it on a date with someone I bought at a date auction (go figure). We ordered the Caterpillar roll, Idaho roll, Tokyo roll, and Spider roll. As well as two pieces of Nigiri: fresh salmon and big sweet shrimp (with "fried head"). It was a lot of fun looking sushi actually, and tasted awesome (almost competing with Sushi Samba in Chicago, the most expensive sushi dinner I've ever had). We took pictures of the fried head battling it out with the Caterpillar head over a bed of wasabi. Ruthie tried her first piece of sushi (Idaho roll, a veggie roll) and she loved it! I love introducing people to sushi. I got my sisters started, my dad, Aaron, and now Ruthie. In any case, after dinner we still didn't know exactly what our plans were, so we decided to do that on the drive to Oren's for his barbecue.  On the drive we decided that after the barbecue we'd likely be with Oren's crew so it would be easier to just go with them, so that's what we did. Cancelling on two of my dearest friends though, was not easy. I hate cancelling on people, and I hate cancellations myself. Two phone calls later, and we three ladies were in the clear. We could only hope that the barbecue would be a blast.  After parking the car, all we could smell was vomit. That's always a good sign huh. It was a rooftop party, so if the barf was making it to the ground, then someone up there must be having fun, right? We worked our way to the top floor apartment and Oren showed us the way to the roof. A ten foot ladder fom Lowes, pointed through the access door. I hate things that shake when I'm climbing them. It was so nervewracking climbing that thing, in a skirt for that matter. Eeew. Sorry down below!   We talked on the roof for a good hour and a half, all of us non-drinker ladies with our diet vanilla cokes. It was then that I realized for the first time that Oren was not a law student! I don't know exactly how that one got by me, but we cleared it up fast. Getting fifteen people to the fireworks after that was a complicated venture. After calling cabs that never came, we ended up setting out with one car (mine) and the rest on foot!   Ruthie, Kat, Scott, Quincy (Oren's friend) and I ended up seeing the fireworks together really close to the bridge off Marconi. We were next to a radio that was playing the fireworks music, and we had an AMAZING view. Those were by far the most spectacular fireworks I have ever seen in my whole life! As Ruthie and I discussed, it was like your own personal fireworks show. My favorite part was Louis Armstrong's "Its a Wonderful World" segment. They had fireworks go up for each color mentioned in the song ("trees of green" "red roses"). Its one of my favorite songs! Props to the Red White and Boom coordinators.  After that we hit up Brothers and danced to music none of us have heard since junior high. I mean, who ever listens to Rumpshaker anymore? Kat and Ruthie and I cut out a little early and drove home. In the car they spent a half hour trying to convince me that I was dating someone (seeing them, to be more specific) without realizing it. First of all, is that even possible? If I don't see it as dating then it's not dating right? In any case, I'm soooo terrible with mixed signals. I've gotten in big trouble with that before. Now I'm a little confused, because its not someone I'm all that interested in, and nothing has been made very clear. But they are two of my dearest gal pals, and I gotta give them some credit for the investigative work. So I told them that I just broke up with him. Cuz after all, if he never informed me that we were seeing eachother, I don't have to inform him that I'm ending it. Anyway, altogether it definitely turned out to be the interesting night we though it'd be.  To conclude, the following is an email I received from the coordinator of my MD PhD program. When I interviewed for the program a year ago, I was dubbed "A firecracker" by the director. Since then, the name has stuck. Here's the email. Its not hilarious, but its amusing. I thought it was cute that she remembered.    My little firecracker,   Please beware of strange firecrackers.  Stick to sparklers...   Ashley

      So I had an epiphany today about how many great guy friends I have in my life. I'd say most of my friends are guys. I kinda think that I turn into a completely different person around girls. I have to care about stuff like nailpolish and clothes, which I do care about, but not that much. But around guys I can generally be myself, and just, well, not care! And we all have these great no stress relationships that have lasted years in some cases. So I wanted to write something about them. So here it is, for all of you...  The Poem for My Boy Friends.  The sister he never had Always wished for her The brother she'll always miss Still needs him Inseparable teammates  Choose your own adventure (No let me) Make me laugh (With you) Look at those smiles  (Radiate)  Taking life and what it hands them Never too seriously Screaming F U to circumstance Choosing to live, no, LIVE Companions going on, anyway  That is timeless friendship, Brothers and sisters of the world. That is love.

      And among other random thots, I really want to go dancing sometime soon. Donny made me a new rap CD that has some excellent beats on it and I'm completely addicted to it now! I woke up this morning, and first thing I did was pop in that CD. And then it has to travel with my to my car and to my lab and back again. This is truly insane. I gotta get it out of my system. I hear people are going out to the clubs next week, and I am going to try to hold out. After all I have a test around then to take care of. But until then, I'll be the one dancing in my apartment with my cat, dancing in my lab when everyone leaves, and dancing in my car as I drive down 315. have YOU seen Columbus's very own psycho dancy lady? Ok I'm out.

      I've been watching a shitload of movies lately. I think half of last month's paycheck went to rent and the rest went to movies. Fullprice movies at the theater, with a student discount of course. And wouldn't ya know it, prices went up 50 cents a flick just in time for my binge. So I thot about it and I figured the best thing to do is offer my own movie ratings for every show I saw. These ratings have nothing to do with professional ratings, but they are probably more reliable.  A+ Shrek 2 (first time) (Puss in Boots is unbelievably cute) A- Shrek 2 (second time)  A- Troy (up from a B+ b/c of Brad's beautiful butt!)  B- The Day After Tomorrow (I'm freeezing to death!) A- Saved! (God loves you, even if you are a fuckup) B+ White Chicks (Nicois salad, nuff said) A  Fahrenheit 9/11 (Admittedly biased, but mostly true. Strong argument) C+ Dodgeball (No one should have to see man-tits do that)  And for the hell of it: A  Zoolander (rent) (ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCINO! thats all) A+++ Family Guy - Season Three (rent) (Da Boom, Brian in Love, Death is a Bitch, etc)  Left on my list are: Mean Girls Spiderman 2 Harry Potter 3 The Stepford Wives The Terminal Harold and Kumar go to White Castle  And on a highly relevant side note, I absolutely gotta get Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 of The Family Guy. I LOVE that show with a passion like none other. Beautiful men and caramel fudge brownie ice cream can hardly compete. It is quite nearly the love of my life.   And I'll love you too if you support my mission to acquire it. Hint hint.  Oh I'm sooooo subtle.

      Well, the test is over, med 1 is over, the initial celebration with Dave and Buster's, a foam party, and the State Fair are over.  SO today I flew to New York City. Let me tell ya, its already been a great day.  My flight was delayed an hour and a half from Columbus, but the time went by fast as I read Jhumpa Lahiri's book "Interpreter of Maladies." I know, I know, I'm the last person to jump on that bandwagon and she's already out with another Pulitzer winning book, "The Namesake." Nevertheless I enjoyed reading  for pleasure  again. I also really like how she addresses the stories of immigrants, expatriates, and first generation Indian-Americans alike. Every story I've read today has had some connection to a personal story in my life. Definitely a must read.  Reading that book got me to the city by 3:30. My uncle picked me up from the airport. Betcha didn't know he's a cab driver! It was nice to catch a cab and pay no fare. It would have been nearly $30 to Long Island City where my old friend Nina lives. Thanks "Belal Mama."  Nina and I have both changed dramatically. I still remember how punk she was in high school, and how traditional conservative I was in college. None of that tonight though. We spent the afternoon catching up, and then went to Union Square in Manhattan. Union Square by the way is just a few blocks from the Empire State Bldg. Armed with our credit cards and a willingness to spend freely, we attacked Virgin Records, Aerosoles (I now own the sexiest pair of black patent stilletos the world has ever seen), Victoria's Secret, Sephora (yay, new makeup!), and Express ($20 off jeans!). We also visited a random street fair where I got a strawberry crepe. I love food vendors. Finally, we met up with Nina's boyf Nathan at this little Thai restaurant in the Village called Spice. Dinner was faaaantabulous.  After that Nina and Nathan and I returned to Nina's pimped out apartment (I swear I've never seen a more sophisticated place to live, that looks so deceivingly ghetto on the outside!). It was time to get sexified!! I totally broke out the new shoes, and Nina and I shared our new makeup. Her other friends Beryl and Ebone came over to go out and we all sat around and talked for a while. Ebone had an incident with a bad bottle of orange Zima while we waited for Nina to get glammed up.  Beryl drove us to Manhattan in his 89 Cadillac Deville. I thought I was going to die in that car, it was soooo scary. I still can't believe I braved and survived New York driving last summer!! Despite the driving madness, we eventually arrived at the club. At 2 AM! In Columbus that would be when last call is made, but uh uh, not in New York! Judging by the attendance at that club, with its 10,000 sq ft dance floor, I was sure that the city really never sleeps!  The club we went to was called Spirit, and it came with an all-night spa built inside! We danced too long to get massages though, they were closed :( . And as you can see by the time, the Red Bull and Diet Coke have not worn off. Beryl and Nathan and Nina and I are all still up. The night is not over yet...;P  More as convenient computer access arises. Shout outs to everyone from the Big Apple!

      I went to my second Ohio State Fair today with Aaron and Donny. Considering I've lived in the great state of Ohio since the day I was born, it is kind of disappointing that this is only the second time I've hit the big fair. No worries though, as was last year, it was a lot of food, fun, and animals. The Clydesdale horses were still my favorite part of the fair. They are such majestic animals. Whenever I get married I want my groom to arrive on one of those! So yes, in addition to that there were chickens and ducks and sheep and pigs and dairy cattle and beef cattle. A regular petting zoo out there. I didn't pet any of them though, because I was too busy gnawing on a corn dog, cheese on a stick, and a DEEP FRIEND TWINKIE. I am sure, absolutely sure, that I am going to die three years prior to plan now. And we also hit up a few rides, the classic ferris wheel, the Crazy Mouse carny rollercoaster, and the Magic Carpet ride three story slide. If the Deep Fried Twinkie wasn't going to kill me, the Crazy Mouse surely was. I think the best part of the whole fair though was being part of the parade. That's right. We weren't planning to be part of the parade, but as we watched we saw an oldschool fire truck at the end of the parade with a little ledge on the back. And it was moving kinda slowly at the end of the parade queue... so we just hopped on the back and started waving to people! I think the consensus was that we were giving young people a bad name ;) , but whatever. Hence, Donny, Aaron and I were part of the parade at the Ohio State Fair this year. You betta believe it.  Finally, I got my handwriting analyzed. Well, not really. I got a fake-o printout of what my handwriting says about me. Read it, and try to tell me it doesn't somewhat describe you too.  Personality is SO very ambiguous. After all what is it but an attempt to oversimplify the human condition. Anyway, here it is:   You have an extraordinary sense of humor but it is also unusual and not always fully understood. You have a provocative nature that could cause problems with those of the opposite sex. Your fear of rejection is greater than your fear of success.  (WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?)   You are naturally dominate but you can be led by the right person. You sometimes talk when you should be listening. Your charm and personality have won you many friends. Among people you know, you enjoy being the center of attention. You enjoy the challenge of a good contest or game.    All for now. I got SO much to do before I leave tomorrow. This *might* be my last blog for a while. Take care all.

      Its a little early yet, I know, but is anyone else excited for the Olympics?! As long as I remember I've been a huge Olympics fan for some reason, even though I'm not as into any other sport besides football. My favorite part of the games of course is the opening ceremony. I just LOVE seeing all the different countries and their native costumes and flags. Wow. I stand in awe of diversity, as always.

      FREEDOM. From school, from books, from all things medicine. I feel SOOO good right now. The shelf boards are over, which means first year is over, which means I can comfortably start my summer break now...for the next ten days! Its definitely a short vacation but I'm planning to live it up.  Today started things off well. I went to Rally for the Ramp (the new exit ramp to OSU off 315) right after the test and checked out some cute construction barrels dressed as OSU cheerleaders and hospital patients. Yes, I said dressed. I've never explored an exit ramp on foot before, so for the short time I was there, it was worth it. The afternoon was spent running several errands that I've been putting off, including turning in my biostats homework and dropping off dry cleaning, among others. And then I hit the mall. I really enjoy shopping at the mall on my own. Its fun with friends as well, but then I rarely am as productive or scrutinizing a shopper as when I go on my own. So I did spend a good hunk of change today, but I'm proud to say I did not dip into the vacation budget. I'll address that in a minute. The rest of the day was really relaxing. I worked out and went to a barbecue at Tendy's condo. Then I went to Dave and Buster's for the Ruthann/Aaron/Sanjida one-year anniversary celebration. From there we grabbed Donny and went to Long Street. It has been SOO long since I've gone out dancing. Tonight was a lot of fun though. They were having a foam party!! I'd never been to one of those before, so of course I grabbed Donny and we dove right in. It was pretty amazing how much foam they made out of these barrels, and it was sooo much fun to fight with. We all got soaked. And of course in the meantime there was some good music to dance to. Altogether, though I took three showers in one day (morning, workout, and post-foam), it was a fun evening. And I'm so clean you could eat off me. ;)  So anyway, the vacation I referred to earlier? 8 days 7 nights in New York City (including 2 days and 1 night in Philly). AWWWW YEEEAH BABY. I cannot WAIT to get outta this city and see people who have nothing to do with school or research or medicine. Altogether I'll be seeing Nina, Raquib, my mom's sister and my cousins, Rohini (YAY!! she's spending half the week with me), my dad's sister and those cousins, Shareef, and of course Aaron and Nate. Its amazing that I'm going to see Aaron on this trip. We practically have the same brain as it is, and the one time we take vacations from school that are not school-related we still wind up in the same place. Ah the irony. I am sure it will be a lot of fun. So anyway, I'm superexcited to see all these friends and relatives, and of course to spend time exploring the city with Ro. I've been to New York several times before, but as anyone who's been there knows, there's always more to see and do out there. And exploring is always so much more fun with someone else who shares your brain (Rohini and I ALSO have the same brain). :)  As for how I did on the exam, a few people have asked, I won't know my scores for a while but the three exam sections were definitely not easy. I did my best though so its out of mind for the moment. Becky's right though, I have a definite history of not giving myself enough credit when its due. The biochem section actually did turn out to be my favorite section. Yeah baby, my degree was worth something after all!  Well thats all for the evening. This is the latest I've been up in ages! Gnight!

       "When I investigate and when I discover that the forces of the heavens and the planets are within ourselves, then truly I seem to be living among the gods." ~ Leon Battista Alberti   I have been preparing nonstop for the past six days for the USMLE shelf board exam. You may recall it as the exam that left me crying a few days ago. Luckily I haven't shed a tear since. I've survived at Cup O Joe, Borders, and the ISP library from 8 am to nearly 11 pm every day. I had only a cell phone and this blog to maintain contact with the outside, living world. I listen to Los Lonely Boys and Modest Mouse every day in my car as a reward, and I even took tonight off to chill at North Market and Ben and Jerry's with some friends. Right now as I revel in my last moments pre-exam, I feel like my head is the size of the Hindenberg, dangerously full of information, and its going to explode over the next two days, spilling random medical factoids all over Columbus. Watch out dear city. I've never taken a two day test before.  It sounds exhausting. I guess it will be kind of like a finals week. Its been a long time since I had one of those. I don't recall having an exam this stressful since the MCATs. Although, I was one of the anti-premeds back at CWRU (most people didn't even know I was) and didn't really prepare for the MCAT at all. In fact the week before the test I was spending my days in Reslife training and moving into my new room. Given that experience, and where it got me, I guess I really shouldn't worry. I know my stuff and its just a matter of trusting myself when I have a good first answer. That is SO much easier to say than to do. Why is it that its so much easier for my friends and family to have faith in me than for me to have faith in myself? I haven't decided if I will study tomorrow or not. I'll see how burnt out I am after the second test. Upon speaking with the brown crown rumor mill, I've been told that this test has a way of making you feel like a dumb shit, no matter how hard you prepared, no matter how well you actually did. Knowing this in advance is somewhat comforting, because I know that I won't be the only one feeling like a medical admissions error.   All in all, I don't know what to make of this whole exam or how I'll do, but at this point in time I feel good about it and I'm looking forward to ending the madness Thursday. For now, I guess I just gotta go with whatever's in my head and in my gut and call it a day. Or two. Time for some cerebral fuel (sleep). Gnight!

      I never cry. When bad things happen I'm the rock for everyone else. Yes, when someone dies, I cry, but even then, its often behind closed doors. Very few people outside of my immediate family have ever seen me cry. Recently, as you know, I was scared shitless doing things like riding Top Thrill Dragster and jumping out of planes, but still, even cheating death, I didn't cry.  Today I cried in public. I don't know what came over me. I have been studying madly for this shelf board exam (think of it as a year end cumulative) that is coming up in a couple days. I know my stuff, more or less, but the review is a grueling process. So, my dad calls me this morning as I was studying at Cup O Joe, and as soon as he said "How are you?" IT ALL CAME OUT. I didn't bawl or nothin. But the tears, they flowed. In the coffeeshop! I hated medschool and I hated not knowing things and I hated the stress of having to get a 62% or above to stay in the game. It was all irrational and pointless, but it felt SOOO good to let it out, and so uncomfortable that people were there. My dad was understanding about it though, having been through the spiel himself. He told me to remember my past successes and that hey, I have a degree in Biochemistry so I shouldn't worry about that section. Oy vay. CWRU taught me a lot of details about Biochemistry, but they did a great job of ignoring some fundamentals. Anyway, so I feel a lot better now. Still focused and still gunning. Just wanted to share my moment with y'all.  Now its time to break out the sushi with my favorite Bash.
