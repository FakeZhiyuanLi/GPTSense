      Jia Wei lost her match against the Korean. I may sound biased here but I feel that the Korean had very bad court etiquette. What was her name? Oh Kim Kyung Ah (or something like that). I started crying after she lost her match. I was crying for how far she had come, only to fall short at the last hurdle. I'm sure many Singaporeans felt the same. Today's papers showed Jia Wei crying when she told PM Lee that she had lost the match and that she was sorry she could not give Singapore her medal. PM Lee told her, however, that sports isn't just about medals. It's about trying again and again, never to give up. *applauds* I really felt for her then. I knew she was visibly upset when she played that match. Her eyes showed no determination at all. They showed tiredness. She had given up. However, she stood tall as an Olympian, never breaking till she left the court. That was when she started to cry. Poor girl. What ticked me off was that some idiot on the Team Singapore forum said that Jia Wei was not fit to be Singaporean. Who is he to criticise her? Has he done ANYTHING for Singapore? If he hasn't, he ought to shut up. His command of English by the way, leaves much to be desired. I, of course, flamed him back with a string of civilised degrading words in perfect English. Many others did too of course. We wouldn't let him bully Jia Wei like that. She's already so upset. It wouldn't do to make her even more upset. It would affect her mentally.  She, the Table Tennis team, Lee Wung Yew (shooter) and Stanley Tan (sailor) are coming back next Tuesday, 31st August at 5.50am. Oh my god!! That's so early! I wanted to go there with Meixi to welcome them home. Looks like my hopes are dashed. Kerry's quite sure she's going though. I've made her promise me to get an autograph and if possible, for me to talk to Jia Wei on the phone for awhile to tell her what I want to say. Jia Wei, you've done VERY VERY WELL as an Olympian. Being able to finish 4th in the world is NO MEAN FEAT for a citizen of this Lilliputian dot of a nation. =) I'm so proud of you! I am an athlete myself and have tasted different degrees of success and failure. I understand how you feel. The media has put immense pressure on you to do well. I think that was so wrong of them. They shouldn't have done that. They know well that Singaporeans would rally behind you. Did you know Orchard Road was apparently empty yesterday because everyone was at home watching and supporting you? We're ONE SINGAPORE!! Don't worry, you're still young and you HAVE the potential to be an Olympic Medallist. I know it'll happen. God will make it happen. When God closes a door, somewhere he opens a window. He closed the door on you yesterday but he opened a window somewhere else. Look for that window and take in the sunshine girl. Singapore loves you, you're a Gold Medallist in our hearts. Fret not, we're behind you all the way!! Jia you!!  On to school matters, had an average day. Just finished my PW report, which is pretty short on my part. Ava wrote further in my notebook her thoughts and feelings. At least TPs are still talking to her. They aren't talking to me much now cuz I mix around with LC. What the H. E. double L. Is it a crime to mix with her? Some people are so insensitive sometimes. Well, you can't blame them. One of them came from a SAP school and didn't know about other races till she entered JC. What a shame. Out of them, she's probably the most cutting of them. Singapore could do away with people like her. Ava's going to get a doodle book for us. We're naming it the Burn Book (after the movie). It'll contain all our memories of JC life. Can't wait for it.  I'm off to sleep now. It's 12.45am. Sigh...my life sucks. I miss you Clay. LoL...yea, Clay...Clay Aiken!  Song: Home 2004 - Young Voices (I'm feeling particularly patriotic tonight after flaming that moronic idiot on the forum in perfect English. Bwah!)

      I had a good swim today. Woohoo! Found out that I could pull very well when the pool was pretty shallow but I slowed down considerably in the middle section of the pool, which was 1.8m deep. Why? Someone enlighten me. Swum continuously for about 1/2 hr to 45mins till Mum came to call me up. I went in to have a thorough shower and then went up to the bowling alley to join Mum and Dad. Saw Keith Toh there. That guy who looks like a poly student but who actually is only 15. From ACS I think, from what I could gather from his t-shirt. Dad gave me money to have a hot cup of milo but I couldn't find the lady manning the counter so Mum said to have my milo when we reach Sun Plaza, which was around 5-10mins drive away. They went off on the 1st floor to go to Goldheart (Mum's a jewellery fan ^_^) while I stopped at the 3rd. I asked for a cup of milo and told the lady not to add so much hot water. She told her counterpart to add half hot and half cold water. Paid 90c and sat down to enjoy my drink.  Joined Mum and Dad at Goldheart after finishing my milo. She was looking at a 0.6 carat ring. I spent time examining the diamonds whilst comparing them with the chart which dictated clarity, cut and what not. One of the staff suggested I become a Gemologist (sp?) haha. Mum bought 1 ring and 1 pair of ear rings and we left to go home.  On the way home, we heard on radio that Jia Wei lost her semi-final match to that Korean what's her name. I was so upset I wanted to cry. I knew I shouldn't have placed high hopes on her but it just seemed so odd that her winning streak was broken. Watched the last game of the match during the repeat just now. It's ok though, she still has a shot at the bronze. I really hope she gets it. I think she's feeling crushed now. She knew that Singapore would be watching and she didn't want to disappoint. It's ok Jia Wei, you've done your best. You shouldn't have any regrets! Think about it, you kicked the Korean's butt 11-0 during one of the games. W.H.O.A! You still have a shot at a medal tomorrow, the bronze. Though it's not as glamorous as a silver or gold, it's still an OLYMPIC MEDAL. Not many athletes in the world even get to GO to the Games and even less win medals. It's going to be a great honour to win even a bronze. GO JIA WEI!!! I'm behind you!!! Jia you!!!  Oh yes, also got a new mouse. Figured out why my computer was crashing on me. It wasn't blogspot hah! Although I thought it was initially, but it was actually my mouse. It suddenly died and my brother threw it away. He installed the extra mouse in the house, which was so tiny it couldn't fit into the palm of MY hand. Imagine that. My hand's already the tiniest in the house. It's quite insensitive too so I'm glad I have my new mouse now. *muacks the new mouse* It's the same as the old one but it's black instead of white.  Oh well, I need to get back to my work. Sigh...I still have Assignment 12 (Techniques of Differentiation) and 4 36ji to do. Someone just kill me now.  The only bright thing of tomorrow is that we're going to try out the new Ebonite/Hammer balls. Hope I can find a really good ball haha. I've been plagued with so many problems with my current ball. Wrong ball for me. Mum was really angry Uncle Kenneth recommended me the ball. Was he trying to clear stock and thus used me as a guinea pig? =( Well, Uncle Fong's going to be there when we drill that ball so Uncle Kenneth can't screw up this time. Uncle Fong might wring his neck heeh. Training went ok today. Learnt some new stuff. Too lazy to type it here. However, only 8 people came. Andrew Yeong's apparently training with the National Youth Squad. Sounds so incredulous. Oh wells, good luck anyway. He hasn't been coming for training. Ren Yih and me are going to leave him OUT of next year's National Schools' team if he doesn't want to attend any of the trainings, no matter how good he is. I don't care. We've decided to leave the names of those who haven't been attending trainings for next year's squad.  Sigh...I hope life becomes better for me. Urgh, I'm gonna get back my common test papers on Monday. Can't stand it. I know I'll fail all. Urgh...I'll just have to work harder for the promos. I don't wanna be retained. I don't care if the TPs do. I wouldn't mind AT ALL. See how much they've offended me?  Song (I'll put this everyday if I don't forget.

      I'm in such a bad mood today. I don't even know why. My computer's crashing on me. Argh...! TPs are bothering me so much today. I can't stand them argh. I don't even know why. I think it's because Ava talked to me about them. She wrote them down in my notebook that she was miserable in Singapore. Poor thing. I much prefer my first 3 months class. We had no cliches, no one badmouthed each other, we were all very pally with one another. Why can't it be like that?! I know it's wrong to badmouth people but I can't help it. They've messed up my once-enjoyable life in JC. I miss my old friends, Jia Lin and Chii Boon. Boon's gone on to SAJC and is apparently unable to cope with the triple science course. Good luck my friend. You can do it! Jia Lin...we're still very pally cuz we're in the same school but different classes.  I failed my chinese. 40/100 but I'm quite happy cuz I improved from 21/100 lol. =) However, I'm just wee disappointed I failed maths. Ms Ho said I failed by only a couple of marks. Sigh...the results of last minute study. I hope I can do well enough in the promos to be promoted. It's going to be such a shame to myself and my parents if I get retained. I mean, my family are all so scholarly like and it's bothered me for so many years. My cousins all seem to outdo me. ALL.THE.TIME. I'm just so mad at myself. Though my parents say they don't care, just do my best, I know they care. They want to see me on top for once. I want to do it but I just can't. It's not in my means to do so. Look at Yi Lang, he's already in Uni. Stanford Uni at that. And he's only a year older than me. My brother was one of the top students in his school and was awarded numerous gold medals and awards. You can see how happy my parents, especially my dad was. I sometimes wish I could be like that. I've imagined it before but I'll never get there. Cheryl got 8 pts for her Os and what did I get? 8 PLUS 10 and was promptly kicked out of JC and posted to PJC. Luckily I was an OGL and could appeal back. Life was pretty ok in Term 2. I did ok in my common tests. I got an A for maths, scraped through Bio but I failed Physics. Ok, I was expecting to fail Physics anyway. I miss Mr Foo so much. I wish he could come back to teach us! Sigh...we got rid of our previous maths teacher, Mr Lee and got a new one, Ms Ho. She's nice. I like her. =) I think it's kinda important that teachers be around our age and not too old otherwise the generation gap will result in communication breakdown. Just like my physics tutor. He just can't connect with the class. I don't know why, I can't stand him. When you don't like a teacher, you won't do well for that subject. I really wanna do ok for physics, AT LEAST pass but I can't. I think I'll slide even further down than 47/110 for this time's common test. Argh.  Well, I'm going swimming at Yishun later. My first time in the pool this year. Can't wait but I'm gonna be all alone. That's alright I guess. I always have my imagination to keep me company. There's Bowling training later. Sigh...I just can't get the whole team to come for at least one training. Since Ren Yih and me assumed the posts of Captain, the whole team has NEVER been at training. Attendance was not full. I don't know what to do man. Seriously. What must our seniors be thinking? We promised not to let them down. We can't let the club be shut down. I would cry. Why must my life be so shitty?  Li Jia Wei's gonna be playing in the 2004 Athens Olympics Table Tennis Semi-Final later. I wish her all the best and I hope she can bring glory to Singapore. I just don't like the media hype cuz I think it pressurises the athletes. Poor Ronald. I hope he's ok. I could tell he was feeling so crushed when he lost to Boonsak (whatever his name is) of Thailand. He knew that our hopes were on him and he, perhaps, could not handle the pressure. Impacts of Media...sigh.  Jia Wei, don't let whatever the media says bother you. Just go in and play your own game. You CAN beat them all. All the best girl!!! Kick butt! Singapore's behind you!!!
