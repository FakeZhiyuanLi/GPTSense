       Heyy!! Well 2dayy was the first dayy of skool… :)Yeah, I had to wake up early and stuff so I was really pissed off.. buh then I saw ‘enid’ and gave her a big hug and so then i was happy… we were starin’ at the freshman actin like they’re “The $h!t” now jusS cuz they’re in high school with their cell phones and stuff (lol), this is not gonna be funn with freshmen! It was so0o much better with just us ppl. PLUS I saw Patty my other super close friend and I gave her the fricCen biggest hugg of life! And it was her b-day.. so yeah… I went to homeroom and I had   MR. BROWN !!!!!  YeY!! I luv that guy.. he’s an asshole, but super funny and his class is like THE BEST! last yr. we could talk about ANYTHING! we even talked about strippers and adult video stores.. ((lol)) he so str8! so I was happy.. and "Lisi" and "Alely" were in my class.. so that was good.Then came 1st period, fricCen math !! uggh! I was hopin’ I knew sum-1, then when I walked in the class I had “JORGE” I was so happy!! My lil bestest buddy.. and I also had “gil” and Orlando.. jorges friend. Buh then the stupid biAtch of a teacher sat us alphabetically, me and gil were faaaaaar away since he’s “B”.. Jorge is “R” and I’m “T” so we weren’t far but not close enough to talk :( that sux.. and I met 2 girls there, umm.. “Steaphanie” and I dun remember the other girls name (lol).. but they were both st8.. umm.. 2nd period.. Journalism A.k.A *.:yearbook staff/newspaper crew:.* there I had "Patricia" "Angel" "Kevin" "Laur!!!" "Jeffery" and 2 girls I met “Zuhly” and “Elsy”. Teacher: mrs. Burger.. super nice! 3rd period..   MR.BROWN   again !!! (lmao) lucky me! I get him for homeroom AND English! :) :) :) hehe! that class is so easy! and so0o much funn !! I had “Lisi” “Jessy” “Richelle” “Jessy” "the beautiful 'Brandon' nxt, 4th..science, Mrs. Welch... I hadd that teacher in 8th grade and she was prRty nice buh I guess she changed cuz she was like not really that nice (lol) and she made us sit alphabetically!!! ahhh!! I hate that so0o0o mucho!! So any ways there I hadd “Jorge” again.. “James” and “Danielle!!!” :) YeY!! *2 danielle: wo0t! bakk 2 laughin’ 24-7!!* hah! ..rememberin’ the good times! so umm then was 5th, early childhood education which is a class where you learn about lil kiddys.. and IN SCHOOL theres a daycare.. which is the class, so we are the kiddys pre-school teachers. we write lesson plans, feed them, put them down for their naps, take care of them.. so that’s a lot of funn! And the teacher is gangsta (lol) he’s like super nice and has ear peircings and a piercing on his eye brow.. so he’s cool, and looks funn. Besides Mr. Brown knows him and he says he’s good. well finally came 6th.. I walkin over there then I saw “coach chew” A.k.A. "CHEWY!!!" so I was like HEYYYY! So0o.. i said ‘hi’ and stuff then behind me comes Patty and nearly knocks me down huggin’ me. and we’re talkin, complainin how we didn’t have n*e classes 2gether.. so then I go “o0h wut class do u go 2 nxt?” and she goes “802” and I said me 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and we were so happy.. screamin and laughin (LMAO!!) ahhh! and all the freshmen were lookin at us like we were crazy so Chewy goes “o0h.. u gotta get used to that” (lol) funny! So me and patty went to our class 2gether!! :) :) :) :) :)…. n*e wayzz so..the class was ‘health’ and the teacher was Mrs. Goldman.. weird teacher she is old but sporty…looks dutch or sumthin’ (lol)she reminds me of the dutch dude from "Austin P0wers: Gold Member" lol.. she was tellin us the story of her summer how she went fly fishen in the coast of sum freaky, weird country.. yeah wierd I “think”.. umm there I saw “Alix” “Patricia” "Chris" aaaaand….. I 4got who else.. by that time I hadd a headache and it was all a blurr 2 me (lol) well.. I didn’t have “lissette” for any classes, buh that’s okay cuz I hadd “Jorge”. As long as I hadd one of my homie g’s.. I mean it still sux, I thought I would go crazzy without her in any of my classes buh I didn’t.. she'll prolii go crazzy.. lol cuz she doesn’t have any friends in her class.. not me OR “Jorge” OR anybody!! poor lissette. :( hang in there! only 179 dayyz 2 go!!  Disappointments of the dayy: :( I didn’t get enid in ANY of my classes!! That sux so0o badd shes my home grl ! :( hopefully I get u nxt year!!! ;) andd lunch was HORRIBLE!

So it turned out to be a fricCen family 0uting!! ((lol)) so yeah.. we all went together to see ‘Bourne Supremacy’.. I had lots of fun. but like while we were waitin for the movie to start, I decided to call jorge and tell him the fun hes missin out on… (good idea!) he was like “o0h guess where I am!?” and I said I kno ur at your cuzins house… then he goes “noooo.. im @ dolphin!” and I was like “noooo!! U fricCn liar!!” lol and he stated laughin and said he was @Fridays with his fam.. but that he had to go cuz he was in the bathroom and he had to pee ((lmao)).. soooo when I hung up I told lissette, then we stayed quiet and I go in a kindda spert of the moment thing “wanna go see jorge!?!?” ((lol))… and we ran to Fridays to go see him!
