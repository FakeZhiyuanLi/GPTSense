      i am a librarian.   my hair has never before been long enough for a bun.  it is now,  and as i was too lazy for the blowout routine this morning,  i shlepped it up into a bun  fresh from the shower.   it would seem that i need to do this more often!  i have had a zillion unsolicited "lusty librarian" comments come my way already and while - mostly - this is just creepy,  at long last it seems   i have perfected the bun.

      Everyone is making me tired.  Keeping up with life takes a lot of effort, and sometimes I just want to drop out.  I’m feeling really selfish right now because I really *don’t* have it so bad (although I really do have many work and social obligations that cannot be dismissed) and I think that my life would be really pleasant – if only I had the time to deal with it.  For instance – I’ve recently lost a lot of weight (well, not SO recently – I’ve been working on it since October – and actually, not such a LOT of weight – but enough so that I feel a lot better about myself) and I’m forever frightened that I’ll slip back into my old body.  So I have to work really hard not to let myself do this.  Plus, I’m changing jobs, juggling ridiculous co-workers, keeping up with the domestic responsibilities of living with my slob-of-a-husband, and I just want to  s*c*r*e*a*m !  Everyone feels this way, right?  Can I just drive off into the nothing and lose myself for a little while?  Am I allowed to do that?  I just heard a statistic that 1 in every 100 people are schizophrenic.  There may be some genetic link to this, but it is also thought to have something to do with environmental impact in childhood (and diseases and bugs, etc. you may have had as a kid).  Regardless of the causes, doesn’t that statistic seem high?  I meet a lot of people with mental illness in my line of work, but it still seems really high.  I’m beginning to worry about my own mental state – I seem to at least display one symptom: “assigning unusual significance or meaning to normal events or holding fixed false personal beliefs”.  Because, really – things are just fine.

      So, my reason for creating this blog was not, in fact, to declare my love of earwigs.  I actually don’t even like them very much (with the exception of that whole cerci thing).  I’ve been told that I can be very negative at times.  While I don’t always think this is true, I’d rather not burden my friends with my lamentations.  It’s so nice to be able to express yourself – get it out there – and not have to own up to it.  Doing it secretly is so much more kind.   My first tirade will be about my lack of rational thought.  I am like a child sometimes, wanting instant gratification, and not always thinking things through to the end.  I’ve done this again just recently.  I’ve interviewed for a part-time job and they’ve offered it to me.  Great!  Except now I’m wondering if I can actually afford not to be working full-time.  I should have thought more about this ahead of time, right?  hmmm…

      i've been in a bit of a musical rut lately.&nbsp;  there have been a few good records that deserve some merit, but nothing i've really gotten excited about for a while.&nbsp;  the new lassie foundation/duraluxe split has just changed that.&nbsp;  okay, so not new, really - but new to me. it's lovely!  out on grand theft autumn ( urlLink www.grandtheftautumn.com )&nbsp;the disc&nbsp;is entitled 'Music from the Film: I Duel Sioux & The Ale Of Saturn', and&nbsp;features six new(ish) songs from each band.  i've been a fan of the lassie foundation for some time (trendy as i want to be) and rank them up there with the helio sequence (however,  love and distance  was a bit of a disappointment - what's up with all that harmonica fellas?)  anyway - yum!  perfect summer listening.

      I bought a Metrokane Houdini Corkscrew over the weekend and have fallen in love.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink http://www.epinions.com/pr-Cooking_Tools-Metrokane_Houdini_Corkscrew/display_~reviews &nbsp; &nbsp;  The description says that it works like magic…and it does!&nbsp; I know it is a lot to spend on a corkscrew, but it is absolutely worth it!&nbsp; Especially after having stained one too many shirts using the “stick and shimmy” method of one of those double-pronged-jobbies.&nbsp; Yay!  &nbsp;  I’ve just finished up  Persepolis  by Marjane Satrapi – fantastic, too!&nbsp; &nbsp;   urlLink http://www.randomhouse.com/pantheon/graphicnovels/satrapi2.html    Extreme Simplicity : Homesteading in the City  by Christopher and Dolores Lynn Nyerges wasn’t quite what I was expecting.&nbsp; Actually, I’m not sure it was feasible for me to expect to learn the secrets of homesteading a posh place in the city (wouldn’t that just be squatting?) but this wasn’t it.&nbsp; On the bright side, it does offer some unique ways of making environmentally conscious decisions about city dwelling.

      I wanted a way to keep a running list of what I'm currently reading and re-reading.&nbsp; I'm sure there is a better looking way to do this, but I suppose until I learn how, I'll just list my currents as a new post.&nbsp; (If someone knows how to make those little side-bars, please let me know!) &nbsp; Anyway - I live books.&nbsp; I've got one on my bedside table, one for book-club, one at the gym, one at work, one in the kitchen, heck - even one on tape in my car.&nbsp;  Here goes: &nbsp;  Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  by David Sedaris  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  by Steven Chbosky  Cleanliness is Next to... : Life's Most Essential Cleaning Tasks  by Clarice Taylor  Postcards From No Man's Land  by Aidan Chambers  The Body of Christopher Creed  by Carol Plum-Ucci  Atonement  by Ian McEwan &nbsp; I just finnished  The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things  by JT Leroy.&nbsp; Recommended, but a total bummer. &nbsp;

      tori spelling got married over the weekend. not only did she and her new beau *charge* their guests $1700 to attend their shindig, but they also registered for a bunch of crap.  you can view their registry here:  http://www.tiffany.com/registry/registry_pur.asp?registryID=105453&  just in case you'd like to purchase something for the lovely couple.  i guess it just goes to show you that not even money will buy you taste.

      what is it like to kiss someone for the first time? i knew how it felt once. i've long since forgotten.  what's it like to live in australia? coastlines forever in your view...*sigh*  speaking of which,  coastline  by rachel goswell is the most beautiful song on her new album. it's adult contemporary for the most part, but beautiful just the same.  i'm reading  fortress of solitude  right now. by jonathan lethem. beautiful, too. dylan ebdus. dylan ebdus. dylan ebdus.  i've also just finished  ring  and then  spiral  - both by koji suzuki. is it embarrassing to be looking forward to  loop ? maybe. but, i am.
