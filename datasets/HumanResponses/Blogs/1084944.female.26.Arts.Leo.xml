        Absolutism    There are no absolutes for something so relative as a human life.  -Hugh Prather, Notes to Myself  Funny how it seems true when you read it in a book. When I say, at the age of 40, I want to write a book. When I say I want to be a hair dresser for 2 years. When I say tomorrow I want to meet this person, go this place, finish this much work, wake up at this time, and wear this. So how often have things gone the way I wanted them to? And how often have the results been exactly the way I wanted them to be? And how often, when the result has been the way I wanted it to be, have I been as happy as I thought I would be?   Has it happened to you that you wore this outfit that you never imagined yourself wearing 6 months ago, just because you had nothing better to wear, and got more compliments for it than on a day you meticulously planned your dress code? What are the chances of you making more close friends in 6 months of working than you did in 4 years of graduation? Has someone else's question ever given you answers and shown you realities that were always in your face? How often have things been perfect? When you do come across things that ARE perfect, how often is it that you planned them? Have you ever been bitterly disappointed that perfection was too perfect and lacked spontaneity, and hence, wasn't perfect after all?   So is symmetry perfect? Is asymmetry not beautiful? Isn't the now more important? Aren't mistakes more important than failures? So would you really like a spate of winnings and no losses at all? Is what I dream to be tomorrow, stopping me from being me right now? Is the life I am leading what I want? Am I living or existing? Is it wrong to want to live? For that matter, is it wrong when at times, you want to give up and don't want to live? Is it wrong that you don't want to be strong? But if you are, does that mean you are superior? Does that make you a better person? So who is a good person? If a social worker, who helps unknown people improve their lives, beats up his wife, is he a good person or a bad person? Are you a good person? Are you bad? Are you never bad? Does bad mean wrong? If you are being bad in self defense, is that wrong or correct? Did God put you/us on this Earth to make a point? Does he have to? Is there a point to everything? Should there be a reason for living? If you don't achieve all that you dream of achieving and are still content, are you a loser because you didn't get what you wanted or are you a winner because you don't want no more?So are dreams really important? Am I really important? 200 years later there will be no trace of this magazine or the person who wrote it. But the ideas will persist. That makes the thought important, more like significant, than I, the creator or thinker of these thoughts.   I may get two minutes of fame in the future, when I am 40 and dying of lung cancer. Is that worth wasting my youth doing what I don't want to do then? Is doing what I don't want to do really a waste? If not, am I gaining something here?Should you gain something from everything you do? If you gain nothing, is that an experiment that went wrong? So how can an experiment, where you cannot really predict an outcome, ever go wrong?   If you gain a lot, and you think you gained from a mistake, will you repeat the mistake, even if you know making it the second time would be harmful/hurtful/stupid? But if you do gain, isn't the mistake much better than all the corrects you have done in your life?So can you really control your life? Can you say with certainty that at 9 am tomorrow you will wear a red T-shirt and eat eggs for breakfast? So what is definite? Is anything? Does definite give you a sense of security? Is security tantamount to safe? Do all these questions merit answers? Does anyone have the answers to them? Are these questions really questions or statements with a question mark at the end?Does that matter at all?  ************************************************************************************* I am a question mark reincarnate. This is my mind being me. As for the time, I wrote this after I read the book Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather, at a particularly complex and crossroad-ical juncture of my life.  ] d e e p a [

      Silence of the Crowd  It's not enough. Or is it?Flowing water. Curbed thoughts. Expression suspended. Spiraling smoke.An amulet encircling my thumb. Uncomfortably numb.I want more. Or not. Will I stop looking?This is the beginning.Or the end?No I am not stoned.Blinking cell. Blue and white.Disgusting noise. Eclectic psycho-babble.Long hair. Unfinished looks. Bald man; doesn't smoke.Spiraling smoke.Crystal ashtray. Pen moving. Thoughts astray. Crumpled tissue..Non blank cheque, enclosed inside. Uncashed yet.Trying to hide or reveal.Noisy water. Crowded train. Beaded nose ring.Not too bored. No motion, of thoughts or feet, or things, living or unmanifest, just water.Silence in words. Words of silence. So who defines natural? Conservative courts? Closed minds?Filthy, rotten books, wormed into by aging decay.I don't want to be Jesus. I don't want to be an angel.I don't want to be anything.  Being John Malkovich. I don't want to be him.  ********************************************************************************** I wrote it partly on a crumpled tissue paper and partly on the backside of an ICICI credit card bill envelope. I put down the first thing that came to mind when i saw&nbsp;OR felt anything.   ] d e e p a [

       The Birthday Speech  I don’t know why Shona has asked me to speak at her birthday. I’m not good at these things. Don’t like giving birthday speeches. I’m afraid that I’ll come out to be too critical or my jokes will fall flat. I’ve known Shona for such a long time, and there are times I feel that I don’t know her at all.   Shona likes her space. I’ve never known anyone who likes quiet time so much. She likes her quiet in the morning just when she gets up. She reads a lot. She likes interesting people. She has her mood swings. Does one talk about such things at a birthday party? Remember, I will be competing with the wine for attention.   Shona’s friends are a mixed bag. There are those that have 9-5 jobs in financial corporations. I met another group some time ago. They were second generation Asians discussing the body as a space for cultural identity. I know that Shona’s interested in culture. She did a degree in it. She grew up in three different countries. I don’t know what she calls home. She says that she’s a cultural anomaly. She smiles when she says this. Must be hard not fitting in. Making friends knowing you will have to let them go in a few years. Having to explain your life over and over again to people who nod their heads but don’t quite understand.  I don’t understand these discussions on space and identity. For me space is full of stars and planets. I know that Shona wanted to be an astronaut when she was small. She was one of those chubby Indian kids in England. Her mum used to dress her up in frilly dresses with white knee high socks. If you ask her now, she will tell you that the 1980s was the era of bad fashion. A well-meaning family friend told Shona that she was too fat to be an astronaut when she was 7. Shona lost interest in space after that. Exercise is something Shona caught on to since she started university. Now, she’s in India and her relatives tell her that she’s too thin (and too dark) to bag a husband.   Life is full of contradictions. I never thought that Shona would end up in India. I know that she was scared when her parents decided to move to Kolkata into the arms of a conservative family. She moved with them. A concrete jungle for a girl who grew up in a small English town, a tiny rain forested equatorial country, and ended up in the leafy suburbs of Sydney. She misses her green space. She misses her independence. Her snot has turned black because of the pollution. She has also grown up.   There are a lot of things about Shona I could say. I don’t know how appropriate they would be for a birthday. I know that she wishes her clever/quirky younger sister or that her best friend/boyfriend were here. Neither of them will be. One remains in London and the other in Sydney. Maybe that’s why Shona asked me to give a speech. I sit here racking my brains. I’ve never written a birthday speech before. What does one say?&nbsp; &nbsp;  ~shona~

      tonight i read her blog. i didn't expect it to make me so terribly terribly sad. a little dull cold clot will stay somewhere inside me forever now. or so it seems. strange that my own (apparent) tragedies having left me unfazed a stranger's bittersweet reproaches should hurt so bad. should sink me into a deep dark place inside my head. a black black mood creeps slowly over me. what do you do when life hits you below the belt? pulls the mat from under your feet? what do you do when you realize how vulnerable you are. how fragile. one word, one gesture could shatter you into a million tiny shards impossible to put back together again. ever. one day he will tire of my voice, find no joy in my laugh, no passion in my words. what then? for the sake of self preservation be bad. be a bad bad girl. be disparaging, cruel, ruthless, indifferent. if life's a bitch then so am i.

      'the god of small things' on a crowded bookshelf at home between 'our films, their films' by satyajit ray and a collection of 1990 o'henry awards prize stories. but why did she make me fall in love with velutha only to kill him so brutally? i'd love to be ammu when she's happy with rahel and estha and velutha, and i definitely want to look like her :)   how come i wasn't struck this bad the last time i read it in '97? the impending doom of the inexpressible sadness of things approaches.   the last chapter can now ever only remind me of the one and only

      sis left today. all of us (including grandmama) went to the airport to see her off. i wanted her to vanish into the check-in as soon as we got there but mom and dad kept her hanging around for much longer. i didn't even hug her and that was mighty obvious since everyone else did 5 times over. later we waited at the observation tower till the plane took off. then i came home and slept and woke up at 12 and cried in the shower for like 20 minutes. i'm turning into wierd al yankovich.

      i wrote&nbsp;this in a particularly dark moment yesterday:  'there are a million reasons we will never see eye to eye and you can't just wake up one fine day and decide to be best friends with your daughter who hardly gives a fuck in the first place about being your daughter. no, i don't want to tell you what i write about. and i don't want you to do my hair. and i don't want you to see when i smile. and i don't want you to know who i am. why are we condemned to bear our parents' hell?'

      by declaring i do not wish to be with any members of my family on my birthday, that i would rather die, that i want to forget my birthday is on the day it is on, that i wish she had aborted me so i wouldn't have to suffer any birthdays ever, that i will try and get a ticket to mumbai before the 10th and if i don't i'll still make sure i don't see them that day, and no amount of cajoling and coaxing and requesting can make me change my mind now since i've gone overboard anywayz and it's too much of an ego hassle to say that it's ok let's just celebrate my miserable birthday together.
