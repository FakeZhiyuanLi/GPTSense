      "I got pussy everywhur. Weed in the aur. I'm in my underwhur." J-Kwon needs to learn how to talk. He on something terrible.  Hmm. I want to have stripper auditions like Naya did. I've been reading a lot of old blogs and we used to say some stupid shit. It's this one conversation we had with Sera [y'all don't know her] and then others I had with Keeshia. Just dumb stuff. Arguing over who stroked on Dreux the night before....

       ...and i saw britney spears soon to be bootleg looking family on the cover of people magazine. and i thought to myself, is this bitch the dumbest broad in america or what. not only does she have a step-child, she has another one on the way. and the mom is a black. and she sees no problem with that? i don't think she's ready. and why her soon-to-be husband look like a bootleg version of a backstreet, gone through rehab. or maybe i have too much time on my hands.. i don't know.

       Why the hell is Christina Milian dating Lil Jon?...and he just got finished with Mya even though I heard she look like a dog in person. But still! They just don't go together. That's like mixing wine with milk and trying to call it a drink. What could you possibly want with him anyway???   I was in the record store and for a second I actually contemplated getting Ashlee Simpson's album. I don't know why I like her so much more than her sister. Even though her whole damn family is just ridiculously stupid and she's not too far off her damn self, I do. She has a tad,  just a  tad , bit more sense than the rest of them. "Everybody was kong foo fighting....YAH!"

       hunky dory. frick. stroke. Juju.      I'm jealous of Lindsay Lohan. How the hell do you go from being flatter than a book cover to having your cleavage all droolable by sexinesses like Ashton Kutcher? And why come one of the Olsen twins on crack? What the hell happened when SHE turned 18? I wonder if anybody over 21 has hit that yet?
