      Remember the happy simpler times When you thought that the friends that you made now, Would be your friends forever. Sleepover parties were considered cool, And all boys no matter what age had ‘couties’. Remember playing with Barbie and her boyfriend Ken. Barbie wasn’t a feminist And it was okay for her and Ken to sleep together Even if we didn’t know what ‘sex’ was. Those were the days when you didn’t worry about, Hair, make-up, sex, STD’s or pregnancy tests. I wish life was still so simple and friends were still, Honest and real. I still remember the endless days of summer, Playing tag in the park and making mud pies, After it had rained. Remember the girly giggles and wide-eyed smiles, When you had a birthday and you got to spend it with The people that meant the most to you. I often dream of being 6 again, You know the age when you dreamed of being 18, Cause those girls had it all. But really they didn’t. I still whish I could go back to the carefree days of, Yesterday.

      Fraternities obstruct morbidity  While mutilation bewilders liberty Jealousy gauges perception  As suspicious pressure humiliates  Unassuming freshman.

      Stars sparkle in the black of night; Glittering beauty crowning the Goddess In all her glorious splendour. The moon glows beckoning her children. They celebrate their mother, on this, The fullest of the moon. From the waxing to the waning, The new to the full, The moon is our guidance, The goddess at her best. Lighting the way for us to follow Her back to the earth,  Where we can all once again Become her seedlings.

      His memory is etched in stone, His name rolls off the breeze; His wounds are my wounds too, While his legacy is my soul tattoo.

       Ageless shadows dance across the dawn, Memories of the people that used to inhabit this land. Shapeless images sway through the breeze Silently calling to the earth. Cries can be heard above the roar of the fire, Songs and chants honouring the spirits of the dead And blessing the souls of the living. Timeless traditions, spanning generations Keep the old ways alive. Keepers of the wild, Mother Nature and animals are brethren Revered among the elders of the tribe. Native to this land, their lineage surpasses that of the white man. No longer allowed to roam free in the wilderness they command. Their skin is no longer reminiscent of the Red people of old. Their sun hardened leather skin has softened and lightened.   Languages once spoken to differentiate the many tribes, Are now whispers. No longer a dominant force in trade, The natives are slowly being allowed to gain back What they have lost over the centuries, honour and pride. Once valiant warriors they now fight to save The various species they endangered. Their blood has been spilt for centuries upon their own soil, As they fight for survival against foreign enemies and themselves. Peaceful by nature, they honour the spirits of the dead, Both human and animal. Shaman’s is what they were in the past. Healer’s and doctor’s, healing both the wounded and the land. Their natural approach to medicine is no longer standard practice. They are sought out in times of great need, When western medicine has failed. Their wisdom surpasses that of the worldliest scholar; For knowledge of the earth is the most sacred knowledge of all. Understanding that we are all apart of a great cycle of life, Helps one to understand the native way of thought, Life and death are great rights of passage. For each new life created, one old life must be ended. In death comes re-birth. In what form you are re-born is for the Gods to decide. Ageless shadows dance across the horizon, Images of the people that were here long before the white man, And will be here long after. Native to this land, they command the wild And belong to the earth.

       Wind blows, swirling leaves around my feet, Circling Gods essence. My roots planted firmly In the soil of Gods word. Grounding me to my father, Humbling me in Jesus’ name. Sun shines lighting the darkness Attempting to break my faith, The Holy Spirit invades like a flood Washing my soul clean and Strengthening my bond with Jesus. Brothers we are, Brothers we will be, When his glory ascends the heavens And his presence captivates the earth My roots are firmly plantedIn the soil that is God’s Word.

      Words once written  inscribed on the land,  now withering away  with my rotting hand.  The dirt's been laid  upon my skin  to nourish my soul  and feed within.  The Goddess now calls  to my weary heart  her messages speak  sung like a lark.  The beauty that lies  within my grasp  is nothing more than  a pagan task.  There is nothing  left for me here  so off I do venture  with stinging ears  for my time has come  and I shall now pass  into a land  with no present or past.  The winters are not harsh here  and the summer's not too warm  for my restfulness will be longer  than my stay on mortal shores.  Await the rebirth I will,  with a renewed heart,  for the Goddess is my kinfolk  and from her wisdom I willnever part.

      Chasing dreams  Through time and mist  To a land once plentiful with gifts,  Over seas and through the skies  I do send my weary eyes.  Searching for the land beyond  Where ageless beauty  Rises with each dawn.  The home of the present  The home of the past  All gathering round  The Tor stone's path.  Hands clasped in ritual  Hearts singing with praise  For the Goddess  And her wondrous ways.  Laying dormant within our hearts  Is the land that time forgot,  Where cloaked maidens  Dance through the night  And hearth fire's burn  Big and bright.  Where robes are worn  To show your place  Among the women  Who spend their days  Steeped in knowledge  Passed from the realm  Where faeries frolic  And time stands still.  Avalon is home to those  Who worship the Goddess  And all she knows.

      Alone with thoughts of horrifying yesterdays,  And uncertain tomorrows. Each one suffocating my brain To the point of extinction. Tears well up in eyes too dry for crying. Stinging from the lack of moisture. Immovable words choking me, dying to escape. Memories of sad times  Elude the happy thoughts that never come. Death screams. It’s calling to the soul that has no future. Mine. Pain fills my heart, and squeezes it whole. Time passes by slowly, Never giving me a chance to reconcile my sorrowed youth. The end seems inevitable. Salvation no longer seems in sight. Drowning in thoughts and choking on words, My turmoil may soon be extinguished.

       While taking Journalism at Durham College a few years back, I spent most of my time focusing on the issues that hit close to home for me, Vegetarianism and Religion.  The following little blurb was the opening paragraph to an article I wrote on the topic of vegetarianism and the like.  It hits the issue in a fun manner and helps to grab the readers attention.  The poem that follows is one on the topic of acceptance and how I think that one person can make a difference.       'Welcome to the real world, where the arches are golden, take out is finger licking’ fried, and the cows are all mad.  In many ways there’s never been a better time to be a vegetarian.  It is definitely the wave of the future, but unfortunately, the present hasn’t quite caught up.'   Acceptance:   Why can’t people just accept That I’m different, Instead of trying to tell me Reasons why, Their way is the better way, And what I believe is wrong? No one understands the pain I feel in my heart When I see a piece of red meat frying in a pan; And why I get tears in my eyes  When I see fish packaged in can. Animals are living just like you and me. Since I don’t feast on my brother And he doesn’t feat on me; What makes it right to kill For the sake of consumption? When the earth provides a feast  That is fulfilling and tasty That doesn’t involve  The slaughtering of those  Who have no choice. They can’t speak up  For the purpose of saviour But can cry out in pain When the hunters shot the hunted And made his claim to fame. Everything that breaths has the right to live So why then do people take this sacred right away? Vegetables give protein just like the flesh of cows; And soy beans provide the same calcium  That also comes from a cow. Mother Nature provides us with ways  To feast off her, So why then do we kill the living Walking God’s green earth? You can push and shove your beliefs in my face But that won’t change the choice I made in my heart. Animals deserve the right to live And that right I plan to give.

        HAMLET:    To be, or not to be- that is the question: Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,  And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep  No more; and by a sleep to say we end  The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to. ‘Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish’d. To die- to sleep. To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,  Must give us pause. There’s the respect  That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,  Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,  The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay,  The insolence of office, and the spurns  That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,  When he himself might his quietus make  With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,  To grunt and sweat under a weary life,  But that the dread of something after death The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn  No traveller returns- puzzles the will,  And makes us rather bear those ills we have  Than fly to others that we know not of?  Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,  And thus the native hue of resolution  Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment  With this regard their currents turn awry  And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons  Be all my sins rememb’red.

      Twilight glistens like a halo, Surrounding this deserted town. Shattered windows and desolate images Are scattered in the wind. Memories of the metropolis  That used to line these streets. Vast alley ways, stretched out to a grandeur, That used to echo prominently In the traffic backed up for miles. Shops now abandoned, were once the featured attraction. Galleries and museums housing works by people, Whose obscurity meant nothing To those with obscure tastes, Are now stagnant with the pungent aroma of decay. Remnants of the world left behind Are apparent from the bodies Left to rot in the open; The casualties of time.

      You know what I don’t understand? Everyone’s preoccupation with the norm.  It’s as if being the exact make and model of your parents, is what the world really needs. Or so that’s what your parents want you to think.  Yeah right!  Like the world needs another clone of your parents.  I believe that what the world really wants is you!  What I mean by that is we don’t need exact clones running around, talking, walking, and dressing alike.  Stepford is not yet a reality, so let’s not encourage it.  You need to be your own person and speak your own mind, not someone else’s.    People seem to think that being exactly like everyone else is going to get you somewhere.  Yeah, it might if we lived in Gattaca, but thank god that was just a movie.    My philosophy has always been ‘what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger’ and it is one that I try to live by everyday, even if there have been times when even I have doubted it.    I don’t know what it is but there is a great sense of pride that comes from being your own person and standing up for what you believe in, even if it might land you in the big house for the night.  You can’t just pretend to be active in your beliefs, you need to really get out there and attempt to spread the word and even the gospel.  If with four simple letters WWJD (What Would Jesus Do) teens around the world can find a renewed sense of faith, doesn’t that mean that by speaking out about let’s say… vegetarianism, you night be able to change the world for one or two cows?  If you only touch one or two people you’ve still made a difference in someone’s life have you not?    Life may throw you a lot of curveballs but you have to be prepared and always take them with a grain of salt.  Sure, sometimes I just want to be like ‘Mike’, but doesn’t everyone?  That guy has it all.  You know who else I envy? Bo, cause Bo seems to know everything.  I have tried to live my life to the fullest by expanding my horizons in anyway possible.  I think that others should follow this model too.  In the end you’ll find things out about your self that you never knew, you never knew.  Hey you never know; you might even surprise yourself.    So why sit around waiting for your ship sail without you, when you could be the captain on a luxurious cruise to your destiny!?  Maybe along the way you’ll even concur a country or two, I know I certainly have.    So no matter what you are into and what you believe you need to be your own person and not someone else!  Follow your dreams because, dreams are what life is made of.    “All of your dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them.” – Walt Disney

        Mercutio:    O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes  In shape no bigger than an agate stone  On the forefinger of an alderman,  Drawn with a team of little atomies  Athwart men’s noses as they lie asleep;  Her wagon spokes made of long spinners’ legs,  The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;  Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web; Her collars, of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams;  Her whip, of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;  Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm  Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid;  Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,  Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,  Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers. And in this state she ‘gallops night by night  Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;  O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on cursies straight;  O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;  O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,  Which oft the angry  Mab with blisters plagues,  Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are. Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,  And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;  And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail  Tickling a parson’s nose as ‘a lies asleep,  Then dreams he of another benefice. Sometimes she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,  And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,  Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,  Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon  Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two  And sleeps again. This is that very Mab  That plats the manes of horses in the night  And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,  Which once untangled much misfortune bodes  This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,  That presses them and learns them first to bear,  Making them women of good carriage. This is she

      Tears blanket the pillow That my face is buried in. My eyes red and puffy Burn from too many shed. Pain rushes through  Every fibre of my being Sending my body into oblivion As my heart breaks  From another rejection. More proof that I was Meant to wallow alone In my pity and loneliness Until my dying day.

       For Joelle &amp; Jason:      Marriage is a sacred bond, Entered into by the heart. Allowing two people in love, A chance to make a start.  The honour of Husband and Wife, Isn’t something to be taken lightly, In retrospect it is one of God’s gifts That should be opened rightly.  Handling a marriage, Should be done with extreme care, For a couple who can make it last, These days seems rare.  Using caution and being open With each other, Will help to keep the flame burning In you for one and other.  Pushing through the tough times, Like a shovel in the snow, Will help to keep you grounded And raring to go!  Honesty is one trait You both should wear with pride, Because it words only cause pain When bottled up inside.  The secrets to a successful marriage Can’t be sold in books, But the knowledge comes from deep inside, You just need to look.  By putting your heart on the line In a deep situation such as this, Will help to give a new definition To the term wedded bliss.  Once the rings are placed upon the hands And the vows have been said, It’s up to you to make it last, By forging on ahead.  Moving into territory That is seldom traversed for long Will help to make you record holders For a marriage that is stong.  Being in strong in love and life Is something of a challenge, But faith in the Word of God Will bring you closer to his palace.  In these times of divorcees And spiritually bare lovers A couple that is as in love as you Makes even the skeptics want to blush.  Holding on to one another As you trudge ahead, Will help to make your journey All the more memorable For the generations still ahead.  As a new chapter is begun In the book of your life, I pray that you have The most blessed union As Husband and Wife.

        So I have been thinking about my spiritual delemma a lot more lately, especially since I am just starting a new job, Chapters!!!  If someone ever asked, what religion would I say I am!?  I used to take pride in saying I was Pagan, but I am not really feeling that part of me anymore.  I don't know what I believe!?  I have been calling my self Spiritually Bare, because essentially that is what I am.  I am not an Atheist because I believe in the idea of God or Gods I just don't know who!?  But I really don't want to have to put myself into that corner.  I mean I really do want to believe in something and someone.  God or Not, I need to believe.  I cannot go on Spiritually Bare forever, there is a big part of my that needs to have belief in some greater being and purpose.      So once again I feel I am at a crossroads with my faith.  I want to be Christian, but as mych as I feel it in my heart, I don't (if you know what I mean!?).  I am trying to find a happy medium between my varying beliefs, but I am not having any luck.  I have been checking up on every religion available to man, but I can't seem to find one that draws to me.  I used to think that Paganism did, but I have come to realize that over the 7 years I say that I practiced the religion, I hardly did anything in support of it.  I on rare ocassions celebrated and Sabbats, I ignored the full-moon, and talked to the Goddess and the rest of the Gods only when I felt like it.  I called my self Pagan and preached it to those who were interested but I never practiced what I preached.  I was and am a hypocrit.  No matter how hard I tried I was never fully into it.  I could be Pagan on the outside but never Pagan on the inside.  It is a fascinating anf wonderful religion and way of life, but it just never hit home for me like I tried to pretend it did.      I am beginning to feel like a celestial punching bag.  I keep jumping back and forth between varying faiths, including Buddhism and Kabbalah.  For the past few months things around my mind have been more Christian, books, music, wearing faithlets and crosses ect...  but none of this is helping/  I still feel like Chrisitanity isn't where my heart is.  Unless that is what my head is saying and my heart isn't loud enough to be heard!?      I really don't understand all of this.  It has been going on for 4 years and I can't get it to end.  For some stupid reason I feel it necessary to have one main faith and belief system in my life.  It is driving me to the point of insanity and back.  I have spent hours in prayer to both God/Jesus and the Goddess for answers to those plaguing my spiritual self, but to no avail I have come up empty handed everytime.  I have done everythin in my power, from reading parts of the Bible, to attending Church, to perfroming Goddess rituals, and none of this has gotten me anywhere.  It seems that all these tasks do is push me away.  Church seems to scare me, I have never had a good Church going expierence, and the Bible gets me frustrated, because there is so mych stuff that feels like pure non-sense to me.  Everytime I do a ritual I get scared and am afraid of the Goddesses presence.  I am not generally a frightened person (I do have my fears) but the thought of the power of the Goddess terryfies me.  I just wish that all of these parlour games would end so that I could get back to my worry free life and enjoy being 24 and single.

       Testing the waters of eternity, Combing the sands of time, Scanning the universe for answers To the questions running through my mind.  Who is God? And what does he do? Seems to be a riddle I’d like to fill.  What is salvation? And what have I done, To need to wash my soul clean and believe In some prodigal Son?  What is heaven? And why does there need To be a hell? Is one answer I’d like spilled.  Why did Jesus die for me? And how do I get to eternity?  These questions plague non-believers, All those who don’t understand, The gloriousness that is JesusAnd God, creator of this great land.

        Through hardships untold And heartaches unnumbered I have fought my way here, To the kingdom of my father. Through perilous journey’s Over land’s covered with temptations I have triumphed my way here To the gates of heaven. Through eyes once clouded And a heart once jaded, I have believed my way here To the splendour of heaven. Through words confessed with my mouth And deeds done with my hands I have prayed my way here To the glory of my father’s kingdom, Heaven.

       The writings on the wall I should have known I’d take this fall I gave it everything I had But you showed me our love was not to be. She opened your eyes towards the sky And you left me with the confusion that is heart-ache.  ** Broken down trains, Burnt out planes, Out love faded in the dust Of your Camaro. Watching you head west Towards the sun And the endless freedom You found in saying goodbye.  I cried out your name Hoping you’d change your mind And come back to me. But our love was not to be. I was a fool believing you When you said that we Would always be My heart is broken and torn in two But I have vowed to get over you.  ** Broken down trains, Burnt out planes, Out love faded in the dust Of your Camaro. Watching you head west Towards the sun And the endless freedom You found in saying goodbye.
