      So I went to the movies with my sister tonight.  Even though we'd just eaten supper, we stopped to get candy at Target and then proceeded to get popcorn  and  nachos at the concession stand.  Of course, the Diet Coke (which has no calories) I drank cancelled those things out. (Don't I wish.)  Why is it impossible to bypass things like popcorn and candy at the movies, even if I am not hungry?  Why is it, when I am watching the movie I find my hand constantly moving back and forth between my mouth and the popcorn?  This morning I ate cereal at work.  I ate Lucky Charms with 2% milk.  Did you know Lucky Charms has fewer calories than Cinnamon Toast Crunch? I was going to have soup for lunch, and indeed, I had several spoonfuls, but I was emotionally upset about something so I couldn't finish.  Finally: I am upset and  not  eating.  Usually when I am upset I have to eat.  Not that I want to be upset, it is just bound to happen.  Of course, I made up for not having lunch by chowing at the theater.

      OK so this is not my first blog, but this is in addition to "Happy, Just a Little Flustered" which can be found  urlLink here .  This is going to be my weight loss or "wellness" blog.  Whatever.  So I am a fat ass and I know it.  I am 5'4" and weigh about 210#.  I hate the way I look, I hate the way I look and feel in my clothes.  I hate buying bigger clothes.  I hate having to shop at the fat girl store.  I hate not wearing the cute stuff I want to wear.  I don't want to have health problems now or ever.  I don't want to look like my mother when I am her age.  I hate not eating what I want when I want.  This week I was pretty good.  I went to the gym Monday night, Tuesday night and yesterday night.  I ate fairly well this week except for a small Blzzard from DQ last night.  My mom started to ask if I thought I was shooting myself in the foot for eating that blizzard, but I didn't want to hear it.  I am sick of eating carrot sticks.  Dammit, I want ice cream, especially on a hot, humid night after I spend an hour in the gym sweating my ass off.  I DESERVE that Blizzard, right?  Speaking of sweating my ass off, boy, I wish that was possible.  If I could lose weight by melting off my fat, I would find a friend with a car that has those heated seats and I would fry my ass.  I have not always been fat.  I have always been chunky.  I got fat last year when I went on anti-depressant medication.  Don't get me wrong, I was already overweight by that time.  However, the meds have exacerbated the problem.  So today for breakfast I ate some crackers and cheese, and I had a glass of 2% milk.  I had a sandwich for lunch and didn't eat (except for 2 pretzel rods) until supper.  I feel pretty good about my day up until that point.  I ate two cheeseburgers.  But I did eat 3 oz of baby carrots.  But then I ate 2 giant cookies.  I didn't have time to go to the gym today b/c I had to go to practice at church after supper.  Oh well.  Tomorrow is another day.  Well, that is enough for today.

      So I just looked at my blog, and there are  FOOD  ads above it!   FOOD!  And for CHEESE no less.  Why does my life center around food?  Why?  I don't live to eat, but I wish I was at the place where I eat to live.  I consume a lot of unnecessary things.  It makes me happy to eat.

      We got extra time to work on the presentations for my Report Writing class.  So I am spending some of that time goofing off!  Imagine that,  me , procrastinating.  Well the instructor is not here to supervise, and most of the students took off anyway.  Plus, I was mostly done with my presentation, I just have a few small adjustments to make.  So I am going to take the free time to play with my blog.  Yippie!

      Much thanks to LadyEd for supplying this link:  urlLink What kind of cheese are you?   I am a yellow-orange, rectangle-shaped cheese. I am very popular. I have lots of zip and energy and love to jump around. I am sharp and clever, but also sometimes a little stubborn.  The most widely purchased and eaten cheese in the world. Cheddar cheeses were originally made in England, however today they are manufactured in many countries all over the world. Fully cured Cheddar is a hard, natural cheese. It is shaped like a drum, 15 inches in diameter, with natural rind bound in cloth. Normally, the color of Cheddar ranges from white to pale yellow. Some Cheddars, however, have a color added, giving the cheese a yellow-orange color. Cheddar is always made from cow's milk and has a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured. If the cheese is too young, the texture is smooth. Cheddar gets a sharper taste the longer it matures. It is generally matured between 9 and 24 months. The important thing in purchasing Cheddar, is to consider the age of the cheese. Milk is heated to 86 degrees F and inoculated with a lactic starter culture. After an hour rennet is added. When the curd is firm, it is ground down to marble-sized bits which are heated to 100 degrees F. The whey is discarded and it is sliced into slabs. The curd is pressed overnight and stands for 4 days in a cool atmosphere. Unlike other well known cheeses, Cheddar's name is not protected so it has been used and abused by many producers around the world. [ Country: England || Milk: cow milk || Texture: semi-hard ]

      Well, since I talk about food so much, I might as well tell you what I had for lunch.  I went to Portillo's with Sandy and Leslie.  I ate a jumbo chili dog with cheese  plus  cheese fries!  Yum.  I can almost feel my waist expanding now...and I was doing so well this week.

      Today has been a good day.  I did good as far as keeping my calorie intake low.  Of course, now that it's after 4pm, it is a little more difficult not to snack.  In Accounting class this morning, the instructor was able to help me straighten out where I went wrong with the comprehensive problem, and we discussed the tax form I was having trouble with.  The weather was beautiful today!  We reached into the lower 70's.  I rode around with my windows rolled down.  Tomorrow will be even better.

      I found the note I wrote myself about Cheetos.  I was going to put it in, but it's pretty much what I posted yesterday.  Well, there is this part I didn't add yesterday about how when we're kids we want to do fun things that are bad like lighting matches.  Anyway, today was a strange day.  I was up late last night working on a project for my Business Report Writing class.  It got to be midnight so I decided to print the thing in the morning.  So then I woke up late this morning and I still had to print the project.  First I had to run to the basement to get more paper for my printer.  Then I ran back up to the second story to switch on my computer and wait for it to boot.  It finally booted and I pulled up the document I had to print.  However, my dumb printer took F O R E V E R to print.  By this time, it was 7:45.  I'm supposed to be at work from 7:30 to 9am.  So I called in to work and said that I wouldn't come in for the 1 1/2 hours but would come in after my 9:30-10:45 class as usual.   So I got to take a shower.  I didn't get to take one last night.  So I prettied myself up.  Because the printer was still printing.  And it was only 9 or 10 pages!  I toddled off to school early, stopping at Walgreens for Cheetos (YES more Cheetos) and Diet Coke and string cheese.  At school, I completed the Works Cited page (I couldn't finish it at home because I only used internet sources and I don't have the internet at home) and my project was complete and ready to turn in. WOO!  Then, in class, the instructor introduced a  new  project that is due next Wednesday.  At least she gave us time in class to work on it.  But what is dumb about the new project is that it is a presentation we have only one week to prepare.  Compare this to the project we just turned in.  She gave us two weeks, and we didn't even have to get up and talk about it.  Anyway, I'm at work now, stealthily typing in my blog while I should be working.  Oh well.  It's after 5 now, and there aren't many people left to care...  Kris called around 3:30 to say hi.  I told him I was going to throw things if I don't end up with an A in my LIT class.  He said not to.  Well I'm out of things to say for now.  Maybe I'll think up some more drivel later.

      So today, being new to the blog world, I was thinking about my blog, and what to write in it.  And since I'm such a fat-ass foodie, my thoughts naturally turned to food.  I thought about how much I love Cheetos and Diet Coke.  I thought about pizza and tacos.  I even thought about vegetables.  It seemed rather annoying to me that I crave things that taste good but are bad for me, and that I don't crave things that are good for me.  I really don't dislike vegetables and healthy things, I just like Cheetos and tacos better.  Plus, it's disturbing how much I think about food.  Once I made my sister laugh: I was thinking about food again, and I said out loud,  "I don't like chicken with bones."  My sister exploded with laughter, and I was startled, because I hadn't realized I'd spoken out loud.  She still makes fun of me because of that.

      Waiting for class to begin...  It's nice to have a few minutes to sit and relax.  My life seems so full and busy.  I love going to school.  And work, while annoying sometimes, is rather fulfilling.  I just wish I could go to school full time.  I enjoy learning, and actually kind of like doing homework and studying.  (NURD! NURD! I'm a NURD!)  People ask me what career I would like to go into, and I would like to have a pat answer.  Honestly, a full-time, life-long student is what would make me happy.  Or at least that's what I think would make me happy.

      Well, its Saturday night, and Kris and I are going out to  urlLink El Puente  with some friends.  Right now I'm waiting for Kris and Charlie to stop by and pick me up.  I love Mexican food and margaritas.  Since I have nothing better to do, (and apparently you don't, either, if you are taking the time to read this), I will tell you about my day.  I woke up and went to the  urlLink gym , then came home and cleaned the bathroom.  I used one of those new  urlLink Fresh Brushes .  I like them.  Then I took a shower in my newly cleaned bathroom.  After that, I toddled off to work.    On the way, Leslie called and asked if I wanted lunch from  urlLink Panera .  I had her get me the You Pick Two with the Asiago Roast Beef sandwich (with mayo, not horseradish) and the Seafood Bisque.  We stayed at work until 4.  Then we went to Sandy's house.  She is moving and wanted to see if we wanted any of the clothes she was going to get rid of.  Then, Leslie and I went to LA Tan.  Afterwards, I went to Focas and had my eyebrows waxed.  My boyfriend thinks that getting one's eyebrows waxed is a frivolous idea.  So what. I went home and played on the computer.  I took a bath and got ready to go out.  I am wearing a black/white wrap top with a knee-length black skirt.  I put on my fake pearl earrings and bracelets.  Now I am telling you about my day because Kris and Charlie are still not here yet.  They are probably out smoking somewhere.  Oh well, I can't think of anything else to say.  My hair is really fluffy today.  I'm not sure that I like it like that.  It won't do what I tell it to.  My (recently removed) eyebrows are still red; I hope the guys will just think it is eyeshadow.  Kari will be too nice to say anything.  I need a chair for my computer desk.  Currently, I am perched on a step stool.  Not the ideal seating arrangement.  Hold on, let me go turn on the porch lights...  ...OK.    Here they are!  No more time for inanities, time for fun!

      Well this is the beginning of the end of the semester.  Thankfully, I got out of taking a final for BUS 142 Report Writing. Today I have to turn in a paper, and I am done with that class. Tomorrow, in ACC 100 Intro to Accounting, we don't have a final per se, but we are taking an audit test on a comprehensive problem.  Wednesday night, in my LIT 229 Novel and Film class, we aren't taking a test, but our "final" is to bring in a movie clip and talk about it.  It will take all of five minutes. So no real finals for me this semester.  Sort of anti-climactic if you ask me.  I'm just glad to be done with this semester.  Ready for a fresh one.

      Blech.  So I was going to go to  urlLink school  and take this proficiency test to show that I don't really need to take CIS 110 Introduction to Computers.  I got all the way to school, in the building and even opened the door to the Testing Center before I realized...I didn't remember to bring the Proficiency Credit Application Form that I had gone to such lengths not only to obtain but also to get approved to take the test.  So I turned around and went to work instead.  I could've gone home, retrieved the form, and went back to school to take the test, but no, I didn't.  Instead, I am here at work, where I don't really want to be, and I am not doing any work yet.  I hope to  urlLink waste enough time  to take me through to lunch, get some lunch with Leslie, then waste more time until I decide to leave...Hey!  That's what I do every Saturday!  Last night, I hung out with Kris for a while.  He still isn't feeling 100% so he didn't go to work.  I think I helped him feel better. ;)  We will probably go to  urlLink Florida  and spend time at his parent's beach house after our summer sessions are over.  We had so much fun the last time we went.  The weather is not as nice as the meteorologists had said it would be.  Instead of being inspired to go out and get some fresh air, I am inspired to go home and go back to bed.  Or at least watch the  urlLink Three's Company  marathon on  urlLink TV Land .  Of course, I should be studying and completing the last few homework assignments.  But I don't want to do that either.

Yes I did know James Coe, but he wasn't old and he wasn't slow.  But I never just called him James or Jim or Jimmy; I always called him by his first and last name. Oh, btw, I suck at making up things that are supposed to be funny.  I once knew a guy named James Coe He walked and he talked way too slow So I told him to hasten but he didn't listen That old slow guy that was named Coe  Sorry James Coe, wherever you are today.

      I just sneezed and my eye started twitching.  My eye has been doing that the last day or so.  Mostly it happens when I am stressed or angry.  Well, today I am feeling a lot better than the last two days.  I had a nice long conversation with Kris last night and I love him more than ever.  He is a great boyfriend despite the little things that I let annoy me.  Last night I read this article in Cosmo about how to be soul-mates with your significant other.  I found out that Kris and I already do all the things Cosmo said to do!  So I am looking forward to this summer, it should be the best yet.  This weekend, Kris and I will think about where we want to go on vacation after our summer sessions are over.

      Today was Eat What you Want Day.  So I did.  I wanted ice cream for lunch and that is what I ate.  I ate my Dairy Queen Reese's Pieces  urlLink Blizzard  (a medium is approximately 950 calories) as I drove around, thinking and trying to relax.  The more I think about things, the more confused I get.  When I try to explain how I feel, I don't feel like my true intentions come across properly.  I feel like no matter how I explain my words, actions or thoughts, no one will really understand my meaning or intent.  Take last night for example.  I don't think that Kris will understand why I am upset, and he will probably just tell me I shouldn't be upset.  Plus, I kind of brushed off the issue today on the phone.  I made him think I am upset about school, which I am, but that is not really why I was crying on the phone.  Maybe I don't know my boundaries...like how upset should I be?  How do I know which fights to fight, and which to let lie.  I don't worry too much about Kris, and I am not really afraid he will cheat on me.  Mostly I am afraid of being left out of the fun.  Plus I want to know what is going on...I need to be communicated with.  Kris is not always the best at doing that.  Last night before I went to bed, I wrote about all this in my paper journal, in the hopes that getting things off my chest would help me fall asleep without stewing.  It worked, but today, last night is mostly what I thought of.  I am trying to be a good girlfriend.  I don't want Kris to think he is pussy-whipped; I don't want Kris to  be  pussy-whipped.  I don't want him to think he needs to clear his schedule with me, but if he tells me to call him before I come over, and when I call him he doesn't answer or leave me a message that he has made other plans, I feel hurt.  I feel like he doesn't always respect me, my time, and the sacrifices I sometimes make to spend time with him.  I don't mind making sacrifices for Kris, or doing things for him.  Its just that I expect sacrifices made for me in return.  I have cut class for him plenty times, and skimped on homework so we could spend time together.  I don't think he has done that for me.  I don't know if Kris would understand all this.  He is very understanding and supportive, but maybe all this only makes sense to me.  I know Kris loves me, and I love him.  This is just another  urlLink bump  in the road.

      I haven't posted lately.  Maybe I would if I had more time.  The spring semester is coming to a close, so I am preoccupied with papers and exams and homework....I am also trying to work 40 hours a week and have a life besides.  I wish I was better at balancing things.  I wish I was better at prioritizing, especially at work.  I got in trouble again today for letting service orders slip through the cracks.  I begin with the best intentions but then decide I don't care today, I'm going to procrastinate.  I think I should dust off my goals and start fresh.  I also need to start fresh with my eating habits (I am going to stop using the word "diet").  Dr. Ward says I have to have lost 8 lbs by the time I see him again in two weeks.  Blech.  I haven't been doing so well the past 5-6 days.  I need to stop beginning my sentences with "I."  So, this last weekend was nice, I spent it with Kris.  I cooked him supper Friday night and breakfast Saturday morning.  When the two of us weren't at work, we had a lot of time to relax and veg.  I'm looking for a creative outlet.  Maybe this is it.  Maybe my paper journal is my outlet.  Maybe books and magazines are what I'm looking for.  Lately, I have been hungering to experience something, learn something I won't learn at school.  I've been buying and checking out a lot of books lately.  Also, I have been ravenously devouring magazines and newspapers.  I have also actually been reading my Word-A-Day e-mails.  This often happens at this point in the semester.  I love to learn, and at the beginning of a semester, I am so interested in the classes I am taking.  Then my interest begins to wane, and I start looking for another mental stimulus.  Speaking of which, I have been checking out  urlLink Mental Floss  daily and taking the quizzes.  The well of thoughts have run dry.  That is enough for today.

      Well I was sleepy about an hour ago after I finished reading  Sushi for Beginners  by Marian Keyes.  Then I got on the computer to check just one little thing.  Here I am still glued to the monitor.  Now I am wide awake.  Which is not good.  I will be a wreck tomorrow (today??) if I don't get some sleep.    You see tomorrow (today??) is my birthday.  WOO HOO.  Anyway, I am going to Chicago and Kris and I will meet up with some friends.  We hope to get last-minute tix to the Cubs game.  If that doesn't work out, we will go to a bar nearby and watch the game on tv. And drink a lot.  So comment and wish me happy birthday.

      Today's topic  du jour  was not the transfer of power in Iraq.  No, it was not the latest on Jack Ryan's aborted Senate race.  Today, we were all abuzz about an earthquake rating a 4.5 on the Richter scale.  This morning, at around 1:10am CST, an earthquake, well, quaked.  I was still wide awake.  My brother had just come home, so when things in my room started rattling, I thought he was moving furniture or something.  However, the rattling increased and continued for about 10-15 seconds.  I said to myself, "An earthquake!  No, this is Illinois.  We don't get earthquakes (a fallacy, obviously).  Well, it must have been an explosion.  But I have been wide awake for some time, and I did not hear any explosion.  The shaking feels like someone hit our house with a car.  But I did not hear any crash.  It  must  be an earthquake.  How odd."  Of course, all this took place in the aforementioned 10-15 seconds.  Well, turns out I was right about the earthquake.  Those of you reading my blog out in California (if anyone reads this, I will die laughing because NO ONE could possibly be interested in my boring blog) must be laughing your pants off right now.  Send pictures.  No. Don't.  And don't laugh at me for freaking over a 4.5 earthquake.  This midwesterner has never felt an earthquake before.  Oh well...on to another topic...hmm...fresh topic...Ok, well off to bed!

      Well, well, well. I sure have stayed away from my blog for too long. What has happened recently?  Let's see...   NY Trip  I flew in and out of NY for a quick trip earlier this month.  I have never been there, and while I didn't get to see the city (except the view from the airplane) I enjoyed my stay.  Kris and I visited his relatives with his mother.  We stayed with the grandparents (this meant separate bedrooms) and ate and drank and talked a lot.  His family was very gracious and welcoming to me.  Kris and I hope to go back to NYC in August.  The plan is to hang out with his cousin (who graduated from law school this month and was the reason for our trip) in Manhattan.  We would also like to go chill in the Hamptons with another cousin who works there as a personal trainer.   After Shock  I was sick for two days after I arrived home, but I still managed to turn in my first batch of homework for the summer one week ahead of the deadline.   A Beautiful Day for a Ballgame  I went to the Indians vs. Sox game on Tuesday.  The Sox had been dealing with a losing streak.  I told Kris that every time I've been to a Sox game, they've won.  Tuesday night's game was no exception.  It was, however, a close call.   Looking Ahead  This next week or so looks promising.  My birthday is Wednesday, and I am taking the day off work.  I plan to go into Chicago and spend time with Kris.  We will try to make it into the Cubs game that evening.  If that doesn't work out, we will hang out at a bar nearby.  Now, this coming weekend will be So Much Fun.  Kris' friend Noel is coming to town on Friday.  I will be hanging out with Jenny (we are going to Tia Maria's to celebrate my birthday).  Saturday and Sunday I will be in the city.  We will check out the Taste of Chicago, and view the fireworks on the 3rd.  Kris also said he has a surprise planned for me.  I think I know what he has planned, but I don't want to say because I don't want to jinx it.

      Well it is still raining out.  But I made to the gym.  I did 1/2 an hour on the elliptical machine.  Today I did the "weight loss" program which is 4 minutes on level 1, 4 minutes on level 8, and so on until you get to 28 minutes.  I did an extra 2 minutes on level 1.  I want something to eat, but I don't want to go anywhere to get it.  I suppose I won't go hungry, I have enough reserved fat to keep me alive a very long time.  Well, tomorrow I leave for NY and I will have fun.  I am almost all packed and ready to go!  I am glad I have the morning off work, I think I will take my car in for an oil change and then go to White Hen to get Kris some beef jerky for the trip.  We are flying standby so I am bringing provisions in case we have some sitting around time.  So I will blog to you later, maybe Sunday night or Monday, depending on what time I make it home.

      I am hot and sticky.  The weather is humid, and I went tanning after work, so I have tanning lotion clogging up my pores.  I should go to the gym and work out but I don't want to.  Of course, I won't go in the morning, and I will be out of town all weekend, so I will go to the gym.  Boo. Hey there was a puzzle on Wheel of Fortune just now that was Star Trek-related, and I got it before any of the contestants!!! I can't wait to tell Kris, because I know he will double over laughing.  He knows I HATE Star Trek.

      I couldn't stay away from the computer.   I didn't even crack a book.  Now I am exhausted, and don't have the energy to read (shocking!).  Instead, I spent time obsessing about what I am going to wear this weekend.  I think my list is complete, and I have even begun to set items aside for packing later.  Really, I should go to bed.  However, I know that cute black and pink outfits will dance through my dreams, and then the clothes will refuse to pack into my carry-on properly, and my cute dream will turn into a nightmare!  I promised myself that I can do it; I can pack enough items for this weekend into a carry-on...well, a carry-on  and  the largest purse I own.  I am notorious for over-packing.  Well, you never know what you might need!  What if, when I arrive at my destination, I don't like the one nail polish I packed? That is why you bring the whole spectrum of colors.  Of course, when all is said and done, I don't end up using ANY of them, but that is beside the point.  What is the point?  I forgot already.  Anyway, I promised myself I will not overpack for this trip.  I don't know how I will do it, but do it I will.

      Just surfing around tonight.  When I logged on to Blogger, I read the new article about audioblogging.  I got distracted when I noticed that Chuck Palahniuk audioblogs, so I started checking out his  urlLink site.   It just served as a reminder that there are so many books, so little time.  In addition to the Palahniuk books on my shelf waiting to be read, there are so many others.  I hate when I start to read 4 different books; I don't end up finishing any of them.  Well, instead of blogging about reading, I think I will read.  Tonight's selection:  A Place So Foreign and 8 more  by Cory Doctorow (courtesy of my boyfriend, Kris)...No wait...I should finish  Survivor  by the above-mentioned Chuck Palahniuk.  You see what I mean about so many books, so little time!!

      Well I am tired of seeing that dumb quiz at the top of my blog, so I thought I'd fill the space with words.  Monday was fun.  I ate and drank and smoked, and it was great.  Tuesday was less fun because I had to go to work.  But Tuesday night I went to the gym with Kris, so that was good.  Wednesday afternoon, Kris took me out to lunch at Corfu, a Greek restaurant near my office.  Wednesday night we went to the gym again.  His dad made bratwurst for supper, and they were yummy!  Today, Kris took me out for a picnic lunch!  He brought a complete, healthy lunch.  After we ate, we took a little stroll.  After work, I ate supper at home, then started some laundry.  I went to the gym and the store, then later I went out to meet Kris and Charlie at the Mexican restaurant in WeGo that I can never remember the name of.  We had some beer, then I came home.  I am glad I went to the gym or otherwise exercised every day this week.  I know that if I can make it part of my everyday routine during the summer, I will be more likely to keep it up during the school year.  Speaking of school, Kris starts classes on Monday. =(  But next Friday, we leave for New York!  Whoopee!!!  I have never been to NYC but I am looking forward to it.  I am a little intimidated.  Not necessarily of his family, but of the NYC and Long Island scene.  I don't know what to wear, and I am afraid I will come off as some country bumpkin.  Oh well.  I will cross that bridge when I get to it!  For now, I will tuck myself into bed and have sweet dreams.  Good night!

      So this template is a lot better.  I think it better represents me.  I'm still working on adding all my links back into the template.  No thank you to the unhelpful Blogger help staff.  I am not an html wiz you know!  Whatever.  So I like to start my paragraphs with the word "so."  I don't know why, I just like it.  Anyway, Monday night I went to the Sox game with Kris, Ed and this guy whose name is Jeff but he looks like Rivers Cuomo so that's what Kris and I call him when he's not around.  The Sox lost to the twinkies but we had fun anyway!  I hung out with Kris a lot this week, we went swimming and tonight we went to see  I, Robot .    Earlier I had my eyebrows waxed.  Kris always makes fun of me when I do that.  He thinks it is a frivolous thing, but I refuse to pluck, so there you go.  Tomorrow we will go eat at a Polish restaurant with my family because we all love Polish food so much!  Pierogies here we come!!

      Kris got me so upset today I couldn't finish my lunch.  That is a first for me; being so upset I couldn't eat.  Usually I eat more when I am upset.  Boys suck.  Anyway, we didn't end up spending any time together after all b/c he was feeling sick again today.  I think it is because he hasn't been to the gym in a few days.  At least, I don't think he's been.  I think it helps him feel better when he does go. He came with me last night to my company party.  Unfortunately he wasn't feeling 100%, so he was not his usual bouncy, fun self.  We did have some fun after the party if you know what I mean. So I guess I was so upset with him today because he was doing something he has accused me of doing.  I don't appreciate double standards.  I know it was probably the steriods the doctors put him on; they make him cranky and irritable.  It's like talking to myself.  Now I know what it's like for him to deal with me.  What a great pair we make.  He is on those dumb 'roids and I have PMS. We are both cranky bitches!

      I should be in bed now!  So yah, I just realized that I had homework due tomorrow and I hadn't done any of it.  In under 2 hours I finished it and e-mailed it to my instructor.  The quality may not be 100% but in the mood I'm in I DON'T CARE.  I want to play on the computer all night.  But then I will be in bad shape at work tomorrow.  But guess what? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT EITHER.  Work sucks real bad.  I wore my pink White Sox hat today.  The Sox won.  The Cubs won.  All is right with the world.  Well, maybe not.  For this paragraph, I will not begin with "I."  In fact, I will cease to use that letter.   So, work sucked today and there was ths dumb meetng that lasted two hours. Twas dumb and went on too long.  N'fact, we got so off track, the orgnal topc was hardly mentoned after the frst half hour.  Fnally, me escaped the meetng at ten to fve and ran to the washroom, because boy me had to pee.  OK I will commence using the letter I again.  This is dumb.  So I got out of doing work for two hours.  The ironic part is that the meeting was about improving my efficiency.  Yikes.  Upon rereading this entry, the casual reader would probably not think I am very intelligent.  Sometimes, I think they may be right.

      The title says it all.  I had a yucky day at work.  Thankfully I was able to move on after 5pm.  I was trapped in a meeting for TWO HOURS.  Yuk Yuk Yuk.  There are so many things I would like to do right now.  There are so many things I  could  be doing now.  But somehow, I find myself glued to the computer.

      Guess what I did on Saturday...I went skydiving!!  It was so awesome. I was scared until right after I got out of the plane.  Freefalling is the most amazing feeling, once you get over the weirdness of your lips flapping in the 120 mph wind.  Much thanks to Troy out at  urlLink Skydive Chicago .  On Sunday, Kris, Charlie and I went downtown to check out the new Millennium Park.  The Bean is very cool.  We walked around a lot and ate at  urlLink Wildfire .  YUM is all I can say.  However, the next time we go, I will just eat appetizers and dessert and skip trying to cram an entree down my gullet.  So far this week, I have been a good girl.  I went to the gym everyday so far.  Hooray for me!

      OK Bubbles, here you go. A blog entry devoted to you.  Hope you feel special.  I go and sass Jocy on her LJ so I told her she could come here and sass me.  Bubbles, oops, I mean  Jocelyn , is Kris' sister and she is tons of fun.  We like to gang up on her unsuspecting family and friends and beat them at games like Cranium and Balderdash.  I don't see her very often so leaving saucy comments on her LJ is my only contact with her.

      Well Kris was released from the hospital on Monday.  Apparently he has Crohn's Disease as well as a peforated colon.  Sounds fun, huh?  So now he is on medications, steroids and supplements.  The combination makes him moody and agitated.  We were supposed to hang out tonight, (its called I friggin changed my plans and blew off my friends for him) but he is hanging out with his friends instead.  Poo on him. So life has not really slowed down.  I feel tired all the time, and quite irritable.  But that second part is not really unususal.  Why do I care about him so much?  Why do I want to be around him so much?  Why can't he read my mind and do what I want him to do?  Why does he have to be the typical dumb guy when it comes to girls and feelings?  Blecch.  To quote one of my favorite tee shirts, "Boys are smelly, throw lemons at them."

      What a whirlwind!  Here's the breakdown:  Friday night: I went out to the Winner's Circle bar out in Sycamore to hang out with Jenny and Joyce.  I drank too much and I ate too much popcorn.  Saturday morning: I woke up early and took the train in to the city.  I stopped at McDonald's to get the boys some breakfast.  Kris, Noel, Mike (Noel's friend from Tampa) and I ended up hanging out at Andy's condo for a while.  His roommate Danny is hilarious.  He tells the funniest stories in the funniest way.  Saturday afternoon: Since it was raining like it was the end of the world, we took a cab to the Hilton Towers (that was the surprise I didn't guess!  How awesome is that?!) and dried off in our room  (on the Executive Level, no less!)  then went down to eat in the restaurant. So, the Executive Level thing was pretty cool.  Kris said he didn't even ask to be put on the Executive Level, but he figured that the hotel personnel decided he deserved to be there.  Anyway, the EL privilege treated us to free hors d'oeuvres and breakfast the next morning.  Plus, we had a lake-view room.  The room was very posh, and had two beds and two bathrooms.  Saturday night: When the rain let up, we walked down to the Taste.  We met up with Tom, Ed, Sean, Pete, Mike, Roger and Karen and drank a lot of beer.  A  lot .  We even got some free beers!! Woo hoo!  The fireworks were awesome this year.  Last year, the fireworks were lame, and the show didn't last long.  But this year, the quality was excellent and the show lasted a long time.  We had some more beers, then the whole group kind of split up. Kris and I slipped up to the room for some alone time. Afterwards, we were hungry, so we went back to the restaurant we'd eaten at earlier for a late night snack.  When we finished, Kris and I wanted to head back up to the room...but when we got to the bank of elevators, we saw Tom with some girl we didn't know, and boy, was he puttin the mack on her!  They were waiting for an elevator to go up, so we detoured to some comfy chairs; we sat and chatted until we saw Tom and the girl walk past us.  When the coast was clear, Kris and I made our way back up to the room.  That is when things got fuzzy for me.  People came and went.  Some obnoxious girls showed up with Sean and Mike, but left after proclaiming us to be L-A-M-E lame.  I eventually fell asleep.  Sunday morning: I woke up to at least four other guys in the room, besides my boyfriend.  I was too tired and hungover to care who saw me in my bra and panties.  We were all kind of out of it.  We partook of the free breakfast, then collected our things and checked out.  Kris and I went back to his apartment with Noel and Mike.  Sunday afternoon: Kris and I wandered around the city with Noel and Mike before they had to fly back to Florida.  We stopped in to eat at Mr. Greek's.  We walked past the Sears Tower and just roamed.  The four of us ended up near the Taste, and sat down in a secluded area to smoke.  We sent Noel and Mike back to Florida, then Kris and I took a nap before we left for Wrigleyville.  Sunday night: We rode a VERY crowded train up north to Wrigley Field.  Kris and I met up with Tom, Ed, Sean and Pete and went in to find our seats.  Our seats were in the next to last row of the upper deck!  Pretty far from the action, but we had a great view.  Unfortunately, the Sox lost.  Since Kris, Ed and I were wearing Sox gear, we got heckled a little bit.  But we shook it off, and went to hide in a bar a bit away from the park.  After a few drinks at the Blarney Stone, we met up with Ed's friend at Casey Moran's.  Kris and I only had one drink apiece there, then headed back to his apartment.  Monday morning: Kris and I woke up around 9:30.  He fell back asleep, but I was wide awake and played some games on his computer.  We took a train back to the suburbs, and floated in the pool for a while.  Craig joined us, and the three of us soaked in the hot tub for a while.  Kris wasn't feeling 100%, so I went to get him some medicine.  Later, we made pancakes for supper.  Yum!  Tuesday afternoon: Kris called me around 3:30 today.  He was feeling even worse than yesterday, and the doctor he'd gone to sent him to the emergency room.  So I told him to call and keep me updated.  When I left work at 5, I went shopping to try to relax, but I was concerned about Kris.  I drove past his parents' house, but his mom's car was gone, so I went on to Central DuPage Hospital, and tracked them down. Basically, the doctor still doesn't know what exactly is wrong, and why.  So they are keeping him at least overnight, until some specialists can see him.  So I stayed with him and his mother until 10.  Then I stopped at Wendy's so I could finally eat!  So you see, it has been a whirlwind of activity, and I hope this coming weekend will be much calmer!

      Yesterday was FUN FUN FUN.  I had a great birthday.    Kris met me at the train station and we walked to the el.  We rode up to Wrigleyville and met up with the Smith boys.  After food and beer, we managed to get tickets into the Astros vs Cubs game.  In fact, Kris and I got awesome seats, behind home plate!  The Cubbies lost, but we had a great time.  The upper deck shaded our seats so we were out of direct sunlight. After the game, all of us made it back to Sluggers.  We had a few more beers and then Kris and I took the el back to Greektown and we ate at Giordano's. (I know, pasta and pizza in Greektown.  Weird.)    So, all in all, it was a successful day.  And by all accounts, this weekend will be even better.  We will brave the crowds at the Taste and watch the fireworks.  But the crowning glory of this weekend may just be the Sox vs Cubs game on Sunday. Yes, we have tickets. Kris was trying to keep it a secret, but I managed to guess.  However, he said there is still a surprise I don't know about.  Yippee!! I love surprises.  Well,  nice  surprises, anyway.

      So I should be completing my homework.  It is, after all, the final assignment for this class.  And it is due tomorrow.  Bah.  The ironic thing is that I just finished writing a short paper for this class on why employees shouldn't use the Internet for personal use while at work.  I feel very hypocritical.  OK, back to homework.
