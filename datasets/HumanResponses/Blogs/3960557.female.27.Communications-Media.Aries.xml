       THURSDAY , 14 NOVEMBER 2002 By MARIANNE BETTS Party drug Fantasy has killed a Lower Hutt man and left a Wellington woman seriously ill after two separate overdose incidents this week. The overdoses have prompted a fresh warning from police on the dangers of the illegal substance. The death of Grant Ferretti, 35, is believed to be the Wellington region's first fatal Fantasy overdose and the second in New Zealand. He died in Hutt Hospital on Tuesday after being admitted to the intensive care unit in a coma early on Monday. Detective Sergeant Glen Turner said police were called to Mr Ferretti's Seddon St home just after 5am on Monday, after being alerted to a "suspected drug overdose" by ambulance staff. Mr Ferretti, an ACC beneficiary, was in a coma when police arrived, Mr Turner said. There were nine other people at his Naenae home, some had been asleep and others intoxicated. Mr Ferretti shared the house with his girlfriend, Rachel Beeby, and another flatmate. Ms Beeby declined to comment last night. Mr Turner said police were still investigating the death and though it was a suspected Fantasy – or gammahydroxybutyrate – overdose, this had yet to be confirmed. Blood tests had been sent to the Environmental Science and Research Institute for analysis but results would not be available for a few days. Nor were the results of an autopsy done yesterday available yet. Mr Turner said Fantasy was being taken by a broad cross-section of people, and was particularly popular with partygoers and nightclubbers who failed to realise its potential danger. "There's quite a bit out there and it is readily available. It is used among not just the criminal fraternity but all parts of society," he said. Fantasy was outlawed as a class B drug this year. Auckland University student Shawn Brenner died last year after taking Fantasy. St John Ambulance bosses told a conference last month that the biggest worry for paramedics was ravers on Fantasy who went into deep states of unconsciousness after overdosing. Fantasy – increasingly being linked to date rapes and deaths – is the most common cause of drug poisoning seen at Auckland Hospital, where staff treat 10 to 14 patients a weekend. Mr Turner said the drug, which came in a clear liquid form, was usually mixed with drinks. A Wellington Hospital spokeswoman said a woman was admitted in a serious condition to the intensive care unit on Saturday night, but was discharged from hospital on Tuesday. The spokeswoman said Fantasy overdoses were becoming more common, with emergency doctors treating one or two on most weekends. Hutt Hospital emergency department head Don Mackie said though there were very few Fantasy admissions, there had been a sharp increase in patients with psychosis induced by amphetamine (speed). "We are getting one or two a week, but a year ago we got one a month."
