      Today i am as sore as a virgin/my muscles are tight/aching like mini fists are punching my buttcheeks everytime i take a step/it all started when he crept/into my bed last night/as i slept, with no fight/i felt a small tingle as he slowly crawled under the sheets/already feeling intense heat/no fan would cool me down/that erection was pussy bound/my legs softly spread open, his hands slide down to meet in the middle/his tongue brushes lightly to start off the wiggle/of my hips when they start to grind/techniques of pleasure, he knows the kind/ making sure the landing strip is ready/he enters the runway, nice and steady/he pounded and hit that spot/sweatin in my sleep cuz the shit was hot/I went to sleep with my favorite pink pj's/this is what i get for liking dj's?/mixing juices and juggling my hills/lickin his fingers cuz he likes how it feels/i found myself naked and kissing my knees while he held my ankles as I whispered "please"/if this was a dream, i didn't want it to stop/pussy so wet you'd need a mop/that one last stab stuck as far as can go/felt so good I couldn't say no/and we came/oh man that shit was insane!/ended it with a soft peck/i felt his panting hot breath on my neck/i sighed towards the skies/i woke up this morning staring into his eyes/with him asking what the smile is for/i get up towards the bathroom door/i played a mean game of volleyball yesterday, and I'm still sore.

      Are there times where you feel like you need to hold something? Maybe you feel lonely and you just need something to hold to make you feel better? Something precious...something valuable to you...something you love? I've been in that situation before but I think I finally found something that would take that yearning away...a virgin.   urlLink Virgin Threads  has come out with a line of clutches that will make heads turn to say "whhhhhhhaaaaaa?!?!?!?!" "Ohhhhh Guuuurl!!!" Maybe it's the simple design.. maybe its the dope ass colors... who cares... I think they are HOT!  Here's a joke:  Why did the mushroom go to the party? Answer:  Cuz he was a fungi (get it Fun guy?) HAHAHAH!!!

       Sometimes I wake up in the mornings and wonder what the hell I am going to do that day.  Why is it that I have to devote my days to looking for jobs so that I can make money so that I can get my own house and grow up and have a family and then raise them and then blah blah blah and then die?  I wish I can just get up at 10am-11am everyday and watch tv and go outside and play with my friends and watch tv all day until my parents come home so that they can give me money that they earned so that I can be happy.  All I needed back when I was a kid was a whole dollar so that I can walk to the corner store and get some candy and play a game of street fighter.  Why, you ask, am I all of a sudden telling you all of this?  Well today I spent the day at a park with a bunch of kids...played a dope ass volleyball game and kicked the living daylights out of a bunch of grown ups.  My game was interrupted by a request from my aunt that I go deliver some food for her..."Damn, I'm playing dammit can't you see?"  I wish I could just say that but...being that I have to set a good example to my little cousins and be a good representative of my family...I spiked the ball in my aunt's direction to make her jump and happily went on my merry way to run her errand. But in my head the whole time was...I wish I could have played another game of volleyball...catch...touch football...kickball! for heaven's sake!  But noOOOooOooO... I had to be a darling and help out. OK!!!!  I know I may be a princess...but... you call me princess like it's a bad thing?!?!?      On another note...I won't be posting my rhymes up everyday. I will however post a new somethin somethin every Friday... just a little rhyme to get you through the weekend... so check it out at the end of every week for some new lyrics. Peace &amp; Blessings folks!

      As I sit in front of the TV at my cousins house...the TV is turned on to MTV. Every 30 seconds a commercial comes on advertising the 2004 Video Music Awards that is happening in Miami, Florida on August 29th at 8:00pm. Nice plug aye? Anyways, I just wanted to let all of my blog readers know that thanks to my boyfriend's plug with  urlLink MP3.com , I will be writing my first freelance feature about celebrity fashion at the VMA's. So be on the lookout for it on MP3.com!  On another note...I went to Costco today...can I get a "whatttuppp" for Costco though?? As I walked through their snacks aisle I spotted my favorite snack (well for now that is).. it's the nature valley trail mix fruit n nut (gotta have the nut) bars. For 35 bars it was $7.79 and when I bought them at Safeway a couple days back...I got 6 bars for $3.99. Now how you gonna go and do that? Thereforeartthou, when I finish the remaining 4 bars that I have, I will be taking a trip (with my mom of course cuz she got the cash) back to Costco to take advantage of this wonderful deal!  That's all for now folks...but before I go I'd like to say peace to all the fighting couples out there...don't go away mad... just go away.

       i was asked to write a sample of my writing... anything..something off the top of my head. so, i sit down with my pen and pad and draw blanks. i found myself doing something.. well, that i always do but never found the reason to write about it until now...so imma share:    i feel an itch in my leg/shaking the glitter off my chinese slipper/mind in motion but not as fast as my leg/it's runnin marathons but at a standstill/my head bobbin and now my head starts finding the rhythm, feelin ants in them/making dance grooves/then my head counter moves/one swaying to neo-soul and the other moving to rave-like techno/slowly building it up/faster to climax high speed beats like I'm racing/It's 2 fast 2 furious in my pant legs/pumpin so fast my heel loses sporadic contact with the floor for fast repitition/my eyes are getting tired just watching it move/I'm getting nauseous because I'm dizzy/Nervous? Anxious?/Sitting and thinking/writing what's in my head before I forget it/I look like a crack feind waiting for her next freebase session/I'm about to take off and my legs are my shuttle thrusters about to launch/T-minus 10 seconds and counting.
