      I have figured it out. I am a strong Christian, there fore UNT must be the devil, because they are out to get me. I finally got that stupid jerk of a professor to give me a code to get into the LAST CLASS I NEED FOR GRADUATION! That's right. One class - an ENTIRE semester for ONE CLASS!! UGH! So I am trying to register online (because that is the only way they will allow it now) but for some reason, when they disallowed teleregistration, the made the online registration next to impossible. I have emailed the help desk about 150 times. And finally I wrote them an email a second ago where I complained profusely about the incompetence of the web site (in which case to make the whole thing a bit less bitchy, I added "maybe it is me that is incompetent...But I have an excuse; I haven't BEEN ABLE TO GET A COLLEGE DEGREE YET, SINCE I CAN'T REGISTER FOR A FREAKING CLASS!!!!!!!), I keep getting this error message that says I need an enrollment appointment. So what, I have to make an appointment to register online??!?!?! This is retarded!!!!!! I am so sick of this school. I have not had one good experience there...Except for the parties...And the boys...And the alcohol....And the really funny stories at the oaks swimming pool where the cops knew our names...Somehow...Maybe I just won't register. Maybe I will just maintain my seniority and be a UNT senior forever. I am SO selling my house and moving back to the graveyard estates on I.O.O.F. street.... because i am in a ranting mood - why in the world is my water bill $140.00???? that is outrageous. for an entire year i have paid exactly 31.18 per month and then BOOM! i am hit with bills reaching almost $150.  am i paying for my entire street? is that the deal? for a year one person has to pay for the whole neighborhood? donations welcome. just give me an email and let me know you are serious about giving me money and i will send you details on my water account number for you to feed cash into immediately.

      Why didn't I think of this?  urlLink MSNBC - Munch’s famous ‘Scream,’ ‘Madonna’ stolen . Anyone want to go to the DMA with me this weekend? We can pick up a few renaissance paintings.... This dude just walked in threw a gun in the air AND WALKED RIGHT BACK OUT (!!!!!!!!!!!!) with two edvard munch paintings!!! That is ridiculous. The same thing has happened in 1988 and 1994, in which case the then thief claims he had no involvement saying, 'weapons are not my style. I have always used the methods of a gentleman'' that is hilarious. Also, go see  Open Water . Woah. I could go on for days about that flick.... I had been needing to see a scary movie for at least two months, and sorry Bobby that retarded movie you brought over to try and get me to like you, was lame....Not scary in the least. But THIS movie....I went from clawing off my face, to gauging out my eyes, to not being able to breath, to throwing up in my mouth a little bit (that last part was a joke). It was INCREDIBLE!!!! Obviously, I will preach it's gospel 'till the day I die.

      so last weekend i went to a fashion design party in downtown dallas on the roof of the American Beauty Mill. first of all, this building is in the sketchy-est part of Dallas right by the fair grounds in amongst a bunch of wharehouses and in the shipping yards. CREEEPY!!! in order to get to the building, i had to drive up a railroad track in Satan Saturn. i was terrified! so when i walk into this post modernism industrial concoction and the place has all the origional manlifts and firedoors and industrial lighting and staircases, you can imagine all the quotes we were popping from horror flicks ("omg ya'll! dont leave me alone in the elevator it will lock down and then the walls will start bleeding and i will be eaten alive" and "these stairs are NOT created for my four inch Millani pumps, so i KNOW that as soon as we crawl onto the roof the electricity will go out and the spirits will chase us down - only for us to fall and, not only ruin a great pair of heels, but i could break a leg, in which case i will trip over the railing and get my head hung in the manlift cables and dangle to a horrific death") maybe i have an active imagination???? i digress...in the foyer of the building, there is a glassed off area that has a huge steel firedoor that has caution signs all over it...according to the nightman, it is the doorway to the infamous urban myth tunnell that runs all the way to Deep Ellum....::insert scary music here:: so after much debate on how the door is really a passage way to Hell, my friends kosher amy, jennifer, really hot dude, intoxicated friend, and the non-threatening gay neighbors decide that next week we are going to dress up in festive wear (obviously non-threatening gay neighbors' idea to wear 'festive' outfits) and we are going to try to make it all the way to Deep Ellum through the American Beauty Mill tunnel.....so. having said this, if you don't hear from me ever again....contact some authorities because chances are the skeletons that are buried in the walls of the cave have gotten us.....i am so STINKIN' excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      a friend of mine just said, "I WANT YOU TO KNOW I VALUE OUR FRIENDSHIP, NO MATTER HOW YOUNG IT IS."  isn't that something all friends should say to each other? a little humble decree of positive emotions should not be so hard to display to someone that you honestly do care about. nothing negative could possibly come from that. only good things. but then again....it is so hard to just throw yourself out there sometimes... funny how it is simpler to tell a complete stranger something nice rather than a friend, or family.   maybe vulnerability isn't such a bad thing....
