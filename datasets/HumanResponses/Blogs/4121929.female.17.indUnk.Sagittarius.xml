      byAshlee Simpson  On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you In the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me(x2)  I am moody, messy I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen Make me happy, it's your mission And you won't stop till I'm there Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast When I hit that bottom, crash, you're all I have  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away... yeah  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  [Chorus:] Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myselfI love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tellAll the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...(x2)

       by Chantal Kraviazuk  Somethin' in your eyes, makes me wanna lose myself Makes me wanna lose myself, in your arms There's somethin' in your voice, makes my heart beat fast Hope this feeling lasts, the rest of my life If you knew how lonely my life has been And how long I've been so alone And if you knew how I wanted someone to come along And change my life the way you've done  It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I come from It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  A window breaks, down a long, dark street And a siren wails in the nightBut I'm alright, 'cause I have you here with me And I can almost see, through the dark there is light Well, if you knew how much this moment means to me And how long I've waited for your touch And if you knew how happy you are making me I never thought that I'd love anyone so much  It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way the back where I come from It feels like home to me, it feels like home to me It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong It feels like I'm all the way back where I belong
