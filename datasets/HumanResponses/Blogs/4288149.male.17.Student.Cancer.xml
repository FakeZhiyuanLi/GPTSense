      Ah, here I am again, typing after YF.  Today I went to see  The Village  with Andy, and I thought it was absolutely ace.  I won't tell you the story, but basically it's a psychological thriller about a village surrounded by a forest containing scary monsters! You scared? I thought you were, you wimp.  Yup, not a lot happened today apart from that. Um. Yeah. So that's it. Bye!

       Today's quote:      "To make a mythological creature, all you have to do is add wings to a normal animal, and it becomes imaginary. A lion becomes a griffin, a horse becomes Pegasus, and a hawk becomes...a double hawk"               - Demitri Martin  Well that was a fun night. I arrived an hour early for the show, so I went to Fopp, bought  a slightly interesting book, read it in Starbucks for a while to pass the time, then returned the book. Very sneaky. Demitri Martin was interesting. He's American so has a different sense of humour, therefore having different stage qualities to British comedians. He was pretty funny, but not as good as someone like Bill Bailey or Ross Noble.  Afterwards I went round to John and Matthew's and we had a little birthday thing for John with some of the other YFers. Then Stephen turned up with all the Banchory people. So there were about 20 of us crammed into John's living room, so we went into the paddock to play football. Until 3:30AM. Then I walked home. I'm tired.  Hmmm. Good things and bad things are happening right now:   Good:  I ordered a box of boosters from the Champions of Kamigawa set for £45, which is £1.25 per booster, which is quite nice. 6th Year is coming up. I got some more Pratchett books.   Bad:  I don't know whether I can go to the Papashaw bowling invitational, because of the 6th year buddies program, which I have to stay on at school an hour for on Tuesday to help organise. Grr. I can't go to Stephen's gig because I have to babysit my brother. Oh well, at least I'm getting paid. I can't go and see the Mad Caddies because it's in Glasgow on a school night. Aaarrghhh!  Ok, well that's it for now, but thanks for reading this far.  - Tom

      Well, hello. Welcome to my ramblings. I'm going to try and write in this at least every other day. But that  will  be quite hard.  This holiday has been rather fun.   To the max?   No, not yet, but I have yet to experience the final few days. To sum this summer holiday up in a sentence:  I went to Majorca and to London and to a wedding and to Amsterdam and to some fringe shows and I got some satisfactory qualifications. There. Who says grammer and punctuation is essential? You understood that, didn't you?  Last night I went to see Marcus Brigstocke at the fringe. What a legend. You know, the guy from that program 'We Are History'. No? Well his website's here:  urlLink www.marcusbrigstocke.com . Oh, and also, when I came back after the show to unlock my bike, someone had nicked my saddle. Typical. You think your bike's safe, locked up in the middle of Edinburgh, at night, in a crowded street, when the festival is on and......oh. I'm stupid. What annoys me is that they didn't even have the sense to use the quick release - they just snapped the mechanism and swiped the seat. Stupid criminals.  Well, tonight I'm going to see Demitri Martin at the fringe. Very kind senor Tom McNeill gave me a ticket - huzzah! Should be good.  I also have started on my personal statement for UCAS. I'll stop there, because it's already getting boring.   Today, I have mostly been playing:  Final Fantasy 7 The Curse of Monkey Island   I have mostly been listening to:  Voices of Violence by Billy Talent River Below by Rilly Talent Back in Black by AC/DC  Well, until my next post, keep it...um...real, i guess. Not that it's possible to stop being real.
