      YaY! i went to the races last nite w/ dad and it was awesome! skip did ok. he had a new car that was running fast but not fast enough to  beat colin northway....but thats ok he still did really good in my opinion....then dad and went down to the pits and i saw skip and looked at his car again LoL! and then bought another shirt this time for M.B. and had skip sign it and yeah that was about all we did down in the pits and then i asked my dad if we could party w/ the people but he said no. before we even went into the grandstand dad let me get stickers that you put on your car and i got two of them...a sprintcar and then one thats says "Im that girl your dad warned you about" they had a whole bunch of really cute sayings there was this one that i wanted to get that said "my dad's faster than your dad" just reall cute little things like that.  in the 410's Colin Nothway won and in the 360's Billy Alley won. they are both really super fast racers and only beginners too! last nite was the last nite of sprintcar racing and knoxville for the season now i have to wait til april.....grrr! skip will be going over to austrailia to race like he normally does...or well he should be going over but i havent heard....i was going to ask him if i could have one of his  urlLink tearoffs  and he sign it for me but i never did b/c that would odd....i think tearoffs are cool! hehehe....yeah i know im strange but they neat! ok well ima gonna go and eat something.

      Last nite was the game and we lost but we did good i think. i actually saw like a whole play where cj almond got a touchdown that was pretty cool and then i also saw another touchdown but i cant remeber who got that one but yeah i was so excited that i was yelling and screaming and wow it was awesome. then i saw and heard the impact when a midget and one of our players...cant remember who but they collided and i saw it and heard it and yeah they was hovering over both of them for a long time then our player got up and that a good thing but the other player was put on one of those board things and put in the ambulance. after we performed the national anthem for pre-game fireworks went off and that was really cool too i turned around to look even though we werent spose too then when we made the tunnel and football players ran through they had really cool like pyros that went off on either side of them as they ran through...it was so cool! oh and when we got a touchdown everytime the also had fireworks go off. itwas just way cool i though....whoo-hoo!   me and sarah went to the dance just b/c and partly b/c of something else but anyways we went it was super lame but we stayed til like 12:10 and then i drove her home and i went home and yeah it was really lame like last year but hey its homecoming why not go? there wasnt a whole lot of ppl there either....i didnt see any football or cheerleaders there so im assuming they had another party and yeah.  tomorrow i have a master class to attend for all-state preparations and i've never gone so i dont really know what expect. it think it'll be fun though.

      life is so funny at times. we got the computer game of life and we'd land on certain things that would somehow be related to my life. for example europe. if you are wondering why im home and not in school its b/c see i was at school then came home before classes even started...for some reason when i was walking into school i could barely walk my back hurt really bad and yeah it still does so i think ima gonna go sit some more on the heating pad...im really mad b/c i wanted to be in school today..its a gorgeous day to be in school and besides i wanna know whats goin on w/ the band thanks to dan blair.   here are lyrics to a song that i absolutly love:   Britney Spears   Everytime  Come notice me And take my hand So why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...

      the past few days/nites i've been in bed by 9:30 and normally 10:30-11 is when i go to bed but anyway my point is is that one nite i just crashed on the couch for a few mins while watching tv and the other nite i just went downstairs to bed and didnt even watch tv which is very odd for me. so last nite i went to bed and slept but i had a very weird vivid dream only now i cant remember it b/c im trying to remember it only this morning when i awoke at like 9:30 i was telling my dad the highlights of it even though he could care less but yeah so if i remember i'll write about it. but then last nite i also woke up which is i guess normal for me i mean i wake up at least once every nite but last nite i woke up at least 2 times but then i had trouble falling back to sleep and normally i dont when i wake in the middle of the nite but all i know is that my sleeping habits have been a litte screwy lately.   i've slowly been changing my  urlLink site . i've started a  blend challenge . and i made a new layout and i've also been making and posting blends. i think i might start making brushes and post them.

      so last nite i decided to spend that nite at my grandparents house...yes i still do, i enjoy spending time w/ them and being on a farm outside getting,   "Gasp!" dirty!  . anywho so today i woke at 10 and then watched a movie,  Seabiscuit . I like that movie i've seen it several time and its just neat...then i took a shower. Before i went outside i ate some lunch then went out to mow the pasture. my goal this summer is to mow the whole thingy by  myself  but everytime i attempt it either grandpa comes out and helps or my dad. today i told grandpa i wanted to do it myself so then dad came out w/ his other lawnmower which is the new one and its awesome! it has power steering...anywho m.b. mowed w/ me. while i was mowing today i decided to work on my tan so i put on my swimming suit and mowed. im a little pinkish which is good. so now im home and i just downloaded two songs:  Gigalo  - nick cannon and r. kelly and  tear it up  - yung won, DMX, David Banner, and Lil Flip. i still like my rock music and pop music but now im into the r&b and rap thing.

      last nite i didnt do anything b/c we had to run to ft. dodge to give my dad his spare set of keys b/c he locked the ones he had in his van then we went and ate out. my mother made me drive and it wasnt that bad. so today this morning it was like 9 something and m.b wakes me up ands like  "...we got to go to ft. dodge and give dad this black box thing...."  so i got up and got dressed. there was no time for me to shower. i had to drive the truck b/c mom took my car this morning since the little kitten were out in the garage this morning and they wouldnt come in so like i said i had to take the truck...we got the box thingy in the truck, yes it took both of us to lift and push it to the truck door..it was heavy then we left and met him at starlight dropped it off then left and came home. on our way there though we saw two cop cars at this one intersection and i was like whats goin on well there was this dude who was dressed in a black and white horizontal lined once piece outfit or uniform...i didnt know they still wore those things..anywho i dont exactly know what was goin on but they were talkin to him and stuff...it was interesting. so now im home and finally im clean and now im on the puter...but now i need to go and do my chores.

       i remember ! i read a post by zach and he said he watched timeline. ok so i also watched the movie timeline, over the weekend and i also watched  Cold Creek Manor .  Cold Creek Manor  thats what i couldnt remember. its a good  mystery  movie! i liked it but some people might be like   "...oh it was so fake..."   in the middle of the movie you will know who is the bad guy and so then after that the movie kind of drags along but other than that its pretty good. i dont know if i'd want to buy it but definately i'd like to see it again. and oh, we get  SHREK 2  on friday!!!!!

      im always forgetting things. i was going to blog about something but now i cant remember. i was thinking about it yesterday and how it'd be a good thing to write about but its now today and i cant remember. sometimes i just dont pay close attention to things to remember and sometimes i truly just forget completely. today lindsay wanted me to get her a pop b/c i was going down to get myself one and i was walking along then my mind wandered off then i saw beth and i was like "..im spose to tell you something about kelsey and a pop..." see kelsey asked me to tell beth something about her pop if i saw and i saw beth but yeah. so anyways i continue my to the vending machines, i get there and get my pop then i cant remember what im spose to get lindsay so i walk clear back down to the french room to ask her again what i was spose to get her. i felt so stupid. and see i guess there really isnt any excuse for me forgetting about what kelsey told me....anywho if i remember i'll write.  breaking news  my grandpa is going to a nursing home! i have to go see whats goin on.

      today just never ended...3rd period just kept going i thought it would never end and then after that just all my classes forever! now im  finally  home. i've had an exhausting day but, i didnt do anything really to make it exhausting. tomorrow will be  awesome !!! im leaving after band, then im just going home and will there til 3. there is really no point for me to even go to school tomorrow b/c here is my schedule for tomorrow: 1.  math  - n/t to serious there 2.  History  - crossword puzzle 3.  Indepent Study in Music  - i will be going to  studyhall  which im happy about 4.  Band  - ugh! we have to play 5.  Studyhall  - i actually have a studyhall that im spose to be in 6.  French  - i will again be going to  studyhall . we dont have class 7.  Phy Ed  - we'll probably weightlift so see there is no point to going to school tomorrow. moving on...i did learn something today though...i learned how to use some of the weightlifting equip. today. i cant lift very much but at least i can do it. i can lift anywhere between 50 and 80 for my arms. 80 is pushing it though and my legs i think anywhere between 30 and 60. lets talk about lunch...guys are  asses  especially the ones who sit w/ sarah and i. we do not have to take any of that crap! today really got to me and for the first time it was also directed toward me and i listened and it really hurt me. normally they just make fun of sarah and say really cruel things and laugh in her face and i always told her to not let it get to her but today it got to me. i really dont understand why they needed to rag on us i mean we didnt do anything to deserve what they said to us.  band...i needed to go to a mental institution  only for today during that period. too much  flute  this and that! ahhh! i wish school would just be done w/!

      so i just got done watching the  urlLink  one tree hill   season finale. i've followed the show since the pilot episode. tonite was so good! ok so the ending took me for a complete loop b/c when you see trailers they make you think something and the trailer for tonites episode was so good that is made you think something else.  (sorry to confuse you if you read this but i understand what i mean.)   im going to tell you some big highlights:  1.) Haley and Nathan got  MARRIED!   2.) Ravens lose their season championship game for basketball 3.) Dan has a heart attack and then the whole niki thing that was awesome!  Wow! those were some big twists and turns they were so awesome! i cant wait til next season.

       Friday : we had large group contests in Forrest City. I thought we did really good but i guess not as good as i thought we got a 2 rating. the other band, 9-10 got a 3 rating which is just unbelievable b/c i thought they did better than what they did at the parade of bands. anywho back to my band we played really good i thought but yes there were some mistakes but overall i thought it was good. my solo-sih trio-ish part i sort of goofed up on in this one measure where i always mess up on but i dont think it was that noticable.   Saturday : i had a wedding reception to go to which was a total complete boring time. the food was good but it was super boring. dad and i didnt go to the races which i guess is ok but  tony stewart  was at knoxville i guess, supposedly.  Sunday : i went out to my grandparents house for a lunch type of thing and laura and my little cousins were there. it was grand. i went out to the pasture and hit a baseball around then i lost it and couldnt find so i looked forever til i found it and i did then stopped and decided to mow the pasture. i got a nice sunburn. dad looks like a LOBSTER! ha!

      last nite dad and i went to  urlLink  knoxville   it was awesome! the  urlLink  World Of Outlaws   were there and they combined friday's races w/ last nites racing b/c of the weather on friday nite.  urlLink  Skip Jackson   now racing 2x who is my favorite racer did pretty well last nite. His first lap time trial was  16.200  and second lap time trial not as fast  16.254  that currently put him in the 4th fastest time spot but we still had 55 time trials left and after all of them he was 11th fastest Skip  was in 410 Heat # 3. He started in the second row on the outside which put him starting 4th out of 12. He came in 7th. He then started in the 410 B-Main. He was in the third row inside which put him starting 5th out of 21. He came in 5th and that ended his nite. Only the top 4 would transfer to the A-Main.  The fastest time trial of the nite was made by Chad Kemenah with the first lap time trial being 15.832 and second time trial lap being 15.851.  There were some crashes and my second favorite driver  ricky logan  crashed in the B-Main. i saw the whole thing from the moment its happened to the end. i saw that it was going to happen he got over the cushion and collided w/ the wall then he flipped like literally at least 5 times before landing on the ground. he was ok. another crash was erin crocker she hit the wall too but was fine. Jeff Mitrisin also had a pretty bad crash his was i think the first or second one of the nite and he's pretty good. Skip also hit the wall but it was nothing serious. they just had to push him away from the wall and he was off again only he had to start in the back of the pack. we didnt get home til a little after  5am . but it was worth it the racing was incrediable. also i forgot in the 360's there were a lot of first timers and there was this 16 year old kid who it was his first time ever in a sprint and he'd never raced anythig not even a go-kart and he made it to the 360 A-Main. he hit the wall but was fine and there were 2 laps left and he had to start at the back of the pack but he passed two cars in those two laps so im guessing that he'll be pretty good.

      OMG! me and dad went to the world of outlaws again last nite! AMAZINGLY OUTSTANDING! it was the best i've ever seen. anywho it was really awesome and im just going to get to the point.  SKIP JACKSON  was  UNSTOPPABLE!  so he did good at the qualifying thing last nite he started in the  A-FEATURE  which is the main race. he was  DEAD LAST  in the line-up. there were some crashes, some people ran out of fuel etc...nothing to bad though there were only a couple restarts then we got down to the last two laps. its was so tense.  SKIP  was right there racing w/  DANNY LASOSKI  who is awesome by the way i love him too anywho skip didnt win but in my book he won b/c heres the thing ok the first place driver, mark kinser well they have to weigh the car to make sure he could win and he was  UNDERWEIGHT!  ha....and before that was announced skip came in  4TH PLACE!  but after that being announced skip came in   3RD PLACE  . so last nite he went from   DEAD LAST   to  a   3RD PLACE finish  . you had to be there...congratulations to my favorite driver!

      so today was my first day of work. i know once i get use to the people and get the hange of it all i'll enjoy it, just give the rest of my life to learn it. no so today i went to mcdonalds at 11 then i get there and im like yeah im here for laurie and blah blah blah...so then she puts me on a computer after introducing me to the people in the break room. so im on the computer for 3 hours! yeah i was basically learning the cash register...its kind of fun doing the exercises w/ taking pretend orders and placing them, if you can remember the large orders. For the most part its kind of easy w/ the cash register but just dont ask me to make it special, start over, take something away, add something, or move fast. i can do everything else just not those mentioned above. i met some really cool people but see i met them but i cant remember their names....this one guy he was pretty cool, he likes sprint car racing too, and he's even been to slideways and said its awesome and he said he's also going to knoxville this weekend. then there was this one girl she was friendly and really cool...she looks really familiar but i cant remember her name...but she's really cool. ok so anyway when i was finally done on the puter i had about an hour to start actually interacting w/ customers. this gal sara who is much older than me she was helping me...all i had to do was tell the people how much it was then they give me the money then i touch the screen w/ the amount they gave me and press another button the drawer open i give back the dollars and change thingy give me the exact amount. i suppose if you are anybody but me you could handle this simple task. ok so i did ok but i made some little errors and then some stupid errors and then some just plain duh errors. sara was really nice about when i goofed up. geez, it was so obvious it was my first day. i do look forward to tomorrow i just hope they let me do what i did today so i can get the hang of it.  there is one small problem...change...pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters. i've never handled money before and when they give me change i freak b/c i dont know if its the exact amount or what so then you have me here and im trying to count it and they're waiting for there change if there was any and ugh, so sara told me what i might want to do is "practice". which its not stupid its a good idea that im going to do tonite.   so ima gonna go and uh, eat lunch b/c i sort of skipped that meal b/c of the puter.

      over the weekend we rented movies. we rented  Peter Pan  and  Win A Date With Tad Hamilton  and two other various movies. The peter pan movie was amazing! the musical score which was composed by  James Newton Howard  was just awesome! the music was  magical . i really like this movie and so its on my list of movies to buy, but since my birthday is coming up its on my birthday list so maybe i wont have to buy it after all who knows. anyways back to movies we then rented win a date w/ tad hamilton. that movie was good. i dont know if i want to buy it or what but i'd like to see it again...there were some hilarious parts to it. i suggest you see both movies for those of you who do read my blog...if there are any people.  on to other news...i guess i'll be working at McDonald's this summer...im kind of excited but yet im not. one good thing about this job is that the manager is my aunt but yes she'll treat my like the rest but im family...anywho i best be going.

      my 4th was ok...i dont like marching but i had to. after i was done i marching and my mom and sis got done we left. when we got home my relatives came and we had a bonfire and played some basketball then we did some of our own fireworks and then watched the fireworks which in my opinion they werent very good and didnt last long. i was very disappointed.  onto racing, saturday i wanted to go to the races but dad was like you didnt get off work early and blah blah blah. i was off at 3 and he could have came and just picked me up from work and went straight from there but no and of course we missed an amazing race.  Skip Jackson  has been awesome this year and running the low part of the track and saturday he did it again only this time he took  1st  and there was no way of catching him. so that should put him in first place at knoxville for points!!! you can go to knoxvilleraceway.com and read the article.

      i've been w/ out internet for 7 days and now finally have it back. we switched from trv to mediacom. whatever we have is spose to be faster than what we had before which was dsl and when downloading a song its completely noticable but when surfing the net its not that noticable except for when you go to a site that use to take awhile to load like kcci.com but now it loads way faster.   yesterday i got my paycheck...its was 180$ and some odd cents. i worked last nite for like 3 hrs then matt was like do you want to go home so i left. lately i've been getting off an hour or two early. last nite was completely dead though....we had n/t to do so we'd stock cups and stuff. there were only like 8 or so of us working last nite so we had to take over two tasks. i presented and did drinks for drive-thru which is ok on a really slow until you get a slow rush of ppl then it sucks but yeah anywho i'll write about my 4th later and now ima gonna go.

      so i've realized that my summer has been a big boring event. all i do i sleep, work, and computer. i only maybe gone to the movie once or twice this summer and that was w/ my mother...im pathetic!   vacation was wonderful like i said before. im glad to be home for the civilization aspect of it but i'd like to go back now for the quietness and doing whatever you want part.  i work tonite, ugh! tomorrow is going to suck a whole lot b/c im working from 11 - 7. i've never ever worked that many hours in a day! but its all thanks to the new system thingy that does the schedules and sort of puts you at random w/ random hours.  i can hardly wait for next thursday friday saturday and sunday! whoo-hoo! ima going to jordan creek center shopping! hopefully i can find some jeans, shirts, shoes etc... when we went to mall of america none of us that went bought anything. my dad bough bill clintons book for my mom but that was about it. he was the only one who actually bought something karen and them didnt even buy anything.  sarah came over to our resort one day and we just layed around by the pool and i taught her how to play skip-bo. their cabbin is really nice. it gorgeous inside. i really like it. getting to her cabin was easy it wasnt as hard as what you'd think...you just have to know where you're going and what your're looking for i guess.  im going to have to post some pictures from vacation or something on here...maybe i'll just put them up on my personal website and you view them there. i dont know what im going to do with pictures yet...
