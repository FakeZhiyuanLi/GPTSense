       Sunday, visiting my brother and his family while they were keeping an eye on the in-laws smallholding, the horses decided to go for a little visit to the front garden.  It appears that the horses have figured out how to open gates.  They were quite merrily rolling in the flower beds when we discovered them.  Now how to get them back into their camp without a rope to lead them?  My brothers idea was to chase them with a stick.  The horses do have a very averse reaction to sticks.  No he didn't hit them, just waved the stick around a bit and boy did that set them off galloping.  I was standing quite relaxed at the corner of the house to stop them from running around the house again when horse number 1 decided to play chicken. Never play chicken with a horse!  They're big and powerfull and fast!  I had my adrenalin rush for the month *chuckle*.  Lucky for me the horse stopped about 1 meter from me and gave me the eye before taking another gallop around the front garden.    I was holding the little minuture duchhound in my arms through the whole thing and she had barked so much that her voice was gone.  This is just the cutest little dog you've ever seen.  Once the horses were back in their camp and I put her down, she ran over to the fence and started barking at the horses again.  This tiny little dog was quite prepared to take on the horses.  What she lacks in size she makes up for in personality.  Then of course the best thing about visiting family on a sunday is having a sis-in-law that cooks a proper sunday lunch! *happy sigh*

       OK, so I've been thinking that I need to rename this blog, again.  I'm a woman you see and I love rearranging things without warning or reason :)

       what happened to monday? I blinked and the day was gone.  It must be that time of the year, after new year and before christmas.  Compared to the time between christmas and new year which is absolutely lovely.  Now back to reality and the todo list : mow the lawn (6 weeks overdue) wash the dogs (2 years overdue) buy furniture for the empty rooms (1 year overdue) fix the rising damp (8 months overdue) buy a new car (7 months overdue)  *sigh*

       We got it!  I was driving in my car when the news came that we've won the bid for the soccer world cup 2010.  People were honking their car hooters, waiving their arms in the air, waving their arms in the air while hanging on to their bottles of beer.  Amazing that one little event can generate this much enthusiasm.  Then when I got home, all the news revolved around the bid, playbacks of who said what when and to whom.  This was when my enthusiasm for the whole thing increased by leaps and bounds.  They are promising to improve the road infrastructure in Sandton!!! ...

       For me, there's nothing as challenging as having to get up early on a friday morning when winter is setting in.  I have 3 alarms for this purpose, but this morning it did not help much.  Whoever invented the snooze button should either be shot or given an award.  Now that I'm at work and my one and only meeting for the day has been concluded I'm seriously considering some "retail therapy".  Seeing as the guys are off to play golf and I am so not going to be stuck in the office on my own.  It's times like these that I play with the idea to actually learn how to play golf ... not!  I just do not get the fascination with golf.  Walking around for hours with a stick and a little ball? Digging in ditches, crawling in the long grass, ducking as a golf ball zooms past? I can think of quite a number of things that are more relaxing .....

       To comment on a comment about the cost of a middle class home. Mike :) I do live in South Africa Let's see ...  for R460 000 you can get a 2 bedroomed house, 1 bathroom, kitchen/lounge/living area (150 square meters for the whole house) and a double car port (not garage).  In an "average neighbourhood" that happens to be 2 blocks away from the highway.  At least this means I can get on the highway in less than 15 minutes.  If I close my eyes at night I can imagine the sounds of traffic whizzing past is the sound of waves ;>  This compared to the house I grew up in, with my dad being a civil servant (4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, huge).  The good old days *sigh*  The security options are not really options since this affects the cost of my monthly insurance.  If the electric fence and alarm was actually connected directly to the offices of the armed response company, my insurance would be even less.  This is of course the next step ....

       Once again there was an accident on the Ben Schoeman today.  A trip that should take me anything from 15 to 20 minutes took me almost 2 hours !! What amazes me is that the government just do not seem to be taking this issue seriously.  Yes they can increase petrol prices at a whim, yes they can introduce a "road accident fund levy", and yes they can put up toll gates.  Improve the infrastructure between Johannesburg and Pretoria ? Now why would that be a priority ? ....

       After watching "Bruce Almighty" for the first time I was reminded again why I seldom buy a lottery ticket.  The chances of actually winning something worthwhile is astronomical / 0.  This after standing in line for 30 minutes or more, since no-one actually buys a ticket the day before. But, say, I win the 1 million or 4 million or for that matter the 15 million.  Strangely enough, there always seems to be 2 - 6 winners, so effectively I'd end up with 500 000.  With that, I can buy a middle class home, which still leaves me with paying the rates & taxes, insurance, armed response security, 2 x guard dogs, gardening services.    Then again, maybe I should just opt for the trip around the world, even if it only means getting as far as London.  Applying the law of averages of course my luggage will end up in Australia and have better in-flight entertainment ....

        The title of my blogspot is based on a tongue in cheek story (author unknown) of the name changes South Africa went through not so long ago.  Tswane is still a point of contention.  Theoretically the municipality is called Tswane, but the city is still called Pretoria.  Imagine how many trees died for the printing of new maps world wide.  It might actually be a good idea to have said map nearby to compare notes with the story below.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I wanted to leave a message for a colleague in Cape Town and this was the result.  "Please ask him to phone me in Polokwane", I said  "Where?" his secretary asked sounding as if she had bitten into a lemon "Polokwane, where's that?"  "Between Mokopane and Makhado in Limpopo"  "Where is this?" she asked patiently. I could hear she thought she had a joker on the line.  "Well", I explained, "you drive from Tswane past Bela-Bela and Modimolle through the tollgate.  Continue past Mokopane but watch your speed as speed traps make lots of money from those traveling too fast. Polokwane is just after Mokopane but if you reach Makhado you have gone too far."  I am not quite sure how we ended on the road route when all I wanted was a telephone call.  "Just hold it right there sir" she interrupts "Where is Makhado?"  "Between Polokwane and Musina" I said, trying to be helpful.  "Excuse me sir but where in hell is Musina?" getting slightly hysterical.  "Musina is between Makhado and Harare" I said gently.  "Do you live in Harare?" She asks as if she had suddenly seen the light.  "No" I said "I am trying to explain where Polokwane is".  "In Zimbabwe?" she asks hopefully.  "No in Limpopo" I corrected her.  She gave a helpless sigh and said "Please can we start again".  I think at this stage she thought she was live on air with Leon Schuster and became a bit wary.  "Where is Tswane?"  "That's easy" I said. "Between Bela-Bela and Egoli".  "No sir I mean the town".  "So do I" said I.  I could hear she was now into soapies while I was still on the road so to speak. "Egoli is on the other side of Twsane when coming from the direction of Bela-Bela" I said.  "Excuse me sir, have you perhaps had too much to drink?"  "No", I said "I am not drunk, they changed the name".  "Do you mean someone has changed your name?"  "No, not my name, the town's name" I corrected her.  "What town's name?"  "Pietersburg".  "You live in Pietersburg!" she cries and I could hear the dawn of understanding.  "No" I said "I live in Polokwane formerly known as Pietersburg"  "No s**t?" she asked.  "No s**t" I confirmed.  "So you are phoning from Polokwane previously know as Pietersburg?"  "Exactly", I confirmed.  "Now...... what were all the other names you mentioned?" she asked.  I realised this lass needed a lesson in the geography of our country pretty damn quick so I explained:  "Egoli was Johannesburg. Tshwane is Pretoria. If you travel north you pass Bela-Bela, formerly Warmbaths, after that Modimolle that was Nylstroom and Potgietersrust that is Mokopane now. After Mokopane you get Polokwane that was Pietersburg then Louis Trichardt that became Makhado. After you have passed Makhado you get Musina that was originally Messina."  "And Musina is by the Limpopo!" she said triumphantly.  "Yes" I said "but the Limpopo I was speaking of is the province".  "What do you call the river then".  "Limpopo" I said.  "Bl**dy hell!"  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       One of my almost daily readings is  urlLink Shark Tank .  Some light comedy relief from dealing with clueless clients, of which our company has a few.  It takes me back to when I gave computer training courses.  This was way back when PC's had monochrome screens, a choice of black/white, black/orange and the ghastly black/green options.  Mice were still grey/brown furry critters chased by cats.  The first day of training consisted of "what is a pc?".  This involved picking up the keyboard and demonstrating the use of the various keys.   "When you look at the keyboard you will see two enter keys.  You may press either of them when you are required to press enter"    "At the top of the keyboard you will notice function keys.  For example, when you have to press F10 you will choose this key.  You will not be pressing f and 1 and 0"  (This is said with a straight face, since this happened!)  I once walked past one of my co-trainers class and saw her stacking phonebooks on the floor.  She was trying to explain how directories work.  For some reason this was the one thing that truly stumped people.  That was until the company started implemented colour screens and mice!  I had a woman in my class holding the mouse in front of her, rolling the little ball with her fingers and lining it up on the screen.  Suffice it to say, "double click" was quite a challenge for her.  The last day of the 5 day course consisted of "how to backup your files".  This was basically copying files to a floppy disk.  This is also when I find out if they really understood directories and the difference between c:/ and a:/.  There would be at least one person that had no clue where to put the floppy disk.  Instruction: Remove the cover of the floppy disk Action taken: Take scissors, cut open floppy disk  Instruction: Place floppy disk in floppy disk drive Action taken: Try to force the floppy disk in the little space between the pc cover and the floppy disk drive.  I had my fair share of strange support calls.  Client:  My pc doesn't switch on when I press the on button  Me:  Did you check if the power on the screen is switched on?  Client:  Yes  Me:  Did you check if the power cable is plugged in at the back?  Client: (slightly irritated)  Yes  Me:  Did you check if the power cable is plugged into the wall socket and switched on?  Client: (very irritated)  Yes!  Me:  awrighty then, I'll go and have a look  At least this guy had the decency to meet me half-way up the stairs, to tell me that the power cable was NOT plugged into the wall socket  Client:  My mouse don't want to go right anymore  Me:  huh? whaddaye mean?  Client:  I want the arrow thingy to go right, but the mouse won't go right anymore  Me:  whokay, maybe the mouse ball is dirty.  I'll be there shortly to clean it.  I get to her office, now picture this.  The pc is on the far left of her desk, she's standing on the right side of her desk, holding the mouse on the right edge of the table. Client:  You see, the thingy don't want to go right anymore.  (since she'd run out of desk space!) I look at her and without saying a word i pick up the mouse and put it back on the mouse pad. Client:  Oh!   And then the client that wanted Lotus 1 and Lotus 2 and Lotus 3.  This is only funny if you know that it should be Lotus 1-2-3.  The company provided us with these little floppy disk holders that could take 50 floppies. I learned never to tell a client to file a floppy disk.  This could result in: a) Stapled onto the inside of a hard cover folder and "filed" in the file cabinet b) Holes punched into the floppy and "filed" in a ring binder  It's fun looking back and having a good chuckle about, and to know for certain that I will have to be paid a LOT more to ever do training again :)

       I read an interesting blog about " urlLink Love American Style ", which led me to " urlLink No no no .. you're doing it all wrong " which then took me to " urlLink How to blog ".   What is the fascination with blogging?  This almost voyeristic interest with the lives and opinions of complete strangers?  Rita hit the nail on the head with her post " urlLink seperation anxiety "  So let me take you on a trip of my little blogging town.  First stop is at  urlLink AJ's  for an update on his tale of growing up and family life.  The next visit is to see if there's something new and interesting from  urlLink CarringtonVanston  today.    For a little detour let's go this way now.  Out of morbid curiosity, a peek at what the  urlLink grave digger  has dug up or buried lately.  I'm still not sure if this guy is for real. Is there some deep joke I'm missing out on here?  Ah yes, and here we have  urlLink Steve .  He is in therapy.    Moving along swiftly let's rest a while at  urlLink Leah's  for her inspiring, interesting and sometimes sad stories of life in Jerusalem.  Now it's on to see if  urlLink Tanya  is back from NYC.  Oh well, still not back it seems.  On to see what we can find at  urlLink TJ's .  Who hasn't read his blog?!    For something a bit more family orientated with  urlLink Jenn  and the funny things her kids get up to. Then we bounce over to see what  urlLink Leese  has been up to.  I'm waiting for the day she cooks stinky food for everyone in her office! Just around the corner we find  urlLink Jay .  He's such a tease (or is that a gentleman?)for not letting on if big jay is getting any.    Then we're off again for a bit of beautifull writing by  urlLink Queenie . Next on the list is the outrageous, original, unsyndicated?, slightly weird  urlLink monkey cage .  Last, but not least is  urlLink JP , that is if he still has access to blogging after his run in with the dictatorship of the IT geek.  This leaves me with a slight predicament.  Which is my favourite blog?  Maybe I should have a "competition" like  urlLink Barrie .   If you had to choose only one blog to read which one would it be?

       As winter slowly sets in I'm reminded of the comfort food my mom used to make for us.    I fondly remember coming home from school on a cold day and find that my mom had made melkkos.  It's home-made noodles cooked in a lot of milk with cinnamon and sugar. No-one can make it like my mother did.  Then there were the koeksisters, which will give any dietician a heart attack.  It's plaited dough, deep fried and then soaked in a sweet, sweet sugar and spice sauce. The secret is that the sauce has to be made the previous day.  I loved it when guests came over because then my mom would make melktert.  The closest I can come to describing it, is that it's a traditional tart with a hard crust and a soft filling of milk/eggs/cinamon/butter/sugar. It sounds a bit bland but it's one of my favourites.  Rainy days were the best.  Then it was time for pannekoek!  Pannekoek is almost like pancakes, but flatter and bigger, about the size of a small plate, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, then rolled up.  Fancy restaurants now serve it with other types of fillings with anything from mince to poached pears.  Just give me the cinnamon and sugar variety please.  As kids, baking day was a highlight.  We would fight about who got to lick out the bowl, lick the spoons and help with the mixing.  As we grew up we'd all pitch in and help for the simple reason that nothing tastes as good as when it's hot off the stove or fresh out of the oven.  Things could get ugly when all of us were home since there's 6 of us, 5 brothers and me, the spoilt brat.  Most of us have a sweet tooth and many a fight was fought over the "last piece".  My one brother tried to steal the last piece and hide it in the fridge.  He seemed to be genuinly surprised that it was found by someone else.  We had perfected the art of finding anything sweet in the house.  My dad would buy these assorted chocolates and then share it out when he got home.  There was a whole ritual involved with this.  Everyone brought a bowl and he would equaly share out the sweets.  Then the negotiations would start because none of us liked the chocolates with the ginger fillings.  "I'll give you my ginger filling for your orange flavour".  Once that was done we would each go to our own corner and eat everything at one go.  Now that I think about it, my dad might have done this to have about 20 minutes of peace and quiet.  My mother seldom ate sweets so she would put hers away for later.  Later being us going on the prowl for more sweeties!

       Once again I couldn't quite make it up on time this morning.  I'm not a morning person and I generally tend to stay up late.  This often results in me having to drag myself out of bed in the mornings.    Then along comes on-line games.  I enjoy strategy/adventure games where everyone has a chance to win or at least get ahead.  For some reason though I'd never played a MUD.  This is an on-line adventure game which is text based.   A few days ago someone gave me the url for  urlLink Legend of the Green Dragon (LoGD)  and I created a character just to see what it's like.  The first few days my poor little druid kept on dying until I got the hang of things.  Last night I entered the "just one more" phase.  This is when I'm playing a game and I just want to do one more level.  I ended up going to bed way past bed time, and it's a week night!  I remember years ago I played an on-line adventure game which had 2D graphics.  This was so much fun since all my friends played it as well.  We would spend weekends sitting in front of our computers gathering and exchanging swords, amulets, necklaces.  It was also possible to change the colour of clothes the character was wearing with dyes and special boots.  The only issue with this game was that it wasn't free.  Eventually everyone just stopped playing it.  Nowadays I actually have shop bought computer games that I have never played!  It interferes when my pc is dial-up on the internet.  I have to exit the game to update my blog, check my email, chat on irc, scan the forums I'm subscribed to and, worst of all, I can't play LoGD!

       Back in the office today and I was wondering what to write about.  Sometimes I have these really great ideas for a blog and then I wake up.  I didn't have much to do in the office today, just some paperwork and emails.  Around me everyone was doing their own thing, which is pretty normal for us.  There's the office organiser.  You can generally find her in the kitchen cleaning up, or else in the shops bying the coffee/sugar/milk/biscuits/etc.  On our weekly meetings she's the one that reprimands the rest of us slobs to pack the dishwasher and switch it on in the afternoons before we leave.  She often threatens us with" "You are a bunch of slobs and I'm going to draw up a schedule so everyone can pull their weight".  You may be asking what is her real job?  She's a project manager.  There's the office scatterbrain.  He has already been told that he will be getting the prize for worst traveller this year.  This is because he traveled to some god-forsaken country in eastern europe with a visa that wasn't valid.  He also managed to miss his connecting flight completely.  This might not seem to be out of ordinary, except that there was a 3-hour stop over for him to get to his next flight.  You can find him sitting behind his computer downloading colouring pictures for his kids because he'd completely forgotten about the meeting he has to go to.  There's the office spin doctor.  This guy can take a simple statement and make it sound like a tv advertisement. "If you buy this at the low-low price of $, you will also get this stunning, exceptional, one of a kind set of dinky-toys."  Of course he never settles for less than the best. Due to his influence, our offices are fitted out with cherry wood furniture, each of us have a real leather chair, and much, much more.  None of us complain about this.  There's the office chatterbox.  You can find him with a phone stuck to his ear making a deal of some kind or another.  He can and will talk about anything and everything. The merits/demerits of overseas investments?  The influence of some or other religious group on the moral standards of the western world?  The advantages of bying a dishwasher for the office kitchen? Oh wait, that last one is him actually bying one.  He is also the office shopaholic.  Never go on a business trip to Dubai with him.  I own pretty and expensive persian carpets because of him.  There's the office geek.  This is trully an achievement in a company where 90% of us have a computer related job.  You can find him stuck behind his pc, re-installing it with new software he dowloaded from somewhere.  His pc is equipment with every type of monitoring software you can imagine. He also whines if you don't want to join in on the network game he's just setup.  Then there's the office worker.  While the rest of us are playing computer games or talking about stuff, he sits behind his desk with at least 6 heaps of documents he is working on.  It is nothing strange to get a phonecall from him at 6 in the evenings to find out how things went with the client.  He does everything from project management, billing our customers, providing us with our payslips, processing our claims and making sure our trips are organised and paid for.  Once in a while he'll jump up and say "how about a beer?".  Then all of us get taken out for lunch at the company's expense.  For the first time in my life I'm working for a company where I like everyone.

       Gardening update: I'm sitting here with the scars from gardening.  I should really wear gloves next time. The lawnmower wasn't touched but the weedeater did a fair amount of work.  The ants have not gone into hybernation but was treated to 15 liters of ant poison.  They just don't seem to get the message!  There also seems to be a large amount of spiders in the Wendy. (A Wendy is like a little house made of wood in the backyard where all the gardening stuff is thrown in).  I'm arachniphobic (sp?) so I did not venture to far into the wendy.   aha, just read  urlLink The Monkey Cage  and decided "shed" is a better word to describe what a Wendy is.   Furniture update: My newly bought antique furniture was supposed to be delivered on thursday, which became friday, which is now scheduled for next week wednesday.  The guy from the shop decided that the table top needs to be sanded and something else also have to be fixed.  I wasn't really listening. The jury is still out on how I feel about this: a) They're providing excellent service in their care and attention to detail OR b) The table fell of the truck and now has to be put back together from scratch  Work update: I'm getting to work (read play) on one of these next week --->>  urlLink Sun Fire E25K Server   Family update: My dad will just have to live with the state of my garden. After all, it's MY garden and if i like it wild, i like it wild.  So there!  As well, he might feel sorry for me and convince my brother to install that sprinkler system.  I am after all my dad's only daughter and years of experience have taught me that my brothers ignore me, but they never ignore my dad. *evil chuckle*.

       so many! There's  urlLink blogrolling ,  urlLink haloscan ,  urlLink technorati ,  urlLink flooble ,  urlLink unkymoods  and  urlLink nerds on site .  These are just a few of what is available to enhance, upgrade, liven up and customize your blog.    Now where did I put that damn html manual again?  What the heck is CSS? I don't do microsoft!! What is OPML & RSS?! I know what php is, but does blogger support PHP? Maybe I should just do the external posting option, but I like the template idea for ease of maintenance.  Now, think about this for a while, "ease of maintenance".  Somehow that sounds like "military intelligence"  After carefull consideration I'll have one haloscan, even if I "lose" all of my 3 previews comments made by kind and considerate fellow beings, with one unkymoods, hold the blogrolling and maybe next time I'll try some of the other options.  Thank gawd it's free!

       Tomorrow is a public holiday, which is a godsend.  This means I can actually mow the lawn before my dad's visit on Sunday.   The saga of my lawn.  I believe that it has been mowed a sum total of 6 times this year.  Of which I was responsible for about 3 times.  For the rest I relied on my brother's sympathy to go and mow the lawn when I'm travelling.  Thank goodness for brothers that sometimes remember they have a sister.   When do I know the lawn is getting too long?  There's 2 signs.  The first sign is when I only see my dogs ears sticking out when they run through the long grass in the backyard.  Both my dogs are cross-chows.  The second sign is when my neighbours starts mowing the grass on the pavement in front of my house.  The issue with getting it done before the weekend is that my dad is a meticulous gardener and he'll have a heartattack when he sees the state of my garden.  Apart from the lawn that REALLY needs a bit of attention, there's the flower beds.  The flower beds are green, which is good, but from a distance it's difficult to differentiate between the weeds and the plants.  Hopefully I've put a stop to the ant colony that has (have?) infested the entire garden.  I stopped using a spray gun for the ant poison, but resorted to using a watering can.  That way I could apply more ant poison a lot quicker than walking around spraying milliliters into each little anthole.  Then again, the ants may just have gone dormant with winter setting in.  Maybe I should consider getting garden services .... Let me think about this ... naw, I can do this :)

       I visited my brother & his family today for my long overdue furniture shopping. As I drove back home this afternoon I thought about the differences in our lifestyle.   I can just pack and go, literally and figuratively.  In contrast, my sis-in-laws day started with taking her mom and aunt to the hairdresser, at 8!  I was still fast asleep as is normal for me on a saturday morning.  I arrived at their house and only their son was there.  After the hairdresser my sis-in-law picked me up from their house, then we went to drop off her mom and aunt.  We were already running late at this point. On the way to the furniture store her daughter phoned to be picked up from the mall.  We first went furniture shopping though.  Then off to the mall on the other side of the suburb to pick up her daughter.    At this point my brother phones to say he's on his way home and what's for lunch.  So off to the shops we go to buy something to eat.  This turned into a mini monthly shopping event with everything from 5 types of breakfast cerial to all the ingredients for soup being bought.  The plan was to just have hot dogs for lunch.  Then I looked at the time and realised I need to get home to let the cleaning lady out.  It was already 2:30!   At no point had my sister-in-law done anything just for herself. I also know that her afternoon was most likely spent preparing food, cleaning the house and doing the laundry.    Being a mom is hard work!  It's not just the 2 teenagers and the housework, but my brother can be a bit helpless at times as well.  He sometimes can't find his pants/car keys/tennis racquet then she has to find it for him.  Oh, I did spend a goodly sum of money at the furniture shop.  The new coffee tables look marvelous in my lounge.  I just need to upgrade the rest of the furniture in the lounge to fit with the coffee tables.  The dining room set and big coffee tables are hopefully being deliver late next week :)

       I recently moved into my house.  Recently being 18 months ago.  There are still rooms that lack furniture, like the dining room, and my study contains mostly opened up and rummaged through boxes that are covered in dust and cat hair.  So this weekend I'm planning to go shop for furniture, with my sister-in-law, because she knows all these interesting and out of the way shops that sell the most stunning furniture.  I've tried this before about 6 months ago, but that was more a non-bying event.  My sister-in-law firmly believes in "looking for the best deal".  This meant that we ended up going to about 10 shops and me not bying a thing.  I wanted to buy, but my sis-in-law was sure the next place would have something cheaper/better/nicer.  Her kids were with us, for some reason.  At about the 3rd shop her son says "when are we going home?" to which I replied that we're not even half way. He opted to just sit in the car and get on his sisters nerves. Teenagers!  My usual shopping sprees involve walking into a shop, seeing something I like, and buying it.  "So, that bed costs R4000? That's ok, here's a cheque and the delivery address". Nevermind that for the rest of the month I live on bread and water and sleep on a really nice bed.  I will rather not mention the results of my desire to have a DVD-player.  My sis-in-law has agreed to take me back to the very first shop we went to the first time around.  Hopefully they still have the same dining room table I wanted originally.

       I confess that I chat, on IRC.  One of the thousands of people that spend easily 4-5 hours every night logged on to a chat site.  I've been part of the scene for years now and there's a few pet peeves done by "newbies" that can be so frustrating.  Frustrating for them and me.  The other night I was logged on, minding my own business, chatting with a few friends when a newbie entered the channel.  He didn't bother to try and talk in open channel but immediately entered a private conversation with me.  His opening line was "can I chat to you in private?".  This sounded pretty polite to me, so I just as politely said no.  My mom always told me never to talk to strangers, especially not in private!  So I thought that would be the end of it.  Right? Wrong!.  The next minute he starts whining, please talk to me, please, please.  Which immediately wiped the image I had of him being a polite person, to be replaced by him being an extremely desperate person.  Desperation is not a pretty thing to witness in a 30-year old.  If of course he is 30.  One thing I have learnt from IRC is that you really do not know who you are talking to.  Unless of course it's someone you know/have met/received a glowing reference for.  What makes a total stranger, that doesn't know me from jack, beg to talk to me?  I bet he does that to all the girls.  Another thing I've learnt from IRC is that when someone says they're ugly/fat they're generally not exagerating.  Trust me on this one.  And then of course, the only way to verify if a guy really is single, is to meet with one of his friends or a family member and ask them.   The best rip-offs on IRC have been to get a guy chatting in private, aluding at sexual things, then turning around and telling him that I'm actually a guy.  It's fun to watch them run away screaming!  IRC can be such fun, talking to different people from all over the world.  Almost like blogging, just in real time.  I've talked to 17-year olds that are so mature you wouldn't have guessed that they're actually 17, and then I've talked to 40-year olds that need a hiding, and not in a good way either.  I've seen people meet on IRC and actually end up getting married, but I've also seen people that tried a long distance relationship that ended in tragedy. There's also been a few that actually flew to another country to meet "the person of their dreams" just to have him not pick them up from the airport.  Now really, that's just the ultimate in bad taste.  At least the guy could have sent an sms or something : "honey, sweetie, sexy, I'm actually 5'2", wide, jobless, still living with my mom, and you'll have to catch a taxi to the following address"  I've met some of my best friends on IRC, so there is hope that newbies will learn that chatting is supposed to be fun and not be taken seriously.

       The article  urlLink "How Not To Get Fired Because of Your Blog"  caught my eye, since I work in an environment where some of the information is "proprietry this" and "confidential that".  With this still fresh in my mind I opened my work mailbox and would you believe it, there's a mail with the heading "Company policy on blogging". I chuckled and thought this is what I get for bloggin from work. Good thing that the company thinks blogging is marvelous and encourages employees to subscribe.  The email even provided some links to other blog sites!!  My work environment is of course perfectly suited to my way of doing things.  It is not strange to walk into the offices and find some of the guys playing Warcraft over the network. The director may even join in, but he prefers first person shoot'em up games. I prefer playing on-line  urlLink puzzles  and I don't mind my co-workers leaning over my shoulder giving advice. As long as the dead lines are met and customers are happy we can do what we like!

       I ran across a website today called  urlLink group hug // Anonymous online Confessions .  (  all rights to finding this site goes to  urlLink the monkey  - I thought he was just joking around with us  )   It made me ponder.&nbsp; What is there in my life that I would want to confess anynomously?&nbsp; What is there in anyones life that they would want to confess, anynomously?&nbsp; After reading a few confessions that made me chuckle I ran into a few that was disconcerting and then I ran into quite a few that was just downright nasty. &nbsp;I'm referring to the term nasty not in the form of being mean, but in the form of being vomit-inducing.   Then this started me thinking on religions that require or suggest confessions of some form or another.&nbsp; It's one thing to anonymously confess on a website and people have the choice to read it or not, it's another to be in a position to have to listen to it.   This then led me to think of how many times we misuse our friendships in the same way.&nbsp; Or is this a sign of a good friend, that they will listen to anything that leaves my mouth?&nbsp; Even when I forget to put my brain in gear before I engage my mouth?   Which brings me back to why would anyone want to confess anything?&nbsp; Is it because we are fearfull that a confession will hurt someone or make them think less of you?&nbsp; Maybe it is just a case of something being socially unacceptable in the culture that we live in.   My verdict is that it is somehow liberating to post a confession anonymously. &nbsp;Now I just hope they weren't lying about the anonymous bit

         as per link followed from    urlLink   Vadergrrrl's      Not sure I agree with "the fool" bit.&nbsp; I'm not stupid, but maybe it refers to me&nbsp;being a&nbsp;sucker for punishment from time to time.&nbsp; Really lovely pictures though.      You are the Fool card. &nbsp;The Fool fearlessly begins the journey into the unknown.&nbsp; To do this, he does not regard the world he knows as firm and fixed.&nbsp; He has a seemingly reckless disregard for obstacles.&nbsp; In the Ryder-Waite deck, he is seen stepping off a cliff with his gaze on the sky, and a rainbow is there to catch him.&nbsp; In order to explore and expand, one must disregard convention and conformity. &nbsp;Those in the throes of convention look at the unconventional, non-conformist personality and think "What a fool".&nbsp; They lack the point of view to understand The Fool's actions. &nbsp;But The Fool has roots in tradition as one who is closest to the spirit world.&nbsp; In many tribal cultures, those born with strange and unusual character traits were held in awe. &nbsp;Shamans were people who could see visions and go on journeys that we now label hallucinations and schizophrenia.&nbsp; Those with physical differences had experience and knowledge that the average person could not understand. &nbsp;The Fool is God.&nbsp; The number of the card is zero, which when drawn is a perfect circle. &nbsp;This circle represents both emptiness and infinity.&nbsp; The Fool is not shackled by mountains and valleys or by his physical body. &nbsp;He does not accept the appearance of cliff and air as being distinct or real.&nbsp; Image from:&nbsp; Mary DeLave http://www.marydelave.com/  urlLink Which Tarot Card Are You?

        I haven't been happy with my blog template layout / colour / design.&nbsp; There's a myriad of options available and doing a search on blogger templates gives me thousands of choices. &nbsp;I just don't have the time to work through all of them.&nbsp; I also reason that downloading the most popular templates defeats the purpose of originality.  I also get used to the way blogs look that I visit. &nbsp;Then there's a template change and I do a double take to make sure I'm visiting the intended blog.&nbsp; I'm just mentioning this because invariably the new template looks incredibly similar to another blog I visit.&nbsp; I also understand the pain of changing a template layout, just to have all the customizations dissappear and things that worked before no longer work.    In the process of writing this log there was a power outage.&nbsp; The New South Africa at it's best. (note the slight sarcastic tone).    Getting back to the originality of my layout. &nbsp;I've been having a look around and seen some pretty neat layouts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The (rethorical?) question now, is&nbsp;do I want to:   go the whole 9-yards?&nbsp; Own&nbsp;hosting?&nbsp; Totally different&nbsp;format of how&nbsp;things work?&nbsp; Like  urlLink dooce  did?   have something relatively straightforward, yet different? &nbsp;As seen at&nbsp; urlLink life cubed ?   opt for&nbsp;custom graphics and funky colour schemes?&nbsp; As stunningly put together by  urlLink kembotxgurl ?  how about&nbsp;something cute?&nbsp; Like what&nbsp; urlLink mimi smartypants &nbsp;did?  or just go completely off the beaten track to something like  urlLink terminal island ? &nbsp;(or is this a monument to what a student can do with to much time on his hands?)   decisions, decisions .....

       One of my favourite stores to go shop in is Makro.&nbsp; Makro is like a huge warehouse full of goods sold in bulk.&nbsp; You can find anything from camping tents to pencils, or rather a box of 20 pencils.&nbsp; So this past Saturday, after an especially cold night I went to Makro to buy an electric blanket.   The thing that's fun about Makro is that I can browse all the aisles, repeatedly.&nbsp; There's always something interesting that I've never seen before and I'm spoilt for choice.   One annoying thing thought, about going shopping there, is the people that have no idea how to drive a trolley.&nbsp; Keeping in mind the warehouse picture, the aisles are quite wide, but there is also a lot of people.&nbsp; So, for example, there's a stack of unpacked goods on the left, and a parked trolley on the right, that leaves just enough space to go through in the middle.&nbsp; Then along comes the incompetent trolley pusher.&nbsp; This person usually lacks the ability to judge short distances, and eye-hand-foot coordination is non-existent.&nbsp; This results in the trolley getting stuck on the stack of unpacked goods.&nbsp; The amazing thing that happens then is that the person will just continue pushing the trolley forward.&nbsp; It was a good thing that the goods was a stack of toilet paper and not flour.&nbsp; It would have been quite spectacular if the trolley had hooked onto a 45kg bag of flour.   I think it might be a good idea to give trolley pushing classes, or stick a big red L on the back of those people that just do not have the knack to negotiate aisles with a trolley.&nbsp; They could even rent out trolley pushers for a small fee.   Another thing I cannot understand is people bringing their teenagers along.&nbsp; Why would you want to submit your teenagers to shopping in a store where there is absolutely nothing entertaining for them?&nbsp; The only thing that happens is that they stand around, watching the one and only TV running infomercials and blocking the aisles.   Thank goodness there's a lot of aisles and I can always take an alternative route to where I'm going.&nbsp; The result of this was that I went home not only with an electric blanket, but also a new toilet seat, a duster, a battery operated scale and a set of 3 wall mountable hook thingies.   The first thing I did when I got home is weight myself.&nbsp; Then I had to call the ambulance because I had a heart attack.&nbsp; I'm now on a diet as of 5 seconds after I got off the scale.

       I ran across some posts today commenting on cats, dogs, squerrils and sloths.  Not necessarily in that order.  I'm a cat person, although I do own real dogs (over 25kg's each).  I accept the fact that most people do not like cats for whatever reason.    One thing that gets to me is when people decide to get a cat and then just dump the cat at some point because they moved or no longer want a cat.  Why not just make use of the services the SPCA offer and have them put up for adoption or put down.  At least they won't suffer.  Contrary to popular belief a cat seldom runs away.  It might go walk-about for a bit, but always comes back to "They Who Feed Us".  In the office park where I work I saw a stray cat with two little ones about a week ago.  The kittens are people shy but the mom cat is quite bold.  Clearly an indication that she came from a home where she was accustomed to be around people.  Maybe her ex-owners dumped her because she was pregnant and they didn't want the responsibility of kittens? I've been feeding them this whole week with the idea to catch them and keep them.    Yesterday I noticed the one kitten is missing.  I hope someone caught the little one to give it a home.  I'm loath to think what else could have happened.  Lunch time I went down to their little corner and while the mom cat was eating I heard another cat miauw.  I walked around trying to locate the cat when I noticed the sound was coming from a drain.  It wasn't the other little one but another adult cat.  He/she didn't want to come out of the drain so I just left it for a bit.  I went down a little while ago to try again and I was able to entice the cat out of the drain.  This cat is in a terrible condition! Incredibly thin with some hair loss on it's back, most probably from being under nourished.  It couldn't eat the food fast enough.  Thin cat is extremely affectionate and just wants to rub up against me.  Now I remember all those things about not touching sick stray animals, but I just cannot leave this poor little thing out there.  It's winter and damn cold.  So now I'm looking for a box to take it to the vet and see if there's any hope for it.  dammit, people should be responsible pet owners.

       I am proudly South African.  Looking at my last two posts it might not seem so.  It's a case of "It's my country and I am allowed to poke fun at certain things".  Just like I'm the only one allowed to criticise my family and friends, but don't you try it.  This post is dedicated to all those born and bred South Africans that have made a positive change to the world around us.     CAT scan  The computed axial tomography scan, or CAT scan, was developed at Tufts University in the UK by South African physicist Allan Cormack and Godfrey Hounsfield of EMI Laboratories. Their achievement secured them the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine   Oil from coal  Sasol is the world's first - and largest - oil-from-coal refinery. It is situated in Sasolburg in South Africa and provides 40% of the country's fuel.   Heart transplant  The world's first heart transplant was performed by Dr Chris Barnard in Cape Town on 3 December 1967   Speed gun  In 1992 Johnson invented the Speedball which was manufactured by South African firm Electronic Development House. The device accurately measures the speed and angles of speeding objects such as cricket and tennis balls.  The South African-made speed gun, developed by Somerset West inventor Henri Johnson, was formally launched at The Oval in England during the 1999 Cricket World Cup.     Kreepy Krauly  The swimming pool vacuum cleaner was invented by Ferdinand Chauvier, a hydraulics engineer who came to South Africa from the Belgian Congo in 1951.    urlLink APS therapy   Gervan Lubbe wondered whether it would be possible to electronically stimulate the body's natural nerve impulses to relieve pain.  After building the first prototypes and obtaining approval from the health department and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, Lubbe formed the company Tech Pulse in 1993 to produce, market and distribute the Action Potential Stimulation device.    Pratley Putty  Pratley's famous glue is the only South African invention that has been to the moon. In 1969 the putty was used to hold bits of the Apollo XI mission's Eagle landing craft together.  Krugersdorp engineer George Pratley invented his famous sticky stuff in the 1960s while looking for a glue that would hold components in an electrical box.    Dolosse  Dolosse are large, unusually shaped concrete blocks weighing up to 20 tons. The structures are designed to break up wave action and protect harbour walls and coastal installations.  Designed by Eric Merrifield and first installed in East London harbour, they are now used all over the world.      urlLink Nobel Prizes      Physiology or Medicine 1951         urlLink MAX THEILER  - "for his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it"     Physiology or Medicine 1979      urlLink ALLAN M.

          Police stations now hire private security firms to protect them (The police stations have panic buttons to call armed response when they are burgled).   Police cars are fitted with immobilisers and gearlocks!   Landlords may not evict illegal squatters unless they offer them alternative accommodation.   Post Office workers are videotaped opening the mail and stealing the contents, but the film may not be used as evidence, because the workers were not informed that they were being filmed and the filming is an intrusion of their privacy.   A minister of religion who stole millions from overseas donated funds for the oppressed, returns to the country to a hero's welcome and is officially welcomed by the government, represented by the Minister of Justice.   20% of the city's population pays for everyone else's electricity and water supply, and get prosecuted if they refuse to pay.   A murderer gets a 2-year sentence and a pirate TV viewer a 6 month sentence.   The Constitutional Court declares the death sentence unconstitutional, but rules that abortion is okay.   The prisoner wardens strike   The prisoners strike and get to vote in elections!    The Student Union demands that academic achievement shouldn't be a criterion for university acceptance, as it is discriminatory.   A government Minister is caught driving her car with a forged license, but the case is dropped for "lack of evidence".   The previous health MEC and the President question the link between Aids & HIV   Government ministers meet with masked gang leaders to ask their advice on how to reduce crime and violence.   Scholars protest at the lack of schooling facilities by destroying school buildings.   The entire country sees a thug admit on TV news to murdering several people, but the police say they have no case.   You consider it a good month if you, or someone close to you, get mugged only once.   The police ask you if they must follow up the crime you've just reported.   A minister is fired and returns the government cellphone but keeps the govt BMW.   A 45-year-old engineer gets replaced by a 25-year-old, who cannot even write his name.   The employees dance (toi-toi) in front of the building to show how unhappy they are. (It's the only country in the world where striking workers show how angry they are by dancing)   Illigal immigrants leave the country because the crime rate is too high.   The police are the first on the scene for most major crimes, without being called.   Votes have to be recounted until the right party wins.   Burglar bars become a feature, and a great selling point for your house.    You can decorate your garden walls with barbed wire.    If you live in Johannesburg, you get to brag about living in the most dangerous city in the world   You're considered clumsy if you cannot: use a cellphone (without car kit), change CDs, drink a beer, put on make-up, read the newspaper and smoke, all at the same time while driving a car at 160 kph on the highway.    Where else can you get oranges with 45% alcohol content at rugby matches?    You can experience bad service in eleven official languages.   You can eat half dried meat (biltong) and dried worms (mopani worms) and not be considered disgusting.   You don't have to keep up with the neighbours any longer, since they've emigrated.   You get ATM's with braille   People start joking about the crime rate!

       Here's some things to look out for if you ever visit South Africa.  If you're South African, you know this is true ;)     You produce a R100 note instead of your drivers license when stopped by a traffic officer   You can do your monthly shopping on the pavement   You have to hire a security guard whenever you park your car   You can count the national soccer team's scores with no fingers   To get free electricity you have to pay a connection fee of R750   Hijacking cars is a profession   Defecating in a garden can win you R1-million   You can pay your tuition fees by holding up a sign at a traffic light   The petrol in your tank may be worth more than your car   More people vote in a local reality TV show than in a local election   People have the most wonderful names: Christmas, Goodwill, Pretty, Wednesday, Blessing, Brilliant, Gift and Given   "Now - Now" can mean anything from a minute to a month   You continue to wait after a traffic light has turned to green to make way for taxis traveling in the opposite direction   Traveling at 120 km/h you're the slowest car on the highway   You're genuinely and pleasantly surprised whenever you find your car parked where you left it   A bullet train is being introduced but we can't fix potholes   The last time you visited the coast you paid more in speeding fines and toll fees than you did for the entire holiday   You paint your car's registration number on the roof   Half of your mail is guaranteed to reach its destination   You have to take your own linen with you if you are admitted to a government hospital   You dial a toll - free number and nobody answers   You have to prove that you don't need a loan to get one   Prisoners go on strike

       whoops, tomorrow is the last day of handing in my tax paper thingies.  I've been procrastinating.  This is not a new phenomenon.  Just call me the queen of procrastinators.  It's a family trait although neither of my parents were procrastinators, or any of our grandparents.  A recessive gene, or something.  Anyway. A good friend helped me to complete the tax forms about 4 weeks ago.  All that I still have to do is sign the form and attach a detailed travel log thingy, and make photocopies of everything.  This is the bit that I haven't done yet.  At least, I've done it, but I haven't printed it out yet.  "Done" is such a relative thing.    So, seeing that it is after 16:00 already, it's not a good idea to drive into town to hand in my tax returns.  The reasons being that it's peak traffic, it's not safe to be in town after dark and what would I be if I didn't procrastinate until the last minute.  The cut off time is tomorrow evening 18:00.  I'm sure I'll make it by then.  I'm still beating my all time record of being 3 years late on tax returns.  A man came knocking on my door and I was actually fined!  I'll never be doing that again.

        I started a blog, then deleted it, then went through this iteration a few times.  Then I browsed my growing list of daily blogs to read.  Some days there seems to be a "theme of the day".  It's fun to try and follow the path of where it started.  A while back there was quite a few men / women / relationship stories doing the rounds.  Then of course the recent personality test thing.  Special mention today goes to the post about  urlLink blog lingo  on " urlLink Unbeareable likeness of Bean ".  Today I also found quite a few dog stories, which immediately made me think of writing a story of my dogs.  I decided against a certain doggy incident, since it didn't have a humorous / happy twist at the end.  I had three dogs, now I only have 2.  However, I am going to write about my dogs.  Bonnie and Clyde, secretly known as the "killer dogs".  They are so adorable and love me, because if they don't I'll put them on a diet of dry pellets.  Wait, they are on that already.  This probably explains why Bonnie keeps on trying to eat the fish food, while it's floating on the pond.  Within the first couple of months of getting them, they almost destroyed my garden.  They did destroy the garden hose, with an uncanny ability to chew it into evenly sized lengths about 30 cm's long.  I put electric fencing around the garden beds.  My dogs are not stupid, they were only shocked once.  They are still bold enough to stand a hairs breadth away from the little wire.  The advantage of this is that whenever I don't want them to chew something into oblivion, I just hammer a few metal rods into the ground around said item, and put a single wire around it.  Electrified or not, they are not going to try their luck.  My dogs are smart.  My dogs have never been washed.  This is not for lack of trying on my part.  I've found that I'll need at least 2 pairs of extra hands to get the job done.  By the time I've pinned a dog between my knees, holding on to his/her scruff and opened the tap the "slippery soap" move is made.  I'm just not strong enough to hold on, and sitting on them defeats the purpose of washing them, and not me.  I've never progressed past opening the tap, never mind actually putting soap on them.  Doggie parlour here we come! or not?  I can push my fingers in their mouths, sit on them and pull their tails, but let someone else try that and the "killer dogs" emerge.  I first saw this when I took Bonnie to the vet to have her fixed.  The vet almost couldn't do the job, because she was so aggressive.  She was still goofy from the sedation, couldn't walk yet, but still went after the vet with jaws clapping together.  They just don't seem to like being touched by strangers.  Most of the time they do listen to me ("she-who-feeds-us").  Apart from the one time Clyde decided the world outside the gate has to be investigated.  This was early in the morning and I was still in my pajamas.  Screaming at, and chasing a dog down the street in your pajamas is not one of the most elegant situations to be in.  I was getting angry with him for ignoring me until I saw the complete desperation in his eyes.  He was just a poor little confused puppy.  Now I just have to give him a dirty look and he backs away from the open gate.  Living arrangements at my abode are perfectly orchestrated.  Dogs outside, cats inside and fish in the pond.  The wild birds are toys as far as the dogs are concerned.  They actually succeed in catching one from time to time.  Bird catching dogs.  They might not understand "roll-over" but I think they're pretty talented.

       Popped over to  urlLink AJ's  this morning and saw that he'd also joined the masses in taking an on-line test.  I'm addicted to on-line tests, it's so much fun and seldom accurate!  The results of my " urlLink better personality "    Wackiness: 44/100  Rationality: 50/100  Constructiveness: 56/100  Leadership: 32/100   You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.   You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.   Please don't get even with this web site   There's also  urlLink better job, better boyfriend/girlfriend, better person and better apartment tests  you can take if you in the mood for a good chuckle. For tests where your result is displayed as part of a pretty picture go have a look at  urlLink quizilla . Some more personality tests with a bit of a bite from  urlLink fuali.com   And that's it for today.

       The pub lunch went well today.  Today being Friday afternoon.  Most of us could make it apart from a couple that had work stuff to do and L that was without a driver.  He has a broken hand and for some reason find it difficult to drive. I made a slight error in my previous post.  In our little group there's three single people.  F & his girlfriend have been dating for years and they finally got engaged!  When the bill arrived I was once again reminded about the difference between men, women and how they generally deal with the bill.  All the guys pulled out R100, irrespective of what they had eaten or drunk, and just tossed it on the pile.  Without even looking at the bill.  Then a quick glance at the bill to notice that the waiter would have gotten almost a 50% tip!.  The next 10 minutes were spent bickering about who gets change.  This because no one wanted change!  When I go out with my girlfriends the fun starts when the bill arrives.  Someone will pull out a pen and use the napkin to work out, to the last cent, how much each have to pay.  This is combined with checking if the bill is correct. "How many G&T's did you have?" "They billed us for two calamari starters, who had the other starter?".  This can take a while.  Then there's the chaos that erupts when a mixed bunch goes out.  The woman want to calculate every last cent, and the men end up paying for everything. Depending on if they're married or not of course ;)

       About once a month a bunch of us go for a pub lunch on a Friday afternoon, from 15:00 onwards.  I suppose it's really just taking the afternoon off, but hey, not much gets done on a Friday afternoon anyway.  We've been doing this now for a good 5 years or so.  Time sure flies when you don't pay attention.  The guys have been doing this for much longer than me, but they were smart enough to realize having only men together drinking is slightly boring.  This is where I was invited along. For the last 2 months no pub lunch was organized for some reason or another.  Most likely because the guys couldn't sort out their schedules.  The theory about women being bad at time management is a lie!  Trying to organize a publunch usually starts with N sending out an email asking when and where.  This is followed by a barrage of emails from all involved.  The emails consist mainly of "I'm on holiday for the next 3 weeks" and a few "I'm working then".  If you really want to sow confusion, just mention that the chosen pub is not to your liking.  Add to that the fact that some email servers are slow and the emails only get delivered the next day.  It sure brightens up a dreary day.    Invariably one of the guys will mention sex.  I'm never quite sure how the connection is made, but I accept the fact they are the male of the species.  T & L are the big culprits in this.  Both of them are married, not to each other of course, but they definately have a fixation on shagging in public places.  Of our little group only two of us are single and strangely enough we get ripped of about being sexually frustrated.  I don't quite understand that.  All of us met years ago while working for the same employer in some form or another.  Playing computer network games the whole day doesn't necessarily constitute working but with budget cuts and projects being cancelled there wasn't much else to do.  I'm not being defensive!    It's nice having a bunch of people to reminisce with and about.  It's cute when the guys try to clean up their language around me.  Hopefully we're all set for this Friday, as long as nothing breaks, crashes or panics.

       My brother was kind enough to come over for a visit to take away a bit of rubble.  This rubble has been laying around since I moved into my new house about a year ago.  Long overdue.  I didn't know where the dumping ground is so I asked one of the guys from work for directions.  Yesterday I went looking for the dumping ground, drove past it at least 3 times but eventually found it.  As I drove back home this nagging little voice asked "double check the times they are open".   I ignored it since dumping grounds are usually open on sundays, right?  Today we drove to the dumping ground with a full load just to find it closed.  Big sign on the gate saying "closed on sundays and public holidays".  When do most people do gardening?  That's right, on sundays and public holidays.  So we're sitting there, fresh out of ideas when we noticed there was a garbage truck inside loading up.  We approached the driver and asked if there's any other dumping grounds we can go to.  This man was kind enough to say we could follow him.  He then proceeds to drive at top speed.  We thought we had lost him, but once again he was kind enough to wait for his.  I was suitably impressed.  As we are following the garbage truck we're pondering where this dumping ground can be since we kept on driving and driving and driving.  I saw a side of the suburbs I've never been to.  We ended up at a huge dumping ground.  A real one, not just the relatively nice ones with garbage containers to put your stuff in.  This was a big heap in the middle of nowhere.  Did I mention the smell?  We made 3 trips there today and there's still at least another 2 loads left to be taken.  There's actually people that go to the dumping grounds to pick up stuff! I was amased.  We saw at least one such person on each trip loading stuff up.  One man's garbage is another man's treasure?  My brother's son found a little solar charger for batteries that absolutely fascinated him.  I told him to throw it away, dammit, it's garbage!  He just ignored me and came up with some lame story that he wanted the magnets on the inside.  I took a well-deserved and prolonged shower this afternoon.

       Finally getting back to the next installment. (A bit of leave and some much needed gardening got in the way)  I did have my own room in the house, that I shared with my two cats. The same ones I have now. When Patricia moved in she brought her dog with. Some type of staffordshire terrier. The new doggy loved to come into the house.  One evening I was walking through the house with the grumpy cat when the dog decided to come into the house. I was holding Grumpy in my arms when the dog thought my cat looked very interesting, and edible. Total chaos ensued. I didn't want to let go of Grumpy since I imagined blood spattered walls and one dead Grumpy, so I held on. Grumpy did not like this situation at all.  Val, a visiting friend, was trying to get the dog out of the house while I ran down the corridor to the bathroom so I could close the door and let Grumpy go. The dog kept following me, jumping up and down like a ping-pong ball. Grumpy was chewing at my hand, no claws though since I was holding on to tightly. At one point Val screamed that Grumpy had bitten her! Eventually the disaster was averted with the dog outside and Grumpy in the bathroom.  Time to asses the damage. My hand was covered in blood. I counted about 16 holes and remembered at some point that Grumpy was gnawing at my finger, teeth scraping against bone. There was way to much adrenalin in my system to feel any pain though. This definitely constituted an after hours visit to the Dr.  Suddenly Val burst out crying since she didn't have money for the Dr and she was only a student. Well, it was either that or get some dreaded lurgy from the cat bite, or try our luck at the pharmacy for a tetanus shot. So off to the pharmacy we went. I'm driving with my bloody hand and still not feeling any pain. The pharmacist was fresh out of tetanus shots but gave one look at my hand and said, "I best think u visit the Dr". So we drove over to the after after hours clinic that had to call the Dr that was on standby. I could hear the money meter running.  Val started crying again because she was scared of needles. I wonder who she thought would have done the injection if the pharmacist had any tetanus shots. She went first at the Dr's office and it was quite anti-climatic "oh, this little bite?". When it was my turn the Dr took my hand and scrubbed it with brush! That's when the pain set in! He also gave me antibiotics and told me that he couldn't give me stitches since it was puncture wounds and it would get nasty.  My hand puffed up nicely in the next 3 days, up to the point where I couldn't close my hand since it did a fair impression of a balloon. I was still the designated driver through all of this.  For the rest of the year my cats stayed in my room, oh what joy. They would have their private little cat fights throught the half open windows with the dogs outside. That's where Stupid got his name. "stupid cat, you really think you're going to take on a dog twice your size?"  The next installment of the story might be the last. I never know.

       Everyone would have friends &amp; family visit, this was usually why the food went missing and the dirty dishes piled up.  There always seemed to be a food issue in the house. The issue being that the cupboards were bare most of the time. Those of us that bought food soon realized that those with money problems would snack on whatever was in the cupboards and share it with their visitors. Coming home in the afternoons looking forward to having a bite to eat, just to find the bite to eat missing in action.  Then there was the time that someone came up with the idea that everyone should get a turn to cook in the evenings, for everyone else. After all, everyone eats dinner. Seven evenings, seven women. Makes sense right? The deal was that everyone would be responsible to buy food for one meal and cook it. As time went by the term meal were defined as consisting of meat, vegetables and starch. A meal is not a meal when there's only vegetables to eat. "I don't care if you think you want to be become a vegetarian, the rest of us are not".  If someone wouldn't be home in time for dinner a plate of food would be put aside for them. The only problem was the dedicated snackers in the house. Two hours after dinner and the plate of food was reduced to just the vegetables. This whole exercise in cooking lasted about a month. Being a woman does not automatically enable you to cook. I've seen grey pasta and I still don't know how that was done.  Parties were the best, and the worst. We had some kick-ass parties and our fair share of the police showing up and telling us to quiet it down a bit. Our one neighbor always complained, the old fart. The parties were generally along the lines of a "bring and barbecue". Everyone was supposed to bring their own food and drinks. Some friends conveniently forgot to bring anything and would just eat and drink whatever was there. This is where I learnt that true friends are the ones that stay behind and help to clean up.  Some visitors would also just use the phone. We had detailed billing on our phone bill so that at the end of the month Petra would work out to the last cent who owed what. Time and time again there would be these long distance phone calls that no-one claimed. I started to think that our house was the place to make free phonecalls and provide free food.  At one point each of us had responsibilities around the house. Abby and Mandy were responsible for cleaning the kitchen. After a while they started refusing since they would leave the house with a clean kitchen in the morning, just to get back to a mess in the afternoons due to the amount of people that had been traipsing through the house. I always wondered if the concept of cleaning up after yourself had gone out of fashion.  Family visits were something else though. All of us would get fair warning when a parent was sighted on the horizon. Everyone cleaned up without complaining. This worked, most of the time. I remember getting home one afternoon to find Mandy's dad walking in the garden and I couldn't understand why. Turns out Cathy had done her laundry that day, and since it was raining outside she thought it would be perfectly ok to just drape her intimate apparel all over the place to dry.  Cathy was also the one that would not pick up her dirty undies in the bathroom. I have a perfectly good gag reflex and there is nothing as gross as finding a piece of dirty underwear with period stains still fresh on it.  One afternoon I got home and my TV was gone. No-one knew where it was. Turns out one of the guys we knew had organized an afternoon of watching soccer with the boys. They just had one problem, they had no TV. So they came over and "borrowed" my TV. I did the wicked witch of the west impersonation when he brought my TV back. "You could have left me a note?" "You have my phone number?" "There was a phone where you watched the soccer?" "Where did you learn that you can just take stuff without asking?" "Will you ever do this again?" At this point his answers were limited to "yes, ma'am, no ma'am"  Never a boring moment! Especially when you mix cats and dogs .... more on that later

       Growing up there were a few things that seemed quite obvious, regarding personal hygiene.  Little things like first washing your hair, then yourself in the shower.  Everyone has their own towel, washcloth and toothbrush.  Then along comes sharing a house with 6 other people with different ideas on hygiene.  In the mornings there was a certain routine to things.  Remember, 7 women, 2 bathrooms and none of us were into using the bathroom at the same time.  The first ones up in the mornings would be Sally and Petra since they had to catch the bus quite early.  Then Cathy would start to get ready to go to her real job, although running late was also part of her routine.  Then it was Abby and Mandy's turn. Both were students and either rode their bicyles or walked to class.  This generally meant that I was the last one to get up ( which seemed to have become a pattern in my later life as well).   By the time I get to the bathroom most everyone had already left the house.  Ah, peace and quiet and wet towels, dirty bathtubs and dirty clothes.  I'm quite possessive about my towel and finding my towel, wet, truly freaked me out.  After closing my eyes and taking deep calming breaths I'd go and get a fresh towel.  There always seemed to be a shortage of clean towels so I resorted to keeping my towel in my room, as well as my toothpaste, toothbrush and well, frankly everything that would usually reside in the bathroom.  If someone didn't have a problem using my towel, there's a distinct possibility that they would use my toothbrush too.  Then I'd walk into the kitchen and have my second deep breathing exercise of the morning.  A pig sty would have been cleaner.  I am not exaggerating.  Well, maybe I am exaggerating a little, pigs are after all uglier.  Everyone had their own set of cupboards.  Petra found the only cupboards that had keys and would lock her stuff away.  She had really nice plates and glasses which the other would just use, since once again, they'd run out of clean kitchen stuff and hey, here's some clean stuff, let's use this, without asking!  Now I am not one the neatest people myself, but it took me about 2 weeks to throw a hissy fit about the state of the kitchen.  Especially after walking into the kitchen one evening to find a big rat sitting in the middle of the floor.  Then there was the incident when someone was actually doing the dishes.  Nothing wrong with that, until she used the drying cloth to wipe something off the floor!  The difference between dish cloth and floor cloth was explained.  We had a talk about the state of the kitchen and I volunteered to give the kitchen a spring clean.  That's when I found the cockroaches.  We are not talking one or two, we are talking hordes!  I was busy unpacking all the cupboards when I noticed a few cockroaches running from under the one bowl, so I peered closer and almost did the "cockroach dance".  The back of the cupboard was covered in cockroaches, you could barely see the white of the wall.  These ones didn't even run away!  Promptly everything was moved out of the kitchen and I went to buy fumigate stuff.  My skin still crawls when I remember the number of dead cockroaches that we found every morning for the next week.  We were never able to get rid of the rats though.  Having 7 people in the same space is challenging enough, but then there was the family and friends to deal with ... more to come on that ...

       A few years ago I shared a 4 bedroomed house with 6 other women.  In case you were wondering, this was all above board.  Fitting 7 young women into a 4 bedroomed house with only 2 bathrooms was quite interesting.  I was the only one with my own room, that I shared with my 2 cats.  Previously I had lived in my own apartment, which I'd put up for sale and it was sold within the first week.  I was left without anywhere to go and moved into the commune until I could find a place of my own again.  This was supposed to be for a couple of months, but I ended up staying there for a year.  This was the first time I came face to face with the peculiarities of other people, up close and personal.  Keeping in mind I don't have any sisters.  All my stuff were stored in the one and only garage apart from my bed, tv, hi-fi and fridge.  I was the only one that owned a tv and a hi-fi.  The tv became common property in the lounge and for some reason only I used my fridge.  Most likely because no one ever had enough money to buy proper food.  Everyone else made use of an antique fridge in the kitchen.  This thing would have to be defrosted on a weekly basis otherwise the door couldn't close anymore.  The house was rented in the name of one of the women who happened to be a hairdresser.  Let's call her Cathy.  She had the outside room converted into a hair salon and was trying to run her own business from there.  There were a few problems though.  With only one telephone line and two students spending lots of time at the house, the phone was used a lot during the day.   Enough so that clients were not able to get through to make appointments.  Cathy also liked to spend a large chunk of her time either at the gym, shopping or hanging out in coffee shops.  There came a time when the bank repossed Cathy's car and she had to go out and find a real job, that paid.  This left me as the only other person with a car.  As the good housemate I ended up being the taxi quite a number of times, especially when someone was running late.  This is where I found out that the majority of women are not good at being on-time, ever.  One morning I was looking through my cupboard for a specific blouse to wear and I noticed it wasn't there.  Then I noticed there were other pieces of clothing missing as well.  I went on a witch hunt, because I was horrified that someone would actually steal clothes from me.  I wasn't the only one missing clothes.  Cathy had already left for work.   That afternoon I confronted her and, quite blase about the fact she said yes, she'd borrowed some of my clothes because she couldn't decide what to wear.  She then started pulling clothes out of her bag.  It turns out that she would regularly take a number of outfits with her to work in case she felt like wearing something else.  I carefully explained to her that you generally ask before you "borrow".  She seemed quite taken aback.  Then there was the personal hygiene issue. That's another story all on it's own!
