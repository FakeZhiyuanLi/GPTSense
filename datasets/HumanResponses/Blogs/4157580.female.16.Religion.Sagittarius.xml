         the reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. maybe they always have been and will be. maybe we've lived a thousand years before this one and in each of them we've found each other. and maybe each time we've been forced apart for the same reasons. that means that this goodbye is a goodbye for the past ten thousand years and a prelude of what will come. when i look at you, i see your beauty and grace and know they have grown stronger with every life you have lived. and i know i have spent every life before this one searching for you. not someone like you, but you, for your soul and mine must always come together. and then, for a reason neither of us understands, we've been forced to say good-bye. i would love to tell you that everything will work out for us, and i promise to do all i can to make sure it does. but if we never meet again annd this is truly goodbye, i know we will see each other in another life. we will find each other again, and maybe the stars will have changed, and we will not only love each other in that time, but for all the times we've had before.in times of grief and sorrow i will hold you and rock you, and take your grief and make it my own. when you cry, i cry and when you hurt, i hurt. and together we will try to hold back the flood of tears and despair and make it through the potholed streets of life.

        when i ask you to  listen to me  an you start givin me advice , you hav not done what i asked .   when i ask you to  listen to me  an you begin to tel me why i shldn feel that way , you are tramplin on my feelins .   when i ask you to  listen to me  an you feel you hav sth to solve my problem , you hav failed me, strange as that may seem .   listen ! all i asked was that you listen, not talk to or do -  jes hear me  .   advice is cheap ; 20 cents will get you both dear abby an billy graham in the same paper .   i can do for myself ; im not helpless - maybe discouraged an falterin , but not helpless .   when you do sth for me that i can an need to do for myself , you contribute to my fear an inadequacy .   but when you accept as a simple fact that i do feel what i feel , no matter how irrational , then i can quit tryin to convince you an can get abt this business of understandin whats behind this irrational feelin . when thats clear , the answers are obvious an i don need advice .   irrational feelins make more sense when we understand whats behind them .   perhaps thats why prayer works , sometimes , for some people - because God doesn give advice or try to fix things . He jes listen an let you work it out for yourself .   so pls listen an  jes hear me  .   an if you want to talk , wait a minute for your turn an il  listen to you  .
