       I have become hooked on to the O'Reilly Factor on Fox news channel for some time now.. The man is incredibly charismatic, despite being hopelessly republican and sometimes showing shades of exteme right-wing bias. Almost 99% of his past shows have him out-smart his guests and speakers with witty and sensational dialog, and I am yet to see one of his guests verbally bludgeon him into submission. I do not agree with many of his views though, but watch the show for the sheer entertainment aspect of it. The show airs on FNC weekdays @ 8 PM and 11 PM EST.

       watched Fahrenheit 9/11 today and was really surprised to see the huge turn out. Most interesting was the large percentage of young people turning up. I would have imagined with the movie being mostly political and opinionated, it would be something the senior folks would be more interested in. The movie has been very controversial, and no doubt this has attracted a lot of interest by all sections of the american movie-going population. The movie turned out to be very well made with an excellent flow of events and statement of facts, but it does show too much sentiment against the incumbent president. All in all a good entertainer for two whole hours.

       on another of my random journeys on the net, I found this rather quirky story...may not be authentic, but it definitely was amusing.  urlLink Patenting SKIN  ? oh well. Well with Microsoft, it isn't that much of a surprise.

       I am really impressed with the speed of my current cable internet connection. It definitely scores over alternatives such as DSL in many aspects, though it can be argued that the difference wouldn't really matter for regular browsing (depends on what the definition of "regular" is, of course). I was a DSL user a few months back and had a difficult time watching streaming movies over the net. I see the DSL companies coming up with innovative ads to regain their market share from the cable internet companies.  Speaking of internet connection speeds, it seems a new record for the fastest internet connection was set recently, a whopping 4.23 Gbps !!, as  urlLink vnunet.com  reports. That kind of speed is insane, I should say..

       ..to become a member of the blogging online community. I am naturally very curious about a lot of things in life (just inquisitive, not a jack-of-all-trades), so hopefully I will be able to blog away and have fun doing it. Some of the topics that I plan to regularly blog on (not necessarily in that order of preference) are the internet and online community, computers and tech stuff, philosophy, current events, movies, and psychology.
