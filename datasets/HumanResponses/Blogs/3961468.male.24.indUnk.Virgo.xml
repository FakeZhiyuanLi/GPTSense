      While in Texas, I ate more food than I should have, and put a few pounds back on.  206-207 as of this morning.  So, I went to the gym.  I've softened up all over the place...arms, chest, belly, thighs, etc, so I wanted to lift a little weights first.  After 6 sets of shoulder presses and 5 chest presses, I got on the elliptical machine.  No sense in blowing myself out the first day.  So, I'm ellipticalling along, getting bored as usual, when they change the channel on one of the TVs to Rocky II.  It was the start of the fight at the end.  You've never seen so many guys at the gym just stop what they were doing at once.  You get some hotties roll in there, and most of them will sneak a glance, put another 50 lbs on their set, or just stare while continuing on.  Not this time.  Everyone lifting weights just stopped for ten minutes.  I was at 20 minutes and normally only go to 25...by the time the fight was over, I was at 32 minutes and my RPMs were like 10 higher than I normally do them at.  As most of you know, Rocky beats Chubbs (Happy Gilmore) the second time, but it's still a great fight.    Apparently, Mike Tyson lost again last night.  I'm sure it doesn't mean a whole lot to him, he just needed that check.  Of course, he could sell one of his TWO Rolls Royces and pay off some credit cards, but that's for the creditors to handle.  Might see if Rob wants to see The Manchurian Candidate today.

      Ok, this is fucking hard as hell.  I'm sitting in seat 28D at 35,000 feet halfway between Houston and Baltimore.  I am having a really hard time typing this is such a cramped proximity.  Being 6'2", I need a little bit of room to stretch my shit out, but this is not a luxury I am provided.  Now is the time for me to document the events of my vacation over the last 5 days.  I took notes, so hopefully you've got time to read.  Saturday July 24th   Didn't get much sleep the night before as I was really anxious about the trip.  Got to sleep a bit after midnight and had to be up at 4:30am.  My parents drove me to BWI, which is roughly a 90 minute trip.  Checking in was relatively uneventful, although I wished I had first class tickets.  The first segment, BWI to Houston, I sat next to a really fat guy who would not share the armrest in any capacity.  I then connected for a 30 minute flight to Austin, and that was it for my flying.  While waiting in Houston, I got a sandwich from Wendy's that was not what I ordered, but didn't feel like going back up there, as they'd messed my sandwich up one time already, so I didn't have the energy. While removing the tomato from the sammich, the bun fell in my lap and got ketchup all over me.  Whatever.  Looked like a small dog crapped in my crotch.  Once I landed in Austin, I was walking behind a girl that was otherwordly hot.  She looked like a dancer in a Ricky Martin video...even had one of those little outfits on.  I tried to get a picture of her while walking behind her, but couldn't get the camera steady in my "stealth mode".  I did fire off one shot, but being the dicknose I am, I left the flash on.  Fortunately, she didn't seem to notice.  Every single person who walked past her stared...even chicks.  Aaron got to the airport just as I picked up my luggage from the baggage claim, so that was good.  We went back to the house and I dropped off my shit, then we went shopping.  I was gonna buy some new shoes, because the shoes I brought with me were my grass cutting shoes.  But everything was overpriced.  $70 for a pair of Pumas.  $85 for a pair of WRANGLERS.  $90 for a pair of Levi's.  Did you know Wal-Mart sells Levi's now?  for like 1/3 the price.  Oh, to be cool in a city where there are no Wal-Marts.  I noticed the recurring theme in Austin is to be "original"  Everyone's t-shirt had something witty written on it.  Either a Ramones,Led Zep logo, Gary Coleman or "Party Trained" printed on the front.  Everything had to be interesting.  A lot of people are Emo there.  Skinny kids wearing a lot of black.  Everyone also wears shirts too small for them.  Even dudes.  It'd be like my brother (280lbs) wearing a L t-shirt.  Seriously.  There weren't many FAT people, but bellys were prevalent.  I actually felt thin compared to a lot of these guys.  From there, we got cleaned up and went out to dinner at Trudy's restaurant on the other side of town.  We met up with one of Aaron's friends and some people she knew.  We waited for 2+ hours for a table.  Well, we waited at the bar, so it was ok.  After that, we took off for 6th street at around 11:15pm.  I was starting to struggle from lack of sleep at this point.  We got to the bar that Shane's band was playing at, and watched some loser band, then a loser comedian.  After that, I tried Shiner Bock (beer), which sucked.  Then I sat down and had to fight off sleep while The Cutaway (Shane's band) played.  They were pretty good, but I couldn't make out the lyrics.  That was pretty much it for day one, but it ended up being my most busy day.  ***End of typing on the plane - it's too damned cramped and the kid next to me keeps getting up***  Sunday July 25th Caught up on my missed sleep for most of the morning.  Went to see Napoleon Dynamite that afternoon.  Funniest movie I've seen in a looooong time.  Most people won't get it, but most people are stupid, so it matters not.  That was the only thing I did all day, as Aaron had to work that evening.    Monday July 26th Got up and went to the gym first thing in the morning on UT's main campus.  The gym is huge.  It's like 3 stories tall with racquetball courts, basketball courts, saunas, a pool, and a ton of workout equipment.  I just did my elliptical shit, then sat in the sauna for 10 minutes.  Those things are hot (duh), and always make me think of Goldeneye.  After we got back, we cleaned up and went to Amy's Ice Cream.  Which totally cancelled out our workout.  Aaron said it was better than Cold Stone Creamery, so I wanted to go to both of them.  I had some really chocolatey stuff that was amazingly creamy.  Mmmmmmm.  After that, we went over to Resolute Films, where Aaron works/interns.  No one was there except another intern who was asleep at her desk.  I found that quite comical.  There was a 20" Apple Cinema Display that I wanted to steal so bad.  There was another one that was a little smaller..17" or 18", but I could have done with that too.  I felt bad b/c 3 of the main computers in there were G4s or G5s, but I had no idea how to operate them.  I really need to expand my horizons.  Anyway, the owner, Isaac, wasn't there, so we left after 20 minutes.  Back to the house to chill for a bit, then we went to a differenty Trudy's....closer to campus.  It was kinda beat.  Ate some queso and drank some beers, then we headed downtown to another bar called Hole In The Wall.  It was packed with Emo kids.  I was bigger than most of them, so that was cool.  Some guy signaled me from across the bar that the girl he was sitting next to wanted to give me a blow job.  Aaron confirmed that she'd been staring at me for the past few minutes, but being the sexually inept person that I am, I just disregarded it and made no attempt to talk to her.  We left without meeting anyone.  Tuesday July 27th Went to a natural spring called Barton Springs.  It's like a park, and then they took a section of the spring and put ladders and a diving board on the sides so it was like a giant pool with no chlorine.  The water was a bit murky, and there were fish in it too.  I cut my foot on a rock and was sure I had gotten gangrene.  I realized how poor my cardio conditioning was when I tried to swim from one side to the other and only made it about 100 feet before I had to stop swimming and just float the rest of the way.  After that, we went to eat at the place called the Hula Hut.  Kinda reminds me of Harpoon Hannah's in Ocean City, only a bit smaller.  We ate on the deck, and birds kept walking by wanting table scraps.  I ordered nachos w/refried beans.  Mmmmm.  After that, we went to Cold Stone Creamery, because Casey told me that I need to go if I ever got the chance.  Well, I did.  It was really good, but I concur with Aaron that Amy's is better.  We then went to a vintage toy shop for shits and giggles.  I got some Chinese Finger Cuffs and an Albert Einstein action figure.  A lot of weird kids went in there too.  We then went back to Resolute to talk to Isaac.  He basically told me we were stupid for buying all that equipment when we could have just rented.  I told him no one in the area rents that shit, and he said most companies will FedEx the stuff to you.  D'oh!  After getting some more questions answered, he told us that if we send him a good script, he'll co-produce it for us.  Which basically means that we now have an inside track to a production company.  Like straight to the owner.  Now I just gotta make sure we write something good.  I have a bad feeling about our first short.  It's just not coming together like we'd hoped.  We shoot in a week.  Anyway, Austin and I are gonna work on some shorts after this one, and hopefully one will be "edgy" enough to get the real treatment.  Goddam, that's exciting.  Left Resolute (Isaac wants to see our current project when we're done with it) and went to see The Bournce Supremacy at the Alamo Draft House.  Basically, it's a movie theater with half the normal seating capacity, but you get waited on and have a real menu to choose from.  You have a little table in front of you and everything.  The food wasn't the greatest, but you can order beer/wine/apps/dinner if you're so inclined.  I think we need one of those here.  As a footnote, Bourne was a really good flick.    Wednesday July 28th Took off for Houston, as we bought tickets to see the Astros play against the Diamondbacks.  Roger Clemens started that night and destroyed the D-backs.  Took some pictures of Randy Johnson as well.  The stadium, Minute Maid Park, is very nice.  It's new and the dome was closed.  I prefer Camden Yards, but having temperature controlled baseball games was definitely a plus.  Houston is a very boring city.  We drove around a bit before hand and it was like the rapture had occured.  No one was around.  After the game, we drove 2+ hours back to Austin.  Thursday I flew home.

      Fuck.  I'm all ready to go to sleep so I can get up at 4:50am tomorrow.  My flight out of BWI is at 8:40, but I have to be there mad early, and it's like a 90 minute drive...give or take.  Now I'm all excited to be going and can't sleep.    Your body...is a port-o-potty. - Dave Chappelle Hitchoo wit no delayin' so whatchoo sayin' yo. - Busta Rhymes So kiss me hard, 'cause this will be the last time that I let you. - Dashboard  I've come to realize that I like some Emo music, but can't stand the requisites or the way any of those fags dress and/or act.  I read some emo rules that said you have to cry at least 3 times a day.  Can't we all just hit a bong?  I'm rambling...I'm out.

      I just made a post using my BlogThis! thingy, and when I went to submit it, the page timed out and the post never went.  That does not make me happy.  Anyway, Today I have to drive aaaaaaaaaall the way to Westminster, MD for work.  It's over a 2 hour drive there, then, I have to drive back.  Well, beach traffic is murder on Fridays, so it'll be a 3 hour drive back, I'm sure.  Fortunately, this will entail my entire day.  I'm about to map out directions real quick-like, and hit the road by 8:30ish.  I leave for Texas tomorrow, so I'm pretty stoked about that.  I bought some new clothes the other day.  New clothes make me feel pretty.  I got a haircut yesterday too.  Prim and proper and ready to party.  Well, not really much of a partier, but 6th Street in Austin IS the bomb.  It's kinda like Bourbon Street.  I'll take pictures (if I can get away w/it w/out looking like a tool).  My other post I was going to make was about the Ford GT.  I dunno what car that was on  urlLink Casey's  web site, but I like the Ford better.  0-60 in 3.2 seconds and a top speed of 210+.  Finally, something to replace el Viper.  I've loved it for 8+ years, but I've always been a Ford guy, so I've been torn.  Check it out  urlLink here .  Ok, time to brush my ass and wash my teeth.    BTW, most people's blogs on here are kinda boring.  I hope mine is diverse enough to be at least something you want to read occasionally.

       urlLink Garden State - Zach Braff Blog   This is Zach Braff's Blog that basically tells you about all the press he's doing for his new film, with some funny anecdotes to go along.  This is the movie I'm probably the most psyched about for the summer, following The Bourne Supremacy.  Maybe Austin and I can get Natalie Portman to act in one of our flicks?  Eh, maybe not.  The film looks amazing, going on the two trailers for it that I've seen thus far.  I dunno, it just exudes  feelings  for some reason.  And since I have to live daily pretending I HAVE no feelings, it's good to get some release every once in a while.  The fact that he wrote, directed, and starred in it gives me hope as well.  As recently as 2000, ole Zach was waiting tables in LA.  So, there is a chance for us all.  Let's see, he is 29 now, minus four years, puts him at 25, which is exactly how old I'll be in 2 months.  We'll have a better idea of how all this is going to go down after I visit Resolute Films (where my cousin works) and check out what actually happens in a production company, and after we shoot our short the following weekend.  We will learn from these things, and hopefully I'll finish my script sometime this year.  AICN trashed Catwoman.  I haven't read any other reviews, but I'm sure they're awful as well.  If you're reading this, I beg you, DO NOT GO SEE CATWOMAN.

       urlLink Stylus 410 Digital   Head out of gutter, please.  I just bought this digicam today.  It was $350 + $10 (Samsonite cam bag) + $75 (xD 128MB memory card).  It's a very slim camera, and was one of the lightest they had on display for any pixel count.  The 5.0 MP Olympus was kinda bulky.  Since I'm going to TX this weekend, I needed something to have memories with, as I probably won't be anywhere cool for at least another year.  Along with the lightness of it, the all-weather construct is a bonus too.  This means I can take pics in the rain or snow without getting all worried.  Maybe even take pictures as I shower...you know you wanna see.

      I've watched 1990-1997 so far, with '98 and '99 still on my Tivo, awaiting my viewing pleasure.  They air it so much (as they did with the '70's and 80's) that eventually, you watch all of them.  I hate watching TV in fragments, so I just queued them all up and have been systematically devouring them, one year at a time.  Anyway, just a few comments on some of the things on the episodes I've seen so far.  Naturally, I could comment on every fad and piece of pop culture, but we haven't the time for that, do we?  Michael Ian Black vs. Hal Sparks  These are VH1's go-to guys.  They show their comments much more than everyone else's.  I don't know what their reasoning is behind who gets more face time, but I'd like to know.  Sometimes people will pop up and make a comment and it'll be the only time you see them through the whole decade.  A.J. Langer has made 2 appearances so far. (MSCL anyone?)  So, who's funnier?  MIB (haha) is very very dry.  Not in a Dennis Miller kind of way, it's more in his delivery.  He hits gold every once in a while, but I think if you talk enough, eventually you'll say something funny.  You also have to wonder about his sexuality.  He obviously LOOKS very gay.  He played a very gay role in 'Red Hot American Summer', and he comments on gay things.  I don't care if he's gay or not, I'd just like to know.  He reminds me of M-A-Dollar Sign-E before he went all religious on us and now is back to rapping again.  He's someone you can only take in small doses.  I think I like Hal Sparks better, personally.  He's more like a normal guy, and he laughs when he says something funny.  Comedians that laugh at their own jokes are usually funnier.  I dunno, he just seems more normal.  The best part he did (so far) was when he did the Forrest Gump meets Slingblade.  That was '96 I think.  Hal plays(ed?) on that show Queer as Folk, but I've never seen it, so the gay question is out there too on him, if anyone has an answer.  Lastly, what the hell is M.C. Hammer talking about when he announces the hippity hoppity bells a boppity slammin' jammin' rollin' strollin' humpin' bumpin' stone cold munchin' hits of each year?  That guy has lost all touch with the Hip Hop community.  He's also wearing a Detroit jacket.  We ALL know he's from Oak-town.  It's like DMX recently representing the A-T-L.  He's from New York.  Also, has Hammer's head gotten bigger?  I'm not judging, as I have a monstrosity atop my shoulders, but when one's yoke noticably grows, I'm curious as to why.  "If you touch him in the right place, he'll giggle.  Then he'll cum."

      &nbsp;  urlLink Career stats.    I heard on ESPN last night that Al Leiter was almost eligible for the league lead in ERA. I thought to myself, "they must mean if it weren't for those two bad outings, or something of the sort". Well, I looked into it today, and he did not have 2 bad outings. He was hurt a little bit to start the season, but now has the 90 IP to qualify for the MLB lead in ERA at a paltry 2.24. So, I dug a bit further to look at his career stats. Here is a guy that has flown under the radar his entire career. He's not flashy. Doesn't post a lot of Ks. Has never won more than 17 games. He's not a good hitter, either. But if you'll notice, he missed some time early on in his career for the better part of 5 seasons. 13 games in 5 years. Let's look at the upside here, though. He averages approximately 140ish Ks per year. His career ERA is 3.63. He has 151 wins compared to 115 losses. In defense of the losses, he's played with Toronto, Florida (when they were not so good) and the Mets. I'm sure run support was an issue from time to time. If you add back 4 and a half seasons of pitching at the same cut, all of a sudden, Al Leiter has around 200 wins and 2500 Ks. (these are ballpark figures...get it, ballpark?) Do I think he'll continue to pitch at just a smidge above 2 in ERA? No. Will he win 20 games? Not with only 6 so far. Is he 39 and in the twilight of his career? For sure. Even though these numbers will not even come close to qualifying him for any type of awards (Cooperstown), I now have a newfound respect for the guy I never paid attention to.

      I've been busy as shit with work the past couple of days.  Friday I was in St. Michael's, MD installed a router, switch, and WAP, as well as testing them.  Then Monday I swapped out a Bay Systems router with a Cisco 831 in Newark, DE.  Yesterday, I was in Rehoboth at a house that must have cost a cool million, swapping out a Satellite modem.  Surprisingly enough, the modem took the longest time to complete because of VPN problems.  The guy that owned the joint is apparently a co-owner of  urlLink Hanley Wood, LLC , which is probably the reason he can see the Atlantic ocean from his 3 story beach property.  While I was there, they had some handy-man fixing a few things, and 3 cleaning ladies dusting and vacuuming.  Man, I can't wait until that's me.  (The rich part, I don't want to be a cleaning lady.)  All of this was outside of my normal scope of operations for the bank I usually work at, so I'm sure I've got 40 emails to answer when I get back to the office today.  FedEx shipped my new  urlLink mouse  yesterday.  I'm not a fan of wireless mice, but I do dig opticals.  That's why it took so long to find one I liked.  Since my case is black, I got a black mouse too.  Only the keyboard and monitor remain to be replaced.  It's hard to find a black ergonomic keyboard that isn't all gay, and I can't afford a 17" LCD just yet (or anytime soon, for that matter).   urlLink Casey  and I made a bet on Sunday (amount not to be disclosed) on who could get down to 190 pounds first.  I weighed in at 205.5 and he was 204.5 on Monday.  So far, I've done 45 minutes of cardio on Monday, with a little weight training.  Then, yesterday, I ran a mile in the morning, and ran some football routes for 45 minutes in the afternoon.  Did some crunches before bed.  This morning, I got up and ran a mile again.  My pace is very slow, but that's what happens when you're out of shape.  My legs are tired, but at least my knees don't hurt (yet(knock on wood)).  I have drills this weekend, so I have to get my hair cut.  I'll probably do that tomorrow.  I'll do it tonight if Joe doesn't want to play racquetball after he gets off work.  We shall see.  Austin got sick last week, and has had the funk ever since.  I started to get it, but when he left for the weekend, I got better.  Since he got back on Monday, I've been coughing more and hacking.  Mofo needs to get over that shit.  I hate being sick.

      I went with Rob to the Phillies vs. Giants game yesterday in the Iladelph. I stick to my guns that I don't like that city (though nothing's as bad as Motown). But, the tickets were free, and I would get to see Bonds play. Or so I thought. Bonds AND Thome were off yesterday. Bonds came in during the 7th or something to pinch hit, and then intentionally walked him. So, I got to see one of the best hitters in the history of baseball get walked with one out and no one on. I guess it's just too cool to walk Barry these days, and that's why everyone does it.     Our seats were kinda far away, but again, they were free.     Notice the cute girl behind me?  Mmmmmm fatties.  Anyway, the Giants won 7-6 (yay) and aside from 20 minutes of rain, it was a decent game.  I've started my Madden '05 Franchise on Xbox.  My fingers are still trained to play it on PS2 even though I've had it for like 5 days now.  Austin and I created a Franchise and are in week 3 of the preseason.  I am 2-1 (lost to the computer in week one, and barely eaked out a win over Austin in week 2) and he's 1-1-1.  I want to play online, but I'm not ready yet.  I hate losing, so anything that's going to track my record like that, I must wait to face.  I currently play on Pro mode, so I need to work up to All-Pro before I try to face some of these other Madden Masters.  The Redskins lost to the Panthers last night 23-20 in OT.  They played poorly overall...4 INTs, I believe, but to stay that close to the reigning NFC Champion is a good sign.  Maybe we can expect good things?

      That'd be our first indie short, folks.  Principal photography on the tentatively titled "Tough Calls" wrapped on Sunday afternoon.  Wow, what a fucking experience.  After work on Friday, I got home and we started going.  Making sure people showed up.  Keeping them fed.  Lights.  Camera.  Directing.  Finding things we forgot.  Finding people when others backed out or just didn't show.  Between 7pm on Friday and 4pm on Sunday, we were on location for over 20 hours out of the weekend.  We got 2 hours of footage, which will be pared down to about 10 minutes of film.  Couldn't have asked for better weather.  The humidity on Thursday was at like 80%.  On Friday, it dropped to nothing and was 72 degrees and sunny.  Saturday was the same way.  Sunday was a little warmer, but no more humid.  Of the 6 people that had any significant speaking roles, 4 of them were really good.  I won't name names, but some of them were less than inspiring.  We ran into a lot of problems that we had to figure out on the fly.  That was a little tougher, considering not a sole on the crew had ever done this before.  The talent was really impressed with our organization of the whole thing as well as the professionalism we conveyed.  At least, that's what they TOLD us.  So, now, we just have to get all the footage onto the computer and start editing.  Which will probably be a nightmare.  I downloaded Avid FreeDV video editing software so I could get my feet wet with it, while Austin edits the film on Adobe Premiere.  We've got a band to write some songs or ditties or whatever for it when we get it all pieced together, and hopefully we'll have it done in time for submission to some Film Festivals early next year.  After work calms down (surprisingly, I'm busy this week and next) and I get some Madden '05 playing time in, I'm going to start writing up MY directorial debut.    Anyway, the shoot was fun.  We all learned a ton, and will be better prepared for next time.  Even though I think we did a really good job on this one, we'll see how the footage ends up.  Please email me if you have any questions about what happened, or would like to check out some set photos...I took about 80.

      My two favorite things.  Football training camp started last week.  No major announcements have taken place yet, but the first game of the year is on September 9th.  Indy vs. New England.  This will be a rematch of last year's AFC Championship game, which NE obviously won.  It could have a lot of implications on how the playoffs will shape up this year.  Football season also begins the preparation for my fantasy football league(s).  I play in one main one, with a bunch of my friends (and always one or two guys I don't know).  This year we have 10 players, as opposed to the 12 we had last year.  I drafted for myself and Casey last year, and both our teams started 5-0.  He didn't keep up with it for the rest of the season, and ended up 6th overall.  I won the whole thing.  The guy who finished second is not playing this year.  Says he's not really that interested in it.  Oh well.  I think 8/10 that we have playing this year will be really gung-ho about it.  So, it should be fun.  I also signed up for a public league with an autodraft.  My team drafted last night and looks pretty solid.  Then, Bill and I come up with a league of him vs. me.  I only lost one game to him last year, although he had more total points.  Thus, I won the league.  He won't let it go that he had more points.  Bitch, if you wanted a points league, you should have played a points league.  So, I won two leagues last year, out of the 4 I played in.  As far as movies go, I got my 'O' Brother Where Art Thou' 11x17 poster yesterday.  I wish they made frames that size, because it's just in this plastic thing that reminds me of the baseball card holders from back in the day.  Kinda gay, but it'll have to do.  It hangs on the wall in my living room now.  From now on, I'll only buy full-size posters.  Austin, Rob, and I worked out some of the details of our shoot that's happening this weekend.  We brought Rob on as a "Production Manager".  Basically, he's going to have to make sure the sound and lighting is looking as good as we can get it to.  A lot of people are not willing to help, but when we're filming scripts with some real studios 18 months from now, they'll all be kicking themselves in the asses.  Enjoy yourselves.
