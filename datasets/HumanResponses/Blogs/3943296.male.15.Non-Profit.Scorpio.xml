      Hmmmmm... I don't actually know what I am going to post, but I will do it Ad Lib. We made a new song today to the tune of A Pizza Hut. It goes like this: "A big fat chicken, A big fat Chicken, a furry little rabbit and a big fat chicken. A big fat chicken, a big fat chicken. A furry little&nbsp;rabbit and a big fat chicken. AN AARDARK AN AARDVARK, a furry little rabbit and a big fat chicken. AN AARDVARK AN AARDVARK, a furry little rabbit and a big fat chicken." (repeat as many times as amuses) Oh and me and Josh (yeah I know Josh and I. You're just like my mum.) designed a pencil case with Arthur the Aardvark on it. Well it wasn't the trashy rubbish Arthur the Aardvark off the BBC who looks more like a mouse and the only reason he's&nbsp;called an Aardvark is cos Arthur the mouse sounds rubbish. This was the real Arthur the Aardvark. He had a real snout and was gobbling up ants at the rate of 10 to a dozen. hmmmmm...I'm bored. Camp in 2 days. Yay. I don't think anyone actually goes on this site anyway. Huh who cares. YOU ALL SUCK. Well with the exception of a few choice people. (NO GEORGE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE YOU.) well i'm even more bored than when i started this blog.   Why? Why? Why? Only you hold the answers.

      This morning we had to wake up really early just to go and pick my sisters up from Wales.  That poor excuse for a country.&nbsp;I enjoyed a peacefull week without them only to discover i had to go and pick them up.  I on the other hand didnt have a flash of inspiration. Not for the past day anyway. Not since the great inspiration of the 1990s where i was so inspired i decided to be born. Some say this was the greatest piece of inspiration ever to grace the planet. Others however, were not so optomistic. I am officially out of ideas about what to blog. I will now shut up. Hope springs eternal.

      Last night, while eating,&nbsp;I had a flash of inspiration: Cuthbert the Custard Cream. Yes as I ate another poor victim of my greed, I decided to write a short memorandum to Cuthbert the Custard Cream. He was a very good custard cream. He wasn't soggy. He hadn't been bashed around. He wasn't past his sell-by date. All in all he was just another custard cream in the wall. He had probably lived only for about 2 or 3 months. He still had another few weeks before he finally started to absorb the moisture in the air, and start to go soggy (providing he was kept lovingly in an air tight tin). And here was I, a cruel human at the top of the food chain, and I cut his life short. As I crunched the life out of him he squeaked: "Please don't eat Caroline the Custard Cream." Alas his warning came too late as I crushed another hapless Custard Cream in an outright display of wanton distruction. As an act of sorrow for 2 (well about 6 really) Custard Creams, I am going to send out a petition to end the holocaust against the Custard Cream. Please support this noble work. I expect my honourary degree and knighthood for this kind work soon.

      This morning witnessed a great event.  &nbsp;Several of the yp at our church were being baptised. This includes the other blogger Josh Mackenzie. People turned up in thousands, well, about 150 or more. The interesting thing for me was&nbsp;to see that as soon as each peron hit the water, even herself, Becki would start crying.  Not just her but as i turned around all the girls&nbsp;were crying aswell. It is obviously an emotional&nbsp;for family and friends, but i noticed that everyone who was crying was a female.  Women, typical.   For future baptisms i reccomend the emersion of aardvarks. Truly this would bring together a large multitude people.  As you can see this is the first time i've blogged in the past 3 days. Man&nbsp;my summers been boring.&nbsp;

      Yesterday we set out at a very early 9:30&nbsp;AM to get to Crewe Station.  Purpose? To go out for the day&nbsp;to Llandudno.  It&nbsp;was, all in all, a great day. We started off by going to a beach predominantly covered by rocks. To our great pleasure, we found out that there was actually a sandy part. As you do when you go to the seaside, we tried to build a sand barrier to keep out the sea, didn't work though. We then went to Happy Valley, and were very happy to ride on the tobogans.  By far the highlight of the day was me winning&nbsp;a big fluffy monkey which said&nbsp;I love you. only took me about 3 goes. Aid spent loads of money on it and didn't&nbsp;win anything. HA HA!  Anyway the whole trip was a success. I am now tired of blogging and am now going to cook a tomato in batter.   (once again spelling corrected by the clever one) (oh yeah)

      Hey, I am bored too. The wonder of blogging is growing thin. We went to llandudno yesteday. It was very nice. We went to happy valley and we were very happy. (no there were no drugs involved). :(&nbsp; errrm. i wrote lots of songs with Aardvark in. Well rewrote lots of songs with Aardvark in. Like Angels by Robbie Williams: "I sit and Wait. There's an Aardvark." Or " While Shepherds watched their Aardvarks by night. All seated on the ground" errm. Or "Scabadabadeebadeeebalyueuiry I'm an Aardvark..." Or "All the Aardvarks" (all the small things by Blink 182 that great band. or: "Aardvarks came out of the water, She was feeling so bad cos she knows." (spies by coldplay) Or "talking to the Aardvark yesterday" (Songbird by Oasis. Man am I bored. Not as bored as I was in Crewe the other day. We (Jon, Josh and I) were going to Watch Spiderman 2 with some other people but we had to wait 2 hours in Macdonalds. We made a chain out of straws and did lots of bizarre things with some Wheetos. And insulted some Scallys. But Spiderman 2 was good. I highly recommend it. Errrm. yes goodbye. Well what are you waiting for? Go and Buy an Aardvark.

      Finally, the add about gays has gone. Took long enough.  I really am bored now. This has been the most boring days in a long time.  We went to the field, but everyone decided to be lazy and go home after 1 hour. Then we all went round to aids and played on Nightfire for ages. We also were so bored we actually watched the Rugrats(thanks to Aid). I am now bloggin just to try and entertain myself. Then I'll play on internet games for a bit.  What a fun day I've had.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Hurry up Josh and make a blog, I've blogged the last 3!

      Without doubt one of the great comedies of all time.  Not only is it humorous, but contains many truths for life.&nbsp;Here&nbsp;is my favourite quote by him,  &nbsp;  Blackadder, ' To late one thinks of what one should have said.&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;More,&nbsp;for instance, burned alive for refusing&nbsp;to recant his catholicism, must have been kicking himself as the flames licked&nbsp;higher, that it never occurred to him&nbsp;to say ' I recant my catholicism'.   What a great quote.

      As i was eating my breakfast this morning, I delved into a boxful of books kindly given by CJ and i picked out a book called: "Beecham Stories" Anecdotes, sayings and impressions of Sir Thomas Beecham. He was apparently a conductor. Here's a few:  To a trombone player: "Are you producing as much sound as possible from that quaint and antique drainage system which you are applying to your face?"  Of one of the Walkure Soprano's, Beecham said her singing reminded him of a cart coming downhill with the brake on.  Beecham stopped a rehearsal of Die Meistersinger to ask the tenor singing Walther: "Do you consider yours is a suitable way of making love to Eva?" "Well, there are many different ways of making love, Sir Thomas." "Observing your grave deliberate motions," said Sir Thomas, "I was reminded of that estimable quadraped. the hedgehog."  All hail (another) great man.

      The reason for this title is simple, A) There aren't any great women, because women are generally rubbish at being great. I happen to be in regular contact with some of these women.  B)  I have decided to celebrate great men.  Its not that I'm gay or anything, I just want to celebrate and accuse people of overlooking some great men.  There's been Caeser, Alexander the Great, and of course Winston Churchill. I want to accuse people of overlooking great men. Jesus for example, was mocked and maimed. The most overlooked perhaps, is the mighty Gary Neville.  Without a doubt should have won world player of the year. Despite being one of the best players to grace the planet, he is still highly under rated. This is an awful way to treat such a class player. OUT WITH HENRY IN WITH NEVILLE.  (Spelling corrected by the clever one, or should that be the one who isnâ€™t thick?)

      I just complained about the gay add on the top of our blog. (Not cos i'm bothered just cos i was bored) Here's what I sent:   I am very displeased with the Gay advert at the top of my blog. I am a homophobe and a member of the "Anti-gay society" Do I have to pay for an add free blogspot? (apologies if you're gay) (well you should apologise to me) (down with gays)  Hint for level 5: Shoot the chickens until there dead

      I have decided (seeing as i am now off for 7 weeks) that i will finish off Wayne Grudems Systematic Theology. I'm already halfway through and i can't think of a better way to spend the summer. Well other than annoy eddy, and eat lots. And sing "love is only an Aardvark" (That's our new themesong by the way Josh. I just decided.) Sing it it fits in. Then realise how completely and utterly foolish you look and hope no one is looking.  The first flush of youth was upon you when our eyes first met And i knew that to you and into your life i had to get i felt light-headed at the touch of this strangers hand an assault my defences systematically failed to withstand  cos you came at a time  when the pursuit of one true love in which to fall was the be all and end all  love is only an Aardvark (drifting away) when im in your arms i start believing (its here to stay) but love is only an Aardvark Anyway  I just tidied my bedroom. It's now tidy. And it's my bedroom. JOSHUA IS YOUR BEDROOM TIDY? OPEN THE CURTAINS! ahem. I wonder who called Melons, Melons? Maybe mr Melons called Melons Melons. I will now shut up.

      Yay, as of 3 o clock i have no schoolwork for the next 7 weeks. Bliss. Just got my baptism to worry about now. Thats my bit for life done. Now for the universe bit: Stephen Dawkings or whatever he's called, had some random theory about black holes (which probably involved the big bang or some other ridiculous theory involving primordial soup, monkeys, and the missing link) well whatever his theory was (which he had defended for 30 years)it was wrong (HA) and he had to admit it. That's the universe. Now for Aardvarks: well i have to go now. Shame. I was going to post something from blackadder which was remotely involved with aardvarks. Happy easter one and all

Well, this is my first ever post in the whole wide world ever on this site so I will make it a good one. hmmmm... yep. i have been on this for 2 mins and mum wants me to come off. I have never actually seen a picture of an aardvark. It has a cool name though. I'm supposed to put something random and funny but my wit has left me on this particular occasion.

So if your out there, beware.&nbsp;  I will&nbsp;also show my happiness by blogging.  Going to yp soon. No doupt this will involve strange games and fights with Will.&nbsp;  Jon is now doing our garden. I better go and help&nbsp;him.

      Before we go into the tale of Cuthbert the Custard Cream i have some exiting news. The Thorleys got a swimming pool! it is about 3ft deep and is mint. Me, Aid and Josh, or should i say Josh, Aid and i shall be in it every day for 2 weeks. Now, on to our main story.  In a valley far far away was an ancient power. One so powerfull he could rule the earth, but instead decides to use his powers to protect the human race. Many people know him as the masked defender, others the rampant son of an AARDVARK MAN , but to those blessed few Know him as... CUTHBERT THE CUSTARD CREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He was reading the daily crunch as he did everyday, sitting eating as he did everyday, when he felt a large shudder. He decided this was just a crashing of the earths plates which would bring China and the U.S.A. into 1 nation... as he did everyday. Little did he know there was a sinister evil aproaching earth. A cousin of the Uber-Pea, theUber-Wedgie, who's only aim in life was to wedgie each and every custard cream on the face of the biscuit tin. Plus a few harmless Aardvarks. BOOM, BOOM, BOOM. The town heard it, in fact everyone on the face of the biscuit tin heard it. That is, all except Cuthbert.                                                                                    " Wedgie's gonna get ya,                                      Wedgie's gonna get ya"  Will Cuthbert hear this menace, wiil he come and save his people, could this be any more exciting? Tune in tomorrow for the 2nd part of Cuthbert the Custard Cream!!!! (No custard creams were harmed in the makin of this story, except the ones who got in a fight with Aarthur the Aardvark ,but thats for another time. A wedgie got dewedgified and a news reporter was flattened, but dont worry, it wasnt Trevor Macdonald.

      I must have been right cos my brother agrees with me and he's doing Hebrew and Biblical studies at St Andrews next year so who are all you to argue? I was right anyway. Jesus' teaching is more on the heart rather than on the actions. You can not go out with someone and lust after them, but you can go out with someone and not lust. It's all about the heart. Not having something generally makes you want it even more. Just so with people. At the end of the day what matters is not whether you're going out with someone, but with your heart. I agree that relationships shouldn't just be for kicks. They should be taken seriously and prayed about. But just as with the doctrine of election where people are either saved or not saved, we still need to put effort in. Concerning election we could just sit back and take it easy and say "It's ok. God will save who he wants without us anyway so we don't need to do anything" (if this is your view sorry BUT YOU'RE WRONG!) We can do the same with relationships. Sit back and say "it's ok. God will provide the "lamb". I don't need to do anything. We still need to put the effort in. All relationships should be God-centred, and should build both people up who are in it. If it causes people to sin by doing something "dodgy" then 1 Corinthians 10:13 should be remembered: "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it." That seems pretty obvious that it's your own fault if you succumb to temptation. Thoughts please...

      Here we go... Martha was a moomin of estimable proportions. The other moomins called her "Noah's Ark" as her dimensions nearly exactly matched those given in genesis 6. She had a best friend though called Aarthur the Aardvark, whom she regularly visited at Arnolds Aardvark 'Aven. They often went on great adventures and returned in time for tea. One time they protected the world from an invasion of deadly ants: Martha sat on them then Aarthur Ate them. They formed a club: The society for people who are excluded from the world because of their gigantic proportions. (even though Aarthur only weighed 3 stone. He was just in it for mutual support) They met every thursday afternoon in the very large field so that Martha could attend. The meeting revolved around eating. Maybe a little light exercise was undertaken to build the ego, such as walking to the shops to buy more food. One lovely day, Aarthur and Martha were sitting down doing nothing in particular when along came a vole called Noel. He was really a very nice Vole. He obeyed the law and only fouled on a verge once when he had to go or burst. Suddenly each started singing "Sugar Puff Wee" entirely of their own accord. Bound together by the mutual singing of this all time classic they did something which i can't think of cos it's my tea now and i'm starving. Huh, ignorant savages. DUCK! QUICK! Phew saved your life. you owe me one.

      I believe our blog is falling into the trap that many succumb too: that of becoming too serious and philosophical. We are starting to lose our sheer stupidity and we haven't mentioned Aardvarks for at least 2 blogs. We are on the slippery slope to becoming another mundane blogspot. After my well thought out analasis of our condition i will now try to combat it with a post of sheer stupidity and randomness. I really have built this up so I will try not to make this an anticlimax. Ahem... Words fail me. Oh I know. A joke i invented: What do you call a constipated cow? A cow. Geddit? oh well never mind. Isn't it ironic that people in prison always seem to win the lottery. If i did the lottery i would commit a minor offence (such as killing Edwina) then the chances of me winning would be much higher. But i don't do the lottery anyway so there goes that plan. I've gotta go to London tomorrow for the whole weekend. :( I really don't want to go as I have to go to the British Museum. But there's more chance of Shelbourne drawing with Deportivo La Coruna than me being allowed to stay. Hmmm looks like i'll have to put my stupidity into another post. If stupidity was a mouse then this post is a cheesecake.

      Im really looking forward to the weekend when the premiership season kicks off. This is partly because the football so far , generally has been quite poor. First of all Manu lost to Arsenal on Sunday ( not that i watched it of course, being the undoubtedly holy person that i am :p) , then i found out that there was no football on Monday. To add to my alredy gloomy week, Liverpool go and win their champions legue match yesterday. Im sure that United will cheer me up tonight. Anyway thats really all i have to say. See you around

      Just out of interest who posted a comment on my previous post? A relationships talk eh? I've had enough of them to last me for the rest of my life. They are all different and all disagree. Some say "No holding hands or any special attention til engagement." Others have a more carefree approach to it all, "As long as you don't do anything dodgy or hurt people then it's fine." And here I am stuck in the middle of a war between the Abstainers and the No problems. I think both sides are wrong personally. I think if you abstain then you might never get someone. That is taking into account the fact that God can easily provide someone whenever he pleases. But as Norman Gilbert helpfully preached on camp we are to "send out our doves". Yes God is in control over all events, but that doesn't mean we can just sit back and do nothing. We must put effort in and "send out our doves" (As Noah did. The rain had stopped and it was all in God's hands and down to his timing, but Noah sent out a Raven a couple of doves) And the "No problem" view is wrong because it encourages you to take relationships casually and not treat them with the sincerity that they deserve. On the one hand you have christians just standing out to be different, and on the other they are conforming to the worlds view. I think it is a matter of "each to his own conscience" as was the case with the food sacrificed to idols in 1 corinthians 8. And we should not force our views on others as the absolute standard as some in Corinth were doing, offending the weaker brothers. It is an area were there can be differences of opinion without compromising on any Christian truths or standards. Well that was a bit deep. I'm quite exhuasted. Go on, disagree. See if I care.

      Hi. In the words of the great Samwise Gamgee: "Well, Oi'm barck" (spelling purposely like that unlike my fellow blogger who does it by accident) Camp was great. It was the best yet (maybe thats just cos a person was there who hasn't gone before :P) the weather was ok mainly. A bit a drizzle, but Sat, Sun, Thurs, Fri, and Sat were all really hot. Norman Gilbert spoke very well on Noah, and drew in a lot of very helpful parallels between the flood and salvation. Duke was, as always, absolutley hilarious. He is one of a kind. Only Duke could get agitated about lost property and accuse people of being "too embarrassed to claim their last socks". Only Duke could really take seriously a game of Chubby Bunnies. Only Duke could enforce all the Laws made by Rob. Only Duke could blow his whistle 24/7. Only Duke could laugh at Rob's jokes. The chubby bunny episode was the funniest. He was against Norman Gilbert who is about 4 foot high and 4 foot wide at the shoulders, who used to play rugby and is still a meataxe. And the girl putting the marshmellows into his mouth was really amusing too. Rather than just placing them in she tried to throw them in like you would feed an animal that bites. And there was Duke with his cheeks all puffed out, and Norman in stitches at Dukes expression everytime the girl who was feeding him missed his mouth. Aah good old Duke. For my tent leaders i had Luke Plant and Xavier Alligand. Xavier was French and had been on the camp before as well so he just slept all the time. Luke did some really good bible studies. And Nath was there. We went to the loo 5 times in a row. We went to the urinal then washed our hands then back to the urinal then back to wash our hands, then we went for a dump, then washed our hands then back to the urinal and then back to wash our hands then back to the urinal again and then back to wash our hands. All this took about 30 mins and annoyed at least 30 people. One time we just stood there to annoy people and one little Kid said "PLeeeeeeeease can you hurry up." Then there was Fiona's "Gentle" walk on the sunday which consisted of walking up a really steep hill, coming to a fence and realising there wasn't a stile, then wandering round a huge field until we found it. Fortunatley i didn't go on her "moderate" walk in which she got everyone lost and it ended up being 8 miles long. Campers vs Officers wasn't really memorable. They had a really good team, and we had a really rubbish team, to cut a long story short. We got beaten 4-1 but we will prevail next year. And then the female campers (at least i think they were all females but with some of the haircuts this year you couldn't be too sure really) played the female officers in a primary school style, everybody-run-after-the-ball-and-try-to-kick-it-but-miss mess of people. They were beaten on penaltys as the officers shots could reach the goal. The campfire was good but we weren't allowed to stay out for long. On thursday night the sky was really clear and Nath and I nicked a bench and looked at the stars till 1 cos Luke had gone Bivvying and Xavier was inevitably asleep. We watched the moon-rise which was really nice, and then some really nice clouds came and we lit up by the moon. It was hauntingly beautiful. Now here I am back in Winterley, looking forward to a good long sleep.

      Were back! All of you who read are blog will notice we haven't blogged for a week! We went on A CCIW camp for a week. The speaker was Norman Gilbert, who spoke on the life of Noah. Every morning we had a service and every evening a bible study. These were both very helpfull. As well as these we did several activities including several gentle walks, and several not so gentle walks. One of the highlights of the week was going into towyn and going into the sauna, first time in ages. So mush did we enjoy it that we went in 2 days later. Yesterday we went to Aberduvi, and i got sunburnt. It still really hurts. The day before that we went to Barmouth and had an officer hunt. I was very suprised to see Chuckie dressed up as a female surfer. Intresting choice of costume. This morning we Said our final goodbye's and set off. All in all it was a great camp. Have a good one .
