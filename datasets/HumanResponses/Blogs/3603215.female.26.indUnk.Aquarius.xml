       Oh boy what a day!  Today is a Monday.  Again.  Same old work.  Same old me.   Funny how weekends seem to pass you by in a breeze.  Funny how weekdays drag by, so it seems.   Funny how I've been subjecting myself to this same old, boring, brainly but fairly good-paying job for years...while a fellow colleague who has barely been with the department for a year will be leaving soon...in less than a month's time...to join another company that would give her more opportunities...and a bigger take-home pay, of course.   It really saddens me that she'll be leaving soon.  I've been enjoying her company for quite a while.  She has been very frank in expressing her opinions, day-to-day experiences, and moodswings.    I'll surely miss her.  But that's how things are. I wish I could be as bold as she is.  I wish I could muster enough courage to face change seriously.  Do you know that indecision is worse than making a wrong decision?  Well I know, and yet I still chose to play it safe.  Waiting for the perfect moment...which never comes.   Maybe I'll just let this spiritual decay eat me up until I disappear.

       Finally, I got myself a blogspot!    I got it coz my friend has one and wants me to have one as well.  It's that simple.  In fact I don't even know what "blog" means exactly.  But it does sound cute. Blog. Rhymes with frog and fog. Well, that doesn't make any sense either... Perhaps that's the reason why blogs were created...for bored, lonely souls to express their senseless musings...their randoms thoughts...their inner dreams and deepest desires...their darkest secrets...  So now, where should I start?  Maybe I should start with my state of being lonely despite not being alone. Oh yes, I am lonely.  I'm Miss Lonely.  I have nobody, to call my own...  A typical week constitutes my doing the following activities: I go to work, I go to school, I chat with my colleagues, I chat with my classmates, I chat with YM & MSN friends, I go out with friends on weekends, I study a bit, and I eat, I eat, and I eat...and that's it.   Pretty boring life...I must say.  Since that one fateful October night three years back when we (me and my ex) officially broke up...I had been lonely...and disillusioned...and empty.  Gone were the days when I had someone to turn to...when I could simply look for one person to make my day complete, talk to one person whom I can share all the aspects of my life with, whether . Boy, I was like that...the ever trusting, gullible, little shy girl.   Since then, I have learned from the mistakes of my past.  I have learned not to rely my happiness on one person.  They say that true happiness comes from within.  So that's what I've been pursuing.  True happiness.  I've engaged myself in all sorts of activities.  I have enrolled myself in grad school, I have learned to drive independently, I've gone out-of-the-country without my family, I have been gimmicking also every weekend with my female friends.  I have become more and more adventurous.  All of these because I want to be happy with myself.    And yet it's so difficult to find happiness...the more you seek it, the more it eludes you.  Maybe I should just be contented with what I have now.  But how could I when I don't have a dear someone to share all my fears, sadness, failures, joy, and laughters with?    Often, I wonder, will there ever be someone right for me and I for him?  When would the right time come? Is there such a time? Or was I destined to be alone forever?   I dunno the answer yet...so in the meantime, I'll probably try to book myself with more activities so that I could get my mind off those lonesome sad thoughts... *bow*
