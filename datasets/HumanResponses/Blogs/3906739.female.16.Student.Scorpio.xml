         This picture for me represents success because it seems that everyone is getting to know each other. It relates to college in a way that seems that they're talking about going to college or university.It makes me wonder what are they disscussing or what are theirs plans or theirs goals, it also makes think more about college and what I'm going to do in the future or what college or university is the best for me.

        For this past 3 weeks I've been in the Blast program and I think its really great. You get to know people from different schools and you also get to learn about the country they're from.&nbsp; The classes here are really interesting, we don't have to do homework becuase all we do is work in groups to get to know each other. The teachers are really nice and they always are smiling .One of the best part of this program is that we get to go on field trips every thursday, this last&nbsp;two thursday we went to the park and the zoo we're also going to six flags. I feel that this program is going to help to find the right college for me because the teachers are helping us to look for the college that is right for us. The questions that I always&nbsp;ask myself is how would I be able to afford college or the universy?and would I be able to go to college or university?&nbsp;are the teachers going to be like in high school ? how am I going to get there?how much do I have to   pay  ?. &nbsp;&nbsp;

           BLAST INQUIRY ESSAY    Coming to  Blast    program has help me understand why I should go to college or university. first I thought that college wasn’t for me because &nbsp;maybe I wasn’t prepare to go or I would do wrong. The thing is that I was afraid because of all the things I heard, people said that the teachers are mean. I also thought about the questions that I needed to answer and what I fear most, my questions are, how would I pay for college? What do I need to go to college? Should I learn to get money or to become educated?.&nbsp;The teachers has&nbsp;also helped me to understand why is important to be educated, they help us to find information about&nbsp;college or university that might be right for us. At the program is really great because we don't always work on the internet to find information about college, we get into groups and play games to learn from&nbsp;each other. Field trips are the best part of it. We've  been&nbsp;to  Washington     Park&nbsp;  were we learn how to work as a team and to listen to each others opinion, the next field trip was at the&nbsp;  Linconl Park Zoo  which we learn about the animals habits and how they survive in their world,my favorite field trip was when we learn how scientist separate protons into atoms at    Fermilab .&nbsp;We still have two more field trips to go, one is to the  Museum of Science and Industry ,  and the one I'm looking forward to go is to  Six Flags   . Its been really great, and&nbsp;my favorite class is poetry/writing,&nbsp;at first I didn't like writing poetry because I wasn't good at it and now I can come up with a poem and I write more than I used to&nbsp;write.&nbsp;In poetry we had to&nbsp;take pictures that represnt success to us,&nbsp;in the picture were my friends&nbsp;in a group and in the middle was Alfonso, one of the teachers. The picture represents success&nbsp;for me because I wonder if they're disscussing about their future or talking about their plans, it also makes me think about my future and what are my plans for now that I'm in high school. My&nbsp;future plans for now are to go to a good university and&nbsp;to study computer&nbsp;engineering.But for now I'm just planning to finish high school and&nbsp;to get prepare to go to a university, and to find a good&nbsp;job, and information about the university that I'm interesting in.I'm really looking forward to study at a good university and learn as much as I can, to support my family. The&nbsp;Blast program is a really good help for me because I&nbsp;now I can decide which college or university is the best for me, and where would I go to study what&nbsp;I'm really&nbsp;interesting in, but the only thing&nbsp;that I'm really worried about&nbsp;is how&nbsp;am I going to pay for my studies, am I going to have any help from someone or am I going to have to pay for my own. I think that&nbsp;gear-up is&nbsp;the best program that&nbsp;I have ever been, it helped you meet new people, learn from one another, and listen to each other opinions. I'm really happy that&nbsp;I join the blast program ever since I was in the 7th grade. The only thing that I don't like about the program is the food that they gave us when we go on field trips, other than that I don't have anything else to say about this fascinating and exciting program,&nbsp;and I hope that everyone who joins the program thinks the way I think about the&nbsp;program BLAST.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp;       &nbsp;
