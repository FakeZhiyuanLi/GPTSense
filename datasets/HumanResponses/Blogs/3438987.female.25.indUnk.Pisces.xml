       I've now lived in the space between an old way of life and a new for 7 weeks.  Rather than experience change as a single instance, I took a break between the end of my old experiences and the beginning of new ones.    Leaving the old wasn't hard but I'm about to jump into the new (well, the short-term new) and it scares me.    I don't know what exactly is so scary about it-- I will be seeing familiar people in the next 2 months, staying in my country, and returning to a familiar city.  But I find myself crying for no reason, thinking at times of turning back, and almost dreading the fantastic summer I've planned.  A known quantity is always less scary than the unknown.    This is the last deep breath before the plunge.  I've done similar things before, and I know the pattern.  When I get in the car to leave DC, I will cry, maybe a lot.  Then, worn out and calm again, will resign myself to the next hours-- not excited, but doing it, doing what I had planned to do.  Slowly over those hours, the resignation will dissipate as I remember that not only did I choose to take this trip, it is what I dreamed of doing for 2 1/2 corporate years, what others keep telling me they'd love to do, and what I may never have the chance to do again.  Before being on the road becomes routine, I will enjoy the juxtaposition of grief and excitement, of leaving the old and moving towards the new.

        First hour on the road :  Depending on the time of day, some degree of pop is appropriate; happy-to-be-driving (or need-to-wake-up) music.  Try U2's Pop, Flaming Lips, or (gasp) top 40 radio.   In the groove :  Calming, Zen-- you're changing lanes with ease, thinking about putting it into cruise.  Try Beck's new album, classical if you're so inclined.   OK... :  You've been driving awhile.  Well into the trail mix, you feel the need for a little energy-- angry energy.  Although you're not angry, you listen to keep from looking at every mile marker, totalling the number of hours your legs have been in a single position, or blowing up at the crazy truckers.  So many options here:  Def Lepperd, Bon Jovi, Radiohead, Eminem...truly endless.  You could drive angry for awhile  You think you're back to Zen :  and you might try something a little calmer.  But you're wrong.    Can Not Wait to get out of the car :  Nothing will do here but oldies/soul-- you've got to belt it out with Diana Ross, Marvin Gaye, or Aretha.  As you pull off the highway, you're back to happy.

       I imagine it is impossible to stand out in Portland, just as it is impossible to look like everyone else.  When I pierced my eyebrow and went to work at the Corporate Executive Board, I stood out.  Here nobody would blink an eye, and I might even fit in a bit better.  There's a weird sort of homogeny to a city full of nonconformists.    Yesterday I did everything Portland-- spent a lot of time in Powell's City of Books (where they have a ceiling-to-wall shelf full of books about FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt), bought fruit from a farmer's market, sat outside with a cup of coffee to watch people, went to yoga (where I almost passed out, then walked into the men's changing room...luckily I turned around in time to avoid too much awkwardness and luckily Portlanders are pretty chill anyway), got a $1.50 haircut (which the guy who's cut my hair twice in DC will groan over...he's been "nursing my hair back to health").  That evening I did everything Hostel-- sampling the current resident cook's masterpiece, helping out with a sidewalk chalk masterpiece, and talking for hours and hours on the huge porch.  I could stay in Portland for awhile.   I really wish I had brought a tape recorder to keep record of what I'm thinking.  When I'm not driving there's too much going on to journal intensively, and I can't possibly bore you all with the waves and waves of thought about life, travel, work, the US, etc. etc. etc.  If I could just talk as I drove (when I'm thinking most anyway) I might be able to capture those thoughts (I'm always brilliant when I don't have a pen around).

       I can't imagine a better shower than after 4 days of driving, hiking, and sleeping in my clothes.  I was on the road north into Oregon today and couldn't handle it any longer.  For those who have never taken a shower at a truck stop (I was one of you until today), put away your skepticism.  Clean floor, clean towels, a secure lock on the door-- and only a bit unnerving to hear the voices of truckers right outside as I showered.    I hiked the old growth forest in California yesterday-- there's something comforting about those huge moss-covered trees that seem to melt into the soft ground. I also stayed at a campground where I could watch the seals play in the ocean, then watch the sun set and turn everything pink.

       I made it!  All the way from DC (where I saw the Atlantic Ocean about a month ago) to San Francisco!  What a great city-- and even more interesting than usual on Pride weekend.  I've spent a few hours wandering here, and will head north soon, making my way for the next several days along the coast of California then Oregon.    It's a pretty cool experience to be on highways across the country.  The hiking and friend-visiting along the way is actually the better part, but harder to describe (hikes in brief:  sky in shades of blue, mountains and hills, tiny alpine wildflowers and other colorful things, chipmunks, etc.  I spend much of my hiking time-- and driving, too-- gasping in wonder, or smiling with this goofy smile because it's so great).  Interstates might not show you everything about a state, but certainly something:    Maryland:  OK, I don't remember Maryland.  It was the first 3 hours of the trip.  I was playing Def Lepperd.  Pennsylvania:  what other state makes you pay $14 in tolls just to take the only major cross-state highway?   Ohio:  literally the best rest stops I've ever experienced.  Michigan:  I've done this drive so much I can hardly talk about it.  It is what it is.  Indiana:  Indiana is the signal to get excited for Chicago:  only 50 miles to go.  Illinois:  I maintain that Illinois is the absolute most boring state to drive through, even just east to west.  Even in Nevada you can pretend you're driving on another planet.   Nebraska:  this state has to borrow landmarks from other states (take this highway to get to the Badlands!) Colorado:  what to say about CO?  I love it!  Curvy moutain roads, high passes, some desert.  Everything wonderful.  Utah:  surprisingly varied-- there actually is a national forest in Utah, as well as salt fields and mountains.  Nevada:  like I said, at least you can pretend you're driving across the moon or something.  The only time I used cruise control and air conditioning.  California:  excessive signage telling everyone exactly how to drive.  One long and mostly beautiful downhill towards the ocean.

       OK, I have to be honest.  For the first time yesterday, I didn't really want to be doing this anymore.    When I started planning the trip, I thought it might be hard somehow.  Actually, there's nothing hard about it-- I make decisions easily, don't need much to live on or be happy, and get to spend as much time as I want, doing the best things in the world.  Sometimes I think I could do this forever.    On the other hand, what am I doing, really?  In the middle of the desert I started to feel like Epicurus's collection of particles, bouncing around the country in my little particle car.  If I had a job, a destination, or just something to tie me down, I'd feel secure with a sense of purpose.    I'm experiencing a weird paradox in this freedom-- on one hand, I'm the luckiest person around to be able to do this.  On the other hand, it's isolating and I struggle at times to find meaning.  It's funny how I've been able to reduce life to the basics (OK, the basics plus cell phone and computer), but that hasn't really reduced the complexity of life.  I think I like it; after all, if life weren't complicated, where would the excitement be?  I wouldn't have anything to think about on the road.

       I got to Crested Butte, CO yesterday when the sun was low in the sky, the photographer's favorite hour.  I made dinner at the isolated campsite and wondered who belonged in the only other tent at the site.  After dark, a car pulled in with a kayak on top and two men inside, who proceeded to get drunk and loud, and to do something involving hammering until late into the night.    I got up when the sun rose, as I always do, and didn't want to lay in bed any longer;  there was frost on the outside of the tent, and I'd spent the entire night curling into a tighter and tighter ball in hopes of warming up in the sub-30-degree weather.  As I drove out of the campsite I considered laying on the horn for awhile to give the guys my farewell, but there were deer in the campsite I didn't want to scare away.  I went for a long hike-- almost 6 hours around the side of a moutain, giving me views of all the wildflowers and the Maroon Bells.    At 1PM I could think of nothing I wanted more than a nap.  Crested Butte has a nice park with baseball fields, tennis courts, and a picnic area.  I avoided all these and the playground, and found a nice spot in the middle of a field.  Perfect-- a nap in the grass on a sunny, 72-degree day.  I was in a warm, sleepy place when a buzzing noise started and the lawn sprinklers went on.  Somehow avoiding a direct hit, I staggered (lightly sprinkled) away from the sprinklers, and lay down again near a deserted basketball court.  Within minutes someone with an unfortunately inaccurate shot came by to shoot hoops.  I decided to ignore this, until I heard two of the playground voices come closer and a kid fairly close to me say "Just a minute I'm going to the bathroom."  At this point I decided napping in the park just wasn't a wise move.    There are all kinds of things to do in this town but for today I'm not sure I have the wherewithall to do anything but wander around.  Maybe tomorrow I'll rent a bike.

       For two hours today, I had a job.    Actually, I could probably have it back if I want it, and I may.  The regional campground director agreed that I could be a campground host of sorts.  I can't be a true host because I have a tent and not a hard-sided camper, and there have been bears around (I'm not sure why campground hosts can't get eaten by bears when the paying campers can).  This means I don't really get paid, but do get to stay at my campsite for free.  Lest you think this may be a raw deal, know that they don't have cleaning tools for me there (so I don't have to do it) and the woman who runs the region will be doing the reservation-related paperwork.  So essentially I have no job responsibilities.  Also they don't really care when I'm there as long as I'm generally around on weekends.  From what I can understand, I'm getting to stay at a campsite for free.  The only catch is that the site is at almost 11,000 foot elevation, so there's not a lot of warmth, but the director said I could try it for a few days and see if it'll work for me.    So after a brief stop at Wal-Mart to look for thermal underwear, I made my way to the campground.  Even though the sky was getting darker by the minute, I thought I could get set up in time.  I reached the top of Monarch pass and turned into the campground, just as it started to precipitate.  I'm sure at a lower elevation it was raining, but at the campground, huge pieces of ice poured onto my windshield.  I watched the thermometer on my car drop below 40 and looked at the sky.  Usually in the mountains the blue sky is visible beyond the quick afternoon storm, but all I could see this time was darker sky.  The prospect of setting up camp in the hail and shivering in my Wal-Mart sweatpants sounded much less than appealing, even if it was for free.    So I drove to Crested Butte, 1 1/2 rainy hours away, to find the holy grail of hostels which unfortunately is so popular that they don't have a bed tonight, but the guy let me use the internet and pointed out some close campgrounds.  It's beautiful here, there must be some great hikes, and I saw an organic farm on the way; might see if they would like a volunteer.  And if I want a free place to stay, I know where to go.    Still trying to post those pics...now my computer's being difficult!

       It's incredibly easy to meet people hiking, camping, hostelling.  I hiked up a mountain with 3 new friends, and down it with another.  The first few nights camping I had some wonderful solitude, but have also enjoyed the company.  Last night, the teenage boy in the campsite next to me invited me over to make s'mores with his family, and then the guy camping with his sister, brother in law, and 4-month old baby brought me a plastic cup of wine and wanted to talk about hiking.  The campsite host felt very motherly towards me, according to her husband, and wanted to check in me during the night.  I had coffee with her this morning before I left, and talked about being a campsite host.    I might have a job for the next two weeks!  I'm wicked excited about it and really hope things work out.  A campsite at Monarch in CO needs a host, and the woman in charge would love to have me there for a few weeks.  The only problem:  I have a tent, not a camper, and there are bears around.  She's trying to get it approved with the highers-up and I'm hoping to hear in the next hour or two, so I can figure out what I'm doing tonight, tomorrow, next week, etc.    Hopefully I'll find a wireless internet connection soon (instead of the library computers) and post some pics because I can't possibly describe it all.  I think I combed my hair yesterday but can't quite remember when I last looked in a mirror.  I love this!

       There's a pub in Fort Collins where you can go, expecting that your friends will be there.  Start with a group of 4 and it becomes 7, 11...not because everyone's been frantically making plans via cell phone, but because that's where people go.  Walk your dog regularly enough and people will recognize you, greet you in the street, and stop to talk.  You might ask them to join you as you grab coffee.    One of the hardest adjustments for me after college was not having places to go where you could expect to see someone you knew.  In DC, an evening out requires some detailed choreography in advance if it involves more than two people.  I really like being in a place that lets you have an unscripted evening and still catch up with friends.    It was 54 and rainy here today-- I didn't build rain into the summer plans!  I'm going to a baseball game tomorrow, then plan to head into the Rocky Mountain wilderness for several days.  If there's nothing new here for awhile, you can trust that I'm happily munching gorp and wading in creeks.

       I want to be a cowgirl when I grow up.  I did when I was 6 and when I was 15, and even now the open spaces, the long times alone and moving, the idea of getting somewhere on my own make me feel just right.  I can't tell you what I think on the road-- sometimes I'm thinking about the big questions, just chipping away at what I think about life.  Sometimes I'm completely zoned out.  Sometimes I'm singing along with the music.  Sometimes I'm replaying memories.  And somehow I can't pull apart one way of thinking from the other, they alternate with such frequency.  Really, I think it's my brain's happiest state.    I drove through Illinois and Iowa Monday, then Nebraska and Colorado on Tuesday.  Covering such distance in a short amount of time really makes the landscape changes clear.  I can see mountains now!  It's what I've been craving.

       When I'm 84, I would like to enjoy life as much as Dave Brubeck seems to.  I don't normally enjoy piano jazz, but Dave Brubeck's love for the instrument shows up even in his recordings.  Live, he shuffles to the piano and bends over the keyboard until his neck is almost at right angles to his back, but his hands still move like I imagine they always have.    I went to Ravinia tonight to hear Brubeck and his quartet, who were not quite octogenarians like Brubeck himself, but all had white hair.  They all wore ties, and not one could stand still, even when he wasn't playing.     urlLink Ravinia   rivals the lakefront path as Chicago's best attraction.  You pay $10 for lawn seats on just about any night of the summer to hear anyone from Dave Brubeck to the Chicago Symphony to Rufus Wainright.  Beforehand, you'd do well to bring a picnic and lawn chairs-- and during the show people sleep, read the paper, play games, continue eating (and some actually just sit and listen to the music).    If you haven't heard Dave Brubeck and his quartet play Take Five, do it now.  There's a snippet at  urlLink Amazon.com , but it's not a waste of money to buy an entire album.

       Maybe once I leave Chicago I'll have more adventures.    Most (though certainly not all) of my time here has revolved around various family activities, and being with my family skews my idea of an adventure.  I saw an aunt yesterday who heard that I had left my job and said "I was just starting to think that you were settled and now here you go doing all sorts of other things!"  She and my uncle run the second generation of the Wunderink farm, and everyone already wonders who will take it over in the next generation.  My grandparents live on the farm with my aunt and uncle, and when we visited this weekend I climbed up to the attic to get a fresh look at where I had slept as a kid.  There were the same twin beds with the same comforters I had used, which were the same beds and comforters my dad and his brothers used as kids.    The farm has changed, even I can see it, but more slowly than the lives I see normally.  If I had stayed longer, I'd want to ask my grandparents what they thought "an adventure" was.  They raised 8 kids on a farm-- really, I imagine every day was an adventure.  In comparison, mine feels a bit artificial.    But while I mostly describe these months as an adventure, there's a second component, which I've been soaking up for the last 10 days:  making sure that I connect with my friends and family who live so far away, and whose lives are in such transition.  It was important for me to be with my family when my sister left for Kazakhstan, just as it's important to see the farm now that I'm an adult (or more of one than years ago when I was last there).  It's also important to me to connect with friends who are getting married, starting school-- or even going through more subtle changes.

       My sister never broke down or melted down, freaked out, or even teared up in the week before she left for the Peace Corps.  In fact, I haven't seen her so pulled together in a year-- she graduated in 2002 and spend a full year juggling part time jobs, hoping for 6AM phone calls asking her to substitute teach, and creating spreadsheets to figure out how to pay rent, when to take classes, etc.  Her life was up in the air in every way possible for a full year, but when she got her Peace Corps assignment, things all pulled together for her.  Not to say that all her plans solidified (the Peace Corps is notorius for its ambiguity), but the end goal was clear.    This morning it all came together-- all her underwear, boots, and business casual fit into two huge marigold LL Bean bags.  She showered, ate, did one final check through her things.  She hugged my mom and I, stood at the door and smiled a moment, then turned and walked down the hall without looking back.    My parents and I don't quite know what to do with ourselves today.  I've thought a few times "she's still on the plane,"  "OK, now she'll be in DC-- hope her bags aren't to heavy to handle" and other things.  Come Sunday night I will no longer be able to guess what she's doing-- she'll have landed in Kazakhstan and begun her adventure on the other side of the world.

       Even driving all across America I doubt I will find a radio station as kick-ass as  urlLink the Loop , Chicago's 97.9.  The Loop is the music of sweaty dark gym basements, a station whose idea of rocking is Black Sabbath, Ozzie, and Guns n Roses and who believes it is appropriate to rock all the time.  Its DJs are in it for the music, never checking around to make sure their version of rocking is up to date.  Its sets feature one-hit-wonder hair metal bands as well as the true classics.  The Loop is rock in its purest form.  Chicago deserves the Loop.

       My parents moved last December from a suburb of Memphis to downtown Chicago.  This is the first time I've stayed with them and noticed how they translated their life from one place to a completely different environment.  They sold all their Memphis furniture-- what fits well in a suburban Southern home does not in an urban apartment.  I like noticing what they kept-- the illustrated songbooks I used when first learning to play the piano and the big rocking chair we used to bash into the kitchen wall.  They were most worried that they'd miss chances to be outside (and not feel stifled by the city), but their long weekend walks are on the path along Lake Michigan, and they drink coffee and read the Sunday paper in a city park.  Now, in addition to being less fashionable than my Mom, I also have good reason to feel less urbane!

       Don't hold me to it, but here's the rough plan for my summer: driving west then back east, with stops in Ft. Collins, Denver, Salt Lake City, Eugene, Portland, Seattle, possibly Vancouver, North Cascades National Park, Simone's cabin, Kathryn's parents' farm, Missoula, Glacier National Park, North Dakota, Minneapolis, possibly Madison and Chicago and Ann Arbor/Detroit again, Niagra, then somehow making it back to DC by approximately mid-August.    I'm in Chicago right now, and will be until the end of next week, hanging out with my sister who will leave Thursday for 2 years in Kazakhstan with the Peace Corps.

       Chicago just built a  urlLink huge park  downtown near the Art Institute.&nbsp; According to the Tribune, it's "late and over budget, but nobody seems to care."&nbsp; The park features an outdoor amphitheater, gardens, huge walls of water that kids and some adults play in (ooh, I wanted to play in it), and-- my favorite--  urlLink the Bean , a kidney-bean shaped sculpture (or Tiffany neckace-shaped sculpture) that reflects the entire city.&nbsp;

       I had some great pictures to post...of a moose, my groundhog campsite, and the amazing Canadian Rockies.&nbsp; But those will have to wait until I get to Chicago (as far as I can tell there's no public wireless internet from where I am through North Dakota and Minnesota).&nbsp; But the itinerary is one more night in beautiful Montana, then to Theodore Roosevelt Nat'l Park for just a bit, a few nights in Minnesota, a few days in Chicago, a night in Michigan, then back to DC!&nbsp;   This has been an unbelievable trip and this is by no means my last post but it feels like things are winding down and I'm getting ready to go back.&nbsp; To varying degrees, I miss Rock Creek Park, my house and room, the guy in DC who's played millions of Ultimate frisbee games in the last 2 months, and everyone else I know in the city.&nbsp; My life there is by no means stable (read:&nbsp; I don't have a job!) but I do know where I'll be sleeping and where to get food and how not to get lost (mostly).&nbsp;   Anyway-- cool pictures will be up soon.&nbsp; If you're bored in the next few days-- call me!&nbsp; I'll be in the car!!&nbsp;

       The mountains here are gorgeous, but Banff is a bit overdeveloped.&nbsp; I was hiking a trail when I noticed a trail marker for hot springs.&nbsp; The thought of a good soak was nice, so I decided to take the 1.7 km trail.&nbsp; It zig zagged up and up until it reached…a huge parking lot and an even more obscenely large hotel/resort thing.&nbsp; I had made my way up one side of a mountain, the other side of which held a road and well-developed resort.&nbsp; Big sigh—no dangling my feet in woodsy hot springs for me.&nbsp; The resort wouldn’t take the $5USD I had in my bag and I’d left my Canadian money (and my swimsuit) in the car.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Later yesterday afternoon a thunderstorm rolled in.&nbsp; I hadn’t set up my tent yet and I was too dirty to go sit in town, so I headed up to a scenic lookout, pulled on my plastic pants and waterproof jacket, and sat outside to watch the storms roll through.&nbsp; I guess not having a “home” forces one into more extreme ways of passing time, but it was awesome to watch the storm move between the mountains (hopefully I’ll post a fun picture soon).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  The Canadian Rockies are an entirely different mountain range than the Rockies in the US.&nbsp; Here you can see the striations of rocks going diagonally, curving, and generally painting a pretty good picture of which tectonic plate won.&nbsp; The glaciers just sitting on top of and in between mountains are amazing as well.&nbsp; I drove through the mountains for about 5 hours today and couldn't figure out how to react to such stunning and wild beauty with the mountains and powerful creeks and glaciers except by crying.

       My tent has two poles.&nbsp; The base of the tent is rectangular and the first pole cuts the rectangle into two triangles, and the second crosses it to make four triangles like a PB&amp;J.&nbsp; When I walk around campsites I've seen the marvelous contraptions that people sleep in-- tents with 5 poles, tents that you could do cartwheels in, trailers that look like they'd make a truck tip over, trailers that pop up and out and people sleep all over.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I walk around my campsite pretty much every evening.&nbsp; It doesn't get dark up north until after 10, so there's plenty of time even if I get to a site late.&nbsp; Although the pattern varies depending on where I am, here are the several things I do pretty much every time I camp:  &nbsp;- Eat Cream of Wheat for breakfast, sometimes followed by a homemade mocha &nbsp;-&nbsp;Lay in my tent&nbsp;(either at breakfast or in the evening) and read in my underwear (this is a luxury of camping:&nbsp; lots of time to read in your longjohns) - Take a long, fast hike.&nbsp; Sometimes I head out intending to take a shorter or less fast hike and it never works.  - Eat an entire box of Mac and Cheese for dinner &nbsp; I just came up from Glacier Nat'l Park back into Canada to visit Banff and Jasper.&nbsp; I love Glacier, and highlights of this trip include: - Waking up at 4 one morning and not being able to sleep, so taking the rainfly off my tent and watching the sun rise while I daydreamed - Swimming each night before dinner in the breathtakingly cold glacial lakes - Singing breathy renditions of REM to scare off bears during a trail run

       Although I loved pretty much everything about Vancouver (except the radio), two things especially stood out.  One was the newly-opened  urlLink Storyeum , which told the story of British Columbia on the stage.  I actually didn't watch the show, but wandered the lobby for hours listening to the performers and watching them walk through the lobby, looking at old pictures, and reading the captions and quotes from people who were there. The  urlLink UBC Anthropology Museum  complemented this well.  The curators have placed entire collections out for viewing, so instead of seeing one Peruvian basket or Inuit soapstone carving you see hundreds.  There's a notebook nearby each display with notes on each-- where it was from, use, condition when obtained, and other notes.  I found it much easier to get a real feel for the area or period by seeing many objects rather than one.  They also display objects that other museums have a hard time categorizing and often just leave in storage-- trinkets made in Turkish prisons, for example.    Today I head back to Oregon to spend a week at my friend Simone's family cabin.  This place is legendary among Northwestern folks and I'm excited to spend a week jumping (and maybe sleeping?) on the trampoline, exploring Hood River, helping out where needed with the cabin, reading, running, hiking, and as my friend Brian says "laughing so hard my belly hurts."    As with most wonderful trips, time picks up momentum as it goes and seems to barrel towards the end.  On one hand, I'm not looking forward to it, but it is infinitely better to finish a trip I didn't want to end than to arrive back in DC sick of the car, sick of my tent, sick of my 3 t-shirts, and completely ready to be done.  At first I wondered how I could possibly fill 2 months and now I wonder how I could have thought I'd get enough of mountains, cities, friends in that amount of time.

        urlLink    This sums up my experience in Vancouver well, and I hope it speaks a bit to my life more generally.  It was in the lobby of the Storyeum.  &nbsp; urlLink

        urlLink    These guys were awesome.  They walked around the Storyeum playing, and I walked around listening.  A woman on stilts dressed as an eagle also walked around and every once in awhile they'd interact, with her dancing around them and them changing the song a bit to include her.&nbsp; urlLink

       This is a blog for all of you.  I know you want to talk more about music (I guess because you assume since I'm in the car all the time that I'm always listening?  You are correct.), and I've heard you want more pictures.  For #1, see pictures below.  For #2, check out  urlLink KEXP  in Seattle.  I've never heard Belle and Sebastian on the radio before, let alone in the same set as James Brown and G-love.  In fact, it's been awhile since I heard so many new band names and so much interesting music on the radio.  I was about to start a list of bands to check out, but I realized I can listen on their website and I don't lose out on all this after I leave Seattle!

       OK, it's an adjustment to be back here.  I think the major change is the feeling that I don't have complete control over who I see, where I go, or what I do.  I have to wait for companies to call me back if I want to get hired!  I can only see friends when they're not working or otherwise occupied!  I even have to schedule time to see people!  I have to sit in traffic!  I can't walk around outside in my PJ's!  (scratch that-- I did it yesterday)  If I don't like a situation for some reason, I can't just leave town.  On the other hand, I drive 15 minutes to see people, rather than 8 hours.  I've slept in the same bed for a week-- and it's a bed not a sleeping bag!  I actually run into people I know!  If I can't see DC friends this week, I can see them next week!  I can eat a variety of refridgerated and even frozen food!  I dunno.  It's an adjustment.

       ...and I can hardly believe it's been 2 months, a nearly perfect 2 months. Somewhere along the way, concepts like Time and Home lost their meaning, and the question "what do you do?" signaled the start of a somewhat philisophical conversation. When I quit my job I had the sense that the summer wasn't an abberation but the beginning of a lifestyle, and I feel that even more strongly now.  Someday I'd like to call a place-- not just a town or city, but a specific building, Home. Now, however, things like rent checks and furniture and accumulation of any sort seem distasteful in a way. I hope I have learned to hold tightly to the important things, just as I've learned to let go of the inconsequential.  Introspection aside, here's a wrapup of the trip. Miles driven: almost 10,000 (average miles per gallon: somewhere around 48, best in the mountains and worst on the flat stretches) Total trip time: 2 months, 2 days New car name: Quark New CDs acquired: approximately 30 Number of states visited that I'd be happy to live in: 7 Nights spent scared out of my mind (for ridiculous reasons): 2 New beers to recommend: Alaskan Ale, Fat Tire, Moose Drool My only regret: not having my bike Item I'd like never to see again:  my green pants Item I didn't miss a bit:  blow dryer What I'll miss:  waking up in a tent, wearing a sweater in the summer, constant time outdoors, hostel lounges, fresh roadsite/farm/orchard fruit, friends' couches and porches...on and on  By the way, I keep meaning to say this-- if I saw you on this trip and didn't write about it on the blog, don't be offended! You'll notice I didn't really write about anybody. Half the people reading this know you and half don't have a clue who you are. We had a fantastic time, but it's hard to describe it for an audience. Thanks for your hospitality and for spending time with me-- seeing friends really made the trip.  I'm not sure what'll happen to my blogging habit now. I will probably continue to mull over the trip online, but don't feel the need to subject yourself.  You all are wonderful for keeping up with me!  Like I said, friends made the trip-- in person, over the phone, or email.
