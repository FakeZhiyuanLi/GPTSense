      I have to pee rely bad but ill egnor it a little bit longer. Well I called Micheal today after about a week and I dont think that he will ever call me back or wish to continue to be freinds. When I spoke to him he kinda blew me of and spoke as if I was bugging him, so I dont know what now. I realy cared for him as a very good freind, I feel ive been turned down on who I am, was I a bad freind? Oh well if he dousn't want to be my freind I don't want to be his I have better people to talk to that like me for who I am. I fell inatiquit however right now, I started this online journal to post my ideas and thought for everyone to see but, I have been troubled with personal afairs to much. Tomarow I have much to say and it will stimulat your mind on meny difrent levels. ICA

      I've met so meny interesting people within the past couple months and not all but most have problems of a dangerous sort. I dont undestand how I meet them what makes them take interest in me and why they leave so quickly but shit happens. I've been busy with (what a kowinkidink) people. I divide up my time but never have enouf to do everything I want, and I have been having problems with my realy imporant freind. When andrew gets back I need to get painting for my showing with him, but then what about mickeal and sarah and the two allys and coleen and colon and tianna and electra and emonia with chelse and how I owe them a smoke out and then I wanted to hang with Diana some if I could and the big problem is none of them know eachother pluse I need to get a job so I can do stuff when I hang out with people but then ill have less time to hang out with them all and knock on wood that this be a problem i love it I fell speacial and its not much of a burdon i've just been thinking about it being so busy this week. Watch after this week ill have no one to hang out with their all leave. I also have been worried about micheal and the whole nickol thing, he seems realy depressed and I wish there was something I could do but he dousnt talk that much enymore and I dont know what to say. I dont think were going to stop being freinds, not on his life I just wish he would talk to me more about whats wrong and open up some more. Then theres sarah shes realy stressed and has money problems and I love her so much, I wish their was something I could do......o well, ill think of something. TTFN ICA

      I have some ideas, I want to begin makeing some short flicks for fun but the ideas I have are a little bit segestive, but what the fuck am I saying eveythings segestive. I want to record my 87 year old Nana, not to make fun of her but I want to film her doing her everyday things but...( When ever I see my Nana I have have ths constant felling she will kill over eny minut, and it scares the shit out of me. I had an incident whare I was in the liveing room and I turn my head just in time to see something fall. I thought it was my Nana, I thought she finally died. I stood still for about 5 minuts before I had to look she didnt fall a bag of dog food fell she was in her room doing god knows what but it was scary)...There are meny incidents whare you thing she just died but every time we discover someway or another she dousnt. Then whan you think the movie is about over and shell be fine we see a quick shot of her dead on the floor. Ill expand on it a bit more but thats the jif of it in a nut shell. Then I also had a funny one whare you see a bunch of homeless familys and starving children and play the music "you cant always get what you want" or some other silly music. Wel that one might be a bit stupid but I like the fist one. I ts been a stressful day it being the twenty second and andrew flying Europ. I told him not to travel on my unlucky day, ill croos my fingers untill I see him again besides that its been a weird day.               ICA

      The meaning of life is the same reason why a cherry tree grows cherrys and not seeds. Reproduction is the key to life, and with that a thought crosses my mind that I dont need to be a good artist to be great and famous I just need to make my shit as I want, just alot of it. Ill typ mor later TTFN ICA

      alright today was fathers day, as we all hopefully know and i say was because as soon as you hand your  beloved  father that card and he reads it and gives you that hug no more descusion thats it even if he wants to celebrate its nothing but the after efects so with that lets carry on. I was sadly disapointed last thursday when I saw the movie saved. It began so wonderfly with the main character(Mary) being shoked with her boyfreind telling her he was gay. With that she receives a sign from Gawd, wich happens to be Gawd himself swimming twards her in her swimming pool. She belives that the only way to   fix    her boyfreind is to have sex with him, and who would have guessed it she becomes pregnent. It was hillarious from the begining up until about the middle, the movie had my attention it had its grasp on me with its cristianity bashing and such but then at the end they reach a point of them truly understanding what Gawd wants of them and how he will always love you ect, so with that I most likly wont see it again or at least not all the way thrue. A quote from the sacramento Bee "The result is a film that looks like a comedy, and feels like a comedy, but isnt isn't funny in ways you expect a contemporary social comedy to be, particularly one that has the guts to be a satire on religious hypocrisy. A prime example of a missed opportunity". Now I dont usualy agree with the papper but with this i shake my head in agreement.   littlestcat.com, go to this then click on   i ching   and discover the fun in ancient chinease fortuntelling. Besides that my week has been ok, Micheal hasnt called me in a while so im kinda down on that. Plus im in despret need of a job so with that.     farethewell..        ICA PS.I cant spell

      you know what bloggie..I have a secret to tell you and since no one reads you enyway, and im aparently not going to spew my intelectual thoughts like I thought I would im gonna tell you. Andrew recently broke up with his girl freind and its terrible I feel simpathy for him I know how it feel but now hes checking out older men and im not comforetable with that, it seems dangerous. I know that sounds stupid but I worrie and I dont like it at all. Then hes saying he dousnt want to go out with enyone but he wants to date well im not saying I want a relationship or enything but I wouldnt mind going on a date or something, sounds like fun. Then also Micheal has been realy mean by egnoring me, well maybe not egnoring but blowing me of and I told him some pritty personal stuff and he was a good freind but I think he is going, going, and now well...gone. But what can you do? I have been enjoying myself thuroly however more than usual, I have been pausing more often and niticing the things around me more intensely so thats nice, my head feels clear and I have been reading more and being more progressive insted of just drinking and smoking the reefer, I think ill stop that. I have much more to say but I rented a realy great movie called Elizabeth and I must wach it.  Farewell ICA

      alot has happend in the past two days you as the reader can only imagine...........the dull experiences im thinking about. I want to go out and do someting tomarow see a band or hang..I think ill do that, in the mean time ill take a bath. I need to talk to alot of people before we loos contact and the best way to do that is to procrastonate. I cut my dearly loved bangs of tomarrow, and I want to see a movie very badly all of a sudden.
