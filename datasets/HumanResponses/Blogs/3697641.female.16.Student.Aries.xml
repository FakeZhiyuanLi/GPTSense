      And the end is the beginning.   Whoever thought things would have worked out this way?     It turns out I have no control whatsoever over my heart.  But I feel now.  After all this wanting, I might have found something worth singing for.  Wouldn't that be lovely...  I want to write pretty words.  I want to look back on them tomorrow and days to come and think, "wow, that's beautiful."  but there's nothing beautiful about right now.  and that's why i love it.  it's raw and passionate and spontaneous and i never know what's going to happen next.   and he knows what he wants.  it's not my best friend and it's not some girl i've never met but secretly wish would asphyxiate.  No.    This time, it's  ME.   it's incredible, to be wanted.  it's what i've been searching for all along and it was right under my nose.  isn't that the cliche of the century...  every teen romance movie with a mediocre plot supported by good looking actors is proof enough of that...  but i don't care.  this is perfect, this here and now.  this is you and me and this is what I want.  i just don't know...  if this is all we were meant to be?  we could make so much more.  but it's all up to you.  we will see, in time.  we will see.   "I'm broken, when I'm lonesome... I don't feel right when you're gone..."

      I did it.  I cut you loose.  I didn't imagine it would be this way, though.  It wasn't intentional.  Turns out all I had to do was open up and let the truth out. I finally discovered what I want.   and i want so much.  but today, i don't want you.    I love this feeling.  The one that comes when your heart is empty.  There's no tingling, no aching, no  anything.     Right now there's just a calm and peaceful sort of nothing that's settling around me like dust and cobwebs.    It's good to be me again.   (me, and not you.)   I don't know why I felt the need to lie.  To myself, to my friends.  I guess it just seemed the best way to hide.  It always does...  But I don't have to hide anymore; the monster's out of the closet.  And he's not as scary as I imagined.    Everything is lighter.  This is a good place to be.  Here and now...  Here's hoping I never leave.      "I wanted you to know, I love the way you laugh."   [thisistheend.]

      It's about time I woke up.  I've been dreaming far too much.  About life.  About you.  And it's driving me insane.  I'm starting to think I don't know what I'm thinking anymore.  I snapped today.  Everything broke apart and I let go.  It felt so good, and so bad I want to be sick.  I don't know what I'm doing.   is this the diary of a crazy woman?    I wish it would just end.  Everything.  All the wanting...  God, the wanting.  It shouldn't be like this.  I shouldn't feel this way.  How can you make me feel like this?  I don't know.  It's a crazy state of being.  I don't understand.  And you won't give me a chance.    So good bye.  Tomorrow is the day I turn everything right side up.  I'm shaking you loose.  If I can...   "I'm everything you want I'm everything you need I'm everything inside of you that you wish you could be I say all the right things at exactly the right time but I mean nothing to you and I don't know  w  h  y"

      hi.  I really thought things couldn't get worse.  But you know, as soon as you admit that, you're setting yourself up.  So I guess this is all my fault.     I just wanted something real...   Wanting is human nature.  It's primal.  We all want.    I want to dance.  I want to go crazy.  I want to  feel.   And I want you.  I'm singing for you, love, even though you can't hear me.  This day makes me realize how quickly things change.  A few words can send everything spiralling...     out of control   I want it to end.  [again it comes down to wanting.]  I want a new beginning and a reason to smile.  And I guess you'll find me when you want to...  Let's just hope you don't get lost too.   "I'm you and me, and a whole lot more and I'm here and I'm near. I can see you but you won't see me and there's a reason for this song... It's cuz everything I thought about love everything I thought about love everything I thought about love is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong..."

      So.  Here I am again.  Capitalizing and punctuating, trying to create some semblance of order in my life.    (There is none.)  Have you ever noticed that the more you want something, the more unavailable it becomes?  And that what you don't want is so tangible you just want to strangle it and make it go away...  Okay, so that was (a little) over the top.  But I feel so...  so... I can't explain.   Surrounded, confounded, emotionally dumbfounded...   Right now I want so many things at once and I can't identify anything.  Everything is bleeding together.   undefined   kind of like me.  I don't even know who I am anymore.  I never would have imagined myself this way...  And yet somehow I'm strangely comfortable in this skin.    *Ranting...*  I don't know what else to say.  I feel like I could write for hours on empty words and meaningless cliches.  But once I start I know I won't be able to stop.  to the one i'm singing for: "you drained my heart...and made a spade."

         Can't find...just can't find...     I'm searching but I don't even know what I'm looking for.  Love/lust/passion/hope...  I don't know.  I do know that I feel so incomplete; I'm in pieces all over the floor and no one can pick me up and reassemble me.    Cliche and depressing.    That's life.   Nothing less, and nothing more...

      hot off the press.  first one in a long while.    the how-to of butterfly dissection.     i am exposed.   (on the edge of reality and dreaming, fragile and wanton)   and (you'll find) my colours aren't brilliant  and my wings are easily torn. but the good thing about paper is that it can be taped back together  multiple times and it's the little indiscretions like these that make us grateful for  scotch tape  and staples.   but you, no, you were never one for patchwork. too revealing, you said as i stripped away my skin and you watched. i danced and we gave birth to sin in your arms.   and i was never one for paper planes, but you persisted, and so i let you fold me up and slip me into  your back pocket  for later dates and rainy days. [i think the concept of flight eluded you, as you steamrolled my hopes and left bits of denim imprinted on my skin] but it's alright. i didn't have anywhere else to be, anyway.   (and it's in times like these that i can't seem to get enough of scotch tape.)   i am cheap and see-through.   [exposed]

       why? why? why?    i don't know.  i just  don't.   i used to know.  i used to know a lot of things.  what i wanted, who i was, how i felt...    where, where did it go?    i can't seem to find what i'm looking for.  though i suppose it would help if i actually knew what it is that i need/want.  i always hated those who had no direction.  aimless and wandering...  that's no way to live.  but i find myself admiring them now.  how do they do it?  all i want to do is die, but they seem so content to just...float.  on the edge of reality and dreaming, fragile and exposed...    butterfly:     floating/fragile/dreaming/reality/wandering...   i am exposed.  but my colours aren't brilliant and my wings are easily torn.    i am not strong.  i can hide behind a straight face and dry eyes but i am scared.  scared of the future.  scared of you.  scared of me.  what's to become of us..  i've never been so vulnerable.  it's all so surreal.  pinch me, am i still breathing?   (pinch me. am i still breathing?)    if i don't find a way out... i might suffocate.  so.  tell me, tell me you know where i'm supposed to be.  it can't be here.  [can't be.]  and if it is...is it really worth it?  of course i'm not talking about the end.   the end is the beginning.   i'm talking about that new beginning.  that reason to smile. if i can't find it here...  maybe i've been in the wrong place all along.   but who knows.  i certainly don't.   "hoping is out of style, so look happy.  it's the end of the world."
