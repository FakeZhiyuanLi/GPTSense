						   I am currently reading a book called "Prayer Walking" The concept is to strengthen you body as well as your soul. Hmmm...I think I am going to give this book a try. I do need to prayer more and get a stronger prayer life, and I do need to lose some weight. But in order to do this, I will have to get up early and actually get out there and walk. I think, once I am done with the book, I will actually get started. I will have to let you know how it goes.  Church yesterday was awesome! We had a powerful move of God and a total refreshing swept through the church. It was amazing! During last nights service, I got all the girls in the youth group up at the front dancing and jumping. It was such a great time in the Lord. Those girls are so special and God is doing great things in their lives.

						   Well, I am starting a blog for the first time. I guess I will share a little about myself.   I am 27 years old. Married 3 years (August 18) to a wonderful man of God. He is a minister with the ALJC and we are the youth pastors at our church.  Currently I work for an Insurance company. I am the Marketing Assistant. I love where I work. The people are great!  My husband is starting his own interior business ding remodeling and painting.

						   I am learning to listen to God's voice. Sometimes he speaks in a voice so small, I have to stop what I am doing just to listen. Like this morning, I had this feeling to pray for my husband. I had to stop what I was doing and pray. I prayed until the feeling left. I don't know if he was in danger or not, but God lead me to pray for him right then and there. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I no longer listened to His voice. I don't think I am going to take that chance to find out.  I watched Jurassic Park 3 last night. I know, I am one of those people that actually like the movies. I really enjoyed number 3. It was a little different from the others. More action packed. My husband called me in the middle of it and told me I should be studying my insurance books instead of watching a movie. Well, he is right, but I finished the movie anyway.   My husband is working out of town this week.
