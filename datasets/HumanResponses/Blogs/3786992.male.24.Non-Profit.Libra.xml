      ChildHood Memory, a song from Bandari, was recorded in album 日光海岸. It's the best one in this album indeed, better than 'A Woodland Night'. I thought. I don't know how to describe the melody, but it's beautiful. It makes my brain as cooool...

      Centos - a distribution linux based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux which was found hardly (exactly about 2 weeks ago). Im luckly it's free. People like free software, me 2, especial the Linux OS. certainly. I trust her. Her is able to works finely (close to PERFECT i hope). The only BAD thing is that it's failed first when i was experimenting Oralce RAC on it. Installation can't be continue and finally has been putted onto other side (i dont' have more time to do this):) I was trying to get greatly remedy for resolving that as well. uselessful!! I need help then indeed.

      Few weeks ago, i found that Google announced its fresh email service, called Gmail (i like the name), which will provide approximately 1G storage (probably with high value) for every user around the world. Indeed? Looks like so COOL. Can i to get it directly? Is it free? I'll store for my more and more musics. hahahaah. I need it i thought. My favor music can be accessed easier even left apartment. :) Unluckily, i don't have with it so far. I postted my email addresses to try to register for getting gmail again and again. And then nothing will be happened. I got nothing from Google. Just to wait for her's response, until now. Where's my ggggmail??

      The oracle world had been pasted 4 days, at international convention center in shanghai. It was&nbsp;first time that i was so closed to the Big conference. But the ticket was so expensive to me, finally i was absent. It was&nbsp;regrettable i thought. indeed. I thought that there were many oracle experts would be present in conference from all of the world. At least the official experts and personages.&nbsp; If i was in meeting, i would hope to see Tom ( urlLink http://asktom.oracle.com ) &nbsp;personally in there. hahah. That was wonderful.&nbsp;Didn't you?&nbsp; So, i'd like to join for next time in sh. Just go ahead..

      i will attemp to do an examination in future days, for Oracle Certified Professional(OCP). Im thinking that it's easy for me.. I really do. But i want to review the classes for sure. There isn't panic to face examination. In truth, i don't like to do that. I mean the ocp. however, there is something you have to do. even if you don't like it. So, bless me.&nbsp; to pass the ocp.

      Recently days listens of melody from Celtic brought to mind my youthhood. The youth with my another good friend. We go to school together, play together too. He likes to play chinese-chess with his father. But sometimes he plays with me due to his father doesn't had much more time. In those period, i's interested in playing chinese-chess so much. And i was like to play it with him in mostly time. I don't think his technic was better than me. hahahahah. Around on 15 years-old, he was emigrated with his family to Spain, Europe. A brand-new of life, a brand-new of begining. I was contacted with him rarely by far. He told me that he was busy on his job. I guess he likes his work. hehehe. Wish he lives better in other side of the world.. The best wishes to you guy, my best friend...

      I don't like to throw my own stuff frequently, even it's useless at all. But think back to that, the 100 yuan was worthful over than just the money, at least it's truth for me by far. The morning with a storm accompanied by rain.........

      T-Mac who is the best scorer of in recently two-reg-seasons, was traded by Magic and join Rockets. At the same time, the Magic got guards SF (Steve Franics), Mobley and forward Cato in return. Magic's players Howard and other 2 guys were traded as well (swapped to Rockets). T-Mac(just 25-years old) hopes to find kind of post-season success in Houston and got the NBA champion by playing with Ming finally. "This is, by far, probably the best time that i'v experience in my career," said by McGrady after joined Houston... Welcome to Houston, welcome to combine with Yao Ming. The great combination has been created.
