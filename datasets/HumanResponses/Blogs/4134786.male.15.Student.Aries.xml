      I am not a great fan of sport. Neither is my family. But somehow my dad is watching the table tennis match for bronze, starring Li Jiawei. Heh - can hear screams emanating from the tv.  Actually it's pretty sad... the North Korean player screaming like a fruitcake must be pretty tiring, like Gerald Tay going "twit..."  Do international sport competitions encourage hatred of foreigners?

      Right. I must remember that this blog's called  Not Past Tense  for a reason.  Well, we had a funky YO rehearsal today. Beethoven's 8th is a delightfully corny piece. Not corny as in makes you look completely asinine, but corny as in childish, Mozart, tick-tock kind of corny. The 2nd movement is ridiculous. Written in 2/4 but performed like 4/2. Heh and did I mention I got to choose a new(-er) piece of firewood today? Yeah - I'm taking bass no. 3 from now on. And another thing: I was the only bassist there. Whee. It's kind of irritating when conductors rub it in, saying "More bass, please".  Oh yes. Went to Marks &amp; Spencer and bought a bag of fruit sherbets, some chocolate and 2 packs of shortbread. I am obese! (177 cm, 60 kg - that was yesterday).  Lysistrata. Funky... Ciresias (is that how you spell it) was darned funny. Sex-crazed maniacs lol.  Chamber music rules the world! (especially Poulenc, his violin sonata rocks)

      awful, awful rehearsal for OTC concert... i hate musicians wrestle everywhere and i'm starting to despise all modern music. what's the deal with counting? it's simply perverse, switching metres from 6/8 to 4/4 to 4+3/8 to 3/4 to 3/8 to 2/4 to 2+3/8 in the space of 20 bars. counting rests is what gets me. and then people will walk up to you in the middle of the piece when you're busy counting in semiquavers and quaver triplets and ask "is it fun?" perhaps it wouldn't be so difficult if i was on the bass, but on the piano you have to read 2 lines, and watch the conductor, and make sure your fingers land on the right keys... i will never EVER agree to be a chamber pianist.  what do people find in modern music? gosh, the agony. completely atonal. no melody. no sense of key. it's all about pulsating rhythm. and that's disgusting. you might as well bang trash cans like oscar in sesame street.

      Oh yeah... it's just a test. So Mr Lim (is it Lim?) said we could chat as long as we didn't talk about the test itself. lol so for one hour, we talked cock. I finished the test in about 1/2 an hour... wrote crap for the long-answer-question-thingies.  MEP quote of the century: "That's a blue rhino"

      Went over to zhaohan's house. Rehearsal for  Ricochet . No one was there yet so we boliaoed around in the "music room".  Earlier i gave him a present (2 cds) for doing acc. Being the pro he is, he thought they were  chocolates  and shoved them into the fridge. I didn't know cos I was on the piano. He wouldn't have known if I didn't ask him to play the cds.  "Those were cds? I thought they were a box of chocolates."  Anyway, he got the entire  Candide  by Bernstein (the musical, not just the overture), and Elgar's 2 symphonies + the  Cockaigne  Overture - in London town - and  Sospiri  (Sighs). Nice large round pralines with small holes in them. And embedded pits and bumps too!  lol later we boliaoed around with the Coke. Laughed and almost blew it. Really boliao afternoon.

      Exam today... scary. Quite nervous in the morning, then read  Candide  and calmed down a bit. Got to United Square by 2:20 or so... was trying not to collapse into a pile of nerves. Tuned up outside Mandelville like the way we had to last year, then this guy came and showed me into a studio. Phew. Did last minute practising... the room was rather (acoustically) wet and sounded good (cos the echoes create a full sound). Went in at about 2:50 (10 minutes ahead of schedule).   Woah... there were 2 people in the room! Gosh... panicked for a split second then I remembered the These Music Exams thing... basically one guy assesses you and the other one assesses the assessor.  I did all i could to enjoy Keyper. If you're nervous you should try enjoying your piece. Indulge in it. Bathe in the sound. Do like a soloist. So it sounded pretty decent. Ridout was *phew* pretty good too except for one or two late entries cos i was enjoying it too much (lol). Then Zhaohan left and i did Britten's YPGO and Verdi's Otello, both of which were quite good. Heh I think I wasn't tense at all. Sort of enjoy performing.  Scales. Ouch... (lol) When he asked for E major separate bows i thought "this guy's easy" but he went on to Bb minor harmonic 1 octave per bow (ouch!).  5 scales, 2 chromatics (E pizz. and Bb slurred i think) one arpeggio (oh this was a toughie: C major pizz. I overshot the top C heh), one dominant 7th, one diminished.  Breezed through sight reading... since i'm so used to doing it during orchestra/ensemble heh. No slips! But i suppose i could have done more for dynamics. Aural was great. Except (lol) i told the examiner that "This piece is contemporary, probably French". He almost laughed... asked me why I thought French. "Sounds like satie and poulenc".

      What is wrong with RISE? It's extremely difficult to tell. I keep getting this feeling that RISE is headed for some really bad place. And I think I've thought it through.  Apathy. A heck care attitude. That's probably the biggest problem. People just don't care.  Before i continue, I reiterate: This comment is entirely  personal  and should not be taken to have the  slightest official implications .  Late for rehearsal? Never mind, I've got an excuse, I can just stroll in loudly, complain that there isn't a stand/part/chair, let the door bang shut, interrupt the rehearsal for something about as important as peanuts.  Wrong entry? Who cares? I can go on entering late/out of tune/on the wrong note cos there are another 10 people playing the right thing. Or an approximation. Besides the 1sts/2nds/violas/cellos/basses are screwing up so badly that mr sze won't notice me.  Violin needs repair? Soundpost dropped? Perhaps the cello needs tuning in the middle of the rehearsal? I don't really give a damn. Since I can't project, mr sze can't hear my mistakes. Even better. I can't tune in the middle of the rehearsal, so I'll just stone there.  I can't stand these attitudes. They suggest that anyone who cares can just **** off and stick his head into the nearest dustbin. Worst of all, some people with these attitudes laugh at people who don't. Who care. And that's really discouraging.  Ok let me admit this. When it comes to doing stuff for my house (moor), I always happen to have a rehearsal for some obscure concert happening 2 weeks from now. But it is against my principles to actively  discourage  people from participating. From bothering. I usually make it a point to smile sheepishly and highlight my general apathy towards the house  vs.  the other's enthu-ness. And  that  makes people care about their house.  Perhaps I've been too nice on previous occasions. Perhaps some people read my comments and think "aha I agree but I bet he's not referring to me". You know, sometimes I might be? So here's the list.  Some violists (especially Nicholas): notable for late entries. "quite gone" is zhaohan's assessment of Nicholas. In my view you don't care about being among the worst violists the world has ever seen. Nicholas I believe you've been caught not watching/entering by mr sze many times before. But do you listen?  no . Do you care?  unlikely .  zenn  please  work at it. Life isn't a bed of roses.  Violinists might do well to improve their  attitude . Shawn, maybe you're not as stuck-up as Junhong (yes Junhong you can be pretty pissing at times even though you are extremely pro), watch it. Being pro doesn't entitle you to arrogance. Look at Adriel.  Back desk second violinists should wake up. Really if you don't give a fig about making music then I suggest you go and join a uniform group. RISE is really undermined through the efforts of people like some of you. If my comment on you is outdated and you really feel you've improved, show it.  Cellists. Most of you don't give a fig either, and would rather be flying kites at Marina. Edmund and Matthew - you are neither competent nor do you contribute much. If you really want to be a contributing member of RISE you should wake up and start paying attention to lessons with your teachers, and during rehearsals. Same applies for some sec 3s. Sec 2s are generally fine, but could be better. Jonathan Muk I have no idea what you're trying to do. I have no doubts about your ability to lead the ensemble, but  musically  speaking you have much  unrealised  potential, which doesn't mean anything.  Bassists are  painful .  When I started, we had 'sectionals' from Jan to Feb '02. Basically what I had to do was to learn the bass on my own, since mr sze only had the time to give me about 3 lessons (no more than that) and qing xiang didn't know his stuff that well either (sorry qx, but that's the whole truth). I went for  thirteen  lessons  paying  the full price for  every one of them. And I bought my bass in  April . During rehearsals since I "couldn't play" I sat around feeling neglected. This was pretty much the situation until perhaps May. Perhaps very few people remember that. That I was sitting in the back of the LAR with the air-con not working, with the weird new smells of sweat-soaked cellos and totally new people, in a completely new school, all the adjustments, everything.  You guys have it easy. No instrument, who cares? School pays for your lessons, which don't achieve anything anyway. Kuangnan and Yuze, since you don't practise between lessons, you're always back at square one at the next lesson.  Bassists are almost  expected  to be substandard. This is WRONG. Totally, heinously wrong. It's far better to aim high and miss rather than to aim low and hit. Get an instrument. A teacher. Some lessons. Go and audition for TO. Take exams. Be disciplined about your practice. Either love your instrument passionately, or hate it equally passionately (i hate it). Know it as well as you know your maths or science. Find pieces you like, and play them. Above all, "practise and improve" is what casteels told me in my YO audition. That applies to everyone.  I have this feeling that no one will bother about reading this anyway. Or think about it. I just felt I had to let go. These are observations I've gathered in rehearsals past. Problems like these will only become more acute in coming rehearsals. Musicians need to have discipline. Zeal. Passion. Fire. Artistic talent. Pride in their craft (NOT arrogance). and skill. Respect. Sensitivity.

      Rehearsal for the Ong Teng Cheong concert, sept 11. Terrible, terrible. When i got into the music studio after Mr Lee finished with TO i sat down and started reading Chaucer's  Canterbury Tales . Then Leonard (i think that's the YMS guy's name) asked whether i was the pianist for  Musicians Wrestle Everywhere  (from now on it's called the  cursed thing ). jawdrop (a lot of people started laughing). mumbled some gibberish.  Well they started with some serenade. Weird piece. Some strings, cor anglais, bassoon and horn. oh yes and harp. Lots of cor anglais solo (but we didn't have a cor anglais today). i wasn't involved, so i was reading canterbury tales (heh i've finished the tale of the Wife of Bath and the Man of Law)  while they rehearsed. heh even boring things suddenly become exciting when you listen to some music.  Then the  cursed thing .       was horrible. duple against triple rhythms. syncopation. doubling flute and cello. chords all over the place. RH 5 octaves apart from LH. Read through once - i didn't catch most of it. Rhythm is disgusting, impossible to keep counting.  cursed thing  lasted forever.  then more canterbury tales. heh was  much  more interesting than  Open Strings . I am starting to love the canterbury tales. pity i don't have the middle english edition side by side with the modern translation. hmph tango was fine. except the standard bits. the weird rhythm against rhythm section drives me nuts. and the 3/8 is killing. otherwise it was almost there.  hrmph i hate chamber music with piano. now i understand why ike doesn't want to play for trout.

      ohhhh National Day Celebrations in school. The most embarrassing thing was the songs. I mean National Day is a good idea, the parade is usually fantastic, it's just that the songs are really really corny. And the way the choir people sang it... it was really awful. they're probably sec 1s. oh and the whole thing was centred on a total lack of plot or structure. bored out of my skull.  lol i found a singapore wiki.  urlLink http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page . quite sad. about 20 articles i think, on bus services and parking rates. should get more real articles but i think very few people would be bothered to write for it.

      gosh i totally missed anders hillborg's 'Exquisite Corpse' cos of technical difficulties with the streaming audio. pissed. anyway i'm currently recording the first movement of sibelius' violin concerto.    It may be significant that the time immediately before and during Sibelius’s work on the Violin Concerto was marked by one of his worst periods of alcoholism. His heroically patient wife Aino frequently went out to search Helsinki’s fashionable clubs, bars and restaurants for him, hoping against hope that he might just sober up enough to complete the work.  The slow movement of the Concerto was apparently sketched out during a colossal three-day hangover.  Sibelius’s brother, Christian (a clinical psychiatrist), begged him to stop drinking. But Sibelius replied that he was just too weak. ‘When I am standing in front of a grand orchestra and have drunk a half-bottle of champagne, then I conduct like a young god. Otherwise I am nervous and tremble, feel unsure of myself, and then everything is lost. The same is true of my visits to the bank manager.’  - http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/aboutmusic/sibelius_violinconcerto.shtml  NO WHY DID THE AUDIENCE CLAP AFTER THE FIRST MOVEMENT?! in case you didn't know - and you probably didn't, i know my audience XD - most classical music is made up of sections called  movements  and between them you're not supposed to clap even if the orchestra stops. one of the reasons is to allow other audience members to listen to the piece as a holistic experience - without interruption.  generally the only thing that happens within a break between movements is coughing. loud hacking coughs heard from all members of the orchestra and the audience.  well anyway the bbc radio quality today is disgusting. probably my connection's fault. doesn't help that i'm blogging and reading all i can about sibelius' violin concerto. cos it's really a brilliant piece. but i think i'll use my borders voucher to get a recording of this, of some bass concerti, of bach's b minor mass (dunno why really) and one or two books.  post comments please. i can't decide which books to get. or which cds for that matter.

      boliao English Feste today... lost a game of Scrabble, walked around the school for a 'treasure hunt', didn't listen to Mr Koh's talk on science fiction (not that the talk was boring, just that science fiction isn't close to being my favourite genre) and didn't say anything for debate. oh yes, and i played scrabble during lunch again, and got totally trashed by zy and (a)drain. helped Ms Kuang clear up the stuff  black adder is a funkily odd show. zy slept through it. it was fascinatingly dumb, to me at least. and lots of humour. anyway... felt quite good after watching it.  heh that rounds up english feste. i have also noticed that i have a habit of not using capitals.

      hmm... we got to CCAB at 5:36 cos zhaohan was rehearsing his piece. turned out ok, but i think it sounds better on sibelius. we stopped at about 6:45 and slacked around. in fact we slacked around till about 7:30 cos Mr Casteels and the board came down to the music studio. yay i got the 3rd prize for the composition contest. my mom wants my tangs vouchers. but i'm keeping $20 from the marks &amp; spencer stack to get sherbert lemons, lemon gummies and potato chips. heh  and that's where the trouble started.  cos we were supposed to read the concerti. the tchaikovsky *vomits* and the beethoven. but the soloists weren't present. and Mr Casteels said that it made no sense reading a concerto without a soloist. so we stoned around for about 20 mins until he got Haydn's 'Military' Symphony out. heh at about 8:15 after we finished the second movement he stopped and said, "i have an idea". basically he got pple up to conduct. Ike, Beverly and someone else from the viola section. how fun.
