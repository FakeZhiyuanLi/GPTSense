      We went strawberry picking yesterday at this farm called Rae's near Brittania and Trafalgar. It was a different experience...first it's an organic farm (no pesticides!) so there were a lot of weeds growing everywhere around the strawberry plants. I think I'm used to the neat little rows most farms grow their produce in. Second, there was a really mean old lady! She yelled at Vivian and Alex right at the beginning because according to her, they weren't supposed to be in the area -- we were supposed to stay in the area we were assigned to. What kind of stupidness is that? If there aren't any strawberries in one area we move on to the next until we find some! I didn't even know we were "assigned" an area. Both Vivian and Alex were quite annoyed (well, pissed actually) with her.   I got yelled at too. I sort of wandered off on my own and then when I tried to go back to where everyone else was, that stupid lady asked me (in a not very nice manner) where I was going. Hello it's just a strawberry patch! I think she was senile.    urlLink    me in an overgrown strawberry field

      I can't believe it but I've started to watch anime on YTV again! Every Friday night at 10 pm I'm like, omg I have to watch Inu-Yasha!! haha I'm so weird. But it's my brother's fault! He never stopped watching cartoons on tv and I don't think he'll ever stop. The show is done in the style of Sailor Moon...with the big eyes and the long legs. I'm not sure what the style is called officially. So this totally reminds me of when I used to watch Sailor Moon when I was in high school. It used to be on at 12 noon everyday (I can't believe I still remember that) and I still have the Sailor Moon stickers and a poster somewhere. I have a Sailor Moon sticker on my flute case too!! hehe. I never play my flute anymore...and my dad bugs me about it sometimes. But that's another story. That goes along with the piano that sits in the living room that never gets played :p  So from Sailor Moon I got hooked on Dragon Ball. Then it was Macross Plus (which I still really like). Then a bunch of anime films I don't remember the names to. Oh yeah and Pokemon and Digimon!! HAHAHA...I actually have a HUGE pikachu plush toy that doubles as a pillow that Vivian gave me. Escaflowne is one of my favourites too. haha good times, good times...

      Things are so different at York now! First there are the nice signs they have for the buildings and also for the street names. New buildings everywhere (the Technology and Enhanced Learning Building is so cool and there's Tim Hortons and other food in there! Right behind CFA!! I'm always happy when the food is closer...)  And they used a super big tent for convocation this year. It was fun! Young and I went uninvited to the convo because ADAM didn't invite us... :p Teresa was supposed to convocate too but she couldn't get off work (flaky Teresa!). The grads started coming in the tent and we didn't see Adam...we thought, "omg what if Adam didn't come??" haha but he was there and it wasn't actually too boring. Jazz great Dave Brubeck performed 2 numbers with his son -- it was really good. I didn't even know who he was but apparently he's pretty famous :D   The food after wasn't as good as last year though! We had fruit, cake, different little desserts and cookies. This year there was only cake and cupcakes. Oh, and sandwiches with cream cheese and cucumber and others with tuna. The sandwiches were pretty good. But the big thing is...THERE ARE NO MORE SAMOSA HATS!! What the... Maybe people complained about them too much so they decided not to use them anymore. But they were fun. It's part of the York experience!    "If you can hold a fork, you can go to York!"    urlLink    urlLink    urlLink    1. where are the samosa hats? 2. young and adam: pimpin' 3. uh oh...grafitti on the nice signs already??

      I got a pineapple! Well, I got it last week from Garvey for convocation. There's a funny story behind it actually...he was going to get me flowers or a plant but I told him last time that he gave me too many so then he saw the pineapple and thought, "oh this is almost the same" so he picked it up and bought it. He can probably tell you a better story since my stories tend to ramble and people never know when they end. It's sort of like this story I'm telling.... haha  In the pic I look kind of dopey and Garvey looks like he just woke up (he's been busy with school...stuck in the comp animation lab rigging his characters with I-K switches and other stuff I don't understand...). Oh, and we're in a Japanese restaurant with my family.  The pineapple was really good! yum...   urlLink    garvey, me and a pineapple

      Yes, I went to lunch at Mandarin! haha...it wasn't too bad -- it was only $8.99! I went with Garvey and his animation friends and I made Garvey eat a sweet and sour chicken ball. I have a thing against chicken balls. When I was young, one of my family friend's uncles owned a Chinese fast food place and we hung out there sometimes and helped out with folding boxes etc. We played games and the loser would get the ultimate punishment: they had to eat a CHICKEN BALL. Ok, so it's not the ultimate punishment but chicken balls are so absurd. It's this little piece of chicken surrounded by tons of batter. So really you're getting a mouthful of batter. And it's not real Chinese food!  (I just realized I advertised for Mandarin. :s )  Anyway, for dessert I got different flavours of ice cream in one bowl with M&M sprinkles. I put it down on the table and went out to get some cake and fruit. When I came back, half of my ice cream was gone and it was mushed up!! Garvey blamed it on one of his friends but it didn't work. Thanks Garvey! :p

      I forgot to bring a camera for my convocation this year for Sheridan! So instead here's a picture from my convocation at York. Look at the funny hats! They're also known as jester hats or "samosa hats" (I don't know who made up that one...but it was probably Teresa). I don't know why but all our eyes are closed except for Helen's. She missed out!   urlLink    Convocation at York 2003 Helen, me, Garvey, Young and Carman

      My first blog! I had to ask Garvey to give me a nickname for my blog because I suck at it. I sat here for about 15 minutes thinking about a name...and I came up with the most boring names! Isn't that kind of retarded since I'm supposed to be creative person? It's like the plush toys I have which I name after what type of animal they are. There's Moose, Monkey, Brown Bear, Polar Bear....and a whole bunch of other ones. I think my brother and my sister influenced me. They name their stuffed toys the same way too!   I think Young will object to my Blog name since he loves pandas so much (it's an obsession!) He and Teresa are the best at coming up with nicknames. They made up the silliest nicknames for us in first year: Teresa was OmegaMoolahOne. She still uses it too! Mine was Mystifier because I get confused a lot (yeah I know that doesn't make sense). Young thought it was "Demystifier" for the longest time....I don't know why. Finally I said, "It's Mystifier!" It's ok though, it's not like we called each other with the nicknames a lot. :p

       urlLink     I don't remember who made it, but it was part of a student mural contest. I believe it's actually a series of photographs printed on canvas. So it's almost like a painting. It certainly is very painterly. I miss CFA...

      This always happens whenever relatives come over to visit -- we go out to eat. A lot. My aunt from New York is visiting this week.&nbsp;She's my dad's cousin (I think) and we call her "Biu Goo." So, today we went for dim sum in Chinatown&nbsp;at that restaurant on Spadina that's supposedly haunted. It was pretty good. Then for dinner we went to ANOTHER Chinese restaurant. At the end of the meal, they started&nbsp;fighting over the bill as Chinese people always do. Sometimes, this gets very loud and people start snatching the bill away to try to pay for it. Stealing the bill and hiding it from the other people is not uncommon. When the time comes to pay for the meal, they magically present the bill to the waiter while everyone else protests. People have also been known to sneak away and take the bill straight to the cash register to pay for it while everyone else is occupied with conversation. That method is probably the funniest one.   When I was little, I thought it was the most embarrassing thing when my parents and the other people got into the whole bill "fight". Sometimes it would last for 10 minutes!! I'm not kidding either. After a while, it started to become amusing. I think the waiters enjoy it too.

      I had one and a half glasses of beer...probably the most beer I've ever had! It got grosser the more I drank. But that's all I needed to get REALLY RED. Fortunately I didn't feel like passing out...although, I began feeling woozy when I went to the washroom -- so I got out of there quickly. Or at least I tried to! The lady inside the washroom turned on the tap when I came out of the stall, then she gave me soap, AND she gave me paper towel! The whole time I'm thinking, she better stop giving me stuff, I'm not going to tip her! Those washroom people are annoying.  Here's some pics:   urlLink    urlLink

      I had an annoying time this morning when I tried to look up the recipe for mojitos. And the reason is because I spelled it as "mohitos"! I'm so dumb. So I finally got the recipe but then my sister and I began debating about whether or not we should make mojitos or sangria tomorrow. It was like,   "Mojitos?"  "Yeah."  "Wait, no, sangria." "Ok." "But we have that bottle of rum from Helen!" "Ok fine, mojitos."  Later: "No, but wouldn't it be better if we made a pitcher of something rather than individual servings?" "Ok, sangria then." "Ok, I know! We make sangria then when that runs out we can make mojitos!" "Ok, fine. Stop talking about it."  And this whole time I kept on spelling mojitos with an "h". Mo-gee-toes. Mo-hee-toes.

      Apparently no one reads my blog anymore except Garvey and my sister. Actually I don't even know if Garvey has time since he's in Oakville trying to do textures in Photoshop with a Wacom tablet that's not fully functioning.   The good thing is...my bday is coming up!! woohoo!    Bad thing:  colour balancing in Photoshop is so annoying!  Good thing:  I applied to a job today!  Bad thing:  Woolfitt is going away for 1 1/2 months so I have no work to do!  Good thing:  I got paid by Woolfitt today. Yeah $15/h!  Bad thing:  I'm still at Walmart. :(  Good thing:  I tricked the TTC and I stopped over and bought something at Loomis and then went on the streetcar with the same transfer! hehe  ok that's it. I have no more. Well, I'm tired.
