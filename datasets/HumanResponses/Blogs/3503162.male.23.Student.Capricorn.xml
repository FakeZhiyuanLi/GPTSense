       So lighten up squirt :P  Like all new things, the first time is always seemingly meaningless. As if there wasn't enough things in the world to grimace at my virtual world, I mean our virtual world is taken over with even more things to grimace at. Shock, horror! Oh not the internet..........  Pretty interesting story @ : http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/29/1085641754841.html  I don't know, was it the pain? Was it the boredom? Did he feel stuck in the lift..... ok no more plagarism from now on :/  I guess you can make the world as beautiful as you want it to be, inside you.  Enough rambling by me, time to camp out on msn :P

       Back from canberra. Had much fun.  Kenny prob put pics up later.  Did a bit of shooting range, bowling, xbox, clubbing, soccer, stacking, and gay jokes.  Taliking about gay... from twg website  Luis Figo's loss of form seems to have affected his popularity with the Portuguese homosexual community as he has tumbled from number one in their poll according to figures released on Saturday on the website portugalgay.pt.

        Group A  Portugal need to pull something special against Spain with their only points comming against the hapless Russians. Whoever wins in the Spain vs Portgual match go through. If Portugal loses its curtains for them. If spain loses, the only way though for them is a lost of at least 2 for Greece but seeing how well the Greeks are playing and how poorly the Russians are playing, Spain will definately be playing for the win or a draw. If Portgual vs Spain is a draw, Portgual will be relying on Greece to lose to make it through. Russians are already eliminated so no comment for them.  Match to watch: Spain vs Portgual    Group B  The only way for Switzerland to go through is by beating France 4-0, but I won't be seeing that happen. England vs Croatia is a crunch match, whoever wins goes through and whoever loses its out for them. An England draw should see them through. France only require a draw to get through and even a loss might see them through if England vs Croatia ends in a draw.  Match to watch: England vs Croatia    Group C  1-1 Italy vs Sweden leaves Italy on 2 points after 2 games. They'll (Italy) pull through if they beat Bulgaria and either Sweden or Denmark get a win. But if Sweden vs Denmark is a draw, Italy needs to win at least 2-0 thats if the draw is 0-0 or 1-1, if its 1-1, im not sure whats going to happen because they would be on same goal difference with same amount of wins and the corresponding fixture between them was a draw. Interesting, somebody fill me in on that? You would say Sweden has a good chance of going through but if Denmark wins and Italy wins, they are out :/  Match to watch: Sweden vs Denmark    Group D  Its a bit too early to call, theres only been one game each for them. Even Latvia can win it from this stage. Group of death this group is.  Match to watch: Netherlands vs Czech Republic, this match should help shape the table   Tight groups so far, nobody has that special 6 points after two games.  My tippings for each group:  Group A : Greece and Spain  Group B : France and England  Group C : Sweden and Denmark  Group D : Czech Republic and too early too call

       Wow Greece aint going to bad! 1-1 draw with Spain. They might even progress with them playing the discontented Russians.  My fantasy football team isn't going too good though. I just don't know how to play it :/  Even the 5-0 win by sweden diddn't boost me much! Now im on 48 points, a shocking rank of 50,603/137,160 !!!  Better stick to Championship Manager.

       Sorry had to use that line, couldn't think of anything else to write.  Not very exciting day, had to wake up 6:30 to get to a meeting at uni. Got to uni at 8am, nothing was opened so that sucked, had to amuse myself for one hour........  Meeting was nothing special. Can't say anything exciting because that would be lying wouldn't it :P  Had to submit my diary for my clinical placement for the past 5 weeks. Yes a diary out of all things I had to submit.

       Spent today recovering from yesterday's game.  What a great game, great because I was finally on the winning team! Lots of familar faces, a new face, some old hats.  Photos will be up at Kenny's site in the near future I think.  Was a fair day with winds picking up later during the game and sun flashing into the eyes of the players. Haven't played in a while but somehow I lasted the 3 hours without too many injuries!  I bagged a few goals, let in twice as many though :P  Lots of sliding, haven't done that in awhile, felt pretty good, diddn't chop anybody down. Sorry don't remember any specifics :(  Go Sweden!

Ok I'm pretty pissed off about it.  Anyways who needs to watch it when you can play! Thats right folks, you can catch some of the folks that visit this board in the flesh for a bit of soccer action! I'm sure you are all dying to hear the details so here they are:   Kempt Field 2pm   You could possibly even catch me there! And beat me into submission for writing all these sucky posts and subjecting you to the written diarrohea.  Should be a great day! (maybe for me).

       Fustrated, tired, angry and generally pissed off!  Death, shit stares for all from me.  Had to spend all yesterday and all last night doing my portfolio, sapped all my energy it did. Also had a test today, I think I might had straight flunked it. Bloody outrage! Maybe I deserve it, I said a bad thing about a girl, my bad. Just not on, just isnt me.  Had to go home on the train standing, in the middle with no support. Man diddn't they know I was already too tired to do foot gymnastics.  Coming home is no better, got a mini-assignment due, I'm meant to compile group members' parts, they haven't sent anything and its due toBloodymorrow morning.   Just Great

       Gather up lads and lassies to listen to the story of the Scourge of the Riverwood Legions.  The fate of retired pirates is unknown to most land-lovers. For pirates, there is not Polly-want-a-cracker Nursing Home.  No, retired pirates go and cut down Cacti trees, the bane of most horticulturists.  Only the fearsome task of scathing the monstrototies known as the cactus can be entrusted to the fearsome pirates of an age long gone.  But the fate that fell upon a certain seasoned pirate is so gruesome, that it must be told.  There was a pirate his name long forgotten, who was contracted to remove one of these monoliths of spikes and pricks. Many a pirate would never leave their cabins without the right kind of specialised equipment. To do so would be as perilious as wrestling a 50-foot kraken. But this pirate whose name was long forgotten approached the task appointed ill equiped. He was up against the forces of nature. Bless his soul.  To cut this solemn tale short, the pirate ended up with spikes and pricks in places that were never meant to have spikes and pricks. The price that he paid will be discussion for every tavern from here to the end of the world.  WIth spikes in his eyes, the poor pirate required a patch covering his maimed eye. Rumour has it that it sparked the fashion that had pirates from here to the Madagascar Islands wearing the same patch over their eye. Hands swollen and blistered from pricks told of hardship endured. Clothes rendered useless were burnt.   T'is a sad tale indeed.  Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhh

       Thought I just add another entry today, not because I was bored but coz my mate told me to :P  Prob right now I'm having one of the "been let-down" feelings. Dissapointed, perhaps. Most likely yes.  Lots of work to do, more than people think I've got, more than I would care to admit, but of course I cbf doing it.  Dont think its gonna be a pleasant three weeks, I know i've done jack, but look at me, idiocy creeping in.  Time to shoot myself with a elastic band, either that or bang my fist on the wall the next time somebody enters my room.

       Had a mixed bag today. Pleasantly suprised to bump into a friend on the way to uni, nice one Mike.  Then it was shocker from there on. Shouldn't had got the seafood box, the food was pretty undercooked. But I wasn't paying much attention much to the distraught of my stomach later on.  Wasn't feeling too well the rest of the day :/  Down and out but having a blast, perhaps not having a blast but still down and out.  Time to shutup now, even I'm scaring myself silly with purple and yellow goosebumps.

       Well an unexpected poke to start the day :)  We got out early out of clinic which was good because I couldnt stand much longer! The preceptor is a good bloke but the work is deadly boring, pun intended.  Group partner went skitz at me for not completing a poster, well communication error there no need to go crazy on me.  Rural placements came out, unexpectantly got none of my four preferences! Somebody must hold a grudge against me!  The only expected thing was that the train was late again :P

       As requested.  Well a very boring day today. Woke up in an indifferent mood. Straight to playing warcraft and subsequently getting told off for doing so. Ate breakfast at 11ish, some weetbix which I havent had for awhile, got to try it tomorrow as well. Warcrafted till the arvo when I decided to fax in my resume for this job. Was waiting at the library for the fax to go through. Waited 40mins which I spent just walking around the library to find out it diddn't work. Oh well that sucked.  Got home at this strawberry-filling sponge cake. Was alright but kinda mushy inside. Cant remember what happened afterwards, must had been one of those mindless periods of the day I frequently experience. Dinner was some rice and battered fish. Now im on the intraweb chatting and (was) playing trivia.     The End.

       An interesting and enjoyable snow trip, more enjoyable for some than others.    So from the start.  We were waiting in a wet and rainy Sydney on a monday arvo. Arthur came along to see farewell and pickup some "magazines" and to see if he could offload his prize of his competition to anybody. Anyways this dingy and small mini-van pulls over. We jokingly say thats our bus, it in fact was our bus. So we had to get on this packed mini-van, packed that we just had enough seats and we had to put some luggage on the inside corridors. That was pretty povo.  Nothing much happened on the bus because everbody was pretty tired with the exception of this guy and girl that diddnt talk non-stop all the way and the guy had this insidious laugh that grated everybody's nerves. Also we learnt later that the trailer at the back in fact was to fall apart, would had been a classic to see it fall apart on the highway. Oh yeah who could forget the cool wind at the back of the bus!  So we arrived at Cooma to hire some gear and meet up with Lewis and then it was straight to Kookaburra lodge. We arrived at around 1:30-2 with the entire trip taking 9hrs for some reason. Diddn't really matter what time we made it anyways since it was hard to sleep with the snoring symphony playing. With 8 guys in the room, it sure was going to get messy.  The next day we were treated with breakfast with strickly no seconds allowed and we got on the bus where we introduced to the workings of an eccentric person. This person would usually talk to himself or sometimes to others in pretty gay fashion, diddnt mind using his hands either. Anyways it was snow time where most of us picked up the "skills" we aquired last time around, except me. We creamed the beginner lesson and it was off to the bars. Can't believe we diddnt go on any bars last time because it was quite fun, only because I diddnt crash....much, well not too much. After intially not being able to make it to the first post we got the hang of it and in no time we were up the slope ready to plunge down into people. On one run I was sliding into the tree and had to pull out but on the path of the pullout was a tree which I had to fully duck to avoid. Feeling pumped up about my close call, I stacked it 5 seconds later.  After a tiring and enjoyable first day at the snow it was time to get back to the lodge where we had an hour to get showered and ready for dinner. Well the logistics were a bit weird with like 30 guys sharing 5 showers and having 60mins to all shower. Lets say some had a certain Eau de Natural on them. Oh yeah Kirit had a cold shower because he thought there was no hot water when in fact the tap names were switched around!  Dinner was an upgraded version of bizzos. The food was so good and filling that some of us couldnt finish it. It was so good Kenny left a plate full! Desserts which nobody wanted was pretty interesting especially the Chocolate moouse (sp?) which had an onion topping. Nice combination to be had there.   Back to the lodge for chillout and sleep. There we learnt tricks like "Pickup Cards" and "Could you put your hand in my pants and get the wallet out of my pants because my hands are full". It was all good as we watched Dodgeball and the White Chick which was a crowd favourite.   Day two at the snow and we diddnt have a lesson till 1 so we did some runs including a chairlift run with me not knowing how to get off and stacking it at the entrance and on the first run I even got off early and was boarding onto the wooden floor! The run down was pretty fustrating with not knowing the course and having to skate across some flat areas. Kenny ran into a tree branch causing it to snap and Kirit full ran into him from behind! I got snowballed pretty badly by Kirit and Eric while I was just standing there, cheeky fellows! We had level two lessons which I couldnt do for jack because I suck pretty bad with toe edge so everytime I did it I ended up in the path of the T-bar. I had a pretty bad crash while I was following Eric in his speed trap. It was just a bit too much and I fell and jolted my head on the ground. Lost my goggles earlier on so that sucked.  The supposed free beer and pub crawl never eventuated so we went for dinner at some italian place which was pretty generous with its servings. One guy was meticolous in his approach to eating food, cutting a single bean 10 times. We spent the night playing hacky-sack which was pretty fun and taking some "special photos" which may or may not be on Kenny's website. Later it was time for drinks at the Jindabyne hotel which was pretty packed. After that it was off to Banjos or was it the place next to it. Played some streetfighter which I sucked pretty bad at it and we played some of table soccer game I forgotten the name for. Kenny just told me its called foosball. Just like real life I left it more goals than I scored and I even got some own goals! We played some crappy games on the touch screen and it was back to lodge for some sleep.   from kenny : I forgot to mention that there was this games/recreation room across the cabins which had this strange smell. It wasnt until later that we found it was some underground facility for which the asian guys used to make rice in their portable ricecookers and also to make instant noodles.  Third and final day of the snow and people were a little worse for wear. We did some runs with one memorable run when I was mimicing Kenny down the slope and he stacked it. Well the last movement he was doing was a horizontal board so I ran over him with the board sideways, clipping his board and stacking it fast first. Good one Kenny! I dogged the level 3 lessons to teach some of Thomas' friends how to snowboard. Only one was willing to listen and no suprises that he was the only one that was getting the hang of it! One of them full plundged at full speed, diddnt even bother to chicken out into this little kid. Pretty bad stack and the instructor that was with the kid full on told the guy off. They sucked pretty bad at going up the J-bar with one stacking it pretty early on and he diddnt even let go of the bar even when he was on the ground getting dragged by the bar. Everybody was like screaming out for him to let go but he was holding on for his dear life.   After the day at the snow it was time to head off back to Sydney. Back at the lodge we were told we couldnt use to toilet which was pretty gay to say the least.

       I saw an old man lying on the train platform this arvo, obviously he was upto something dangerous.  In an unrelated incident, a mate of mine broke his wrist, because..... ..no not that, because he jumped on a soccer ball with both feet and hurt his wrist supporting his fall. Such dangerous tactics!

       After a long break I returned to play soccer today at Riverwood Park with the big guns from the bevo bushrats. It was enjoyable to get back to kicking the shnitz out of the ball. What else can I say? Oh yeah I got into some dangerous tackles but I diddnt manage to injure myself. My foot twisted on its side while I was retrieving a ball somebody kicked out but it diddnt do any damage, oh well :/

       Went to a friend's bday celebration last night, great fun! We had to come and dress up in theme. Well letters starting with N or a P. There was some really cool ideas like the nun and priest and this pirate that looked just like Jack Sparrow! However the most popular choice would had to be "people" :/ Borrowing from my time at sths, I decided to be a nerd, quite easy thing to do. Steve Urkel is my idol! Not really but yeah. Anyways I had to be in this production number and I wasnt really too sure what I was meant to do so I just copied what other people did. Luckily I diddnt screw it. There was also some nice dance routines that you guys prob would had liked! Especially the bum song! Diddnt do much dangerous things, I tried jumping and off the stage but alas I diddnt stack it.

       Hey guys I made the news! Not exactly but my experience today did. After leaving a tutorial early and trying to find doom 3 at GB (couldnt find it) I went to catch a train home. Just my luck to just miss the train. I got on the next train, the train of pain.  Man did this train go the all so slow. I got on at around 10:40, got to my station at 1: 45. I kid you not, what was meant to be a 50min trip took over 3 hours. After numerous delays the train reached a point between Homebush and Flemington stations. I thought not another delay, wonder how long this one was going to be. Boy was I off target. We spent over and hour stationary. I thought that nobody else was in my carriage so I started to sing along to my music. Like 20mins later I heard somebody answering their mobile. Oh shit how embarassing, they must had heard my poor karoke skills :/ After an hour or so, people started to all come to my carriage. Mate, when theres no power to the train theres no air-conditioning and boy did some of the people stink bad. So for the next few minutes people were hurling abuse at the train guards and driver. This friggen weirdo came and sat next to me. I was listening to music starting outside the window when I felt somebody touch my hand. I turned around and saw this Indian guy saying stuff in a really low voice. I was like WTF! With the guy blocking the exit to the corridor I had no choice and respond to his weird ass comments. He even started to bang on the front seat saying, "This is no good, not good at all" in his soft voice. How bloody creepy! Luckily he pissed off and they decided to let people off to walk on the tracks. We went in small groups much to the disgust of some commuters.  Some of them were saying, "We arent school kids, we are grownups, what the fuck with the small groups?". Eventually I got off and walked on the tracks to a side gate. This reminded me off an incident during high school when the train was delayed for nearly 2 hrs and had to walk on the tracks to the station, Homebush. Wonder if this is a co-incidence. Needless to say I arrived at school bloody late, like after lunch time! Anyways everybody had to wait on the street for the bus. If you watched the news today you might had seen footage of it. Another great-mix with the bus drivers given the wrong route so the buses to get us were delayed. Not everybody got on the bus so another buy was supposed to come in 5mins time. It came like 20mins later. Being a seasoned veteran of crappy public transport I diddn't lose my patience just yet. When we got to Lidcombe station, I just missed the train as I was on top of the stairs. Not happy Jan! Got a seafood box from the tuck-shop at the station. I think the seafood box gave me pretty bad food poisioning.  Anyways I got Doom 3 from EB when I got home. Bloody crashes on my computer after 5mins. Just great!
