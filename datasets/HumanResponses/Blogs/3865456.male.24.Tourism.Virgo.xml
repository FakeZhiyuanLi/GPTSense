      May as well make use of this space I'm got. Knowing me, I'll use it 3 times and then not bother. Well, just to get up to speed, let me tell you the state of play.     Having done nothing (according to my father) since university, (left in June 2000), I applied to join the Army and go to officer training. Things were going along quite well until I snapped my Achilles Tendon during a football game. Was given the option by the Dr to have it in a cast for 3 months, or have surgery and have it strung up for 2 months. Went for the speedy option, thinking in my naivete that I would be up and running about one month after that. To say I was gutted when after the final cast was removed, I was told by the Dr that I could do nothing on it for 6 months (takes me to December of this year) would be putting it mildly.     So that poohed on the Army until the following May. I have been working in a Call Centre speaking to the over 50's and getting them out on holiday. Not really the job of dreams. I didn't mind it at first as it was just work, tiding me over as I applied for the army. And with an end date, it was easy to go in, do the work and then walk out. Suddenly, this job was then it! Very depressing.     Don't believe in fate, but soon after this all came to pass, while chatting to a friend at lunch (we have a good restaurant at work, very reasonably priced too), she told me that she was leaving her job as product manager to go become a school teacher. On paper, this looked to be the kind of job I have been after since Uni. Anyway, to cut a long story short, applied and got the job and start in on the 1st Monday of August.     Got the good news on Monday. On the basis that this was going to be a good week for me, decided to ask a girl I've liked for awhile out for dinner. Taking her out in 2 weeks time. In the mean time, she will be cooking me dinner. Result. Think I'll play the lottery this Saturday, see if good luck comes in 3's too!!

      Heard a little about this blog stuff and thought it might be away of getting info out to people. Hate receiving emails from people addressed to 50 people (that's not directed at anyone), so it would be a bit hypocritical to send them myself. This way I guess, if people have any interest in my life, they can make the effort themselves. (That started sounding quite pathetic :-)  Only really started this as I was bored. Now I'm irritated as I cannot get my photo on the blog. I've read stuff and downloaded something that I believed would make getting pictures on the site as easy as, but either the instructions are the equivalent of Ikea instructions or my grasp of English isn't as good as I thought it was.
